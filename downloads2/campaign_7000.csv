</h3> <p>Inspired by the spectacle that is inherent to professional wrestling, we are an art collective formed in celebration of feminine identities and subversion of traditional gender roles and expectations.</p>
<p>The <a href=""www.leagueofladywrestlers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">League Of Lady Wrestlers</a> was founded by artists with a common desire to explore the
 intersections between performance and the male gaze in visual culture. The <a href=""wclolw.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">West Coast League Of Lady Wrestlers</a> is the 
newest baby sister of our wild, weird and wonderful family. Compiled by 
artists from various backgrounds living on Vancouver Island and
 the British Columbia Mainland, we collaborate to craft our performances
 in the spirit of spectacle sports, humour and the accessibility of art.</p>

<h3>⚡What We Need &amp; What You Get⚡</h3> <p><b>We are hoping to raise $2500. This will go towards:</b></p>
<p><b> ♥   Renting our venue</b> - We have chosen to host the Velvet Rut Rumble at the Victoria Edelweiss Club Hall. It's not easy to find a venue willing to host a wrestling match, nor is it cheap! $1000 will go towards the hall rental including insurance, taxes and fees.</p>
<p><b>♥   Renting our ring</b> - The cost to rent our wrestling ring is $1000. Renting a proper wrestling ring is a safer alternative than building our own. <br/></p>
<p><b>♥   </b>The extra funds will go towards the cost of printing our promotional 
material and tickets, renting film and sound equipment, contributions for the band, videographers and photographers, and our liquor license.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What you can get:</b><br/></p>
<p><b>♥</b>   A <i>personalized</i> headshot from your favourite wrestler. You can
 specify who you would like to receive a message from or it can be a surprise! This will be mailed to you after the event or can be collected at the merchandise table at the Velvet Rut Rumble. <br/></p>
<p><b>♥</b>  A limited-edition set of WCLOLW trading cards featuring all of our wrestlers!<br/></p>
<p><b>♥</b>   Tickets to the match (guaranteed seats!)<br/></p>
<p><b>♥</b>   A limited edition WCLOLW Velvet Rut Rumble t-shirt designed and hand-printed by our very own Grant Hash. <br/></p>

<h3>⚡⚡The Impact⚡⚡</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are a group of working-class mortals, performers, artists and students. In the ring we are unapologetically brash, brave, gross, loud, smelly, funny and exuberant. We are bitches and heroines. We are loveable and not likeable. We support each other in these choices.  <br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kind of raucous entertainment requires a start-up capital that is above the capabilities of our combined working-class pay-cheques. <br/></p>
<p>Your contribution will help us get this chapter of our organization established, and allow us to<br/></p>
<p><b>♥</b>   Promote and embrace justice in gender equity<br/></p>
<p><b>♥</b>   Keep our events affordable so they are accessible to our community<br/></p>
<p><b>♥</b>   Expand upon our already successful League Of Lady Wrestlers events</p>
<p>Anyone
 who has attended League Of Lady Wrestlers events can attest to the amount of work that 
went into putting on our shows with very little resources. </p>
<p>We hope with a little bit of funding under our championship belts we can make the West Coast League of Lady Wrestlers events a bi-annual occurrence<span>! <br/></span></p>

<h3>⚡⚡! Risks + Challenges !⚡⚡</h3>
<p>We have received an enormous amount of support throughout our LOLW herstory, however this West Coast chapter of the league is in the infant stages of developing on new turf. The WCLOLW is currently an unregistered art collective and depends on 
crowd-sourced funding, small grants available to grassroots arts and 
social justice organizations and our personal funds. In order to qualify for larger arts grants available in British Columbia such as the CRD Arts Development and BC Arts Council, we must be registered as a non-profit artist collective. This registration is a lengthy process that can take a couple years of balanced budgets, exhibition history, and representation from registered non-profit arts societies and members of Pacific Association of Artist Run Centres. <br/></p>
<p>Our first show on the West Coast is a very bold and risky D.I.Y. project! Our success depends on the countless hours our devoted performers, organizers and volunteers generously donate to the league. But we believe it's worth it! <br/></p>
<p>League Of Lady Wrestlers events are more than just a simple battles between faces and heels. Our audacious, dynamic spectacles invite every participant to celebrate the desire to push back against oppressive cultural values. We join together to suspend disbelief and hold on to optimism about the possibilities of empowerment, gender equity, and community.<br/></p>

<p><b>HAGATHA CRISPY ~ </b>mystery novelist and editor by day, gentrification fighter by night! She
 lives alone in an old mansion on the water. Her elderly neighbors have
 all passed away and their children have sold the land to an evil 
developer for it’s increasing high value. But Agatha knows she’ll be 
alive for a while yet and fully intends to stay put. Agatha knows of a 
brewing plan to replace her home and the quaint seaside land, filled 
with trees and their wild inhabitants, in favour of a large luxury condo
 development on land stripped of it’s native flora and fauna.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>JEAN SPAWNDA</b> ~ Hailing from the deepest aquatic caves of the ninth planet, this slime 
sucking, collarbone crushing alien badass is here on earth for one 
reason: TOTAL DOMINATION. Her unearthly band of female warriors, the 
CLITERATTI have a lust for impregnating their enemies with their 
signature oozing slime.  Don't let her get you in a hold or you'll find 
yourself waking up to a bellyful of extraterrestrial spawn.</p>
<p><b>INNA DEMON</b> ~ <span><span><span><span><span>Years
 can pass between sightings, and just when you begin to doubt their 
existence, this malevolent being will appear seemingly out of nowhere, 
and will drag you down. They are known for their vicious cycles of self 
loathing and social anxiety, masked by an exterior of binge drinking, 
reckless behavior and loud living - often with an unapologetic, angry 
demeanor. When your life is trash they will be there.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><b>STEEL KEGAL</b> ~  a master of discipline, having spent her whole fighting career guarding
 her most prized weapon: her virginity. Painstakingly preventing her 
precious flower from being sullied has allowed her to amass an 
incredible amount</span><span><span> of pent-up energy that
 she unleashes at a moments notice on whoever dares cross her. Her 
signature move, the hymen maneuver, looks much like a reach-around grab 
but she insists that ""its all in the hymen"". Opponents have long tried 
to pop her cherry (which looks very much like a red helium balloon that 
she carries with her) with the hope that this will allow her to chill out already, thereby sapping her power.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Roaming the western skies, Ursa seeks to maul trophy hunting males who celebrate their kill of fierce grizzly women. She's been healing during a long winter hibernation; now awake and ready for murderous rancor on the dude-bros who colonize the landscape and rape for their trophy hunting sport. Bear witness to Ursa's truculency as she wades heavily in the water of the Salish Sea, waiting for the west coast brawl to commence.

<p>MEDOUCHEA ~ After being victim-blamed for a series of sexual assaults over a lifetime in the underworld, Medouchea has one goal and one goal only: the eternal quest for revenge on all douchebaggery. Blinded by bitterness, her wrath extends basically to anything that moves. Womanizers of the world beware – she’s got extra-special loathing for your type and legend has it her douche will immobilize you. She’s a true villain. Every ounce of goodness has been rinsed right out of her. Now this one’s thirsty for death squadding.</p>
<p>PANDORA DEATH BOX ~ Pandora Death Box has finally escaped the domesticated sphere of her crabby Scottish husband. Returning to the sacred muir as her old Selkie sea witch self, Pandora Death Box is on a mission to reclaim the many sealskins of her lost sisters despite the claustrophobic restrictions of patriarchy and its many prescribed boxes. Awaiting her prey in beds of bull kelp, she watches for any crusty oppressor creeping the shoreline. Fuelled by her Selkie ancestors, Pandora Death Box uses her transformative power to shapeshift and her deep emotional rage to mobilize oceanic whirlpools of DOOM. Tangling her opponents into Celtic knots of fury and blissfully whipping their booties, she attempts to release the sheer evil out of any unwelcome visitor. Watch out for her seaweed and crude oil upchuck when she barks. The aroma is foul and toxic...</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am passionate about the arts and life and my work is concerned with experiences that pass the thresholds of intellect and emotion. In addition to being an award winning artist, performer and musician, I study and research on behavioural transformation; I am a coach and professional facilitator and member of the Mindfulness Association UK. I feel honoured to be collaborating with brilliant artists, scientists, musicians and performers, with The Koppel Project cultural centre (London, UK) and the Skironio Museum Polychronopoulos (Attica, Greece). Alongside their support, I have been self-funding a big part of my research and practice and now need all the help I can get to take the project further.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Link to The Koppel Project (Baker street, London) website: <a href=""http://thekoppelproject.com/elefsis-minotaur-arrival/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thekoppelproject.com/elefsis-minotaur-arrival/</a></p>
<p>ELEFSIS (means 'Arrival' in Greek) is a site-specific performance experience that uses art/visuals, sound/music, dance theatre, words and interaction to challenge participants’ perceptual systems. The audience is a key part of the work; this piece will be inspiring participants discover interesting aspects of themselves. It is a work in progress and part of ongoing research on human perception, ambiguity, dislocation and the Rites of Passage. It brings together attitudes of play, curiosity, mindfulness and sharing, and concepts from Augusto Boal's educational Theatre and Plato's writings on Antique Greek Tragedy and Rites. Your support is crucial for enabling this research to progress and for ELEFSIS to be initially showcased in London, UK  and Athens, Greece. Feedback from the initial shows will inform and transform this work going forward.</p>
<p>The experience uses the concept of the Minotaur as a starting point and focuses on the moment that the creature arrives at the Labyrinth. Each participant is, at the same time, a visitor and a Minotaur and their labyrinth is both a physical and mental operational frame. A number of sensory stimuli, acts and games throughout the performance lead or enable each participant to make choices and this is the point where the experience becomes totally subjective and open to diverse narratives and interpretations. The piece aims to initiate a self-discovery and put forward questions such as:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Structure: The piece is a promenade in five rooms/stages; Each room has its unique visual and sound installation. Five performers, including myself, will be interacting with the audience. In London, the experience is designed for 18 people at a time, given the specifics of the venue. In Greece, the number of audience/participants per each performance will grow as space is bigger. The site-specific nature of ELEFSIS allows it to adapt to any given space and environment.</p>
<p>Although I have limited funds, I am determined not only to present a work of high caliber but also to pay my fellow artists/performers for their contribution. Your backing will allow me to do that and to also create a good quality video documentation that will help me to seek further support from arts organisations and festivals.</p>
<p>In essence, funds will go to:</p>
<p>60% Production costs UK &amp; Greece (including all kinds of material) &amp; video costs</p>
<p>30% artists/performers initial remuneration</p>
<p>10% admin &amp; marketing</p>
<p>If the campaign exceeds its goal, then any additional fund will go towards travel expenses for the whole team to deliver the show in Greece, in 2018.</p>
<p>If the campaign does not reach its full goal it will still help me, as will subsidise for part of the existing costs and I will be forever grateful! Any help is much appreciated.</p>

<p>I trust and hope we will all be in good health; apart from that and from any unforeseen events such as earthquakes, we are determined to realise this project and share a truly meaningful and useful experience with the audience!

</div><h3>A big thanks to all!</h3></div>","Summary
I am passionate about the arts and life and my work is concerned with experiences that pass the thresholds of intellect and emotion. In addition to being an award winning artist, performer and musician, I study and research on behavioural transformation; I am a coach and professional facilitator and member of the Mindfulness Association UK. I feel honoured to be collaborating with brilliant artists, scientists, musicians and performers, with The Koppel Project cultural centre (London, UK) and the Skironio Museum Polychronopoulos (Attica, Greece). Alongside their support, I have been self-funding a big part of my research and practice and now need all the help I can get to take the project further.
 
Link to The Koppel Project (Baker street, London) website: http://thekoppelproject.com/elefsis-minotaur-arrival/
ELEFSIS (means 'Arrival' in Greek) is a site-specific performance experience that uses art/visuals, sound/music, dance theatre, words and interaction to challenge participants’ perceptual systems. The audience is a key part of the work; this piece will be inspiring participants discover interesting aspects of themselves. It is a work in progress and part of ongoing research on human perception, ambiguity, dislocation and the Rites of Passage. It brings together attitudes of play, curiosity, mindfulness and sharing, and concepts from Augusto Boal's educational Theatre and Plato's writings on Antique Greek Tragedy and Rites. Your support is crucial for enabling this research to progress and for ELEFSIS to be initially showcased in London, UK  and Athens, Greece. Feedback from the initial shows will inform and transform this work going forward.
The experience uses the concept of the Minotaur as a starting point and focuses on the moment that the creature arrives at the Labyrinth. Each participant is, at the same time, a visitor and a Minotaur and their labyrinth is both a physical and mental operational frame. A number of sensory stimuli, acts and games throughout the performance lead or enable each participant to make choices and this is the point where the experience becomes totally subjective and open to diverse narratives and interpretations. The piece aims to initiate a self-discovery and put forward questions such as:

What is the relationship of Presence and Absence and how it defines my experiences? 
How can I deal with a sense of constant move and ambiguity – how does this influence my perception and mental state?
Let’s say I am arriving in a place, a time-frame, a relationship or a goal; arriving in life itself. How do I deal with the act of being here? What is the reality that I chose to experience and how my choice shapes my relationship with myself and others? Where am I really, right now?

<p><span>
</span></p>
<p>As we launch this campaign, the man will burn in 52 days.
The Temple will burn in 53. The journey to this point has been one full of collaboration,
learning, and incredible achievement. We carry all these lessons forward with us in these final days, hours, and minutes before we head to playa. We also carry a deep appreciation for the people, like you, who enable us to give this gift to the community.</p>
<p>Many of the elegant arches that comprise
the Temple are finished and await transport to the playa. Construction of the rest
is charging forward on schedule at an exciting pace. We have the processes and
the know-how to build them and incredible momentum from our beautiful,
dedicated volunteers. With a crew like ours, there is little that can hold us
back, but we need help overcoming our last financial hurdle. Giving now ensures that the Temple of Promise reaches its full potential; becomes an awe-inspiring structure that will amaze even the builders now so intimate with its individual parts. </p>
<p>The Burning Man Arts Honorarium grant was the seed that got
us started, but every temple crew is responsible for raising the lion’s share
of the funds necessary to purchase materials and tools needed to build the Temple,
transport it to the playa, and support our on-playa team as they erect your
temple, the Temple of Promise. <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We believe that it is a boon to the community that it is our collective responsibility to raise these funds and we are proud to reach out to you for help.</span></p>

Wow!  150% funded at our close.  Thank you generous donors!  Our campaign is now In Demand which means we can still accept donations before we head out to playa.
Thanks to this amazing community, we have closed our budget shortfall, and are looking to raise only about $5000 to complete the project.  If you can give, or know someone who can, please help us out.
See you in the dust!

Thank you for your donations and thank you for sharing this project. 

This Temple burns in 47 days

The Temple of Promise...
 


As we launch this campaign, the man will burn in 52 days.
The Temple will burn in 53. The journey to this point has been one full of collaboration,
learning, and incredible achievement. We carry all these lessons forward with us in these final days, hours, and minutes before we head to playa. We also carry a deep appreciation for the people, like you, who enable us to give this gift to the community.
Many of the elegant arches that comprise
the Temple are finished and await transport to the playa. Construction of the rest
is charging forward on schedule at an exciting pace. We have the processes and
the know-how to build them and incredible momentum from our beautiful,
dedicated volunteers. With a crew like ours, there is little that can hold us
back, but we need help overcoming our last financial hurdle. Giving now ensures that the Temple of Promise reaches its full potential; becomes an awe-inspiring structure that will amaze even the builders now so intimate with its individual parts. 
The Burning Man Arts Honorarium grant was the seed that got
us started, but every temple crew is responsible for raising the lion’s share
of the funds necessary to purchase materials and tools needed to build the Temple,
transport it to the playa, and support our on-playa team as they erect your
temple, the Temple of Promise. We believe that it is a boon to the community that it is our collective responsibility to raise these funds and we are proud to reach out to you for help.

 

How much does the Temple cost?

Wood & other materials ($152,000):  The beautiful untreated
poplar we are using was selected for its aesthetic, quality and economy, and
this Temple uses a LOT of it. 32 Temple arches of increasing size are connected
by over 2.5 miles of ‘ribs’.


Transportation ($15,000): It will take 6 flatbed trucks to take the Temple
– plus all of the tools and equipment we need – the 323 miles from Alameda, CA
to Black Rock City, NV. 


Insurance ($5,000): Gotta have it!


Build spaces ($16,000): The rent we pay for our Alameda space and our
American Steel space in Oakland.


Burn supplies ($6,000):  For burn
related needs; includes additional firewood, burlap, fuel, and paraffin wax.


Leave No Trace tools ($11,000): Decomposed granite and LNT tools;
​required to protect the playa from the burn and to ensure we leave no trace
afterward.


Grove Trees ($45,000): The cost to fabricate the three
metal Trees that will be in the courtyard of the Temple of Promise.


On-playa power and lighting ($17,000): For build-related power and
lights; ​use of power tools, lighting, etc. during the two weeks of building on
the playa as well as a generator and fuel for our underground power grid to
keep the Temple lit throughout the event.


Build camp ($13,000): Our 130 volunteer builders will be arriving to
construct the Temple on playa 2 weeks before the gates of Burning Man
officially open. For them, building the Temple is a labor of love, but they
cannot do it without your support. Power, lights, fuel, food, water, shelter,
safety equipment, insurance, shade, and more. They will be giving their all, we
need to make sure they can do so safely.

Stretch Goal: Copper ($30,000): The shimmering copper
cowl featured on the immense skyward-reaching spire of the Temple will inspire awe
in all those who will enter.
Total Cost:  $280,000
To date, we have raised $240,000 .  We are asking our community to help us raise $20,000 to $50,000 with this campaign.  
The Temple of Promise belongs to everyone – not only to those
most able to give, not only to those who live in the Bay Area and have the time
and ability to come build with us.  All of
Burning Man is a communal effort.  Everyone who gives what they can in whatever way they can is part of the Temple crew. Now is
the time where your gift will benefit every burner who visits and connects with
the Temple.
Please join us now in building this temple together.

'A big welcome to our Refugee Week arts festival'

Hi all, my name is Sam Holland, a theatre-maker from Sheffield and I'm coordinating Migration Matters Festival, a Pay What You Decide arts and theatre festival at Theatre Delicatessen during Refugee Week, 17-25th June 2016.


Working alongside me is Sarah Sharp from Theatre Delicatessen, a producer who supports emerging artists by providing spaces for creative projects, ideas and experimentation.

This will be the second year we organise an arts festival for Refugee Week after Refuge Festival, 2015 (see pictures below).

Within the vast interior of an Old Woolworths, our programme will feature arts performances and activities that comment on or celebrate the UK as a sanctuary for refugees, asylum seekers and other victims of forced migration, and recognising the enormous contribution they have brought to this country, as well as raising awareness of the issues that surround the current refugee crisis.

We have invited established companies, emerging artists, community arts groups & charitable organisations to be part of a rich and soulful programme that brings the diverse and global mix of Sheffield's communities together in a celebration of food, culture and performance.

In order for us to build this exciting programme and allow all of it's communities to engage however we need as much help and support for the project as possible.

Previous Experience: Refuge Festival

During Refugee Week last year, with little resources & no funding we put together an arts programme that was smaller but just as bracing & dynamic. 




           
Refuge Festival Poster Image                     Refuge Festival Programme (2015)



We proudly welcomed hundreds of people through the doors of the Deli to enjoy music, theatre, fashion, film, debates, food & more.

This year however we to amplify those elements and build on the foundations of last years success by bringing in more people to enjoy a wider and more diverse programme.


Risks & Challenges

There's no doubt organising a festival of this scale will have it's hurdles, whether it's securing high profile companies and artists, transforming a formerly abandoned Woolworths into a hospitable haven or getting word out to all of Sheffield's far reaching postcodes.

However, who better to combat and relish those challenges than  a meticulously organised production team, who between them posses a wealth of experience & who are all ardently committed to the project and the causes it supports.


The festival is also supported by Sheffield Theatres who have provided artist support, the charities; City of Sanctuary, Arts on the Run, Assist, Refugee Council & SYMAAG, all of whom the team meets regularly and who have been an enormous help in informing their service users, their members and the general public.

<h3>L'impact/ The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> Ce travail fait suite à trois années de travail artistique sur le thème de l'écoute d'espaces distants et inaccessibles. Au cours de ces recherches j'ai pu rencontrer et échanger mes idées avec de nombreux artistes, chercheurs et ingénieurs, en Angleterre comme en France. 'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' est le premier projet d'envergure que j'organiserai dans ma ville d'origine et l'occasion de soumettre mon travail à un large public, ainsi que de me mesurer aux artistes établis. A travers la perspective sonore que je proposerai de la ville, je souhaite enrichir et encourager le dialogue entre les scènes françaises et anglaises de l'art et de la recherche sonore.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">---------------------</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p>'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' was inspired by three years of artistic experimentations focusing on the listening of places located 'just outside of our reach'. During this time, I have met many artists, researchers and engineers with whom I had the chance to discuss my ideas and realizations. 'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' is the first project I will realize in Paris after having moved to London three years ago. It is an opportunity for me to propose a sonic perspective on the city I originate from and to show my work to a large audience of artists, curators, art critics and members of the public. Through this project, I hope to enrich and stimulate the dialogue between the British and the French Sound Art scenes.<br/></p>

'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' est une installation pour microphone, ballon d'helium et système de communication sans fil.

Il me reste à réunir $1400 (environ 1000€) pour compléter ce système et le transformer en une oeuvre d'art retentissante! Grâce à Indigogo et Paypal, je peux accéder à l'argent immédiatement afin de commencer la construction de l'installation dès maintenant.

Représentation 3D de l'installation
---------------------

'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' is an installation for wireless microphone and helium balloon. Listening to the sounds captured by a microphone hovering above the city, the audience is taken on an 'out of body' journey into the atmosphere of the capital. 
My project has just been selected to be part of the 'Nuit Blanche 2011', a contemporary arts festival happening once a year in Paris. Artists from
 all over the world are invited to create work for one night in the streets, gardens,
 museums, schools, churches of the city.
'Nuit Blanche' is giving me the opportunity to realize 'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' in a magnificent garden located in Montmartre, right down by the Sacré-Coeur. The festival is taking care of the promotion of the artwork as well as of the security during the event. 

listen to the sound of the parc at night here.

I have found three sponsors who have generously offered to lend me most of the equipment I need to construct the installation. 

I
 now need to find $1400 (about £900) in order to gather the last 
ingredients I need to transform my sketches into a artwork in its own 
right ! Using Indigogo and paypal, I can access the money immediatly and start constructing the piece.

L'impact/ The Impact

 Ce travail fait suite à trois années de travail artistique sur le thème de l'écoute d'espaces distants et inaccessibles. Au cours de ces recherches j'ai pu rencontrer et échanger mes idées avec de nombreux artistes, chercheurs et ingénieurs, en Angleterre comme en France. 'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' est le premier projet d'envergure que j'organiserai dans ma ville d'origine et l'occasion de soumettre mon travail à un large public, ainsi que de me mesurer aux artistes établis. A travers la perspective sonore que je proposerai de la ville, je souhaite enrichir et encourager le dialogue entre les scènes françaises et anglaises de l'art et de la recherche sonore.

---------------------

'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' was inspired by three years of artistic experimentations focusing on the listening of places located 'just outside of our reach'. During this time, I have met many artists, researchers and engineers with whom I had the chance to discuss my ideas and realizations. 'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' is the first project I will realize in Paris after having moved to London three years ago. It is an opportunity for me to propose a sonic perspective on the city I originate from and to show my work to a large audience of artists, curators, art critics and members of the public. Through this project, I hope to enrich and stimulate the dialogue between the British and the French Sound Art scenes.

Ce dont le projet a besoin et ce que vous recevrez en échange/ What I need and what you get.


'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' est soutenu par Tapages, Creatmosphere et StudioTime qui fournissent respectivement:
-l'essentiel de l'équipement sonore (microphone, transmission sans fil, distributeur de casque), 
-un gros ballon éclairé de l'intérieur
 -la documentation visuelle du projet
J'ai besoin de votre soutien pour construire la structure d'arrimage du ballon, acheter des écouteurs et les adapter à la structure afin d'acheminer les sons du microphone jusqu'aux oreilles des visiteurs, acheter suffisamment d'helium, imprimer un livret qui accompagnera la visite de l'oeuvre, élaborer le décor (costume d''explorateur sonore', petits ballons, etc..)
Vous trouverez ci-dessous le décompte des éléments correspondant aux $1400: l'objectif à atteindre pour povoir  réaliser 'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris'. 
J'ai prévu différentes contreparties en échange de votre participation comme une série limité d'images imprimées du projet, les enregistrements audio du microphone suspendu ou même une performance sur mesure! (voir 'perks', à droite de cette présentation où vous pouvez contribuer à l'oeuvre et voir ce qui vous sera envoyé en échange). Ces cadeaux de remerciements vous seront envoyés dès l'installation terminée.

- Accessoires: $100
- Helium: $150
- Impression du Livret: $250
- Pièces pour la construction de la structure d'arrimage (bois et métal): $400
- fabrication d'une trentaine de casques audio (composants éléctroniques, cables): $500

Si l'objectif des $1400 est dépassé, cela permettra tout simplement à l'oeuvre d'accueillir plus de visiteurs simultanément. (plus de casques et plus de livrets)

---------------------

'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris' is supported by three companies: Tapages, Creatmosphere and StudioTime which will provide respectively:
-the main sound system (wireless microphone, headphone amplifier),

-the visual documentation of the project. 
I need your help to build the structure that will hold the main balloon, buy headphones and adapt them to the structure, buy helium in sufficient quantity, print a program note and design the set (e.g 'sound explorer costumes', small balloons).
Here is the breakdown of the $1400 which I need to gather to be able to realize 'Des Sons du Ciel de Paris'. To thank you for your donations, I offer a series of perks such as limited edition prints of the artwork, audio recordings from the sky of Paris and even a tailor-made 'balloon performance' !

- Accessories: $100
- Helium: $150
- Printing of the program note: $250
- Structure on which the balloon will be attached (wood and metal): $400
- Fabrication of 30 headphones (electronics): $500

It was the summer before my thesis year and I was battling an extreme amount of performance anxiety. I felt like people were expecting me to succeed and write the most amazing brilliant earth-shattering piece of theatre ever written. I spent week after week trying to create one hell of a musical and putting myself under the most unrealistic expectations. I cracked one day because I simply couldn't handle the pressure. I felt like I failed and experienced my very first panic attack. That's when I knew something was up--that's when I knew I wasn't okay. I sought counseling because it was free to all NYU Tisch students and my counselor told me A) You're depressed and B) Maybe you just need to fill your well. Go see a movie. And she was absolutely right: my well was empty. I had nothing to create from, no inspiration to pull from, no story to tell. How could I create if I was creating from a place of end-picture ideologies. That thinking is never going to merit good work--well, I shouldn't say never but it certainly wasn't working for me. The Filling the Well Artist's Retreat feels like the perfect synthesis of who I am and the experiences I want to share with others. It's a place I want artists to come to make things the way I like to make things. A place where you are given absolute permission. And a place where you fill your well by getting away from the city, surrounding yourself with other artists, exposing yourself to new territories and opening yourself up to whatever comes your way.</span><br style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;""/><br style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;""/><span style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;""></span><br style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;""/><span style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt; font-weight: bold;""><font size=""6"" style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;"">Q: </font><font size=""4"" style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;"">Can you tell me about a little bit about the background of the home you are taking the artists to?</font></span><br style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;""/><font size=""6"" style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;"">A:     </font><font size=""4"" style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;"">                  </font><br style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;""/><font size=""4"" style=""margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;"">...The home we are going to is my Aunt Cece and Godmother Mary's home.

It's full of loving energy, mystery, and their spirit and it was heartbreaking to have this house sitting on 2.5 acres of land, in the middle of historic Doylestown, only 2 and 1/2 hours from the city stay empty, cold, and unlived in. It was screaming ""use me, make use of me."" And I knew in my gut, in my heart, in every nerve ending in my being that I needed to do something about it. My family who all live on the Westcoast, where I'm originally from know I'm hosting the retreat and are in complete support of Filling the Well. Our wish is to build on the land. For  example, we'd like build a black box theatre to help establish the retreat as a regular artist haven. It's screaming potential. The house doesn't have any doors, it's all open--all the bedrooms, like an orphanage. Exactly as I want the artists to be--you don't need much, just a great group of people and enthusiasm and suddenly there's genius at your fingertips. There is a garage with an office next door, an empty sun room, kitchen, dining area, gazebo. My boyfriend and I went to clean the place up a few weeks ago to make space for all the artists. I'm excited to see what the house feels like once bodies are in it. It will always be Cece and Mary's home though and I know people will be respectful of that. It's a special place and you can't help but feel their warmth wrapped up all around you when you're there. The home feels like a gift. A gift that cannot go to waste.

What is Filling the Well?An interview with Diana OhQuestions curated by, Christine Drew Benjamin


Q: How did you come up with the idea behind Filling the Well?A:                ...I came up with the idea of  ""Filling the Well"" because of something I came across when I was in Grad school at NYU. It was the summer before my thesis year and I was battling an extreme amount of performance anxiety. I felt like people were expecting me to succeed and write the most amazing brilliant earth-shattering piece of theatre ever written. I spent week after week trying to create one hell of a musical and putting myself under the most unrealistic expectations. I cracked one day because I simply couldn't handle the pressure. I felt like I failed and experienced my very first panic attack. That's when I knew something was up--that's when I knew I wasn't okay. I sought counseling because it was free to all NYU Tisch students and my counselor told me A) You're depressed and B) Maybe you just need to fill your well. Go see a movie. And she was absolutely right: my well was empty. I had nothing to create from, no inspiration to pull from, no story to tell. How could I create if I was creating from a place of end-picture ideologies. That thinking is never going to merit good work--well, I shouldn't say never but it certainly wasn't working for me. The Filling the Well Artist's Retreat feels like the perfect synthesis of who I am and the experiences I want to share with others. It's a place I want artists to come to make things the way I like to make things. A place where you are given absolute permission. And a place where you fill your well by getting away from the city, surrounding yourself with other artists, exposing yourself to new territories and opening yourself up to whatever comes your way.Q: Can you tell me about a little bit about the background of the home you are taking the artists to?A:                       ...The home we are going to is my Aunt Cece and Godmother Mary's home. Aunt Cece passed away this past February and Mary passed 10 years ago. As a family, we are still healing and mourning the loss of two unbelievable human beings. They ran an adoption agency together and lived with one another in this home for almost thirty years. It's housed many animals.

<h2><strong>Who Am I?</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Siyi Qian, and I come from Beijing, China. I am majoring in Business Design and Arts Leadership at Savannah College of Arts and Design (SCAD). To fulfill my final project in the M.A. Business Design and Arts Leadership graduate program, I am curating a visual art exhibition titled <i>The Creative Mixture of Art</i> in Savannah, Georgia.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>About The Exhibition</h2>
<p><i>The Creative Mixture of Art </i>is a visual arts exhibition that will be open from August 4 to August 6, 2017 at the Sulfur Studios at 2301 Bull St. in Savannah, Georgia. The opening reception will be held on August 4 from 5 pm to 9 pm, which is the first Friday monthly Art March day in Savannah. It is free to the public with foods and drinks.</p>
<p>This exhibition will provide a platform for young artists to exhibit their mixed arts and express their creative ideas. This exhibition will showcase 30 artworks from two SCAD Graduate students, Hanting Zhang and Siqiao Liu, who are majoring in Painting. Hanting Zhang’s pop mixture portraits combine the western and eastern cultures to use superheroes as subject to uphold justice. Siqiao Liu’s mixed media paintings combine different cultures and art forms to show femininity through charming, confident, and beautiful women bodies. They combine the different art forms and the different cultures to present an excellent mixture of contemporary art and traditional art.</p>

Gender Unbound is funded in part by a grant by the <a href=""http://www.austintexas.gov/department/cultural-arts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">City of Austin Cultural Arts Division of Economic Development</a>, which requires a us to match a certain percentage of the grant amount. In order to receive a $20,050 grant from the city, <strong>we need to fundraise a match amount of $8,150.</strong></p><p>On average, Gender Unbound Art Fest costs about $35,000 to put on. In addition to fundraising through Indiegogo, we raise revenue through badge sales, advertisements, sponsorships, merchandise sales, and private donations.</p><p>The City of Austin grant will help pay for venue rental, some of our marketing, event staffing, and some of the stipends and travel expenses paid to artists, musicians, and performers. Other elements of the event, like beverages and signage, are sourced through in-kind donations of goods. We need your help to pay for other expenses, including our grant-required match amount of $8,150.</p><p><strong>Our $7,500 funding goal (minus Indiegogo fees of 5%-10%) will pay for:</strong></p><ul>

<li>U-Haul rental for load-in and load-out.</li>
<li>Equipment rentals, including tables, chairs, lighting, audiovisual equipment, and assistive listening devices.</li>

</ul></div>","Gender Unbound Art Fest is a multi-discipline art festival that exclusively features transgender and intersex creators. The festival celebrates the art, music, and performance of an often marginalized community, empowers gender-diverse creators, and educates the general public in a context outside of celebrity coming-out stories or bathroom legislation.The event also connects attendees to much-needed services and organizations.If you are a trans or intersex artist, musician, performer, or filmmaker and would like to participate in the festival, please submit to be considered on our website through April 28th.The 4th annual Gender Unbound Art Fest will take place in Austin, TX on Sept 21-22, 2019 (plus weeknight showcases, dates TBA). We need your help to make Gender Unbound 2019 a success!What We NeedGender Unbound is a nonprofit project that uplifts, supports, and advocates for transgender and intersex communities through arts and programming created by transgender and intersex people. Gender Unbound is funded in part by a grant by the City of Austin Cultural Arts Division of Economic Development, which requires a us to match a certain percentage of the grant amount. In order to receive a $20,050 grant from the city, we need to fundraise a match amount of $8,150.On average, Gender Unbound Art Fest costs about $35,000 to put on. In addition to fundraising through Indiegogo, we raise revenue through badge sales, advertisements, sponsorships, merchandise sales, and private donations.The City of Austin grant will help pay for venue rental, some of our marketing, event staffing, and some of the stipends and travel expenses paid to artists, musicians, and performers. Other elements of the event, like beverages and signage, are sourced through in-kind donations of goods. We need your help to pay for other expenses, including our grant-required match amount of $8,150.Our $7,500 funding goal (minus Indiegogo fees of 5%-10%) will pay for:
The remainder of the venue rental fee.
Event insurance (required by both city and venue contracts).
U-Haul rental for load-in and load-out.
Equipment rentals, including tables, chairs, lighting, audiovisual equipment, and assistive listening devices.
Artist stipends. Many art shows charge application and exhibition fees, but Gender Unbound Art Fest offers a stipend to every featured musician, performer, visual artist, and filmmaker.
Travel stipends for out-of-state artists to assist with transportation and lodging costs.
Printing of materials including tickets, badges, surveys, stickers, posters, and signage.
Event supplies including kraft paper rolls, tape, art hanging supplies, extension cords, 
Contractor stipends paid to the photographer, videographer, sound tech, graphic designer, and other key skilled contractors.
Administrative stipends paid to the stage manager, volunteer coordinator, and other key event organizers.
If we meet our $7,500 goal, any additional funds will help us:
Increase the stipend amounts for all artists, musicians, performers, filmmakers, contractors, and event organizers.
Increase the number and amount of travel stipends available for out-of-state artists.
Bring headliner act--nationally-known musicians and performers--to the event.
Increase the total number of creators featured at the festival.
Fund future events, including future Gender Unbound Art Fests and smaller-scale year-round events like Transgender Day of Visibility, Intersex Awareness Day, and the Gender Unbound Winter Art Market.
Gender Unbound is a nonprofit project. All money stays within the organization to fulfill our mission. Any funds raised beyond the $7,500 goal will help the festival grow sustainably.PerksTo ensure the maximum amount of funding goes towards the festival itself, we have minimized the amount of Indiegogo money that will be used to fulfill perk rewards. Our substantial Indiegogo perks offer high-value items that are already being created for the festival, like festival tickets, shirts, and art.All perks will be delivered digitally or picked up in-person at the festival. This ensures that no Indiegogo funds are used for shipping or handling of perks. If you want to support Gender Unbound but can't make it to Austin for the festival, please consider perks like sponsored tickets or projected ads.$10: One-Day PassGet one advance day pass (Saturday or Sunday) to Gender Unbound 2019 at 33% off the full ticket price of $15.$20: Day Passes for TwoMake it a date night or bring a friend!

<h2>Celebrating Women's History</h2>
<p>Our aim is simple - <strong>include women in the public works of art in the town, in recognition of the significant contribution they have made, and continue to make, to the borough in politics, the arts, business, education, health, social </strong><strong>care</strong><strong> and science.</strong></p>
<p>Despite a wealth of strong, high-achieving women in our history, Bedford numbers not one female statue amongst its 11 existing works of public art. This is a common theme across the country.</p>
<p>2018 marks 100 years since women won the right to vote, celebrated on a national level through the <a href=""https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/vote-100/vote-100-project/vote-100-project-info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vote 100</a> campaign. The timing is perfect for the first statue of one of Bedford's most inspiring women.</p>
<p>We have selected one of the town's most passionate advocates of women's equality -  a strong and enigmatic woman who was head of the local school, a business leader, educationalist, suffragette and politician. <strong>Amy Walmsley</strong> deserves a place amongst the celebrated leaders in the town's history. She will be sculpted by the renowned and experienced Diane Gorvin who has been working with communities for her whole career to bring to life their ambitions. This combination of women is determined to deliver this project for Bedford.</p>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>'Women of Bedford' is a voluntary community group led by three professional women and involving the incredible women of Bedford.   We are working with the Mayor, the council, Bedford's museums including the Higgins, schools and community groups to celebrate the impact women have had on our heritage, and to inform and inspire current and future generations.</p>
<p>We are working across Bedford's community to ensure representation from the diverse population of the town, through education, art and engagement, with the aim of bringing these groups together. Through arts, events and partnership working, we extend our reach across multi-cultural groups, special needs organisations and specialist teams. </p>
<h3>Playing Your Part</h3>
<p>By backing this campaign you will help to increase the visibility of women in our country's heritage - across art, in schools, in written and acknowledged history.</p>
<p>There is a growing recognition of a need to reflect strong women in our country's narrative, yet it remains that <strong>a mere 2.7% of the UK's statues are of historical, non-royal women. </strong></p>
<p>You can make a very real change - this project has already secured permission from the borough council and elected mayor to site the sculpture on The Embankment, a central position of prime importance in the town and a focus for foot and tourist traffic.</p>
<p>All that remains is to raise the funds for artist's fees, casting and installation of the sculpture, and a programme to involve local schools in participating in the creation of the finished piece, offering them a unique opportunity to be involved in a work of public art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The entire project cost is <strong>£100,000.</strong></p>
<p>We want to raise as much as possible through crowdfunding and corporate sponsorship. This is to place ownership in the hands of those who are passionate about reversing the historical trend of making women invisible.</p>
<p><strong>PHASE 1</strong> - We need <strong>£25,000</strong> by the end of January to get the project off the ground. This covers the first instalment for the sculptor to begin her work.</p>
<p>In return, we offer several layers of involvement, depending on how much you want to give. We know that our project has inspired many people - we also know that not everyone can afford to make a big contribution. That's why we have made it easy for everyone to be involved. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>£20</strong> At the start of the project we made a wild guess that, if every woman in the Borough contributed, we would hit the target needed to commission the sculpture. We want to try and make that happen. If you donate £20, you will be included in our Scroll of Supporters, displayed at the unveiling, to proudly show that the sculpture was achieved by the people.</li>
<li>
<strong>£100</strong> - in addition to inclusion on the Scroll of Supporters, you will be invited to attend the unveiling ceremony in December 2018. This will be a key moment in the Vote 100 Campaign, and will involve all local dignitaries, as well as national coverage - and a very cool event!</li>
<li>
<strong>£250</strong> - As well as the above, you will receive an invitation to attend the celebratory reception, with the opportunity to meet the artists, the team involved and the mayor. This is a unique opportunity to become part of a piece of local and national history, recognition of the significance of the suffragette movement and a cool Instagram moment...</li>
<li>
<strong>£1000</strong> - a bespoke supporter package - talk to us!</li>
<li>
<strong>£5000</strong> - ideal for corporate sponsorship, including a permanent plaque at the site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It feels strange to talk about the impact. For most of you who have come this far, you know what this means. Reversing the way history has made women invisible. Recognising the significance of the suffragette movement. Celebrating Bedford's central role in the campaign to create equality for all and revealing ""hidden herstories""!</p>
<p>Bedford has an incredible history. Truly inspirational. There are some exciting, fascinating, powerful stories in our town's history. Uncovering these, sharing them in a substantial way, has the potential to change the way we see ourselves - to recognise the important, hidden people who have created the place we love today. By supporting this project, you will help to make this happen.</p>

<h3>Short Summary (runterscrollen für Deutsch!!)</h3>
<p>OPOTFOTF is a sensational soap opera that will take place at the Hellerau Europäische Zentrum der Künste Dresden in April 2019.  It will be a glorious affair largely closed off to you, the world outside of Dresden.  If you are in Dresden, we feel you owe us both of your eyeballs.  But this is only the tip of the iceberg that is OPOTFOTF.  Hold me Jack, because we are about to crash onto the soft underbelly of the project, laid out for you now in a viewing schedule involving spandex and water shoes. </p>
<p>Things to remember: </p>
<ul>
<li>True nonsense comes from within each and every one of us. </li>
<li>Many things in the world are real.  An infinite number of things are not only not real, but false. </li>
<li>There is no spoon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep it delicate, but ask yourself: when was the last time I put my money towards a caricature of a middle-aged super hero piling his soft underbelly into an iceberg, softly whispering, 'Hold me Jack'?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You... Get?</h3>
<p>We'll beat the dead horse: </p>
<ul>
<li>We want you to give us money because life is absurd.  If we were speaking in mathematical terms, and we are not, no matter how quickly a piece of art approaches absolute nonsense, reality is always faster.  Reality is always more absurd than any piece of theater. </li>
<li>We want you to join us in solidarity in this liminal space between reason, desperation, and defiance.  Fight fire with fire, nonsense with nonsense.  </li>
<li>Besides the spectacle of the century, you will be contributing to the other big part of the project:  this Indiegogo campaign.  All perks will be returned in the form of digital performance art and personalized anarchy, poetic terrorism, and subconscious shockwaves.  Through your donations, we will build an archive of dead manifestos embodied and flattened through smart phones, which you, our co-conspirators, can use as existential salve to soothe the banality of the Every Day Life.  We ask you to give your money willingly to something that cannot be said to have any tangible effect, but is instead more like throwing ice cubes into and against a blizzard.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact (kaboom)</h3>
<p>Look.  We already have some funding.  We know.  We were surprised as well.  With or without your contribution, OPOTFOTF will go forward, and hopefully annoy a certain handful of people here in Dresden while mildly entertaining another.</p>
<ul>
<li>OPOTFOTF will not change anything, except maybe it will. </li>
<li>You are better off contributing to this project if you would like to hear a randomly generated revolutionary cry shouted in a department store, or perhaps hear an elegy for a dead clam.</li>
<li>But you are the best off doing it because you believe in nothing and everything, and this might be a Fun Thing for you to do. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Quite possibly you will like very little of what we produce.  But you must not go tender into this dark line of thought.  Also, the more money you give us, the more likely we are to work with even more qualified artists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who will make more content for the World Wide Web.</li>
<li>Who would be grateful to be compensated for their Artist Work for their Food, Shelter, and Netflix.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't feel like you can contribute monetarily, that's ok. Most of us can't.  Take a look at the perks page and see if there's something you would like to try out yourself.  Do it for the joy of doing it or if you feel like it document your action and send it to us in the form of a video, picture, text, or whatever.  Preferably through the Internet but carrier pigeons accepted.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Don't feel limited to our tasks.  If there is some kind of performative action that has been steadily clawing at the inside of your ribs then let that demon loose. </li>
<li>Or get together as a group and do what you know you need to do.  One's company, but a crowd kills fascists.  (Or becomes them.)</li>

<p>We’re moving out of the 1100 building and could use some help in the transition. All money raised here goes to getting out of our beloved basement and securing a storage space for the flooring, seating, and tech gear so we can keep it safe while we’re in flux.</p>
<p>It costs 40K a year to keep SC going - and in the realm of venues for art that’s hardly anything. If you have a rich uncle that wants a tax write off hit us up, otherwise... please consider donating a few dollars so we can reemerge when it’s possible.</p>
<p>Apologies for the no perks situation. Perhaps the thought of SC existing again in the future is perky enough for now?</p>
<p>We will be selling limited edition SC tshirts:</p>

<p>black with bleach splatter classic SC logo</p>
<p>All proceeds from these sales will also go toward transition/storage space</p>

<p>Earlier this year, All Eyes Wide created an installation together called Gate which opened at the Sound Thought Festival hosted by the Arches in Glasgow. All Eyes Wide is the name given to the collaboration between Glasgow based artists, Edward Crawley and Rob Jones.</p>
<p>Gate I as we now refer to it was very successful but it made us realise there was heaps of potential in our idea and that with a bit more support and more creative development it could be something really amazing and really valuable to our cultural landscape.</p>
<p>Gate II is a playful experiment into sensorial immersion for two audience members at a time. When you arrive at the installation you take your shoes and socks off, are given wireless headphones and blindfolded. You are then paired with another audience member in the exact same position and set free, hand in hand, to explore the installation. As your feet come into contact with different environments and different textures, the soundscape you are hearing through your headphones changes depending on where you are in the room and how you choose to respond.</p>
<p>It’s an investigation into human negotiation and collaboration as well as a means of taking people out of the sensory overload of everyday life, allowing them to feel the subtleties of their senses once again and how these fire our imagination and enliven our spirit.</p>
<p>We found with Gate I that it’s also naturally a very playful experience and can feel like a game being played out between Edward, Rob and the audience as they test the boundaries of the sound geography and how Edward and Rob react to their movements.</p>
<p><strong>What we need and what you get</strong></p>
<p>In order to make the experience as immersive as possible and so that you feel like you’re free to explore a vast landscape, we need some extra support to acquire many of the physical materials you meet in the installation. The ‘stuff’ that makes up the environments you will experience. So that the soundscape can be as dynamic and as responsive as your choice of actions in the space there is certain technical equipment that will make it possible for us to keep up with your movements and responses as they occur in the moment.</p>
<p>Whether we manage to raise these funds or not, Gate II will be realised for Arches Live 2012 but the more we raise the better the journey will be for our audience. The technical equipment we would like, such as high quality head-phones and midi controller, can be used again and again so your support would extend further than this one performance.</p>
<p>As All Eyes Wide, we fully intend to keep developing our immersive, interactive work and hope to tour future Gates, maybe even worldwide if we can. Every penny you contribute will take us closer to this dream and help to bring this new exciting work to a wider audience.</p>

<h2><strong>Thank you to everyone who helped us to meet our goal! If you wish to learn more about how you can be a Working Artist, visit us at WWW.THEWORKINGARTIST.COM</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>It's everything they never taught in art school!</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Crista Cloutier has taught The Working Artist master class to artists and photographers throughout the world. Using what she has learned from her extensive background in the art business as a dealer, publisher, appraiser, curator, gallerist, and artist herself, Crista has a unique understanding of the challenges artists face, and she gives artists the tools they need to create a successful career. Join us in bringing The Working Artist online, as a downloadable program, so any artist, anywhere, can have access to this essential and practical knowledge.</strong></h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The script is written, the artwork is ready, and the class has been taught to hundreds and hundreds of artists and photographers internationally. It works. Your support for The Working Artist will allow us to film and edit this two and a half hour program, and to create the embedded workbook. It will also cover the very groovy incentives we are offering: exclusive interviews with artists who are at the top of their game as they discuss success and their work practices. We are also offering private consultations with Crista, and even artwork by Kiki Smith! Additional funds raised will allow greater production values to make it an even better program, and will also go toward the creation of an online artists' community, bringing working artists the essential opportunity to receive support from one another.</h3>

She helps the artist put into words that what we need to attract buyers. She is sensitive to the artist and the dilemmas that we face, but helps them understand the need to run their art as a business – and she supplies the tools to do that.

It's everything they never taught in art school!
Crista Cloutier has taught The Working Artist master class to artists and photographers throughout the world. Using what she has learned from her extensive background in the art business as a dealer, publisher, appraiser, curator, gallerist, and artist herself, Crista has a unique understanding of the challenges artists face, and she gives artists the tools they need to create a successful career. Join us in bringing The Working Artist online, as a downloadable program, so any artist, anywhere, can have access to this essential and practical knowledge.


The script is written, the artwork is ready, and the class has been taught to hundreds and hundreds of artists and photographers internationally. It works. Your support for The Working Artist will allow us to film and edit this two and a half hour program, and to create the embedded workbook. It will also cover the very groovy incentives we are offering: exclusive interviews with artists who are at the top of their game as they discuss success and their work practices. We are also offering private consultations with Crista, and even artwork by Kiki Smith! Additional funds raised will allow greater production values to make it an even better program, and will also go toward the creation of an online artists' community, bringing working artists the essential opportunity to receive support from one another.

""Good business is the best art."" Andy Warhol


""I found the workshop powerful and not at all what I had imagined."" Deborah Phillips, Artist, London
""This class was worth every penny - really, priceless."" Taunya van der Steen-Mizel, New York
""Crista, you truly are 'The Artist Whisperer."" Benn Abdy-Collins, London
""Such stunning advice..."" Heidi Benn, Capetown
""95% of the artists I know should take this class."" James Robischon, Robischin gallery, Denver
""Crista is the most knowledgeable person in the art world that I know. In the workshop she ties together the artist, the marketing, and the buyer. She helps the artist put into words that what we need to attract buyers. She is sensitive to the artist and the dilemmas that we face, but helps them understand the need to run their art as a business – and she supplies the tools to do that. Crista will turn your art practice into a more profitable business and help you to be a better artist because of the questions she asks and the goals that she helps you to create for yourself."" Kent Corbin, Artist, Scottsdale

<p>The restaurant was their only means of support for our education. It started well, but<br/>soon buckled under the ever-failing economy. But we were doing ok. Back then, life was very simple, and I dreamed that I would become an artist who spoke ﬂuent French. I don’t know why I chose this.</p>
<p>My parents worked very hard to put me through some of the best schools in Ghana.<br/>They even dared to push us out to the States, where they supported my studies at<br/>Mount Holyoke College. I’m blessed: only 5% of Ghanaians achieve higher education.<br/>Most Ghanaian families can’t afford even basic education, and some kids don’t even<br/>survive their ﬁrst bout of malaria.</p>
<p>This is how I left Ghana: my dad walked me to the airport entrance, hugged me and<br/>then watched me leave. I must have been 18 or so. Everything changed in that moment. I didn’t realize that a chunk of my adulthood was going to be spent apart from the people who worked so hard to push me this far.</p>
<p>It was very daring of me to double major in French and Studio Art rather than a more<br/>‘useful’ area of study. My decision was met with a lot of opposition. I still remember<br/>hearing things like “African students don’t come to the US to study Art,” and “Art is a<br/>waste of time - what are you going to do with the rest of your life?” It also meant that,unlike most of my African peers who end up on Wall Street, I wasn’t going to be<br/>guaranteed success in the US. This didn’t deter me though.</p>
<p>Art and French at MHC opened up so many opportunities. After studying in Montpelier, I now speak French ﬂuently. I also wrote a thesis and had my portraits displayed in an exhibition. This year I was accepted into the Parsons Paris School of Design for Visual Communications and awarded $14,748 (€12,000) in scholarships.</p>
<p>This program is going to be my launchpad. I have $16,716 (€13,600) left to cover after my scholarship. My aim is to raise half this amount, then support myself by working while I study. I’m in ﬁnal interviews for a job in Paris. If you can help me raise $9,190 (€6,800), I will be able to afford the monthly tuition plan and make more art.</p>
<p>If you are unable to donate monetarily, please share my story. Supporting my efforts at Parsons means supporting a rare African woman with the desire to bless you with her he[art].

<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I'm Crystal Minnerick, a senior at Western Michigan University currently working towards a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design. This campaign will support my first study abroad experience! We will be traveling to Venice, Florence, <span>Cornuda</span>, and Vernoa in Italy to study art history, book arts, and typography. The class will run from May 16 – June 8.</p>
<p>As a graphic designer, I've always had a strong interest in art and typography. Going to Italy (which has some of the most important art of the Renaissance) will be a dream come true. </p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Not only will we be visiting historic libraries, sites, and mueseums, but we will also have a rare opportunity to work in<span><span> the historic book arts facilities at the Scuola di Grafica Internazionale in Venice (<a href=""http://www.scuolagrafica.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.scuolagrafica.it</a>), Firenze Arti Visive in Florence (<a href=""http://www.firenze-artivisive.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.firenze-artivisive.org</a>), and Tipoteca Italiana Fondazione in Cornuda (<a href=""http://www.tipoteca.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tipoteca.it</a>).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We will create a limited-edition book written and illustrated by the members of the class, containing intaglio images, text printed on antique presses using movable type, and hand bookbinding.</span></span></p>

<h2>Your Contributions</h2>
<p>The program fee for this Study Abroad trip is $4,300 and the airfare will be around $1500, so all of the proceeds from this campaign will go to cover those costs.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>I understand that money is hard to come by, so I want to share my experience with the people who help make this trip happen. I'm offering beautiful photo wallpapers, prints, and books that incorporate entries from my daily journal so that contributers can have a personal reminder of the experience that would be impossible without their donations.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This study abroad trip will be a dream come true. It will help me be a more educated and cultured student. It will also enhance the repertoire of my portfolio, making me a more desireable employee.</p>
<p>Our daily journals, intaglio prints, and completed letterpress publication will be part of an exhibition in the fall of 2013 at the Kalamazoo Book Arts Center (in Kalamazoo, MI) to share the students' experience with the community. Please be sure to come see it!</p>

<p><em><strong>To you our donors, who have supported us once again for the Burning Man installation, our apologies for this late notice on pdropping the project. Due to unforseen circumstances we are unable to attend Burning Man for the amount of time which such a project requires. But, we will be back - hopefully next year.</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is our third Burning Man art installation marrying social commentary, spiritual pursuit, art and fire.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br/>How Crate Thou Art is a fun house built inside a two story space designed to look like stacked wooden cargo crates. An 8' cube placed atop a 12' cube forms the fun house space.</p>
<p>Participants will be challenged on issues of self discovery. Illusions such as the famous ""Ames Room"", a scavenger hunt for your self image, and discovery of the key to your enemy's heart will turn the concept of seeking self fulfillment upside down.</p>
<p>Once on top of the installation a person will face their own dreams and sense of destiny with a new perspective on life.</p>
<p><strong>THE NAME</strong><br/>""How Crate Thou Art"" is a play on words from the famous hymn ""How Great Thou Art."" A self absorbed search for self discovery often leads to stunted and limited growth. We become boxed inside ourselves by searching into the limited landscape of our own inner life. How Crate Thou Art challenges self discovery without the outside resources of sacrificial love toward others, or lessons from God.</p>
<p>Part of the lesson from How Crate Thou Art will include considering the question, ""What if your life were cntained in a box?"" This is a challenge to our capitalistic culture.</p>
<p><strong>MATERIALS</strong><br/>This is an almost entirely wooden project, which will be burned following the display. Yes, burned. We love burning our projects to the ground. It is Burning Man after all, and that's what people do. Wood costs a lot these days, and so most of the cost goes to purchasing the stuff to build with. We have lighting, and art supplies from the last two years of Burning Man projects to help create the funhouse elements inside the two story structure.</p>
<p><strong>OUR SUCCESS</strong><br/>Our story was told in a feature article in Christianity Today in the July/August edition 2012. All supporters will receive the full color photo pdf of that article. The less artistic version can be found online <a href=""http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/july-august/finding-jesus-at-burning-man.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>

We have been organizing the project since January and will be painting the murals in the last week of March and the first week of April. <br/><br/>This amount covers our costs <br/>travel - $300<br/>supplies $200<br/>Indiegogo rewards $200<br/>Lily's time: organizing the walls with the schools, talking with the Chamber of Commerce, communicating with students and teachers, painting $700<br/>Alex's time: designing the murals, developing the project idea, facilitating students painting, and painting the murals $1200<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Imagine the words ""You Are Loved,"" as the
substance of a mural - the letters, 12 feet tall, covering the side of a public
school in your community. Imagine the words ""You Can Do It,"" painted,
not just as a sign, but made artfully, beautifully, causing community members
to stop and look, moved by the beauty of the painting, internalizing the power
of the message. Imagine the internal conversations it will cause when people
read ""You Are Needed"" emblazoned on a public wall, undercutting all the
voices that fill our public spaces, the internet, and public thought testifying
to the opposite. You can make this happen. </p>
<p>Imagine the young woman, struggling with fears about her
appearance, drinking in a confident, colorful mural declaring ""You Are
Beautiful"" instead of the belittling message of sex-based advertising.
Imagine a young man struggling to find work encountering an unequivocal public statement
that ""You Are Needed."" Such bold expressions will cause people to
think and feel in new and more hopeful ways. Many will simply see the beauty,
feel the message, and be uplifted and renewed.</p>

What We Need & What You GetWe are working to raise $2500 to pay for the creation of these 2 murals. We have been organizing the project since January and will be painting the murals in the last week of March and the first week of April. This amount covers our costs travel - $300supplies $200Indiegogo rewards $200Lily's time: organizing the walls with the schools, talking with the Chamber of Commerce, communicating with students and teachers, painting $700Alex's time: designing the murals, developing the project idea, facilitating students painting, and painting the murals $1200The Impact
Imagine the words ""You Are Loved,"" as the
substance of a mural - the letters, 12 feet tall, covering the side of a public
school in your community. Imagine the words ""You Can Do It,"" painted,
not just as a sign, but made artfully, beautifully, causing community members
to stop and look, moved by the beauty of the painting, internalizing the power
of the message. Imagine the internal conversations it will cause when people
read ""You Are Needed"" emblazoned on a public wall, undercutting all the
voices that fill our public spaces, the internet, and public thought testifying
to the opposite. You can make this happen. 
Imagine the young woman, struggling with fears about her
appearance, drinking in a confident, colorful mural declaring ""You Are
Beautiful"" instead of the belittling message of sex-based advertising.
Imagine a young man struggling to find work encountering an unequivocal public statement
that ""You Are Needed."" Such bold expressions will cause people to
think and feel in new and more hopeful ways. Many will simply see the beauty,
feel the message, and be uplifted and renewed.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are two creatives from Vancouver BC going on a trip to further our careers, expand our networks and share our talents with new audiences. On April 1st we depart from Vancouver headed towards Europe where we will spend 2 weeks in Amsterdam and Barcelona painting, playing music and connecting with local artists. From there we will head south to Cape Town, South Africa where we will be staying at the A Word Of Art Residency program headquarters ( <a href=""http://www.a-word-of-art.co.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.a-word-of-art.co.za/</a> ). We will spend 3 weeks in Cape Town where SUEME will be painting murals and also creating a series of paintings for an upcoming show at the AWOA facility. Meanwhile, BIKES will be playing some gigs in Cape Town and most importantly at Afrika Burn, a 5 day community-based art/music festival that takes place in the South African desert.</p>

<p>In addition to the trip itself, and one of the main reasons for the fundraising, is that we would like to document our trip and make a series of videos to share our experiences (similar to the one we did for our recent trip to Miami for Art Basel, see here: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/34690945"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://vimeo.com/34690945</a> ). Because we are traveling to so many new places far from home, we think it's really important to document our journey to be able to share our exploits with friends, family, fans &amp; sponsors. We don't currently own a camera that shoots video, so that is a rather large expense for us in addition to all of the regular travel costs.</p>

We are two creatives from Vancouver BC going on a trip to further our careers, expand our networks and share our talents with new audiences. On April 1st we depart from Vancouver headed towards Europe where we will spend 2 weeks in Amsterdam and Barcelona painting, playing music and connecting with local artists. From there we will head south to Cape Town, South Africa where we will be staying at the A Word Of Art Residency program headquarters ( http://www.a-word-of-art.co.za/ ). We will spend 3 weeks in Cape Town where SUEME will be painting murals and also creating a series of paintings for an upcoming show at the AWOA facility. Meanwhile, BIKES will be playing some gigs in Cape Town and most importantly at Afrika Burn, a 5 day community-based art/music festival that takes place in the South African desert.

In addition to the trip itself, and one of the main reasons for the fundraising, is that we would like to document our trip and make a series of videos to share our experiences (similar to the one we did for our recent trip to Miami for Art Basel, see here: http://vimeo.com/34690945 ). Because we are traveling to so many new places far from home, we think it's really important to document our journey to be able to share our exploits with friends, family, fans & sponsors.

<h3>A little about me and my work</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.diannesmithart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dianne Smith</a>. I am a painter, sculptor, installation artist, and cultural worker. I was born and raised in the Bronx, and I now live and work out of my home studio in Central Harlem. </p>
<p>I use materials in my immediate surroundings to make assemblages. The items I use are things that would ordinarily end up in the trash. My sculptural assemblages are not limited to one particular material as I am using what I have. They are multi-textured and layered with cloth, clothing, hangers, wires, strings, rope, cardboard, dirt, wax, butcher paper and so forth. The assemblages consist of wall hangings, reliefs and stand alone sculptures that may be wrapped and twisted with string, twine and rope.</p>
<p>These (otherwise) discarded materials are part of my inner dialogue--a metaphor for how I view the world. Identity: race, gender, religion, inequity and consumption in a global climate filled with economic despair are all interrelated. Yet, my personhood defines my relationship with each one. Just as it defines the relationship I have with the items I use in my sculptures.</p>
<p>My process is at once organic and incremental. Even as a painter I am not the type of artist that usually creates from a planned paradigm. My forms and shapes are based on the sum of my lived experiences culturally, spiritually and socially. My approach and process is to allow things to unfold, which is also my process when constructing site specific installation out of butcher paper.</p>

<p><strong>The Project and Installations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Installation Dates: </strong>March 4, 2013 to March 24, 2013</p>
<p><strong>‘<em>Organic Abstracts</em>’</strong> is an exhibition by the <a href=""http://looselycoupledexhibition.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">West Harlem Art Fund</a> in partnership with the <a href=""http://www.bartowpellmansionmuseum.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum</a> and the City of New York Parks &amp; Recreation department for <a href=""http://www.thearmoryshow.com/armory_arts_week/2013.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Armory Week 2013</a>.  </p>
<p>The installation, comprised of two sculptures, showcases a minimalist approach to abstract art, scaled large and reminiscent of works by Henry Moore, who incorporated them into the local landscape and was heavily influenced by non-Western art. The works will not be made from traditional wood or metal but from repurposed materials, offering a more direct and intimate experience for the artist. Viewers will be able to discover the sculptures on the grounds of the Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum, part of the Historic House Trust of NYC. The history of the site,  located in the north Bronx, predates the American Revolution. Located in the city’s largest park, the site was also selected because it is near a wildlife sanctuary, trails, and Orchard Beach. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bartowpellmansionmuseum.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bartowpellmansionmuseum.org</a></p>
<p><strong><em>The Couple </em></strong>consists of two heads approximately twenty feet wide and ten feet tall at the highest point resting on one another securely onto a rectangular base. Just as my sculptures, they will be made from everyday discarded materials, like packaging, paper, cans, clothing, magazines, etc. These items will be tightly bound together with string and rope.</p>
<p>The materials and it connectors will create a colorful and textural work of art that will engage the viewer. <em>The Couple</em> represents the idea of environmental, community, and family respect. The idea of heads resting on one another plays on the old adages “<em>two heads are better than one”</em> and  “<em>it takes a village.”</em> They symbolize the thought that we need each other and the environment to live harmonious and balanced lives.Using these objects and connectors allows the viewer to interact with the materials.</p>
<p>For instance, the objects will be visible through the rope and string, thus the viewer will be able to identify things from their everyday life. Allowing the viewer a more personal connection to the sculpture. Sculpting with everyday objects is similar to life: there is no sure thing--something useful one moment is discarded the next. These materials speak to the fragile balance that exists in day-to-day existence, and nature. Thus, it is important to respect, support, and love our communities, families, and environment.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/639358/pictures/full/20130129202940-IMG_1661.JPG?1359520185"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Flying High </em></strong>is a site-specific installation constructed out of brown butcher paper. The paper may be crunched, crumpled, rolled, twisted, interlocked, woven, and manipulated and will hang between two trees. Its formations and sunlight will create patterns of shadows, as well as contrast of light and dark, and it will be weather proofed.</p>
<p>Butcher paper for me is a metaphor for the treatment of people in developing countries, particularly those of African descent. It is used for many things and tossed away once we are done. Wrapping meat, crafts, shipping and packing materials are just some of its uses. When we pack things we often push them down, bunching the paper to fill corners, trying to get everything tightly secured and contained. It symbolizes consumption in a global market.</p>
<p><em>Flying High</em> is also meant to question our ancestral, historical, cultural, and political past, as well as the possibilities for our future. I'd like the viewer to look at the wrinkles in the paper, think about the wrinkles in the skin of the elders in their families: What stories do they tell? What memories do they hold? Look at the ways in which the paper intertwines: How are you connected to your ancestral legacy? Look at the shadows the paper casts: What are your hidden truths? What is the imprint of your personhood on humanity and the environment?</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Art is the epoxy that holds a culture together.</p>
<p><strong>Why a public art installation at Bartow-Pell Mansion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bronx i</strong>s not often thought of as a pastoral place with much natural beauty. Yet, it was once filled with many country estates such as the Bartow-Pell Mansion. By bridging contemporary art, and the rich history of Bartow-Pell Mansion, I want the local community and other visitors to rediscover the spirit and elegance of its natural landscape. The Bronx is also home to many ethnic groups to whom nature is very important. This installation hopes to link the varied cultures, antecedents and Bartow-Pell Mansion’s past to the present, as well as its future in a manner not seen before. Thus creating a lasting imprint on how we all view such a historical site.</p>
<p>I am honored (and I must confess partly terrified) to have been given such a monumental task!</p>

<p><strong>About this project...<br/></strong></p>
<p>As part of a multi-disciplinary project that I have been working on for more than a year, <a href=""http://stonemandy.wordpress.com/about/about-the-solstenen-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">‘Solstenen Project’,</a> I am heading to the Western region of Iceland for 5 weeks to do a series of remote artist residencies, with my family -- artist Paul Margolis and our son Hazel Margolis -- where we will all three be working on developing performance-based videos, photography and environmental interventions/installations.  This project is about putting myself as an artist in a radically different place than my comfort zones, using my own body and our private family culture as medium, blending our roles as artists, parents and partners. </p>
<p><strong>How does Saskia’s contribution come into play?</strong></p>
<p>Thoughout the process of developing this project, I have sought out <strong>mentors</strong> in other fields to push my work into new territories, into movement/performance, into video/media, writing and sound work.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to get to know Saskia’s multi-faceted work early in this process when I invited her to join me in a roundtable discussion on <a href=""http://stonemandy.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/guest-artists-profile-artists-who-interview-joey-veltkamp-tessa-hulls-amanda-manitach-sharon-arnold-and-saskia-delores/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Artists who Interview” </a>when I did an open studio residency at Seattle art center The Project Room for the Solstenen project, to discuss her <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/ShutUpDreamCrusher?feature=watch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Shut Up Dream Crusher"" documentary project</a>. </p>
<p>I also became inspired by her work as a sound and video artist, her ability to transform simple media tools into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL8YCBZ90f8&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lush soundscapes</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc_UcH7-OF4&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">visually intoxicating films</a>.  <strong>The main thrust of  Saskia’s artwork is an exploration of where people fail or succeed with the creative process and translating that for all kinds of people.  She is on a mission to encourage the creative efforts of artists (and everyone), to overcome the things that block your growth. </strong>  She has been a true mentor in encouraging my movement towards video/sound work.</p>
<p>This spring when I was commissioned by the City of Seattle to create and installation and multi-media performance piece, I immediately asked Saskia to join the team of collaborators.  <a href=""http://matermatrixmother.wordpress.com/2012/06/20/saltus-chori-aevum-performance-images-may-5-and-6th-2012/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Saltus Chori Aevum”</a> was a lush and beautiful success, in no small part to Saskia’s contributions to the score and haunting portarl of “the cutter”. As creative director, working at her side on the sound design, I was incredibly inspired by her desire to show me the ropes of creating sound pieces not unlike the way I build environments. </p>
<p>I also found my movement practice for the performance piece was so connected to the layered worlds of sound she creates.  Her sound work was like a partner, a guide for developing new ways for me to express my concepts with the movement of my body.</p>
<p><strong>To Iceland!</strong></p>
<p>Saskia and my collaboration on <a href=""http://mandygreer.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/saltus-chori-aevum-performance-this-past-spring-upcoming-film/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Saltus Chori Aevum”</a>  was such a period of growth for my plans for what I hoped to accomplish in Iceland with Paul and Hazel.  I knew I wanted to continue to work with Saskia’s sound work in conjunction with the performance work in Iceland; it just seems <strong>imperative to the authenticy of the work that she make some of that sound work in Iceland.</strong></p>

<div>And thank you for helping make artist-initiated creative works possible!</div></div>","I’m raising funds to cover the travel expenses to Iceland for an incredible performance/sound artist/documentarian Saskia Delores;  to support  a collaborative process between Saskia and myself and my family while we do a series of artist residencies. 
About this project...
As part of a multi-disciplinary project that I have been working on for more than a year, ‘Solstenen Project’, I am heading to the Western region of Iceland for 5 weeks to do a series of remote artist residencies, with my family -- artist Paul Margolis and our son Hazel Margolis -- where we will all three be working on developing performance-based videos, photography and environmental interventions/installations.  This project is about putting myself as an artist in a radically different place than my comfort zones, using my own body and our private family culture as medium, blending our roles as artists, parents and partners. 
How does Saskia’s contribution come into play?
Thoughout the process of developing this project, I have sought out mentors in other fields to push my work into new territories, into movement/performance, into video/media, writing and sound work.
I had the opportunity to get to know Saskia’s multi-faceted work early in this process when I invited her to join me in a roundtable discussion on “Artists who Interview” when I did an open studio residency at Seattle art center The Project Room for the Solstenen project, to discuss her “Shut Up Dream Crusher"" documentary project. 
I also became inspired by her work as a sound and video artist, her ability to transform simple media tools into lush soundscapes and visually intoxicating films.  The main thrust of  Saskia’s artwork is an exploration of where people fail or succeed with the creative process and translating that for all kinds of people.  She is on a mission to encourage the creative efforts of artists (and everyone), to overcome the things that block your growth.   She has been a true mentor in encouraging my movement towards video/sound work.
This spring when I was commissioned by the City of Seattle to create and installation and multi-media performance piece, I immediately asked Saskia to join the team of collaborators.  “Saltus Chori Aevum” was a lush and beautiful success, in no small part to Saskia’s contributions to the score and haunting portarl of “the cutter”. As creative director, working at her side on the sound design, I was incredibly inspired by her desire to show me the ropes of creating sound pieces not unlike the way I build environments. 
I also found my movement practice for the performance piece was so connected to the layered worlds of sound she creates.  Her sound work was like a partner, a guide for developing new ways for me to express my concepts with the movement of my body.
To Iceland!
Saskia and my collaboration on “Saltus Chori Aevum”  was such a period of growth for my plans for what I hoped to accomplish in Iceland with Paul and Hazel.  I knew I wanted to continue to work with Saskia’s sound work in conjunction with the performance work in Iceland; it just seems imperative to the authenticy of the work that she make some of that sound work in Iceland.
When I found out that one of the sites of my residencies had a third bedroom that I wouldn’t need as a studio, it seemed like a golden opportunity to provide that space to another artist, to Saskia. 
We all decided to have faith that we could make this happen on such short notice.  We believe that the people who support our work, believe in what we have done and will continue to do, will support our efforts to make this collaborative process  happen!  With both of us reaching out to all of our supporters, we feel we can make this happen with a collection of very small donations from all of you! 
So we hope your belief or interest in our work will be worth it to you and you will join us to help make this happen!  Even a $2 donation let’s us know you are cheering us on!
You’ll be supporting not just one artist’s project but two!
Saskia plans to make the most of the two weeks she will be joining us!  In addition to working with me to create some of the soundscapes for our films, she also plans to continue in the vein of the “Shut Up Dream Crusher” episode she created about Paul and me (watch above), by create documentary footage of my family as we work on our project, showing the creative process in daily life in a family setting when the parents are artists.
She’ll also have 4 days in Reykjavik alone  and is making plans on meeting Icelandic artists and regular folk and film them talking about their life, dreams, aspirations to continue the “Shutup Dream Crusher” project on an international scale.  And she will continue her experimental street  music and art performance in Iceland, documenting  those performances to be available for online distribution later.
 What you will be helping us pay for!
It is daunting when nearly every book and website about Iceland begins by describing how expensive it is!  But we have a specific goal to meet the budget for transportation costs so they don’t stay on my credit card building interest.  Then we hope you'll help us surpass our goal and give Saskia the ability to focus on working by helping her cover her additional expenses. 
During two weeks, Saskia will be traveling  from Reykjavik to Snaefellsnes peninsula,  to Fljotstunga Farm artist residency, to a night in Hvalfjordur and back to Reykjavik.
This is the breakdown of what you will be supporting by helping us meet our fundraising goals:
airfare  = $1022
rental car costs = $900
donor prizes cost=$100
Fundraising transportation goal is $2022
BUT consider helping us surpass our Goal and help fund Saskia’s expenses, for a total of $2682.  Anything above that will go to fund her time completing her documentary projects.
These are her additional expenses:
$45 bus from Keflavik Airport to Reykjavik
$65 bus from Reykjavik to Snaefellsnes
$50 gas cost from Fljotstunga to Reykjavik
$500, help Saskia live and eat in one of the priciest places to visit!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Hey everyone. My name is Kyle Laskiewicz and I'm using IndieGogo for something that's really personal to me. Something that I've wanted to do for some time but haven't because of my money situation. First off I'd like to ask for just $1 from any person who reads this. Something small since I know I'm not the only one hard up for money. Thank you.</p>
<p>In October of 2012 I lost my mom. An amazing woman who left behind myself, her husband, and 10 year old son. She had been battling leukemia and kicked it's ass, eventually going into remission. But if you have ever had to deal with cancer or a loved one getting it (I hope none of you have to go through it) then you know how bad the chemo can be more than anything else. And well that's how it ended for her.</p>
<p>I still remember the day like it was yesterday. I was actually at New York Comic Con and called her to ask about going to dinner than night with my girlfriend and I. She sounded sick and said, ""no mommy isn't feeling good"" in the weirdest way. I knew she was home with my brother (granted he is only 10) and my grandparents live right down the street, so I wasn't that worried. I just thought she had a cold or something since she hadn't looked weak at all recently.</p>
<p>Well with her immune system down from the chemo she went into shock. By the time I got home that night it was too late. We went to the hospital but we lost her that night. Since then nothing has felt right.</p>
<p>Anyway right after she passed away my Pop (her father) got a tattoo of a cross with her name and a son he lost. My immediate plan was to get something for her. I only have one tattoo, but that's just a design with lyrics. Nothing for her. I got it years before. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I couldn't afford to get a tattoo in her memory. This past year has thrown my family and I curve balls that seem to come at the worst time. But when talking about money I've had bad luck and bills. I'm a broke college kid. I do have a part time job but I have car insurance, a phone bill, and need to pay for gas since I commute. I also had to give up a decent amount of money because during Hurricane Sandy I lost my car. It completely flooded out and got washed away. It's just a car and I didn't get upset since my perspective on life changed greatly after my mom died. It sucked losing it, but it's just a position. I'm just glad she didn't have to go through the pain we all felt after Sandy. She passed away a week or so before it. I forget exactly when Sandy hit.<br/></p>
<p>So it's coming up on the one year anniversary of her death and it hasn't gotten any easier. From her picture in my wallet, to her ashes in a cross around my neck, I always have things to remind me of her. But from the beginning I've wanted to get something more visible to always have on me. Pictures and necklaces can break/get lost. Ink will fade but the image won't. The memory won't.</p>
<p>I feel like now is the perfect time to get something for her. IndieGogo makes me put a minimum of $500 but I don't need that much. If anyone that reads this just throws me $1 then I hope I can get at least $300 to afford something special. </p>
<p>What do I want? Well one of my best memories of her is growing up and spending so much time playing Super Mario games. I grew up with the NES/SNES and she used to love playing Super Mario Bros. 3 more than anything. We used to take turns and it was just something so special that I'll never forget it. When my brother got a Wii she did the same thing. She truly loved us...but she loved SMB more I think haha.</p>
<p>I don't simply want an orange ribbon for leukemia. No, I want the cover of Super Mario Bros. 3 (Mario flying in a Tanooki suit) with an orange ribbon flowing from his body. I feel like it's unique enough where it's special between just us, and it always represents what she had to go through. The struggle and fight she put up with. <br/><br/>I somehow want to incorporate lyrics and a possibly a totally different design related to the band Four Year Strong's song ""One Step At A Time."" The song is about one of the vocalists Dan losing his brother to leukemia. They've been a band who has resonated with me for a decade now, growing up going to shows and what not. The lyrics really hit home for me and I do want to incorporate them somehow. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/fouryearstrong/onestepatatime.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here</a> are the lyrics for the song, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DscQuPvZX54"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> is the song itself. The lyrics I want are:<br/></p>
<p>""No matter how far the view, I still always look up to you.""</p>
<p>This is something I <b>need </b>to do. I miss her every second of every day. It was hard just typing this all. Such a rush of emotions from feeling happy and thinking of good times, to not being able to forget that those times are gone.</p>
<p>So please if you could donate something as small as possible it would help. Like I said, she passed away in late October. It's really hitting me hard more than ever knowing that it's been a full year since I haven't had the most amazing woman in my life. I need to do this to honor her. To remember her. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading this all. Even if you don't want to contribute to me then please at least look into funding cancer research. My mother dealt with <a href=""http://www.lls.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a> so at least give them some help if you don't want to give me anything. I guess I'm just glad that you read my stories and memories of her. Thank you again.</p></span></div>","Hey everyone.

<p><b>Weeping Cedar Woman </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>""Tears
streaming from her eyes represent the sorrow she feels at the destruction. The
right hand is upheld, to say, 'Stop!' Her left hand points to the Earth, ‘consider
nature’.""</i></p>
<p>Godfrey Stephens was
inspired to carve the ""Weeping Cedar Woman"" in 1984 to aid the
protest against logging the ancient rain-forests of Meares Island in Clayoquot
Sound.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Carved from a 300 year
old wind fall western red cedar from Meares Island, the body and tears are of
one piece, hands and feet carved separately and mortised.</p>
<p>After the
Meares Island logging protests, the statue was moved to Strawberry Island, where
the carving stood for 16 years facing the town of Tofino, B.C.<br/></p><p>Historically, politically and
culturally significant, Weeping Cedar Woman belongs in Clayoquot Sound. The Tla-o-qui-aht tribal parks have stopped clear-cut logging, considered nature, and offer us a new way forwards!  Lets bring Weeping Cedar Woman home for the 30th anniversary of the tribal park and the logging blockade.  <br/></p>
<p>Individuals and community organizations
from Clayoquot Sound are collaborating to bring her home.  The
objective is to dedicate the statue on the actual 30th anniversary of the Wah-Nah-Jus/Hilth-hoo-is (Meares Island) Tribal Park declaration, Easter Sunday, April 20th,
2014. This will also mark the start of Earth Week, a celebration with events
across the region.  </p>
<p>Weeping Cedar Woman homecoming is a
project endorsed by many groups from the Tofino community.<span>  The District of Tofino is supporting
this project in important ways, but the money required to purchase the piece
from the artist will have to be raised independently.  Only with your help can we bring this conservation icon to
Tofino so she can continue to share her wisdom and story.  <br/></span></p>
<p><b>The
Artist:</b></p>
<p>Godfrey Stephens is an original and
well respected artist from Vancouver Island.<span>  His works are found in many countries, collections and
public places, including two monumental carved cedar pieces in the Victoria
Press Building.  Parks Canada
commissioned him to make a small sculpture, which he presented to Princess Anne
when she dedicated Pacific Rim National Park Reserve in May 1971.  He lived and worked in the Tofino /
Long Beach area for many years before moving to Victoria and Salt Spring.</span></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p>
<p>The District of Tofino is looking to
provide a permanent home for Weeping Cedar Woman, but a lot still needs to be
done to bring Cedar Woman home.<span> Other community groups including Tofino Arts Council and the
Pacific Rim Arts Society have agreed to help find funding for signage and dedication costs, but this leaves the acquisition cost to be
fundraised. Before launching this campaign roughly 4,000$ of the 20,000$ price tag has already been
donated by the community.  Funds raised above and beyond the acquisition costs will be donated to the artist to help with his current major piece called NevermoreWar, a sculpture integrating retired military
equipment into a plough share.</span></p>
<p>As thank you’s the community has come
together to offer some perks:</p>
<p>20$ - Signed cards featuring local art or photography</p><p>50$ - A Sea Wench travel pack<br/></p>
<p>75$ - A 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Meares Island t-shirt
from FOCS</p>
<p>125$ - A print photo of “Eagle” by Tofino Photography</p>
<p>250$ - A print of one of artist Godfrey Stephen's pieces</p><p>400$ - A signed 10""-12"" print of one of artist Godfrey Stephen's pieces<br/></p>
<p>1000$ a 100$ Gift Certificate to dinner at Sobo’s; an authentic

</h3><p>Here are a couple testemonials of the power of the Weeping Cedar Woman, take a look at<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/godfreystephensweepingcedarwoman"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> facebook</a> for more of her significance!</p><p>
</p><h5>
<span>""Come on Canada….Get this
amazing piece of West Coast history back to the home where it belongs. Long
before Tofino was hip slick and cool..before there was a ""Park"" and
before the tourists took over Godfrey was on the beach at Wreck Bay
carving,drawing and painting and his art and history is an important part of
Tofinos story . Weeping Cedar Woman is a cornerstone for that history.Bring it
back along with the tribute to Godfrey's amazing life and connection to the
area.""

""Tears
streaming from her eyes represent the sorrow she feels at the destruction. The
right hand is upheld, to say, 'Stop!' Her left hand points to the Earth, ‘consider
nature’.""
Godfrey Stephens was
inspired to carve the ""Weeping Cedar Woman"" in 1984 to aid the
protest against logging the ancient rain-forests of Meares Island in Clayoquot
Sound.  
Carved from a 300 year
old wind fall western red cedar from Meares Island, the body and tears are of
one piece, hands and feet carved separately and mortised.
After the
Meares Island logging protests, the statue was moved to Strawberry Island, where
the carving stood for 16 years facing the town of Tofino, B.C.Historically, politically and
culturally significant, Weeping Cedar Woman belongs in Clayoquot Sound. The Tla-o-qui-aht tribal parks have stopped clear-cut logging, considered nature, and offer us a new way forwards!  Lets bring Weeping Cedar Woman home for the 30th anniversary of the tribal park and the logging blockade.  
Individuals and community organizations
from Clayoquot Sound are collaborating to bring her home.  The
objective is to dedicate the statue on the actual 30th anniversary of the Wah-Nah-Jus/Hilth-hoo-is (Meares Island) Tribal Park declaration, Easter Sunday, April 20th,
2014. This will also mark the start of Earth Week, a celebration with events
across the region.  
Weeping Cedar Woman homecoming is a
project endorsed by many groups from the Tofino community.  The District of Tofino is supporting
this project in important ways, but the money required to purchase the piece
from the artist will have to be raised independently.  Only with your help can we bring this conservation icon to
Tofino so she can continue to share her wisdom and story.  
The
Artist:
Godfrey Stephens is an original and
well respected artist from Vancouver Island.  His works are found in many countries, collections and
public places, including two monumental carved cedar pieces in the Victoria
Press Building.  Parks Canada
commissioned him to make a small sculpture, which he presented to Princess Anne
when she dedicated Pacific Rim National Park Reserve in May 1971.  He lived and worked in the Tofino /
Long Beach area for many years before moving to Victoria and Salt Spring.
What We Need & What You Get
The District of Tofino is looking to
provide a permanent home for Weeping Cedar Woman, but a lot still needs to be
done to bring Cedar Woman home. Other community groups including Tofino Arts Council and the
Pacific Rim Arts Society have agreed to help find funding for signage and dedication costs, but this leaves the acquisition cost to be
fundraised. Before launching this campaign roughly 4,000$ of the 20,000$ price tag has already been
donated by the community.  Funds raised above and beyond the acquisition costs will be donated to the artist to help with his current major piece called NevermoreWar, a sculpture integrating retired military
equipment into a plough share.
As thank you’s the community has come
together to offer some perks:
20$ - Signed cards featuring local art or photography50$ - A Sea Wench travel pack
75$ - A 30th anniversary of Meares Island t-shirt
from FOCS
125$ - A print photo of “Eagle” by Tofino Photography
250$ - A print of one of artist Godfrey Stephen's pieces400$ - A signed 10""-12"" print of one of artist Godfrey Stephen's pieces
1000$ a 100$ Gift Certificate to dinner at Sobo’s; an authentic
Tofitian dinning experience
The importance of Weeping Cedar Woman
Here are a couple testemonials of the power of the Weeping Cedar Woman, take a look at facebook for more of her significance!

""Come on Canada….Get this
amazing piece of West Coast history back to the home where it belongs. Long
before Tofino was hip slick and cool..before there was a ""Park"" and
before the tourists took over Godfrey was on the beach at Wreck Bay
carving,drawing and painting and his art and history is an important part of
Tofinos story . Weeping Cedar Woman is a cornerstone for that history.Bring it
back along with the tribute to Godfrey's amazing life and connection to the
area.""

organized by the RVA NOISE collective in Richmond VA.

The fest is currently in its 3rd incarnation since starting 2012. 
Originally intended to be a showcase of local artists RVA Noise Fest has expanded to include
many engaging acts from across the country and we hope to grow even more in the coming years
to include artists from all over the world.<br/><br/>Due to the expansions though, we are asking for your help (to be clear- we are asking for money to help pay the artists/venues that make this possible)! We are offering tons of merch from artists involved in the fest and the Richmond experimental scene, including a special promotion involving select choices from the RVA NOISE private collection, as well as some deep cuts from the ANTI-EVERYTHING NOISE vaults.

organized by the RVA NOISE collective in Richmond VA.

The fest is currently in its 3rd incarnation since starting 2012.

many engaging acts from across the country and we hope to grow even more in the coming years
to include artists from all over the world.Due to the expansions though, we are asking for your help (to be clear- we are asking for money to help pay the artists/venues that make this possible)! We are offering tons of merch from artists involved in the fest and the Richmond experimental scene, including a special promotion involving select choices from the RVA NOISE private collection, as well as some deep cuts from the ANTI-EVERYTHING NOISE vaults. Pre-sale tickets will also be available at STEADY SOUNDS located downtown at 322 W.

<h3><strong><em>What is Camp Kayak<br/></em></strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Camp Kayak</em> is a Creative Arts Program based on Carriacou, Grenada, WI</strong> – servicing local youths from primary school ages 8 - UP, marginalized by economic conditions of small rural West Indien Island community life. All Campers attend three weeks of a dynamic, creative and inspirational summer camp experience, otherwise NOT available to them locally.</p>
<p><strong>Camp Kayak is intended to be a Carriacou resource–</strong>celebrating Carriacou people, their talents, their interests, and inviting West Indian and Caribbean artists and professionals to Carriacou to be inspired by all that this island has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>It is also an opportunity to cultivate a vibrant artist community</strong> here on the tiny island of Carriacou, encouraging youth and community to focus on indigenous talent and local craft. Maybe one child has an artist within him or her that is just waiting to bloom right here on Carriacou!</p>
<p><em><strong>Our mission is to enlighten, educate, and inspire</strong> through various forms of Creative Arts, Natural Sciences, Sports, Music and Drama.</em></p>
<p><strong>Scholarships are available to all potential campers</strong>, funded by non-profit contribution, allowing Camp Kayak to be accessible to all children with an appetite to discover their own creative potential and take it further.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>What do we need:</strong></h3>
<div><strong>US$15,000 to run the camp this year. <br/></strong></div>
<div>
<strong><br/></strong>We have already raised around US$4,000 though various on island fund raisers but we still need an additional US$15,000.</div>
<h3><strong>What this will enable us to do:</strong></h3>
<div>This will enable the Camp to run for 6 weeks over the summer of 2013.</div>
<div>The camp will run 2 sessions of 2 weeks per session.</div>
<div>Each session will have:</div>
<ul>
<li>25 students aged between 8 and 11.</li>
<li>5 counsellors in training (ex-students over the age of 11).</li>
<li>5 counsellors, mentors or teachers (both from local and overseas).</li>
<li>1 chef and 1 cleaner.</li>
</ul><h3>Our track record:</h3>
<p>Camp Kayak was founded in January 2010, initially from a very generous donation from Sandy Armentrout - read more about Sandy <a href=""http://campkayak.org/location-ministry"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>""Sandra “Sandy” Armentrout; my mother, my mentor, my sponsor &amp; my reason for being. “Sandy” is why Camp Kayak is possible today– her support &amp; underwriting made this project come alive. She funded the initial resource library materials &amp; made many other generous gifts to the camp. We honor her in our inspiration everyday &amp; hopefully we will do her proud!</em>""</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Victoria Armentrout - Camp Kayak Founder</p>
<p><br/>Camp Kayak has run for 3 summers and had over 400 students attending so far. The students are ages 8-12 yrs and simply LOVE the camp. It gives them an opportunity to do something in their summer holiday that otherwise they would not get chance to do. Read their blog <a href=""http://campkayak.org/blog/kids/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>
<p>The scholarships given out in the local primary schools - by their principal and are available to all children. They do not have to have exemplary grades just a curiosity to explore. All students attend free. </p>
<p>We put on a bus service to pick up and drop students home at the end of camp. We even put on a ferry service to include the students who come from our sister island, Petite Martinique. (10 minutes away from Carriacou by ferry).</p>
<p>We provide a hot lunch for all children and often breakfast for those who don't receive it at home before camp.</p>
<p><br/>Here is a link to our website where you can read much much more about our work at Camp Kayak. There are videos made by the kids at Camp - some even went viral on YouTube, there is the camp song by one of our local soca artists and much more.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to contribute (but please try however small, it makes such a difference and we are so grateful) but you can contribute in other ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this page on your Facebook profile so we get maximum exposure. Tweet about it if you have Twitter. Digg or Stumble upon and use whatever social media you like best to let everyone know about our great camp.</li>
<li>Indiegogo has share tools so please use them to spread the word.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Camp Kayak is a Creative Arts Program based on Carriacou, Grenada, WI – servicing local youths from primary school ages 8 - UP, marginalized by economic conditions of small rural West Indien Island community life. All Campers attend three weeks of a dynamic, creative and inspirational summer camp experience, otherwise NOT available to them locally.
Camp Kayak is intended to be a Carriacou resource–celebrating Carriacou people, their talents, their interests, and inviting West Indian and Caribbean artists and professionals to Carriacou to be inspired by all that this island has to offer.
It is also an opportunity to cultivate a vibrant artist community here on the tiny island of Carriacou, encouraging youth and community to focus on indigenous talent and local craft. Maybe one child has an artist within him or her that is just waiting to bloom right here on Carriacou!
Our mission is to enlighten, educate, and inspire through various forms of Creative Arts, Natural Sciences, Sports, Music and Drama.
Scholarships are available to all potential campers, funded by non-profit contribution, allowing Camp Kayak to be accessible to all children with an appetite to discover their own creative potential and take it further.


What do we need:
US$15,000 to run the camp this year. 

We have already raised around US$4,000 though various on island fund raisers but we still need an additional US$15,000.
What this will enable us to do:
This will enable the Camp to run for 6 weeks over the summer of 2013.
The camp will run 2 sessions of 2 weeks per session.
Each session will have:

25 students aged between 8 and 11.
5 counsellors in training (ex-students over the age of 11).
5 counsellors, mentors or teachers (both from local and overseas).
1 chef and 1 cleaner.
Our track record:
Camp Kayak was founded in January 2010, initially from a very generous donation from Sandy Armentrout - read more about Sandy here
""Sandra “Sandy” Armentrout; my mother, my mentor, my sponsor & my reason for being. “Sandy” is why Camp Kayak is possible today– her support & underwriting made this project come alive. She funded the initial resource library materials & made many other generous gifts to the camp. We honor her in our inspiration everyday & hopefully we will do her proud!""
Victoria Armentrout - Camp Kayak Founder
Camp Kayak has run for 3 summers and had over 400 students attending so far. The students are ages 8-12 yrs and simply LOVE the camp. It gives them an opportunity to do something in their summer holiday that otherwise they would not get chance to do. Read their blog here
The scholarships given out in the local primary schools - by their principal and are available to all children. They do not have to have exemplary grades just a curiosity to explore. All students attend free. 
We put on a bus service to pick up and drop students home at the end of camp. We even put on a ferry service to include the students who come from our sister island, Petite Martinique. (10 minutes away from Carriacou by ferry).
We provide a hot lunch for all children and often breakfast for those who don't receive it at home before camp.
Here is a link to our website where you can read much much more about our work at Camp Kayak. There are videos made by the kids at Camp - some even went viral on YouTube, there is the camp song by one of our local soca artists and much more.

September 2013 ist mein ""Auf Wiedersehen Deutschland"" Tag.Dann, ankommen, am 29igsten in Kerry.Dort Leben, nahe am Meer sein, in einer ländlichen, friedlichen Gegend, wo ich endlich zu meinen Wurzeln der traditionellen Malerei zurückkehren möchte, ebenso wie Photoshootings von Landschaftsbildern bis hin zu Fashionshoots und ja, natürlich werde ich auch weiterhin digital arbeiten und hoffentlich meine Fähigkeiten darin weiter entwickeln.Natürlich ist dieser Umzug begleitet von vielen Ausgaben und neuen Anschaffungen die gemacht werden müssen. Zum Beispiel muss ich mir ein gebrauchtes Auto kaufen, denn ohne wäre ich wohl etwas verloren in der ""irischen Wildnis"". ;)Und nun, weil Murphys Gesetz auch mein oberstes Gesetz ist, hat meine gute, alte Canon Kamera komplett aufgegeben. Sie hatte schon länger einige Macken aber nun ist  sie endgültig verschieden. R.I.P.Also soll es nun so sein, dass ich nach Irland auswandere, in das Land meiner Inspiration und nicht mehr in der Lage sein dort Bilder zu machen?An diesem Punkt angekommen hoffe ich auf eure Unterstützung und Hilfe.""Kerry Me Home""Was ich mit dem Geld machen werde?Mit und von eurem Support werde ich mir eine neue Kamera mit zwei Objektiven kaufen und mir damit die Möglichkeit öffnen mit einigen fantastischen Designern 2014 in ungewöhnlichen Settings zusammenzuarbeiten.Ich plane neue Artbooks, Kalender und und und, jedoch ohne Kamera wird das ein Ding der Unmöglichkeit bleiben und bis ich all das Geld selbst zusammengespart habe - nun ja, würden Jahre vergehen.Wieso ich flexible Finanzierung ausgewählt habe?Ich habe mich für flexible Finanzierung entschieden, weil jeder $ zählt, auch wenn ich mein großes Ziel nicht erreiche.Bitte sei ein aktiver Part meiner Kunst und derer Entstehung! Deine Belohnungen / Perks:Ich habe eine Liste von Perks auf der rechten Seite hinzugefügt, als Dankeschön für eure Unterstützung, und vielleicht bist du imstande den einen oder anderen Dollar zu spenden um mir zu helfen eine Kamera auf der ""Reise meines Lebens"" dabei zu haben.(Die Beschreibung der Perks ist nur in englisch möglich, falls du eine Übersetzung benötigst scheue nicht mich anzusprechen)

I have worked so hard to be able to make my living doing makeup quite simply because it's my passion. I can't imagine not doing it for the rest of my life. I've also recently been focusing on my YouTube channel, making tutorials and makeup videos, which is something I truly enjoy doing. I would love to be able to get a new camera.

If I reach my goal amount I'll be able to get a new camera for my portfolio shots and YouTube videos (currently I do it all with my iphone, which works well, but it's tedious).</li> <li>When you contribute, you'll have access to perks like makeovers, one-on-one makeup lessons, and the chance to have your Halloween or AnimeKon makeup done by me!</li>
<li>When you contribute you'll be added to a mailing list, and you'll get regular updates from me about how things are going, both with the campaign and with my practice. You'll be the first to know about any workshops or seminars I'm holding, and you'll also get fun sneak peeks of what I'm working on, as well as the opportunity to weight in, ask me questions or request videos and looks. </li>

<p>We all know the brilliance in makeup that is the otherwordly spirit, or the zombie, or the monster, or the alien. The Joker, Mystique, the Klingons, Hellboy, The Grinch, Pennywise, Freddie. Did you see the incredible, realistic old-age makeup on Brad Pitt in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" or the old wicked witch makeup on Michelle Pfeiffer as Lamia in ""Stardust""? What about the evil-looking tribal designs applied on Ray Park as Darth Maul in ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace""? </p>

<p></p>
<p>But movie makeup isn't just about prosthetics or creating witches or monsters or zombies. It's also not only about age makeup either. Movie makeup ranges from extremely subtle to outrageously involved and creative. It's not only about applying the makeup, it's about designing and creating the look/effect/creature itself! Of course all wigs, bruises, cuts, wounds, dirt and so on are also the purview of the hair &amp; makeup team on any film or TV set, as are body special effects like dismembered limbs and live-action injuries. But there is also a subtlety to makeup artistry.</p>

<br/><p>Have you watched ""Star Trek: Into Darkness""? Did you notice the blue and purple shadows around actor Benedict Cumberbatch's eyes and the hollows of his face? You may not have, because you weren't supposed to. That was very subtle and incredibly effective makeup. In addition to his unparalleled acting, those simple shadows made Khan look incredibly menacing, making the viewer very uneasy to look at him. How about Angeline Jolie's sharp prosthetic cheekbones as ""Maleficent""? Such a simple detail that instantly changed her appearance. This subtlety is in stark contrast to the brilliant makeup on Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"", who was made to look progessively more and more possessed with lots of clever makeup and prosthetics. Did you know that the infamous ""pea soup vomit"" scene was a creation of the talented lead Makeup Artist Dick Smith (RIP) and assistant Rick Baker (both oscar award-winning makeup artists)? Among all the other effects, they created prosthetics that hid a special tube and mouthpiece that could spew out pea soup at the flick of a switch!</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Have you seen ""The Hunger Games""? The crazy, futuristic makeup in that movie was artistic and beautiful and the work of an exceptional makeup team (headed by the oscar-winning Ve Neill, who happens to be affiliated with the Cinema Makeup School, which is my dream school). That makeup helped separate the residents of the Capital from the Districts: they were weird and stylish to the point of insanity, and helped you feel how far removed they were from the reality of life in the Panem Districts. Ve Neill is also the creator of the makeup effects on the film Beetlejuice and Mrs Doubtfire, among others. That goes to show the range that these talented people have.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">How about Kristen Stewart as a pregnant and deathly ill-looking Bella Swan in ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1""? That makeup utterly captivates and fascinates me. They gave her amazing 'natural' prosthetic cheekbones, jawline, chin, collarbones and forehead, paired with incredible painting and shadows to make her look emaciated and sunken, as though her flesh had shrunk onto her bones, and like she was at death's door. Same goes for the makeup on Jared Leto as Rayon in ""Dallas Buyers Club"". It absolutely breaks your heart to see him in that film. A similar effect was achieved decades ago in ""Stephen King's: Thinner"" on actor Robert John Burke, whose body, with the help of progressive prosthetics and makeup, went from being very fat to wasting away throughout the movie as a result of a curse.</span></p>

 I have worked as a professional Makeup Artist in the fashion and beauty industry for over 10 years. I'm completely self-taught, and I work really hard at my craft. I'm constantly teaching myself whatever I can and practicing to perfect my skill set, learn new techniques, or create my own. I have worked so hard to be able to make my living doing makeup quite simply because it's my passion. I can't imagine not doing it for the rest of my life. I've also recently been focusing on my YouTube channel, making tutorials and makeup videos, which is something I truly enjoy doing. I would love to be able to get a new camera. But that's not my main goal for this campaign.
I have always believed that we should never remain stagnant. I want to continue to learn and expand my talents and my expertise and for that I need to go to school and study something new.






When I was around 12 or 13 I watched the films Braveheart and Mrs. Doubtfire, and realized that makeup wasn't just about lipstick and mascara. I wanted to know how that magic was made. I knew, even then, that this was something I wanted to do.



My dream is to do makeup for Film & TV. I want to learn how to create incredible special effects, characters, and creatures with makeup. I want to be able to use my talents to bring any era or landscape to life on screen. Makeup Artistry is my living, and it's my passion.





What I Need
 I really need to start experimenting more with special effects makeup, and if (when) I do get accepted into makeup school, I will need to have a comprehensive kit and amateur SFX portfolio.


 
I've set this campaign at $1500 US so that if I fall short of the goal I can still afford to put together a really good kit. I've included in my goal amount the estimated shipping costs and duties to bring the products here to Barbados. If I reach my goal amount I'll be able to get a new camera for my portfolio shots and YouTube videos (currently I do it all with my iphone, which works well, but it's tedious). When you contribute, you'll have access to perks like makeovers, one-on-one makeup lessons, and the chance to have your Halloween or AnimeKon makeup done by me!
When you contribute you'll be added to a mailing list, and you'll get regular updates from me about how things are going, both with the campaign and with my practice. You'll be the first to know about any workshops or seminars I'm holding, and you'll also get fun sneak peeks of what I'm working on, as well as the opportunity to weight in, ask me questions or request videos and looks. 
If you are not in Barbados I realize I cannot offer you any perks at this time. I can only offer you my undying gratitude. So if you are from another country and you donate anyway, I thank you, truly, from the bottom of my heart. 





  Why The International Film Industry is a billion-dollar one, with countless people being employed making countless films every year, and every single one needs a hair and makeup team.




We all know the brilliance in makeup that is the otherwordly spirit, or the zombie, or the monster, or the alien. The Joker, Mystique, the Klingons, Hellboy, The Grinch, Pennywise, Freddie. Did you see the incredible, realistic old-age makeup on Brad Pitt in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" or the old wicked witch makeup on Michelle Pfeiffer as Lamia in ""Stardust""? What about the evil-looking tribal designs applied on Ray Park as Darth Maul in ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace""? 





But movie makeup isn't just about prosthetics or creating witches or monsters or zombies. It's also not only about age makeup either. Movie makeup ranges from extremely subtle to outrageously involved and creative. It's not only about applying the makeup, it's about designing and creating the look/effect/creature itself! Of course all wigs, bruises, cuts, wounds, dirt and so on are also the purview of the hair & makeup team on any film or TV set, as are body special effects like dismembered limbs and live-action injuries. But there is also a subtlety to makeup artistry.



Have you watched ""Star Trek: Into Darkness""? Did you notice the blue and purple shadows around actor Benedict Cumberbatch's eyes and the hollows of his face? You may not have, because you weren't supposed to. That was very subtle and incredibly effective makeup. In addition to his unparalleled acting, those simple shadows made Khan look incredibly menacing, making the viewer very uneasy to look at him. How about Angeline Jolie's sharp prosthetic cheekbones as ""Maleficent""? Such a simple detail that instantly changed her appearance. This subtlety is in stark contrast to the brilliant makeup on Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"", who was made to look progessively more and more possessed with lots of clever makeup and prosthetics. Did you know that the infamous ""pea soup vomit"" scene was a creation of the talented lead Makeup Artist Dick Smith (RIP) and assistant Rick Baker (both oscar award-winning makeup artists)? Among all the other effects, they created prosthetics that hid a special tube and mouthpiece that could spew out pea soup at the flick of a switch!




Have you seen ""The Hunger Games""? The crazy, futuristic makeup in that movie was artistic and beautiful and the work of an exceptional makeup team (headed by the oscar-winning Ve Neill, who happens to be affiliated with the Cinema Makeup School, which is my dream school). That makeup helped separate the residents of the Capital from the Districts: they were weird and stylish to the point of insanity, and helped you feel how far removed they were from the reality of life in the Panem Districts. Ve Neill is also the creator of the makeup effects on the film Beetlejuice and Mrs Doubtfire, among others. That goes to show the range that these talented people have.




How about Kristen Stewart as a pregnant and deathly ill-looking Bella Swan in ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1""? That makeup utterly captivates and fascinates me. They gave her amazing 'natural' prosthetic cheekbones, jawline, chin, collarbones and forehead, paired with incredible painting and shadows to make her look emaciated and sunken, as though her flesh had shrunk onto her bones, and like she was at death's door. Same goes for the makeup on Jared Leto as Rayon in ""Dallas Buyers Club"". It absolutely breaks your heart to see him in that film. A similar effect was achieved decades ago in ""Stephen King's: Thinner"" on actor Robert John Burke, whose body, with the help of progressive prosthetics and makeup, went from being very fat to wasting away throughout the movie as a result of a curse.






Pick any period piece and you delve even deeper into the world of makeup: Look at ""Pride and Prejudice"" starring Keira Knightly. You need makeup under the unforgiving lights and HD cameras, but how do you make it so that characters that could not afford makeup or that were living in a time before most modern makeup was invented look like they're not wearing any? What about their hair, eyebrows? You may think it's insignificant, but the way the characters look in a film set you up, on an intellectual and emotional level, to receive the movie, to believe the characters and the setting. Look at the ethereal yet fierce and mesmerizing Elves in ""The Lord of The Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" films. Their pale, porcelain smooth skin isn't just CGI, it's 85% makeup.



This whole world just calls to me. I know I'm creative enough and passionate enough to do well as a Film & TV Makeup artist. 
I don't just want to work on blockbuster films, though I definitely am aiming for that too! Barbados has a blossoming film and cosplay industry and I want to be able to give my talents to that community as well. We have a lot of talent here, and if I have the training and the kit, I can be a part of that. And believe me, I will wave the Bajan flag no matter where in the world I end up!

Concerts, workshops, lectures, film screenings, theater, cultural exchanges, artistic residencies, are just some of the production formats that we have been developing since 2005.Arte multidisciplinario que asume la responsabilidad social del contexto que lo determina , sin demeritar en las formas de ejecución y lenguaje estético, el cual es coherente y afirmativo con nuestras condiciones históricas de existencia, solidificando la reproducción de narrativas y conocimiento relevantes las cuales se constituyen como modelos  en la utilización de vehículos como el Rap o el Spoken Word  traducidos a ejercicios de pedagogía critica crecida al calor de la melanina. Conciertos, talleres, lecturas, muestras de cine, presentaciones teatrales, residencias artísticas, intercambios culturales, son algunos de los formatos de producción bajo los cuales hemos trabajado desde el 2005.Photo: Quilomboarte Decolonial Studies Project, Mexico City, Mexico, March 2014,  2014 brings the development of two transgressive projects: a documentary film and a project of intervention in public spaces.Quilomboarte is in the research and development phase of production of a documentary film, in which we will visually expose an analogy between processes of current counter-hegemonic cultural production and colonial era maroon societies in Mexico, the United States, Colombia and Brazil. The historic yuxtaposition fulfill the urgent need of establishing decolonial work, critical pedagogies, and vehicles of expression, such as rap or Spoken Word, as relevant platforms and systems of information for emancipatory movements and agendas. Recognizing the high impact of visual language, we choose the format of film—in order to share this invisibilized chapter of our history with the widest of audiences. Quilomboarte, through self-generated funds has already secured camera equipment and lenses, and highly talented human capital. Money raised will be designated for the following: air fare and travel expenses for film crew to/from site locations.Photo: Quilomboarte 7th anniversary show, Mexico City, Mexico, May 2012.El 2014 representa el lanzamiento de dos proyectos fundamentales y transgresores: un documental y un proyecto de intervención en el espacio público.El primer proyecto consiste en la elaboración de un documental a través del cual expondremos visualmente una analogía entre el proceso de creación de cultura contra-hegemonica actual por parte de diversos creadores en diferentes  formatos de producción y las sociedades cimarronas existentes en la época colonial, enfocados en 4 comunidades especificas ubicadas en México, Georgia/E.U, Colombia y Brasil. Una yuxtaposición histórica que cumple con la necesidad urgente de establecer al trabajo decolonial, a la pedagogía critica y a vehículos como el Rap o el Spoken Word como  sistemas de conocimiento y plataformas relevantes en diversas agendas emancipatorias. Es asi que a través del lenguaje visual, el cual reconocemos como de alto impacto, intentaremos compartir con el numero mas grande de audiencia posible este gran segmento invisibilizado de nuestra historia. Los fondos generados seran utilizados para los siguientes propósitos: pasajes aeréos y gastos generados por el viaje. Photo: Fuerzas Basicas!. (B.I.M.), Quilomboarte building with the youth, California, 2013.Itinerant Quilombo is a project of intervention in public spaces. When we speak of physical spaces in the context of the dominant hegemonies,  we must necessarily look at the diameters that state and corporativist entities have established as norms to commodify time and its relation to the civic body as merchandise. Public space, in which marginalized peoples can co-exist, interact, or enjoy free or affodable cultural offerings are increasingly more difficult to encounter in major metropolis of the globe. Aware of this complex process we have created the project Itinerant Quilombo in which we revert the centralization of culture by mobilizing our project directly to the heart of communities. Itinerant Quilombo will bring multi-disciplinary production, music showcases, spoken word, film screenings, theater, workshops and lectures to strategic neighborhood enclaves in Mexico and then replicated internationally. Money raised will secure the purchase of needed elements for program implementation, including an HD projector and a mobile sound system.El segundo lleva por nombre “Quilombo Itinerante”; el cual es un proyecto de intervencion del espacio publico. Cuando hablamos de espacio en el marco dominante de las hegemonías nos remontamos indistintamente hacia los diámetros  que el corporativismo o el estado han normativizado y diseñado para mercantilizar el tiempo en relación con la existencia del ser cívico. Pensar en espacios públicos en los cuales los sectores menos favorecidos de la población puedan coexistir , interactuar o disfrutar de una oferta cultural gratuita son cada vez mas difíciles  de encontrar en las grandes ciudades del mundo. Conscientes de este proceso avasallador hemos creado la iniciativa de un Quilombo Itinerante, bajo la cual revertimos el efecto centralizador mediante la movilización de nuestro proyecto directamente al corazón de las comunidades a través del montaje completo de una actividad multidisciplinaria (presentación musical, poética,  muestra documental, fragmentos de obras de teatro, lecturas y talleres) en alguno de los enclaves  estratégicos del barrio en especifico, contando siempre con la participación directa de agentes locales propios de la comunidad los cuales idealmente lograran replicar estos programas. Las dos primeros ejercicios se realizaran en el mes de Mayo en la ciudad de Oaxaca y Puebla, con la intención de ser ejecutadas periódicamente en diferentes ciudades. El dinero recaudado asegurará la compra y financiamiento de todos los elementos necesarios para la implementación de los programas, así como del proyector y sistema de sonido mobil. Photo: Quilomboarte Youth event, Watsonville, California, 2014Your support is essential! With your help and solidarity we will be able to solidify two of our most transgressive projects to date.

numerous ways by strong and musically arranged texts, accompanied by live
music.<b>  </b>This time the team will focus on bringing the interdisciplinary
and contemporary art into the public space, including to every interested
person on the street/in parks and the like, making it available to everybody,
and giving the opportunity to spontaneously enjoy high quality art for little
economical contribution. Arising from our own interpretation of the piece, we
wish to create a mobile theatre, being convinced that the privilege to
experience and enjoy art, should be made accessible to as many people as
possible, including to small cities and towns.<b>  </b>The stage design will be
adapted to the mobility of the theatre and to begin with, we will be touring
with one bus around Austria. Furthermore we will also travel to neighbouring
countries. The grand opening will take place in a public space in Vienna and
further appearances in this city are planned. In regard to this matter, the
respective authorities have been contacted and informed. The Company stays true
to it’s basic concept and wants to give the opportunity to as many professional
international artists as possible, to exchange, develop and rediscover

<p></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p></div>","Concept
  Where the elements of circus,
acrobatic, contemporary dance, theatre, body percussion, song and instrumental
music meet and intertwine, there begins the real challenge for the contemporary
art initiative „tanz.labor.labyrinth“ directed by Ulduz Ahmadzadeh.
We would like to utilize these crossroads as new and inspiring dance and
performance methods.

The world famous book “The Little
Prince” takes us through a socially
critical discussion, including the authentic biography of the author Antoine de
Saint-Exupéry. As an international group, we take on the artistic task to
freely interpret his stunning story. The choreography will be supported in
numerous ways by strong and musically arranged texts, accompanied by live
music.  This time the team will focus on bringing the interdisciplinary
and contemporary art into the public space, including to every interested
person on the street/in parks and the like, making it available to everybody,
and giving the opportunity to spontaneously enjoy high quality art for little
economical contribution. Arising from our own interpretation of the piece, we
wish to create a mobile theatre, being convinced that the privilege to
experience and enjoy art, should be made accessible to as many people as
possible, including to small cities and towns.  The stage design will be
adapted to the mobility of the theatre and to begin with, we will be touring
with one bus around Austria. Furthermore we will also travel to neighbouring
countries. The grand opening will take place in a public space in Vienna and
further appearances in this city are planned. In regard to this matter, the
respective authorities have been contacted and informed. The Company stays true
to it’s basic concept and wants to give the opportunity to as many professional
international artists as possible, to exchange, develop and rediscover
themselves in this creative process.

people during 2004-2008. In 2007 she accomplished her studies in direction at
the university of art in Soureh in Teheran, where she produced experimental films such as Centre less circle (2001) and Sleepers (2004). Since 2008 Ulduz lives in Vienna and works
as a dance educator and choreographer. Uldusz took it as her personal task to
conserve the traditional classical Persian folk dance as cultural goods. She
studied dance pedagogics at the Konservatorium Vienna and since 2013 she accomplishes
her master in social design at the university of Applied Arts. Since 2012 she established the contemporary

Artists at Work?  And what’s the big excitement?</b></p>
<p><b><u>Who is YA@W?</u></b></p>
<p>Yukon Artists at Work
(YA@W) is a non-profit visual arts cooperative with the vision of rejuvenating
itself in a downtown location. Conceived in 2003 as a supportive community for
artists to take control of their own careers by creating their own venue
to promote their art, YA@W has built a strong reputation in the Yukon.
Membership fluctuates between 30 and 40 members as artists come and go,
lives change focus, or some dear friends pass on. YA@W was listed as one of the
top 10 hidden gems of Canada by the global tourism website Trip Advisor, and
has been visited by notable people like former Governor General, Michaëlle Jean
and 2010 Olympics CEO, John Furlong.</p>
<p><b><u>We work very
hard and do lots of cool stuff:</u></b></p>
<p>YA@W hosts 12
exhibitions every year with free opening events, conducts free school and adult
tours and a range of artist talks and demonstrations. YA@W has spearheaded many community projects through its active members. The Yukon Artists Relief Fund
to assist local artists and their families dealing with medical emergencies or
financial struggles was initiated by YA@W members. This year YA@W conducted a special project for youth and seniors
involving a series of art-based workshops through autumn, winter and spring. YA@W members held the annual week-long <i>Plein
Air Festival, </i>where visual artists
do their art in specific outdoor locations for tourists and locals to come out
and enjoy.This culminated in an exhibition hosted YA@W. Through the years, YA@W has helped hundreds of artists,
welcomed thousands of visitors, and become an important part of our northern
community. We believe that everyone, every single person, should be able
to have art in their lives and feel welcome at our space.</p>
<p><b><u>Why do we need
to move? </u></b></p>
<p>Our gallery is currently located in
the industrial area, up a long flight of stairs, on top of a warehouse in
Whitehorse. YA@W has come to realize this location is hindering its
effectiveness and its ability to maximize benefits to the community. This is
evident in comments from gallery visitors, like this one: “The gallery is
awesome and by far my new favourite gallery north of 60; such a group of
fantastic artists.  The location sucks though….” Members are also feeling
the same dissatisfaction with the current location.</p>
<p>In a downtown
location, YA@W will have a bigger, richer, and more lasting impact for
our wonderful community of artists and the art-loving community as a whole.
This move will be a shot of adrenaline that picks us up and moves us on to a
whole new level of artist support and community involvement. It's a new beginning. YA@W will be an
even more beloved, iconic destination.</p>
<p><b><u>What do we need
funds for?</u></b></p>
<p>We found a funky building in a fantastic downtown location but it requires substantial work for occupancy.  We need to remove and replace the furnace and
ducting, a second washroom, other renovations and some upgraded retail
equipment. Since YA@W does not profit from its activities, a
reserve of funds to draw upon does not exist. This is where you come in. </p><p>We are
asking you to help YA@W meet our funding goal, and receive 50% of that same
amount in a gallery gift certificate to spend after the first year in the new
location, when YA@W will be well on it’s feet and financially able to repay your
kindness. And there are more perks too!</p>
<p><b><u>YA@W perks!</u></b></p>
<p>Our perks give back to
you with a big thank you for your support. We love doing what we do in the
Yukon, and we want each of you who donate to have art in your lives and to
experience the excitement of our new beginning. Our perks that help us reach
this goal vary according to donor categories and are: </p>
<p>-<span>  </span>the gratitude of over
30 Yukon artists,</p>
<p>-<span> </span> YA@W pins,</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>a listing of your name
online and in our gallery, indicating donor category</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>a gift certificate of
50% of your donation to spend in our gallery after the first year in the new
location, when YA@W will be well on it’s feet and financially able to repay
your kindness.</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>we have four categories where we’ll name a room in your honour (eg. The Smith room).</p>
<p>-<span>  A private party! ... </span>use our gorgeous
new gallery for one private 2015 event with 2 or 3 artists present to assist during your event.</p>
<p><b><u>When, where,
how?</u></b></p>
<p>All this is all taking
place in Whitehorse, Yukon in Canada. The new Whitehorse location is the blue
building at #4129, 4th Avenue. Have a look at the map and the photo of the bright
blue building in the <i>Gallery</i> section. YA@W will move locations in January 2015. We have assessed needs
and are currently acquiring firm competitive quotes for various aspects of the
work.</p>
<p>The work will be
managed by YA@W members and performed by local contractors and suppliers, the
membership and volunteers.  Many of our members had previous careers that
will ensure our move will go smoothly and renovations will be managed
cost effectively. Among us we have engineers, set designers, stage carpenters, project managers, financial managers and
more.</p>
<p>And we will keep
everyone updated on what we’re doing, how we’re doing and answer any
questions!</p>
<p><b><u>How you can
help:</u></b></p>
<p>Donate here and now.
Share the campaign online. Tell somebody about it. Tell everybody about it. The bigger the
network, the more likely we are to reach our goal. Get co-workers or
friends together to go in on a big perk... have a great private party! Write
an article about the project. Get excited for our grand new beginning in 2015!</p>
<p>From all of us at

And MJ Warshawski gets a set too for putting us so close to the mark!We'll have  more extra perks as we pass other milestones, so keep on sharing this campaign.UP-DATE: December 6th, 2014WOW! Yukoners and the art loving community are sooooo awesome! We have surpassed our goal. Please don't let that stop you from contributing.When we began this crowd-funding campaign, we were apprehensive, and therefore conservative in placing our goal at $11,000. We are amazed by the generosity out there. We can make good use of additional funds for our renovations, reducing the amount of our bank loan required for this project. THE NEW STRETCH GOAL IS $20,000. Please encourage those in your community of friends and family  to support with a contribution of whatever feels right to them.What is Yukon
Artists at Work?  And what’s the big excitement?
Who is YA@W?
Yukon Artists at Work
(YA@W) is a non-profit visual arts cooperative with the vision of rejuvenating
itself in a downtown location. Conceived in 2003 as a supportive community for
artists to take control of their own careers by creating their own venue
to promote their art, YA@W has built a strong reputation in the Yukon.
Membership fluctuates between 30 and 40 members as artists come and go,
lives change focus, or some dear friends pass on. YA@W was listed as one of the
top 10 hidden gems of Canada by the global tourism website Trip Advisor, and
has been visited by notable people like former Governor General, Michaëlle Jean
and 2010 Olympics CEO, John Furlong.
We work very
hard and do lots of cool stuff:
YA@W hosts 12
exhibitions every year with free opening events, conducts free school and adult
tours and a range of artist talks and demonstrations. YA@W has spearheaded many community projects through its active members. The Yukon Artists Relief Fund
to assist local artists and their families dealing with medical emergencies or
financial struggles was initiated by YA@W members. This year YA@W conducted a special project for youth and seniors
involving a series of art-based workshops through autumn, winter and spring. YA@W members held the annual week-long Plein
Air Festival, where visual artists
do their art in specific outdoor locations for tourists and locals to come out
and enjoy.This culminated in an exhibition hosted YA@W. Through the years, YA@W has helped hundreds of artists,
welcomed thousands of visitors, and become an important part of our northern
community. We believe that everyone, every single person, should be able
to have art in their lives and feel welcome at our space.
Why do we need
to move? 
Our gallery is currently located in
the industrial area, up a long flight of stairs, on top of a warehouse in
Whitehorse. YA@W has come to realize this location is hindering its
effectiveness and its ability to maximize benefits to the community. This is
evident in comments from gallery visitors, like this one: “The gallery is
awesome and by far my new favourite gallery north of 60; such a group of
fantastic artists.  The location sucks though….” Members are also feeling
the same dissatisfaction with the current location.
In a downtown
location, YA@W will have a bigger, richer, and more lasting impact for
our wonderful community of artists and the art-loving community as a whole.
This move will be a shot of adrenaline that picks us up and moves us on to a
whole new level of artist support and community involvement. It's a new beginning. YA@W will be an
even more beloved, iconic destination.
What do we need
funds for?
We found a funky building in a fantastic downtown location but it requires substantial work for occupancy.  We need to remove and replace the furnace and
ducting, a second washroom, other renovations and some upgraded retail
equipment. Since YA@W does not profit from its activities, a
reserve of funds to draw upon does not exist. This is where you come in. We are
asking you to help YA@W meet our funding goal, and receive 50% of that same
amount in a gallery gift certificate to spend after the first year in the new
location, when YA@W will be well on it’s feet and financially able to repay your
kindness. And there are more perks too!
YA@W perks!
Our perks give back to
you with a big thank you for your support. We love doing what we do in the
Yukon, and we want each of you who donate to have art in your lives and to
experience the excitement of our new beginning. Our perks that help us reach
this goal vary according to donor categories and are: 
-  the gratitude of over
30 Yukon artists,
-  YA@W pins,
-  a listing of your name
online and in our gallery, indicating donor category
-  a gift certificate of
50% of your donation to spend in our gallery after the first year in the new
location, when YA@W will be well on it’s feet and financially able to repay
your kindness.
-  we have four categories where we’ll name a room in your honour (eg. The Smith room).
-  A private party! ... use our gorgeous
new gallery for one private 2015 event with 2 or 3 artists present to assist during your event.
When, where,
how?
All this is all taking
place in Whitehorse, Yukon in Canada. The new Whitehorse location is the blue
building at #4129, 4th Avenue. Have a look at the map and the photo of the bright
blue building in the Gallery section. YA@W will move locations in January 2015. We have assessed needs
and are currently acquiring firm competitive quotes for various aspects of the
work.
The work will be
managed by YA@W members and performed by local contractors and suppliers, the
membership and volunteers.  Many of our members had previous careers that
will ensure our move will go smoothly and renovations will be managed
cost effectively. Among us we have engineers, set designers, stage carpenters, project managers, financial managers and
more.
And we will keep
everyone updated on what we’re doing, how we’re doing and answer any
questions!
How you can
help:
Donate here and now.
Share the campaign online. Tell somebody about it. Tell everybody about it. The bigger the
network, the more likely we are to reach our goal. Get co-workers or
friends together to go in on a big perk... have a great private party! Write
an article about the project. Get excited for our grand new beginning in 2015!
From all of us at
YA@W, thank you so very much for your interest, we hope you will check out our
web-site, facebook page, pictures, and get involved.

<br/>The History</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Philadelphia has a strong history of activism in its many neighborhoods and communities.  Over the last ten years, artists have flocked to the city in unprecedented numbers. Many of them work on art projects with neighborhood or ethnic communities.  
 <span>The Artblog, a leader in the Philadelphia art community founded by two artist activists, </span><span>responded to this need and interest with the creation of the Artist and Social
Responsibility class to engage college students. As
artists and citizens of this region’s future, young

<p></p>
<p>Philadelphia’s undergraduate population is a great,
untapped resource in a city that was recently called the poorest big city in
the country. Many undergraduates see the needs in the city, but do not know how
to get involved or how to make a difference in their own community. The project
helps students investigate the practice of community art and channels their
energy, enthusiasm and skills in a meaningful project that will become a
“laboratory for social responsibility” and an incubator for future leaders in
the community art movement. Young adults meet with the national
thought-leaders, arts directors, and community change agents, building a
professional network to fuel their studies and career path. They work
together on community issues of importance to the Village of Arts and
Humanities.</p>
<p>Participating high school students are challenged by
an underfunded and broken School District. The ASR class provides the
students an entry to college in a direct way they will not experience
otherwise. The college-level work they are doing in this class will lay
the groundwork for further education beyond high school.<br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
We are a group of creative and motivated friends: architects, artists, photographers and writers who have come together with a shared love for Tankwa Town.
 
Tankwa Town is the name given to the collection of art, people and co-operation that is AfrikaBurn - an official regional event of the Burning Man Festival - held in the Tankwa Karoo, South Africa. AfrikaBurn upholds the guiding principles of Burning Man. It is a public art festival, promoting the creative arts and radical expression through building a temporary community of collaborative arts projects, non-commercialism and collective participation. For those that have been no explanation is necessary, for those that haven't descriptions seem to fall short. 
Having attended AfrikaBurn 2011, friends Christo Van Der Hoven and Andrew Moerdyk were interested in how they would approach building a structure for the festival. As architecture students, they reflected on the amount of time at university spent talking rather than making. “You end up getting shoved into an office after being taught so much but don't have anything to show for it. I mean I understand you don't give a surgeon a knife and let him start cutting immediately, but there are certain things we can experiment with and Khamsin is one of those instances. AfrikaBurn has given us the opportunity to create something beautiful and learn through making,"" notes Christo.


We still needed someone who could make this a reality. Enter honours year sculpture student, Haroon Gunn-Salie. Haroon's invaluable experience in organising collaborative arts projects and events was the key piece missing for the project to move forward. His role in the team has helped take Khamsin from the drawing board into reality.
AfrikaBurn is the perfect context for such a theoretical and technical exercise - it's the middle of nowhere, the perfect place for experimenting with temporary space-making. With support from the University of Cape Town and engineering assistance from the internationally renowned engineering firm, Arup, Khamsin got underway.
The project is inspired by the Khamsin - a five day period of sandstorms in North Africa.
 

 
The structure is an experiment in rapid design and construction, responding to the vastness of the Tankwa Karoo and exuberance of AfrikaBurn. The project makes use of new and innovative intervention methods and processes within a emergent platform for radical expression. Rather than a traditional timber structure, Khamsin will be constructed from a cardboard composite - digitally fabricated and slot joined. 
 

The short lifespan and unique location offer a challenging and unique context within which to test, explore and share ideas. Expressed as a dynamic surface, whipped into form and frozen, the design is articulated as a gridded structure that serves as both formal expression and structural system. 
 
What We Need
After being selected as a piece for this year's event, Khamsin was awarded the largest grant given by AfrikaBurn in its history, to facilitate the execution of the project. However, in line with the creative grant policy of AfrikaBurn, this grant represents only half of the total costs of the project. Therefore we need your help to get Khamsin to the desert. By helping us reach our target you will be part of making one the largest and most technically advanced scupltures in AfrikaBurn history.

<p>
</p><p>Since volunteering in India in 2009, I have always wished to work in Asia as an Art Therapist, and it was as a result of this experience held in a school for children with special needs and learning disabilities, that I decided to pursue a career as an Art Therapist.

Be loud and creative!_______________________________Italian version_________________________________CHI SONO?Ciao a tutti, sono Sara Simon, una ragazza italiana trapiantata a Londra che il prossimo anno si unirà al team di Art Refuge UK per portare il mio lavoro come Arte Terapeuta in Nepal.CHE COSA é 'Send your Postcard to Nepal'?Send your postcard to Nepal è una campagna di raccolta fondi che ho creato per finanziare la mia collaborazione con Art Refuge UK. Per aiutarmi in in questa impresa puoi contribuire alla raccolta fondi  acquistando la tua #postcardtonepal, cioè una cartolina realizzata a mano da arte terapeuti ed artisti internazionali, con lo scopo di finanziare il mio progetto di collaborazione con Art Refuge UK. Puoi vedere tutte le cartoline disponibili su questa gallery.Con la tua donazione puoi specificare quale postcard desideri ricevere, ed io farò il possibile per fartela avere! (Nel caso la cartolina da te scelta sia già stata 'inviata' te ne manderò un altra altrettanto bella!) WHY Art Refuge UK?Nel 2009 dopo un' esperienza di volontariato in India in una scuola per bambini disabili, ho preso la decisione di proseguire i miei studi dedicandomi all' Arte Terapia. Da quel giorno ho sempre sognato di tornare in Asia come arte terapeuta. Durante il Master in Art Psychotherapy presso la Goldsmith University of London, sono venuta a conoscenza del programma di Art Refuge, e condividendone gli ideali ho deciso di unirmi al loro progetto.Art Refuge UK è una ONG inglese che si occupa di dare un supporto emotivo attraverso l'arte terapia a bambini e giovani rifugiati Tibetani che arrivano in Nepal alla ricerca di un futuro migliore. Dopo il devastante sisma che ha colpito il Nepal nell' Aprile - Maggio 2015, Art Refuge UK chiede l’ausilio di Arte Terapeuti per rispondere alle richieste di aiuto delle autorità nepalesi e di organizzazioni internazionali.Nelle zone colpite dal sisma gruppi di volontari specializzati in Arte Terapia (registrati all’albo nazionale Inglese) lavorano in collaborazione con organizzazioni locali e internazionali , pianificando attività terapeutiche di gruppo, con lo scopo di ristabilire la normalità per le strade di Kathmandu.Nonostante lo scopo principale rimanga quello di dare un aiuto ai rifugiati Tibetani, l’associazione ha accolto la domanda di espansione di un network di educazione all’Arte Terapia rivolto a professionisti nel settore della sanità e dell’educazione.Art Refuge UK ha creato e co-facilita gruppi di supporto per la popolazione locale e gruppi di condivisione per gli operatori psico-sociali, artisti e insegnanti che stanno lottando per rispondere alle esigenze attuali create dalla situazione di emergenza causata dal sisma.Con la tua donazione potrai contribuire a diffondere l’importante ruolo dell’Arte Terapia in contesti di vulnerabilità, infanzia, e migrazione, e valorizzare il grande impegno di Art Refuge UK nei suoi progetti in Europa e all'estero. Per rimanere aggiornato sul progetto 'Send Your Postcard to Nepal' puoi seguirmi su www.sarasimon.it e su Facebook !Grazie di cuoreSara",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Emotions &amp; Commotions</h3>
<p>Throughout October 2016 Berlin welcomes once again the largest German festival for photography, the 7th European Month of Photography. As Associated Partner of the EMOP Berlin the first edition of the Berlin Foto Biennale  - and 4th edition of the Biennial for Fine Art and Documentary Photography - will take place at the elegant Palazzo Italia, situated in the historic heart of Berlin, in a venue of 24,000 sq/mt. After Madrid, Buenos Aires and Malaga, Berlin was chosen as a new base to promote emerging talents and established artists from all over the world. Emotions and Commotions Across Cultures  will present 1230 photos by 446 contemporary artists from 41 countries of all continents – among them 65% women, who have been awarded in different editions of the Julia Margaret Cameron Award for Women Photographers .</p>
<p>The works represent a wide spectrum of styles ranging from documentary and wild life, to portrait and experimental photography. Recognizing a wide array of artistic expression across diverse cultures, the Biennial presents a contemporary overview of the different schools of thought emerging from the United States to China, from Australia to Turkey and from Senegal to Mexico.</p>
<p>The Biennial also contains selected works by Steve McCurry. His solo exhibition 'Retrospective' forms part of the Biennial as special invitee.</p>

<p>The works on display here showcase emotions that can be tricky to understand within ourselves, since many of them increase the likelihood of chaos and provoke a state of confused and noisy disturbance. Such are the images of “Disorder,” the portfolio of Andrea Star Reeves, which shows the abuse in mental institutions in Indonesia. </p>

<p>Such also are the images of Yusuke Suzuk chronicling the civil insurrection in Syria against a government that has transformed civilians into soldiers of the Syrian Free Army. Suzuki also puts us in a state of commotion by revealing the crisis facing immigrant families on the Island of Lesbos.</p>

<p>A group of photographers composed by Vienne Rea, Quyen Pfeifer, Beth Burstein, Aliza Augustine, Hannah Kozak, and Sebastian Holzknecht disturb our senses by showing us subtle images of a past that it is still among us; they convince us that only our memory will help us avoid repeating the horrors of genocide.</p>

<p>And among these necessary testimonies, fine art emerges from the ashes of the past, with Jack Curran’s landscapes, Haydee Yordan and Lee Musgrave’s intriguing abstractions, Deb Young and Francisco Diaz’s depictions of the innocence of childhood  ritual, and Christofer Ruane’s black and white images that offer a surrealistic interpretation of the reality around us.</p>

Throughout October 2016 Berlin welcomes once again the largest German festival for photography, the 7th European Month of Photography. As Associated Partner of the EMOP Berlin the first edition of the Berlin Foto Biennale  - and 4th edition of the Biennial for Fine Art and Documentary Photography - will take place at the elegant Palazzo Italia, situated in the historic heart of Berlin, in a venue of 24,000 sq/mt. After Madrid, Buenos Aires and Malaga, Berlin was chosen as a new base to promote emerging talents and established artists from all over the world. Emotions and Commotions Across Cultures  will present 1230 photos by 446 contemporary artists from 41 countries of all continents – among them 65% women, who have been awarded in different editions of the Julia Margaret Cameron Award for Women Photographers .
The works represent a wide spectrum of styles ranging from documentary and wild life, to portrait and experimental photography. Recognizing a wide array of artistic expression across diverse cultures, the Biennial presents a contemporary overview of the different schools of thought emerging from the United States to China, from Australia to Turkey and from Senegal to Mexico.
The Biennial also contains selected works by Steve McCurry. His solo exhibition 'Retrospective' forms part of the Biennial as special invitee.

The works on display here showcase emotions that can be tricky to understand within ourselves, since many of them increase the likelihood of chaos and provoke a state of confused and noisy disturbance. Such are the images of “Disorder,” the portfolio of Andrea Star Reeves, which shows the abuse in mental institutions in Indonesia.

Such also are the images of Yusuke Suzuk chronicling the civil insurrection in Syria against a government that has transformed civilians into soldiers of the Syrian Free Army. Suzuki also puts us in a state of commotion by revealing the crisis facing immigrant families on the Island of Lesbos.

A group of photographers composed by Vienne Rea, Quyen Pfeifer, Beth Burstein, Aliza Augustine, Hannah Kozak, and Sebastian Holzknecht disturb our senses by showing us subtle images of a past that it is still among us; they convince us that only our memory will help us avoid repeating the horrors of genocide.

And among these necessary testimonies, fine art emerges from the ashes of the past, with Jack Curran’s landscapes, Haydee Yordan and Lee Musgrave’s intriguing abstractions, Deb Young and Francisco Diaz’s depictions of the innocence of childhood  ritual, and Christofer Ruane’s black and white images that offer a surrealistic interpretation of the reality around us.

</p><p><u><b>This Spring [INTERFACE] will go LIVE. JUNE 13th to 16th!!! Join us!!</b></u></p><p><u><br/></u></p><p><u>ABOUT THE PROJECT</u></p>
<p>Welcome to [INTERFACE] Edmonton. [INTERFACE] was
initiated by a duo of art advocates who have trained and worked locally and
internationally in the arts sector. Mo Ossobleh draws on his connection to activist groups and training with art advocacy organizations both locally and internationally,
and works as a visual artist himself. Justine Hartlieb-Power has developed the
tools to execute exhibitions from inception to installation, drawing on her internship
with the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, as well as training
with local organizations and non-profits. They both have developed the tools to
execute their exhibition with integrity and passion, and would like to invite
you to be a part of their effort. </p>
<p>While the exhibition itself is the brainchild of
Mo Ossobleh and Justine Hartlieb-Power, the project as a whole is comprised of
many other contributing artists, musicians and creative minds. Mo and Justine
currently live in Edmonton, and while they love their city, they recognize a
distinct lack of independently run exhibitions. They therefore hope to create a
space that not only challenges the way art is disseminated within their city,
but also challenges the way Edmontonians interact with their communities and
each other. Justine and Mo aim to be collaborative in both the execution of
this project as well as in the event itself, as community is an essential part
of their mandate.</p><p>By activating this project we seek to activate awareness on the systems of oppression that permeate our daily existence. In our effort in providing a safe space we must confront oppression collectively and it starts with recognizing that this land, Edmonton, sits on indigenous territory.  Through this awareness we may confront oppression and symptoms of colonization more effectively and honestly. <br/></p>
<p>“We at [INTERFACE] believe that art and community
are fundamental building blocks for any city, and we recognize that we cannot
execute our aims without the help of the greater Edmonton community.” </p>
<p><a href=""http://interface-edmonton.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://interface-edmonton.tumblr.com/</a><br/></p><p>Join us Edmonton! </p>
<p><u>Why us? Why [INTERFACE]?</u></p>
<p>Edmonton is a beautiful city, with depth and
passion intrinsic to its core. We recognize this at [INTERFACE], and we hope to
expand people’s perceptions of Edmonton through an exhibition that focuses on the
various ways in which technology has impeded or enhanced our ability to
interact with one another on a daily basis. </p>
<p>Community engagement is at the core of our
mandate. We aim to express this through an exclusively Edmonton based roster of
artists, all of whom recognize the artistic potential of this city and situate
their practice within this city. We are working with the Alberta Public Interest
and Research group, also known as APIRG (<a href=""http://apirg.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://apirg.org/</a>), to help create
a safe, inclusive environment! Thanks APIRG!!!</p>
<p>[INTERFACE] will also host a speaker series
during the exhibition. The [INTERFACE] forum is designed to create a dialogue
that honors the voice of our community, acting as a bridge whereby multiple,
seemingly disparate community sectors (art, politics, music and activism) can
debate the merits of our Third Spaces. We are hopeful that the forum will
generate a framework for sustained connections throughout our municipality. The
community will be engaged through a visual art exhibition, open forum, and
cross media performance (there’s live music!).</p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p><u>HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT [INTERFACE]?</u></p>
<p>[INTERFACE] is 100% self-initiated,
self-directed, and self-funded. While our passion for art and community is
insatiable, the fact that [INTERFACE] is both a self-directed and self-funded
program necessitates the community’s support in order for the project to reach
it’s full potential.</p><p><b>Recommended Donations at $10, equivalent to an entrance fee but YOU get to be a part of executing [INTERFACE] and providing FREE and ACCESSIBLE programming for the community.</b></p>
<p>There are many ways of supporting our project
beyond donating funds: volunteering time, sharing our page on social media so
as to expand the reach of our project, attending events, and just generally
visiting arts institutions and spaces throughout the city.</p>
<p><u>WHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?</u></p>
<p>In our effort to keep the programs free and
completely accessible to the public, we are asking our community to help
initiate our project, either by donating their time or their funds to our
campaign.</p>

Welcome to [INTERFACE] Edmonton. [INTERFACE] was
initiated by a duo of art advocates who have trained and worked locally and
internationally in the arts sector. Mo Ossobleh draws on his connection to activist groups and training with art advocacy organizations both locally and internationally,
and works as a visual artist himself. Justine Hartlieb-Power has developed the
tools to execute exhibitions from inception to installation, drawing on her internship
with the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, as well as training
with local organizations and non-profits. They both have developed the tools to
execute their exhibition with integrity and passion, and would like to invite
you to be a part of their effort. 
While the exhibition itself is the brainchild of
Mo Ossobleh and Justine Hartlieb-Power, the project as a whole is comprised of
many other contributing artists, musicians and creative minds. Mo and Justine
currently live in Edmonton, and while they love their city, they recognize a
distinct lack of independently run exhibitions. They therefore hope to create a
space that not only challenges the way art is disseminated within their city,
but also challenges the way Edmontonians interact with their communities and
each other. Justine and Mo aim to be collaborative in both the execution of
this project as well as in the event itself, as community is an essential part
of their mandate.By activating this project we seek to activate awareness on the systems of oppression that permeate our daily existence. In our effort in providing a safe space we must confront oppression collectively and it starts with recognizing that this land, Edmonton, sits on indigenous territory.  Through this awareness we may confront oppression and symptoms of colonization more effectively and honestly. 
“We at [INTERFACE] believe that art and community
are fundamental building blocks for any city, and we recognize that we cannot
execute our aims without the help of the greater Edmonton community.” 
http://interface-edmonton.tumblr.com/Join us Edmonton! 
Why us? Why [INTERFACE]?
Edmonton is a beautiful city, with depth and
passion intrinsic to its core. We recognize this at [INTERFACE], and we hope to
expand people’s perceptions of Edmonton through an exhibition that focuses on the
various ways in which technology has impeded or enhanced our ability to
interact with one another on a daily basis. 
Community engagement is at the core of our
mandate. We aim to express this through an exclusively Edmonton based roster of
artists, all of whom recognize the artistic potential of this city and situate
their practice within this city. We are working with the Alberta Public Interest
and Research group, also known as APIRG (http://apirg.org/), to help create
a safe, inclusive environment! Thanks APIRG!!!
[INTERFACE] will also host a speaker series
during the exhibition. The [INTERFACE] forum is designed to create a dialogue
that honors the voice of our community, acting as a bridge whereby multiple,
seemingly disparate community sectors (art, politics, music and activism) can
debate the merits of our Third Spaces. We are hopeful that the forum will
generate a framework for sustained connections throughout our municipality. The
community will be engaged through a visual art exhibition, open forum, and
cross media performance (there’s live music!).

HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT [INTERFACE]?
[INTERFACE] is 100% self-initiated,
self-directed, and self-funded. While our passion for art and community is
insatiable, the fact that [INTERFACE] is both a self-directed and self-funded
program necessitates the community’s support in order for the project to reach
it’s full potential.Recommended Donations at $10, equivalent to an entrance fee but YOU get to be a part of executing [INTERFACE] and providing FREE and ACCESSIBLE programming for the community.
There are many ways of supporting our project
beyond donating funds: volunteering time, sharing our page on social media so
as to expand the reach of our project, attending events, and just generally
visiting arts institutions and spaces throughout the city.
WHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?
In our effort to keep the programs free and
completely accessible to the public, we are asking our community to help
initiate our project, either by donating their time or their funds to our
campaign.
Funds raised through this platform will help to
cover the rental of the exhibition and forum site,

</h3> <p>Hey there! I'm Tamarakay, one of the founders of Dye with Dignity. My journey with the creation of art began during the 2011 burn (my first!) when I was conscripted into painting boobies at Barbie Death Camp for the Critical Tits bike ride. I'd never painted or thought I could, but ended up with a line of beautiful women wanting me to create beautiful designs on them! Back home after the burn there was a serious lack of people willing to disrobe for me, so I found silk. I dyed, painted, sewed, ripped to shreds and knit with, SILK. And the idea for Dye with Dignity was born. The next year we brought 300 scarves and 50 sarongs to the burn and helped that many people create their own work of art on Monday. Completely out of scarves our first day! It was exhilarating and exhausting. Tuesday while working my ice shift I saw several people in line with their silk scarves created at our camp wrapped around their faces as dust masks. My heart exploded. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>But let's face it. Silk is expensive. It's getting harder and harder for my husband and I to both afford the trip AND purchase the silk and dyes for our camp. That's where we need your help. Our camp mates and I have been busy these past few months creating gifts from our hands and hearts. We have painted, knit, sewed, embellished, and sculpted to reward you with unique from the heart gifts for your generous donations. Every penny raised in this campaign will be used to purchase silk, dyes, snow cone supplies, and wine. Mostly silk and dyes, cause that is our primary mission. Spread the love through the gift of creation and self expression! </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Our Website contains pictures from last year's dye event. The look on people's faces when they open up that silk and see what they created is the most amazing heart exploding gift I receive on the playa. I have received pictures and stories from burners who have gone back to their default lives and began creating art, and how being exposed to this art form at burning man was a turning point in their creative lives. Plus, let's face it, it's just a way cool thing to do in the desert!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Thank you for helping us spread the word! Please consider sharing this campaign through your favorite social media and help us get the word out about what we do and why. </p>
<p>Also, if you are at the burn and want to help out come on by! We always need more hands and hearts. Dye days include the Wheel of Shame, passing out umbrellas to those waiting in line, misting the line with cooling scented water, pouring juice and wine to thirsty passers by, making snow cones, stilt walkers, buskers, dye mixers, photographers, and table assistants. We have been told that standing in line at our camp was an adventure in and of itself! Dye With Dignity loves to spread the love! </p>

</div></div>","Hola, soy Lizeth León y este es mi proyecto Fachadas bogotanas.


Fachadas bogotanas integra la escritura y la ilustración para contar, a través de sus fachadas, las distintas formas de habitar Bogotá más allá de sus trayectos turísticos y los estereotipos que hay sobre ella.


Por eso, el 26 de enero de este año decidí que me dedicaría, por cuatro meses, a recorrer las veinte localidades de la ciudad, a dibujar a diario una fachada producto de esos recorridos, y a recoger historias y visiones de ciudad. Además, quise incluir en mi itinerario dos municipios, Soacha y Chía, como muestra del continuo proceso expansivo de Bogotá.




El libro 

La idea, desde el principio, fue hacer un libro con una selección de este material. Por eso, esta 'empresa fachada' no es solo mi proyecto, sino el de Fredy Ordóñez, amigo y editor. Con su ayuda, Fachadas bogotanas se convertirá en un libro y será el comienzo de Ediciones Milserifas, el proyecto de Fredy de crear una editorial de libros bonitos, cuidados, no costosos y hechos con mucho corazón, sin intermediarios entre los autores y sus lectores.


Fachadas bogotanas incluye una selección de 47 ilustraciones y pequeñas historias, además de siete textos con formas de leer a Bogotá a partir de la inagotable variedad de estilos de sus casas. Su formato será de 17x17, en tapa rústica, a cuatro tintas y con cerca de 160 páginas. El libro incluye, además, un mapa ilustrado de Bogotá.

<p>Hello! My name is Leonard Peng and I am a senior
illustration student at the Maryland Institute College of Art. “Small Creatures
Such Is We” is a collaborative gallery show featuring 15 talented MICA
illustrators. </p>
<p>This show is a collection of miniature compositions that offer
an intimate glimpse of a tiny world. Each image is 3"" x 3"" and
focuses on small moments distilled from the vastness of human experience. From
the extraordinary to the mundane, each image is a window into the realm of
people. We created this show with the hopes that viewers would enter as giants
among the illustrations, and would leave as small as the people in them.</p>
<p>We have created 750 of these 3x3 illustrations and they are
just waiting to be printed and hung in a fantastic gallery space at MICA.  Your funding will help make this show a
reality and allow you to enjoy it even if you do not live in the area.</p>

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>We are an international group of world-class Healing Arts teachers and practitioners dedicated to creating a more sustainable, compassionate and “life-serving” world.</p>
<p>We work in inspiring and empowering locations around the world with focus on community service. We offer trainings and retreats designed to support embodiment, quiet the mind and free the spirit in a field of holistic and preventative health care such as: Esalen® Massage certifications, wide range of bodywork, Holotropic™  breathwork, Yoga, SpiritDance, SoulSong, Gabrielle Roth's 5Rhythms™ dance, meditation, Neural Somatic Integration®, diet, permaculture, nutrition and more.</p>
<p>These movement forms provide a powerful catalyst for personal and collective transformation by raising awareness. The expanded perspective leads to a greater range of choice and assists us in going beyond our habitual patterns and limiting thoughts. The only requirements are curiosity, fascination, and permission to explore and experience new ways of moving, breathing and being.</p>
<p>While drawing students from many countries and backgrounds, we provide scholarships to local people in need. We teach them sustainable employment skills while fostering cross-cultural learning and appreciation that bridges racial, religious, economic and social differences. We offer a rich and varied integral learning environment devoted to cultivating deep change in self and society.</p>
<p><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to be of service by promoting personal and social transformation worldwide and to actualize those extraordinary capacities of “human potential”. that have been repressed by modern cultures We look beyond dogma to explore deeper spiritual possibilities, forge new understandings of self and society and pioneer new paths for change. We all have powerful capacities for evolving consciousness through self-inquiry, reflection, and relationship. When we take the time to realize and develop these capacities, we can transform our lives, communities, and the world.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THIS MONEY FOR</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $100,000.00 to establish our new Healing Arts location in Croatia. The money will help purchase a 36 feet event Dome, 15 massage tables, 50 yoga mats, 50 pillows, 5 tables, 50 chairs, sound equipment and supplies such as sheets, oils, lotions and other basic supplies.</p>
<p><strong>WHY CROATIA</strong></p>
<p>With over a thousand islands, rivers, waterfalls and numerous National Parks, the atmosphere and culture of the Dalmatian coast of Croatia provides a beautiful natural environment and serves as a place of refuge, reverence, healing and contemplation honoring nature as our source and greatest teacher. This fits perfectly with our intention to immerse ourselves into moving meditation practices as a path toward healing, self-exploration and transformation. We believe in the deeply transformative power of this place.</p>
<p>We want to offer scholarships for those still traumatized by violence from the recent war – Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian woman and man and help them overcome fear and anger and promote healing and forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>WHY SHOULD I SUPPORT THIS</strong></p>
<p>Human possibilities vastly exceed our imagination. Realization of the human potential transcends religious and scientific dogma. Mental, physical, emotional, spiritual, and social dimensions of our being are inextricably joined. Transformation of consciousness is the basis for transformation of the world; individually, collectively, and in social systems. All share the potential to love, learn, feel, and create.</p>
<p>By contributing to our program and helping fund this project, you will be personally invested in our project and perpetuating the healing arts.</p>
<p>The world needs those who believe in our common humanity, who understand and promote the development of all individuals and communities. We are extremely grateful for everyone supporting our mission and we hope to inspire other similar programs throughout the world.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in making a donation to our programs. It is through the generosity of friends like you that we can continue our mission of developing human potential.</p>

It would be the opportunity of a lifetime!   Your Compensation In order to raise $600 by the up and coming deadline, I am willing to take commissions (kids, portraits, families, pets, etc)! These will be completed by no later than the end of September. I will individually contact all the donors to about their artistic requests. (:  
$5-$20- Drawing  $21-$50- Watercolor or drawing Over $50- Oil, watercolor, or drawing 
Over $100- WHATEVER U WANT, REALLY 4REAL 
The Impact The experience of attending a college level art camp will help me grow as an artist, expose me to the college experience, and help further develop my portfolio! (:  Risks & Challenges I'm risky.I learned I've got one week as of today, but with your help, we can pull this off!

<h1>What is Strewth SLS?</h1>
<p>The Strewth SLS is the natural evolution of the original ""Step-In"" snowboard bindings, combining the ease and speed of a step-in with the performance and feel of a traditional two strap binding.. </p>
<p>For those who don't know, ""step-in"" snowboard bindings were popular in the mid 90's. The advantage of these bindings was you could just step in and ride, without having to stop and strap in before every run.</p>
<p>The original ""step-ins"" weren't very good for performance though, and used specialised stiff boots. Although they had great potential for improvement, these early models were never developed further and eventually all were discontinued.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p></strong></h1><h1><strong>Our Inspiration</strong></h1>
<p>A lot of riders loved the step-ins, and while they are not available on the market today we believe there is still a demand for a high quality, high performance, step-in binding.</p>
<p>The majority of snowboarders today swear that only traditional two strap bindings provide the best in feel &amp; performance, and we agree! </p>
<p>After trying all the current offerings on the market, including the “rear-entry” bindings such as Flow’s or Fastecs, we found there was nothing that met our desire for a high performance binding with the speed and ease of a step-in.</p>
<p>As nobody was making the bindings we wanted we realised we would have to do it ourselves, and set out to design the ultimate high performance step-in binding. After several years of designs, revisions and prototypes the end result is the Strewth SLS.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/791754/files/20140816062244-strewth__4179.jpg?1408195364"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>
<h1><strong>How Does It Work</strong></h1>
<p>The Strewth SLS provides step-in functionality in a traditional two strap binding by using your body weight to automatcally close and lock the binding.</p>
<p>As you place your boot in the binding and press down on the footbed, the ankle strap is automatically tightened, the Hi-Back returns to the closed position, and the binding is automatically locked.</p>
<p>All this happens in an instant allowing you to ride straight from the lift without stopping &amp; often without even looking down.</p>
<p>The straps return to your preset tension every time. Set your straps once at the start of the day and don't touch them again. </p>
<p>Due to the leverage created in the system, only a small amount of pressure is required on the baseplate to close and lock the binding, even with the tightest strap settings. This is especially useful in powder, and ensures easy entry anywhere on the mountain.</p>
<p>Exit is via a simple flick of the release lever.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/791757/files/20140816062324-strewth__4204.jpg?1408195404"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><br/><p></p>
<h1><strong>Strewth Advantages</strong></h1>
<p>The ability to step into your bindings and ride away without bending down to tighten straps is the most obvious advantage of the Strewth SLS. This means more time riding, more powder, and no more sitting down to strap in. </p>
<p>Riders of other speed entry systems, such as Flow, GNU/Fastech, or K2 Cinch will know that while these bindings offer some convenience when on flat hard packed snow, they can be extremely difficult to enter on steep slopes and deep snow. This is due to the clearance required for the opening hiback and the cable locking mechanism attached to the hiback. On steep slopes and deep snow these bindings become far more difficult to enter than traditional strap bindings, therefore losing the benefit of the speed entry system.</p>
<p>With the Strewth SLS we have removed the limitations of the existing ""speed entry"" systems, meaning you can step-in effortlessly anywhere on the mountain, even on the steepest slopes and deepest snow.</p>
<p>The Strewth SLS is the only binding providing a truly automatic ""hands free"" step-in entry system ! </p>
<p>""A game changer in snowboard binding technology!""</p>

<h1><strong>Reliability and Quality</strong></h1>
<p>Reliability and quality has been a key focus for us from day one. </p>
<p>Although it sounds complicated, the design has been kept simple with a minimum number of moving parts. We have also removed the majority of nuts and screws found in other bindings. Losing a screw has been the ruin of many a great day on the hill, and the best warranty in the world won't save you when you're stuck on top of a mountain. We use permanent fasteners to ensure you are not let down when it matters most.</p>
<p>Our bases are made of the highest grade glass infused nylons for maximum strength and minimum weight. </p>
<p>Our heel-cups are made only from the strongest aircraft grade aluminum. No crappy plastic heel-cups here!</p>
<p>To ensure the best reliability and quality, we have been working closely with some of the best snowboard designers in the business and have partnered with one of the largest binding factories (who currently make bindings for many of the biggest brands) to ensure Strewth bindings are manufactured to the highest possible standards.  </p>
<p>We are 100% committed to building our bindings to perform day in day out, season after season! </p>

</p><h1>Where we're at now, and why we need your help.</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We have built and tested our functional prototypes (seen in the video) and are now ready to move into the production design phase. This next phase involves working with the factories to make the final design modifications, and to build the molds and tools required to manufacture the bindings. The outcome of this phase will be the first production run of Strewth bindings for our Indiegogo backers.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help fund:</p>
<p>- Production tooling <br/>- Production prototyping and testing<br/>- Initial Production Run</p>
<p>The cost of making the tools and molds needed for production is high, and our goal for this campaign is to help cover these costs, and to meet the minimum order numbers required for our first production run of Strewth  bindings.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help us fund these costs and get Strewth bindings into production and onto the mountains.</p>
<p>In reward for your help you will be among the first to be riding Strewth bindings, a whole year before everyone else! Be first to every powder stash next season, while everyone else is still strapping in!</p>

</p><h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Strewth Snowboards is a startup company based in Sydney Australia, purely focused on the advancement of snowboarding through innovative and high performance product design. </p>
<p>Our initial product, the Strewth SLS binding, is in response to all those riders looking for a better binding system. When we started out snowboarding in the mid 90's, step-in bindings were just starting to explode onto the market, and having ridden step-ins for several years, especially the Switch X system, it was clear these held great potential, but more development was needed. </p>
<p>Ultimately cost, compatability issues, weight, and problems with performance caused the demise of step-in bindings, and as the major snowboard companies chose to focus on traditional two strap bindings all step-in lines were eventually discontinued.</p>
<p>This began the search for a better binding and endless nights creating rough prototypes out of old binding parts, creating and discarding concepts, until finally perfecting what is now the Strewth SLS system.</p>
<p>With a solid concept ready for further development we searched out some of the best industrial designers and snowboard designers to help turn the idea into the Strewth SLS prototype you see today.</p>
<p>Ultimately the Strewth SLS is the result of one riders obsession over almost 10 years and the skill and generosity of several talented designers and snowboarders who have helped out along the way.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>Below are some frequently asked questions. Feel free to contact us with any more questions you have and we will add them to the list below.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use standard snowboard boots with Strewth bindings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Strewth Bindings are just like any standard two-strap binding when <br/>riding. You can use any standard snowboard boot with your Strewth <br/>Bindings.</p>
<p><strong>Are the bindings heavy?</strong></p>
<p>No. The bindings are made from the same materials as most high-end <br/>snowboard bindings, ie; Glass infused nylons, and aircraft grade <br/>aluminium. Plus we have cored out our baseplates to remove any excess <br/>material. Strewth bindings are equivalent in weight to the lighter <br/>bindings on the market today.</p>
<p><strong>Are the bindings affected by snow clogging or jamming?</strong></p>
<p>No. Addressing the issue of snow clogging has been a core driver in the <br/>design from day one. We have insured there is no part of the binding <br/>affected by snow clogging. An amount of snow will always enter any <br/>binding, and we have allowed for this to ensure the binding is <br/>not affected by snow entering the binding.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use the straps like a standard binding?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The binding has standard straps and ratchets. If you want to, you can use <br/>the straps and ratchets just like a normal binding, however we doubt you will ever want to.</p>
<p><strong>I like my straps really tight. Will I need to use more force to enter or exit </strong><br/><strong>the bindings if I have my straps set super tight?</strong></p>
<p>No. This is one of the key features of the system. Due to the leverage <br/>created in the strap system, no matter how tight your straps are set <br/>you will only need minimal pressure on the baseplate to lock the binding. <br/>This is especially useful in powder!</p>
<p><strong>How does the performance &amp; flex compare to other bindings on the market.</strong></p>
<p>The binding performance is equal to any top-end binding available. The <br/>flex for this model is a stiffer flex, aimed more towards all mountain <br/>performance.</p>
<p><strong>Where and when can I get a pair?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, this IndieGoGo campaign is the only place you can get them, <br/>and only up until February 28th. After that the bindings will be in stores for the 2014-15 season. <strong>Put your pledge in now and don't miss out!</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is Indiegogo.com?</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo.com is a fund raising platform for creative projects. Every day people with new ideas and products are creating campaigns and raising the funds needed to make thier dreams a reality.</p>
<p>This new type of funding is often referred to as ""crowdfunding"". There are several websites such as Indiegogo, Kickstarter, and Rockethub dedictaed to crowdfunding new and exciting projects.</p>
<p>The traditional methods of funding startup projects are loans provided by banks, or venture capitalists making large investments. These types of funding are simply not viable for many smaller projects and therefore crowdfunding is making these projects possible.</p>
<p>Thousands of new projects and products have been launched via this innovative new fund raising movement. A browse through the Indiegogo or Kickstarter websites will show the types of successes so far.</p>
<p><strong>Why do people back projects?</strong></p>
<p>People contribute to projects for many reasons, but usually it’s because they want to be involved in what the project is doing or because they want the perks that are part of the campaign. Backing a project is more than just giving someone money, it's supporting their dream to create something that they want to see exist in the world.</p>
<p>When you pledge your support for a project you are not ""buying a product"" but providing your support to help the project creators achieve thier goals. The reward for your support is the Perk you have nominated when making your contribution.</p>
<p>A successful project is a win/win for everyone involved. A realised dream for the project creator, and a reward (Perk) for the backer and satisfaction of being part of creating something new. The most succesful projects are those where the creator and backers share a common passion or interest and both have a desire to see this new idea become reality.</p>
<p>The Strewth project is for everyone who shares a passion for snowboarding. If you were an old step-in user and have longed for thier return, or are just a rider who wants a better binding system, now is your chance to have an impact. We need your support to help make this project a success and to take this exciting new binding technology onto mountains worldwide! Thank you.</p></div>","This campaign is now closed.

Where we're at now, and why we need your help.

We have built and tested our functional prototypes (seen in the video) and are now ready to move into the production design phase. This next phase involves working with the factories to make the final design modifications, and to build the molds and tools required to manufacture the bindings. The outcome of this phase will be the first production run of Strewth bindings for our Indiegogo backers.
Your contributions will help fund:
- Production tooling - Production prototyping and testing- Initial Production Run
The cost of making the tools and molds needed for production is high, and our goal for this campaign is to help cover these costs, and to meet the minimum order numbers required for our first production run of Strewth  bindings.
Your contributions will help us fund these costs and get Strewth bindings into production and onto the mountains.
In reward for your help you will be among the first to be riding Strewth bindings, a whole year before everyone else! Be first to every powder stash next season, while everyone else is still strapping in!

About Us
Strewth Snowboards is a startup company based in Sydney Australia, purely focused on the advancement of snowboarding through innovative and high performance product design. 
Our initial product, the Strewth SLS binding, is in response to all those riders looking for a better binding system. When we started out snowboarding in the mid 90's, step-in bindings were just starting to explode onto the market, and having ridden step-ins for several years, especially the Switch X system, it was clear these held great potential, but more development was needed. 
Ultimately cost, compatability issues, weight, and problems with performance caused the demise of step-in bindings, and as the major snowboard companies chose to focus on traditional two strap bindings all step-in lines were eventually discontinued.
This began the search for a better binding and endless nights creating rough prototypes out of old binding parts, creating and discarding concepts, until finally perfecting what is now the Strewth SLS system.
With a solid concept ready for further development we searched out some of the best industrial designers and snowboard designers to help turn the idea into the Strewth SLS prototype you see today.
Ultimately the Strewth SLS is the result of one riders obsession over almost 10 years and the skill and generosity of several talented designers and snowboarders who have helped out along the way.

FAQ
Below are some frequently asked questions. Feel free to contact us with any more questions you have and we will add them to the list below.
Can I use standard snowboard boots with Strewth bindings?
Yes. Strewth Bindings are just like any standard two-strap binding when riding. You can use any standard snowboard boot with your Strewth Bindings.
Are the bindings heavy?
No. The bindings are made from the same materials as most high-end snowboard bindings, ie; Glass infused nylons, and aircraft grade aluminium. Plus we have cored out our baseplates to remove any excess material. Strewth bindings are equivalent in weight to the lighter bindings on the market today.
Are the bindings affected by snow clogging or jamming?
No. Addressing the issue of snow clogging has been a core driver in the design from day one. We have insured there is no part of the binding affected by snow clogging. An amount of snow will always enter any binding, and we have allowed for this to ensure the binding is not affected by snow entering the binding.
Can I use the straps like a standard binding?
Yes. The binding has standard straps and ratchets. If you want to, you can use the straps and ratchets just like a normal binding, however we doubt you will ever want to.
I like my straps really tight. Will I need to use more force to enter or exit the bindings if I have my straps set super tight?
No. This is one of the key features of the system. Due to the leverage created in the strap system, no matter how tight your straps are set you will only need minimal pressure on the baseplate to lock the binding. This is especially useful in powder!
How does the performance & flex compare to other bindings on the market.
The binding performance is equal to any top-end binding available. The flex for this model is a stiffer flex, aimed more towards all mountain performance.
Where and when can I get a pair?
At the moment, this IndieGoGo campaign is the only place you can get them, and only up until February 28th. After that the bindings will be in stores for the 2014-15 season. Put your pledge in now and don't miss out!
  
 

 
 
What is Indiegogo.com?
Indiegogo.com is a fund raising platform for creative projects. Every day people with new ideas and products are creating campaigns and raising the funds needed to make thier dreams a reality.
This new type of funding is often referred to as ""crowdfunding"". There are several websites such as Indiegogo, Kickstarter, and Rockethub dedictaed to crowdfunding new and exciting projects.
The traditional methods of funding startup projects are loans provided by banks, or venture capitalists making large investments. These types of funding are simply not viable for many smaller projects and therefore crowdfunding is making these projects possible.
Thousands of new projects and products have been launched via this innovative new fund raising movement. A browse through the Indiegogo or Kickstarter websites will show the types of successes so far.
Why do people back projects?
People contribute to projects for many reasons, but usually it’s because they want to be involved in what the project is doing or because they want the perks that are part of the campaign. Backing a project is more than just giving someone money, it's supporting their dream to create something that they want to see exist in the world.
When you pledge your support for a project you are not ""buying a product"" but providing your support to help the project creators achieve thier goals. The reward for your support is the Perk you have nominated when making your contribution.
A successful project is a win/win for everyone involved. A realised dream for the project creator, and a reward (Perk) for the backer and satisfaction of being part of creating something new. The most succesful projects are those where the creator and backers share a common passion or interest and both have a desire to see this new idea become reality.
The Strewth project is for everyone who shares a passion for snowboarding. If you were an old step-in user and have longed for thier return, or are just a rider who wants a better binding system, now is your chance to have an impact. We need your support to help make this project a success and to take this exciting new binding technology onto mountains worldwide! Thank you.",13.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I realize it will take some sacrificng to get my business going. We as a society have come a long way from paper, crayons, pens and colored pencils. Now everything has become digital.

Giving the client the power to print the artwork themselves or have it printed elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Color Exchange is an interactive, site-specific mural and
performance installation that illustrates the importance of communication. We are thrilled to have been accepted as artist representatives at the Build Peace Conference in Nicosia, Cyprus (<a href=""http://www.buildpeace.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.buildpeace.org</a>). Artists <a href=""http://www.nadiawestcott.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nadia Westcott</a> and <a href=""http://www.soleiarts.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Solei</a> will be completing this mural project there in April 2015. </p><p><b>How does it work?</b></p><p>This
piece of art invites the public to participate in the visual outcome of the
mural through participating in a question and answer game with other passerby.
In front of the mural, we will set up a table and two chairs. This recalls
connotations of diplomacy and negotiation, but also family and domesticity. On
the table will be displayed a deck of uniquely colored cards. Each card will
contain one color and question, to be discussed between the two participants.
We will invite participants (preferably strangers) to sit and each pick a card
and then discuss. We will deliberately choose a question that are universal,
encouraging people to look beyond the current conflict and focusing on our
shared humanity. Here is a short list of questions we will include:</p><p>-Do you prefer music that makes you think or music that makes you dance?</p><p>-Garden or forest?</p><p>-First thing you thought about when you woke up today?</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">-Ocean or pool?</span><br/></p><p>-Strangest dream you've ever had?</p><p>-Bridge or boat?</p><p>-Favorite meal: Now? / As a kid?</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291008/files/20150312170359-Card_Design_Proposal.JPG?1426205039"" src="""" style=""width: 524.970760233918px; height: 382px;""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">After the conversation is finished, we will combine the
colors of the cards they chose to form a new color. This new color will
symbolize a novel connection between two previously unconnected people.  We will then use that color to fill a new
space in our mural design. The conversations and mural creation will be
simultaneous, so that people will be able to see the mural take shape before
their very eyes.  Our goal will be to have
50 conversations, which inspire 50 new colors to create the mural. In this way,
participants are creating a mural through conversation.</span></p>
<p>The design will be inspired by a city map aesthetic. It will
be original and abstract, but will intentionally remind people of city
planning, maps and occupation of space. This will serve as the skeleton for the
participants’ creation. The design will be broken up into 50 “sections”, and
each section will be numbered so that the creation has an intentional direction
of progress. Mimicking the organic growth of urban landscape, the image will
progress from the inside, out. It will be an illustration of what we can create
through conversation. We hope this will inspire people to value social acts and
empower them to pursue them more often in everyday life.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291010/files/20150312170450-Sketch_Build_Peace.jpg?1426205090"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>This is an experience that will be unique to Nicosia, but we
intend to share it with a larger audience through the use of time lapse video.
We will document the entire process and use technology to share the creation on

</div>","The Color Exchange
The Color Exchange is an interactive, site-specific mural and
performance installation that illustrates the importance of communication. We are thrilled to have been accepted as artist representatives at the Build Peace Conference in Nicosia, Cyprus (www.buildpeace.org). Artists Nadia Westcott and Solei will be completing this mural project there in April 2015. How does it work?This
piece of art invites the public to participate in the visual outcome of the
mural through participating in a question and answer game with other passerby.
In front of the mural, we will set up a table and two chairs. This recalls
connotations of diplomacy and negotiation, but also family and domesticity. On
the table will be displayed a deck of uniquely colored cards. Each card will
contain one color and question, to be discussed between the two participants.
We will invite participants (preferably strangers) to sit and each pick a card
and then discuss. We will deliberately choose a question that are universal,
encouraging people to look beyond the current conflict and focusing on our
shared humanity. Here is a short list of questions we will include:-Do you prefer music that makes you think or music that makes you dance?-Garden or forest?-First thing you thought about when you woke up today?-Ocean or pool?-Strangest dream you've ever had?-Bridge or boat?-Favorite meal: Now? / As a kid?After the conversation is finished, we will combine the
colors of the cards they chose to form a new color. This new color will
symbolize a novel connection between two previously unconnected people.  We will then use that color to fill a new
space in our mural design. The conversations and mural creation will be
simultaneous, so that people will be able to see the mural take shape before
their very eyes.  Our goal will be to have
50 conversations, which inspire 50 new colors to create the mural. In this way,
participants are creating a mural through conversation.
The design will be inspired by a city map aesthetic. It will
be original and abstract, but will intentionally remind people of city
planning, maps and occupation of space. This will serve as the skeleton for the
participants’ creation. The design will be broken up into 50 “sections”, and
each section will be numbered so that the creation has an intentional direction
of progress. Mimicking the organic growth of urban landscape, the image will
progress from the inside, out. It will be an illustration of what we can create
through conversation. We hope this will inspire people to value social acts and
empower them to pursue them more often in everyday life.
This is an experience that will be unique to Nicosia, but we
intend to share it with a larger audience through the use of time lapse video.
We will document the entire process and use technology to share the creation on
a global scale. What will we use the money for?The Build Peace Conference has provided for our lodging and materials while we are there. The money raised in this campaign will go directly to our travel expenses (approximately $1,000 per person).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Ruben Murguia, I'm the director of a new organization (we're working on becoming a non-profit) called Siervos Por Amor (Servants For Love). We have a passion for transformation, starting with our native city of Juarez, Mexico. However we're focusing our aim higher to change the world through acts of love. Our goal is to bring hope to where there is none, happiness to where there is only sorrow and bringing a smile to the face of a child that has lost all hope of a future, at least a bright one that is. </p>
<p>We are looking for $100,000 dollars so that we can fully start operating all the areas in the ministry plus a couple of projects that will impact directly at the very least 5,000 people in the first year alone. <br/><br/>We are doing this because we know that in order to bring transformation to a city, it's important to act with the characteristics of Christ at all times. This will allow us to positively impact and change many lives through our everyday actions.</p>
<p>With the donations, our first priority is to jumpstart a couple of business ideas so that we can start generating our own income for the years to come. After that we'll be looking to fully fund at least two children festivals for 1,000 children each. These festivals will be set around Christmas time so we'll be looking at introducing the children tu the true meaning of Christmas through games, companionship, and skits that will speak to their hearts. Included in the money set aside for the festivals, is 6 months of follow up for 100 children that have been affected because of the violence that once was here. We'll be helping them with school supplies, food for their families once a month and a <span>psychologist if necessary. <br/><br/>After all of this has been met, we'll direct whatever money is left towards two goals. The first goal is to rent offices for Siervos Por Amor for one yearas well as focus on generating salaries for at least 4 of the main people in this ministry. The second goal focuses towards the </span>revitalization of one public park in the city through painting and maintenance, which would include organizing a weekly cleanup service. <span><br/><br/><strong>All of this without forgetting about giving our offerings at the 11 churches that are now represented in the ministry.</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$35,000 OF THE FUNDS ARE GOING TOWARDS HELPING THE CHILDREN THROUGH THE FESTIVALS AND FOR THE PARK MAINTENANCE<br/><br/>$27,000 IS GOING DIRECTLY TOWARDS BUSINESS STARTUPS FOR THE MNISTRY TO GENERATE ITS OWN MONEY<br/><br/>$28,000 GOES TOWARDS OFFICE RENT AND STAFF PAY.<br/><br/>10% FOR OFFERINGS<br/><br/>AND WHATEVER IS LEFT WILL BE USED FOR MORE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE IN MIND.<br/><br/><br/></p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of $100,000 we'll start with whatever we can in the following order.<br/><br/>1.- Offerings<br/>2.- Business startup<br/>3.- Festivals<br/>4.- Office and staff salaries<br/>5.- Park maintenance<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The full impact is something that is priceless...

</div></span></div>","Short Summary
My name is Ruben Murguia, I'm the director of a new organization (we're working on becoming a non-profit) called Siervos Por Amor (Servants For Love). We have a passion for transformation, starting with our native city of Juarez, Mexico. However we're focusing our aim higher to change the world through acts of love. Our goal is to bring hope to where there is none, happiness to where there is only sorrow and bringing a smile to the face of a child that has lost all hope of a future, at least a bright one that is. 
We are looking for $100,000 dollars so that we can fully start operating all the areas in the ministry plus a couple of projects that will impact directly at the very least 5,000 people in the first year alone. We are doing this because we know that in order to bring transformation to a city, it's important to act with the characteristics of Christ at all times. This will allow us to positively impact and change many lives through our everyday actions.
With the donations, our first priority is to jumpstart a couple of business ideas so that we can start generating our own income for the years to come. After that we'll be looking to fully fund at least two children festivals for 1,000 children each. These festivals will be set around Christmas time so we'll be looking at introducing the children tu the true meaning of Christmas through games, companionship, and skits that will speak to their hearts. Included in the money set aside for the festivals, is 6 months of follow up for 100 children that have been affected because of the violence that once was here. We'll be helping them with school supplies, food for their families once a month and a psychologist if necessary. After all of this has been met, we'll direct whatever money is left towards two goals. The first goal is to rent offices for Siervos Por Amor for one yearas well as focus on generating salaries for at least 4 of the main people in this ministry. The second goal focuses towards the revitalization of one public park in the city through painting and maintenance, which would include organizing a weekly cleanup service. All of this without forgetting about giving our offerings at the 11 churches that are now represented in the ministry.


What We Need & What You Get
$35,000 OF THE FUNDS ARE GOING TOWARDS HELPING THE CHILDREN THROUGH THE FESTIVALS AND FOR THE PARK MAINTENANCE$27,000 IS GOING DIRECTLY TOWARDS BUSINESS STARTUPS FOR THE MNISTRY TO GENERATE ITS OWN MONEY$28,000 GOES TOWARDS OFFICE RENT AND STAFF PAY.10% FOR OFFERINGSAND WHATEVER IS LEFT WILL BE USED FOR MORE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE IN MIND.
If we don't reach our goal of $100,000 we'll start with whatever we can in the following order.1.- Offerings2.- Business startup3.- Festivals4.- Office and staff salaries5.- Park maintenance


The Impact
The full impact is something that is priceless... It fully means that you're helping a ministry to do its job at reaching the lost in all the ways that are possible and opening the possibility in their hearts to tranform their lifes so that they can become beacons of hope, happines, and of God's love for the world. 
Included in all the perks ONLY if you specifically ask for it, we can send you the statements once a month about how we are using the money that we recieved. We want to make it as clear as possible that we are using the money as we said we would and hoping that this will generate more trust towards us and open doors a little more towards future campaigns if they are necessary.

<p><strong>1. WHAT IS CAPOEIRA?</strong></p>
<p>Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian form of martial art/dance engaged in at clubs, schools and on the streets. A sport involving intense physical training, it incorporates music, dance and combative movements, fascinating in beauty and form. The game takes place in a <em>roda</em> (circle) formed by the students and involves two players who try to outwit each other through a physical dialog using a combination of kicks, takedowns, escapes and acrobatics, which are wonderfully fluid in appearance.</p>
<p>There are no hard and fast rules, yet capoeira does follow a characteristic protocol, along with having its own music – perhaps its most enduring feature. Through learning the songs of capoeira, students also gain access to learning a new language (Portuguese), instruments and Brazilian history. By binding together these elements of sport, music, dance, martial skills and camaraderie, capoeira comprises one of the richest manifestations of Brazilian culture.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 WHO ARE WE?</strong></p>
<p>We are the Westchester County chapter of the capoeira group Cordão de Ouro. Professor Cabeção, who has been practicing for 16 years under the supervision of Mestre Esquilo, has been offering classes in Tarrytown and Ossining since January 2012. This will be the second batizado for Professor Cabeção’s group in the area.</p>
<p><strong>2. WHAT IS A BATIZADO?</strong></p>
<p>A capoeira batizado is an event that brings capoeiristas from all over the world together with other athletes, fans of sports, art and music, along with friends and family of the local group members to participate in and enjoy workshops, performances and celebrations organized with the intention of promoting capoeira, as well as all elements of music, culture, health, dance and the arts in the area. The purpose of the batizado ceremony is to deliver the first cord (the equivalent of a belt in other martial arts) to the students of the local group. In order to perform this ceremony, the presence of a capoeira Mestre is essential. Numerous capoeira professionals are called to assist in the organization of the ceremony (to play instruments, sing, graduate the students, etc.). The students are involved not only in promoting capoeira and demonstrating what they have learned over the course of their training for the capoeira community, friends and family, but also in elevating the name and image of the city and surrounding areas through capoeira. We also see this event as an opportunity to stimulate activity in the area and bring residents more art, culture, entertainment, health, music and everything associated with capoeira. With each event we grow, both individually and as a group, and improve the quality of our own capoeira and the quality of our local capoeira group.</p>

<p><strong>4. OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>We are promoting an event with our students in order to celebrate our work in the area and to bring capoeira practitioners, friends, family and the public to join us in celebration, to enjoy entertainment and culture, and to share our enthusiasm for our existence as a group. We intend to publicize our work related to capoeira, culture, education, and health, along with the work of others in the area who share these values. We are working to bring two people who are recognized and valued in the capoeira community for their importance and talent, in order to enhance the event and attract more practitioners and the community to come to learn more about capoeira, participate in the proposed activities, and ultimately to mobilize more people and to bring an exceptional quality to the information and activities to be presented at the event.</p>
<p>Please contact us if you would like more information regarding our proposal to bring Contra-Mestre Eurico. Eurico Vianna is working on a PhD in Sociology at Griffith University in Australia and has been a junior level master of capoeira since 2004. Throughout his career in capoeira and his academic studies he has given numerous lectures, written articles and a book, participated in documentaries and international projects involving the use of capoeira as a tool for social inclusion. He would like to come to help us with our event, and has offered to give lectures or workshops at other locations in the area to cover his travel expenses.</p>
<p><strong>5. JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>This event is essential in order to reward the efforts of the students who have been training and preparing to graduate, and through a great ceremony or event, to celebrate while bringing different activities such as capoeira to the area. The event will encourage others in the area with similar work and ideals to come together, and magnify the name and image of the city and locale through capoeira, thus allowing us to develop resources that will aid in our growth, to satisfy the public, and to always be able to bring entertainment, culture, art, health and quality to the area, and to be able to disseminate and develop projects here similar to various projects that already exist in Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>6. SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous ways to become involved and show support for our event. Below is a list of our needs and estimated expenses your donation will be used for.</p>
<p>  $3,000 – travel expenses (flight, housing, food, etc.) for Mestres (Masters) and distinguished visitors.</p>
<p>  $1,000 – instructors’ fees for workshops ($200 per workshop, 5 workshops)</p>
<p>  $700 – for approximately 180 t-shirts (2 colors, front and back)</p>
<p>  $200 – marketing material (posters, flyers, signs) </p>
<p>  $100 – other expenses (yarn to make the cords, water for participants at the event, etc.)</p>
<p>We are open to discussing any other arrangements (i.e. donating food, space, t-shirts, marketing material, etc.) that would assist in the organization of our event. Anyone who would be interested in setting up a table at the event to sell or advertise products/services to participants and event guests can contact us.</p>

<p><i>We are a new organization whose mission is to help veterans realize their dreams of working in the arts and we are incredibly excited about our first project; a series of plays written, created, and performed by </i><b><i>real military veterans</i></b><i> and those who are close to them.</i><br/></p>
<p><em><strong><em><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT</strong></em>:</strong></em></p>
<p><span><i>Beyond the Deserts &amp; Mountains</i> is a compilation of plays that aims to bring to light the humanity behind the eyes of the men &amp; women defending this country. There have been many stories told about the hardships of war but not many about the humanity of war. These stories shine a light on some of the issues that the men &amp; women of the Armed Forces are faced with while protecting our freedom and are told through the voices of those who have experienced these situations.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>The compilation includes three plays written by our Co-Founder and Iraq War veteran, Neath Williams, which tackle multiple issues present throughout military history including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), sexual harassment, and suicide. It also includes <i>Deployed</i>, a musical written by former Army veteran spouse and BMI Musical Theater Workshop alum, Natalie Lovejoy, about an infantry unit's deployment to Iraq as seen through the eyes of a young private.</span></p>
<p>In addition to the writers having military backgrounds, veterans will also be involved throughout the cast and creative team. A detailed description of the plays and those involved is included below.</p></span><p></p>
<br/><p><strong><em>OUR GOAL:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Our goal is to raise $5,000 in order to bring these new works to life in the Off-Off Broadway world of New York City. Y<span><strong><em>our donations will go toward the performance space, advertisements, web development, <strong><em><strong><em>programs, </em></strong></em></strong>copying costs, costumes, props, &amp; set construction. </em></strong></span>Without your help this will not be possible.

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></div>","We are a new organization whose mission is to help veterans realize their dreams of working in the arts and we are incredibly excited about our first project; a series of plays written, created, and performed by real military veterans and those who are close to them.
ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Beyond the Deserts & Mountains is a compilation of plays that aims to bring to light the humanity behind the eyes of the men & women defending this country. There have been many stories told about the hardships of war but not many about the humanity of war. These stories shine a light on some of the issues that the men & women of the Armed Forces are faced with while protecting our freedom and are told through the voices of those who have experienced these situations.

The compilation includes three plays written by our Co-Founder and Iraq War veteran, Neath Williams, which tackle multiple issues present throughout military history including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), sexual harassment, and suicide. It also includes Deployed, a musical written by former Army veteran spouse and BMI Musical Theater Workshop alum, Natalie Lovejoy, about an infantry unit's deployment to Iraq as seen through the eyes of a young private.
In addition to the writers having military backgrounds, veterans will also be involved throughout the cast and creative team. A detailed description of the plays and those involved is included below.
OUR GOAL:

Our goal is to raise $5,000 in order to bring these new works to life in the Off-Off Broadway world of New York City. Your donations will go toward the performance space, advertisements, web development, programs, copying costs, costumes, props, & set construction. Without your help this will not be possible. Also, your donation is tax-deductible!
In addition to donating, PLEASE spread the word that there are veterans out there making art by sharing one of our pages online.
Thank you so much for truly supporting those who have served!!!





This will be the first of many productions to come in the future plus when you donate it's tax deductible!!!! In addition to donating we ask that you spread the word about our cause. Share one of our pages online or simply tell a friend there are veterans out there making art!Discredited -  ""A glimpse into the disturbing and complicated
topic of sexual assault in the military.""
