Either Sodium-Gated or Calcium-Gated Ion Channels in the Plasma Membrane generate the electrical action potentials in human cells. Pain medicine and herbal remedies reduce the effectiveness of these ion channels to pass the electrical signal, thus reducing the intensity of the pain and other signals to and from your brain. Reducing these signals to very low levels by overdosing on pain medicine can cause death. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Pain Relief using Drugs and Procedures</strong></p><p>Many different types of professionals and non-professionals treat pain. </p><p>Chiropractors, Massage Therapists and Holistic Practitioners use various body manipulations, creams, rubs, heat, vibration, Acupuncture, braces, shoe inserts, magnets, herbal serums and supplements in an attempt to relieve the pain symptoms and possibly the source of the pain. Mainstream medicine uses drugs and procedures in an attempt to accomplish the same results.</p><p>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Acetaminophen (NSAIDs), Anti-Depressants, Anti-Convulsants (Anti-seizure) Medications, Muscle Relaxants and Opioids are all examples of drugs that dumb down these natural signals in your body.

Anytime I play sports or work in the yard I can barely walk the next day and I have tried every pain remedy on the market including orthopedics, painkillers, inserts, you name it. Nothing has relieved the pain like the nCAP Pain Relief Patch. After working 8 hours in my yard one weekend I wore the patch to bed and I woke up the next morning with no pain in my feet. This is the best pain relief product hands down. I'm a customer for life."" Jay, 33 years oldTake Your Life Back!  The Boring (but cool) Technical Details of How it Works - The Body's Neural NetworkThe human body is operated by electricity; this electricity is generated from chemical reactions within our cells. Very tiny electrical signals pass from one cell to another through a neural network comprised of Dendrites, Axons and the Synapse Gap between the two. Either Sodium-Gated or Calcium-Gated Ion Channels in the Plasma Membrane generate the electrical action potentials in human cells. Pain medicine and herbal remedies reduce the effectiveness of these ion channels to pass the electrical signal, thus reducing the intensity of the pain and other signals to and from your brain. Reducing these signals to very low levels by overdosing on pain medicine can cause death.  Pain Relief using Drugs and ProceduresMany different types of professionals and non-professionals treat pain. Chiropractors, Massage Therapists and Holistic Practitioners use various body manipulations, creams, rubs, heat, vibration, Acupuncture, braces, shoe inserts, magnets, herbal serums and supplements in an attempt to relieve the pain symptoms and possibly the source of the pain. Mainstream medicine uses drugs and procedures in an attempt to accomplish the same results.Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Acetaminophen (NSAIDs), Anti-Depressants, Anti-Convulsants (Anti-seizure) Medications, Muscle Relaxants and Opioids are all examples of drugs that dumb down these natural signals in your body. Of course, these medications have side effects; some of the most common include addiction, developing a tolerance that renders them ineffective, or physical dependence in the form of drug withdrawal.More invasive medical injection procedures include Epidural Steroid Injection, Facet Joint Injection, Lumbar Sympathetic Block, Celiac Plexus Block, Major Joint Injections (Knee, Hip, Shoulder), Occipital Nerve Blocks, Sacroiliac Joint Steroid Injection and Stellate Ganglion Blocks. These involve injecting medication into your body.Even more invasive are the procedures that destroy nerve endings in your body like Radiofrequency Nerve Ablations and Kyphoplasty (Balloon kyphoplasty), Facet Joint Denervation, Discography, Dekompressor Discectomy, Percutaneous Disc Nucleoplasty, Vertebroplasty, Laminectomy, Fusion, Foraminotomy, Osteotomy and Spinal Cord Stimulation.nCap Pain Relief Patch works in harmony with your body, enhancing its natural pain healing mechanisims.

Our patent pending technology:


Tracks your sleeping patterns with sleep lab tested 98% accuracy.

Analyses your body clock using your sleeping patterns.

Personalizes your sleep improvement program to help you resync your body clock.

 
If you don't like mounting things on your wall, we've designed an optional nightstand. To select the nightstand, simply increase the total amount of your pledge by $29 to add the nightstand.Existing Sleep Trackers just track and most light therapy devices just act. When it comes to your health, we don't believe in a 'one-size' fits all concept. Circadia learns and adapts to you, providing you with personalised diagnostics and therapy in one closed feedback loop.   
State-of-the-art sensing technology built into the tracker is able to gather clinical grade sleep data in your bedroom. This data allows the Circadia system to analyze your sleep with unparalleled accuracy and detail, and all this from up to 8-feet away.

The Sleep Tracker monitors your heart rate, breathing rate and body movement with sleep lab-tested 98% accuracy. It then uses this information to predict sleep stages using learning algorithms. 

Circadia gives you push notifications on-the-go helping you resync your body clock to improve your sleep. The system integrates with: 

Fitbit
IFTTT
NEST
Apple HealthKit
Apple HomeKit
MyFitnessPal

 
 In order to enhance your wake up process, the integrated light & audible work together to determine your optimal wake-up time. 1. Light: a built-in dawn simulating wake up light triggers 15-30 minutes before your ideal wake up time to help you wake up naturally.2. Sound: a customizable audible alarm allows you to set your favorite wake-up sounds like that’s your Spotify playlist, soothing tunes like birds chirping, a digital radio station or the classic buzzer.  The Circadia Smart Lamp uses data from your sleep to help you re-sync your body clock throughout the day.  A personalized sleep improvement programme based on light is automatically generated to help you re-adjust your body clock.   Here's how it works:
Morning: up to 45 minutes of exposure in the morning can help you beat your morning grogginess using blue light technology.
Afternoon: for the post-lunch dip just 20 minutes of exposure can help suppress melatonin, the hormone that makes you drowsy.
Evening: just 30 minutes of use pre-bedtime can help you wind down your body and prevent your natural melatonin cycle from being disrupted. 
  Using data from your sleep, Circadia automatically creates a personalised light therapy programme from the second you wake up. With just 20 minutes of exposure after you wake up, it helps you warm up for the day and suppress melatonin, the hormone that makes us drowsy.   The Circadia Smart Lamp is designed to help you boost your performance throughout the day. Dynamic lighting technology allows the Smart Lamp to help you with a shot of ""visual caffeine"" during the day, and powers through the night when you need to burn the midnight oil. Light stimulation can give you this boost without the 6-hour half-life of caffeine which may make you restless at night.  
The Jet Lag mode allows you to adjust your body clock before, during and after your travel. Circadia is pocket-sized, the size of a small Moleskine notebook. It's designed for everyone, those with a 9 to 5 lifestyle or the jet-setters. Adjust your body clock before, during or after your travel   The Circadia Contactless Sleep Tracker and Circadia Smart Therapy Lamp when used together, work day & night to help your sleep, work and live better. Here’s how using both products in tandem helps you.     The Sleep Tracker allows Circadia to detect, down to the exact minute, the exact moment you fall asleep. The Sleep Tracker then sends this information to the Therapy Lamp to automatically generate a wind-down light therapy mode.Using the Smart Lamp for 30 to 90 minutes before you sleep allows you to begin preparing your body for a good night’s rest. Mimicking dusk, it allows you to wind down mentally and promote the release of hormones which induce sleep by preventing your body clock from getting out-of-sync.  The Sleep Tracker works in tandem with the Smart Lamp to wake you up in the right stage of your sleep. For light sleepers, the integrated light and audible alarm features in the sleep tracker will be sufficient to wake you up. For deeper sleepers who take longer to get started in the morning, the Smart Lamp boosts your wake-up process by suppressing hormones that make you feel drowsy and beginning to resync your body with its natural rhythm from the moment you wake up.  By analyzing data from the Sleep Tracker, learning algorithms predict how your sleep quality from the night before, will affect your performance throughout the day. Circadia then uses this information to automatically generate a personalised light therapy programme delivered by the Circadia Lamp known as the Circadia Mode helping you readjust your body clock throughout the day or when you need it the most.  Light is the biggest external factor that controls our body clock. It controls our mood, energy and performance throughout the day by controlling the release of hormones such as melatonin which make us drowsy and cortisol which keeps us alert.Here’s how light controls our body clock:  How light travels through our eyesBy nature, our bodies are programmed to run in sync with natural light of the sun, which changes in wavelength, intensity and patterns throughout the day. However, we live in an era where we spend 90% of our daily lives indoors, under artificial static light which does not mimic the light of the sun. This causes our circadian rhythm to become out-of-sync, leading to problems such as difficulties falling asleep, waking up in morning, and a lack of energy and focus at work. From day one, our approach at Circadia has always been to work with the leading sleep and light scientists from around the world. We’re relying on over 20 years of scientific research to help combat this problem, working with very closely with pioneers in sleep science like Professor Russell Foster.If you are curious to know more about the science and technology behind Circadia, please view our scientific report.University of Oxford, Professor of Circadian Neuroscience, Russell Foster (and Circadia advisor) on the why and how of sleep:  We’re a small design team, dedicated to improving people’s lives by helping them sleep better. The question we constantly ask ourselves is: What would it take to create a complete sleep solution that that not only helps you understand and optimize your sleep but also helps you improve it? For our contactless sleep tracker, we worked very hard to design a product that had several functionality constraints, yet fit into the bedroom.

After working in gyms and studios in Montreal for many years we decided to put our energies towards creating our very own fitness community! Thus, in 2012, Studios Taino was born. We rented studios seasonally and gave classes to corporate clients.
In 2014 we finally opened a beautiful, clean, and new facility of our very own, the first and only Wellness Centre of its kind in Montreal. Here we bring peace and health to people that come with health conditions ranging from physical injury to diabetes, from depression to fibromyalgia. Taino means ""community"" and that is what we are trying to build: a community of healthy and knowledgable people.  We are partnered with many health specialists whose backgrounds include Osteopathy, Reiki, Relflexology, Naturopathy, Yoga, Therapeutic Massage and Pre-natal, who are helping us create this place of healing and health in the community.What We Need & What You GetWe are asking for $15,000 in order to complete the construction of the Yoga Wall. Here's where that money will be going: 

cost of materials (32 foot yoga wall, hooks and straps, belts): $8000-$10k


cost of labour: $4000-$5000


overhead costs: $1000


advertising and grand opening: $500-$1000

The Yoga Wall will be used not only to overcome physical injuries and traumas such as sciatica, degenerative disc disease and arthritis, but also to improve flexibility, joint mobility, blood circulation, and confidence! Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that sometimes the timing isn't right for financial contributions, so there are lots of other ways you can help us out!

<p>Dubai: A Filipino-Indian couple’s happy countdown to the birth of twins has turned into an ordeal.</p>
<p>Dubai-based Andrea Riveria said she was not due until November, but ended up delivering her twin boys Aadi and Arnav on August 2, 10 weeks in advance.</p>
<p>She said the boys needed to be incubated for two months as they were born prematurely at 26 weeks. “But we are in a desperate situation as the mounting hospital bill with each passing day has gone way beyond our reach.”</p>
<p>Andrea said she and her Indian husband Gaurav Rawat were shocked by the unexpected turn of events. Everything was going well until August 1 when she had to be rushed to the private Mediclinic City Hospital after she started bleeding. “I was suffering from acute abdominal pain and my cervix opened by about 4cm. The pain became unbearable by the next morning and I delivered the babies prematurely,” she said.</p>
<p></p>
<div><p></p></div>
<p>She said the babies weighing 820g and 880g were in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) of the private hospital for 10 days at the end of which they ran up a bill of over Dh200,000 ($55,000). “I would not have delivered in the private hospital had it not been an emergency case. Last Sunday, we managed to get an approval from Dubai Hospital for the twins’ transfer but we still need a minimum of Dh400,000 ($110,000) to keep them incubated for eight to 10 weeks as their organs are not fully developed,” she said.</p>
<p>Andrea said: “Aadi and Arnav are our first babies. My husband and I have around Dh100,000 left with us from our combined insurance after the settlement of the hospital bill. But we do not know how we will manage the rest.”</p>
<p>“We desperately need help. Please help us pay our dues and take our boys home,” she said.</p>

<li>Promoting healthy and active lifestyles through adaptive physical activities for people with disabilities.</li>
<li>To involve the community by providing free Para-sport activities to people with disabilities.</li>
<li>Focused on improving the lives of people with disabilities through recreational sports activities.</li>
</ul><h3>VISION</h3><p>To become a platform that breaks barriers for people with disabilities to participate in sports activities, create awareness of adaptive sports, remove stereotypes, and develop resources that encourage adaptive sports for people with disabilities.</p><h3><strong>How It All Started!</strong></h3><p>In 2001, Shelley Gautier was a practicing physiotherapist holding a degree in physical education, when a mountain-bike accident left her with severe head injuries. Shelley spent eight months in rehabilitation and, within a year of the accident, she was back on a bike. By 2007, Shelley was competing in 50 km races and in 2009, Shelley became the first female T-1 rider on the international para-cycling scene. Since then she has dominated her class and won Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) world championships for five consecutive years. Shelley has won eight world titles in para-cycling and competed in the London 2012 Paralympics and the 2016 Paralympics held in Rio de Janeiro where she received a  bronze medal.</p><p>In 2014, she won both the road race and the individual time trial at the Union Cycliste Internationale World Championships in Greenville, South Carolina. This continued to be a tremendous year for Shelley: she was named Ontario Cycling Association Road Female Athlete of the Year; she launched the Shelley Gautier Para-Sport Foundation, to provide encouragement and opportunities for people with disabilities to be participate in sport.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500362307/atjlsk21tptx73mtnnin.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Shelley Gautier Para-Sport Foundation operates by running para-sport programs in existing recreational venues so people with disabilities can be more integrated into their communities. We currently have chapters operating in Hamilton, Niagara Falls, St Catharines, Brantford, Ottawa, Kitchener, and Whitby.</p><h3>What we have accomplished so far.</h3><ul>
<li>We provide Hand Cycles, Tandem Cycles, and Boccia equipment for free use by people with limited mobility and/or vision.</li>
<li>We provide inclusion and participation for people with all forms of disabilities and skills.</li>
<li>We provide both indoor and outdoor programs.</li>
<li>We provide qualified volunteers to help our participants stay safe and have fun while using our equipment.</li>
<li>We encourage recreational therapy so people with disabilities can lead healthy lifestyles and remain active in a non-competitive, recreational sports environment.</li>

Promoting healthy and active lifestyles through adaptive physical activities for people with disabilities.
To involve the community by providing free Para-sport activities to people with disabilities.
Focused on improving the lives of people with disabilities through recreational sports activities.
VISIONTo become a platform that breaks barriers for people with disabilities to participate in sports activities, create awareness of adaptive sports, remove stereotypes, and develop resources that encourage adaptive sports for people with disabilities.How It All Started!In 2001, Shelley Gautier was a practicing physiotherapist holding a degree in physical education, when a mountain-bike accident left her with severe head injuries. Shelley spent eight months in rehabilitation and, within a year of the accident, she was back on a bike. By 2007, Shelley was competing in 50 km races and in 2009, Shelley became the first female T-1 rider on the international para-cycling scene. Since then she has dominated her class and won Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) world championships for five consecutive years. Shelley has won eight world titles in para-cycling and competed in the London 2012 Paralympics and the 2016 Paralympics held in Rio de Janeiro where she received a  bronze medal.In 2014, she won both the road race and the individual time trial at the Union Cycliste Internationale World Championships in Greenville, South Carolina. This continued to be a tremendous year for Shelley: she was named Ontario Cycling Association Road Female Athlete of the Year; she launched the Shelley Gautier Para-Sport Foundation, to provide encouragement and opportunities for people with disabilities to be participate in sport.The Shelley Gautier Para-Sport Foundation operates by running para-sport programs in existing recreational venues so people with disabilities can be more integrated into their communities. We currently have chapters operating in Hamilton, Niagara Falls, St Catharines, Brantford, Ottawa, Kitchener, and Whitby.What we have accomplished so far.
We provide Hand Cycles, Tandem Cycles, and Boccia equipment for free use by people with limited mobility and/or vision.
We provide inclusion and participation for people with all forms of disabilities and skills.
We provide both indoor and outdoor programs.
We provide qualified volunteers to help our participants stay safe and have fun while using our equipment.
We encourage recreational therapy so people with disabilities can lead healthy lifestyles and remain active in a non-competitive, recreational sports environment.
What will my Contributions help accomplish?The SGPSF hopes to increase the number of services it provides to people with disabilities; however, there are financial limitations that currently limit the Foundation’s reach. With your help and contributions, the Foundation will not only be able to maintain the programs and resources it currently has, but also diversify equipment, add new programs, and expand its reach to more cities across Canada.

<h3>Aloha Everyone from the Big Island of Hawaii.</h3>

<h3>Would you like the world's first all-glass, gravity-fed, counter-top, water purifier? </h3>
<p>Would you like filters that last 10 years? </p>
<p>Would you like to remove viruses, pathogens, bacteria, heavy metals, chlorine. fluoride and other contaminants from your drinking water?  </p>
<p>Then I have your answer. </p>
<p>After 5 years of being the Berkey Water Dealer for all of the Hawaiian Islands, I found that many of my customers did not like the metallic taste from the stainless steel Berkeys or the Berkey Light, made out of plastic, as the plastic is known to leach into water - even though they say it is food grade and BPA free. </p>
<p>So I went out and made the best of both worlds, a GLASS version that you can SEE the water level, and know that it is made from the highest quality, clean glass that does not affect the taste of your water. </p>
<p>****** Folks, I have been burned by several Indiegogo campaigns that never shipped out product - that is why I am GUARANTEEING you will receive your product within 2 weeks of your contribution. Yup, its my guarantee. I have these ready to go in a warehouse and each unit is dying for a new home. </p>
<p>This is the most UNIQUE XMAS present, Bday gift, graduation gift, anniversary gift you can give someone. It is the gift of health.  </p>
<p>EVERYONE knows what happened in Flint, MI 5 years ago when the whole town's water supply was contaminated with lead. A few years later it happened in NC. Just a few weeks ago it happened in Newark, NJ. Hundreds of thousands of residents got contaminated water. </p>
<p>If you have not seen the movie Erin Brockovich, staring Julia Roberts, its a must see - another story about the whole town getting cancer from contaminated water.  </p>
<p>Even with some of the cleanest water in the US, with NYC getting its water from the upstate aquifers, if your water goes through 100 year old pipes in your apartment building, it get contaminated.  </p>
<p>No one trusts their tap water anymore, and they have good reason to.   Why not get PEACE OF MIND and purify it yourself in your own home? </p>

<h3>Lets Talk about the filters</h3>
<p>They are the same size and specs as Berkey filters, which are the gold standard in in black carbon gravity filtration elements. They remove viruses, pathogens, bacteria, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride from your drinking water.  </p>

I'm Dr Vern Christenson.</h3><p>The lockdowns under COVID-19 closed down my patients' access to my primary care clinic and my ability to treat them. Going without primary care can be dangerous. It covers 90% of all your encounters with the medical industry. 13 percent of these missed appointments will become expensive acute and chronic care needs if not addressed right away. And the other 87 percent? Well they involve quality of life concerns like pain, mobility, illness, and well . . . just living.

Factory orders currently exceed production 60 to 90 days for some devices and labs (lab manufacturers have almost all refocused on producing COVID-19 tests). We are actively creating multiple distinct sources for kits in different geopolitical environments, with a focus on Taiwan, which is relatively little impacted by COVID-19 and is not in a trade spat with the USA.</p><p><strong>Volume/Pricing Risk</strong></p><p>Several of our devices have seen unprecedented pricing volatility during COVID-19, especially Pulse Oximeters (from $10 to $50) and Forehead or Scanner Thermometers (from $20 to $100). They now appear to have stabilized, so the primary risk is not whether a backer will have paid enough, but rather whether that the backer may have over paid. This potential is antithetical to Remmedy’s purpose and mission and we will do all we can to mitigate it. It is our objective to help people economically with their healthcare. So, our kits are already priced well below market value and the backer should still get an amazing deal.<br/><br/>In the event, however, of a crazy plummet in pricing of key devices (thermometers and oximeters), Remmedy will create a credit on future products (our future digital stethoscope or lab/battery/supply refills, etc).</p><p><strong>Manufacturing Risk</strong></p><p>This is minimal. All factories have been producing these devices and labs for more than a decade. They are well proven in the marketplace and enjoy some volume or scale production advantages. We are also multi-sourcing. Short of some calamitous force majeure, there should be no manufacturing reason the backer does not take timely delivery of quality products.</p><p><strong>FDA Clearance Risk</strong></p><p>All of our devices and labs are FDA cleared (the digital otoscope may be an exception which we are working on). Remmedy will need to work with the FDA on several issues. We do not anticipate any regulatory impediments regarding the devices. The labs may be problematic as even though they are cleared, Class 1 they are intended for laboratory or clinic use only. Remmedy does not advocate consumer use of the labs without clinical supervision via telemedicine. Technicians can confirm labs were prosecuted in a clinically valid way using live or recorded video—thereby extending the lab into the home. This is new territory, but one that is essential to creating greater value, accuracy, and affordability in virtual care and we believe that the clinical supervision standard should exceed some in-clinic procedures using the same exact tests.</p><p>And any case, these are challenging times, and the threat that virtual care may intermittently become your only care warrants exceptional treatment from the FDA. But we are not the FDA. Further, there are other certification bodies around the world that we will want to address with international sales. Until then, the Remmedy Medical Diagnostic Kits do not diagnose or treat or cure any medical condition (these are why we have doctors!), they only provide a means for collecting critical input data for virtual or remote medical professionals to consider.</p><p><strong>Team Risk</strong></p><p>Remmedy has key partners for the management of overseas manufacturing, assembly and shipping. We will develop multiple import management relationships sourcing from multiple end factories to prevent any one source from creating challenges. With unexpectedly large campaign backing, we will explore onshore contract manufacturing in the USA.</p><p>Dr. Christenson offers medical and telemedical expertise in scrutiny of products and their medical viability. See bio above.</p><p>Greg Mockett offers management, contract, legal and business expertise to insure both supply chain and backer relationships are kept well.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Accountability</strong></h3><p>Remmedy will keep all funds not consumed in promotion, transaction, and platform costs related to the execution of the crowdfunding, in escrow. If for any reason, Remmedy will be unable to perform its obligations to deliver kits to backers, the full amount of remaining funds will be returned to our backers.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Refund Policy</strong></h3><p>You are free to cancel your order at any time before it is fulfilled and this can be done via your IndieGoGo backer tools. We will send you an email letting you know when we are about to fulfill your order. This will be your last chance to *cancel* your order and receive a full refund. After this notice, your refund will be limited to product defect issues which will be resolved by your returning the product (or defective parts) to us—on our nickel—and our promptly shipping replacement(s).<br/> </p><h3><strong>Shipping</strong></h3><p>Remmedy is committed to the health of your body and your wallet.</p><p>*All* shipping, therefore, whether domestic (USA) or international, will be charged *after* the campaign. <br/><br/>We have worked very hard to pack a lot of value into the kits for as little cost as possible to our backers. Global ocean or container freight has gone up 25%, but that may reflect $0.25 per kit. Domestic shipping rates, however, have tripled since February due to uncertainty, added safety measures, and probably a little opportunism brought on by Covid-19. We don't know what the shipping rates will be in November 2020 when we plan to ship.<br/><br/>Further, embedding shipping costs into campaign pricing does our backers an additional disservice. First, when free domestic shipping is offered, and full international rates are applied after the campaign for the same perk level, this means international customers are paying for domestic AND international shipping. Second, when shipping is charged within the campaign pricing, several partners take a percentage of the shipping charges (up to 28%*) because their fees are based on gross campaign revenues.</p><p><br/>     For example, if domestic shipping costs are $15.00, we would have to inflate perk pricing by $19.20 to offer free domestic shipping.<br/><br/>By 1) our removing any domestic shipping cost allowance from our perk pricing, and 2) avoiding in-campaign surcharges, we can offer you the lowest shipping cost—after the campaign. We will send you an email *before* fulfilling your order detailing optimized shipping and tax charges particular to your perk delivery. THEN within a 7 days of this notice, you are free to make the decision that the shipping and tax (if relevant) costs are too high or not. Within that notice period you can cancel your order for a complete refund or pay and receive your kit. See Refund Policy.</p><p>For your reference, current domestic and international shipping rates including all duties, GST, VAT and sales taxes to several countries in EU, Asia, Africa, South America, India and Australia shows lowest rates between $20 and $50 with a median of about $28 for a 3 lb package.

And this kit is necessary for us to adapt and change with it. Telemedicine is here to stay""Telemedicine"" or ""virtual care"" is here to stay. It is now a core part of receiving health care for up to 40% of America’s families, depending on where they live. Even deeper adoption is seen in many Asian and European nations. That’s good on one hand: telemedicine is far more convenient, immediate and private. But it lacks critical medical information a doctor can collect in an in-person visit. Telemedicine, as it exists today, is little more than a conversation. And without vitals, labs and examination data, your healthcare provider cannot be as accurate or confident as they would like to be about your care across hundreds of health situations. They are then forced to either over-prescribe medicines you may not need or they must send you to be seen at an Emergency Room or Urgent Care clinic—even when they are pretty sure you are going to waste your money.The Remmedy Medical Diagnostics Kit helps your virtual clinician to be far more accurate and much more certain, saving you thousands of dollars and assuring you uncompromised quality of care.Digital Blood Pressure MonitorThermometerUrinalysisFingertip Pulse OximeterStrep TestDigital OtoscopeWith the kit, you will be able to provide vital health measurements like a heart rate, blood oxygen level, blood pressure, or temperature, and lab test results such as strep or urinalysis, and medical images of inside ears, nose and throat or magnifications of wounds, rashes, bites or stings, bruises, acne, and a lot more. Hi. I'm Dr Vern Christenson.The lockdowns under COVID-19 closed down my patients' access to my primary care clinic and my ability to treat them. Going without primary care can be dangerous. It covers 90% of all your encounters with the medical industry. 13 percent of these missed appointments will become expensive acute and chronic care needs if not addressed right away. And the other 87 percent? Well they involve quality of life concerns like pain, mobility, illness, and well . . . just living. You can’t just skip those!But the lockdowns only highlight an already existing and growing healthcare access problem. If you thought waiting 12 days for an appointment to see a doctor for 7 minutes is bad today, just wait until we feel the full impacts of a 55,000 to 120,000 doctor shortage coming in the next decade as boomer doctors  continue to retire and are not replaced.

Central Clinical Pathology Laboratory and Medical Laboratory Diagnostics
Department within the Molecular Medicine Department at Saint Petersburg Pavlov
State Medical University. Dr. Emmanuel is a medical doctor and professor. He is
also the vice president of the Russian Medical Laboratory Diagnostics
Association; a chief expert in clinical pathology with the Federal Service for
Healthcare Administration for the Northwestern Federal District; and a member
of the Metrological Academy. </p>
<p>Regarding GoBe’s method of automatically
measuring calorie intake*, Dr. Emmanuel concluded:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The concept of the suggested
device is coherent with contemporary ideas about the physiological processes
taking place in the human organism in the course of energy accumulation and
consumption.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The presented description of hardware and software shows that it is the
only system capable of such long-lasting monitoring of glucose concentration in

<a name=""FAQs"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>Healbe FLOW Technology FAQs</p><p><b></b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Q: How was Healbe
FLOW™ Technology developed?</b></p>
<p>A: In 1999, a St. Petersburg-based company called
Algorithm set out to develop a model of how glucose is used within the body,
with the hopes of developing a device that could monitor glucose levels
non-invasively. Algorithm applied the methodology of TRIZ, which is a Theory of
Inventive Problem Solving that brings together multiple disciplines to focus on
a common problem. </p>
<p>The initial working group included an endocrinologist, a physician, a mathematician, and a TRIZ analyst. At later stages of the project,
the team expanded to include clinical diagnosticians, engineers, and
programmers. Development of the basic technology was completed by 2003,
including more than 500 internal tests. </p>
<p>In 2012, Healbe™ acquired Algorithm’s technology and set
out to adapt it to automatically monitor calorie intake and burn. We developed
a stream of mathematical models that allowed us to apply the basic technology
to a range of physiological processes. The final result is Healbe FLOW™
Technology. </p>
<p>Currently, Healbe™ has five separate research groups, each
working on perfecting a specific solution within the overall technology:
Automatic calorie intake and hydration; calorie burn; continuous heart rate
monitoring; sleep; and stress.</p>
<p>Healbe GoBe™ is the first product to leverage FLOW
Technology. </p>
<p><b>Q: How does Healbe
FLOW™ Technology automatically measure calorie intake?</b></p>
<p>A: FLOW Technology uses an algorithm to analyze data from
the Healbe GoBe™ 100% Automatic Body Manager’s three sensors. To calculate
calorie intake, FLOW uses readings from an impedance sensor, taken four times
per minute, to measure the body’s “glucose curve” throughout the day. </p>
<p>After you eat, insulin triggers your cells to absorb
glucose and release water. The Body Manager’s impedance sensor measures these
changes by sending high and low frequency signals through your tissue to
determine the fluid volume of your cells. FLOW uses this information about your
cells’ changing glucose concentrations to calculate calorie intake.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the glucose
curve?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> After you
eat, carbohydrates from your meal are converted into glucose in the blood. Insulin
triggers your cells to absorb glucose, which is used for energy. In the
process, glucose displaces liquids in your cells, and the Body Manager’s
impedance sensor measures these changes in cellular structure by sending high-
and low-frequency signals through your tissue to determine the volume of the
liquids. </p>
<p>FLOW evaluates how quickly glucose is absorbed into your
cells, and how long cellular glucose levels stay elevated, to calculate the
glucose curve. Fat in your meal changes the speed of absorption of glucose, and
hence the shape of the glucose curve. </p>
<p><b>Q: Does Healbe
GoBe™ measure blood glucose levels?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No, GoBe
doesn’t directly measure the amount of glucose
in the blood. It uses an impedance sensor to measure the flow of liquids in and
out of the cells, and uses that data to calculate how glucose is being absorbed
into cells in the body’s tissues.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can a person
with diabetes use GoBe to automatically measure their calorie intake?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> GoBe is not
designed to measure glucose in the treatment of diabetes, and it is not a
substitute for regular glucose monitoring. However, a diabetic who uses insulin
properly to control his or her blood glucose levels would be able to use GoBe
to automatically measure calorie intake.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does FLOW
Technology measure the amount of fats and carbs consumed?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes. FLOW
Technology measures how many fats and carbs you consume, and the Body Manager’s
App provides insights into the macronutrient breakdown of your food. When you
eat, carbohydrates and fats from your meal are converted to energy, using two
separate physiological mechanisms. </p>
<p>The relative proportions of fat and carbohydrates in your
meal effect the shape of the glucose curve. Generally speaking, carbohydrate-heavy
meals cause rapid uptake of glucose by your cells. Meals containing more fat
lead to a slower absorption of glucose. FLOW uses a sophisticated mathematical
model to analyze the dynamics of your glucose curve and determine the percentage
of calories you consume from carbohydrates vs. fats. </p>
<p><b>Q: How accurate is
GoBe’s automatic calorie intake measurement, and how has it been tested? </b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Healbe™ has
conducted multiple tests to determine how accurate GoBe is at measuring calorie
intake. During the tests, subjects wore GoBe while eating precisely measured
meals, and we compared GoBe’s readings with the known calorie content of the
food consumed. Currently, the margin of error for calorie intake measurement is
15-20% compared to calorie counts on food labels. This level of accuracy
compares very favorably to the estimation and guesswork of manual calorie
tracking—and it’s groundbreaking in terms of measuring calorie intake with no
user input.  </p>
<p><b>Q: How accurate is
GoBe’s calorie intake measurement compared to wearable devices and apps that
require users to manually log what they eat and drink?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Trying to
track your calorie intake manually can be very inaccurate for several reasons.
First, there’s user error. Unless you precisely weigh or measure every bite you
eat (including ingredients in prepared meals), you have to rely on estimation.
It’s very difficult to correctly estimate the amount of cheese on a particular
piece of pizza, or the number of chocolate chips in a cookie.</p>
<p>Second, even if you only eat food that comes in a package
that provides a calorie count, the actual calories you end up ingesting will
differ based on how the food is prepared. For example, the calories in a
serving of pasta could vary from 135-320 calories, depending on how well it’s
cooked—so if you’re manually tracking your calories, your accuracy can vary
greatly.</p>
<p>Finally, because of individual differences in metabolism,
two people eating exactly the same type and amount of food might actually
process different amounts of calories from their meals. There’s no way to
account for these differences in metabolism using manual calorie tracking.</p>
<p><b>Q: How will Healbe™
continue to test and improve the accuracy of FLOW Technology’s automatic calorie
intake measurement?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> FLOW
Technology’s automatic calorie intake measurement depends on a sophisticated
model of the glucose curve—that is, how glucose and water are absorbed and
released by your cells in response to calories consumed. Our future efforts
will be aimed at increasing the accuracy of our glucose curve model. We are
also finalizing a more accurate method of estimating the amount of calories
coming from protein in food.</p>
<p>We will continue to conduct internal tests of the product
over the next 2 months for the first version of Healbe GoBe™, with external
testing planned for May-June.</p>
<p><b>Q: How accurate is
GoBe’s measurement of calories burned, and how has it been tested?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> GoBe
measures calories burned during any activity by combining accelerometer data
with continuous heart rate monitoring. We’ve tested the calorie burn
measurement by asking subjects to wear GoBe while performing typical exercises
such as running or walking. We then compare GoBe’s data with standard
calculations based on the subject’s height, weight, and gender—the same type of
calculations a treadmill uses to estimate calories burned during a workout. Currently,
GoBe’s calorie burn measurement is 90-95% accurate, compared to these standard
calculations. We are working on expanding the types of activities GoBe can
accurately measure, and on improving the overall accuracy of FLOW Technology’s
data.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does GoBe
measure blood oxygen levels?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No, GoBe
doesn’t measure the oxygen levels in your blood.</p>
<p><b>Q: How does GoBe track
heart rate? How frequent is the measurement taken?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> GoBe uses a
piezo pressure sensor to measure your heart rate several times in a minute.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does GoBe
measure body temperature?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No, GoBe doesn’t
measure internal body temperature.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Can GoBe measure
calorie intake for someone following a ketogenic or low-carb diet?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes. If
you’re following a ketogenic or low-carb diet, you can use GoBe to
automatically measure your calorie intake by adjusting a setting in the Healbe™
Body Manager app. However; currently, FLOW Technology provides a more accurate
calorie intake measurement for carbohydrates and fats, so if you’re following a
low-carb diet you will see a decrease in accuracy. We are working on improving
FLOW Technology’s ability to measure calorie intake from protein sources.</p><p><b>GoBe Product FAQs</b></p>
<p><b>Q: Is GoBe waterproof?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes.
GoBe is waterproof up to 3 meters. It can be worn in the shower or for a swim.</p>
<p><b>Q: How long does the battery
last?</b></p>
<p>A: The
body manager will operate up to 3 days on a single charge during typical use.
The battery can be fully charged in approximately 1 hour. </p>
<p><b>Q: What color is the band?</b></p>
<p>A: GoBe
is available in black. We anticipate that different colors will be available on
the Healbe™ website starting in July. </p>
<p><b>Q: What physical activities
can GoBe track?</b></p>
<p>A: Healbe
GoBe<sup>TM</sup> combines accelerometer data with continuous heart rate
monitoring to calculate calorie burn and metabolic rate during any activity –
jogging, swimming, cycling, weight training, and more. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: How soon after eating does
GoBe calculate your calorie intake? </b></p>
<p>A: Approximately
15-20 minutes after you eat, glucose concentrations in your blood start to
rise. GoBe detects those changes and uses the information to calculate the
calories you consumed. </p>
<p><b>Q: Can GoBe be used as a
glucose monitor for someone with diabetes?</b></p>
<p>A: GoBe
is not intended to diagnose or treat any medical condition, and it doesn't
replace standard glucose monitoring for diabetics.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does GoBe track blood
pressure?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes.
GoBe uses a piezo pressure sensor to measure pulse wave and blood pressure. </p>
<p><b>Q: What smartphones does the
Body Manager’s app support? </b></p>
<p>A: <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The app is compatible with all phones running a BLE-enabled iOS or Android operating system.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: If my phone’s operating
system doesn’t support the app, will I be able to use all the features with the
website?</b></p>
<p>A: No.
A user must have a compatible phone so information can be delivered to the
website. </p>
<p><b>Q: Can I sync my body
manager’s data with third party apps?</b></p>
<p>A: At
initial launch, GoBe will be compatible only with the body manager app. In the
future, we hope to enable many popular third party apps to analyze GoBe
data. </p><p></p>

History & Technology
Dr. Vladimir
Leonidovich Emmanuel Provides His Expert Opinion on the Technology Behind GoBe
and FLOW. 
Throughout the development of GoBe, Healbe™
consulted closely with Vladimir Leonidovich Emmanuel, M.D., chief of the
Central Clinical Pathology Laboratory and Medical Laboratory Diagnostics
Department within the Molecular Medicine Department at Saint Petersburg Pavlov
State Medical University. Dr. Emmanuel is a medical doctor and professor. He is
also the vice president of the Russian Medical Laboratory Diagnostics
Association; a chief expert in clinical pathology with the Federal Service for
Healthcare Administration for the Northwestern Federal District; and a member
of the Metrological Academy. 
Regarding GoBe’s method of automatically
measuring calorie intake*, Dr. Emmanuel concluded:


The concept of the suggested
device is coherent with contemporary ideas about the physiological processes
taking place in the human organism in the course of energy accumulation and
consumption.

The presented description of hardware and software shows that it is the
only system capable of such long-lasting monitoring of glucose concentration in
blood.
The presented version of the
hardware and software system is coherent with contemporary ideas about
physiological processes taking place in the human organism in the course of
carbohydrate accumulation after a meal.
The accuracy rate of glucose
concentration calculating methods that this hardware and software system’s
computing model is based on (15-20%) are quite enough, in my point of view, for
implementation of a device intended for day-to-day applications.

Frequently Asked QuestionsHealbe FLOW Technology FAQs

Q: How was Healbe
FLOW™ Technology developed?
A: In 1999, a St. Petersburg-based company called
Algorithm set out to develop a model of how glucose is used within the body,
with the hopes of developing a device that could monitor glucose levels
non-invasively. Algorithm applied the methodology of TRIZ, which is a Theory of
Inventive Problem Solving that brings together multiple disciplines to focus on
a common problem. 
The initial working group included an endocrinologist, a physician, a mathematician, and a TRIZ analyst. At later stages of the project,
the team expanded to include clinical diagnosticians, engineers, and
programmers. Development of the basic technology was completed by 2003,
including more than 500 internal tests. 
In 2012, Healbe™ acquired Algorithm’s technology and set
out to adapt it to automatically monitor calorie intake and burn. We developed
a stream of mathematical models that allowed us to apply the basic technology
to a range of physiological processes. The final result is Healbe FLOW™
Technology. 
Currently, Healbe™ has five separate research groups, each
working on perfecting a specific solution within the overall technology:
Automatic calorie intake and hydration; calorie burn; continuous heart rate
monitoring; sleep; and stress.
Healbe GoBe™ is the first product to leverage FLOW
Technology. 
Q: How does Healbe
FLOW™ Technology automatically measure calorie intake?
A: FLOW Technology uses an algorithm to analyze data from
the Healbe GoBe™ 100% Automatic Body Manager’s three sensors. To calculate
calorie intake, FLOW uses readings from an impedance sensor, taken four times
per minute, to measure the body’s “glucose curve” throughout the day. 
After you eat, insulin triggers your cells to absorb
glucose and release water. The Body Manager’s impedance sensor measures these
changes by sending high and low frequency signals through your tissue to
determine the fluid volume of your cells. FLOW uses this information about your
cells’ changing glucose concentrations to calculate calorie intake.
Q: What is the glucose
curve?
A: After you
eat, carbohydrates from your meal are converted into glucose in the blood. Insulin
triggers your cells to absorb glucose, which is used for energy. In the
process, glucose displaces liquids in your cells, and the Body Manager’s
impedance sensor measures these changes in cellular structure by sending high-
and low-frequency signals through your tissue to determine the volume of the
liquids. 
FLOW evaluates how quickly glucose is absorbed into your
cells, and how long cellular glucose levels stay elevated, to calculate the
glucose curve. Fat in your meal changes the speed of absorption of glucose, and
hence the shape of the glucose curve. 
Q: Does Healbe
GoBe™ measure blood glucose levels?
A: No, GoBe
doesn’t directly measure the amount of glucose
in the blood. It uses an impedance sensor to measure the flow of liquids in and
out of the cells, and uses that data to calculate how glucose is being absorbed
into cells in the body’s tissues.
Q: Can a person
with diabetes use GoBe to automatically measure their calorie intake?
A: GoBe is not
designed to measure glucose in the treatment of diabetes, and it is not a
substitute for regular glucose monitoring. However, a diabetic who uses insulin
properly to control his or her blood glucose levels would be able to use GoBe
to automatically measure calorie intake.
Q: Does FLOW
Technology measure the amount of fats and carbs consumed?
A: Yes. FLOW
Technology measures how many fats and carbs you consume, and the Body Manager’s
App provides insights into the macronutrient breakdown of your food. When you
eat, carbohydrates and fats from your meal are converted to energy, using two
separate physiological mechanisms. 
The relative proportions of fat and carbohydrates in your
meal effect the shape of the glucose curve. Generally speaking, carbohydrate-heavy
meals cause rapid uptake of glucose by your cells. Meals containing more fat
lead to a slower absorption of glucose. FLOW uses a sophisticated mathematical
model to analyze the dynamics of your glucose curve and determine the percentage
of calories you consume from carbohydrates vs. fats. 
Q: How accurate is
GoBe’s automatic calorie intake measurement, and how has it been tested? 
A: Healbe™ has
conducted multiple tests to determine how accurate GoBe is at measuring calorie
intake. During the tests, subjects wore GoBe while eating precisely measured
meals, and we compared GoBe’s readings with the known calorie content of the
food consumed. Currently, the margin of error for calorie intake measurement is
15-20% compared to calorie counts on food labels. This level of accuracy
compares very favorably to the estimation and guesswork of manual calorie
tracking—and it’s groundbreaking in terms of measuring calorie intake with no
user input.  
Q: How accurate is
GoBe’s calorie intake measurement compared to wearable devices and apps that
require users to manually log what they eat and drink?
A: Trying to
track your calorie intake manually can be very inaccurate for several reasons.
First, there’s user error. Unless you precisely weigh or measure every bite you
eat (including ingredients in prepared meals), you have to rely on estimation.
It’s very difficult to correctly estimate the amount of cheese on a particular
piece of pizza, or the number of chocolate chips in a cookie.
Second, even if you only eat food that comes in a package
that provides a calorie count, the actual calories you end up ingesting will
differ based on how the food is prepared. For example, the calories in a
serving of pasta could vary from 135-320 calories, depending on how well it’s
cooked—so if you’re manually tracking your calories, your accuracy can vary
greatly.
Finally, because of individual differences in metabolism,
two people eating exactly the same type and amount of food might actually
process different amounts of calories from their meals. There’s no way to
account for these differences in metabolism using manual calorie tracking.
Q: How will Healbe™
continue to test and improve the accuracy of FLOW Technology’s automatic calorie
intake measurement?
A: FLOW
Technology’s automatic calorie intake measurement depends on a sophisticated
model of the glucose curve—that is, how glucose and water are absorbed and
released by your cells in response to calories consumed. Our future efforts
will be aimed at increasing the accuracy of our glucose curve model. We are
also finalizing a more accurate method of estimating the amount of calories
coming from protein in food.
We will continue to conduct internal tests of the product
over the next 2 months for the first version of Healbe GoBe™, with external
testing planned for May-June.
Q: How accurate is
GoBe’s measurement of calories burned, and how has it been tested?
A: GoBe
measures calories burned during any activity by combining accelerometer data
with continuous heart rate monitoring. We’ve tested the calorie burn
measurement by asking subjects to wear GoBe while performing typical exercises
such as running or walking. We then compare GoBe’s data with standard
calculations based on the subject’s height, weight, and gender—the same type of
calculations a treadmill uses to estimate calories burned during a workout. Currently,
GoBe’s calorie burn measurement is 90-95% accurate, compared to these standard
calculations. We are working on expanding the types of activities GoBe can
accurately measure, and on improving the overall accuracy of FLOW Technology’s
data.
Q: Does GoBe
measure blood oxygen levels?
A: No, GoBe
doesn’t measure the oxygen levels in your blood.
Q: How does GoBe track
heart rate? How frequent is the measurement taken?
A: GoBe uses a
piezo pressure sensor to measure your heart rate several times in a minute.
Q: Does GoBe
measure body temperature?
A: No, GoBe doesn’t
measure internal body temperature.

Q: Can GoBe measure
calorie intake for someone following a ketogenic or low-carb diet?
A: Yes. If
you’re following a ketogenic or low-carb diet, you can use GoBe to
automatically measure your calorie intake by adjusting a setting in the Healbe™
Body Manager app. However; currently, FLOW Technology provides a more accurate
calorie intake measurement for carbohydrates and fats, so if you’re following a
low-carb diet you will see a decrease in accuracy. We are working on improving
FLOW Technology’s ability to measure calorie intake from protein sources.GoBe Product FAQs
Q: Is GoBe waterproof?
A: Yes.
GoBe is waterproof up to 3 meters. It can be worn in the shower or for a swim.
Q: How long does the battery
last?
A: The
body manager will operate up to 3 days on a single charge during typical use.
The battery can be fully charged in approximately 1 hour. 
Q: What color is the band?
A: GoBe
is available in black. We anticipate that different colors will be available on
the Healbe™ website starting in July. 
Q: What physical activities
can GoBe track?
A: Healbe
GoBeTM combines accelerometer data with continuous heart rate
monitoring to calculate calorie burn and metabolic rate during any activity –
jogging, swimming, cycling, weight training, and more. 

Q: How soon after eating does
GoBe calculate your calorie intake? 
A: Approximately
15-20 minutes after you eat, glucose concentrations in your blood start to
rise. GoBe detects those changes and uses the information to calculate the
calories you consumed. 
Q: Can GoBe be used as a
glucose monitor for someone with diabetes?
A: GoBe
is not intended to diagnose or treat any medical condition, and it doesn't
replace standard glucose monitoring for diabetics.
Q: Does GoBe track blood
pressure?
A: Yes.
GoBe uses a piezo pressure sensor to measure pulse wave and blood pressure. 
Q: What smartphones does the
Body Manager’s app support? 
A: The app is compatible with all phones running a BLE-enabled iOS or Android operating system.
Q: If my phone’s operating
system doesn’t support the app, will I be able to use all the features with the
website?
A: No.
A user must have a compatible phone so information can be delivered to the
website. 
Q: Can I sync my body
manager’s data with third party apps?
A: At
initial launch, GoBe will be compatible only with the body manager app. In the
future, we hope to enable many popular third party apps to analyze GoBe
data.

The MRI was scheduled for April 2012. The results from the MRI were devastating for us, as the doctors indicated they have found something. The following day we met with the neurosurgeon who to read the MRI images for us, brain tumor on the fourth ventricle he said, the words still echo inside my head, don't remember much more from that day.
After researching for a couple of weeks for the best possibility for him, he was schedule to undergo surgery to remove the tumor. After days of preparations, the day came when we needed to walk the long hallway to the surgery ward, to kiss him and to tell him we will be waiting right there for him.
The surgery was successful but it took a day or two to see him trying to say a word, the long road to recovery was just starting, then the bad news kept coming, after a few days the final results from the histology came, medulloblastoma grade IV WHO.
That was the day we understood for first time our son was starting a long battle against an aggressive type of brain cancer. We were discharged from the hospital after a week and went back after 8 days only to have the stitches removed.
From there on we were again on our own, what to do, who to look for, was most found by internet. We started communication with the kinder clinic of the university hospital in Heidelberg, Germany. In the mean time, Matthew started his physical rehabilitation with a private physiotherapist.
All our efforts pay back when we understood we have date for consultation. The government fund has agreed to pay for his treatment abroad as Bulgaria dont have the tecnology to treat such cancer. We travel on July 8th. to Germany as the appointment was schedule for the 9th.
 
After several days, MRIs, spinal tap and many other tests, we were told about the treatment plan they have made for him, 30 Radiation sessions, 17 to his head and 13 to his spine.
We needed to agree to implant a hickman to receive medication, take blood etc. Radiation finally started on August 2nd. it was hard to see him going half day without food or water as he was put to sleep every day from Monday to Friday in order to receive his daily dose.

<p>Founded in May 2011, Modern Health Fitness (MHF) is a fitness and wellness company that became operational in October 2011. The vision for MHF is to create a alternative healthcare solution that empowers individuals to take control over their health, rather than placing it in the hands of hospitals and insurance agencies. We hold firm on our stance that no reasonable explanation can confirm why the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases is higher each year, when billions of dollars has been poured into research to learn how to treat them. The steady increase in heart disease, diabetes, cancer, hypertension and high cholesterol is unacceptable when medical technology has significantly advanced. <span>In order to attack the root of the problem, attention primarily be directed towards prevention rather than treatment.</span> <span> It is evident that the passive form of prevention (</span><span>having regular check-ups and screenings) </span><span>that has been advocated, is inadequate.</span> MHF wants to help people understand how to prevent chronic disease and live long healthy lifestyles, without the assistance of multiple medications to do so.</p>
<p>The United States’ population is becoming consistently more obese and disease stricken. This is especially true in our inner cities. Most inner cities have significantly more disease and obesity than their suburban counterparts. Many studies have shown that this is due to lack of access to quality food and safe areas to engage in physical activity. We have recognized the impact fitness facilities can have on communities. In flourishing metro Detroit suburbs, where there are adequate fitness facilities and quality food choices available, there is less obesity and disease. Fitness even has its own culture in these areas which adds a social component and encourages more people to be active. This is the impact we strive to have in Detroit.</p>
<p>The model we will introduce in Detroit, MI, one of the most obese and chronic disease stricken cities in the U.S., is a fitness facility with a community health and outreach mission that will change the fitness industry. As it stands, most fitness facilities focus inward on the member experience. Our model not only focuses on member experience, but the overall health of the surrounding community as well. Detroit is currently being revitalized by entrepreneurs and community activists that are facilitating change and trying to reshape the face of this great city back to prosperous times. We will capitalize on the national attention being given to Detroit and empower more people to live healthy lifestyles. Your support you will help us make an impact on the health of many people and spark a change in the philosophy of the fitness industry throughout the country. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are seeking $75,000.00 in funding for community health &amp; fitness programming, relocation expenses, renovation, and equipment for our new location in Detroit, MI. Our renovations will create locker rooms , a multi-purpose group fitness room and a track. </p>
<p>MHF’s perks are sure to get you motivated! They are centered on participating in and promoting the healthy lifestyle movement we seek to erupt.  From memberships and boot camp to paraphernalia and public recognition, there is something for each donor to get excited about.</p>
<p><strong>MHF Starter Gear:</strong> T-Shirt and wristband</p>
<p><strong>Membership:</strong>  A temporary member will get all the advantages of a regular member. Enjoy using the facility at your own accord, in addition to access to all group fitness classes during the time of your perk; including a fitness assessment and nutrition counseling to get you started.</p>
<p><strong>Boot Camp:</strong> You are sure to get a good workout in at our Boot Camp.  Are you limited on time but wanting variety and a place where you can continue to challenge yourself?  Boot Camp will be a great class for you.  Open to men and women at all fitness levels, our high-intensity functional training will teach you movement fundamentals as well as complex exercises that will produce results both inside and outside of the gym!</p>
<p><strong>Group Personal Training:</strong> The perfect option for you and up to three guests to enjoy a personalized workout setting.  Choose from boot camp style training, pilates or dance class.</p>
<p>Our number one concern is covering the cost of renovations so that our new space is operational. Therefore, in the unfortunate event of us not reaching our goal, funds will go toward the completion of renovations and we will acquire additional equipment as we grow.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Detroit is just one urban city amongst many that are deprived the access to fitness facilities that can provide the education, coaching and accountability needed to create a healthy lifestyle. More children and adults are constantly being diagnosed with preventable chronic diseases. Each year there are technological advances being made in the healthcare industry, yet every year there are more people sick than ever. This is because most individuals practice unhealthy habits in regards to nutrition and fitness, on a daily basis. The United States invests billions of dollars every year into preventative healthcare through health screenings, shots, tests, treatment via medicine, etc. However, none of these advances seem address the root cause of disease. Most, if not all people have the onset of chronic disease gradually as they continue to live sedentary lifestyles, maintain unhealthy diets and make other decisions that promote disease. Our mission is to teach and encourage people to live healthy lifestyles; encouraging them that it isn't the chore they initially thought and that it can actually be fun! Our facility will be an environment that adds a modern element to exercising and eating healthy foods. Help us make the impact that is needed in Detroit to start a movement that spreads across the country and to the world. </p>
<p>Our track record with people that come to our small location, tucked in an industrial area of a small city outside Detroit, is great. Our clients are improving every day in their health and fitness. Despite the size of our current stage, we have managed to have a significant impact in many lives. However, we would like to coach and educate many more people than we can host at our current location. Support us with your donation so we can have a larger stage to provide more beneficial programs to the city and help more people change their lives for the better.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>We really appreciate you taking the time to learn more about our business and the change we are creating. Whether you can contribute to our cause or not we encourage you to share our campaign with your friends on social networks and in your personal life. Thanks again for your help!</p>

Our number one concern is covering the cost of renovations so that our new space is operational. Therefore, in the unfortunate event of us not reaching our goal, funds will go toward the completion of renovations and we will acquire additional equipment as we grow.
The Impact
Detroit is just one urban city amongst many that are deprived the access to fitness facilities that can provide the education, coaching and accountability needed to create a healthy lifestyle. More children and adults are constantly being diagnosed with preventable chronic diseases. Each year there are technological advances being made in the healthcare industry, yet every year there are more people sick than ever. This is because most individuals practice unhealthy habits in regards to nutrition and fitness, on a daily basis. The United States invests billions of dollars every year into preventative healthcare through health screenings, shots, tests, treatment via medicine, etc. However, none of these advances seem address the root cause of disease. Most, if not all people have the onset of chronic disease gradually as they continue to live sedentary lifestyles, maintain unhealthy diets and make other decisions that promote disease. Our mission is to teach and encourage people to live healthy lifestyles; encouraging them that it isn't the chore they initially thought and that it can actually be fun! Our facility will be an environment that adds a modern element to exercising and eating healthy foods. Help us make the impact that is needed in Detroit to start a movement that spreads across the country and to the world. 
Our track record with people that come to our small location, tucked in an industrial area of a small city outside Detroit, is great. Our clients are improving every day in their health and fitness. Despite the size of our current stage, we have managed to have a significant impact in many lives. However, we would like to coach and educate many more people than we can host at our current location. Support us with your donation so we can have a larger stage to provide more beneficial programs to the city and help more people change their lives for the better.

<p>In December of 2011, my baby daughter was born (Dana). My life changed forever. I was already in loved with my daughter since the first moment I found out I was going to be a father but when I saw her for the first time, it was amazing. I do not have words to describe this. One of the happiest moments in my life.... My daughter is amazing, so beautiful, smart, she cares for everyone. Is incredible how such a small little person, can do so many good things in your life.<br/><br/>....but then, the problems started.....<br/><br/>Since she was born, my wife and I realized that Dana had a lot of issues to sleep. She was always feeling uncomfortable and crying all the time. We spent many days/nights at the Hospital without been able to figure out what was wrong with her. After visiting many doctors, they were able to determine that Dana suffers from a rare disease that is very similar to something call Celiac Disease (Doctors think this is the evolution of this disease) in which she processes vitamins and proteins the opposite way, causing problems on the way the internal organs work and, because she is so little, the internal organs have not being develop/growing in the way they should. We have already gone thru one surgery 4 months ago where the doctors had to remove part of her intestine due to malfunction (one of the most difficult moments for me and my family).</p>
<h3>Your Help Is needed</h3>
<h3>The Treatment is very expensive (over $100K). We are missing over $20,000!</h3>
<div>
<h2>Why?</h2>
The treatment that can help her with this disease unfortunately the medical insurance does not covers it. Of course, this is money I don´t have. The treatment started last September and ends in March. By then, we need to have the full amount paid or she won´t be able to finish the treatment, which could have a rebound effect on my daughter making things even worse for her.<br/><br/>I´ve been doing everything I can to raise this money... I sold my car, we sold everything in our home that could be sold like furniture, microwave, TVs, etc, currently I have like 4 jobs (work as Program Manager during the day, at night I work at a Contact Center, over the weekends I sell cars at a friend´s local dealer, I also sell Herbalife products and cosmetics). I´ve asked for personal loans, max out credit cards... anything to be able to get to the goal amount but I´m still short. I have had a lot of problems with my wife to the point that we are thinking about getting a divorce. Friends look at me at work and they always make the same comment: ""what´s with the face?"" All I can do is smile and move on, they have no idea how exhausted and stress I feel.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
So please, please please, anything you can do to help.... make donation, tell your friends/co-workers, your community, church - or help with prayers, we will appreciate it forever.<br/><br/>I know that some people dream on seeing their kids graduating from University, becoming Doctors, Lawyers, etc.... all I want is to see my dauther grow.<br/><br/>

On Saturday January 25th, my brother-in-law, Bob Schultz, suffered a serious heart attack. Thankfully, my sister, Christa, and mother were able to perform CPR, saving his life until the paramedics arrived. Bob was taken to hospital and placed into a medically induced coma and onto life support. He remained in that state for nearly two weeks. Meanwhile, complications occurred. He contracted pneumonia, sepsis, c diff, and most tragically, a rare spinal stroke. The stoke has left swelling midway up his spine, preventing him breathing successfully on his own. He is still on life support and in critical care.  The stroke had left him paralyzed, though we don't yet know the full extent. He's currently undergoing a plasma exchange, and we're hopeful that this will help him regain at least some of his mobility. </p><p>This has been an emotional roller coaster for our family, for Christa in particular. She has taken a leave of absence from her job, but the bills are piling up. We need your help. Bob is a good man. He's a strong, proud, gentle, and humble man and his love for my sister has been unmatched. My wish for them is that during Bob's convalescence, they don't have to worry about the impending financial burden.   </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We don't know yet the full extent of Bob's injuries.

<p>Stress may seem like a necessary evil in modern society, but it is a fundamental part of how our bodies function. </p>
<p>When we are threatened, our bodies initiate a stress response, releasing hormones, increasing heart rate, and supplying sugar to our muscles. These changes were the difference between life and death for cavemen. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fast forward to today, our minds have evolved a lot faster than our bodies. Our bodies still respond to things that threaten us, but the ""stressors"" that our minds perceive as threats are often no longer imminent physical threats. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>They are things like bills and deadlines. These aren't threats that you can deal with in the next 30 seconds, let alone the next 30 days. </p>

<p></p>
<p>When our bodies persistently remain stressed, the stress response comes at a cost. Certain body functions like digestion and immune system get put on hold, and it can even cause lapses in memory and judgement.</p>This is why the ability to be aware of your stress response and the skills to manage it are so critical to your quality of life. This is why we're making Olive.

Whether you are managing the expectations of work and life or you are searching for ways to optimize your life, stress can keep us from being our best. 
Olive puts science and technology to work for you.





Olive analyzes your patterns and biological indicators. Olive continuously monitors the complexity of your stress behind the scenes to help you build awareness of your body's stress response. 
Everyone's stress is different. Olive gets to know how stress is triggered for you.



Olive is your personal guide to stress. 
Olive understands your stress over time and provides you with simple solutions that can have a huge impact on the quality of your life. 


Recognizing your stress triggers is the first step in conquering stress. Olive notifies you of increasing stress and helps you conquer it.



Olive discreetly nudges you through gentle taps (haptic feedback) or LED lights on your wrist when it detects elevated stress levels. Olive suggests simple solutions to reverse the negative effects of stress.


If you need help, it's as easy as a swipe to launch an exercise. If you're feeling fine, swipe the other way to ignore it.


Olive works with your smartphone app to cue you through steps of stress management.


Olive preemptively suggests stress management exercises via calming LED indicator lights or gentle, massaging pulses on your wrist to reduce the impact of stress.


Identifying moments when you’re feeling your best and worst are important for taking control of stress. 




Use Olive to capture these moments without having to turn to your phone first because nothing can ruin a wonderful moment like having to fidget with your phone.




Not all of us can walk 10,000 steps a day. Not all of us can sleep 8 hours a day. Not all of us can take 30 minutes to meditate. Olive is here to help.

Our software is designed to understand what your lifestyle patterns look like.
Olive provides little steps to reduce stressors in life, and help you develop the skills to conquer stress when it negatively affects you.
So much information lives on our phones today that can help us create a more complete picture of your lifestyle and what triggers your stress.Olive integrates your calendar, location, and other available data.
This is combined with metrics from Olive to update our guidance algorithms specifically for your needs.
The longer you use Olive, the more it will understand you - what kinds of activities can help you more effectively manage the stress in your life and when these activities should be incorporated into your daily routine.
Huge outcomes can come from small steps. 
We worked with physicians, researchers, and psychologists to come up with short exercises that help you build your ability to handle daily stress effectively.

By having a wide range of practical exercises based on research in fields ranging from fitness to cognitive behavior therapy, Olive not only hones in on the solutions that work better for you, but Olive also helps you build a skillset that can adapt to the various stressors that you will face in life. 


Olive is best used with a smartphone but can be used in standalone mode.
Olive will still detect the physiological signs of stress and help guide you to utilize and control your breath over time. Mindful breathing is a fundamental tool for conquering stress.





Olive is loaded with hardware and extras.




Get an extra strap to change up your Olive style.
In the future, we will be releasing more strap colors so that there will be a color for everyone and for every occasion. 




A charger worthy of your dresser.Olive ships with a standard USB charger, but if you want to charge your Olive with ease and style, upgrade to a Pedestal Charger. 
This premium accessory holds your Olive upright while charging and fits in with your jewelry dresser or your watch stand.








Stress may seem like a necessary evil in modern society, but it is a fundamental part of how our bodies function. 
When we are threatened, our bodies initiate a stress response, releasing hormones, increasing heart rate, and supplying sugar to our muscles. These changes were the difference between life and death for cavemen. 
Fast forward to today, our minds have evolved a lot faster than our bodies. Our bodies still respond to things that threaten us, but the ""stressors"" that our minds perceive as threats are often no longer imminent physical threats. 

They are things like bills and deadlines. These aren't threats that you can deal with in the next 30 seconds, let alone the next 30 days. 


 

When our bodies persistently remain stressed, the stress response comes at a cost. Certain body functions like digestion and immune system get put on hold, and it can even cause lapses in memory and judgement.This is why the ability to be aware of your stress response and the skills to manage it are so critical to your quality of life. This is why we're making Olive. 


From design to prototyping and testing, Olive has come a long way.

We have made multiple iterations of our sensor hardware and are working on:




Merging industrial design and electrical engineering work streams


Developing the user experience for the mobile app


Increasing the sophistication of our machine learning algorithms through more testing and experimentation


Setting up pilot studies for next iteration of Olive prototypes in partnership with major academic medical centers




What is next?




2014: Design for manufacturing


Spring 2015: Design and engineering validation testing


Summer to Fall 2015: Tooling and production


Where do the funds go?




Electrical engineering design for manufacturing ($20K)


Software development ($15K)


Validation testing ($5K)


Tooling ($25K)


Manufacturing ($30K)


Shipping & packaging ($5K)



We are a group of designers, engineers, and strategists with a diverse set of backgrounds who came together to work on Olive because we know loved ones and friends who struggle under the weight of stress.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>May 2011, my husband Qaa'im and I got married the same day we both officially graduated (I had just completed my M.F.A. in sculpture and he finshed his B.F.A. in Graphic Design/Digital Media with a minor in Art History). Off we went with some close family to a near by park and got hitched.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few months later: We get the happy news that we're expecting our first child!! I was working full-time at a hotel for the summer, gearing up for my first semester of teaching at Memphis College of Art. My husband had two different contracts for design projects and life was humming along.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then it all changed...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the beginning of August, I wasn't able to keep any food or fluids down. We figured it was just the genetics I was blessed with and waited eagerly for me to reach the 12 week mark where things had leveled out during my mother's pregnancies. The semester began and I made it into September, puke bags in tow when I went off to teach. 12 weeks came and rather than getting better it got worse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Around the same time my symptoms worsened, my husbands contracts fell through. He wasn't working and I was barely managing it. Three visits to the ER later and I was put on bedrest - where I've been since September 23rd. We've moved from Memphis to live with my parents until the baby is born and we're able to get on our feet again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My husband is still actively seeking work (anything from stocking shelves to coding websites) and we're still waiting on something to come through. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By assisting us with paying for the prenatal care, we'll know that we are able to get the best care for our unborn child. Additionally, what little we are able to make now will be able to go towards food, other medical bills (for myself and thus the baby), and hopefully a trip to see my husband's parents in the near future. (His father is undergoing his last round of chemo therapy soon and we haven't been able to visit them since he was diagnosed with cancer back in May.)</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Though we have plenty of other bills, we are simply asking for assistance with the baby. As our funds are limited, we would love to thank you personally with a video, progress on how the baby is doing, and photos of the little one that you have so graciously helped after they are born. For larger donations ($500+) we'll be willing to create a custom art piece as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't donate, helping us get the word out would be amazing! We are required to pay for the prenatal care by 36 weeks, so the sooner we are able to achieve our goal, the sooner we can make sure the baby's health is completely taken care of!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you in advance to all of those able to help!!!!!</p>

<p>Four years ago, I started teaching cooking, baking, and food preservation classes from my home in Portland, Oregon. <a href=""http://www.lostartskitchen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lost Arts Kitchen</a> got off to a <a href=""http://www.oregonlive.com/living/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/123492933425370.xml&amp;coll=7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">great start</a>. My mission was to empower people who wanted to reclaim the kitchen literacy that enabled our ancestors to thrive without grocery stores, take out, and microwaves. As part of my mission and as a way to give back to my community, I also organized a food buying club for people who live and work in East Portland, connecting farmers and distributors offering high quality meat, produce, milk, eggs, and dry goods with an extended network of friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>But I put my business and my involvement in the buying club on hold for a year while facing two health crises in my family (read <a href=""http://lostartskitchen.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/food-heals/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our story</a> for details). I personally witnessed how dramatically diet can impact well being. When our family came out of crisis mode, I began to think about returning to work. I felt called to help others who need nourishing, home cooked meals but lack the time, energy or resources to prepare it themselves.

<h3>What Can Nourishing Home Cooked Food Do?</h3>
<p> While most of us know that proper diet is one of the foundations of optimal health, in our culture, understanding of the <strong><em>therapeutic role of food in healing</em></strong> is limited. Until I personally witnessed several dietary ""miracle"" cures right in my own circle of friends, I hadn't appreciated the healing powers of foods. In fact, I was (and remain) a skeptic and took some convincing. I know four kids who were formerly diagnosed as autistic and are no longer on the autism spectrum thanks to dietary changes. I know many adults, with a wide variety of health complaints, who only found healing after making dietary changes.</p>
<p>Once I started looking, I saw ""miracles"" happening everywhere. People are reversing conditions like <a href=""http://www.coconutresearchcenter.org/Conquering%20Alzheimers%20with%20Coconut%20Ketones.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href=""http://roosclues.blogspot.com/2012/07/the-view-from-recovery-land.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">autism</a>, <a href=""http://www.drmeschi.com/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cancer</a>, <a href=""http://www.diabetes-warrior.net/about-me-and-diabetes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">diabetes</a>, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/magazine/21Epilepsy-t.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">epilepsy</a>, <a href=""http://myhealingkitchen.com/featured-articles/doctor-cures-her-ms-with-food/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">multiple sclerosis</a>, and <a href=""http://pistachioandthorn.blogspot.com/2012/07/hashimotos-resolved.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thyroid disease</a> with diet. Except, there's nothing really miraculous about the healing powers of real foods. Broths, lactofermented foods like sauerkraut and yogurt, meat and eggs from pastured animals, wild caught fish and seafood, healthy fats, raw foods, and sea vegetables support the body's own healing processes. These foods provide vitamins, minerals, enzymes, proteins, essential fatty acids, and beneficial bacteria and give our interconnected systems what they need to repair and function optimally.</p>
<p>The healing properties of food are lost when it's subjected to conventional farming practices, modern packaging processes like canning and pasteurization, and chemical preservatives. For many, the hardest part of implementing dietary changes for health recovery is finding the time to plan, shop, and prepare these healing foods at home. It can be especially hard to feed yourself well when you don’t feel well or you are caring for someone with special needs. My mission is to provide deeply nourishing food for those who need it most.</p>

My husband was unemployed for a total of 16 months between September 2008 and May 2010.

Four years ago, I started teaching cooking, baking, and food preservation classes from my home in Portland, Oregon. Lost Arts Kitchen got off to a great start. My mission was to empower people who wanted to reclaim the kitchen literacy that enabled our ancestors to thrive without grocery stores, take out, and microwaves. As part of my mission and as a way to give back to my community, I also organized a food buying club for people who live and work in East Portland, connecting farmers and distributors offering high quality meat, produce, milk, eggs, and dry goods with an extended network of friends and neighbors.
But I put my business and my involvement in the buying club on hold for a year while facing two health crises in my family (read our story for details). I personally witnessed how dramatically diet can impact well being. When our family came out of crisis mode, I began to think about returning to work. I felt called to help others who need nourishing, home cooked meals but lack the time, energy or resources to prepare it themselves. I decided to work as a personal chef for individuals and families looking for nourishing meals made to order with high quality ingredients.

<h3 style=""color: #66ccff;"">Scary statistics</h3>
<p>There are more than 1 billion vehicle on roads worldwide. Most of them are driven at night week by week also. There was no solution for any of their drivers to avoid the headlight-blindness effect.</p>
<br/><h3 style=""color: #66ccff;"">620.000 people die every year at night</h3>
<p>1.240.000 people die on roads year by year and half of them at nighttime. This number is extremely high. Nighttime is generally from 8 pm to 6 am. Significant part of drivers go before 12pm and the density of the traffic is much lower than at the daytime. Despite the lower number of vehicles concerned in nighttime traffic, half of the fatalities occured in this period.</p>
<p>Commercial airliner transport had totally 224 fatalities by crashes in 2013.</p>
<br/><h3 style=""color: #ff8800;"">Drivers know, that headlight blindness is a very dangerous part of the nighttime travel as the road in front of the driver is unsighted for seconds.

</div>
<div>
<p>Night Rider is the only real and affordable solution for vision blindness at night due to headlight glare. It consists of two pieces of dark shades, mounted on a light weight frame. The shades are uniquely positioned in front of the eyes so that a slight head tilt deviates the position of eyes onto the shades.<br/></p>
</div>
<br/><div>The opposite side of the road is darkened /only the oncoming, not your lane/, in turn effectively neutralizing the blinding glare of the headlight form the vehicle in front - no matter however bright it is. The special locating of the shades ensure that your vision remains clear and is not impaired in any matter - whatsoever.</div>
<br/><div>
<h3 style=""color: #66ccff;"">Why?<br/>
</h3>
</div>
<div>What gave us the idea to develop the oncoming headlight blocker glasses? Just like everyone else, we were also concerned about the irritating glares from oncoming headlights and the subsequent danger this posed to human lives.</div>
<div>Peter, the inventor of the Night Rider is an everyday driver at night. The contionous glares from the opposite side made him to find a solution. This was the birth of the Night Rider.</div>

<br/><p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""color: #66ccff;"">Difference between the yellow tinted or other driving glasses and the Night Rider</h3>
<p>Yellow tinted glasses are told to increase contrast in nightfall. They cannot do anything against the glaring headlights. Furthermore at night, when there is lack of light, we (and opticians) would not recommend to take on any colored glasses. It is basic physics. All colors filter the light, going through the lense. So that you have less vision coming to your eyes. With the Night Rider you have no lense between your eyes and the road, the lense is positioned to be only between your eyes and the oncoming traffic. It is just the annoying part of your vision.</p>
<p>There are also told to be ""anti-glare"" coated glasses to prevent the eyes from glaring lights but there is the same problem. If the lense is situated in front of all your eyes, it will reflect all the lights. A simple coating cannot choose the light source to filter. What about the Night Rider? It also cannot separate but the lenses are situated to cover only the annoying part of the road and only by your small headtilt indeed.</p>
<br/><br/><h3 style=""color: #ff8800;"">Do you cringe and swear for a solution when a vehicle's headlights blind you? Do you think, night driving is dangerous and you try to avoid it? Than Night Rider is just the product the doctor ordered for you.</h3>

<h3 style=""color: #66ccff;"">How does the Night Rider work?</h3>
<p>NIGHT RIDER is a so simple solution, can be used by anyone. The principle of its operation is that the shaders are situated so close to the eyes, it is enough to tilt your head forward not more than 3-5 degrees and it absolutely darkens the blinding headlights.</p>
<p>We developed the shaders to darken only just as much as it is really needed to not be blinded by the oncoming traffic, but it is still transparent enough to follow their course perfectly. The darkening level is just as much as it is used to be built in to the rearview mirrors in the cars.</p>

<h3 style=""color: #66ccff;"">Where to use?</h3>
<p>Lack of streetlights on country roads and highways make the
eyes get used to the dark. A glaring headlight can blind the drivers' eye the
most at this time. Night Rider is developed to be worn only out of town.
Country roads, highways. Even if it shades out the annoying oncoming traffic
only when you make a small tilt with your head we suggest not to wear in town.</p>

<p>Night Rider is not a gadget, it is a really important

the town it is much darker due to the lack of street lights, the headlights of
an oncoming vehicle can cause blinding for seconds. At 60 m/h your car goes 90
feet/second. Your car takes this distance without your proper visual during this
time. Small distance but can change someone's life forever.</p>

<h2 style=""color: #66ccff;"">F.A.Q.</h2>
<div>
<br/><b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: Is it really working? Such a big problem can be solved so easily?</b>
</div>
<b>A: </b>Yes, of course. It works perfectly. As perfect as simple. You will see.
<div>
<br/><b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: What is the Night Rider for?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>A: </b>Night Rider is an anti headlight-blindness drive glasses. It prevents the oncoming headlight blinding effect and makes the night driving safer.</div>
<br/><b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: How does the Night Rider work?</b>
<div>
<b>A:</b> It has got dark lenses, which are just lets’ say “half-lenses” as they cover only one side of the vision. Its purpose is the darkening effect on oncoming headlights’ beam just as the rearview mirrors in cars. Shaders (lenses) transparent enough not to be disturbing but will prevent from glares.</div>
<br/><b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: Will it fit my head?</b>
<div>
<b>A:</b> It is designed to fit all headsize. Absolutely adjustable and you have to set to your eyes before use indeed. The shaders are able to be set and each Night Rider is shipped with two sized nosepads (for men and women).</div>
<br/><div>
<b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: Does it disturb my vision while wearing?</b>
</div>
<div>
<b>A:</b> After setting up your Night Rider to your head it is out of your field of vision. When a disturbing light comes, you just have to tilt your head forward a little bit (only around 5 degrees) and the shader lenses will darken out only the opposite lane. You are not disturbed anywhere as only the source of the bright light is darkened. Just think it over. If you would not wear the Night Rider, you couldn’t see anything while blinded. Wearing it you will have limited (darken) vision only on the oncoming side but this feature will cause proper visual control on teh whole road.
</div>
<div>
<br/><b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: Do I have to set my Night Rider from time to time to work perfectly?</b>
</div>
<div>
<b>A: </b>Certanly NO. Night Rider glasses have to be set to your eyes only before the first use. The magnetic closure, PU leather coated, handmade hard case, which is shipped to all Night Rider will keep the settings safely until the next use. But if any of the shaders or the nose pad is moved from its position, you will have to reset to your settings of course.</div>
<div><b style=""color: rgb(102, 204, 255); background-color: initial;""><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b style=""color: rgb(102, 204, 255); background-color: initial;"">Q: How can I set it to my eyes? Is it hard to do?</b><br/>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<b>A:</b> Anyone can set a Night Rider by himself easily. It doesn’t take more than 10 seconds and you will never have to do it again. Each Night Rider is shipped with a set-up manual for the proper operation.</div>
<br/><div><b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: What if I cannot set it to my eyes?</b></div>
<div>
<b>A:</b> Each Night Rider is shiped with a setup manual. Wouldn't you be able to do it anyway, our support is here to help you in any questions.</div>
<br/><div><b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: Isn't it uncomfortable?</b></div>
<div>
<div>
<b>A: </b>We developed the Night Rider to be ultra-lightweight. After the first minutes you are getting used to it and will not even notice wearing it. We know, there are many people living their life with long distance trips at nighttime. For them it is very important to have a device like this as comfortable as possible.
</div>
<div>
<br/><b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: Night Rider is a little strange for me. Why does it have so unique outfit from other glasses?</b>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<b>A:</b>Night Rider’s innovation is in the half-sized, only one sided lenses. If you drive a left-wheeled vehicle, the oncoming vehicles are passing you from the left. They will blind you also from the left. So you need the darkening lenses on the left side of your field of vision. Night Rider darkens here only. The traffic in fron of you, in your lane stays uncovered so you will see perfectly. We know, the result of this innovation is a “strange” outfit, but it is only for your safe.
</div>
<div>
<br/><b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: What is the difference between the Night Rider Basic and the Night Rider UP models?</b>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<b>A:</b> The “Basic” is the black version. All colored Night Riders are called “UP” version.</div>
<br/><div>
<b style=""color: #66ccff;"">Q: I would like to order Basic and UP model also in one package. How can I have exclusive pack?</b>
</div>
<div><div>
<b>A: </b>We can deliver you any package mixed. Please conact us for exclusive packages.</div></div>

<h1 style=""color: #66ccff;"">Come with us, it is high time to support a really useful and life-saver innovation...</h1></div>","Oncoming headlight blindness is now a thing of the past...

The oncoming headlight-blindness is annoying, bothering. Not being able to see the road for seconds is very dangerous! Night Rider is the first, really affordable innovation which can prevent any drivers' vision from temporary impairment.

54% OFF the price for the first 100 contributor
Night driving is unpleasant, dangerous and full of distractions. Use Night Rider to make it enjoyable, distraction free and above all - SAFE!

Our solution is:











There are more than 1 Billion cars worldwide without efficient equipment against the headlight-blindness effect for the drivers. This everyday-danger causes fatal accidents day by day.

Scary statistics
There are more than 1 billion vehicle on roads worldwide. Most of them are driven at night week by week also. There was no solution for any of their drivers to avoid the headlight-blindness effect.
620.000 people die every year at night
1.240.000 people die on roads year by year and half of them at nighttime. This number is extremely high. Nighttime is generally from 8 pm to 6 am. Significant part of drivers go before 12pm and the density of the traffic is much lower than at the daytime. Despite the lower number of vehicles concerned in nighttime traffic, half of the fatalities occured in this period.
Commercial airliner transport had totally 224 fatalities by crashes in 2013.
Drivers know, that headlight blindness is a very dangerous part of the nighttime travel as the road in front of the driver is unsighted for seconds. Warning signs of an approaching danger remain undetectable during this time and unfortunately this causes fatal accidents lots of time.

WHO (World Health Organisation) reports that on-road fatalities will reach the 1.9 Million per year by the year 2020! It is 53% more than in the year 2012.

Real & Affordable


Night Rider is the only real and affordable solution for vision blindness at night due to headlight glare. It consists of two pieces of dark shades, mounted on a light weight frame. The shades are uniquely positioned in front of the eyes so that a slight head tilt deviates the position of eyes onto the shades.

The opposite side of the road is darkened /only the oncoming, not your lane/, in turn effectively neutralizing the blinding glare of the headlight form the vehicle in front - no matter however bright it is. The special locating of the shades ensure that your vision remains clear and is not impaired in any matter - whatsoever.

Why?


What gave us the idea to develop the oncoming headlight blocker glasses? Just like everyone else, we were also concerned about the irritating glares from oncoming headlights and the subsequent danger this posed to human lives.
Peter, the inventor of the Night Rider is an everyday driver at night. The contionous glares from the opposite side made him to find a solution. This was the birth of the Night Rider.
More than 620.000 people die every year in nighttime accidents on roads globally. Now you can help a life-saver innovation to be available for everyone.

Who for?

Everyday drivers       The more miles you drive the
bigger risk you take. Night Rider                                         should be in your car daily.
Sunday drivers          Substitute the everyday driving
routine with a better vision at                                           night.
Elders                          Sensitivity for oncoming bright light
increases with age. Night                                           Rider rejuvenates your vision at night.
Young drivers             New on roads? Night Rider gives you
additional assistance for                                         night trips.
Nyctalopia                  Suffering from night blindness? Night Rider gives you a helping                                       hand to filter the bright headlights at night.
Truck drivers              We don’t have to convince you, do we?




Difference between the yellow tinted or other driving glasses and the Night Rider
Yellow tinted glasses are told to increase contrast in nightfall. They cannot do anything against the glaring headlights. Furthermore at night, when there is lack of light, we (and opticians) would not recommend to take on any colored glasses. It is basic physics. All colors filter the light, going through the lense. So that you have less vision coming to your eyes. With the Night Rider you have no lense between your eyes and the road, the lense is positioned to be only between your eyes and the oncoming traffic. It is just the annoying part of your vision.
There are also told to be ""anti-glare"" coated glasses to prevent the eyes from glaring lights but there is the same problem. If the lense is situated in front of all your eyes, it will reflect all the lights. A simple coating cannot choose the light source to filter. What about the Night Rider? It also cannot separate but the lenses are situated to cover only the annoying part of the road and only by your small headtilt indeed.
Do you cringe and swear for a solution when a vehicle's headlights blind you? Do you think, night driving is dangerous and you try to avoid it? Than Night Rider is just the product the doctor ordered for you.

Night Rider is a fully developed and tested product.

Night Rider Basic (black)



Night Rider UP (many colors, see our gallery)







Night Rider Up also has black shades. For the perfect darkening effect the shades are to be transparent black. We have provided multiple color choice in the frames.

How does the Night Rider work?
NIGHT RIDER is a so simple solution, can be used by anyone. The principle of its operation is that the shaders are situated so close to the eyes, it is enough to tilt your head forward not more than 3-5 degrees and it absolutely darkens the blinding headlights.
We developed the shaders to darken only just as much as it is really needed to not be blinded by the oncoming traffic, but it is still transparent enough to follow their course perfectly. The darkening level is just as much as it is used to be built in to the rearview mirrors in the cars.





Principle of work

Night Rider consists of two pieces of dark shades on a frame, uniquely positioned in front of the eyes so that a slight head tilt deviates the eyes’ positions on the pieces of shades. The opposite side of the road is darkened, in turn effectively neutralizing the blinding headlight glare of the vehicle in front – no matter however bright. The special property of the shades ensure that your vision remains clear and is not impaired in any manner
By our Indiegogo campaign you can avoid a not yet occured accident and help us to get the Night Rider to everyone also.
You don't want to contribute but like our efforts? You can also help reaching it by sharing our campaign. Our referral fans can get some interestnig reward. Learn more about our referral program here.


Where to use?
Lack of streetlights on country roads and highways make the
eyes get used to the dark. A glaring headlight can blind the drivers' eye the
most at this time. Night Rider is developed to be worn only out of town.
Country roads, highways. Even if it shades out the annoying oncoming traffic
only when you make a small tilt with your head we suggest not to wear in town.

Night Rider is not a gadget, it is a really important
accessory of nighttime drivers.

Night Rider protects the driver's peripheral vision from the impairment due to oncoming headlight glares but keeps it clear in the front.
Every driver has experiences about blinding beams. Out of
the town it is much darker due to the lack of street lights, the headlights of
an oncoming vehicle can cause blinding for seconds. At 60 m/h your car goes 90
feet/second. Your car takes this distance without your proper visual during this
time. Small distance but can change someone's life forever.




Shipping


We ship worldwide. all our perks include the shipping price.
You will get your Night Rider all around the world. Would we have problem
sending you your wished product, we will get in touch with you immediately.

When do we ship?
Night Rider is in front of the mass production. As soon as
the molds are ready for the mass production, we are starting it. It is to be in
the late Q3 2014. Closing our Indiegogo campaign we will organise the pieces of
the Night Riders per colors and make the mass production by that to deliver the
ready products to our contributors first. This method is also the same with the
cases. Seeing the needed quantity and colors we will make the mass production
and deliver all Night Rider in wished color with the ordered case.

Where do we ship?
Shortly, everywhere. One of our main goal is to make the Night Rider available for everyone globally. Until you are not on Mars, we will send out your Night Rider.


""Join us, make the night driving safer together""



Hard Case
Each Night Rider is shipped with a PU leather case. They are all handmade and have a silky touch with a ""Joyful to touch"" feeling. Magnetic closure helps you to get your Night Rider in & out of the case with ease. We ship our product in white or black hard case, up to your choose. Colorful cases will be available when our campaign reaches a given Target Level.


What do we collect for?


We are in the early stages of the mass production. Your contribution will help the mass production to be started (including the cases) but our campaign is not only for that. We would like to build up our distributor channel to let everyone have their Night Rider.



Why do we think you are interested in this campaign?
Honestly, you will be a Night Rider owner and you can drive much safer at night. With it you will also notice others' mistakes as you are not blinded. But also helpin us to build our worldwide distribution for a safer night drive with your contribution you will also take apart in your own safety by helping us to make it available to everyone. Why? 

Because there is only one safer nighttime situation  than wearing a Night Rider. If the oncoming driver also has one.






Where are we now?







Prototypes

We have got prototypes ready. They are 3D printed versions,
but fully functionable (only the shaders tranparency is not available in 3D
printing). Tests were made with these 3D models and even they are not exactly
the same as quality is not available in 3D printing, all our testers were
satisfied with the efforts and looking forward to get their Night Riders for
their assistance in the development. 



This is our 2nd wave prototype. Until our molding moulds are ready, we can have just 3D printed version, which is absolutely different quality of course.



Contributing the Night Rider you vote for safer roads and participate in our project for a quiter world.

Mass Production
We are almost ready for mass production. Our molding mould is under preparation. It was designed by the newest technologies to make the Night Rider a perfectly developed product. This will make us able to make as many product, as we can sell. Our first mass production is going to be ready in Q4 2014. Our Indiegogo orders will be delivered at that time also.





Night Rider is made of molded plastic. Our mould is under contruction now.

F.A.Q.

Q: Is it really working? Such a big problem can be solved so easily?

A: Yes, of course. It works perfectly. As perfect as simple. You will see.

Q: What is the Night Rider for?


A: Night Rider is an anti headlight-blindness drive glasses. It prevents the oncoming headlight blinding effect and makes the night driving safer.
Q: How does the Night Rider work?

A: It has got dark lenses, which are just lets’ say “half-lenses” as they cover only one side of the vision. Its purpose is the darkening effect on oncoming headlights’ beam just as the rearview mirrors in cars. Shaders (lenses) transparent enough not to be disturbing but will prevent from glares.
Q: Will it fit my head?

A: It is designed to fit all headsize. Absolutely adjustable and you have to set to your eyes before use indeed. The shaders are able to be set and each Night Rider is shipped with two sized nosepads (for men and women).

Q: Does it disturb my vision while wearing?


A: After setting up your Night Rider to your head it is out of your field of vision. When a disturbing light comes, you just have to tilt your head forward a little bit (only around 5 degrees) and the shader lenses will darken out only the opposite lane. You are not disturbed anywhere as only the source of the bright light is darkened. Just think it over. If you would not wear the Night Rider, you couldn’t see anything while blinded. Wearing it you will have limited (darken) vision only on the oncoming side but this feature will cause proper visual control on teh whole road.


Q: Do I have to set my Night Rider from time to time to work perfectly?


A: Certanly NO. Night Rider glasses have to be set to your eyes only before the first use. The magnetic closure, PU leather coated, handmade hard case, which is shipped to all Night Rider will keep the settings safely until the next use. But if any of the shaders or the nose pad is moved from its position, you will have to reset to your settings of course.


Q: How can I set it to my eyes? Is it hard to do?



A: Anyone can set a Night Rider by himself easily. It doesn’t take more than 10 seconds and you will never have to do it again. Each Night Rider is shipped with a set-up manual for the proper operation.
Q: What if I cannot set it to my eyes?

A: Each Night Rider is shiped with a setup manual. Wouldn't you be able to do it anyway, our support is here to help you in any questions.
Q: Isn't it uncomfortable?


A: We developed the Night Rider to be ultra-lightweight. After the first minutes you are getting used to it and will not even notice wearing it. We know, there are many people living their life with long distance trips at nighttime. For them it is very important to have a device like this as comfortable as possible.


Q: Night Rider is a little strange for me. Why does it have so unique outfit from other glasses?



A:Night Rider’s innovation is in the half-sized, only one sided lenses. If you drive a left-wheeled vehicle, the oncoming vehicles are passing you from the left. They will blind you also from the left. So you need the darkening lenses on the left side of your field of vision. Night Rider darkens here only. The traffic in fron of you, in your lane stays uncovered so you will see perfectly. We know, the result of this innovation is a “strange” outfit, but it is only for your safe.


Q: What is the difference between the Night Rider Basic and the Night Rider UP models?



A: The “Basic” is the black version. All colored Night Riders are called “UP” version.

Q: I would like to order Basic and UP model also in one package. How can I have exclusive pack?


A: We can deliver you any package mixed. Please conact us for exclusive packages.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>I have identified a potential treatment; rather I have an idea for a treatment, for vulvadynia, specifically vulvar/vestibular inflammation, which is a condition that affects millions of women. It is a debilitating and chronic pain condition that women suffer with, often in silence, and it often goes misdiagnosed and is frequently untreated. Vulvodynia occurs as a result of problems with the small nerve fibers in that area, and it does not manifest itself visually. It is characterized by the nerve endings in those areas being super-sensitive and painful to the touch. The pain may be constant or come and go in cycles. <br/><br/> Sexual intercourse, walking, sitting or exercising can make the pain worse. Treatments for this condition are limited, experimental, and mostly geared towards minimizing or masking symptoms rather than treatment of the cause. I identified the cannonball jellyfish as a potential treatment.   There is a special type of collagen and glycose amino glycan (a specific protein) from the cannonball jellyfish that is indigenous to the coast of Georgia, where my family has a home. I came upon this idea by chance when I was vacationing there two summers ago and went out shrimping on a shrimp boat. When we returned to the docks there were several Japanese men waiting to purchase the jellyfish that had been randomly brought up in the nets (there were hundreds if not thousands of them). I came to find out that the jellyfish contain a collagen type II (similar to chicken and bovine) that they are using for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as well as osteoarthritis. Apparently it has decreased incidence of tolerance and lower allergic reaction than the traditional collagen therapies currently being used to treat this condition. There is a body of evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory benefits of this jellyfish collagen taken orally as well as delivered into the joint directly. Someone out of Auburn University has already patented the methodology for the extraction of the collagen as well as the oral use of it for rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p> In addition to the collagen extracted from whole jellyfish, the actual jelly is rich in glycose amino glycans which I thought may be beneficial either orally or delivered intravesically in patients with interstitial cystitis, but that will be my NEXT project. I also believe that the jellyfish/jelly may be an ideal vaginal lubricant moiety for women who are allergic or sensitive to traditional over the counter lubricants. My idea is to extract the collagen and apply it vaginally/transmucosally as well as orally for relief/treatment of pain/inflammation related to vulvadynia and IC. It may even promote/enhance vaginal integrity/health as well as wound healing.</p>
<p> While I have had access to these jellyfish, I do not have the resources to fund the chemistry lab to do the full and complete extraction in bulk. It is a tedious process. The purpose of this proposal is to raise funds to do a formal placebo controlled pilot study in women with this condition. I would absolutely love your involvement in this project. I have tested the product in approximately 20 of my patients with great success but have NOT yet done a formal study. As such, it is only anecdotal evidence and an remains an idea.  That said a natural (from the Sea!), well tolerated anti-inflammatory product for treatment of this chronic condition in women, which is a difficult to manage, could really be meaningful to women as well as the medical comunity. The next step which needs to happen simultaneously with the extraction of the collagen and pilot safety study is to begin the patent process. I have a lot of data about the safety and use of this type of jellyfish. They do not sting by the way!!</p>
<p>Your funds will be used to fund the pilot study, extraction of collagen from the jellyfish (approximately 100 will be needed) and compounding and formulation of the topical cream that will be used in the study—and for those of you that contribute to the study we will be making extra!!. We aim to study at least 20 women. Here is the beginning of the abstract I would like to present at next year's International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health:</p>
<p><strong>Objectives: To determine if Cannonball jellyfish Type II collagen delivered topically alleviates vulvar/vestibular pain in patients with vulvadynia. Prior studies have shown that oral administration of low doses of jellyfish delays the onset and suppresses inflammation and arthritis in animal and human models. Type II collagen from jellyfish has a suppressing effect on the inflammatory cascade of rheumatoid arthritis. </strong></p>
<p>Materials and Methods: A visual analogue Pain Scale and Distress Scale will be filled out by 20 women with focal vulvodynia during 3 consecutive visits. Focal vulvar pain will be assessed with a score from 1 to 10 on 7 areas of the vestibule. Patients will apply 1 gram of treatment of water and oil based vaginal cream with 6 Cannonball jellyfish per 30 grams. Fresh Cannonball jellyfish will be obtained from the coastal waters of Sea Island, GA. </p>
<p>My hypothesis is that daily application of a topical cream with jellyfish will decrease symptoms of vulvar vestibular pain in women with vulvadynia. Jellyfish can provide a cost effective safe protein that will likely have a suppressing effect on the inflammation and pain associated with vulvadynia. This modality appears to be effective and merits further study.</p>
<p> </p></div>","I have identified a potential treatment; rather I have an idea for a treatment, for vulvadynia, specifically vulvar/vestibular inflammation, which is a condition that affects millions of women. It is a debilitating and chronic pain condition that women suffer with, often in silence, and it often goes misdiagnosed and is frequently untreated. Vulvodynia occurs as a result of problems with the small nerve fibers in that area, and it does not manifest itself visually. It is characterized by the nerve endings in those areas being super-sensitive and painful to the touch. The pain may be constant or come and go in cycles.  Sexual intercourse, walking, sitting or exercising can make the pain worse. Treatments for this condition are limited, experimental, and mostly geared towards minimizing or masking symptoms rather than treatment of the cause. I identified the cannonball jellyfish as a potential treatment.   There is a special type of collagen and glycose amino glycan (a specific protein) from the cannonball jellyfish that is indigenous to the coast of Georgia, where my family has a home. I came upon this idea by chance when I was vacationing there two summers ago and went out shrimping on a shrimp boat. When we returned to the docks there were several Japanese men waiting to purchase the jellyfish that had been randomly brought up in the nets (there were hundreds if not thousands of them). I came to find out that the jellyfish contain a collagen type II (similar to chicken and bovine) that they are using for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as well as osteoarthritis. Apparently it has decreased incidence of tolerance and lower allergic reaction than the traditional collagen therapies currently being used to treat this condition. There is a body of evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory benefits of this jellyfish collagen taken orally as well as delivered into the joint directly. Someone out of Auburn University has already patented the methodology for the extraction of the collagen as well as the oral use of it for rheumatoid arthritis.
 In addition to the collagen extracted from whole jellyfish, the actual jelly is rich in glycose amino glycans which I thought may be beneficial either orally or delivered intravesically in patients with interstitial cystitis, but that will be my NEXT project. I also believe that the jellyfish/jelly may be an ideal vaginal lubricant moiety for women who are allergic or sensitive to traditional over the counter lubricants. My idea is to extract the collagen and apply it vaginally/transmucosally as well as orally for relief/treatment of pain/inflammation related to vulvadynia and IC. It may even promote/enhance vaginal integrity/health as well as wound healing.
 While I have had access to these jellyfish, I do not have the resources to fund the chemistry lab to do the full and complete extraction in bulk. It is a tedious process. The purpose of this proposal is to raise funds to do a formal placebo controlled pilot study in women with this condition. I would absolutely love your involvement in this project. I have tested the product in approximately 20 of my patients with great success but have NOT yet done a formal study. As such, it is only anecdotal evidence and an remains an idea.  That said a natural (from the Sea!), well tolerated anti-inflammatory product for treatment of this chronic condition in women, which is a difficult to manage, could really be meaningful to women as well as the medical comunity. The next step which needs to happen simultaneously with the extraction of the collagen and pilot safety study is to begin the patent process. I have a lot of data about the safety and use of this type of jellyfish. They do not sting by the way!!
Your funds will be used to fund the pilot study, extraction of collagen from the jellyfish (approximately 100 will be needed) and compounding and formulation of the topical cream that will be used in the study—and for those of you that contribute to the study we will be making extra!!. We aim to study at least 20 women. Here is the beginning of the abstract I would like to present at next year's International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health:
Objectives: To determine if Cannonball jellyfish Type II collagen delivered topically alleviates vulvar/vestibular pain in patients with vulvadynia. Prior studies have shown that oral administration of low doses of jellyfish delays the onset and suppresses inflammation and arthritis in animal and human models. Type II collagen from jellyfish has a suppressing effect on the inflammatory cascade of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Materials and Methods: A visual analogue Pain Scale and Distress Scale will be filled out by 20 women with focal vulvodynia during 3 consecutive visits. Focal vulvar pain will be assessed with a score from 1 to 10 on 7 areas of the vestibule. Patients will apply 1 gram of treatment of water and oil based vaginal cream with 6 Cannonball jellyfish per 30 grams. Fresh Cannonball jellyfish will be obtained from the coastal waters of Sea Island, GA. 
My hypothesis is that daily application of a topical cream with jellyfish will decrease symptoms of vulvar vestibular pain in women with vulvadynia. Jellyfish can provide a cost effective safe protein that will likely have a suppressing effect on the inflammation and pain associated with vulvadynia. This modality appears to be effective and merits further study.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi! Danielle here. I’m lucky to call myself Brenden’s partner and best friend. I’m typing because Brenden is too stubborn to ask, but he really could use your help right now.</p>
<p>Whether it’s positive thoughts, prayers, a donation - big or small, a thoughtful note, or love... please consider sending a helpful contribution to support my lovely partner and small Michigan business owner, Brenden and Whispering Pines Tea Company (WPTC). Unfortunately, a considerable portion of Brenden’s tea was lost due to a flood last weekend. In this time, WPTC could use extra support to bounce back into action. Brenden is the most loving person I’ve ever met, and is certainly deserving of help. He puts love into EVERYTHING he does whether it’s cooking, slacklining, handstanding, random projects, and of course, his tea. I see the “behind the scenes” of WPTC, and each day I am inspired by the continuous pure love Brenden puts into this company. He works so hard, doing everything by himself - the website, photography, order fulfillment, blending, brainstorming, and everything else it takes to run a small business. For him, WPTC truly is more than just a job, it’s his passion, his love, his life. We’re overflowing with gratitude for all the love and support. </p>
<p>I’d like to give a special thanks to all Brenden’s customers who allow him to do what he loves every day - share tea. I’m hopeful that Brenden will continue to be able to share his tea with you all very soon. Make today magical. :-)</p>

Let’s face it, we’ve all had one or the other cut and struggled getting our BUSH in order. However, this will be a thing of the past with our BUSH™Trimmer.</p>
<p><br/>We are proud to present you with the BUSH™Trimmer. This is the result of hours of trial shaves, where we put our balls on the line for you!

</div></div>","Our Story and Impact
Some people think that gifts have to cost loads of money or be extremely extravagant or expensive to mean something.  Others who don’t have family or friends in their lives may feel differently and alone, where a simple hello or hug can mean the world to them or make them feel special.  I wanted to give back to the community and the elderly in nursing homes that may not have family or friends around the Holidays.  I don’t have a lot of money myself to buy each and everyone a gift, I thought about my special talents within myself that I could use to help them, and the first thing that came to mind was my ability to crochet.
My name is Lisa and I am 36 years old.  When I was 12 years old my loving grandmother, Bessie taught me how to crochet for the first time.  I have been crocheting now for 24 years and I love it.  I decided that because I loved to crochet, I would start making blankets for the elderly in a nursing home for Christmas.  On December 22, 2010 I delivered 43 blankets, 50 figurines and 50 Christmas Cards to a nursing home within my area.  
 I would like to donate to Nursing Homes this year and for many years to come.  I am asking for donations of yarn to help so that I will be able to make more blankets.  My goal for this year is around 100 blankets and 100 ceremic figurines.  I feel the best part of this project is going to be giving to the elderly in the community.  It will be a wonderful experience and teach me that love and kindness comes within and doesn’t have to cost a fortune or come in a fancy package.  Just to see the joy on their faces will mean a lot to me!

<p><span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><b>When in full health, our mouth and throat are continuously moistened by salivary gland secretions.</b></span> Along with keeping our mouth hydrated and feeling comfortable, saliva is vital for maintaining oral health: it's essential for the prevention of bacterial overgrowth that can lead to plaque formation and dental caries; it provides lubrication of the mouth and throat to aid in swallowing; and it helps maintain mineralization of the teeth. Saliva also contains enzymes which initiate the digestion of food, and antibodies that help keep our immune system strong.</p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>We exhaustively studied the marketplace and scrutinized every product out there, taking particular care to discern the most important qualities of each: their effectiveness; their ingredients; how they tasted; and the quality of their mouthfeel. We also considered whether the company behind each product took a conventional or integrative, whole-world approach to health and well-being, including their position, or lack thereof, on sustainability.</p></span>
<span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><p><strong>We discovered that an authentically holistic dry mouth solution was woefully absent.</strong><br/></p></span>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>The current market-dominant dry mouth product line is made by one of the world's largest pharmaceutical corporations, and, in line with a behemoth pharmaceutical's bottomline philosophy, a herbal solution is far from its primary focus. Furthermore, not one of the products we looked at offered a genuinely mouthwatering (saliva-inducing) experience. Considering that dry mouth is often a daily issue for many, we were inspired to create an authentic—and decidedly effective—herbal solution for dry mouth.</p></span>

<div>
<div>
<span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><p><strong>We examined the problem systematically.</strong><br/></p></span>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We brainstormed with our network of colleagues and herbalists and mentors; we consulted with ethnobotanists; we tracked down obscure scientific papers; we learned from food flavor gurus; we made teas and tinctures and chewed the raw herbs; we tested and retested numerous herbal combinations and formulated and reformulated prototypes.

complex and multidimensional.  Each herb features a diverse array of compounds that affect the body simultaneously, providing multiple benefits. </span></p>For example, though our primary herb spilanthes is principally used for its oral health benefits, it is also a superbly effective antimicrobial.<p></p>When herbs are combined with one another, the element of herbal synergy also comes into play. Interactions amongst each plants' multiple components occurs, potentiating the effect of the whole.<p></p>
<p>Z!!NGLES' synergistic formulation provides benefits beyond dry mouth relief:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li style=""text-align: left;"">Exposure to airborne viruses is inevitable, especially in crowded places such as airplanes and public transportation. <span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><b>Keep a bottle of Z!!NGLES handy when you're flying or traveling</b> to maintain healthy mouth and throat hydration, which helps protect from colds and flu.</span> You can also use Z!!NGLES anytime you feel a sore throat coming on. </li></ul>
<ul><li style=""text-align: left;"">Singers and public speakers, take note! Z!!NGLES is the ideal solution for the rigors of every professional singer, public speaker, teacher or voice-over artist. <span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><b>If your career demands you use your voice constantly</b>, there's no better way to protect it</span> than with Z!!NGLES. Z!!NGLES immediately and reliably encourages saliva flow to maintain mouth hydration, ease dry throat discomfort, and eliminate raspy hoarseness. Speak or sing with the secure certainty of feeling and sounding your most confident best.</li></ul>
<ul><li style=""text-align: left;"">Saliva is vitally important for digestion, and Z!!NGLES helps to get yours flowing! Saliva provides lubrication for swallowing, contains enzymes that initiate the digestive process, and protects vitamin B12 from stomach acid. <span style=""color: #4c4c4c;"">Use Z!!NGLES before or after a meal to help <b>support healthy digestion.</b></span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li style=""text-align: left;"">Bad breath? <span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><b>Freshen your breath throughout the day</b></span>—a quick spray or two before a meeting or a date, or during a workout, will enliven your mouth and refresh your breath. [Note: Bad breath (halitosis) is something that we all experience from time-to-time; however, chronic halitosis can be an indicator of other underlying health issues—a visit to your doctor to find out the cause is recommended.] </li></ul>
<ul><li style=""text-align: left;"">The importance of oral health extends beyond the mouth. An interesting recent study suggests an <b>association between oral health and Alzheimer disease</b>: of those individuals with Alzheimer who also had gum disease, there was a six-fold increase in the rate of cognitive decline over a six-month period.<a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151081"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;""><sup>7</sup></a><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span> </li></ul><p></p>

<p>Spilanthes itself has a light citrus and herbal-green, sparkling clean taste along with a notable tingling 'buzzing' sensation—followed quickly by a reliable flow of saliva. This sensation is normal (and a sign that the herbs in Z!!NGLES are working!) and will subside after a few minutes. Feel into the unique sensory experience of Z!!NGLES as it activates your salivary glands to release their refreshing flow of saliva.</p>
<p>Z!!NGLES is <i>available now</i> in naturally flavored spearmint, raspberry, or lemon!</p>

<p><i>""As a herbalist and natural health practitioner, I’m passionate about exploring our relationship with nature and the healing properties of plants.""</i> </p>
<p>I’ve been involved in the field of herbal medicine for over two decades, both as a practitioner and a consultant to herbal and natural product companies—though my passion for plants arose much earlier than this. Growing up in a rural setting, a backyard of 40 acres of wilderness in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia offered no end of natural wonders to a curious young mind: majestic cedars shared their timeless wisdom as I sat beneath them, while the ‘weeds’ that I walked amongst became familiar companions and messengers of healing. The verdant beauty of these natural surroundings inspired in me a deep and abiding love and reverence for nature which grows stronger with each passing season.<sup><a href=""http://www.paramnaturals.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank"">my personal site</a></sup></p>
<p>Prior to a return to greener roots, a 10+ year career as a medical lab technologist provided me with valuable insights into the benefits—and shortcomings—of conventional medicine, along with a comprehensive understanding of how the body functions, both in health and in disease. It also instilled in me the desire to better understand our body’s innate wisdom and profound intelligence to heal—<i>vis medicatrix naturae</i>—and the integral role that plants occupy in this regard. </p>

<hr/>
<p>Z!!NGLES grows out of an aspiration to answer a quite particular and pervasive distress. It's a no-nonsense, premium quality support for anyone who suffers from dry mouth, for those who have concerns about oral health, and for those wishing to optimize their well-being. </p>
<p>I'm also a filmmaker and media artist and, in previous lives, a university lecturer (Northwestern University, Chicago), a natural bread baker, a hospital orderly, a student of ancient Hindu temple architecture, a once-upon-a-time maker of goat milk kefir in northern California, a truck driver, and an essayist on digital futurism —amongst numerous other occupations. </p>
<p>My films and media art works have been featured at such venues as The Museum of Modern Art in NYC and the The Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona and at international film festivals from Amsterdam to Vancouver. My bread was happily eaten by many and the kefir was flavoured with biodynamic strawberries. <sup><a href=""http://shinynewfilms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank"">filmmaker site</a></sup>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Production: Due to economies of scale, each flavor requires a minimum production run of several hundred bottles. We must provide 50% of the cost, upfront, to our manufacturing partner when we place the purchase order, and the remaining 50% is due when production is complete. This is our biggest expenditure.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>Packaging: We use amber glass bottles for packaging, which are more costly than plastic.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Labels: Graphic design work + printing costs of additional label versions.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Shipping: Shipping costs are significantly higher with glass bottles, as they are heavier and much more fragile than plastic.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Warehouse &amp; Fulfillment: Includes receiving, storage, order processing and picking/packing, packaging materials, inventory management and associated account fees, all of which are invoiced and paid weekly.</li></ul>

<p>Z!!NGLES is a tangible product; yet, in its essence, a disruptive one. Oral care for dry mouth—a problem which affects literally tens of millions of Americans and many million of others worldwide—is serviced principally by a mega-corporate, complacent industry.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><b>Z!!NGLES' intent is to refresh not only your mouth, but the oral health care concept as a whole.</b></span></p>
<p>Depending upon the amount that our funding goal is exceeded:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>1. We'll increase our new flavors' production runs to their next volume pricing tier. This will improve our economies of scale which, in turn, improves our margin. We'll be able to pass these savings on to you with a reduction in retail price.</p>
<p>2. We have a full suite of organic and sustainable products envisioned to optimize your oral health care regime. With sufficient funding we'll be able to continue our R&amp;D on these products, as well as move forward on our ambitious longer-term objectives including:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Eco-friendly Refill (packaged in recyclable aluminum): Larger bulk size for refilling your spray bottles, with a bottle you can recycle or repurpose.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>Travel-size: Sleek and discreet for your pocket, purse, or backpack. Take it on-the-go!</li></ul>
<ul><li>Innovative Packaging: Stylish bottles that add an elegant esthetic, made with environmentally friendly materials such as recyclable aluminum or glass.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Organic Lozenge and Gum: Dry mouth and oral health support infused with spilanthol extract/jambu oleoresin, herbs, functional ingredients including xylitol, natural flavors.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Tea Blends: For dry mouth plus adjunct blends for sleep, relaxation (mind and body), memory support.</li></ul>

</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>If this is your first time using Z!!NGLES, we suggest to start conservatively, with just one spray. You may be surprised at how little you need!</p>
<p>Shake your bottle well and then spray once, directly into your mouth. Hold for 15-30 seconds, swirling the herbal around inside of your mouth to coat all of the oral surfaces, before swallowing.</p>
<p>A slight tingling or 'electrical' sensation is completely normal and a sign that the herbs are working to activate their refreshing flow of saliva! This sensation will subside after a few minutes. If you would prefer less 'intensity' of the tingle sensation, simply spray Z!!NGLES into a small amount of water or juice, and hold in your mouth for 15-30 seconds before swallowing.</p>
<p>If you would like more saliva release, repeat with another one-to-two sprays. The amount and frequency of use depends upon your individual needs, including the severity of your dry mouth.</p></span>

<span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><b>EXTRACTION</b></span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>Just as our premium herbs are of the highest quality, so too are the pure, natural solvents that we use for extraction: water, alcohol, and vegetable glycerin.</p>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.shinynewfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AAAABOTTLE.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 317px;""/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p>The water used for preparing our herbal extracts undergoes a 9-step filtration and purification process to create an ultra-pure water. The alcohol used is made from non-genetically modified corn, ensuring that Z!!NGLES is gluten-free, and our vegetable glycerin is derived from sustainably grown, SGS-certified palm fruit kernels.</p>
<p>Each individual herb in Z!!NGLES undergoes a dual-extraction process—an initial 24-hour maceration followed by cold-drip percolation—using precise concentrations and proportions of solvents and herbs to ensure the most potent and energetic extracts available. Some of our extracts then undergo a secondary phase in which the alcohol is gently removed and replaced with pure vegetable glycerin.</p>
<p>The individual herbal extracts are then combined in optimal proportions to create a synergistic, potent whole that is appreciably greater than the sum of its parts.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<hr/>
<span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><b>WHY DOES Z!!NGLES CONTAIN ALCOHOL?</b></span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p>Z!!NGLES contains a low amount (23%-33%) of alcohol in the finished product to preserve the full bioactivity and potency of our primary sialogogue herb, spilanthes.</p>
<p>During R&amp;D of Z!!NGLES, we compared versions of our proprietary formulation prepared with spilanthes as an alcohol extract, and versions with spilanthes prepared as a glycerite. We determined that the sialogogue action of our prototypes was <i>significantly</i> better when spilanthes was included as an alcohol extract, as compared to when it was included as a glycerite.</p>
<p>The low alcohol that remains in the finished product provides multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintains the mouthwatering sialogogue action of spilanthol, a unique bioactive compound in spilanthes;</li>
<li>enhances absorption of Z!!NGLES into the body more quickly and effectively; and,</li>
<li>provides a natural preservative system, enabling us to avoid using undesirable artificial and chemical preservatives.</li>
</ul></span>
</div>
<div>
<hr/>
<span style=""color: #4c4c4c;""><b>HOW LONG WILL A BOTTLE LAST?</b></span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">If you use Z!!NGLES a couple of times a day, three sprays each time, one bottle (2 fl oz) will last you two months—longer if you only use one-to-two sprays each time. There are almost 360 sprays per 2 fl oz bottle.</span>
</div>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Some may want to use Z!!NGLES more frequently, while others may need it only occasionally—it depends upon your personal needs. </span></p>
<p>We encourage you to experiment to find out what works best for you!<br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><i>Z!!NGLES doesn't require refrigeration (though it's best to keep your bottle out of direct heat or sunlight) and its shelf-life is a minimum of 5 years from date of manufacture.</i></span></p>

</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It would be considerably less expensive to bottle Z!!NGLES in plastic, but we believe that health—yours and the planet's—should not be compromised by a corporate bottom line. Plastic is not an optimal environmental choice, nor does it provide you with the highest quality and safety available.

<br/>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>Classic and time-tested, amber glass is inert—chemically nonreactive—and impermeable to oxygen, so it doesn’t interfere with or degrade any of the ingredients in Z!!NGLES or diminish their therapeutic benefits. Our carefully selected herbs maintain their premium quality, purity, and integrity, and the natural flavors we use remain true—not tainted with a ‘plastic taste.’</p></span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>Glass remains one of the most recyclable of packaging materials. It is made of a single material, which reduces energy and waste during production—and, when recycled, less by-products and waste are generated.</p>

And Just In — HurtGuru's Stellar Review!



Z!!NGLES is the effective, mouthwatering, organic herbal solution for your dry mouth and cotton mouth problems.

Meticulously developed and rigorously tested, Z!!NGLES' proprietary herbal formulation supports your body's innate salivation process by encouraging your salivary glands to produce and secrete more saliva, naturally. Z!!NGLES is also the perfect solution for anyone who relies upon their voice professionally, including singers, voice-over artists, teachers and public speakers.







Formulated by Paulina Nelega, Clinical Herbalist, professional member of the American Herbalists Guild and Canadian Herbalists Association of British Columbia.


Z!!NGLES is mindfully made with organically cultivated and ethically wildcrafted herbs and is manufactured in the USA in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility.

We've all experienced dry mouth at one time or another, whether from medications, 'cotton mouth,' a health condition, a therapeutic treatment, or dehydration. Or, we may have witnessed a loved one suffering from acute xerostomia (the medical term for dry mouth) during palliative care.

A conservative estimate of prevalence in the adult population is 20%, with over 40% of those 65 and older suffering from dry mouth.

When in full health, our mouth and throat are continuously moistened by salivary gland secretions. Along with keeping our mouth hydrated and feeling comfortable, saliva is vital for maintaining oral health: it's essential for the prevention of bacterial overgrowth that can lead to plaque formation and dental caries; it provides lubrication of the mouth and throat to aid in swallowing; and it helps maintain mineralization of the teeth. Saliva also contains enzymes which initiate the digestion of food, and antibodies that help keep our immune system strong.
















From the mildly annoying to the extremely painful, dry mouth is a notably undesirable condition with far-reaching, negative consequences for our entire well-being. Detrimental effects of chronic dry mouth can include:













So, we did our research.
We exhaustively studied the marketplace and scrutinized every product out there, taking particular care to discern the most important qualities of each: their effectiveness; their ingredients; how they tasted; and the quality of their mouthfeel. We also considered whether the company behind each product took a conventional or integrative, whole-world approach to health and well-being, including their position, or lack thereof, on sustainability.
We discovered that an authentically holistic dry mouth solution was woefully absent.
The current market-dominant dry mouth product line is made by one of the world's largest pharmaceutical corporations, and, in line with a behemoth pharmaceutical's bottomline philosophy, a herbal solution is far from its primary focus. Furthermore, not one of the products we looked at offered a genuinely mouthwatering (saliva-inducing) experience. Considering that dry mouth is often a daily issue for many, we were inspired to create an authentic—and decidedly effective—herbal solution for dry mouth.



We examined the problem systematically.
We brainstormed with our network of colleagues and herbalists and mentors; we consulted with ethnobotanists; we tracked down obscure scientific papers; we learned from food flavor gurus; we made teas and tinctures and chewed the raw herbs; we tested and retested numerous herbal combinations and formulated and reformulated prototypes. Much time and many versions later, we bring you:


The powerful organic botanical solution for dry mouth.












Organic spilanthes, also known as the 'electric button' plant, is the primary herb in Z!!NGLES. As its common name suggests, spilanthes imparts a notable tingling or 'electrical buzzing' sensation on the tongue and within the oral cavity.




Perhaps less well-known is that spilanthes is one of the botanical world's most powerful sialogogues—a substance that induces saliva production.
Both its mouth-tingling and saliva-inducing effects are due to a unique and potent bioactive compound called spilanthol.





Spilanthol, due to its particular molecular structure, activates ion channels in the cell membranes of nerve fiber receptors on the tongue and within the oral cavity. Activation of these ion channels causes an exchange of charged ions between the inside and outside of the cell which, in turn, generates an electrical signal on the surface of the nerve cell fiber—a “vibratory chemesthetic sensation.” That’s wow!



This electrical message is relayed along the nerve fibers and evokes a response from the trigeminal and facial nerves, which subsequently signal the salivary glands to produce and release saliva.


Voilà! Z!!NG Z!!NGLES!

Spilanthol stimulates our body's innate salivation response and triggers the 'electrifreshening' tingling sensation experienced with Z!!NGLES.





Spilanthes (Spilanthes acmella) — Madeleine Françoise Basseporte (1701-1780)

From its origins in South America, spilanthes has since become widely distributed and cultivated for its rare and highly valued medicinal properties.

 


Used for millennia by indigenous healers from the Amazon to Thailand to the Hindu Kush, scientific studies have now confirmed spilanthes' significant antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antiprotozoal properties, in addition to its beneficial sialogogue action.1

In India, spilanthes has long-been integrated into Ayurvedic medicine under its Sanskrit name Sarahattika and is used to support the immune system, improve digestion, treat headaches, relieve toothaches, heal infections of the throat and gums, and alleviate nausea.
Common names include the electric button plant, electric daisy, toothache plant, peek-a-boo plant, eyeball plant, buzz button, and other local names.
































Colloquially known as 'cotton mouth,' cannabis-induced dry mouth affects virtually everyone who consumes cannabis, whether medicinally or recreationally, and whether by vaping, smoking, or eating it.
       

It was only in 2006 that scientists identified the mechanism behind cannabis-induced dry mouth.8 
Specific receptors within the salivary glands and the brain—endocannabinoid receptors—are activated by the phytocannabinoid THC in cannabis. When THC binds to our endocannabinoid receptors, the salivary glands are inhibited from receiving their customary message to produce saliva.


Z!!NGLES is the persuasive, potent herbal counterbalance to the uncomfortable and ultimately harmful side effect of cotton mouth.












One of the many advantages of herbs over single-chemical drugs is that they are
complex and multidimensional.  Each herb features a diverse array of compounds that affect the body simultaneously, providing multiple benefits. For example, though our primary herb spilanthes is principally used for its oral health benefits, it is also a superbly effective antimicrobial.When herbs are combined with one another, the element of herbal synergy also comes into play. Interactions amongst each plants' multiple components occurs, potentiating the effect of the whole.
Z!!NGLES' synergistic formulation provides benefits beyond dry mouth relief:

Exposure to airborne viruses is inevitable, especially in crowded places such as airplanes and public transportation. Keep a bottle of Z!!NGLES handy when you're flying or traveling to maintain healthy mouth and throat hydration, which helps protect from colds and flu. You can also use Z!!NGLES anytime you feel a sore throat coming on. 
Singers and public speakers, take note! Z!!NGLES is the ideal solution for the rigors of every professional singer, public speaker, teacher or voice-over artist. If your career demands you use your voice constantly, there's no better way to protect it than with Z!!NGLES. Z!!NGLES immediately and reliably encourages saliva flow to maintain mouth hydration, ease dry throat discomfort, and eliminate raspy hoarseness. Speak or sing with the secure certainty of feeling and sounding your most confident best.
Saliva is vitally important for digestion, and Z!!NGLES helps to get yours flowing! Saliva provides lubrication for swallowing, contains enzymes that initiate the digestive process, and protects vitamin B12 from stomach acid. Use Z!!NGLES before or after a meal to help support healthy digestion.

Bad breath? Freshen your breath throughout the day—a quick spray or two before a meeting or a date, or during a workout, will enliven your mouth and refresh your breath. [Note: Bad breath (halitosis) is something that we all experience from time-to-time; however, chronic halitosis can be an indicator of other underlying health issues—a visit to your doctor to find out the cause is recommended.] 
The importance of oral health extends beyond the mouth. An interesting recent study suggests an association between oral health and Alzheimer disease: of those individuals with Alzheimer who also had gum disease, there was a six-fold increase in the rate of cognitive decline over a six-month period.7  


It's a kind of venerable, old-school classic herbal elixir. With a modern update.Z!!NGLES' host of flavor subtleties and natural sweetness arise from its complex blend of organic herbs, natural flavors and essential oils, xylitol, and vegetable glycerin, all of which modulate the profile and taste characteristics of Z!!NGLES.

Spilanthes itself has a light citrus and herbal-green, sparkling clean taste along with a notable tingling 'buzzing' sensation—followed quickly by a reliable flow of saliva. This sensation is normal (and a sign that the herbs in Z!!NGLES are working!) and will subside after a few minutes. Feel into the unique sensory experience of Z!!NGLES as it activates your salivary glands to release their refreshing flow of saliva.
Z!!NGLES is available now in naturally flavored spearmint, raspberry, or lemon!




With your help, we'll offer mango, chocolate-cherry, and classic, too!

""As a herbalist and natural health practitioner, I’m passionate about exploring our relationship with nature and the healing properties of plants."" 
I’ve been involved in the field of herbal medicine for over two decades, both as a practitioner and a consultant to herbal and natural product companies—though my passion for plants arose much earlier than this. Growing up in a rural setting, a backyard of 40 acres of wilderness in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia offered no end of natural wonders to a curious young mind: majestic cedars shared their timeless wisdom as I sat beneath them, while the ‘weeds’ that I walked amongst became familiar companions and messengers of healing. The verdant beauty of these natural surroundings inspired in me a deep and abiding love and reverence for nature which grows stronger with each passing season.my personal site
Prior to a return to greener roots, a 10+ year career as a medical lab technologist provided me with valuable insights into the benefits—and shortcomings—of conventional medicine, along with a comprehensive understanding of how the body functions, both in health and in disease. It also instilled in me the desire to better understand our body’s innate wisdom and profound intelligence to heal—vis medicatrix naturae—and the integral role that plants occupy in this regard. 
I'm thrilled to introduce Z!!NGLES and our exclusive Indiegogo Perks to you!








Z!!NGLES grows out of an aspiration to answer a quite particular and pervasive distress. It's a no-nonsense, premium quality support for anyone who suffers from dry mouth, for those who have concerns about oral health, and for those wishing to optimize their well-being. 
I'm also a filmmaker and media artist and, in previous lives, a university lecturer (Northwestern University, Chicago), a natural bread baker, a hospital orderly, a student of ancient Hindu temple architecture, a once-upon-a-time maker of goat milk kefir in northern California, a truck driver, and an essayist on digital futurism —amongst numerous other occupations. 
My films and media art works have been featured at such venues as The Museum of Modern Art in NYC and the The Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona and at international film festivals from Amsterdam to Vancouver. My bread was happily eaten by many and the kefir was flavoured with biodynamic strawberries. filmmaker site

We've self-financed Z!!NGLES to date, including successfully completing our first production run of three flavors—spearmint, lemon, and raspberry—this spring.
We're seeking funding of $12,000 to bring three additional Z!!NGLES flavors to you by fall 2016.
When you pledge to support our project you can be assured that we'll deliver on the great Perks we've got lined up for you, with our inventory freshly on hand and ready to ship!
Because we've already navigated the process from start-to-finish, we bring a clear understanding of what is needed and the expenses involved. The funding that we receive will be used to cover costs for:


Production: Due to economies of scale, each flavor requires a minimum production run of several hundred bottles. We must provide 50% of the cost, upfront, to our manufacturing partner when we place the purchase order, and the remaining 50% is due when production is complete. This is our biggest expenditure.

Packaging: We use amber glass bottles for packaging, which are more costly than plastic.
Labels: Graphic design work + printing costs of additional label versions.
Shipping: Shipping costs are significantly higher with glass bottles, as they are heavier and much more fragile than plastic.
Warehouse & Fulfillment: Includes receiving, storage, order processing and picking/packing, packaging materials, inventory management and associated account fees, all of which are invoiced and paid weekly.
Promotional including social media outreach.

Indiegogo campaign fees, payment transaction fees, Perks' shipping.






Z!!NGLES will deliver the goods on every Perk pledged, as we've bootstrapped the first production run of three flavors, ourselves—we're ready to start shipping now!

































Z!!NGLES is a tangible product; yet, in its essence, a disruptive one. Oral care for dry mouth—a problem which affects literally tens of millions of Americans and many million of others worldwide—is serviced principally by a mega-corporate, complacent industry.
Z!!NGLES' intent is to refresh not only your mouth, but the oral health care concept as a whole.
Depending upon the amount that our funding goal is exceeded:

1. We'll increase our new flavors' production runs to their next volume pricing tier. This will improve our economies of scale which, in turn, improves our margin. We'll be able to pass these savings on to you with a reduction in retail price.
2. We have a full suite of organic and sustainable products envisioned to optimize your oral health care regime. With sufficient funding we'll be able to continue our R&D on these products, as well as move forward on our ambitious longer-term objectives including:


Eco-friendly Refill (packaged in recyclable aluminum): Larger bulk size for refilling your spray bottles, with a bottle you can recycle or repurpose.

Travel-size: Sleek and discreet for your pocket, purse, or backpack. Take it on-the-go!
Innovative Packaging: Stylish bottles that add an elegant esthetic, made with environmentally friendly materials such as recyclable aluminum or glass.
Organic Lozenge and Gum: Dry mouth and oral health support infused with spilanthol extract/jambu oleoresin, herbs, functional ingredients including xylitol, natural flavors.
Tea Blends: For dry mouth plus adjunct blends for sleep, relaxation (mind and body), memory support.
'Electric Marshmallows': A fun—and functional—novel treat made with organic marshmallow root, spilanthes, xylitol and natural flavors. 
Rehydrating Effervescent Beverage: Compressed tablet or powder containing spilanthol, herbs, xylitol and other functional ingredients, plus natural flavors. Just add water or juice for delicious, instant rehydration.
Mouthwash, Toothpaste: Herbal-formulated dental and oral health support.
Ancillary Products: Dental floss, tongue scraper infused with spilanthol.
R&D on: 1. Terpene-enriched products for synergistic ‘entourage effect’ of cannabinoids; and 2. Proprietary herbal formulation to counter the short-term memory impairment associated with cannabis use.
Clinical Study: Collaborate with clinical research facility to measure Z!!NGLES' effectiveness: 1. Quantify the increase in rate of saliva flow and amount of saliva produced. 2. Measure duration that sialogogue effect is maintained. 3. Determine if there is cumulative improvement of salivary gland function with regular use. 4. Additional information and confirmation regarding the antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal profile of Z!!NGLES.



WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T REACH OUR CAMPAIGN GOAL? 
We'll use the funds received towards production of one or two (depending upon amount received) additional new flavors, as well as continue our ongoing research and development of the Z!!NGLES products we're actively working on. We'll also continue our promotional and outreach efforts to strengthen and build the community we are serving.

IS Z!!NGLES EFFECTIVE FOR DRY MOUTH CAUSED BY MEDICATIONS?


Yes! For individuals taking prescription medications, especially multiple 
prescriptions, dry mouth side effect is extremely common.

Z!!NGLES brings immediate moisturizing relief to medication-induced xerostomia.With its unique formulation of powerful sialogogue herbs, Z!!NGLES supports the body's own production of saliva to quickly and naturally rehydrate and moisturize your mouth.




WHAT ABOUT RADIATION THERAPY-INDUCED DRY MOUTH?



Loss of saliva is one of the most common complaints amongst patients who have received radiation therapy of the head and neck. Radiation-induced xerostomia contributes to oral health complications including periodontal infection and dental caries.
Z!!NGLES is formulated to address the issue of dry mouth, no matter the cause.




CAN Z!!NGLES HELP SJÖGREN'S SYNDROME SUFFERERS?



Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease in which the body's white blood cells damage the moisture-producing glands of the body, including the salivary glands. This causes decreased saliva production and subsequent dry mouth (and complications thereof).
    
Approximately 4 million Americans are afflicted with Sjögren's syndrome. Because the disorder may be difficult to diagnose, the incidence of the disease may be considerably higher. To date, there is no cure for Sjögren's syndrome, and treatment remains symptomatic—aimed at relieving the symptoms.
Z!!NGLES offers effective relief for mild-to-moderate dry mouth associated with Sjögren's syndrome. 



MY SLEEP IS OFTEN DISRUPTED BECAUSE OF DRY MOUTH DISCOMFORT. CAN Z!!NGLES HELP?
Saliva production is greatest during waking hours and naturally diminishes during sleep—dropping off to almost nothing. This process is regulated by our body's circadian rhythm. Having an extremely dry mouth and killer thirst during the night can cause you to awaken repeatedly, compromising your ability to get the zzz's you need to feel and be your best. Snoring or sleep apnea can further aggravate dry mouth at night.
Z!!NGLES helps nighttime dry mouth by stimulating saliva production so that your mouth feels instantly moisturized and comfortable. Keep a bottle on your nightstand for fast-acting relief—and you can get back to getting the rest you need.



MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED MEDICATION TO INCREASE MY SALIVA FLOW. CAN I USE Z!!NGLES INSTEAD?


Many common prescription medications used to increase saliva flow have undesirable side effects such as excessive sweating or nausea, or more dangerous risks such as arrhythmia. Z!!NGLES offers a natural and holistic option to support your body's innate salivation process.



 We encourage you to discuss with your doctor whether Z!!NGLES may be  suitable for you; however, we cannot recommend that you discontinue any medication you may have been prescribed.






CAN Z!!NGLES BE USED REGULARLY?


Yes! There is no build up or ‘tolerance’ to the ingredients in Z!!NGLES. You’ll experience the same beneficial results no matter how many times you use it. 






Additionally, the herbs in our formulations have been safely used by millions of humans for millennia. 


Please note: If you are pregnant, nursing, taking any medications, or have any health condition, please consult your doctor before using any herbal or dietary supplement.




HOW DO I USE Z!!NGLES MOST EFFECTIVELY?


If this is your first time using Z!!NGLES, we suggest to start conservatively, with just one spray. You may be surprised at how little you need!
Shake your bottle well and then spray once, directly into your mouth. Hold for 15-30 seconds, swirling the herbal around inside of your mouth to coat all of the oral surfaces, before swallowing.
A slight tingling or 'electrical' sensation is completely normal and a sign that the herbs are working to activate their refreshing flow of saliva! This sensation will subside after a few minutes. If you would prefer less 'intensity' of the tingle sensation, simply spray Z!!NGLES into a small amount of water or juice, and hold in your mouth for 15-30 seconds before swallowing.
If you would like more saliva release, repeat with another one-to-two sprays. The amount and frequency of use depends upon your individual needs, including the severity of your dry mouth.


WHAT ABOUT QUALITY?  

We use the finest organically cultivated and sustainably wild-harvested herbs, picked and processed at their peak of potency, and we do not use endangered or at-risk plants from the wild. Additionally, our herbs are never fumigated, irradiated, or sprayed with pesticides or herbicides. We work only with established, reputable botanical suppliers who fulfill strict vendor qualifications that are part of the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) certification process.







WHAT IS GMP MANUFACTURING?


Quality control regulations known as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) are: 


""... guidelines that provide a system of processes, procedures and documentation to assure a product has the identity, strength, composition, quality and purity that appear on its label.""
10 










Our manufacturing partner is GMP-certified, FDA-registered, and a Certified Organic Goods (COG) facility, and has been in operation for over three decades. 

GMPs are diligently adhered to during every stage of our manufacturing process, with documentation of each step maintained from start to finish. Upon arrival at the facility, all raw materials are placed in quarantine where they undergo identity and purity testing to ensure correct botanical identification and to rule out adulteration. Finished products undergo rigorous quality assurance testing including microbiological and heavy metal analysis, and sample retention for stability.





EXTRACTION


Just as our premium herbs are of the highest quality, so too are the pure, natural solvents that we use for extraction: water, alcohol, and vegetable glycerin.


The water used for preparing our herbal extracts undergoes a 9-step filtration and purification process to create an ultra-pure water. The alcohol used is made from non-genetically modified corn, ensuring that Z!!NGLES is gluten-free, and our vegetable glycerin is derived from sustainably grown, SGS-certified palm fruit kernels.
Each individual herb in Z!!NGLES undergoes a dual-extraction process—an initial 24-hour maceration followed by cold-drip percolation—using precise concentrations and proportions of solvents and herbs to ensure the most potent and energetic extracts available. Some of our extracts then undergo a secondary phase in which the alcohol is gently removed and replaced with pure vegetable glycerin.
The individual herbal extracts are then combined in optimal proportions to create a synergistic, potent whole that is appreciably greater than the sum of its parts.





WHY DOES Z!!NGLES CONTAIN ALCOHOL?



Z!!NGLES contains a low amount (23%-33%) of alcohol in the finished product to preserve the full bioactivity and potency of our primary sialogogue herb, spilanthes.
During R&D of Z!!NGLES, we compared versions of our proprietary formulation prepared with spilanthes as an alcohol extract, and versions with spilanthes prepared as a glycerite. We determined that the sialogogue action of our prototypes was significantly better when spilanthes was included as an alcohol extract, as compared to when it was included as a glycerite.
The low alcohol that remains in the finished product provides multiple benefits:

maintains the mouthwatering sialogogue action of spilanthol, a unique bioactive compound in spilanthes;
enhances absorption of Z!!NGLES into the body more quickly and effectively; and,
provides a natural preservative system, enabling us to avoid using undesirable artificial and chemical preservatives.




HOW LONG WILL A BOTTLE LAST?


If you use Z!!NGLES a couple of times a day, three sprays each time, one bottle (2 fl oz) will last you two months—longer if you only use one-to-two sprays each time. There are almost 360 sprays per 2 fl oz bottle.






Some may want to use Z!!NGLES more frequently, while others may need it only occasionally—it depends upon your personal needs. 
We encourage you to experiment to find out what works best for you!
Z!!NGLES doesn't require refrigeration (though it's best to keep your bottle out of direct heat or sunlight) and its shelf-life is a minimum of 5 years from date of manufacture.




WHY DO WE BOTTLE IN GLASS?


It would be considerably less expensive to bottle Z!!NGLES in plastic, but we believe that health—yours and the planet's—should not be compromised by a corporate bottom line. Plastic is not an optimal environmental choice, nor does it provide you with the highest quality and safety available. Glass is the only packaging material that the FDA ranks as ""Generally Regarded As Safe"" (GRAS).






Classic and time-tested, amber glass is inert—chemically nonreactive—and impermeable to oxygen, so it doesn’t interfere with or degrade any of the ingredients in Z!!NGLES or diminish their therapeutic benefits. Our carefully selected herbs maintain their premium quality, purity, and integrity, and the natural flavors we use remain true—not tainted with a ‘plastic taste.’


Glass remains one of the most recyclable of packaging materials. It is made of a single material, which reduces energy and waste during production—and, when recycled, less by-products and waste are generated.

<p> No Cheating and Less Injury: A critical benefit of elastic resistance is that it prevents the user from “cheating” on the Gorilla Bow Resistance Band Training exercise being performed. The physical properties of elastic resistance devices do not allow the user to cheat by using momentum. This is because the resistance from the elastic equipment comes from the stretching of the resistance bands and not the mass of the equipment. The only way to continue a movement while performing resistance band exercises is to utilize more muscle fibers in the exercising muscle to continue stretching the elastic material. This also helps prevent injuries from occurring.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497063528/wgxhqpmhelhgtd5dmhru.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Joint Friendly: Repeated joint compression and lack of joint stabilization is what ultimately breaks down joint surfaces. Resistance bands create significantly less joint compression because they use tension instead of gravity, like free weights. Therefore, bands can train using horizontal and rotational forces which create far less joint compression. Essentially band training eliminates having to always train muscles using the same patterns of movement which in turn is far more joint friendly.</p>

</div></div>","Gorilla Bow easily adjusts to your exercise needs regardless of your skill level or fitness goal. The four resistance bands create anything from 5 lbs up to 200 lbs of resistance.


Forget being stuck at the gym, Gorilla Bow is lightweight and convenient to take anywhere. 


With Gorilla Bow, you'll save time and burn more calories than with other traditional workouts like running. We'll give you step by step instructions for our specially designed High Intensity Interval Training that will help you get the results you want.

Forget spending hours at the gym. You'll see more progress by fitting in 15 minutes of HIIT three times a week than you would jogging on the treadmill an hour everyday!

Research shows that the exertion from our workouts causes your muscles to need more repair time. As a result, you'll burn more calories and fat while you're exercising and continue to burn the calories and fat during the repair cycle — up to 24 hours post workout!!!

We'll also be in touch with healthy recipes and other lifestyle tips along the way so you can stay on track for a healthier fitter you!


We provide continuous workouts, motivation, and education to maximize your results!

You'll get free exercise videos!
 No Cheating and Less Injury: A critical benefit of elastic resistance is that it prevents the user from “cheating” on the Gorilla Bow Resistance Band Training exercise being performed. The physical properties of elastic resistance devices do not allow the user to cheat by using momentum. This is because the resistance from the elastic equipment comes from the stretching of the resistance bands and not the mass of the equipment. The only way to continue a movement while performing resistance band exercises is to utilize more muscle fibers in the exercising muscle to continue stretching the elastic material. This also helps prevent injuries from occurring.

Joint Friendly: Repeated joint compression and lack of joint stabilization is what ultimately breaks down joint surfaces. Resistance bands create significantly less joint compression because they use tension instead of gravity, like free weights. Therefore, bands can train using horizontal and rotational forces which create far less joint compression. Essentially band training eliminates having to always train muscles using the same patterns of movement which in turn is far more joint friendly.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4>Q. Is there any possibility of Electrocution?</h4>
<p>A. Absolutely 100% not! The Glov uses a super low voltage and low amperage power source so even if you touched the ends of an exposed connection you would not feel a thing. Now if you are a mad sexual scientist and are looking to get more kick out of The Glov and contemplate hooking it up to your 5000 watt generator well...let's just say you need to urgently seek some professional help ;)</p>
<h4>Q. Will my hand get all sweaty?</h4>
<p>A. Well, that really depends on you and how you use it! Statistics show that the average masturbation session lasts only 10-12 minutes so you could have slight perspiration like you would normally expect. Now if you like to play in the shower getting a little damp is part of the fun!</p>
<h4>Q. Does The Glov come in different colors?</h4>
<p>A. Yes, it comes in Purple and Fuchsia.  </p>
<h4>Q. Is The Glov waterproof?</h4>
<p>A. Yes it is. You can get it wet so using it in the shower is OK. It is not recommend that it be submerged in a bathtub or hot tub though.  </p>
<h4>Q: What attachment options do I have?</h4>
<p>A: The attachments we have right now are the Rabbit and the Dildo. We will be adding new attachment options on a regular basis.</p>
<h4>Q: Are the attachments motorized?</h4>

<h4>Q: Do you warranty The Glov</h4>
<p>A: Yes we give a 1-year, no hassle warranty for all our products</p>
<h4>Q: Why do you not have a left hand glove?</h4>
<p>A: We do not have a left hand glove at this time because 90% of the population is right handed and due to costs associated with making a left hand glove we have decided to hold off making one for now. We will be offering one in the near future.</p>
<h4>Q: How do I know when the battery is getting low?</h4>
<p>A: When the battery is below 20% a little red light will turn on indicating that the battery needs to be charged soon.</p>
<h4>Q: Can I get the attachment in other colors?</h4>
<p>A: Not at this time. This is due to the fact that we have a minimum number of attachments we have to produce for each production run so we need to keep tight controls on costs vs volumes. I can assure you we will offer other colors in the near future.</p>
<h4>Q: What will the Indiegogo funds raised be used for?</h4>
<p>A: The funds will be used for the first manufacturing and production run of The Glov.</p>
<h4>Q: When will you ship me The Glov?</h4>

<div>
<h4>Q: Do you ship internationally?</h4>A: Yes of course. We want all our neighbors to have as much fun as are having. There is a slight additional charge though – Canada $10 and all other countries $25.</div>

<h4>Q: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?</h4>A: That depends on the woodchuck.</div>

A: Not at this time. This is due to the fact that we have a minimum number of attachments we have to produce for each production run so we need to keep tight controls on costs vs volumes. I can assure you we will offer other colors in the near future.
Q: What will the Indiegogo funds raised be used for?
A: The funds will be used for the first manufacturing and production run of The Glov.
Q: When will you ship me The Glov?
A: Once the campaign closes we need up to 90 days to manufacture, produce, test and ship the product to you. We will keep you completely up to date throughout the whole process.
Q: When will I be charged for The Glov
A: Generally if you are using a Credit Card it will show on your statement within 2 business days. If you are paying with PayPal it will be instant up to 5 days depending on how you use your PP account.
Q: How does the purchase appear on a credit card bill or bank statement?A: The purchase will appear on any bill or statement as G-Lovin Enterprises LLC.

Q: Do I need to sign up for PayPal to donate?A: No!  Any standard credit or debit card can be used through the PayPal gateway.  Simply select the choice for people who do not have a PayPal account and enter your credit card information as you normally would.

Q: How can I contact you?A: The best method is via email at – support@glovinlife.com One of our customer service representatives will get back to you within 48 hours.

Q: Do you ship internationally?A: Yes of course. We want all our neighbors to have as much fun as are having. There is a slight additional charge though – Canada $10 and all other countries $25.

Q: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?A: That depends on the woodchuck.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>(design prototype)</p>
</div>
<p>Figure Out Food is a mobile app to help you figure out <b>what to eat to be healthy</b> <span style=""color: black; font-weight: normal;"">and</span> <b>how to tell if it's working</b>. No diets or medical tests required. It connects what you eat to specific signs of health so you learn what actually works for you, not what experts claim or one-size-fits-all diets say <i>should</i> work for you.</p>
<p>The app gives you an easy and effective way to measure your health after eating so you can tell whether what you are eating is working for you, and, over time, build your own personalized diet. It puts you back in control of your diet and health.</p>
<p>Figure Out Food redefines health and simplifies good nutrition into practical terms and a process you can follow to optimize your health <b>now</b>. It focuses on health first, not diets, and uses your own experiences to guide you to better health.</p>
<blockquote>
""People need this app"" —Adele HIte, RD, MPH <br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>""the emphasis should be on measuring health, not weight""—Traci Mann, University of Minnesota</blockquote>
<blockquote>""Measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so""<br/>—Galileo Galilei</blockquote>
<blockquote>""The Board considers it scientifically unsound to make single, all-inclusive recommendations to the public regarding intakes of energy, protein, fat, cholesterol, carbohydrate, fiber, and sodium. Needs for energy and essential nutrients vary with age, sex, physiological state, hereditary factors, physical activity, and the state of health."" —Toward Healthful Diets, Food and Nutrition Board, NAS, 1980
</blockquote>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Figure Out Food helps you figure out what to eat to be healthy by connecting what you eat to how you feel to see if it's working. Eat what you want and take an experimental attitude to eating. Try standard diet plans, your favorite foods, or whatever you want. Figure out the best diet for you with your own data. Simple. </p>
<h3>Take Lunch Photo</h3>
<p>You take a photo of your lunch everyday (before you eat it) with the camera function of the app, then set the app to remind you to rate how well it's working for you a few hours later.
</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1162305/files/20150120091124-Mon.Lunch-IMG_1422a50pct.jpg?1421773884"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Lunch?</h3>
<p>Of course, it doesn't have to just be lunch that you track. Lunch was chosen first, because for most people, lunch is the meal they have least control over, time-wise and content-wise. This usually makes lunch the most challenging meal of the day to get right, but with the most impact on the rest of your day.</p>
<p>So start with lunch, but expand to track all your meals, and snacks, if you want. The more you learn about how different foods affect you, the better off you'll be.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Measure Your Health</h3><div>Rate yourself in five key health signs at 1, 2, and 3 hours after lunch (or whatever custom times you prefer). Each score is saved and tracked over time with the meal so you can mentally connect what you eat with its effects on you.</div>

<h3>Get Started with the Simplified Guide to Nutrition</h3>
<p>If you don't know where to begin and need help getting started, the app has a built-in guide to Simplified Nutrition. Everyone needs some basic nutrition knowledge so they have a base from which to start experimenting with their foods and diets,</p>
<p>The Simplified Nutrition section of the app is based on principles developed by the Healthy Nation Coalition (HNC) regarding adequate essential nutrition. The Healthy Nation Coalition is run by Executive Director, Adele Hite. Check out their website, <a href=""http://forahealthynation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: purple;"" target=""_blank"">Healthy Nation Coalition</a> and see the great work they are doing.</p>
<h3>Build Your Own Personalized Diet</h3>
<p>It's personal nutrition, using your own data to build your customized diet for the 21st century. No need to rely on fad diets or experts who change their minds every other week. Use the power of technology to create better health for yourself, every day. Share your results with friends and learn from the crowd to accelerate your learning curve.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Identify foods and diet patterns that work</li>
<li>Share with friends; Learn from the crowd</li>
<li>Browse your history of what works</li>
<li>See your best and worst meals</li>
<li>Get recommendations that work for you</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gradually build a database of what works for you—your own dietary guidelines—and regain the intuition to know what works for you.</p>
<h2>Why Figure Out Food Works</h2>
<p>The real key is defining health in a way that you can easily understand, self-assess, observe, record, and tie back to the foods you've eaten. It's about redefining health and healthy eating.</p>
<p>Redefining health, however, does mean changing your health perspective from risk factors, longevity, and chronic disease prevention, to “How am I feeling right now?” “Am I operating at my best?” “If not, let's figure out the cause and fix it.”</p>
<p>Redefining healthy eating means no one-size-fits-all diets or Dietary Guidelines, but figure out food and eat what works best for you, not anyone else. It's reinventing the process of eating for health, by focusing on health first (""begin with the end in mind"") and working backwards from feeling great to what you ate.</p>
<p>Figure Out Food redefines health into two key concepts:  Health Signs and Health Now. Health Now is what we want. Health Signs are the measurement tools we use.</p>
<h3>Health Signs</h3>
<p>Health Signs are a new, simple way of self-assessed health measurement. Health Signs are a way to quantify wellness and feeling healthy, feeling good, feeling well, right now—an innovative new way to measure health. Health Signs are a direct measurement of health.</p>
<p>Health Signs are a checklist of high-level indicators of health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Mood</li>
<li>Concentration</li>
<li>Bloating</li>
<li>Hunger</li>
</ul>
<p>These high-level health indicators were specifically selected to cover the full range of how you feel, mentally and physically, and each one encapsulates lower-level body signs and reactions. High-level signs motivate you to take meaningful action, whereas you typically just try to ignore or avoid dealing with lower-level signs. </p>
<h3>Health Now</h3>
<div>The Health Promotion era officially started decades ago, but we seem to be stuck in the Prevention era. The WHO Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, 1986, says,</div>
<blockquote>Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health.</blockquote>
<p>Instead of asking what causes disease, ask ""What causes health?"" Instead of worrying about what causes disease, change your perspective to focus on what causes health. Instead of prevention, focus on health promotion. Instead of worrying about longevity, focus on what you can do to produce health today, health now. </p>
<p>To read more about Health Now and why it's better than the prevention paradigm, see my blog post, <a href=""https://figureoutfood.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/health-now-causing-health/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: purple;"" target=""_blank"">Health Now</a>.
</p>
<h3>Figure Out Food is a process, not a diet plan</h3>
<p>Eating is just one part of the process of nutrition. Nutrition is a process, not just what you eat at discrete times of the day, that you can then forget about. If you want good health, you have to see nutrition as a continuous process, of which eating is just a small part, but a very important part.</p>
<p>Good nutrition is the process of eating the right foods, digesting them well, absorbing them well, metabolizing them well, and easily and comfortably excreting the waste products—all leading to and contributing to smooth functioning of the overall body and mind, with good energy and mood, clear thinking, and an overall feeling of wellness.</p>
<p>Figure Out Food is an ongoing process of testing, experimenting, adapting, and learning. Our food world is not static, so your diet must be dynamic and adapt to changing circumstances. Figure Out Food teaches you how to listen to your body and answer this simple question: <b>""What did I eat to make me feel like this?""</b> When you know how foods will make you feel, you are back in control of your health.</p>

<div>
<p>Why do I care so much about health and nutrition and health?</p>
<p>Years ago, I tried the conventional wisdom on diet and health, the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and instead of making me feel better and healthier, they actually turned me into a pre-diabetic! Instead of solving my health issues, following the Food Pyramid made me feel worse, not better.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I said to myself, </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">this can't be right!</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>That's when I realized that experts are not always right and one-size-fits-all diets are not the answer. I decided to figure out a better way to learn what to eat to be healthy. So I started looking for other ideas and trying different ways of eating to find out what worked best for me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It has taken me over 15 years to really figure out food and I'm still learning. It's an ongoing process because our food world is constantly changing. But I have figured out enough to know that I'm ready to share my system with you so you can figure out food too.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is for you to figure out and understand food and how it makes you feel and affects your health.</p>
<h3>My Background</h3>
<p>I have been figuring things out all my life, starting with all kinds of puzzles as a youngster, progressing to competing nationally in mathematics and computer science in high school, tackling physics in college, and creating and troubleshooting software of all sizes and shapes, from small benchmark programs to corporate enterprise software consulting and troubleshooting. </p>
<p>I've been a software developer and consultant most of my professional life, but for the past decade my real passion has been learning about nutrition and health. In other words, how to program yourself with food for better health.</p>

(design prototype)

Figure Out Food is a mobile app to help you figure out what to eat to be healthy and how to tell if it's working. No diets or medical tests required. It connects what you eat to specific signs of health so you learn what actually works for you, not what experts claim or one-size-fits-all diets say should work for you.
The app gives you an easy and effective way to measure your health after eating so you can tell whether what you are eating is working for you, and, over time, build your own personalized diet. It puts you back in control of your diet and health.
Figure Out Food redefines health and simplifies good nutrition into practical terms and a process you can follow to optimize your health now. It focuses on health first, not diets, and uses your own experiences to guide you to better health.

""People need this app"" —Adele HIte, RD, MPH 

""the emphasis should be on measuring health, not weight""—Traci Mann, University of Minnesota
""Measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so""—Galileo Galilei
""The Board considers it scientifically unsound to make single, all-inclusive recommendations to the public regarding intakes of energy, protein, fat, cholesterol, carbohydrate, fiber, and sodium. Needs for energy and essential nutrients vary with age, sex, physiological state, hereditary factors, physical activity, and the state of health."" —Toward Healthful Diets, Food and Nutrition Board, NAS, 1980

How It Works
Figure Out Food helps you figure out what to eat to be healthy by connecting what you eat to how you feel to see if it's working. Eat what you want and take an experimental attitude to eating. Try standard diet plans, your favorite foods, or whatever you want. Figure out the best diet for you with your own data. Simple. 
Take Lunch Photo
You take a photo of your lunch everyday (before you eat it) with the camera function of the app, then set the app to remind you to rate how well it's working for you a few hours later.




Why Lunch?
Of course, it doesn't have to just be lunch that you track. Lunch was chosen first, because for most people, lunch is the meal they have least control over, time-wise and content-wise. This usually makes lunch the most challenging meal of the day to get right, but with the most impact on the rest of your day.
So start with lunch, but expand to track all your meals, and snacks, if you want. The more you learn about how different foods affect you, the better off you'll be.

Measure Your HealthRate yourself in five key health signs at 1, 2, and 3 hours after lunch (or whatever custom times you prefer). Each score is saved and tracked over time with the meal so you can mentally connect what you eat with its effects on you.

3:00 pm Monday

See What Works
Over time, you learn from your own data, seeing the trends in history and graphs, with the ability to review how different meals made you feel and perform afterwards.








Track Health Signs Over Time
See how your health signs vary by day and time. You can always go back and see what you ate that produced these health sign ratings. Use your data to learn to predict and produce the better health you want, like more energy and less hunger.

This campaign has been set up to help Tricia offset some of the costs for her treatment and the long road to rehabilitation. How it all started...In 2008 Tricia Moses a charismatic, caring and devoted teacher at P.S. 233 in East Flatbush, Brooklyn NY was diagnosed with Scleroderma, a disabling connective tissue disease that in it's systemic forms, affects blood vessels and internal organs. As a result a condition called IPF or Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in which lung tissue becomes thickened, stiff, and scarred. Tricia was placed oxygen 24 hrs a day because her brain, heart, and other organs were not getting the oxygen they needed to function properly. In 2012 Tricia put off a life saving lung transplant to help her third grade students prepare  for a high stakes reading exam. Shortly after she headed off to Pittsburg to await her turn for a transplant. What We Need & What You'll Get
All proceeds collected will be used to help offset Tricia's medical and rehabilitation expenses. Every little bit helps and there is no minimum (or max) on what you can contribute.

<h2 class=""entry-title"">Managing Lights and Plugs Made Easy for Developers With Taapi’s API</h2>
<p>We believe that users should be able to control their light and wall sockets from their favorite applications and that app developers and game builders should be able to incorporate light and wall socket controls into their applications.<br/>Managing lights and plugs has typically been an expensive, proprietary domain using closed source systems. Producers of light and wallsocket controllers do not allow wide developer access to their products in the home or integration of their in-home products with third-party applications.</p>
<p><strong>How Taapi Works</strong><br/>We build wallsocket adapters and smart lightbulbs that operate using a commercial-grade protocol and low-energy WiFi chipset.<br/>Through our smart bulbs and wall socket adpaters we create secure communication between lights and wall sockets to power lights and sockets on and turn them off.<br/>The Taapi systems handle authentication of users devices, auth of user ID’s in your apps via OAuth and creating a completely masked identity for a user’s devices for security.<br/>Taapi also maintains a constant record of state that recalls the state a socket or light was in when it was acted upon by Taapi. Maintaining states ensures that the light or wall socket can be returned to it’s original state when a user wants to regain full control of their lights or wall sockets.</p>

<p class=""wp-caption-text"">Taapi employs commercial-grade standards in it’s open-source APIs.</p>
</div>
<p>Multiple devices can be run off of a Taapi wallsocket.  Lightbulbs can be used for hardwired lights, like overheads.</p>
<p>Taapi creates local WiFi communication between sockets and bulbs by using a hub that connects to your router. The hub communicates securely with the Taapi service and the light’s owner. The Taapi service exposes REST services to developers.</p>
<p><strong>Easy Integration for iOS, Android and OUYA Enabled Games</strong><br/>Integration with Taapi is optimized for speed and ease of set-up.<br/>Libraries for iOS, Android and a rapid-setup, special build set of classes for OUYA will be available to developers. Integration with Taapi is optimized for speed and ease of set-up.</p>
<p><strong>The Taapi Social Game</strong><br/>The Taapi API is now used to power a social game where unused lights are added to a pool of anonymous lights waiting to be turned off. Players race to turn off lights as they are added to the pool. This game leverages many parts of the API such as session establishment, auth and lights and plug management.<br/>The first Taapi game is available on iOS, Android and the OUYA game console.</p>

<h3><strong>What will the Taapi API offer developers?</strong></h3>
<p>Taapi manages the heavy lifting that devs typically associate with environmental controls: hardware, normalization, security, WiFi protocols and local network authentication<br/>We manage those pain points and provide the dev with a manageable API that they can leverage as the dev, and their users, see fit.<br/>Taapi has tools to provide access to a range of game and app developers by providing a full REST API with hooks that can programmatically act on Taapi’s services from your app or service.<br/>The Taapi API will provide access for app and game devs to features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding new players</li>
<li>Authenticating players</li>
<li>Calling player stats</li>
<li>Calling general country, energy, and date stats</li>
<li>Initiating a race session</li>
<li>Obtaining the stats for a unique race session</li>
<li>Polling for available races</li>
</ul><p>Taapi has selected Atlassian (<a href=""http://atlassian.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://atlassian.com</a>) products for community support, Mashery (<a href=""http://mashery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mashery.com</a>) for API hosting and Taapi has built-in an OpenSocial container for developers to write gadgets for Taapi using the OpenSocial (<a href=""http://opensocial.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://opensocial.org</a>) standard.</p>
<p>Taapi’s OpenSocial container support will allow developers to quickly and easily write OpenSocial compliant gadgets that can call and serve a number of Taapi features like public Taapi use statistics, aggregated stats, individual users stats and game session availability.</p>
<p>The Taapi OpenSocial container will support gadget authentication via OAuth to enable personalized, contextual player information and interaction as well.  Players will be able to add approved gadgets to their instances of the Taapi game and extend Taapi’s functionality.<br/>For example, a developer could write a ‘My Country’ Taapi gadget to alert a player when a session in a specific country is available, authenticate them, opt them into the game session and tweet about their participation, all in that country’s native language(s).</p>
<p>Taapi founder Carol Glennon states, “Support for an accelerated development process was one of our top goals for the Taapi platform. Enabling gadgets through our OpenSocial container makes it easy for developers to gain fast access to our API while writing cool gadgets that users can use in Taapi right away.”</p>
<p>Access to the Taapi API will also be available on Zapier, a service that syncs many different web apps. A developer can use Taapi and Zapier to initiate a number of web actions for example, setting a block of time that lights should be turned off for a user when they schedule a calendar event in the devs application.</p>

<p><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>Taapi is a collection of thousands of gamers around the world who race to turn off lights as they become available in the pool.  <strong><strong><br/></strong></strong><br/>So, how does it work?:<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>People plug Taapi into wallsockets and swap out the bulbs they would like to control with Taapi.</span></li>
<li><span>Light owners then use the mobile phone app to let Taapi systems know when their lights are available to the game for shut off.</span></li>
<li><span>When a home is tapped in, it’s lights are added to a ‘pool’ of other lights that are waiting to be turned off.</span></li>
<li>Meanwhile, players are racing to solve matching games and be the fastest to turn off lights from the pool as they become available.</li>
<li>Players get the satisfaction of knowing that they are turning off lights all over the world that are not being used. All with just a tap.</li>
<li>Every light and every location is completely secure. Lights in the pool are not identifiable in any way.  In fact, we do not collect any location-specific information from Taapi lights or wallsockets.</li>
<li>The Taapi hub packages the lights on its local network into an anonymous block of serial numbers before submitting them to the Taapi systems.</li>
</ul><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3XIMv64CStoU5vTsYUCqdcWq7Ig8m6ggvOmlOWvBmKcwNqeWUQIxorFZOG4bT1PyZpUE8Tf9t1J0fE4KcyeNmvVWBINVVLo4xeJfIWOF-hb0mTDGTN4-"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Taapi uses crowdsourced players to act on lights that are available in the pool for shut-off and rewards both players and the households that use taapi.<br class=""kix-line-break""/><br class=""kix-line-break""/>By being on Taapi, homes will benefit from saving money on their energy bills and also get points for every minute their lights are available to the game.<br/><br/>If some players want to keep their home’s lights all to themselves-that’s OK with us. They still get points (but not as many) and a nifty home control panel in the app. It’s full control for your home's lights right on your phone. </p>

<p>Carol Glennon is the founder of Synap Media, a mobile development group, and the brains behind Taapi. She has worked on mobile technology for over a dozen years for consumer-facing companies like Time Inc., The State of California, NatGeo and Coca-Cola. She lives, breathes and eats new concepts and ideas.<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong><br/>The idea behind Taapi is one that we’re sure is familiar to couples and families around the world: Carol leaves the lights on all the time, even when she is not home. Her husband, John, continuously shuts them off. While they thought that the lights on and lights off dance was “their thing,” they realized they weren’t alone when joking about it with friends and family.<br/><br/>The lights on, lights off battle that happens in homes between couples, parents, kids and roommates has been raging on for years, but with the proliferation of social gaming, the explosion of mobile connectivity and the ever-growing global carbon footprint - now is the time for Taapi.<strong><strong><br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BJ5a0yImUti0cYMlo9MsWVuUPsVZFQVQmMpWNH4Kf8xya0ZNnO-boQK9keFwZrxBbA80bhvAhPEEDdGqWVIgA0VR9pQ9iv2KKHKrSreAgISrTCjGa3o1"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></strong></strong></p>

<h1 dir=""ltr""><span>Will Taapi really make a difference?</span></h1>
<p>While eco-issues are a mainstay in the news and consumers are becoming more and more aware of their impact on the world, it’s still difficult to make an impact beyond recycling household items such as bottles, cans and paper goods. How can we, as a global community, make a difference beyond our own homes? That was the question that Carol asked herself. As an engineer, Carol looks at the world differently than most. When looking at the home lighting challenge, she turned the problem on its head asking,""What about tapping into the time consumers spend gaming on mobile devices or computers and use it to save electricity? Can we harness 'fun' and use it to serve a real purpose?"" Research indicates that about 11 percent of U.S. household electricity consumption goes into lighting and up to one-third of all lighting in the U.S. is wasted, according to ""<a href=""http://physics.fau.edu/observatory/lightpol-econ.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The International Dark-Sky Association</a>."" The annual cost? Roughly $2 billion. The oil required to produce the energy equates to 30 million barrels and 8.2 million tons of coal, which generates 14.1 million tons of CO2 per year into the atmosphere.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><strong><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ebGsPXeZh2I8d46EYwDosO6qQnqE769QVvASNv0zrMTNR1Ya5PVrrR5mrplwyblCWLZgsizxxfufZhWMiYviJSQ9FahF180xVKLIM_MmPKLSaOWJKRxx"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Q. Will this be limited to lights?<br/>A. Not necessarily. The starter pack includes bulbs and low-profile wall socket adapters, so you can choose to plug in whatever you want to have controlled through Taapi!<br/><br/>Q. How does it work?<br/>A. Each light is wifi connected to the base unit in a closed circuit. The base unit is controlled by the homeowner from their mobile phone and they decide when to make their lights available to the game. Once in the game, our platform gives each light an anonymous serial number and adds them to a pool of lights waiting to be turned off. Gamers then race to turn the lights off first either against opponents or on their own. Turning lights off earns points!<br/><br/>Q. What does the installation entail?<br/>A. It couldn’t be simpler – plug in the base station first and it will recognize the lights. You confirm them from your mobile phone or website access and then turn them on and off to confirm!<br/><br/>Q. What are your plans for international backers?<br/>A. We welcome them with open arms! Taapi is a global game, so we are very excited to bring on new countries – just bear in mind two things – the first is that there will be an additional charge for mailing you the starter pack and 2nd is that you will probably need an electrial adapter to fit your plug and voltage, such as you would for any other US electrical product. After initial launch, we will respond to demand for power supplies relating to other countries.</p>
<p>** Please add $20 to any reward which requires shipping of a product overseas! **<br/><br/>Q. What platforms will the application be available on?<br/>A. iOS (iPhone, iPod and iPad), Android and mainstream computer browsers<br/><br/>Q. Can I buy multiple packs?<br/>A. Of course! There is a “Baller” package for you to buy for friends and family. Plus as soon as we go over our Indiegogo fundraising, we will launch the eCommerce page where you can buy individual base stations, bulbs, socket adapters and packs to suit your needs.<br/><br/>Q. Can I buy more Taapi Bulbs and adapters?<br/>A. Definitely! As soon as we go over our Indiegogo fundraising target, we will launch the eCommerce page where you can buy individual base stations, bulbs, adapters and packs to suit your needs.<br/><br/>Q. How do I know my location and other personal data will be secure?<br/>A. We take privacy and security very seriously, so we have devised a system with several “safe zones” between critical data. <br/>Payment and fulfillment is made through Amazon, which means that we do not take your address directly for either payment processing or shipping. Amazon take care of that and do not pass that on to us at any stage.<br/>You do not register your address with us to set up Taapi - we assign a unique and non-identifying ID relating to each device, which allows us to see it go on grid and to ensure that control is specific to it.<br/>The platform that manages alerts from Taapi base stations that they are “on Taapi” is completely separate from the one that manages the game portion where users turn lights off. We anonymously batch the Taapi ID’s into groups and pass them from one system to the other, which means that the only data that the game platform sees is completely generic.<br/><br/>Q. Will the mobile application support multiple Taapi base units?<br/>A. Absolutely! You can manage up to four <br/><br/>Q. How many Bulbs can an individual base unit support?<br/>A. Literally hundreds – because of the way we connect to WiFi, we do not lose strength in volume and the system is engineered to manage as many as you can plug in<br/><br/>Q. What are the monthly fees?<br/>A. There are no monthly fees - once you buy the base package you need spend no more money again until you want more bulbs on Taapi!<br/><br/>Q. What is the range of the Base unit?<br/>A. Up to 300 feet, but each light extends the range, so technically, it can be a lot more tha that<br/><br/>Q. Will Taapi work with any game consoles?<br/>A. OUYA - I mean oh yeah! We are also onboarding several other game developers that operate games cross-console.<br/><br/>Q. Will you support Near-Field Communications (NFC)?<br/>A. Managing NFC on your phone to turn your home “On Taapi” or off will be fully supported based on your mobile phone functionality.<br/><br/>Q. What do you use for a wireless protocol?<br/>A. Our initial protocol support will be for the JenNet stack, a standard used globally for commercial light and appliance communication. It is safe, reliable, demonstrated in-field and great chip-makers like NXP are building for it regularly.

For Developers!
Managing Lights and Plugs Made Easy for Developers With Taapi’s API
We believe that users should be able to control their light and wall sockets from their favorite applications and that app developers and game builders should be able to incorporate light and wall socket controls into their applications.Managing lights and plugs has typically been an expensive, proprietary domain using closed source systems. Producers of light and wallsocket controllers do not allow wide developer access to their products in the home or integration of their in-home products with third-party applications.
How Taapi WorksWe build wallsocket adapters and smart lightbulbs that operate using a commercial-grade protocol and low-energy WiFi chipset.Through our smart bulbs and wall socket adpaters we create secure communication between lights and wall sockets to power lights and sockets on and turn them off.The Taapi systems handle authentication of users devices, auth of user ID’s in your apps via OAuth and creating a completely masked identity for a user’s devices for security.Taapi also maintains a constant record of state that recalls the state a socket or light was in when it was acted upon by Taapi. Maintaining states ensures that the light or wall socket can be returned to it’s original state when a user wants to regain full control of their lights or wall sockets.


Taapi employs commercial-grade standards in it’s open-source APIs.

Multiple devices can be run off of a Taapi wallsocket.  Lightbulbs can be used for hardwired lights, like overheads.
Taapi creates local WiFi communication between sockets and bulbs by using a hub that connects to your router. The hub communicates securely with the Taapi service and the light’s owner. The Taapi service exposes REST services to developers.
Easy Integration for iOS, Android and OUYA Enabled GamesIntegration with Taapi is optimized for speed and ease of set-up.Libraries for iOS, Android and a rapid-setup, special build set of classes for OUYA will be available to developers. Integration with Taapi is optimized for speed and ease of set-up.
The Taapi Social GameThe Taapi API is now used to power a social game where unused lights are added to a pool of anonymous lights waiting to be turned off. Players race to turn off lights as they are added to the pool. This game leverages many parts of the API such as session establishment, auth and lights and plug management.The first Taapi game is available on iOS, Android and the OUYA game console.


The Taapi Social Game

What will the Taapi API offer developers?
Taapi manages the heavy lifting that devs typically associate with environmental controls: hardware, normalization, security, WiFi protocols and local network authenticationWe manage those pain points and provide the dev with a manageable API that they can leverage as the dev, and their users, see fit.Taapi has tools to provide access to a range of game and app developers by providing a full REST API with hooks that can programmatically act on Taapi’s services from your app or service.The Taapi API will provide access for app and game devs to features such as:

Adding new players
Authenticating players
Calling player stats
Calling general country, energy, and date stats
Initiating a race session
Obtaining the stats for a unique race session
Polling for available races
Taapi has selected Atlassian (http://atlassian.com) products for community support, Mashery (http://mashery.com) for API hosting and Taapi has built-in an OpenSocial container for developers to write gadgets for Taapi using the OpenSocial (http://opensocial.org) standard.
Taapi’s OpenSocial container support will allow developers to quickly and easily write OpenSocial compliant gadgets that can call and serve a number of Taapi features like public Taapi use statistics, aggregated stats, individual users stats and game session availability.
The Taapi OpenSocial container will support gadget authentication via OAuth to enable personalized, contextual player information and interaction as well.  Players will be able to add approved gadgets to their instances of the Taapi game and extend Taapi’s functionality.For example, a developer could write a ‘My Country’ Taapi gadget to alert a player when a session in a specific country is available, authenticate them, opt them into the game session and tweet about their participation, all in that country’s native language(s).
Taapi founder Carol Glennon states, “Support for an accelerated development process was one of our top goals for the Taapi platform. Enabling gadgets through our OpenSocial container makes it easy for developers to gain fast access to our API while writing cool gadgets that users can use in Taapi right away.”
Access to the Taapi API will also be available on Zapier, a service that syncs many different web apps. A developer can use Taapi and Zapier to initiate a number of web actions for example, setting a block of time that lights should be turned off for a user when they schedule a calendar event in the devs application.


Taapi Partners and Community Services for Developers

In depth information?
Taapi creates local WiFi communication between sockets and bulbs by using a hub that connects to your router. The hub communicates securely with the Taapi service and the light’s owner.Taapi acknowledges when a light owner wants the game to manage their lights. Unused lights are added to a pool of anonymous lights waiting to be turned off. Players race to turn off lights as they are added to the pool. A light’s owner can also use Taapi as a private light management app and control only their lights, right from their mobile phone.
 
The idea?
Gamers around the globe race to turn real lights off and actually save energy while they play.
Taapi is a game that controls power outlets, it's also an API for game developers that want their players to be able to control opted-in outlets from their games.
Taapi is the IFTTT of the home energy management world. 
 

 
Why Taapi?
If you love games, leave the lights on all the time or love to turn lights off (hey, we won’t tell anyone you are obsessed!) then Taapi is for you.
ABOUT TAAPI
Taapi is a global social game that uses the power of players to save energy. Taapi makes turning lights off fun!Taapi is the first mobile gaming platform that will have a significant impact on the real-world.
We believe that gamers can change the world, one lightbulb at a time.
Gamers around the globe race to turn lights off and actually save real energy while they play. Available via iOS for iPhones, iPods and iPads, Android, OUYA and the web, Tappi awards players points for being the first to shut a waiting light off. Fun yes. Satisfying? Oh yeah.

Illuminate us!
Taapi is a collection of thousands of gamers around the world who race to turn off lights as they become available in the pool.  So, how does it work?:

People plug Taapi into wallsockets and swap out the bulbs they would like to control with Taapi.
Light owners then use the mobile phone app to let Taapi systems know when their lights are available to the game for shut off.
When a home is tapped in, it’s lights are added to a ‘pool’ of other lights that are waiting to be turned off.
Meanwhile, players are racing to solve matching games and be the fastest to turn off lights from the pool as they become available.
Players get the satisfaction of knowing that they are turning off lights all over the world that are not being used. All with just a tap.
Every light and every location is completely secure. Lights in the pool are not identifiable in any way.  In fact, we do not collect any location-specific information from Taapi lights or wallsockets.
The Taapi hub packages the lights on its local network into an anonymous block of serial numbers before submitting them to the Taapi systems.

Taapi uses crowdsourced players to act on lights that are available in the pool for shut-off and rewards both players and the households that use taapi.By being on Taapi, homes will benefit from saving money on their energy bills and also get points for every minute their lights are available to the game.If some players want to keep their home’s lights all to themselves-that’s OK with us. They still get points (but not as many) and a nifty home control panel in the app. It’s full control for your home's lights right on your phone. 
What Sparked the Idea?
Carol Glennon is the founder of Synap Media, a mobile development group, and the brains behind Taapi. She has worked on mobile technology for over a dozen years for consumer-facing companies like Time Inc., The State of California, NatGeo and Coca-Cola. She lives, breathes and eats new concepts and ideas.The idea behind Taapi is one that we’re sure is familiar to couples and families around the world: Carol leaves the lights on all the time, even when she is not home. Her husband, John, continuously shuts them off. While they thought that the lights on and lights off dance was “their thing,” they realized they weren’t alone when joking about it with friends and family.The lights on, lights off battle that happens in homes between couples, parents, kids and roommates has been raging on for years, but with the proliferation of social gaming, the explosion of mobile connectivity and the ever-growing global carbon footprint - now is the time for Taapi.
 
Will Taapi really make a difference?
While eco-issues are a mainstay in the news and consumers are becoming more and more aware of their impact on the world, it’s still difficult to make an impact beyond recycling household items such as bottles, cans and paper goods. How can we, as a global community, make a difference beyond our own homes? That was the question that Carol asked herself. As an engineer, Carol looks at the world differently than most. When looking at the home lighting challenge, she turned the problem on its head asking,""What about tapping into the time consumers spend gaming on mobile devices or computers and use it to save electricity? Can we harness 'fun' and use it to serve a real purpose?"" Research indicates that about 11 percent of U.S. household electricity consumption goes into lighting and up to one-third of all lighting in the U.S. is wasted, according to ""The International Dark-Sky Association."" The annual cost? Roughly $2 billion. The oil required to produce the energy equates to 30 million barrels and 8.2 million tons of coal, which generates 14.1 million tons of CO2 per year into the atmosphere.

<p> My name is Tony Radmilovich and I am 59 years old. My wife and I live on five beautiful acres that we have lavished love, attention and no small amount of elbow grease on over the past 12 years. My wife Kim is blind so responsibility for maintaining the house and property has rested primarily with me which is fine because I enjoy it. For the past 15 years I have been a designer and builder of custom furniture and a writer for the last ten.</p>
<p>Kim’s blindness has posed many challenges for us over our 20 years together that very few people ever face or even think about and we have always just dealt with it and lived our lives as best we could but events of the past nine months have left me virtually crippled and put our future in great jeopardy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Story:</p>
<p>This may sound far fetched and somewhat long-winded but unfortunately it is true although for the sake of brevity, many of the low points of the whole affair have been left out. It is nevertheless a long story simply due to the many events that have left me in constant high-level pain and unable to sit, stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time.</p>
<p>After months of physical therapy, ultrasound and epidural steroid injections, my neurologist recommended a fusion of my L5-S1 vertebrae which was performed in mid-November 2011. On the third day of my recuperation in the hospital, I was scheduled for an X-Ray to make sure that the hardware was holding properly and as I rolled out of bed to get into the wheelchair, the mattress began to slide with me and before I could do anything, it had slipped off the side of the bed, pitching me to the floor. Unfortunately, the horizontal base leg of my tray table was between me and the floor and I landed on it right on the incision site on my back. The Emergency Response Team eventually got me off the floor and into the wheelchair and the x-ray didn’t show any obvious damage to the hardware.</p>
<p>That evening I began feeling intermittent pain in my left sciatic nerve which I had never had before and the doctor attributed it to normal post-surgical irritation. A couple of days later I went home and began the long recovery from spinal fusion surgery, being very careful not to bend, lift or twist. After a couple of weeks the left sciatic pain worsened and eventually reached the point where I couldn’t bear any weight on that leg. My doc thought it might be a blood clot and sent me right to the hospital ER and I was admitted as an inpatient. An ultrasound and CT scan proved negative for the blood clot and my neurosurgeon diagnosed the problem as inflammation of my left nerve root. He put me on a regimen of oral steroids which gave me pretty much complete relief until shortly after completing the course when the pain returned. After a second course with the same result, he took a closer look at the CT scan and noticed that a piece of the hardware called an “interbody cage” was a couple of millimeters from where he had installed it in my spine and determined that it had been moving around hitting and/or impinging on my left leg/S1 nerve root. He strongly recommended removing it before any more damage could be caused and scheduled me for emergency surgery early the next morning.</p>
<p>After the surgery, it was found that my thecal sac had been cut and was leaking spinal fluid. The treatment for this was to lie completely flat in my hospital bed for 72 hours (which included Christmas day) while it patched itself. After release from this 5-day stay, I returned to the oral steroids as the pain persisted, eventually reaching the point where I had to be transported by ambulance to the hospital ER once again for pain control. A week or so after that, I noticed that my urine was a strange color and once again headed for the ER, thinking that it might be a recurrence of an earlier kidney infection. The ER nurse noticed some discharge from my surgical incision and a full blood workup was done. The results showed that I had contracted a severe Staph infection (during the previous surgery) and once again emergency surgery was scheduled. The surgeon found that my entire spinal area was badly infected and it had gotten into my bones and blood stream. He did his best to clean out my spine and hardware but he did not know how much damage it had caused. An infectious disease specialist ordered me on three months of IV antibiotics which required a “PIC line” be inserted through my arm and a portable IV pump that I would be hooked up to for that entire time. The antibiotics made me extremely sick for about a week and the leg pain got progressively worse after stopping the oral steroids.</p>
<p>Finally, the nerve pain in my leg became so extreme that I could not get myself out of bed and once again had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. Another MRI showed new signs of infection and movement of the remaining hardware. Yet another surgery revealed that the hardware had become completely involved by the infected and the resulting inflammation had pushed it loose and allowed it to hit my already inflamed nerve root whenever I moved. The hardware had to be removed, leaving me with a spine that isn’t really attached to anything at this point. I spent the next two weeks in the hospital having been left in a condition where my nerve root was severely damaged and I was unable to stand, walk or sit at all. Just moving the wrong way would send an extremely painful shock down my left leg that would last for up to a minute. Between being almost completely incapacitated by the nerve damage and very sick from the infection, I lost nearly 40lbs. For many months, extensive physical therapy, occupational therapy and acupuncture helped me improve to the point  could once again shower, dress and cook for myself and walk short distances with the aid of a crutch. I reached the point where I could drive and sit for longer periods but still relied on a crutch to be able to walk. Although I have made great strides in getting some strength back, I am still very weak and have to rely on narcotic pain relievers and other meds to keep the pain at anywhere near manageable levels. Without the meds I can’t even get out of bed. I am happy to say that I am finally clear of the Staph and that I was quite fortunate to have survived it. I wish no one would ever again contract this dangerous and debilitating bacterial infection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Impact:</p>
<p>Though much improved, I still cannot be on my feet for more than a short times nor can I sit normally meaning that I have to spend much of my time lying down. As a result, I am not able to work, maintain our house and property nor can I do any sort of recreation or hobby. It is especially difficult since my wife can’t drive or pick up my responsibilities. Pain is constant and often well in excess of level 5 (on the 1/10 scale). In the meantime, we need to pay people to do the repairs and maintenance that I would normally do and I need to be able to continue my ongoing therapy and treatment.</p>
<p>Even though I have good medical coverage through my wife, the out of pocket expenses for surgeries, hospital stays and ambulance rides is in excess of $30,000 and I need ongoing therapies that are not covered in hopes of walking on my own again. We live a very frugal lifestyle and don’t need much to make us happy (we haven’t taken a vacation in nearly 20 years and I can’t remember the last time we went out to eat) but because I have so many unpaid medical bills, my doctors won’t see me unless I can take care of them and with no income, it is impossible to keep up with them. My wife is highly educated and earns a fair salary but being blind, her opportunities are greatly limited and her income goes toward mortgage, utilities and food but with my continuing medical needs, it just doesn't go far enough. We don't spend money on anything beyond the bare necessities mentioned so there isn't anything we can cut back on to deal with all of this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the past year, my spine failed to fuse itself and the L5 vertebrae remained unattached to my sacrum causing a great deal of pain and instability. We are now past the one year mark and actually beginning to feel a little hope thanks to my most recent surgery (January 14) in which new hardware was installed to re-fuse my spine. While we are quite happy with the success of this surgery, it was a very major one requiring entry from the front and requiring an extensive recovery period for both my spine and abdominal organs that had to be temporarily ""taken out of the way"".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have seen some definite improvements from my recent surgery and we are actually hopeful for the first time in a long while but we still need to cover ongoing medical and living costs. We have been  greatly aided by the fundraising efforts of my friends and colleagues from <a href=""http://www.pcpilot.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PC Pilot Magazine</a> and the whole <a href=""http://forum.avsim.net/page/index.html/_/community/tony-radmilovich-fundraiser-flight-r1002"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">flight simulation community</a> but still fell short of our financial goal. Kim has had to file for personal bankruptcy which has erased some prior debt but much remains with new bills coming in all the time. This may sound a bit dramatic but it is fact; If we do not stay current on bills, the bankruptcy will be dismissed and our home foreclosed upon. We really do not airing our problems in such a public way nor asking for help but it is amazing what you will do when your back is against the wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so very much.</p>

The goal of my campaign is set at $3,000 so that I can offer stretch perks if my campaign meets the goal before the deadline!  There are many valuable perks that will be added if the campaign goal is met to help me fund the entire training!  If the campaign goal is not met, I will still use the funds raised towards the yoga teacher training.  The Perks:All of the massage sessions offered are at my office in Friday Harbor, WA (San Juan Island).  I normally schedule sessions Saturday through Monday, 12 noon till 5pm.  Please take my office hours into consideration before you choose one of these contributions.  Once you book your session, you will be asked to fill out a detailed health history form, and we will discuss your session goals and health history.  I may do some postural analysis or range of motion testing to help me plan the best possible session for you.   There is a 24-hour cancellation notice policy.  Once you make your contribution, contact me to schedule your session!  E-mail is the best way to contact me, but you can also call and leave a message.  All bodywork sessions are offered as contributions at generous discounts!  Any of these perks make fantastic gifts for the holidays, and you can request that I mail you a gift certificate in place of booking your own session.  Please provide the address you would like the gift certificate mailed to!  I will mail gift certificate and hot stone perks within a few days after you make your contribution, and I will send mail anywhere in the USA only.  I have perks that bundle 3 monthly sessions that are great if you want to work more in-depth over time to resolve a specific ailment or postural alignment (or if you just want that radiant glow that regular massage can provide!)  Shamanic Reiki energy medicine sessions may be done long-distance or in person at my office (same office hours as my massage sessions).  Sessions done in person are performed on a clothed client, with light touch or hands held just above the physical body.  Energy sessions are great for relaxation and to clear emotional/energetic blocks and patterns.  For more information on the energy medicine I provide, please visit our website!!E-mail: ckendra27@gmail.comPhone: 425-224-7250You can now book appointments on-line!  Please book after you make your contribution to claim your perk!  On-line booking links can be found on our website, Facebook page, or under the Indiegogo links!On-line Booking: http://www.LABYRINTHINEMASSAGE.ClickBook.net/For those of you who would like to contribute, but do not live in Friday Harbor, I offer energy sessions that can be done long-distance via phone/e-mail/skype.  Also, I have perk of your very own basalt hot stone with instructions on how to safely heat or cool the stone to use for therapeutic self-care!  New perk added!  There's only 1 available!  While in Peru/Bolivia, I will personally select a beautiful, authentic woven textile cloth to ship to you when I get back from the training (ship to USA only).  Visit the photo gallery to see an example of the cloth!Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions about any of my perks!! The ImpactYour contribution goes beyond helping me achieve my personal and professional goals.  I will take my training out into the world to serve people who may otherwise not have access to holistic care.  Every skill set I develop will also allow me to serve guests at the highest level possible once Labyrinthine's non-profit retreat center is established.  I believe in gift economy and alternative currency to provide healing to the world.  I am asking for resources (your gift or contribution) to help me realize my dreams of providing an outstanding level of holistic care to anyone who wants and needs it, regardless of their financial situation.  Thank you in advance for sharing in my vision of an abundant, joyous world for all!  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute, I understand!  There are other ways to help!  Please spread the word to all your friends and family!!  Use Indigogo's sharing tools!Visit and share our website and like us on facebook!!http://www.labyrinthineretreat.orgLabyrinthine Facebookhttp://www.LABYRINTHINEMASSAGE.ClickBook.net/",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Just like many Indians, every 4 years we found ourselves wondering why India can’t win more medals in the Olympics given the history, population and recent economic surge of our country. As always we end up complaining about politicians, infrastructure, bureaucracy and corruption only to forget about it till the next Olympics.</p>
<p>This time we wanted to make a difference; instead of fuming about reasons for failure, we decided to funnel the energy to address the one reason that we can control – Infrastructure.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that nurturing talented kids through their formative years is essential to succeed in the chosen field.  The key ingredients for this dream project is to identify someone who is not only dedicated and passionate about coaching kids, but has tasted success at the highest level.

<p>When inventing a better way for astronauts to measure their balance on missions, our founders experienced the loss of their grandmothers after fall related injuries. They realized their radical solution could help so many people across the planet. Until now, balance has been tricky to measure, and almost impossible to accurately assess on your own.</p>
<h3><strong>Our mission is to democratize balance: </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>To give everyone the right to know their balance in the comfort of their own home.</li>
<li>To help them understand how to improve it.</li>
<li>To get our SmartScales into every doctor's office so that balance testing is as routine as weight and blood pressure.</li>
<li>To reduce injury &amp; death from poor balance.</li>
</ul> <h3><strong>What is it?</strong></h3>
<p>The SmartScale looks like a bathroom scale (it also measures and tracks your weight). It uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to identify patterns of stability and instability as you simply stand still, with eyes open.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551994172/rmxqspggetb46nds0yjr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When the test is complete, the scale shows a score of 1-10. A score of 1-3 means poor balance and high risk of falling. Scores of 7 and above are in the ‘green zone.’ This means good balance.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554297735/xjo4mr2fmabmczvqmhua.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Balance is highly personal and fluctuates from one day to the next as many things affect it, which is where the Balance Coach app comes in. Think of it as your personal balance assistant: it tracks your balance score, fall history, weight, and guides you through your habits, grading them as helping, hindering or hurting so you can see which ones to keep and which ones need attention.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551979579/k4jtepveb01dnz6qwdci.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The app and scale contain the distilled knowledge and experience of our multi-generational and international team of engineers, scientists, and mathematicians. We have conducted over 15 years of research into balance, its measurement and improvement, working with some of the fittest and the most frail people.</p>
<p>Our latest clinical trials were conducted in partnership with UT Physicians, Memorial Hermann Hospital and two physical therapy clinics, which validated the Zibrio measure against the gold standard in clinical balance measurement and fall risk assessment.</p>
<p>The <strong>Zibrio Balance Coach app</strong> is available free for <a href=""https://apple.co/2TlQY51"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apple</a> &amp; <a href=""https://bit.ly/2TEhOos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Android</a> to help people begin to tune into the health factors that affect balance, and the SmartScales will be shipped August 2019.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The statistics are stark, across the entire population, the risk of serious injury from falling is about the same as for automobile accidents. 28% of those over 65 fall each year. Even now, in 2019, the best way to predict if someone will fall is if they've already fallen. Few people think about sports injury prevention until they're in rehab. So many accidents caused by poor balance.</p>
<p>We think that's unacceptable. There are so many ways to improve balance, at any stage. People shouldn't be kept in the dark about theirs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We chose the crowdfunding route because we're passionate about putting the user at the center of everything we do, and this gives us a great opportunity to hear directly from you to make sure you love the product we make for you.</p>
<p>Our experienced manufacturing partners have been fantastic with the technical parts of the design process, and they need a minimum commitment to progress to manufacturing. We need your help to raise $20,000 to purchase the parts we need at better volumes to assemble the first scales and get them to people as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Please help us. You can buy a scale for yourself, and there is a special bundle price so you can give something meaningful to those difficult-to-buy for friends and family. Bragging rights come with every scale! </p>
<p>If you'd rather help in another way, we have Zibrio branded bags to help us spread the good news about balance.</p>
<p>Know someone striving for a health goal? Everyone from runners to couch jockeys needs better balance. Help us to reach them by using the share tools at the top of the page.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While we are confident in our working prototypes and our research results, every engineering project can have delays and unforseen costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>There can be delays in getting some electronics parts - which is why we want to put our orders in as early as possible</li>
<li>The SmartScales are regulated by the FDA as class 1 exempt (lowest risk) and need to be registered with them. We have therefore chosen a manufacturer with experience in this area, and will be submitting our registration early April to give us time to resolve any additional steps before  the product is ready to ship.</li>

The app and scale contain the distilled knowledge and experience of our multi-generational and international team of engineers, scientists, and mathematicians. We have conducted over 15 years of research into balance, its measurement and improvement, working with some of the fittest and the most frail people.
Our latest clinical trials were conducted in partnership with UT Physicians, Memorial Hermann Hospital and two physical therapy clinics, which validated the Zibrio measure against the gold standard in clinical balance measurement and fall risk assessment.
The Zibrio Balance Coach app is available free for Apple & Android to help people begin to tune into the health factors that affect balance, and the SmartScales will be shipped August 2019.
Impact
The statistics are stark, across the entire population, the risk of serious injury from falling is about the same as for automobile accidents. 28% of those over 65 fall each year. Even now, in 2019, the best way to predict if someone will fall is if they've already fallen. Few people think about sports injury prevention until they're in rehab. So many accidents caused by poor balance.
We think that's unacceptable. There are so many ways to improve balance, at any stage. People shouldn't be kept in the dark about theirs.

What We Need & What You Get
We chose the crowdfunding route because we're passionate about putting the user at the center of everything we do, and this gives us a great opportunity to hear directly from you to make sure you love the product we make for you.
Our experienced manufacturing partners have been fantastic with the technical parts of the design process, and they need a minimum commitment to progress to manufacturing. We need your help to raise $20,000 to purchase the parts we need at better volumes to assemble the first scales and get them to people as quickly as possible.
Please help us. You can buy a scale for yourself, and there is a special bundle price so you can give something meaningful to those difficult-to-buy for friends and family. Bragging rights come with every scale! 
If you'd rather help in another way, we have Zibrio branded bags to help us spread the good news about balance.
Know someone striving for a health goal? Everyone from runners to couch jockeys needs better balance. Help us to reach them by using the share tools at the top of the page.

Risks & Challenges
While we are confident in our working prototypes and our research results, every engineering project can have delays and unforseen costs.

There can be delays in getting some electronics parts - which is why we want to put our orders in as early as possible
The SmartScales are regulated by the FDA as class 1 exempt (lowest risk) and need to be registered with them. We have therefore chosen a manufacturer with experience in this area, and will be submitting our registration early April to give us time to resolve any additional steps before  the product is ready to ship.

Nepal, which was probably one of the greatest 2 weeks of my life. The rich
culture, delicious cuisine and genuine people make it one of the best places on
Earth, I promise. Our trip was led by Amir Poudel, an adjunct Hopkins professor
who also received his Master’s degree from Hopkins. </p>
<p>As you may have heard, Nepal suffered a devastating
earthquake recently and is dire need of resources and manpower. Some of the heaviest
hit people are in the rural areas of Nepal, where they lack adequate drinking
water, food supplies, and medical care. If these people are not reached soon,
things may get desperate for them.</p>
<p>We must be prepared for when we reach these individuals and
this is where Amir comes in! Due to Amir’s familiarity with the regions around
Kathmandu, Amir has come up with a detailed way to get food and medical
supplies to these hard-hit areas. You can find his exact plan in the Gallery section! Amir wants
to reach 60 families, and he estimates each will cost around $40 on average.
That means we need to raise $2,400! Even if we don’t reach that goal, Amir will
still be able to provide numerous families with much needed supplies. </p>
<p>Amir does agricultural outreach programs with many of the
communities that were hardest hit. Because of this, he knows these families extremely
well and knows which areas are most accessible. If you read his plan, you will
see that he has already identified the nearest place to drop off supplies and
is only considering areas that are currently accessible.  </p>

</div></div>","Short SummaryRaylight is a leading italian games and plug-ins developer for Autodesk. We are the developer behind the much acclaimed and already released XrayUnwrap 1.6 for 3ds Max and Maya, XrayCat St for 3ds Max CAT, XrayBlendSkin and Rattle 1.0 for 3ds Max. These plug-ins have been very much appreciated by many famous companies which work both in the game and animation industries, but also by many freelance artists and animators. Our goal is to provide tools which speed up work pipelines at an affordable price for everyone.   This campaign is intended to make a 2.0 version with new and enhanced features of the renowned Unwrapping tool available. What We Need & What You GetWe need your support to improve Xrayunwrap and add new useful features. We selected flexible funding as we will have stretch goals so the more funds we get the more features we can add.             work in progress interface against old interface

THE GOALS 
If we reach 4000 euro:
- XrayUnwrap 2.0 for 3ds Max 2016 and Maya 2016;
- Redefined interface;

- Checker Textures + set tiling options: different types of checkers to verify the       unwrapping and tiling option management;
- Align/Sort islands to arrange islands horizontally or vertically;
-  UV simmetry: Reflects or flips either 1 side of a island to the other side or average booth sides so that they are in any case identical;
- Overlapping: overlaps in the same position of the map, islands with the same shape;
- Multi unwrap channels UDIM (UV offset system);




If we reach 6000 euro:
- Enhanced packing
islands: together with the classic bounding box arrangements, we will add an
enhanced packing algorithm to islands shape.

If we reach 9000 euro:
Xrayunwrap 2.0 for Maya on Linux;

If we reach 12000 euro:
Xrayunwrap 2.0 for Maya on Osx.





Feedbacks on previous Xrayunwrap version

Josleyn ""Strob"" Simard, Owner of StrobFX said I used Xrayunwrap to unwrap the UVs of all the suit parts for the IRON BABY. It was incredibly simple to use. I used to go outside of 3ds Max to use some UV unwrapping software to get the results I want but Xrayunwrap is perfectly integrated inside of 3ds Max.
No need to lose time importing and exporting geometry and debugging these steps! The result I get with Xrayunwrap is always perfect without any distortion and I get it almost automatically. For the IRON BABY,
I didn't lose a single minute.

Khaled Alkayed  ('Maybach Exelero' project), said UV mapping is the stage I hate the most but
the Xrayunwrap plug-in (from www.raylightgames.com) made it a lot
easier, so I recommend everyone to use it.

<p>Everything we do at UINCD centers around <b>integration</b>. People too often receive health care in a very <i>fragmented fashion</i>.

Though the reasons you have high blood pressure are probably the same reasons why you have diabetes, these connections aren't being addressed.<i> You aren't receiving integrated care. </i>In part, this is because the health system has become fragmented; it's also because your doctors and nurses are not getting trained to think about these diseases in an integrated way. </p>

</div></div>","UINCD: A brief history We're a group of passionate professionals in Uganda and the United States who have come together to tackle one of the most pressing health issues of our time: NCDs- or non-communicable diseases. Formed in 2013, the Uganda Initiative for Integrated Management of Non-Communicable Diseases (UINCD) brings together officials from the Uganda Ministry of Health, medical and public health faculty from Makerere University and Yale University, hospital managers, and groups representing patients. We are working to develop the best models of delivering care and training healthcare workers using an integrated approach to NCDs. 
Learn more about us and about NCDs on our website or in this recent New York Times story.



Why is integration important?
Everything we do at UINCD centers around integration. People too often receive health care in a very fragmented fashion. Instead of being taken care of holistically, you might go to a blood pressure clinic on Tuesday and a diabetes clinic on Thursday. Though the reasons you have high blood pressure are probably the same reasons why you have diabetes, these connections aren't being addressed. You aren't receiving integrated care. In part, this is because the health system has become fragmented; it's also because your doctors and nurses are not getting trained to think about these diseases in an integrated way. 




Our appeal to you: In order to continue our work while we await more substantial and long-lasting funding, we are looking to raise $20,000. Here's exactly where that money will go:


Support Ugandan students: At UINCD we're big on twinning. This means that every project has both American and Ugandan leadership. Your funds will support Ugandan medical or public health students to spend next summer working with us alongside American counterparts.


Training healthcare workers: We've already begun training doctors and nurses using our integrated approach toward NCDs. But there's much more to be done!

The first nationwide survey about healthcare workers' knowledge and attitude regarding NCDs in Uganda: This will give us the information we need to create even better integrated NCD training curricula for healthcare providers.

Program Manager salary support: We couldn't do what we do without our amazing Program Manager!

The Perks
Everybody likes to get a little something special for doing some good! Our perks all make terrific holiday season gifts for friends, family, and co-workers! 
The perks have been donated by the following wonderful Kampala-based businesses! Please support them when you have the chance!

Human Corrective Kinetics will be the most significant change in the Fitness industry since its creation. A scientific methodology that will expose the present day ineffectiveness of a 100 billion dollar a year Fitness industry and a philosophy that will change the public perception of the term Health and Fitness. </h3><h3>
<br/> </h3><h3><span>  Human Corrective Kinetics was developed by Kinesiologist Christian DiSapio. Christian is the owner of an industry leading company called FitnesScience LLC <a href=""http://www.LongIslandFitnessEducator.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.LongIslandFitnessEducator.com</a> and holds two separate fitness degrees including one in Kinesiology. Kinesiology is a new and advanced field of study that is classified as a Health Science and is defined as the study of human movement. Before starting his own company Christian worked as a fitness leader for over 5 years at Canyon Ranch. Canyon Ranch is one of the top health, fitness and wellness facilities in the country with world wide recognition. Christian has studied the Science of fitness and exercise for almost 20 years and has been committed to offering his clients the most premier fitness education available today. Over the past few years Christian and FitnesScience LLC have spent thousands of hours developing a program that can be distributed to the masses. The result is a revolutionary industry changing product that will be a guide for every human to understand how to maintain or increase their functionality and performance across their entire lifespan, while helping to drastically reduce the potential for muscular and skeletal injuries, pain and soreness. </span></h3><h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">
<br/><br/> </h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192644/files/20131112084620-064.jpg?1384274780"" src="""" style=""width: 435.33px; height: 327px;""/></h3><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: justify;""><span>  How does Human Corrective Kinetics work?  Corrective Kinetics is based on the fact that the human body can physically function more effectively when it is in proper spinal/postural alignment and muscle balance, and that training to bring the body as close as possible to optimal alignment and balance will only increase the potential of the body to physically perform better in everything it does regardless of age. By analyzing common human repetitious movements and repeated body positions, it becomes apparent that they are the major cause of muscle imbalances and or spinal misalignments. This program defines a new medical condition known as “RMARPS” or Repetitious Movement and Repeated Positioning Syndrome. Most everyone will show signs of RMARPS to some degree, but are unaware of its existence and its negative effects. Human Corrective Kinetics<br/>was developed to specifically counteract or reverse the negative effects of RMARPS and the negative effects of all fitness, sport and exercise routines. </span></h3><h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">
<br/> </h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192665/files/20131112085722-iStock_000006847593Small.jpg?1384275442"" src="""" style=""width: 265.77px; height: 520px;""/></h3><h3>
<span>  How is Human Corrective Kinetics different from traditional exercise?</span> Unlike a lot of traditional fitness training and exercise that is usually based on how the body looks, Human Corrective Kinetics is based on how the body feels and functions. Corrective Kinetics was developed<br/>utilizing collective scientific theories and the physiology involved in all movement and all postural positioning. The basis of Corrective Kinetics centers on the importance of the spine and postural alignment. It looks at the position and function of the internal structural system first (spinal column and bones) and then how the external muscles can be addressed to improve the position and function of that internal structure. It is very different than traditional exercise that usually makes training the external surface muscles the focus, with little or no regard as to how that affects the internal structural system. Since the internal structural system cannot easily be seen or analyzed it is very hard for the average person to notice the significant effects that regular exercise and daily movements can have on that internal structural system. Human Corrective Kinetics philosophy is designed to work for varying purposes, for the entire population regardless of age or physical condition. Almost all traditional exercise is done with the intention of achieving relatively short term results and focusing on what the positive effects will be in the short term and are not appropriate for the long term needs of the population. Human Corrective Kinetics analyzes the long term effects and negative consequences of movement and exercise. It is also the first fitness methodology to address the negative effects of common repetitious movements and repeated body positions and how these important variables should be affecting how everyone exercises, moves and positions themselves throughout 24 hours a day, whether they are exercising or not. The cumulative negative effects of daily<br/>movement, positioning, and exercise are happening to everyone but most people are not aware of it because the effects are happening slowly over time, and not as a result of a specific movement/exercise that they did or a specific trauma that they had. As a result the soreness, pain, and injuries that happen as a result of these cumulative effects are often misdiagnosed by healthcare professionals that are typically more concerned with treatment than cause. Another difference between Human Corrective Kinetics and traditional exercise is that Corrective Kinetics primary focus is how well someone can feel and function, and not necessarily how much weight someone can lose or how well someone’s body can look. However, when using Corrective Kinetics techniques to improve muscle balance, spinal alignment and functionality, an improved visual look to someone’s body is also achieved. Traditional exercise is also highly influenced by popular trends and the way the current fitness industry operates. Because of the large profits that can be made, a lot of fitness programs and products are developed for their marketability and not necessarily for their effectiveness. There is a constant need for the fitness industry to develop seemingly “new and advanced” forms of exercise and equipment that are supposed to be less time consuming and more effective than the old stuff. Unfortunately it is not working, and the fitness industry continues to grow and profit while the health of the country continues to decline. Human Corrective Kinetics was designed to not only be used as a stand alone methodology, but also as practical information that can be applied to any other type of fitness, exercise or athletic program to help improve their short and/ or long term effectiveness. There are some similarities between the exercises and movements that Human Corrective Kinetics uses and those used in traditional exercises. Because the human body only moves in so many different directions it is inevitable that some exercises or movements that are used with Corrective Kinetics will be movements and exercises that are sometimes done or associated with traditional exercise routines as well. However, the frequency and duration of time spent strengthening or stretching certain muscles as compared to other muscles will be very different, and overall a complete exercise routine that is based on the fundamentals of Human Corrective Kinetics would look very different than a traditional exercise routine would.<span> </span>
</h3><h3><span> </span></h3><h3 style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192785/files/20131112094052-iStock_000002043786Small.jpg?1384278052"" src="""" style=""width: 372px; height: 248px;""/></p><h3><span>  What can Human Corrective Kinetics do?  Corrective Kinetics is a methodology that can literally bridge the gap to bring the Health and Fitness industries together. It represents a program that was developed utilizing the latest collective Health Science information available. It is worthy of the regulation and standards set forth by the Health industry, yet represents a preventive health and fitness guideline that everyone can follow before, as well as during and after negative health symptoms or conditions present themselves. It can be used as a tool to predict future areas of decreased functional capacity, pain and soreness and injury susceptibility. Human Corrective Kinetics techniques are beneficial for everyone from children to professional athletes to the elderly and injured because its primary objective is increased health, fitness and functionality across anyone’s entire lifespan. It is a revolutionary program that focuses on both short term and long term health. It is the first health and fitness program to account for the movements and positions that all humans routinely perform throughout every minute of everyday, and as a result provides a blueprint for how everyone can address the negative impact that these variables will have. It can represent the start of a change from fitness that is used for vanity to fitness that is used for functionality. Because the program offers ideal long term and preventive solutions to neck and back pain and osteoarthritis without the use of chiropractic adjustments, pain medications, local injections or surgeries and these two epidemics together account for nearly 200 billion ( that’s billion! ) dollars a year in healthcare costs, we truly feel that we can lower healthcare premiums for everyone. Human Corrective Kinetics can be considered the new standard for the term “Fitness” where as the current fitness industry should largely be considered part of a separate “Beauty” industry. Corrective Kinetics can represent an outline of the most basic necessary components for anyone’s health, fitness or exercise routine as well as a system of foundational information that can be added or integrated into anyone’s existing routine. Additionally, Human Corrective Kinetics principals can also be utilized by the large percentage of the population that does not regularly exercise. Because of its practicality and large scope of practice, it is also something that will translate into many other areas of life. The hope is that not only can this important information be exposed to millions of people now, but that the philosophy of Human Corrective Kinetics will become the foundation of a new standardized Fitness industry that can work in conjunction with the Health industry in the future, to truly give everyone a chance to feel and function as well as possible, regardless of age or physical condition.</span></h3><h4>

However, while the information contained in the program is not ""Rocket Science"" it is Science and since the program is based on the analyzation of all human movement and body positioning, we feel that the use of video and computer animation is necessary as a teaching tool to help everyone fully understand the content. While the DVD series will contain traditional exercise instruction it will be much more than an exercise routine. It will be an educational tool for anyone to be able to understand how all movement, body positioning and exercise will effect their functionality, performance and injury susceptibility across different parts of their lifespan. It will break down traditional strengthening, stretching, aerobic and athletic exercises to expose their potential disadvantages and future consequences. It will present  fitness guidelines that can be used either by itself or as practical information that can be applied to any other type of health, fitness, wellness, athletic or exercise routine. Besides being distributed publicly, we also plan to have it distributed by healthcare professionals. We feel that we have created a preventive scientific health and fitness program that is finally worthy of the standards required of Healthcare professionals. As a result Healthcare professionals will feel confident recomending Human Corrective Kinetics as a type of ""defensive driving course"" only for health and fitness. </h3><h3> </h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/193856/files/20131112185047-imagesCA2A3LSM.jpg?1384311047"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><h3> </h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/193857/files/20131112185105-imagesCA1ZGH2W.jpg?1384311065"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><h3>The video will be produced by Simba Productions.

Human Corrective Kinetics will be the most significant change in the Fitness industry since its creation. A scientific methodology that will expose the present day ineffectiveness of a 100 billion dollar a year Fitness industry and a philosophy that will change the public perception of the term Health and Fitness. 
   Human Corrective Kinetics was developed by Kinesiologist Christian DiSapio. Christian is the owner of an industry leading company called FitnesScience LLC www.LongIslandFitnessEducator.com and holds two separate fitness degrees including one in Kinesiology. Kinesiology is a new and advanced field of study that is classified as a Health Science and is defined as the study of human movement. Before starting his own company Christian worked as a fitness leader for over 5 years at Canyon Ranch. Canyon Ranch is one of the top health, fitness and wellness facilities in the country with world wide recognition. Christian has studied the Science of fitness and exercise for almost 20 years and has been committed to offering his clients the most premier fitness education available today. Over the past few years Christian and FitnesScience LLC have spent thousands of hours developing a program that can be distributed to the masses. The result is a revolutionary industry changing product that will be a guide for every human to understand how to maintain or increase their functionality and performance across their entire lifespan, while helping to drastically reduce the potential for muscular and skeletal injuries, pain and soreness. 
     How does Human Corrective Kinetics work?  Corrective Kinetics is based on the fact that the human body can physically function more effectively when it is in proper spinal/postural alignment and muscle balance, and that training to bring the body as close as possible to optimal alignment and balance will only increase the potential of the body to physically perform better in everything it does regardless of age. By analyzing common human repetitious movements and repeated body positions, it becomes apparent that they are the major cause of muscle imbalances and or spinal misalignments. This program defines a new medical condition known as “RMARPS” or Repetitious Movement and Repeated Positioning Syndrome. Most everyone will show signs of RMARPS to some degree, but are unaware of its existence and its negative effects. Human Corrective Kineticswas developed to specifically counteract or reverse the negative effects of RMARPS and the negative effects of all fitness, sport and exercise routines. 
 
  How is Human Corrective Kinetics different from traditional exercise? Unlike a lot of traditional fitness training and exercise that is usually based on how the body looks, Human Corrective Kinetics is based on how the body feels and functions. Corrective Kinetics was developedutilizing collective scientific theories and the physiology involved in all movement and all postural positioning. The basis of Corrective Kinetics centers on the importance of the spine and postural alignment. It looks at the position and function of the internal structural system first (spinal column and bones) and then how the external muscles can be addressed to improve the position and function of that internal structure. It is very different than traditional exercise that usually makes training the external surface muscles the focus, with little or no regard as to how that affects the internal structural system. Since the internal structural system cannot easily be seen or analyzed it is very hard for the average person to notice the significant effects that regular exercise and daily movements can have on that internal structural system. Human Corrective Kinetics philosophy is designed to work for varying purposes, for the entire population regardless of age or physical condition. Almost all traditional exercise is done with the intention of achieving relatively short term results and focusing on what the positive effects will be in the short term and are not appropriate for the long term needs of the population. Human Corrective Kinetics analyzes the long term effects and negative consequences of movement and exercise. It is also the first fitness methodology to address the negative effects of common repetitious movements and repeated body positions and how these important variables should be affecting how everyone exercises, moves and positions themselves throughout 24 hours a day, whether they are exercising or not. The cumulative negative effects of dailymovement, positioning, and exercise are happening to everyone but most people are not aware of it because the effects are happening slowly over time, and not as a result of a specific movement/exercise that they did or a specific trauma that they had. As a result the soreness, pain, and injuries that happen as a result of these cumulative effects are often misdiagnosed by healthcare professionals that are typically more concerned with treatment than cause. Another difference between Human Corrective Kinetics and traditional exercise is that Corrective Kinetics primary focus is how well someone can feel and function, and not necessarily how much weight someone can lose or how well someone’s body can look. However, when using Corrective Kinetics techniques to improve muscle balance, spinal alignment and functionality, an improved visual look to someone’s body is also achieved. Traditional exercise is also highly influenced by popular trends and the way the current fitness industry operates. Because of the large profits that can be made, a lot of fitness programs and products are developed for their marketability and not necessarily for their effectiveness. There is a constant need for the fitness industry to develop seemingly “new and advanced” forms of exercise and equipment that are supposed to be less time consuming and more effective than the old stuff. Unfortunately it is not working, and the fitness industry continues to grow and profit while the health of the country continues to decline. Human Corrective Kinetics was designed to not only be used as a stand alone methodology, but also as practical information that can be applied to any other type of fitness, exercise or athletic program to help improve their short and/ or long term effectiveness. There are some similarities between the exercises and movements that Human Corrective Kinetics uses and those used in traditional exercises. Because the human body only moves in so many different directions it is inevitable that some exercises or movements that are used with Corrective Kinetics will be movements and exercises that are sometimes done or associated with traditional exercise routines as well. However, the frequency and duration of time spent strengthening or stretching certain muscles as compared to other muscles will be very different, and overall a complete exercise routine that is based on the fundamentals of Human Corrective Kinetics would look very different than a traditional exercise routine would. 
    What can Human Corrective Kinetics do?  Corrective Kinetics is a methodology that can literally bridge the gap to bring the Health and Fitness industries together. It represents a program that was developed utilizing the latest collective Health Science information available. It is worthy of the regulation and standards set forth by the Health industry, yet represents a preventive health and fitness guideline that everyone can follow before, as well as during and after negative health symptoms or conditions present themselves. It can be used as a tool to predict future areas of decreased functional capacity, pain and soreness and injury susceptibility. Human Corrective Kinetics techniques are beneficial for everyone from children to professional athletes to the elderly and injured because its primary objective is increased health, fitness and functionality across anyone’s entire lifespan. It is a revolutionary program that focuses on both short term and long term health. It is the first health and fitness program to account for the movements and positions that all humans routinely perform throughout every minute of everyday, and as a result provides a blueprint for how everyone can address the negative impact that these variables will have. It can represent the start of a change from fitness that is used for vanity to fitness that is used for functionality. Because the program offers ideal long term and preventive solutions to neck and back pain and osteoarthritis without the use of chiropractic adjustments, pain medications, local injections or surgeries and these two epidemics together account for nearly 200 billion ( that’s billion! ) dollars a year in healthcare costs, we truly feel that we can lower healthcare premiums for everyone. Human Corrective Kinetics can be considered the new standard for the term “Fitness” where as the current fitness industry should largely be considered part of a separate “Beauty” industry. Corrective Kinetics can represent an outline of the most basic necessary components for anyone’s health, fitness or exercise routine as well as a system of foundational information that can be added or integrated into anyone’s existing routine. Additionally, Human Corrective Kinetics principals can also be utilized by the large percentage of the population that does not regularly exercise. Because of its practicality and large scope of practice, it is also something that will translate into many other areas of life. The hope is that not only can this important information be exposed to millions of people now, but that the philosophy of Human Corrective Kinetics will become the foundation of a new standardized Fitness industry that can work in conjunction with the Health industry in the future, to truly give everyone a chance to feel and function as well as possible, regardless of age or physical condition.
      What do we need?We need your help to raise enough money to produce an educational DVD series. The Human Corrective Kinetics program and the information that will be in the DVD series is complete. Thousands of hours have been spent on putting the content together. What we essentially have is a book that contains about 175 pages of written text and over 500 photos and illustrations. We could have decided to publish and sell the book. However, while the information contained in the program is not ""Rocket Science"" it is Science and since the program is based on the analyzation of all human movement and body positioning, we feel that the use of video and computer animation is necessary as a teaching tool to help everyone fully understand the content. While the DVD series will contain traditional exercise instruction it will be much more than an exercise routine. It will be an educational tool for anyone to be able to understand how all movement, body positioning and exercise will effect their functionality, performance and injury susceptibility across different parts of their lifespan. It will break down traditional strengthening, stretching, aerobic and athletic exercises to expose their potential disadvantages and future consequences. It will present  fitness guidelines that can be used either by itself or as practical information that can be applied to any other type of health, fitness, wellness, athletic or exercise routine. Besides being distributed publicly, we also plan to have it distributed by healthcare professionals. We feel that we have created a preventive scientific health and fitness program that is finally worthy of the standards required of Healthcare professionals. As a result Healthcare professionals will feel confident recomending Human Corrective Kinetics as a type of ""defensive driving course"" only for health and fitness.   The video will be produced by Simba Productions. They are a Manhattan based production company with over 20 years of experience and have worked with some of the largest companies in the world as well as some of the top talent in the industry. The estimated cost of our full production DVD series is about $100k. All money raised will go towards this video production. Any additional money raised will go either towards potentially adding more elaborate video and production content, or to promotional, advertising, or distribution costs. If our campain goal is not met additional investors will be used to make up the difference. THIS VIDEO WILL BE MADE!! We have invested too much time and effort to not make this production a reality. We have already copyrighted both the written material and pictures as well as an audio recording of all its content to ensure that no one can attempt to steal our product. After the DVD is complete it will be copyrighted too. The information contained in this program is too valuable to the entire population for it to not be shared, and we are commited to changing a failing industry and improving the life long health and fitness of everyone.    
We are offering some amazing perks to our contributors. Besides offering discounted and free Human Corrective Kinetics DVDs and the opportunity to get stuff before the public can, we feel that we have some really great one of a kind offers.

of life"". Nowhere is this truer than in an environment where knowledge and
education can mean the difference between life and death. 
Education and healthcare should not be reserved for the
developed world but should be the right and expectation of all people. That is
what we are working to achieve here at LFHC. As our library grows, it opens the
world of medicine up for our staff who are hungry to learn, and help their
country and their community. Every day, hundreds of children come to our
hospital, and with access to books, journals and other educational materials,
our staff can better ensure that they go home happy and healthy. 
Nothing worth doing is easy to do
Books are not readily available in Laos and high-quality medical material
even less so. This is the main challenge we face in our library. However, with
volunteers arriving regularly from around the globe we can source many
essential items internationally and have them brought over.

<p>Yoga4Autism aims to help people with Autism using healthy natural methods such as yoga, mindfulness, meditation, exercise, nutrition, being with nature &amp; healthy living. We address the causes rather than covering up the symptoms as has been the way in the past with brain numbing drugs and other techniques which many are now becoming aware simply do not work.  Our techniques are completely <strong>100% natural</strong> and are in fact not only good for them, they are good for anyone who wishes to live a healthy and balanced life style.</p>

<h2><strong>Who we are</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, I am David Ellams, I have a condition known to most as both Aspergers and also Dyspraxia. I was diagnosed with Dyspraxia when I was 3 years old when my parents noticed I had problems with speech including stuttering.</p>
<p>I have always had problems fitting in anywhere and being accepted, and has led to a very challenging childhood that has continued through to adulthood.I was bullied excessively in childhood due to not being able to defend myself or having no boundaries and being too trusting.</p>
<p>I have also always struggled with expressing myself clearly and I am constantly mis-understood which leads to a lot of frustration.All of this has led to many issues I have to content with including Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Anger and Depression.All of which I am happy to say are a thing of the past due to my own special coping strategies I have developed over the years.</p>
<p>I am now highly successful and rated as one of top IT contractors and software developers in the country. Nokia themselves even stated I am the best contractor they have ever seen and hired me without even meeting me (I am the only one they have ever hired without a face to face interview).</p>
<p>One of the gifts many possess on the Autistic Spectrum is excelling at technical, scientific and mathematical subjects, we find complex things easy and normal everyday things hard. I have learnt how to harness my gifts and at the same time find many successful coping strategies for the everyday living skills we normally find a challenge.</p>
<p>I now wish to share these with others going through similar difficulties so they do not have to suffer and struggle like I once did, and in doing so hope to help them lead a successful, happy and fulfilling life as I now live.</p>
<p>I have also teamed up with expert yoga teachers and my business partner and good friend Rupert Kingsman who is very skilled and experienced with working with people with Aspergers and others on the Autistic Spectrum as well as studying brain function and psychology at University.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yoga4Autism or Y4A is the Future Portal for people on the Autistic Spectrum. We provide yoga and meditation for Autism and Aspergers and we also act as a research centre for the progression of energy medicine and Mindfulness Meditation techniques. With our impressive array of research professionals and EEG technicians and yoga/meditation teachers we offer organisations like Mindvalley support for their app and product development.</p>
<p>Scientific research coming out of non-for profit organisations in the USA, show that individuals on the Autistic Spectrum benefit greatly from yoga and meditation. Y4A uses a combination of science and eastern spiritual understanding, based on over one thousand years of practice.</p>
<p>Our mission is to educate the world about the strong connection between science and spirituality, through helping the world remember the work of forgotten scientific geniuses Nikola Tesla and Royal Raymond Rife and their connection with influential and respected Yogis and teachers of Vedic Science. Our long term mission is to help people realise that all matter is frequency and fluctuating vacuum and that all disease, disorder and discomfort has a particular resonating frequency, that can be brought back into balance with ‘normal’ frequencies using suppressed technologies and understanding of particle physics.</p>
<p>We also hope to help people realise that although frequency can lead to what society classes as ‘ disorder’, Autism can be seen as a frequency gift for the waiting world – something we can both learn from and work in harmony with.</p>
<p>Y4A will work closely with sister projects like NextGen which creates futuristic social apps and online gaming, with a benevolent, spiritual emphasis, and employs people from all walks of life including super creative and talented people with ASD (Autism, Aspergers, etc) who we have helped turn their lifes around with Y4A. We hope to encourage all employees of NextGen to practice yoga and meditation daily as part of their daily work schedule, thus reinforcing creativity and optimum performance.</p>
<p>NextGen also now offer a FREE training course for EVERYONE from all walks of life including  unemployed, homeless, single mums, kids on the streets, etc. They do not need any previous experience or qualifications so it is open to  EVERYONE! We want to help people find their strengths and their own individual dormant gifts, and then help them hone them so they can share them with the world. We actively encourage their creative and imagination and empower them to come up with their own original ideas as well as improving on existing ones. We will even give them the opportunity to work on their own projects. We want to help all those people who the world has turned their back on and those people who no longer believe in themselves, we want to show them that we believe in them and in time they will believe in themselves again.</p>
<p>Our training course is so much more than just a course, it is also vital and valuable life coaching that includes meditation, mindfulness, yoga, exercise, nutrition and how to live a healthy, happy and fulfilling lifestyle. During the course and when they work WITH us after rather than for, we actively encourage regular breaks and spiritual practice such as meditation, yoga, etc.</p>
<p>They also have peace of mind that the apps, websites &amp; games they will be helping to develop will be aimed at helping everyone out there by teaching meditation, mindfulness, etc in a fun way for the whole family. We want to build online communities that encourage supporting and helping each other including strangers. It is all about bringing everyone together and realising we are all part of the same source so we should start working together and supporting each other.</p>
<p>We hope to get this everywhere including into Schools, Colleges, etc as well as Job Centres and back to work schemes. We also hope to work with Charities such as The Salvation Army since they are now offering a course called Awaken to give people they help the skills they need to get back into work, we feel with our course they will never need to worry about work or money again.</p>
<p>Our training course helps everyone all round since it also helps communities by making them safer and helps reduce crime, it will also reduce unemployment and the skilled labour deficit as well as helping the economy recover. This is only scratching the surface of how we can help everyone.</p>
<p>I hope by now you can see the real value in what we are offering?</p>
<p>We need help getting out there, getting noticed and in getting the training course everywhere. We also need help securing funding for this as well as our other projects such as Yoga4Autism, we feel we do qualify for every type of funding out there, but since we are only a new start-up we need help finding and securing this funding due to us having very limited resource at this time.</p>
<p>Myself and my business partner Rupert still need to work full-time to cover our living costs, which leaves very little time to put into these projects, so we are now at a critical phase where we desperately need help getting everything moving, we hope you may be able to help us with that? Or at least point us in the right direction?</p>
<p>We have TONS of ideas for apps but need the resource to develop them, which is one of the reasons why the training programme was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What we do</strong></h2>
<h3>Sensory Yoga,  Mediation, Mindfulness &amp; Story Telling</h3>
<p>Rupert realised that he might help Asperger’s individuals and those labelled with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, cope with the many stressors and stimuli that make life challenging, through helping individuals easily access techniques such as yoga, meditation and mindfulness.</p>
<p>The primary aim of Y4A is to achieve Mindfulness in Autistic adults and children, the essence of yoga, through artistic, storytelling education, that easily guides individuals into Pranayama, Mudras and Asanas.</p>
<p>This physical and spiritual education will be very sensory, relying on BICS – breathing techniques, imagination, colour and sound, to cool down the individual’s nervous system and hopefully create for them a coping strategy and mechanism to fall back on and use in everyday life, away from the Y4A Sensory Studio. We will hopefully have a main yoga leader in charge of the class, with less experienced yoga teachers being amongst the adult or youth group, for more individual support when needed.</p>
<p>We will make this extra fun with storytelling and role playing helping to encourage their imagination and creativity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social awareness, education and integration.</h3>
<p>Our small group workshops also help with social awareness, education and integration.  For children, their teachers and parents will notice a significant improvement in behaviors, concentration and performance in school. Their child will be noticeable more happy and at ease with them self and the world around them.</p>
<p>Likewise, adults will also notice these improvements, which will continue to grow the more they participate with the workshop sessions and follow the <strong>FREE</strong> guides we will give them (more detail below).</p>
<p>We hope to get this into as many Schools as possible and our aim is to get this as part of the national curriculum, we plan to expand to help <strong>ALL</strong> children in future and not only Autistic ones…</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>FREE</strong> Daily Coping Strategy Guide</h3>
<p>We will also give them an easy to follow daily coping strategy guide, which details many of the coping strategies I have developed over the years as well as insight and input from other professionals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Smartphone Apps</h3>
<p>We hope to also develop apps that they can carry with them everywhere and will be there to offer assistance when they need it most.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>FREE</strong> Insiders Guide To Autism</h3>
<p>We will also provide inside information on how Autistic people think and feel and what makes them act or behave the way they do, who better to write and share this than someone who has lived with Aspergers their whole life and so understands it better than many so called “experts” do.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>100% Natural and Good for everyone’s health</h3>
<p>Our aim is to help and cure the cause, not cover up the symptoms with numbing drugs and other techniques which many are now becoming aware simply do not work.  Our techniques are completely <strong>100% natural</strong> and are in fact not only good for them, they are good for anyone who wishes to live a healthy and balanced life style.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What we need</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>Since we intend to register as a charity very shortly, we really need funding by whatever means possible to get this project off the ground and make it a reality.</p>
<p>We plan to also help children and adults with other learning difficulties and disabilities. We have many more ideas and projects on how we can help all children and communities not only through yoga but also through educational fun games through the use of technology and other means.</p>
<p>We will also be doing some ground-breaking scientific R&amp;D by actually measuring the participants emotions and brain function to analyse the most effective technique on both a collective and individual basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Spread the word</h3>
<p>We also need to spread the word so please help us get out there and known so we can help as many people as possible live happy and fulfilling life’s… thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Partnership/Collaboration</h3>
<p>We hope we can also work with other Autistic Groups &amp; Organisations in partnership or collaboration in future due to our intentions and objectives being aligned, in that we want to help as many people as possible who are on the Autistic Spectrum so they can live happier and more fulfilling life’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Experienced Yoga Teachers</h3>
<p>Finally, we are always on the lookout for experienced yoga teachers who would be able to help our cause. Below is the message we would appreciate you could forward and circulate to any yoga teachers who may be interested:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We would provide specialist training to work with people with ASD. ASD is becoming more and more common today where it is now as common as one in four people, and this is set to only increase.</em></p>
<p><em>Once you have trained with us, you will be one of the very few yoga teachers in the world who is qualified to help people with ASD, so you will be very highly sought after. You would also have the opportunity to start your own Y4A franchise, enabling us to help as many people with ASD as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>In future we hope to expand to help more and more people with other disabilities and learning difficulties. This will also expand to cover children too.</em></p>
<p><em>So please do not miss out on an opportunity of a lifetime to not only become a more specialist yoga instructor, but also to really help make a difference out here by giving someone a life they really deserve to live, which without your help wouldn’t have been possible.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Be the change you wish to see in the world…</strong>“</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Where the funding goes</strong></h2>
<p><span>All monies raised will go towards hireling halls to host Y4A sessions, seminars, essential equipment for instructors and clients, staff, merchandise and research into various aids and side projects (which we believe will give us an advantage over others who practice in this area).</span></p>
<p><span>We also hope to rent our own permanent Yoga Studio so please help us achieve our dream to help as many people with Autism as possible through natural healthy ways, which are good for everybody...</span></p>

<p>To help as many people as possible on the Autistic Spectrum to live happy fulfilling life’s to their full potential. We wish to find healthy natural ways of doing this without the use of any prescription medication. Once we have helped people to fulfill their potential we wish to also offer them all jobs in partnership with our sister company NextGen Software Ltd.</p>
<p>NextGen Software Ltd provides <strong>FREE</strong> training for <strong>EVERYONE</strong> and do not require any previous skills or experience. The course teaches them how to make fun apps &amp; games for the whole family which are also educational and teach vital skills such as meditation, mindfulness, yoga, nutrition, exercise and healthy living. We want to really empower people to believe in themselves again and to know they can achieve everything they dream off without any limitations. We want to actively encourage their creativity and imagination and give them free reign to work on or create whatever they like.</p>
<p>They also of course make excellent money and have extra peace of mind knowing their work is going towards helping people and making the world a better place.</p>
<p>The course as well as working with (we prefer with rather than for) us also have the same meditation, mindfulness, yoga, nutrition, exercise and healthy living built into the course and daily work pattern.</p>
<p>We know that people on the Autistic Spectrum will be equally as gifted and super creative as one of our founders David Ellams. We want to find their gifts and strengths and help hone and develop them further…</p>

The Universe and the angels really were with us at the show, everyone was attracted to the love &amp; light like moths to the flame! </span><br/><br/><span>I knew it was mission accomplished</span><span class=""text_exposed_show""> when people starting saying we have heard of you and we were recommended to come and see you... <br/><br/>I have been invited to do inspirational talks and may even be featured in magazines and on television soon...<br/><br/>We also have schools interested in both the yoga and also the NextGen Software Training programmes, I will be going into Schools to do talks and mentoring soon... <br/><br/>I couldn't have done it without my helpers so a BIG shout out, respect and thanks to Stephen Watts (Technician), Denny Burfield (Yoga Instructor), Aariya Rae (Yoga Instructor), Aurelia Aquila (Nutrition Specialist/Masseuse) and Rob Smith (Autism Practitioner/Specialist). <br/><br/>So I am really glad that exhausting myself physically, emotionally and financially (cost 2k in total!) all paid off!

<p> </p>
<p><b>UPDATE (02/10/13):</b></p>
<p>Greetings All,<br/><br/>Hope this message finds you well?<br/><br/>A BIG heart felt appeal...<br/><br/>Two months ago I collapsed with Adrenal Fatigue due to burning myself out working 14+ hours a day contracting in London to try and fund Y4A and then was working into the early hours on Y4A as well as weekends... I had no social life whatsoever since my heart was set on Y4A and wanted to see my dream come alive to help as many people on the spectrum as possible to live happy fulfilling lifes to their fullest potential without any limitation...<br/><br/>I have been out of work for nearly 2 months due to Adrenal Fatigue so Y4A has stalled. Two of the other core team have also been out of action due to the passing of their mum recently.<br/><br/>The final member has a full-time job and a family with 2 kids to look after too so has very little free time to spend on Y4A.<br/><br/>We had a stand booked for the Om Yoga show from the 24th - 27th October. This costs about a grand and I was going to be fronting this cash when I was still contracting but obviously I can no longer do this.<br/><br/>I have already put in about 3k into funding Y4A, mostly from the Autism Shows in London and Manchester.<br/><br/>We need a min of 10 yoga teachers before we can train them so we can then start the workshops which have been in high demand. I have had a lot of interest from Schools, etc.<br/><br/>We have about 5 yoga teachers currently signed up. The Om Yoga Show was going to be how we got the rest we needed.<br/>We even have an advert in the latest edition of their magazine which I had previously paid for (see photos below)<br/><br/>It looks really smart, but we really do need to get to this show....<br/><br/>So what I am asking for is:<br/><br/>1. Could at least one person please go to the show to represent Y4A (more would be preferable of course! :) ) I will even pay them if required once I am back into work or we finally receive some funding. I have applied for a Business Loan for NextGen Software projects as well as Y4A. So fingers crossed with that...<br/><br/>2. If we do not get the loan then can anyone help raise the money needed for the show? Again, I can repay this if necessary.<br/><br/>3. Staff needed for Y4A to help run it....<br/><br/>4. Funding for Y4A, we are eligible for all sorts of funding, but we just need someone to go and get it...<br/><br/><br/>We also need the Business Plan finishing so we can register as a charity...<br/><br/>I would do it but at the moment I am doing all I can to survive and keep my head above water so I need to focus on what is guaranteed to make me money but I am even struggling with that since I only get a couple of hours a day tops between rests and trying to keep myself alive since I live on my own and some days just cooking is hard let alone cleaning, my place is quite a state at the moment.<br/><br/>I am also applying for personal loans too, anything I can do to buy myself sometime to try and make a full recovery...<br/>I am trying to stay positive and optimistic and really do not want to see my dream of Y4A go down the pan.<br/><br/>Sharon, the person who was going to be doing the training over here is now nearly fully booked for next year, she was suppose to be coming over in Dec or Jan. But we need those 10 teachers first...<br/><br/>After the show everyone wants to do yoga for their ASD pupile/patients, etc but since we can not yet provide they are going elsewhere, which is why I think Sharon is getting booked up...<br/><br/>So if we are to keep Y4A going we need to act NOW. No more time to waste, this is it, make or break time...<br/><br/>I was hoping if we all worked together we can somehow keep this dream alive?<br/><br/>Please help me keep the dream alive... :)<br/><br/>Would be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Many thanks,<br/>David Ellams BSc(Hons)<br/>Mangaging Director &amp; Founder<br/>Y4A.<br/><br/><a href=""http://yoga4autism.org/shows/om-yoga-show-staff-funding-needed-to-help-save-y4a/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://yoga4autism.org/shows/om-yoga-show-staff-funding-needed-to-help-save-y4a/</a><br/></p>

Yoga4Autism aims to help people with Autism using healthy natural methods such as yoga, mindfulness, meditation, exercise, nutrition, being with nature & healthy living. We address the causes rather than covering up the symptoms as has been the way in the past with brain numbing drugs and other techniques which many are now becoming aware simply do not work.  Our techniques are completely 100% natural and are in fact not only good for them, they are good for anyone who wishes to live a healthy and balanced life style.

Who we are
Hi, I am David Ellams, I have a condition known to most as both Aspergers and also Dyspraxia. I was diagnosed with Dyspraxia when I was 3 years old when my parents noticed I had problems with speech including stuttering.
I have always had problems fitting in anywhere and being accepted, and has led to a very challenging childhood that has continued through to adulthood.I was bullied excessively in childhood due to not being able to defend myself or having no boundaries and being too trusting.
I have also always struggled with expressing myself clearly and I am constantly mis-understood which leads to a lot of frustration.All of this has led to many issues I have to content with including Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Anger and Depression.All of which I am happy to say are a thing of the past due to my own special coping strategies I have developed over the years.
I am now highly successful and rated as one of top IT contractors and software developers in the country. Nokia themselves even stated I am the best contractor they have ever seen and hired me without even meeting me (I am the only one they have ever hired without a face to face interview).
One of the gifts many possess on the Autistic Spectrum is excelling at technical, scientific and mathematical subjects, we find complex things easy and normal everyday things hard. I have learnt how to harness my gifts and at the same time find many successful coping strategies for the everyday living skills we normally find a challenge.
I now wish to share these with others going through similar difficulties so they do not have to suffer and struggle like I once did, and in doing so hope to help them lead a successful, happy and fulfilling life as I now live.
I have also teamed up with expert yoga teachers and my business partner and good friend Rupert Kingsman who is very skilled and experienced with working with people with Aspergers and others on the Autistic Spectrum as well as studying brain function and psychology at University.
 
Yoga4Autism or Y4A is the Future Portal for people on the Autistic Spectrum. We provide yoga and meditation for Autism and Aspergers and we also act as a research centre for the progression of energy medicine and Mindfulness Meditation techniques. With our impressive array of research professionals and EEG technicians and yoga/meditation teachers we offer organisations like Mindvalley support for their app and product development.
Scientific research coming out of non-for profit organisations in the USA, show that individuals on the Autistic Spectrum benefit greatly from yoga and meditation. Y4A uses a combination of science and eastern spiritual understanding, based on over one thousand years of practice.
Our mission is to educate the world about the strong connection between science and spirituality, through helping the world remember the work of forgotten scientific geniuses Nikola Tesla and Royal Raymond Rife and their connection with influential and respected Yogis and teachers of Vedic Science. Our long term mission is to help people realise that all matter is frequency and fluctuating vacuum and that all disease, disorder and discomfort has a particular resonating frequency, that can be brought back into balance with ‘normal’ frequencies using suppressed technologies and understanding of particle physics.
We also hope to help people realise that although frequency can lead to what society classes as ‘ disorder’, Autism can be seen as a frequency gift for the waiting world – something we can both learn from and work in harmony with.
Y4A will work closely with sister projects like NextGen which creates futuristic social apps and online gaming, with a benevolent, spiritual emphasis, and employs people from all walks of life including super creative and talented people with ASD (Autism, Aspergers, etc) who we have helped turn their lifes around with Y4A. We hope to encourage all employees of NextGen to practice yoga and meditation daily as part of their daily work schedule, thus reinforcing creativity and optimum performance.
NextGen also now offer a FREE training course for EVERYONE from all walks of life including  unemployed, homeless, single mums, kids on the streets, etc. They do not need any previous experience or qualifications so it is open to  EVERYONE! We want to help people find their strengths and their own individual dormant gifts, and then help them hone them so they can share them with the world. We actively encourage their creative and imagination and empower them to come up with their own original ideas as well as improving on existing ones. We will even give them the opportunity to work on their own projects. We want to help all those people who the world has turned their back on and those people who no longer believe in themselves, we want to show them that we believe in them and in time they will believe in themselves again.
Our training course is so much more than just a course, it is also vital and valuable life coaching that includes meditation, mindfulness, yoga, exercise, nutrition and how to live a healthy, happy and fulfilling lifestyle. During the course and when they work WITH us after rather than for, we actively encourage regular breaks and spiritual practice such as meditation, yoga, etc.
They also have peace of mind that the apps, websites & games they will be helping to develop will be aimed at helping everyone out there by teaching meditation, mindfulness, etc in a fun way for the whole family. We want to build online communities that encourage supporting and helping each other including strangers. It is all about bringing everyone together and realising we are all part of the same source so we should start working together and supporting each other.
We hope to get this everywhere including into Schools, Colleges, etc as well as Job Centres and back to work schemes. We also hope to work with Charities such as The Salvation Army since they are now offering a course called Awaken to give people they help the skills they need to get back into work, we feel with our course they will never need to worry about work or money again.
Our training course helps everyone all round since it also helps communities by making them safer and helps reduce crime, it will also reduce unemployment and the skilled labour deficit as well as helping the economy recover. This is only scratching the surface of how we can help everyone.
I hope by now you can see the real value in what we are offering?
We need help getting out there, getting noticed and in getting the training course everywhere. We also need help securing funding for this as well as our other projects such as Yoga4Autism, we feel we do qualify for every type of funding out there, but since we are only a new start-up we need help finding and securing this funding due to us having very limited resource at this time.
Myself and my business partner Rupert still need to work full-time to cover our living costs, which leaves very little time to put into these projects, so we are now at a critical phase where we desperately need help getting everything moving, we hope you may be able to help us with that? Or at least point us in the right direction?
We have TONS of ideas for apps but need the resource to develop them, which is one of the reasons why the training programme was born.
 
What we do
Sensory Yoga,  Mediation, Mindfulness & Story Telling
Rupert realised that he might help Asperger’s individuals and those labelled with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, cope with the many stressors and stimuli that make life challenging, through helping individuals easily access techniques such as yoga, meditation and mindfulness.
The primary aim of Y4A is to achieve Mindfulness in Autistic adults and children, the essence of yoga, through artistic, storytelling education, that easily guides individuals into Pranayama, Mudras and Asanas.
This physical and spiritual education will be very sensory, relying on BICS – breathing techniques, imagination, colour and sound, to cool down the individual’s nervous system and hopefully create for them a coping strategy and mechanism to fall back on and use in everyday life, away from the Y4A Sensory Studio. We will hopefully have a main yoga leader in charge of the class, with less experienced yoga teachers being amongst the adult or youth group, for more individual support when needed.
We will make this extra fun with storytelling and role playing helping to encourage their imagination and creativity.
 
Social awareness, education and integration.
Our small group workshops also help with social awareness, education and integration.  For children, their teachers and parents will notice a significant improvement in behaviors, concentration and performance in school. Their child will be noticeable more happy and at ease with them self and the world around them.
Likewise, adults will also notice these improvements, which will continue to grow the more they participate with the workshop sessions and follow the FREE guides we will give them (more detail below).
We hope to get this into as many Schools as possible and our aim is to get this as part of the national curriculum, we plan to expand to help ALL children in future and not only Autistic ones…
 

FREE Daily Coping Strategy Guide
We will also give them an easy to follow daily coping strategy guide, which details many of the coping strategies I have developed over the years as well as insight and input from other professionals.
 
Smartphone Apps
We hope to also develop apps that they can carry with them everywhere and will be there to offer assistance when they need it most.
 

FREE Insiders Guide To Autism
We will also provide inside information on how Autistic people think and feel and what makes them act or behave the way they do, who better to write and share this than someone who has lived with Aspergers their whole life and so understands it better than many so called “experts” do.
 
100% Natural and Good for everyone’s health
Our aim is to help and cure the cause, not cover up the symptoms with numbing drugs and other techniques which many are now becoming aware simply do not work.  Our techniques are completely 100% natural and are in fact not only good for them, they are good for anyone who wishes to live a healthy and balanced life style.
 
 
What we need
 
Funding
Since we intend to register as a charity very shortly, we really need funding by whatever means possible to get this project off the ground and make it a reality.
We plan to also help children and adults with other learning difficulties and disabilities. We have many more ideas and projects on how we can help all children and communities not only through yoga but also through educational fun games through the use of technology and other means.
We will also be doing some ground-breaking scientific R&D by actually measuring the participants emotions and brain function to analyse the most effective technique on both a collective and individual basis.
 
Spread the word
We also need to spread the word so please help us get out there and known so we can help as many people as possible live happy and fulfilling life’s… thank you.
 
Partnership/Collaboration
We hope we can also work with other Autistic Groups & Organisations in partnership or collaboration in future due to our intentions and objectives being aligned, in that we want to help as many people as possible who are on the Autistic Spectrum so they can live happier and more fulfilling life’s.
 
Experienced Yoga Teachers
Finally, we are always on the lookout for experienced yoga teachers who would be able to help our cause. Below is the message we would appreciate you could forward and circulate to any yoga teachers who may be interested:
 

“We would provide specialist training to work with people with ASD. ASD is becoming more and more common today where it is now as common as one in four people, and this is set to only increase.
Once you have trained with us, you will be one of the very few yoga teachers in the world who is qualified to help people with ASD, so you will be very highly sought after. You would also have the opportunity to start your own Y4A franchise, enabling us to help as many people with ASD as possible.
In future we hope to expand to help more and more people with other disabilities and learning difficulties. This will also expand to cover children too.
So please do not miss out on an opportunity of a lifetime to not only become a more specialist yoga instructor, but also to really help make a difference out here by giving someone a life they really deserve to live, which without your help wouldn’t have been possible.
Be the change you wish to see in the world…“

 
Where the funding goes
All monies raised will go towards hireling halls to host Y4A sessions, seminars, essential equipment for instructors and clients, staff, merchandise and research into various aids and side projects (which we believe will give us an advantage over others who practice in this area).
We also hope to rent our own permanent Yoga Studio so please help us achieve our dream to help as many people with Autism as possible through natural healthy ways, which are good for everybody...
 


Our Mission









To help as many people as possible on the Autistic Spectrum to live happy fulfilling life’s to their full potential. We wish to find healthy natural ways of doing this without the use of any prescription medication. Once we have helped people to fulfill their potential we wish to also offer them all jobs in partnership with our sister company NextGen Software Ltd.
NextGen Software Ltd provides FREE training for EVERYONE and do not require any previous skills or experience. The course teaches them how to make fun apps & games for the whole family which are also educational and teach vital skills such as meditation, mindfulness, yoga, nutrition, exercise and healthy living. We want to really empower people to believe in themselves again and to know they can achieve everything they dream off without any limitations. We want to actively encourage their creativity and imagination and give them free reign to work on or create whatever they like.
They also of course make excellent money and have extra peace of mind knowing their work is going towards helping people and making the world a better place.
The course as well as working with (we prefer with rather than for) us also have the same meditation, mindfulness, yoga, nutrition, exercise and healthy living built into the course and daily work pattern.
We know that people on the Autistic Spectrum will be equally as gifted and super creative as one of our founders David Ellams. We want to find their gifts and strengths and help hone and develop them further…

And also check out and like our page here:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nextgen-Software-Ltd/496583567054216
We also hope to work with health care practitioners, parents, teachers & carers to bring more effective treatment for Autism.
We wish to make live’s better one by one and to do our part in making the world a better place…

UPDATE:
 
I am pleased to announce that the Autism Show was an awesome success! Even with the last minute rush and a few minor bumps we are now on the radar and we are known! Literally on both days, within seconds of arriving we were swarmed! The Universe and the angels really were with us at the show, everyone was attracted to the love & light like moths to the flame! I knew it was mission accomplished when people starting saying we have heard of you and we were recommended to come and see you... I have been invited to do inspirational talks and may even be featured in magazines and on television soon...We also have schools interested in both the yoga and also the NextGen Software Training programmes, I will be going into Schools to do talks and mentoring soon... I couldn't have done it without my helpers so a BIG shout out, respect and thanks to Stephen Watts (Technician), Denny Burfield (Yoga Instructor), Aariya Rae (Yoga Instructor), Aurelia Aquila (Nutrition Specialist/Masseuse) and Rob Smith (Autism Practitioner/Specialist). So I am really glad that exhausting myself physically, emotionally and financially (cost 2k in total!) all paid off! The sweat, blood and tears was worth it! Nailed it! Look out world, here we come! We still need help with funding so anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated especially now I cant afford to live or pay my rent after using the last of my savings to make this happen:http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/yoga4autismAlso we still need more LIKES on our FB Page:https://www.facebook.com/Yoga4AutismAnd spreading the word far and wide about us:http://yoga4autism.com/
 
UPDATE (02/10/13):
Greetings All,Hope this message finds you well?A BIG heart felt appeal...Two months ago I collapsed with Adrenal Fatigue due to burning myself out working 14+ hours a day contracting in London to try and fund Y4A and then was working into the early hours on Y4A as well as weekends... I had no social life whatsoever since my heart was set on Y4A and wanted to see my dream come alive to help as many people on the spectrum as possible to live happy fulfilling lifes to their fullest potential without any limitation...I have been out of work for nearly 2 months due to Adrenal Fatigue so Y4A has stalled. Two of the other core team have also been out of action due to the passing of their mum recently.The final member has a full-time job and a family with 2 kids to look after too so has very little free time to spend on Y4A.We had a stand booked for the Om Yoga show from the 24th - 27th October. This costs about a grand and I was going to be fronting this cash when I was still contracting but obviously I can no longer do this.I have already put in about 3k into funding Y4A, mostly from the Autism Shows in London and Manchester.We need a min of 10 yoga teachers before we can train them so we can then start the workshops which have been in high demand. I have had a lot of interest from Schools, etc.We have about 5 yoga teachers currently signed up. The Om Yoga Show was going to be how we got the rest we needed.We even have an advert in the latest edition of their magazine which I had previously paid for (see photos below)It looks really smart, but we really do need to get to this show....So what I am asking for is:1. Could at least one person please go to the show to represent Y4A (more would be preferable of course! :) ) I will even pay them if required once I am back into work or we finally receive some funding. I have applied for a Business Loan for NextGen Software projects as well as Y4A. So fingers crossed with that...2. If we do not get the loan then can anyone help raise the money needed for the show? Again, I can repay this if necessary.3. Staff needed for Y4A to help run it....4. Funding for Y4A, we are eligible for all sorts of funding, but we just need someone to go and get it...We also need the Business Plan finishing so we can register as a charity...I would do it but at the moment I am doing all I can to survive and keep my head above water so I need to focus on what is guaranteed to make me money but I am even struggling with that since I only get a couple of hours a day tops between rests and trying to keep myself alive since I live on my own and some days just cooking is hard let alone cleaning, my place is quite a state at the moment.I am also applying for personal loans too, anything I can do to buy myself sometime to try and make a full recovery...I am trying to stay positive and optimistic and really do not want to see my dream of Y4A go down the pan.Sharon, the person who was going to be doing the training over here is now nearly fully booked for next year, she was suppose to be coming over in Dec or Jan. But we need those 10 teachers first...After the show everyone wants to do yoga for their ASD pupile/patients, etc but since we can not yet provide they are going elsewhere, which is why I think Sharon is getting booked up...So if we are to keep Y4A going we need to act NOW. No more time to waste, this is it, make or break time...I was hoping if we all worked together we can somehow keep this dream alive?Please help me keep the dream alive... :)Would be greatly appreciated.Many thanks,David Ellams BSc(Hons)Mangaging Director & FounderY4A.http://yoga4autism.org/shows/om-yoga-show-staff-funding-needed-to-help-save-y4a/

<p><strong>Nuts &amp; Bolts</strong></p>
<p>On June 2, 2013 I began hiking the Finger Lakes Trail in upstate New York. My fundraising goal for this first hike is to raise some money for the places that made this possible to one extent or another. Your contribution will impact <strong><a href=""https://www.cornellurology.com/physicians-faculty/find-a-provider/richard-lee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Weill Cornell Medical College Department of Urology</a></strong> (funding Dr. Richard Lee's research as well as a scholarship fund for interns--saw many of these while in hospital), University of Vienna, Austria (<strong><a href=""http://weillcornell.org/physician/sshariat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Shahrokh Shariat</a></strong> organized an amazing surgical team who worked on me for nearly 10 hours last summer, giving me and my kidneys a chance at a longer life span), and finally an outstanding local hospital: <a href=""http://www.crouse.org/services/neonatal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Crouse Hospital</strong></a> (the area’s certified Regional Perinatal Center offering care for regional spina bifida births).</p>

<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>That warm, fuzzy feeling that comes from knowing you’ve done good. In addition, Thad felt strongly about giving something to those who want it. Please help yourself to one of the perks! It's mostly for those near to New York but everyone needs a vacation now and then, right?</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Thad has been through hell and back. Those of you who know us personally can attest to this (if you don't know us, visit <a href=""http://www.kimo342.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Face it</a>). A life of spina bifida myelomeningocele is not easy. Most people born with this, especially in the late 60s, are not ambulatory or not alive at all. The surgery he had last summer marked the fourth major surgery of his life. Did you know? Even though Thad can walk, he’s really only walking on one leg. Check out the photo. His right leg is visibly shorter and smaller than the left. He has an underdeveloped calf muscle, claw foot, and is a couple inches shorter on this side. He’s already noted some pain for pushing this leg and the hike has just begun. So, why? He is passionate about the subtitle of his <a href=""http://www.kimo342.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">page</a>: “moving forward with diligence” (a quote from Buddhism) and bringing awareness to <strong>bladder cancer</strong> (often recipients of urostomy surgeries—in his case, his bladder never developed at all), <strong>spina bifida</strong>, and <strong>urostomy</strong> in general. He’s changing his bag in the wild! Inspirational? While this is a word he eschews due to modesty, we live it every day.</p>
<p>Please help us meet this minimum goal. No amount is too small. Times are tough. We get it. We struggle too. But these causes are worth the sacrifice of 560 miles and over 30 days without seeing your wife and kids (well, okay, we'll see him a few times on the trail, but you get the idea). Any contribution is greatly appreciated! Amounts not connected to one of the three causes will be divided equally between the three.</p>

<p>This November I have a very special opportunity to volunteer as a photographer to help StoveTeam International document the work that they are doing in Honduras to bring clean cookstoves to families in need.</p>
<p><strong>During this trip, I will interview and photograph stove users and discover how their lives have been changed by the stove. I will also photograph the inside of homes to document the damage done by open fire cooking, both to a home and the women who cook.</strong></p>
<p>All of this will enable StoveTeam, which is a small non-profit with one paid staff person, to use my photos, audio recordings, and videos to generate support for their programs and better inform people in the United States about the important work they are doing.</p>
<h2>About StoveTeam International</h2>
<p>StoveTeam promotes a safe, highly efficient cookstove called the Ecocina by helping entrepreneurs in developing countries establish sustainable, locally owned and operated stove factories to make and sell Ecocina stoves. T<strong>hese stoves have dramatically changed the lives of over 150,000 people in a positive way. The burns and respiratory illnesses women and children too often suffer are eliminated by the stove, as it emits no smoke and reduces the emissions of harmful carbon and particulate matter by more than 70%.</strong> Since 2007, StoveTeam has helped entrepreneurs establish six factories in five countries, resulting in the distribution of over 27,000 stoves.</p>
<p>I hope you will join me in supporting this important project. Your support will allow me to help StoveTeam International tell the very needed stories of how a stove can help to reverse and prevent the serious environmental and health problems caused by open fire cooking.</p>
<p>This stove project changes lives and you can help. If you would like to learn more about StoveTeam, you can visit their website at <a href=""http://www.stoveteam.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stoveteam.org</a>.</p>
<h2>My Budget</h2>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""My Budget"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.caitlinchildsphoto.com/costs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

This November I have a very special opportunity to volunteer as a photographer to help StoveTeam International document the work that they are doing in Honduras to bring clean cookstoves to families in need.
During this trip, I will interview and photograph stove users and discover how their lives have been changed by the stove. I will also photograph the inside of homes to document the damage done by open fire cooking, both to a home and the women who cook.
All of this will enable StoveTeam, which is a small non-profit with one paid staff person, to use my photos, audio recordings, and videos to generate support for their programs and better inform people in the United States about the important work they are doing.
About StoveTeam International
StoveTeam promotes a safe, highly efficient cookstove called the Ecocina by helping entrepreneurs in developing countries establish sustainable, locally owned and operated stove factories to make and sell Ecocina stoves. These stoves have dramatically changed the lives of over 150,000 people in a positive way. The burns and respiratory illnesses women and children too often suffer are eliminated by the stove, as it emits no smoke and reduces the emissions of harmful carbon and particulate matter by more than 70%. Since 2007, StoveTeam has helped entrepreneurs establish six factories in five countries, resulting in the distribution of over 27,000 stoves.
I hope you will join me in supporting this important project. Your support will allow me to help StoveTeam International tell the very needed stories of how a stove can help to reverse and prevent the serious environmental and health problems caused by open fire cooking.
This stove project changes lives and you can help. If you would like to learn more about StoveTeam, you can visit their website at www.stoveteam.org.

<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">            </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Lourdes is the heart and soul of ‘The Garden of Light’. Born in Bilbao, loving simplicity and nature, she has been living in the countryside of Ibiza for more than 30 years. For the past 18 years, Lourdes, with the love and support of many wonderful beings, has created an oasis of transformation, 'The Garden of Light'.  Her passion to improve human conditions and to discover the mysteries of life, brought her to experiment and connect with a wide variety of different teachings, techniques, philosophies, masters, etc... We are proud to be continuing and growing the wonderful work that Lourdes has started and having her as part of our family.      </p>

<h2><strong>DREAM….VISION….FUNDING....REALITY!!!!</strong></h2>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The following is an overview of our vision and of our development plan.</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The current accommodations are situated higher up the mountain side than the main Center and the dinning area. We must first create a path joining all the tiers together, creating a natural flow between the Center, the Healing Garden Spa, Red Road Lodge Healing and Treatment area, the Gardens, Casa Chakra and Balinese inspired accommodation.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""Casa Chakra"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/19388_190675597742414_1691534065_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We intend to build this pathway as organically as possible to enhance the beauty and functionality of the nature all around us, using stones and materials from the land wherever possible, as well as recyclable and recycled materials. Providing areas for relaxation, meditation, swimming or seating to just to rest and chill for a moment whilst overlooking beautiful mountain-views.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt=""Casa Curazon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/73365_190680524408588_1613598426_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 210px;"">The Casa Chakra is our only accommodation, which allows for a maximum capacity of 15 people in a five bedroom finca. Therefore to increase our occupancy, we intend to renovate the 'Casa Curazon' into a self-contained suite, consisting of a kitchenette/lounge, bedroom and en-suite eco wet room. Ideally suited as a separate space for teacher accommodation or for those wishing more privacy. Lounge also provides extra sleeping accommodations. Funds will also be required to dress up the Casa Chakra, as well as all of the necessary fixtures such as beds, wardrobes, lamps and bedding etc...</p>

<div style=""margin-left: 210px;"">In order to accommodate groups of 30 or more we are building 10 Balinese inspired structures. Six of these will share eco toilets and eco showers whereas the remaining will have en-suite eco bathrooms. These  structures will be built on 3 separate tiers, as to blend into the secluded forest, providing a natural canopy on the mountainside by a natural spring ensuring complete privacy for our guests.</div>
<div style=""margin-left: 210px;""> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 210px;"">The eco showers will be constructed with recyclable materials. This entire area will be supplied with electricity, powered by a Keshe generator, the latest advancement in powercell technology.</div>

<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We have excellent Chefs who work on improving how we prepare our food, using only the best organic produce here on the island and working with the 'Blood Group' eating plan, whenever possible.

<div style=""margin-left: 60px;""> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Planting our own organic vegetable gardens and fruit trees will not only allow our Chefs to prepare meals for our guests with the freshest of organic ingredients but will also bring us one step closer to achieving our goal of self-sustainability. Our vision is to develop the farmland on 10/12 tiers, which contain some of the best soil on the island, for our gardens. All gardens will be watered via an irrigation system fed from a natural mountain top spring.</div>
</div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 60px;"">Red Road Lodge, the Shamanic Healing and Treatment area is situated below the vegetable gardens. Guided by her Vision Quest on the land, this location was chosen and sacredly blessed by Bear Medicine Song, our Shamanic Healer. These two levels are dedicated to Shamanic Healing, Sweat Lodges and Fire-Walking and many other sacred ceremonies, all lead by Bear Medicine Song. Funds are required to purchase materials to complete the Red Road Lodge, Sweat Lodge and landscaping of the surrounding area. The Fire-Walking level requires grading and seating to be built.</div>

</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Four levels will be developed for the creation of the ‘The Garden of Healing' spa. The first level, highlights the existing Balinese inspired structure which is to be refurbished as a reception area. Further along, the path ushers us to the existing eco-bathroom with solar shower for guests to freshen up before or after treatment.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;"">       <img alt=""Salt Pool"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/207734_190869974389643_1910732046_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>   <img alt=""The Garden of Healing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/16733_190873071056000_396548375_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;"">The continuing path to the second level takes us to the entrance of the treatment area, setting the scene with a shallow pond with waterfall features, crossed via stepping-stones steering you through a flower-covered pergola to the spa area. Funds are essential here to create the Spa from start to finish including the structures, ponds, water features, furnishing, linens, robes, towels, oils etc... On the far side of the treatment site, a set of stairs will be built to access our Sea Salt Plunge pool, on the third tier. The existing reservoir requires a complete re-vamping and seating built along the inner edges of the pool, providing an area to relax and detoxify after treatment, as well as, decking for the outer perimeter of the pool. The focal point on the fourth tier is yet again, another reservoir, which will need to be re-built as most of it has crumbled away. This pool will be infused with crystals for their healing properties.</p>

<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">
<p>The kitchen in the main house will also undergo a complete refurbishment to allow us to create a safer and more efficient work environment for our Chefs. </p>
<p>Last but not least, we will level and grade the roadway leading into Garden of Light Ibiza, as well as the entrance and road leading to the public parking area and the parking area itself. We will have to sub-contract the work out or rent heavy machinery for the work to be completed in a professional manner, either way, a costly project but one that will enhance our guest’s arrival to our sanctuary. The driveway and entrance will need sprucing upwith plants, flowers and shrubberies, as well as, erecting a new gated structure securing the property.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Another facet of the abundance offered to us by the land, is our own water supply, from a mountain fed source.  The development consists of the capping of the reservoir, as well as having a filtering system installed to remove excess minerals, providing us with clear, clean, refreshing mountain drinking water. The reservoir will also supply water to our eco bathrooms throughout the property, as well as, our garden irrigation system.</div>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A point of pride for us is that we operate on solar power energy. This is another area we wish to develop further by educating ourselves and by helping to educate others on how to live a more self-sustainable and ecological life. Our intentions are to have solar lighting throughout the outdoor areas, such as entrance to the property, driveway, parking lot, terraces, pathways and pools, waterfalls, heated water supply for eco bathrooms, as well as providing guests with solar pads for charging their phones and computers, so pretty much wherever we can. We are also exploring the possibility of generating our own energy supply using turbines and the running mountain water.</div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">It is our mission to continue and build on to the wonderful work and vision of Lourdes, allowing the Garden of Light Ibiza to grow organically, with the introduction of a variety of new workshops. We aspire to create safe spaces for individuals who may be in a vulnerable situation or very fragile, we want to continue to support every aspect of the human mind, body, and spirit. With the premise, licensed as a private school for Yoga and Human Development, the possibilities for the types of retreats, workshops and events we will be able to offer, are only limited by our collective imaginations!</div>

WHAT IS THE GARDEN OF LIGHT IBIZA?
Hidden away in a valley surrounded by Mother Nature and her healings properties, The Garden of Light Ibiza, has been licensed as a school of Yoga and Human Development, for the past 18 years. It is situated in San Miguel, in the north of Ibiza, very close to the famous 'Benirras Beach'. You can escape from the outside world and be transported to this magical sanctuary of natural beauty, simplicity, tranquility.....BLISS!! 
            
Lourdes is the heart and soul of ‘The Garden of Light’. Born in Bilbao, loving simplicity and nature, she has been living in the countryside of Ibiza for more than 30 years. For the past 18 years, Lourdes, with the love and support of many wonderful beings, has created an oasis of transformation, 'The Garden of Light'.  Her passion to improve human conditions and to discover the mysteries of life, brought her to experiment and connect with a wide variety of different teachings, techniques, philosophies, masters, etc... We are proud to be continuing and growing the wonderful work that Lourdes has started and having her as part of our family.      





We are a small family run community with a beautiful vision. Our team is one of our strongest assets. They not just staff, they are an integral part of the Center, sharing with the guests their knowledge, beliefs, experiences, support and friendship whilst allowing for their own personal and spiritual journey to thrive. We have an award winning background in running Spiritual Development Retreats as ‘Psychic Retreats’ both Ibiza and the UK.    

























Our retreats have excellent levels of customer service with a high majority of guests reporting life-changing experiences. This really speaks volumes about the experience, care and service we offer our guests, prior to, during and after the retreat. We have been working and living here, at the Garden of Light Ibiza, for the past 8 months. During this time we have been visualizing and working hard to create a sanctuary of sacred spaces for meditating, healing, spiritual and personal growth.

 
 





















We aspire to bring many different forms of healing, spiritual, self-development and inspirational life changing workshops to the Garden of Light Ibiza. By raising awareness, we can raise spiritual vibrations and learn to view the world around us and how we live in it, from a new perspective.

 
 



















By combining all aspects of our lives, such as the way we live harmoniously as a family, our use of solar power to generate electricity, planting many gardens to grow our own food, eventually raising chickens and horses, using our mountain sourced water for irrigation and personal use to name a few, will help reduce our combined carbon footsteps. 

 
 














As well as hosting our own retreats, The Garden
of Light Ibiza will also be available to rent on an hourly, daily or weekly basis if you are interested in hosting your own course or special event. We are able to provide accommodations and our in house Chef will work with you to create a menu perfect for you and/or your groups needs and requirements.
 
DREAM….VISION….FUNDING....REALITY!!!!
The following is an overview of our vision and of our development plan.
The current accommodations are situated higher up the mountain side than the main Center and the dinning area. We must first create a path joining all the tiers together, creating a natural flow between the Center, the Healing Garden Spa, Red Road Lodge Healing and Treatment area, the Gardens, Casa Chakra and Balinese inspired accommodation.

      
We intend to build this pathway as organically as possible to enhance the beauty and functionality of the nature all around us, using stones and materials from the land wherever possible, as well as recyclable and recycled materials. Providing areas for relaxation, meditation, swimming or seating to just to rest and chill for a moment whilst overlooking beautiful mountain-views.
 

The Casa Chakra is our only accommodation, which allows for a maximum capacity of 15 people in a five bedroom finca. Therefore to increase our occupancy, we intend to renovate the 'Casa Curazon' into a self-contained suite, consisting of a kitchenette/lounge, bedroom and en-suite eco wet room. Ideally suited as a separate space for teacher accommodation or for those wishing more privacy. Lounge also provides extra sleeping accommodations. Funds will also be required to dress up the Casa Chakra, as well as all of the necessary fixtures such as beds, wardrobes, lamps and bedding etc...
 
 

In order to accommodate groups of 30 or more we are building 10 Balinese inspired structures. Six of these will share eco toilets and eco showers whereas the remaining will have en-suite eco bathrooms. These  structures will be built on 3 separate tiers, as to blend into the secluded forest, providing a natural canopy on the mountainside by a natural spring ensuring complete privacy for our guests.
 
The eco showers will be constructed with recyclable materials. This entire area will be supplied with electricity, powered by a Keshe generator, the latest advancement in powercell technology.


 

 

                     

 
The structure adjoining the Casa Chakra will also be renewed into living accommodations for full time staff ensuring the continuity of the care and service for our guests. This area will require a complete renovation including wiring, new roof, skylights, new windows, painting and to build a shared eco bathroom. The outer area will be cleared to provide outdoor seating and chill area.
                                                                      
              
We have excellent Chefs who work on improving how we prepare our food, using only the best organic produce here on the island and working with the 'Blood Group' eating plan, whenever possible. When working with Body, Mind and Spirit, experience has shown us that the easier it is for one to digest, the more one's energy can then be used in healing the body and raising one's spiritual vibration.


                                                               

        

 
Planting our own organic vegetable gardens and fruit trees will not only allow our Chefs to prepare meals for our guests with the freshest of organic ingredients but will also bring us one step closer to achieving our goal of self-sustainability. Our vision is to develop the farmland on 10/12 tiers, which contain some of the best soil on the island, for our gardens. All gardens will be watered via an irrigation system fed from a natural mountain top spring.

 
Red Road Lodge, the Shamanic Healing and Treatment area is situated below the vegetable gardens. Guided by her Vision Quest on the land, this location was chosen and sacredly blessed by Bear Medicine Song, our Shamanic Healer. These two levels are dedicated to Shamanic Healing, Sweat Lodges and Fire-Walking and many other sacred ceremonies, all lead by Bear Medicine Song. Funds are required to purchase materials to complete the Red Road Lodge, Sweat Lodge and landscaping of the surrounding area. The Fire-Walking level requires grading and seating to be built.
 
            

The Garden of Healing is a unique, outdoor healing center drawing inspiration from its surroundings, Mother Nature herself. Simply by just being in nature nurtures our soul! At The Garden of Healing we will provide a safe, loving and  supportive environment for you to heal, learn, grow and transform yourself.

  

Four levels will be developed for the creation of the ‘The Garden of Healing' spa. The first level, highlights the existing Balinese inspired structure which is to be refurbished as a reception area. Further along, the path ushers us to the existing eco-bathroom with solar shower for guests to freshen up before or after treatment.
          
The continuing path to the second level takes us to the entrance of the treatment area, setting the scene with a shallow pond with waterfall features, crossed via stepping-stones steering you through a flower-covered pergola to the spa area. Funds are essential here to create the Spa from start to finish including the structures, ponds, water features, furnishing, linens, robes, towels, oils etc... On the far side of the treatment site, a set of stairs will be built to access our Sea Salt Plunge pool, on the third tier. The existing reservoir requires a complete re-vamping and seating built along the inner edges of the pool, providing an area to relax and detoxify after treatment, as well as, decking for the outer perimeter of the pool. The focal point on the fourth tier is yet again, another reservoir, which will need to be re-built as most of it has crumbled away. This pool will be infused with crystals for their healing properties.
                    

The kitchen in the main house will also undergo a complete refurbishment to allow us to create a safer and more efficient work environment for our Chefs. 
Last but not least, we will level and grade the roadway leading into Garden of Light Ibiza, as well as the entrance and road leading to the public parking area and the parking area itself. We will have to sub-contract the work out or rent heavy machinery for the work to be completed in a professional manner, either way, a costly project but one that will enhance our guest’s arrival to our sanctuary. The driveway and entrance will need sprucing upwith plants, flowers and shrubberies, as well as, erecting a new gated structure securing the property.

 
Another facet of the abundance offered to us by the land, is our own water supply, from a mountain fed source.  The development consists of the capping of the reservoir, as well as having a filtering system installed to remove excess minerals, providing us with clear, clean, refreshing mountain drinking water. The reservoir will also supply water to our eco bathrooms throughout the property, as well as, our garden irrigation system.
 
                    

 
A point of pride for us is that we operate on solar power energy. This is another area we wish to develop further by educating ourselves and by helping to educate others on how to live a more self-sustainable and ecological life. Our intentions are to have solar lighting throughout the outdoor areas, such as entrance to the property, driveway, parking lot, terraces, pathways and pools, waterfalls, heated water supply for eco bathrooms, as well as providing guests with solar pads for charging their phones and computers, so pretty much wherever we can. We are also exploring the possibility of generating our own energy supply using turbines and the running mountain water.
 
It is our mission to continue and build on to the wonderful work and vision of Lourdes, allowing the Garden of Light Ibiza to grow organically, with the introduction of a variety of new workshops. We aspire to create safe spaces for individuals who may be in a vulnerable situation or very fragile, we want to continue to support every aspect of the human mind, body, and spirit. With the premise, licensed as a private school for Yoga and Human Development, the possibilities for the types of retreats, workshops and events we will be able to offer, are only limited by our collective imaginations!

<li>
<p>In other words... we need you.  Come join our tribe.  We have free coffee (with every class!)</p>

</ul></span></div>","Spring Into Yoga brings donation-based community Yoga & Zumba to NYC (and the world, through our website).


We have classes for adults.  Classes for kids.  Classes for everyone together, regardless of economic situation, race, religion, gender, age, ability...
Yoga.  Zumba. Together.  Stretching.  Working out.  Relaxing.  Learning.  Having fun.  Goofy, wonderful, ecstatic fun.  Together.


We believe that yoga, fitness, and wellness should be inexpensive, easily accessible, fun, and done together.


We have been giving classes outside all summer long, and to be able to continue serving NYC, we need a space.  To continue serving others, we need to produce free web content.  To do these things, we need your help.


 


So... uh... yeah.  You are probably wondering who we are.  


Spring Into Yoga started with Spring Into Yoga Festival in May 2013, and then quickly exploded into the organization that exists today, giving multiple classes weekly in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, and Central Park, Manhattan.  




Spring Into Yoga is run by Emily Buck, with help from a group of other certified (and certifiably awesome) yoga teachers and business-types including the majestic Sterling Silverhorse (who also has the best name, maybe, ever).  


We are currently in the process of registering as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.


 
 

We are trying to get a storefront, 
so that we can continue to bring classes to the community, while also creating a safe space for people to hang out, relax, and meet new friends.  We are also trying to provide free, quality content on our website to bring yoga, zumba, fitness, and community to others who are not in NYC.
 
 

Finding community in New York City is hard.  
(Surprisingly hard)


Do a quick Google search- there are hundreds of articles talking (and complaining) about it.  What better way to meet your neighbors than to bond over a shared passion, goal, or sweaty towel?  I can't think of any.
Finding community elsewhere isn't a piece of cake either. Unless you are amazing at just walking up to people and talking, which most of us aren't.
 



New York City is full of millions of people, and despite this, can be so impersonal.  


The beauty of this place lies in the moments that the walls between strangers break down.  The moment two people smile at the subway performer.  The moment someone holds a door open for you.  The moment   you accidentally kick someone in the face in yoga class, and then they ask you out on a date as you hand them an ice pack...  


We need more connection to others, and we are so scared to do it out on the street, or on public transportation.  


When everyone is trying to get fit, relax, and enjoy a class, we have something in common.  That is the moment when conversation can start, and friendship can be born.


  
 
That is Why Spring Into Yoga Needs a Studio Location.  

 
 
 

 



We need approximately $10,000 to secure a storefront rental, remodel it to our standards, and pay the first two months of rent.  


Getting a small business loan as a brand new nonprofit in a mostly for-profit industry is a tough sell.


Instead, we want to turn to the community- the same community that we wish to open our classes to, in order to create this space.  A space that is for you!


Most of all, we need people who like our idea, and want to come take class, and use our space!  


In other words... we need you.  Come join our tribe.  We have free coffee (with every class!)



 
 



Well, most importantly, you get a great new community yoga studio, unlike any other in NYC!  


You get to experience taking yoga classes next to a kid.  Or your grandma. Yoga with people you wouldn't normally do yoga with.  A stretching of the mind.


You get a safe, community space in which to hang out and relax.


You get classes especially for women, men, children, seniors, and beginners, as well as our signature all ages & abilities style class.


You get dubstep yoga friday nights.


You get a free cup of coffee, tea, or water with every yoga class (yep, free caffeine!).


You get nifty yoga workshops.


You get a book swap shelf at the studio, where you can drop off your old books, and take new ones home, free of charge!  It's like give a penny, take a penny, but with books.


You get board game rentals!  $1 an hour for a game.  Hang out and play with a friend. (stretch goal)


You get community movie nights, mixers, parties, and soirees. (stretch goal)


You get this great schedule full of classes...

If we raise an extra $3,000, we will have a weekly family film night on Saturdays, where we will show quality, family friendly movies.  This event will be absolutely free of charge, a service and thank you to the community.  For this, we need a projector and a means of connecting to the internet.
 


Everyone loves a good, rigorous yoga class, and doing yoga to techno or dubstep is a BLAST.  Enjoy this phenomenon even more with an actual, real, live DJ!  There will be one if we raise an extra $4,000

However, rent in most studio spaces in Brooklyn costs at least $35 an hour.  Rent in a storefront for a day could cost us about $100.  For the entire day.  We are really hoping that works out.

This space will be an amazing asset to a beautiful, blossoming community.  It's good for everyone if this happens.

We knew we could find a sophisticated solution - certainly better than just an ice pack and a dish cloth. </p><p>Fortunately, we know a thing or two about engineered ice and wearable cooling gear, so we decided to take cold therapy to the next level and challenged ourselves to build an escape pod for your head.</p><p>We asked our team, ""if cold therapy is one of the most trusted, natural and effective means of managing headache pain - then how can we leverage design and technology to go from good to better to best?""</p><p>We know we can't stop a headache or migraine from happening, or magically make it go away, but wouldn't it be great to have a better tool to deliver advanced cold therapy and help ease the discomfort?</p><p>We reached out to our instagram community with a crowd-design request for a wish list - and this advanced cold therapy project - Project Halo - started to take shape.</p><p>We set out to create the koldtec Halo with these main objectives in mind:</p><ul>
<li>wearable and hands-free</li>
<li>targeted cold therapy, so the cold is delivered only where you need it most</li>
<li>adjustable fit for loose and comfy or snug and secure</li>
<li>flexible ice that can bend and contour to the natural shape of your head</li>
<li>""sleep-able"" meaning you could fall asleep with it on </li>
<li>block out light and minimize sound</li>
<li>sustainable fabrics and eco-friendly materials where ever possible</li>
<li>locally made in Toronto</li>
</ul><p>We're happy to say....drumroll please...we did it!                                                                                         </p><p>Our team combined all of these wonderful design and functionality features and brought the koldtec Halo to life.  The escape pod for your head has been prototyped and tested; now it's all set and ready to go. We just need your support and financial commitment to flip the switch and begin production.</p><p>What makes the koldtec Halo so gosh darn great?</p><h3>Perfect Fit</h3><p>We've designed the koldtec Halo with an adjustable fit, so you can wear it loose and comfy or snug and secure.  We know that some folks like pressure and support - while others want a light and gentle touch.  We've allowed for ample space as you ultimately select how much ice to load and where; for a custom fit that's personally tailored to you. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571586915/m2aml44gobf2yomieer3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Wearable Cooling Gear</h3><p>Say goodbye to holding an ice pack against your neck or a wet facecloth on your forehead.

We knew we could find a sophisticated solution - certainly better than just an ice pack and a dish cloth. Fortunately, we know a thing or two about engineered ice and wearable cooling gear, so we decided to take cold therapy to the next level and challenged ourselves to build an escape pod for your head.We asked our team, ""if cold therapy is one of the most trusted, natural and effective means of managing headache pain - then how can we leverage design and technology to go from good to better to best?""We know we can't stop a headache or migraine from happening, or magically make it go away, but wouldn't it be great to have a better tool to deliver advanced cold therapy and help ease the discomfort?We reached out to our instagram community with a crowd-design request for a wish list - and this advanced cold therapy project - Project Halo - started to take shape.We set out to create the koldtec Halo with these main objectives in mind:
wearable and hands-free
targeted cold therapy, so the cold is delivered only where you need it most
adjustable fit for loose and comfy or snug and secure
flexible ice that can bend and contour to the natural shape of your head
""sleep-able"" meaning you could fall asleep with it on 
block out light and minimize sound
sustainable fabrics and eco-friendly materials where ever possible
locally made in Toronto
We're happy to say....drumroll please...we did it!                                                                                         Our team combined all of these wonderful design and functionality features and brought the koldtec Halo to life.  The escape pod for your head has been prototyped and tested; now it's all set and ready to go. We just need your support and financial commitment to flip the switch and begin production.What makes the koldtec Halo so gosh darn great?Perfect FitWe've designed the koldtec Halo with an adjustable fit, so you can wear it loose and comfy or snug and secure.  We know that some folks like pressure and support - while others want a light and gentle touch.  We've allowed for ample space as you ultimately select how much ice to load and where; for a custom fit that's personally tailored to you. Wearable Cooling GearSay goodbye to holding an ice pack against your neck or a wet facecloth on your forehead. True Wearable Cooling Gear aka the koldtec Halo, gives you the freedom of mobility without having to compromise with ice that slides around, slips off, falls off or otherwise doesn't stay in contact with your body. Our internal ice pockets keep your cold locked-in and secure. The secret: we've sourced a low profile hook 'n loop that's molded, not woven - making it about 50% softer and thinner than traditional Velcro. Advanced Cold TherapyWe've researched the key headache spots and specifically isolated ""pain point"" zones where headaches are most common. Then we designed 2 internal ice pockets that you can load with FlexIce strips as needed to target each different zone. So, whether your headache origin is migraine, tension, cluster or sinus - we've got ice therapy in the places you need it most. The koldtec Halo allows you to select the ice placement to fit your personal zones, providing the best combination of advanced cold therapy.  Up to 9 ounces of ice at once!Engineered FlexIceOur patented, engineered FlexIce delivers an instant and long lasting chill to the targeted spots you need it most.

<p><strong>Who We Are</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Graphis Health Center (GHC) provides critical health care to Cambodians living in rural areas with limited access to proper medical care due to poverty and remote locales.  Located in Prey Proseth Village, 120 km west of Phnom Penh, GHC is surrounded by 100 acres of forest and mountains—or what we like to call the Land.  Due to its location in middle of the jungle and near a major road, GHC has responded to and treated thousands of emergency and trauma patients since being founded in 2010 by Dr. Peter Li.  GHC is dedicated to providing the highest quality of care regardless of the financial or social status of our patients. </p>
<p>In an emergency, every second counts.  With the nearest hospital 80km away-for many, GHC is their only chance of survival. Patients who have suffered from accidents or trauma can be admitted as short or long-term in-patients to receive professional and compassionate palliative and rehabilitative care. All GHC medical staff are on call 24/7-and even at night, at least one staff is awake to check on our patient while the others take turns sleeping inside the health center.  </p>
<p>70% of GHC patients are out-patients.  In remote provinces, many villagers have never been treated by medical personnel and most have limited knowledge of basic health and hygiene practices. GHC provides health education, consultation, and treatment to local villagers from the surrounding rural provinces.  Some even travel hundreds of kilometers for our medical services. Many of our patients are children who come to us with severe infection, malaria, or dengue fever.  All of these are curable but without the proper diagnoses and treatments- they are fatal. </p>
<p>Although GHC is in the Cambodian jungle, we have the training, equipment, resourcefulness, and compassion to treat our patients at the highest standard. Our motto is simple-- we do the things we do so that others may live<strong>.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>A Profile of Our Sai</strong></p>
<p>In August 2011, GHC and Taiwanese medical volunteers from Chuang Gung Memorial Hospital responded to an emergency 90 km away from Phnom Penh.  When they arrived at the scene, the nearby villagers had already pulled the victims to the side of the road.  All the victims were only slightly injured except for one—Sai, a 26 year-old woman. </p>
<p>When the villagers pulled Sai from the car, it further exacerbated her injuries. GHC took Sai to a national hospital where she was diagnosed with a C5-C6 spinal injury – permanently paralyzing her from the neck down.</p>
<p>After one week, Sai was transferred to GHC for rehabilitation.  She stayed at GHC for a few days before her family requested us to take her home to be treated by a traditional healer.  One week later, Sai returned to GHC with severe infections and bedsores so deep you could see her tailbone.</p>
<p>When the family asked for GHC’s help, we admitted Sai as an in-patient.  Everyday, the GHC staff gave her antibiotics for her infection and spread iodine and sugar paste for her bedsores.  It wasn’t until weeks later that we discovered that Sai was pregnant!  GHC staff worked diligently to keep her and the baby alive.</p>
<p>On May 3<sup>rd</sup> 2012, Pich was born--a beautiful, healthy baby girl.  Sai and Pich are still with us at GHC today.  Sadly the family has not been in contact or shown her any support since the birth, but GHC staff continues to support Sai and her child with medical care, shelter, food, and clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Need Your Support</strong></p>
<p>The sad truth is that many of our patients are like Sai who come to us as their last resort.  Many have spent their life savings at private clinics in hopes of a cure but in the end are left with a mountain of debt and the effects of harmful treatments, which cause even more damage to their health.  Others are so sick/injured that they are a financial and emotional burden on their family, and as a result no one will take care of them.</p>
<p>This is why GHC started the Poor Patient Fund.  For those patients who cannot pay, we waive our $1.25 consultation fee and give them medicine and treatment for free. We aim to treat our patients until they are fully recovered so that they are not at-risk of developing more severe health issues in the future. However, the costs of continual check-ups and treatments add up very quickly.  </p>
<p>This is why GHC needs your support. For poor in-patients like Sai, we spend $400/month just on medical supplies.  We need at least $10,000 to effectively treat our poor patients for the next year. Every penny you donate will go directly to helping treat our patients who cannot afford any treatments or medications.</p>
<p><strong>Others Way You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We would appreciate any help you can give.  Even if you are not in a financial position to donate, you can still spread the word to your friends and family and through social networking websites like Facebook.  If you are interested in visiting GHC, donating medical supplies, or volunteering your services please email us at <a href=""mailto:info@cdepcambodia.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@cdepcambodia.org</a>.</p>

<p>We have the technology to create water infrastructures at a sophisticated level, worldwide. And, in Zambia, there is water in the ground already. And yet the people of Lusaka have little access to clean water. We can help by pitching in to fund a clean water unit.</p>
<p>  We have sophisticated water treatment and waste management systems and they are relatively inexpensive to create and install. So that's what we aim to do for the people of Chaisa Compound in Lusaka, Zambia.</p>
<p>  Here on IndieGoGo, anyone can help: Jet setter, diplomat, concerned citizens and students alike.   Sister Cities of Los Angeles is pleased to support the LA-Lusaka Sister City Committee's effort to create water access in our sister city Lusaka, Zambia.</p>
<p><strong>This project is led by the Los Angeles-Lusaka Sister City Committee; Dr. Ernestine Robertson (President, LA-LSCC), and <strong>Project Director<span id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1360618615835_2266""> Ms. Lidia Mongerie Brown</span></strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE CONTEXT  </strong></p>
<p>After the implementation of a successful Micro-Finance Project in nine contiguous areas of Lusaka, Zambia, the Los Angeles-Lusaka Sister City Committee's Women's Entrepreneur Program has embarked upon a desperately needed Clean Water Project at Chaisa Compound in the region of Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia.</p>

<p><strong>WHO ARE WE AND WHY ARE WE HERE?  </strong></p>
<p>The objective of this campaign is to raise funds for a Clean Water Project which integrates the provision of clean water with other environmental considerations such as water and waste treatment measures, disease reduction (malaria and diarrhea are both tied to morbidity rates and the need for ""better management of water resources reduces transmission of malaria and other vector-borne diseases""), and irrigation systems that are less than sufficient. </p>

<p>The citizens will be the primary stakeholders. The experts engaged to install the Clean Water Unit will have a working knowledge of water and waste systems, treatment processes and mechanical know how regarding septic and sewage and how they impact health and the environment.  </p>
<p><strong>THE CAMPAIGN GOAL  : A TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT<br/></strong></p>
<p>The funds raised in this campaign will allow the LA-Lusaka Sister City Committee to purchase initial hardware, software, supplies and human resources to develop a small scale clean water infrastructure. This will make a significant difference in the quality of life for Zambians in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chaisa-Compound-lusaka-Zambia/169515196426008"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chaisa Compound</a> and communities in and surrounding Lusaka.</p>
<p>The goal - simply put - is to provide access to clean water by building a <strong>clean water unit</strong>. This unit will not only help the citizens of Lusaka gain access to clean water, it will eventually also help improve waste water treatment, irrigation and recycling, sanitation and hygiene facilities and practices. </p>
<p>In time, this will provide better use of energy, maintenance of a green environment, and creation of jobs. Each measure, in its own right, will contibute to a sustainabie approach to water management.</p>

We have the technology to create water infrastructures at a sophisticated level, worldwide. And, in Zambia, there is water in the ground already. And yet the people of Lusaka have little access to clean water. We can help by pitching in to fund a clean water unit.
  We have sophisticated water treatment and waste management systems and they are relatively inexpensive to create and install. So that's what we aim to do for the people of Chaisa Compound in Lusaka, Zambia.
  Here on IndieGoGo, anyone can help: Jet setter, diplomat, concerned citizens and students alike.   Sister Cities of Los Angeles is pleased to support the LA-Lusaka Sister City Committee's effort to create water access in our sister city Lusaka, Zambia.
This project is led by the Los Angeles-Lusaka Sister City Committee; Dr. Ernestine Robertson (President, LA-LSCC), and Project Director Ms. Lidia Mongerie Brown.

<h3>Hello all!</h3>
<p>As first suggested on Facebook, in support of Dave Sharp from Safe Cycling Australia, I'm seeking 50 willing contributors of $20.00 AU to raise total funds of $1000.00 AU for the purchase of a road bike to get Dave on the road and mobile again.</p>
<p>This campaign will run for 60 days.</p>
<p>I don't personally know Dave Sharp and at time of writing, nor have I met him.</p>
<p>My interest in this is to see him in a position where he can participate in the very activity that he actively campaings for here in Brisbane, Australia.</p>
<p>Safe Cycling Australia (<a href=""http://www.safecyclingaustralia.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.safecyclingaustralia.org/</a> or <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/SafeCyclingAustralia?ref=stream"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/SafeCyclingAustralia?ref=stream</a>) is in my opinion, an easily digestible road safety message that ultimitely aides my safe return home to my family each and every time I go on the road.</p>
<p>I'm an enthusiast of spreading the word of Safe Cycling Australia for this very reason and I hope by wearing my Safe Cycling Australia jersey, little by little drivers will take notice, have adhoc discussion as they recall seeing it and perhaps ultimitely influence the condition of driver habbit, behaviour and tolerance - and in turn keep a few more Mums, Dads and Kids alive on our roads.<br/><br/>Like many people before Dave who have started their own ventures, they've had to make financial sacrifices to 'keep the boat afloat' of the venture they believe in.<br/><br/>My expectation is that perhaps Dave has made similar sacrifices, thus leaving him bikeless and unable to participate in the very activity he campaigns for, which to me - seems unreasonable.</p>
<p>What I don't think is unreasonable is to seek $20.00 contributions from willing participants to achieve this goal of $1000.00 </p>
<p>Hopefully you will agree same and my sincere thanks in anticipation of your consideration to getting Dave Sharp mobile again.</p>

<p>The title says it all, I'm having a hysterectomy on Wednesday, August the 28th (it was previously the 14th, but was postponed a second time) and because my job is so physical I won't be able to return to work for a whole 6 weeks. </p>
<p>I scheduled my surgery a month ago, and normally I would credit my late recovery fund on the fact that I do nothing better than procrastinate, but since LSU Hospital was in the process of being bought out by Childrens Hospital and Touro we weren't 100% sure the date was going to stay the same until recently. </p>
<p></p>If you're wondering why a man would need a hysterectomy, please look up FTM hysterectomy. 
<h3>Slow Summer = Slow Money</h3>
<p>Summers are slow in NOLA and since I haven't been working as much as I normally do the rest of the year I'll need <em>your</em> help to be able to survive the next month and a half. I think you deserve to know exactly what I'm doing with the money you're donating to keep me going until I get back to work.</p>
<p>Here is how things in my life go:</p>

<p>Now that we're done having the awkward money conversation let us take a look at what you get in return for helping me out! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have a lot of amazing talented friends who have been so kind to help me with gifts to offer y'all. Elizabeth and Kiernan have spent a lot of time screen printing some sweet posters and post cards, Casey has donated some of her handmade jewelry, and Emily has jars of lovely scented bath salts.</p>
