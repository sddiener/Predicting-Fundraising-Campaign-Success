<p>Thanks for viewing my Campaign page! My name is Codie and I would like to start by telling you a little bit about my self. I am 27 years old and I live in Perth Western Australia I grew up in the harsh Pilbara region of WA in a town called Dampier, I completed an apprenticeship at RioTinto as an instrument electrician which I begun when I was 16 years old (the first ever apprentice of that age) I am a hard and conscientious  worker and since completing my apprenticeship I have worked as a break down electrician for billion dollar out loading ports and am currently operating and maintaining  a gas and steam driven power station in perth WA, I am telling you all this because I believe it is imperative that you know who and what kind of person I am before you decide whether or not to fund my ambitions. I am a seriously hard worker and extremely passionate in what I believe in, I have had the great fortune to travel a majority of the world on all sorts of wild adventures and have currently come to the conclusion that I am not happy with the pathway I have chosen for myself...... I am working for the sake of working and living towards my next annual leave dates - I do not believe this is how life should be lived.</p>
<p>I am also a self proclaimed animal lover, I have seen first hand the violence and cruelty that can be handed out towards kind and innocent animals by the hand of our fellow man and it makes me wish that there was something I could do to help them! I adopted a mistreated Blue Heeler pup in 2010 and since that time have come to the realization that in some way I wish I could do more as I love her to bits and she MAY be somewhat of a spoilt dog now! I am an avid donator for SAFE and any other animal welfare company.</p>
<p>About two years ago I got into ""homebrewing"" I have had a lot of misfortunes in my life due to debilitating injuries which occurred from AFL and a car accident (18 bones broken and 4 surgeries) so I sadly had to give up my football aspirations and what was left inside of me felt like an empty void as I had no hobbies left to do until homebrewing came along, I took to homebrewing like a moth to a flame and have since become what my girlfriend would say ""obsessed"" it is like I have just discovered something that was never there before and gives me that feeling of butterflies in my stomach every taste test after  two weeks of hard work of creating the mash and distilling the final product.</p>
<p>My dream as I have said is to make WA's first dedicated spiced rum from all WA and Australian ingredients as a homage to this great country I call home, this venture will not be cheap I have saved and saved for this dream but I am still a long way off, the equipment and ingredients are not cheap and any type of real estate around Perth is VERY expensive!! I need YOUR help guys to get my idea off the ground and to make everyone proud of me and of this Great state that tends to be left in the shadows from the east.</p>
<p>I am looking at doing something like a part donation for every sale of my product to go towards animal welfare in Australia such as SAFE or RSPCA or even both! this is non negotiable I will be doing my part for the community no matter what happens but getting this idea working will assist in being able to do MORE and help more animals along the way.</p>
<p>I feel like I should also say that this donation money will also assist in getting me the best training out there to create the best quality spiced rum we can make! knowledge is power in this industry and the right education is a MUST for any entrepreneur looking to start out and be competitive.</p>

We have since played an ever growing role introducing issues that place favelas in the center of numerous policy debates in Rio, from <a href=""http://www.bit.ly/FavelaModelo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://bit.ly/LEED-Up"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">environmentally sustainable development</a> to <a href=""http://bit.ly/1b8Wqtt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">affordable housing</a>.<br/></p>
<blockquote>""By channeling and maintaining a spotlight on them, since 2010 we have helped thousands of families in two dozen communities threatened with eviction keep their homes or receive better compensations.""</blockquote>
<p>Over the next year, through August 2016, Rio de Janeiro will be in the global spotlight like it has never been before. Thousands of reporters will descend on the city, charged with producing stories. Many of them will be on Rio's favelas.</p>
<p>With this comes the opportunity to channel that spotlight in creative and productive ways, facilitating nuanced reporting that destigmatizes these <a href=""http://bit.ly/1TK0Ahe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">misunderstood</a> communities, often victims of <a href=""http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=15952"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lazy sensational journalism</a>.</p>
<p>This is important because, as our work has shown, good reporting leads to policy changes and outright reversals, compensation increases for residents facing eviction, and dramatic community empowerment. Just as importantly, however, it sets the record straight on Rio's favelas in a way that paves the way for productive future policies.</p>
<blockquote>""We happened upon something revolutionary. We’re taking hyper-local news from what were incredibly isolated, stigmatized and marginalized neighborhoods, and making them globally accessible... As a result outsiders' perceptions have changed, become more humane.""<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>With your help, if we're successful in this campaign, we can fully dedicate ourselves over the coming year, with no distractions, to:</p>
<p></p>

<b>Catalytic Communities</b> (<a href=""www.catcomm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.catcomm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CatComm</a>) is a 15-year-old community planning and advocacy nonprofit working on-the-ground across hundreds of Rio's favelas with local leaders and organizers. We have become known over the past 5 years for <a href=""http://www.rioonwatch.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RioOnWatch</a>, a news site and archive of Rio's pre-Olympic years and their impacts on Rio's favela communities, launched in May 2010.<p></p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div><div> <p>We've worked hard to build CatComm as leanly as possible. Our projection for this coming year is that 76% of resources brought into the organization will be in-kind, thanks to contributions of time and talent by collaborators and volunteers. This leaves only $118,000 to raise to guarantee every single service and then some, that we want to deliver in support of Rio's favelas through the Olympics. </p>
<p>Here's the breakdown (and feel free to <a href=""mailto:donate@catcomm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contact us</a> for more information!): </p>

With these deceptive translations come negative imagery around crime, violence and desperate poverty.</span></p><p>But when I started working in Rio's favelas as a participatory urban planner in 2000, I came to appreciate a host of qualities in these communities and to realize these translations and depictions are not accurate, and they are incredibly damaging to these communities.</p><p>A favela is simply a neighborhood that emerged from an unmet need for housing, where residents built their own environment, brick by brick, over generations. They are Rio's affordable housing stock and home to incredible cultural wealth and resilience. Though they began as squatter communities or slums, today Rio's favelas are almost universally consolidated and functional neighborhoods, housing nearly a quarter of Rio's population of 6 million. Because they were unregulated and developed organically, they are exceptionally diverse. Oftentimes producing overwhelming challenges, yes. But also producing intangible assets.</p><p>Over nearly 120 years, Rio's favelas have evolved into consolidated neighborhoods that are core to the identity that makes Rio unique. What they need now is investment and participatory development.</p><p><b>Catalytic Communities</b> works to creatively integrate favelas into the city of Rio and make Rio's communities into worldwide examples of effective urban development. We believe the qualities of Rio's favelas can inspire communities everywhere.</p><p>We work on one timely and unique project at a time, and put a lot of attention into the detail of our work. Trust in the communities we serve is our biggest asset and we have worked to cultivate this trust since 2000, building a network of thousands of favela organizers, leaders and journalists. Our first program, launched in 2001, was the world's first community solutions database for sharing favela solutions with the world, recognized by the Tech Museum in 2006. Our second major program was the Casa community technology hub, a community center in Rio's Port area that over 5 years supported 1200 local leaders from across Rio's favelas in digital training and networking. Our Casa was recognized as an 'actionable idea' for cities by the UN in 2006.</p><p>But what we've become most known for is our work since 2010 through <b><a href=""http://www.rioonwatch.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RioOnWatch</a> - Rio Olympics Neighborhood Watch - our watchdog news site</b>. When we saw our community network--and the assets of these communities--being affected by Olympics policies starting in 2010, we realized bringing these voices to the world stage would be critical. Since 2010 we have published nearly 1200 articles by community reporters and international observers, covering all aspects of Rio's urban development from favela perspectives. </p><p><b>We were the first</b> to publish about World Cup and Olympics evictions starting in 2010, and favela gentrification in 2011. We have increasingly played a role introducing issues and pushing the debate on Rio forward during this period. We've developed a rich collection of local knowledge with every turn of events documented. A critical tool for community organizers, journalists, researchers, urban planners and human rights advocates worldwide.</p><p>We've also <a href=""http://catcomm.org/media-mentions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">worked with</a> hundreds of Brazilian and international journalists to improve the quality of media coverage of favelas, to reduce the stigma and raise awareness of these communities' qualities and what's at stake as favelas are forcibly evicted and as police incursions become a daily reality. We <a href=""http://bit.ly/ROWDigests"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">monitor media coverage</a> of favelas on a daily basis, studying the changes in coverage of favelas since 2008 through next year's Olympics.</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, through our coverage we've seen policy changes, reversals, compensation increases for residents, and dramatic community empowerment.</p><p>This year we launched <b><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/rioonwire"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RioONWire</a></b>, the world's first favela news wire. In its first 3 months we tweeted over 2000 times. Anyone in the world can now follow, in real time, bite-sized event updates and breaking news from Rio's favelas, in English, with background and context provided throughout the day. RioONWire was created to inform reporters arriving in Rio in the months leading up to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, so they have access to productive story topics and insight from Rio's favelas on deadline, but it is proving useful to groups ranging from housing organizers and human rights defenders to Rio residents and researchers.</p><p><b>We happened upon something revolutionary. </b>We're taking hyper-local news from what were incredibly isolated, stigmatized and marginalized neighborhoods, and making them globally accessible, by anyone with basic English and Web access. We organize and curate information so anyone arriving at it can follow specific communities, stories, policies or issues. As a result the perceptions of outsiders who come in contact with our work have changed, become more humane. </p><p>If we can take advantage of this unique moment to expand our reach, providing nuance, fairness and accuracy in favela reporting, we'll reach a tipping point, and public perceptions will unequivocally switch, as will policies towards favelas.<br/></p><p><b>Now, we need your help. </b>We get requests for support from Rio's favelas every single hour. And the speed and intensity is only growing through the 2016 Olympics and Paralympic Games.</p><p><span>You've heard of the <a href=""http://bit.ly/VilaAut"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">struggle that residents of Vila Autódromo have suffered</a>. This is the long-standing favela next to the future Olympic Park. Most of Vila Autódromo's 600 families have now been evicted, but a hundred or so remain. If evicted, they will join the <a href=""http://reut.rs/18RBNEL"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">20,000 families who have already been forcibly evicted</a> in the lead-up to the Rio Olympics<span></span>. They've become an international symbol of resistance in the face of enormous commercial pressure. Since 2009 RioOnWatch and our work with journalists has been key to tracking events unfolding here and making much of that visibility possible. We have documented this resistance and the city's policies towards the community step-by-step, making their case crystal clear to the international community and allowing reporters and researchers to follow the case.</span><br/></p><p>The next year will be the most important year ever for our work. We need to be able to respond to communities without the constant interruption of fundraising and remanaging what we can do to match budget shortfalls. We need to be able to reach our full potential during this critical period.</p><blockquote>""This last year before the start of the 2016 Olympic Games will be the most important ever for our work.""</blockquote><p>We have a unique window of opportunity through the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and we are asking for your help to realize our 'RioOnWatch Media Package'. The intense media activity surrounding Rio de Janeiro over this coming year will provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to set the record straight on Rio's favelas. </p><p><b>If we are successful in our crowd funding campaign, we will:</b></p><ul>
<li><p><b>Maintain RioOnWatch's momentum year-long</b>, bringing the latest news from Rio's favelas to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Grow RioOnWatch with a network of <b>new community correspondents and favela opinion leaders</b> providing weekly updates from across Rio's hard-to-reach zones.</p></li>
<li><p>Grow <b>RioOnWatchTV</b> and social video using Facebook, making favela assets and struggles globally visible and accessible.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Guarantee RioONWire a public resource</b>, free of charge, providing hourly updates on latest developments in Rio's favelas year-long.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Launch</b> <b>FavelaWire</b>, a direct Twitter feed handled by dozens of favela organizers city-wide.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Provide journalists with a weekly update</b> on the prior week's main headlines, next week's events, and story leads.</p></li>

<b>Open a physical hub for favela advocates, communicators, international journalists and Olympics visitors</b> from June-August 2016 to hold networking events, exchanges, debates, meetings and presentations all aimed at shortening the distance between favela perspectives and the global community in the lead-up and during the 2016 Games.</li></ul>Catalytic Communities has become a trusted resource and connector for Brazilian and international journalists focused on Rio, and the opportunity for us to support quality story production will only grow in the coming year. We want to be able to meet this opportunity by providing all of these services, linking hyperlocal news to global audiences, over the coming year.<p></p><p>We are asking you to help Catalytic Communities reach our fundraising goal of $78,240. <span> Only with your help can we guarantee Rio's favelas receive the attention and support they need through the 2016 Olympic Games.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Should we be successful in this campaign, we will be freed up to focus 100% on our core support of favelas through August 2016. For example, if we reach our goal our annual Rio Raffle will not be necessary and an additional full month of our work will be freed up for our core activities. But since the mileage donations will still be available, as a thank you to all our supporters in any capacity this year, including volunteers, researchers, and yes--you, all participants in this campaign--come December 31st we will choose one person at random to visit us, with a friend, in Rio next year.</span></p><p></p>And if you're wondering what we've got planned for after the Olympics? Well, when the Olympics and Paralympics are over, we will complete and publish our <a href=""http://bit.ly/1gLsgTO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">longitudinal Media Analysis</a> report of global coverage of Rio's favelas since 2008, as well as conduct our final Favela Perceptions Survey, looking at how impressions of favelas have changed, worldwide, since 2010. Our Media Package will be complete with a ""RioOnWatch Replication Manual"" that citizen groups around the world can use to replicate our efforts in their towns over years to come. And we plan to publish RioOnWatch in photo book form and retire RioOnWatch as a historical document of these pre-Olympic years. We will then build our next program on the back of these pre-Olympics achievements: policies and programs in Rio's favelas that are asset-based and focused on consolidating favelas' potential as vehicles for sustainable urban development.<div>

<h3><i><h4>Desde 2010, mais de 20.000 famílias de favelas foram removidas de suas casas para dar lugar a obras Olímpicas. Temos um ano até as Olimpíadas, e precisamos da sua ajuda.</h4></i></h3>
<h3>A Campanha</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p><b>O <a href=""http://www.rioonwatch.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RioOnWatch</a> se tornou o principal portal de notícias internacional para acompanhar os pontos de vista de moradores das <a href=""http://bit.ly/1Ir1zOL"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">favelas</a></b> sobre as rápidas transformações que vem ocorrendo no Rio de Janeiro, em decorrência dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016. Com a intensidade das mudanças e nossa crescente visibilidade, chamadas urgentes para apoiar favelas do Rio agora nos chegam todos os dias. Nós devemos estar prontos para responder a esses chamados dando suporte em tempo real e ao mesmo tempo podendo expandir os tipos de serviço de comunicação que oferecemos para aproveitar a oportunidade desta janela de destaque única que temos até os Jogos. </p>
<p>Nós fomos os primeiros a publicar sobre as <a href=""http://bit.ly/X51Qvb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">remoções</a> para a Copa do Mundo e as Olimpíadas, que começaram em 2010, e sobre a <a href=""http://bit.ly/184FqS4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gentrificação</a> das favelas em 2011. Desde então, nós temos desempenhado um papel cada vez maior na introdução de questões que colocam as favelas no centro de inúmeros debates políticos no Rio, desde <a href=""http://bit.ly/1tXIMhT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">desenvolvimento </a><a href=""http://bit.ly/1tXIMhT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">desenvolvimento sustentável</a> até <a href=""http://bit.ly/18By5Os"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">habitação a preços acessíveis</a>.</p>
<blockquote>“Ao canalizar e manter o foco sobre elas, desde 2010 nós ajudamos milhares de famílias em várias comunidades ameaçadas de remoção, a manterem suas casas e receberem melhores compensações.” </blockquote>
<p>Ao longo do próximo ano, até agosto de 2016, o Rio vai estar sob o holofote global como nunca esteve antes. Milhares de repórteres desembarcarão na cidade, encarregados de produzir notícias. Muitas delas serão sobre as favelas do Rio. </p>
<p>A partir disso, teremos a oportunidade de canalizar toda essa atenção de forma criativa e produtiva, facilitando reportagens diferenciadas com maior nuance, perspectivas de moradores, e que sirvam para desestigmatizar as comunidades cariocas, <a href=""http://bit.ly/1HUyOaR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tradicionalmente vítimas</a> do <a href=""http://bit.ly/VucFh6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jornalismo sensacionalista e preguiçoso</a>.</p>
<p>Isto é importante. Como o nosso trabalho tem demonstrado, boas reportagens levam a mudanças e até reversõess de política, aumentos nas indenizações para moradores vítimas de remoções, e um grau de empoderamento comunitário expressivo. Tão importante quanto isso, no entanto, é um garantir um registro clarificador sobre as favelas do Rio de Janeiro de forma a ser capaz de abrir o caminho para políticas futuras produtivas. </p>
<blockquote>""Nós estamos fazendo acontecer algo revolucionário. Estamos trazendo a público notícias hiper-locais advindas de regiões que eram altamente isoladas, estigmatizadas e marginalizadas, e tornando-as acessíveis globalmente… Como resultado as percepções de pessoas de fora estão mudando, se tornando mais humanas...""</blockquote>
<p>Com sua ajuda, se formos bem sucedidos nessa campanha, poderemos nos dedicar completamente ao longo do próximo ano, sem distrações, a: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Manter o ímpeto do RioOnWatch </b>ao longo do ano, trazendo as últimas notícias de favelas do Rio para você.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Expandir o RioOnWatch</b> com uma rede de novos <b>correspondentes comunitários</b> e publicar <b>opiniões</b> de formadores de opinião das favelas cariocas, fornecendo atualizações semanais de zonas de difícil alcance do Rio de Janeiro.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Expandir o RioOnWatchTV</b> e vídeos sociais usando o Facebook, tornando as qualidades das favela e suas lutas globalmente visíveis e acessíveis.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Garantir o RioOnWire</b> como uma fonte de noticias pública, gratuita, fornecendo atualizações de hora em hora no Twitter sobre os últimos acontecimentos nas favelas do Rio ao longo do ano.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Não deixe de ler, abaixo, a mensagem da nossa Diretora Executiva, Theresa Williamson, com a descrição completa sobre as razões dessa campanha ser tão importante e também sobre o que faremos com seu apoio. </p>

<h3>Quem somos</h3>
<p>A <b>Comunidades Catalisadoras </b>(<a href=""http://www.comcat.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ComCat</a>) é uma organização sem fins lucrativos, existente há 15 anos, de planejamento comunitário e advocacy trabalhando localmente com centenas de favelas do Rio junto à líderes e mobilizadores locais. Nós nos tornamos conhecidos nos últimos 5 anos devido ao <a href=""http://rioonwatch.org.br"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RioOnWatch</a>, um site de noticias e arquivo dos registros dos anos pré-olímpicos do Rio e seus impactos nas comunidades do Rio, lançado em maio de 2010. </p>

<p></p>
<h3>O que nós precisamos</h3>
<p>Temos nos esforçado para construir a ComCat da forma mais enxuta possível. Nossa projeção para o próximo ano é que 76% dos recursos trazidos à organização serão em espécie, graças às contribuições de tempo e talento de centenas de colaboradores e voluntários. Por isso, precisamos arrecadar apenas R$380.343,00 para garantir cada um destes serviços, e também lançar mais alguns novos serviços oportunos às favelas do Rio até as Olimpíadas. </p>
<p>Aqui está a divisão dos custos (e sinta-se livre de <a href=""mailto:comcat@comcat.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""mailto:crowd@catcomm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nos contatar</a> para mais informação!): </p>

<p>Como se vê, com esta campanha, especificamente, concentramos nos US$78.240 necessários para garantir o RioOnWatch, o programa de Correspondentes Comunitários e o <a href=""http://bit.ly/1KoWnux"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RioOnWatchTV</a>. Com isso, se formos bem sucedidos, vamos ser capazes de expandir significativamente a qualidade e a cobertura das vozes das favelas até os Jogos Olímpicos de 2016. Se exceder esse objetivo, no entanto, uma série de outros programas também se tornarão possíveis... <a href=""http://bit.ly/1SaVb4p"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RioONWire</a>, nosso noticiário no Twitter, recentemente tornado público, poderá ser mantido, e nós iremos:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lançar o <b>FavelaWire</b>, uma fonte de notícias no Twitter diretamente gerenciada por uma grande rede de mobilizadores de favelas por toda a cidade.</p></li>
<li><p>Fornecer a jornalistas um<b> resumo semanal </b>sobre as principais manchetes da semana anterior, eventos da próxima semana e pautas para notícias pedidas por mobilizadores locais.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Conectar jornalistas olímpicos com pautas</b> trazidas por centenas de mobilizadores das favelas do Rio de Janeiro.</p></li>
<li><p>Publicar artigos de <b>opinião</b>, regularmente, em meios de comunicação internacionais de grande alcance, onde constarão as perspectivas e a visão que nós representamos em termos de assuntos como o direito à moradia, integração urbanística e desenvolvimento comunitário.</p></li>
<li><p>Finalmente, se nós superarmos a meta e arrecadarmos mais de $118.000, durante junho-agosto de 2016, nós abriremos um <b>espaço físico para mobilizadores de favela</b>, comunicadores, jornalistas internacionais e visitantes dos Jogos Olímpicos para a criação de redes de contato, intercâmbios, debates, reuniões e apresentações, todas destinadas a encurtar a distância entre as perspectivas da favela e a comunidade global.</p></li>

<h3>O que você recebe</h3>
<p>Como forma de agradecimento por sua ajuda, haverá uma chuva de brindes!  </p>
<p>Amigos e colaboradores disponibilizaram vários brindes de agradecimento incríveis, desde fotos das favelas do Rio de tirar o fôlego até obras de arte únicas, livros sobre as Olimpíadas autografados, estadia de uma semana no Rio, uma visita a uma favela com a nossa equipe e até uma palestra de nossa Diretora Executiva em seu evento.</p>
<p>Cada um de vocês será agradecido publicamente no Twitter e reconhecido no nosso site. Se você tem um projeto pessoal ou profissional que queira compartilhar, nós o mencionaremos em nosso Twitter. E ficaremos felizes em promover um projeto em que você esteja envolvido ou entusiasmado por intermédio de nossa campanha, então por favor nos conte sobre ele.</p>
<p>Nós estamos muito empolgados com o fato dessa campanha estar oferecendo uma oportunidade de celebrar a nossa rede de colaboradores e apoiadores apaixonados e talentosos, e nos unir como uma comunidade que assegura o desenvolvimento igualitário das favelas do Rio e de outras comunidades por todo o mundo. É incrível o que vocês todos nos ajudaram a conquistar ao longo desses 5 anos de RioOnWatch! Vamos ver o que podemos fazer nos unindo nesse último ano antes das Olimpíadas de 2016. </p>

<h3>Outras formas de ajudar </h3>
<p>Nós estabelecemos a doação mínima de US$7 (R$24) com esperança de que, dessa forma, todos possam participar. Mas, para atingir nosso objetivo, o mais importante é a divulgação:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Qual é a coisa mais importante que você pode fazer? Estabelecer um objetivo pessoal e espalhar a novidade para seus amigos e familiares através de <b>emails personalizados</b>: 1. Escreva os endereços de email de todos que você conhece--familiares, amigos e colegas--que você acha que podem contribuir. 2. Envie-os emails personalizados e individuais perguntando se eles consideram a possibilidade de contribuir com a nossa campanha. 3. Mencione sua meta. Pessoas que clicam no link da página de uma campanha de um email direto e personalizado tendem, em média, a contribuir 25% mais do que outros visitantes. E ainda mais quando sabem que ajudarão a um amigo a atingir uma meta pessoal.</p></li>
<li><p>Você faz parte de algum clube ou grupo? Pergunte se você pode <b>fazer um comunicado curto</b> no final da próxima reunião e falar com as pessoas sobre o projeto. ""Olá, estou participando de uma arrecadação de fundos online, para ajudar as comunidades das favelas nos Jogos Olímpicos e Paraolímpicos, e eu espero contar com a sua ajuda. O mínimo para doar é de US$7 ou R$24. Eu estabeleci a meta de arrecadar “X"". Mais uma vez, as pessoas respondem melhor à pedidos individuais ou feitos pessoalmente. </p></li>
<li><p>Faça barulho sobre a campanha nas <b>redes sociais</b>! Nós postaremos diariamente recursos que você pode usar, no Facebook <a href=""http://on.fb.me/1lqkqP1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aqui</a> e no Twitter <a href=""http://bit.ly/1mM8NSf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aqui</a>.

<h3>Mensagem completa de nossa Diretora Executiva</h3>
<p><b><a href=""http://bit.ly/1uRzOcM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">O termo ""favela""</a> </b><span>é traduzido como 'slum' (bairro sórdido), 'shantytown' (vila de barracos), 'squatter community’ (comunidade de invasores) ou mesmo 'gueto'. Estes termos evocam imagens negativas relativas a crime, violência e pobreza.</span></p>
<p>Porém, quando eu comecei a trabalhar em favelas do Rio de Janeiro como planejadora urbana participativa, em 2000, eu comecei a apreciar uma série de qualidades nestas comunidades e percebi que essas traduções e representações não são precisas, e são incrivelmente prejudiciais para as comunidades.</p>
<p>Uma favela é simplesmente um bairro que surgiu a partir de uma necessidade não atendida de habitação, onde os moradores construíram seu próprio ambiente, tijolo por tijolo, ao longo de gerações. Elas atendem a demanda por moradias a preços acessíveis no Rio e abrigam uma incrível riqueza cultural e resiliência. Embora elas começaram como comunidades precárias de posseiros, as favelas do Rio hoje são quase universalmente vizinhanças consolidadas e funcionais, que abrigam quase um quarto da população do Rio de 6 milhões. Devido ao fato destas comunidades não serem regulamentadas, elas foram desenvolvidas organicamente, e por isso são excepcionalmente diversas. Muitas vezes produzindo desafios esmagadores, sim. Mas também produzindo ativos intangíveis. </p>
<p>Ao longo de quase 120 anos, as favelas do Rio evoluíram para vizinhanças consolidadas que são fundamentais para a identidade que faz do Rio uma cidade única. O que precisamos agora é de investimento e desenvolvimento participativo.</p>
<p><b>A Comunidades Catalisadoras</b> trabalha para integrar criativamente favelas na cidade do Rio e tornar as comunidades do Rio de Janeiro exemplos mundiais de desenvolvimento urbano eficaz. Acreditamos que as qualidades das favelas do Rio podem inspirar comunidades em todo o mundo.</p>
<p>Nós trabalhamos em um projeto pontual e único de cada vez, e colocamos toda atenção em cada detalhe do nosso trabalho. A confiança das comunidades que servimos é o nosso maior trunfo e temos trabalhado para cultivar essa confiança desde 2000, através da construção de uma rede de milhares de organizadores, lideranças e comunicadores comunitários. Nosso primeiro programa, lançado em 2001, foi o primeiro banco de dados aberto de soluções comunitárias para a partilha de soluções de favela com o mundo, reconhecido pelo Tech Museum em 2006. Nosso segundo grande programa foi o telecentro Casa do Gestor Catalisador, um centro comunitário na região portuária do Rio que por 5 anos apoiou 1.200 mobilizadores locais de favelas em todo o Rio com treinamento digital, espaços de troca e redes de apoio. Nossa Casa foi reconhecida como uma ""idéia acionável” para as cidades pelas Nações Unidas em 2006.</p>
<p>Mas o que nos tornou mais conhecido foi o nosso trabalho, desde 2010, através do <b><a href=""http://rioonwatch.org.br"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RioOnWatch</a>—Rio Olympics Neighborhood Watch—nosso site de relatos das favelas</b>, traduzido para o português como ‘Comunidades do Rio de Olho nas Olimpíadas”. A partir de 2010, quando vimos nossa rede comunitária—e as qualidades dessas comunidades—sendo negativamente afetadas pelas políticas de preparo para os Jogos Olímpicos, percebemos que trazer essas vozes para o palco mundial seria crucial. Desde 2010 temos publicado cerca de 1200 artigos de jornalistas comunitários e observadores internacionais, abrangendo todos os aspectos do desenvolvimento urbano do Rio sob a ótica de moradores das favelas.</p>
<p>Nós <b>fomos os primeiros</b> a publicar sobre as remoções, devido a Copa do Mundo e Jogos Olímpicos a partir de 2010, e a introduzir o conceito de gentrificação das favelas a partir de 2011. Temos atuado cada vez mais no papel de introduzir questões e levar adiante o debate sobre o Rio durante este período. Nós desenvolvemos um rico acervo de conhecimento local com todas as etapas dos eventos documentadas. Uma ferramenta crucial para mobilizadores comunitários, jornalistas, pesquisadores, urbanistas e defensores dos direitos humanos em todo o mundo.</p>
<p>Também temos <a href=""http://bit.ly/1obvTSn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trabalhado com</a> centenas de jornalistas brasileiros e internacionais para melhorar a qualidade da cobertura da grande mídia sobre as favelas, para reduzir o estigma e aumentar a consciência das qualidades dessas comunidades que estão em risco, dado que favelas estão sendo removidas e ocupações policiais se tornaram uma realidade diária. Nós monitoramos a cobertura da grande mídia global sobre as favelas diariamente, estudando as mudanças na cobertura de favelas desde 2008 em função dos Jogos Olímpicos.</p>
<p>E o mais importante, através da nossa cobertura vimos mudanças e reversões políticas, aumentos de indenizações para moradores vítimas de remoçõess, e empoderamento expressivo da comunidade.</p>
<p>Este ano lançamos o <a href=""http://bit.ly/1SaVb4p"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>RioONWire</b></a>, a primeira fonte de micro-notícias dinâmica de favela do mundo no Twitter. Em seus primeiros 3 meses, tuitamos mais de 2000 vezes. Qualquer pessoa no mundo pode agora acompanhar, em tempo real, atualizações de eventos e notícias ao vivo das favelas do Rio de Janeiro, em inglês, com histórico e contexto fornecido durante todo o dia. O RioONWire foi criado para informar aos repórteres que chegarão ao Rio nos meses que antecedem os Jogos Olímpicos e Paraolímpicos, para que eles tenham acesso a tópicos e notícias produtivos e uma percepção mais apurada sobre as favelas do Rio de Janeiro, sem desculpa de prazos estipulados por seus editores impedindo uma apuração cautelosa. Mas o RioONWire já está se provando útil para diversos grupos, desde técnicos de habitação, à defensores de direitos humanos, cidadãos cariocas e pesquisadores.</p>
<p><b>Nós estamos fazendo acontecer algo revolucionário.</b> Estamos trazendo a público notícias hiper-locais advindas de regiões que eram altamente isoladas, estigmatizadas e marginalizadas, e tornando-as acessíveis globalmente, para qualquer pessoa com inglês básico e acesso à internet. Nós organizamos e gerimos as informações de modo que qualquer pessoa possa seguir comunidades, histórias, políticas ou questões específicas. Como resultado as percepções de pessoas de fora estão mudando, se tornando mais humanas.</p>
<p>Se pudermos aproveitar este momento único para expandir nosso alcance, proporcionar nuance e uma visão justa e precisa nas reportagens sobre favelas, nós vamos chegar a um ponto crítico de conscientização, e as percepções públicas irão mudar de vez, assim como as políticas em prol das favelas.</p>
<p>Agora, nós precisamos da sua ajuda. Recebemos pedidos de apoio de moradores de favela do Rio a cada hora. E a velocidade e a intensidade só irá aumentar com a proximidade das Olimpíadas de 2016 e dos Jogos Paraolímpicos.</p>
<p>Você já ouviu falar da <a href=""http://bit.ly/Nfddvg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">luta que os moradores da Vila Autódromo enfrentam</a>. Esta é uma favela de longa data ao lado do futuro Parque Olímpico. A maioria das 600 famílias da Vila Autódromo já foram removidas, mas mais de uma centena permanece. Eles estão entre as <a href=""http://bit.ly/1JrtKxG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dezenas de milhares de famílias que estão sendo removidas</a> para os preparativos dos Jogos Olímpicos no Rio. Eles se tornaram um símbolo internacional de resistência em face da enorme pressão comercial. Desde 2009 o RioOnWatch e nosso trabalho com jornalistas têm sido fundamental para rastrear os desdobramentos dos eventos no local e gerar a maior visibilidade possível. Nós documentamos essa resistência e as políticas da Prefeitura para com a comunidade passo-a-passo, tornando o caso cristalino para a comunidade internacional, tornando acessível aos jornalistas e pesquisadores o acompanhamento do caso.</p>
<p>O próximo ano será o ano mais importante até agora para o nosso trabalho. Temos de ser capazes de responder a comunidades sem a interrupção constante de captação de recursos e remanejamento que fazemos para corresponder déficits orçamentários. Precisamos ser capazes de alcançar nosso pleno potencial durante este período crítico.</p>
<blockquote>""Este último ano, antes do início dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016, será o mais importante até agora para o nosso trabalho.""</blockquote>
<p>Temos uma única brecha muito oportuna através dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016 e nós estamos pedindo sua ajuda para realizar o nosso 'Pacote de Mídia RioOnWatch’'. A intensa atividade midiática abarcando o Rio ao longo do próximo ano poderá proporcionar uma oportunidade única para redefinirmos, de forma justa, a imagem das favelas do Rio.</p>
<p><b>Se formos bem sucedidos em nossa campanha, iremos:</b></p>

<p>A Comunidades Catalisadoras tem se tornado um recurso confiável e um conector para mobilizadores locais com jornalistas brasileiros e internacionais focados no Rio, e a oportunidade para apoiarmos a produção de matérias de qualidade só irá aumentar ao longo do próximo ano.

<p>Nós estamos pedindo a sua ajuda para que a Comunidades Catalisadoras alcance o seu objetivo de captação de US$78.240. Só com a sua ajuda é que poderemos garantir que as favelas do Rio recebam a atenção e apoio necessário até os Jogos Olímpicos de 2016.</p>
<p>Caso sejamos bem sucedidos com esta campanha, estaremos aptos para nos concentrarmos 100% em nosso apoio total às favelas até agosto de 2016. Isso também quer dizer que se formos bem sucedidos nossa Rio Rifa anual não será necessária e um mês inteiro adicional de nosso trabalho normalmente gasto com a rifa, será liberado para as nossas atividades principais. Mas dado que a doação de milhas e hospedagem para a rifa terá sido feita, como um agradecimento a todos os nossos apoiadores, a qualquer título este ano, incluindo voluntários, pesquisadores e sim—você e todos os participantes nesta campanha—no próximo 31 de dezembro, vamos sortear uma pessoa para visitar-nos, com direito a um acompanhante, no Rio no próximo ano.</p>
<p>E se você está se perguntando o que temos planejado para depois dos Jogos Olímpicos? Bem, quando os Jogos Olímpicos e Paraolímpicos terminarem, vamos concluir e publicar a nossa pesquisa de análise de cobertura midiática global longitudinal (não temos está página em português) sobre as favelas do Rio de Janeiro desde 2008, bem como conduzir nossa pesquisa final sobre a mudança nas percepções das favelas, observando como as impressões sobre as favelas mudaram, a nível mundial, desde 2010. Nosso pacote de mídia será concluído com um ""Manual de Replicação do RioOnWatch"", do qual grupos de cidadãos de todo o mundo poderão usar para replicar nossos esforços em suas cidades ao longo dos anos vindouros. E nós planejamos publicar o RioOnWatch em forma de um livro ilustrado transformando o RioOnWatch em um documento histórico desses anos pré-olímpicos finalizando, deste modo, o projeto RioOnWatch. Nós, então, construiremos o nosso próximo programa a partir do nosso aprendizado pré-olímpico: Políticas e programas nas favelas do Rio baseadas nas qualidades das favelas, e focadas na consolidação do potencial das favelas como veículos para o desenvolvimento urbano sustentável.</p>

Since 2010, over 20,000 favela families have been forcibly evicted from their homes to make way for Olympics projects. We have one year to go until the Olympic Games, and we need your help.



[ PORTUGUÊS ABAIXO OU AQUI ]


The Campaign

RioOnWatch has become the global go-to news portal for favela perspectives on the rapid transformations taking place in Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Olympics that are affecting their residents' livelihoods. With the intensity of change and our reputation only growing, urgent calls for support from Rio's favelas now come in throughout the day, every day. We must be ready to respond to these requests with real-time support, while growing the types of services we offer to take advantage of this unique window of opportunity. 
We were the first to publish about World Cup and Olympics evictions starting in 2010, and favela gentrification in 2011. We have since played an ever growing role introducing issues that place favelas in the center of numerous policy debates in Rio, from environmentally sustainable development to affordable housing.
""By channeling and maintaining a spotlight on them, since 2010 we have helped thousands of families in two dozen communities threatened with eviction keep their homes or receive better compensations.""
Over the next year, through August 2016, Rio de Janeiro will be in the global spotlight like it has never been before. Thousands of reporters will descend on the city, charged with producing stories. Many of them will be on Rio's favelas.
With this comes the opportunity to channel that spotlight in creative and productive ways, facilitating nuanced reporting that destigmatizes these misunderstood communities, often victims of lazy sensational journalism.
This is important because, as our work has shown, good reporting leads to policy changes and outright reversals, compensation increases for residents facing eviction, and dramatic community empowerment. Just as importantly, however, it sets the record straight on Rio's favelas in a way that paves the way for productive future policies.
""We happened upon something revolutionary. We’re taking hyper-local news from what were incredibly isolated, stigmatized and marginalized neighborhoods, and making them globally accessible... As a result outsiders' perceptions have changed, become more humane.""

With your help, if we're successful in this campaign, we can fully dedicate ourselves over the coming year, with no distractions, to:


Maintain RioOnWatch's momentum year-long, bringing the latest news from Rio's favelas to you.
Grow RioOnWatch with a network of new community correspondents and opinion leaders providing updates from across Rio's hard-to-reach zones.
Grow RioOnWatchTV and social video using Facebook, making favela assets and struggles globally visible and accessible.
Guarantee RioONWire as a public news resource, free of charge, providing hourly bite-sized Twitter updates on latest developments in Rio's favelas year-long.


Don't miss the full message from our Executive Director Theresa Williamson below for a complete description of why this campaign is important and what we'll do with your support.




Who We Are
Catalytic Communities (CatComm) is a 15-year-old community planning and advocacy nonprofit working on-the-ground across hundreds of Rio's favelas with local leaders and organizers. We have become known over the past 5 years for RioOnWatch, a news site and archive of Rio's pre-Olympic years and their impacts on Rio's favela communities, launched in May 2010.


What We Need
 We've worked hard to build CatComm as leanly as possible. Our projection for this coming year is that 76% of resources brought into the organization will be in-kind, thanks to contributions of time and talent by collaborators and volunteers. This leaves only $118,000 to raise to guarantee every single service and then some, that we want to deliver in support of Rio's favelas through the Olympics. 
Here's the breakdown (and feel free to contact us for more information!): 



As you can see we've specifically focused this campaign on the $78,240 needed to guarantee RioOnWatch, the Community Correspondents program and RioOnWatchTV. So if we're successful we'll be able to significantly expand the quality and coverage of favela community voices through the 2016 Olympic Games. If we exceed this goal, however, a number of other programs also become possible... RioONWire, our Twitter newswire, recently made public, will be maintained, and we'll:

Launch FavelaWire, a direct Twitter feed handled by dozens of favela organizers city-wide.
Provide journalists with a weekly update on the prior week's main headlines, next week's events, and story leads.
Link Olympics journalists with story leads by hundreds of favela organizers across Rio de Janeiro.
Publish regular Opinion pieces in major international outlets featuring the perspectives and vision we have come to represent on issues of housing, urban integration and community development.
Finally, if we go above and beyond and raise over $118,000, during June-August, 2016, we'll open up a physical hub for favela advocates, communicators, international journalists and Olympics visitors to hold networking events, exchanges, debates, meetings and presentations all aimed at shortening the distance between favela perspectives and the global community.
   





What You Get

In gratitude for your help, we'll shower you with gifts! 
Friends and collaborators have made a number of exciting *thank you!* perks available, from breathtaking prints of Rio's favelas to unique artwork, autographed books on Rio's Olympics, a weeklong stay with us in Rio, and a visit and lecture by our Executive Director at your event! 
Every single one of you will be thanked publicly on Twitter and recognized on our organization's website. If you have a personal or work project you'd like us to share, we'll mention it in our tweet! And we're happy to promote a project you're undertaking or excited about throughout the campaign so please let us know what it is. 
We're very excited about this campaign offering an opportunity to celebrate our passionate and talented network of collaborators and supporters, and bring us closer together as a community ensuring the equitable development of Rio's favelas, and communities worldwide. It's amazing what you all have helped us accomplish over these past 5 years! Let's see what we can do by coming together in this final year prior to the 2016 Games.





    Other Ways You Can Help We've set the minimum donation at $7 hoping this way everyone can participate. But we are counting on everyone to help in other ways, to reach our goal:  The most important thing you can do? Set a personal goal and get the word out to friends and family through personalized emails. 1st--Write down the email addresses of everyone you know - family, friends and colleagues - who you think may contribute. 2nd--Send them personalized, individual emails requesting they consider contributing to our campaign. 3rd--Mention your goal amount. People who click on a link to a campaign page from a direct, personalized email tend to contribute 25% more on average than other visitors. 
Are you part of any clubs or groups? Ask to make a short announcement at the end of your next meeting and tell people about our project. ""Hey, I'm doing this online fundraiser to support favela communities in the lead-up to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and I hope I can count on your help. Donations start at just $7. I've set a goal to raise X."" Again, people respond best to personal and face-to-face requests.
Make some social media noise about this campaign! We'll be posting resources you can use daily on Facebook here and Twitter here. Don't miss the amazing photos we've compiled from collaborators to use with this campaign. Please use the hashtags #FavelaOlympicsMediaPackage, #FundFavelaReporting and #EndFavelaStigma throughout the campaign. And feel free to take from the resources we'll be posting here:

Favela Facts


About CatComm




Full Message from Our Executive DirectorThe term 'favela' is often translated to English as slum, shantytown, squatter community, or even ghetto. With these deceptive translations come negative imagery around crime, violence and desperate poverty.But when I started working in Rio's favelas as a participatory urban planner in 2000, I came to appreciate a host of qualities in these communities and to realize these translations and depictions are not accurate, and they are incredibly damaging to these communities.A favela is simply a neighborhood that emerged from an unmet need for housing, where residents built their own environment, brick by brick, over generations. They are Rio's affordable housing stock and home to incredible cultural wealth and resilience. Though they began as squatter communities or slums, today Rio's favelas are almost universally consolidated and functional neighborhoods, housing nearly a quarter of Rio's population of 6 million. Because they were unregulated and developed organically, they are exceptionally diverse. Oftentimes producing overwhelming challenges, yes. But also producing intangible assets.Over nearly 120 years, Rio's favelas have evolved into consolidated neighborhoods that are core to the identity that makes Rio unique. What they need now is investment and participatory development.Catalytic Communities works to creatively integrate favelas into the city of Rio and make Rio's communities into worldwide examples of effective urban development. We believe the qualities of Rio's favelas can inspire communities everywhere.We work on one timely and unique project at a time, and put a lot of attention into the detail of our work. Trust in the communities we serve is our biggest asset and we have worked to cultivate this trust since 2000, building a network of thousands of favela organizers, leaders and journalists. Our first program, launched in 2001, was the world's first community solutions database for sharing favela solutions with the world, recognized by the Tech Museum in 2006. Our second major program was the Casa community technology hub, a community center in Rio's Port area that over 5 years supported 1200 local leaders from across Rio's favelas in digital training and networking. Our Casa was recognized as an 'actionable idea' for cities by the UN in 2006.But what we've become most known for is our work since 2010 through RioOnWatch - Rio Olympics Neighborhood Watch - our watchdog news site. When we saw our community network--and the assets of these communities--being affected by Olympics policies starting in 2010, we realized bringing these voices to the world stage would be critical. Since 2010 we have published nearly 1200 articles by community reporters and international observers, covering all aspects of Rio's urban development from favela perspectives. We were the first to publish about World Cup and Olympics evictions starting in 2010, and favela gentrification in 2011. We have increasingly played a role introducing issues and pushing the debate on Rio forward during this period. We've developed a rich collection of local knowledge with every turn of events documented. A critical tool for community organizers, journalists, researchers, urban planners and human rights advocates worldwide.We've also worked with hundreds of Brazilian and international journalists to improve the quality of media coverage of favelas, to reduce the stigma and raise awareness of these communities' qualities and what's at stake as favelas are forcibly evicted and as police incursions become a daily reality. We monitor media coverage of favelas on a daily basis, studying the changes in coverage of favelas since 2008 through next year's Olympics.And most importantly, through our coverage we've seen policy changes, reversals, compensation increases for residents, and dramatic community empowerment.This year we launched RioONWire, the world's first favela news wire. In its first 3 months we tweeted over 2000 times. Anyone in the world can now follow, in real time, bite-sized event updates and breaking news from Rio's favelas, in English, with background and context provided throughout the day. RioONWire was created to inform reporters arriving in Rio in the months leading up to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, so they have access to productive story topics and insight from Rio's favelas on deadline, but it is proving useful to groups ranging from housing organizers and human rights defenders to Rio residents and researchers.We happened upon something revolutionary. We're taking hyper-local news from what were incredibly isolated, stigmatized and marginalized neighborhoods, and making them globally accessible, by anyone with basic English and Web access. We organize and curate information so anyone arriving at it can follow specific communities, stories, policies or issues. As a result the perceptions of outsiders who come in contact with our work have changed, become more humane. If we can take advantage of this unique moment to expand our reach, providing nuance, fairness and accuracy in favela reporting, we'll reach a tipping point, and public perceptions will unequivocally switch, as will policies towards favelas.Now, we need your help. We get requests for support from Rio's favelas every single hour. And the speed and intensity is only growing through the 2016 Olympics and Paralympic Games.You've heard of the struggle that residents of Vila Autódromo have suffered. This is the long-standing favela next to the future Olympic Park. Most of Vila Autódromo's 600 families have now been evicted, but a hundred or so remain. If evicted, they will join the 20,000 families who have already been forcibly evicted in the lead-up to the Rio Olympics. They've become an international symbol of resistance in the face of enormous commercial pressure. Since 2009 RioOnWatch and our work with journalists has been key to tracking events unfolding here and making much of that visibility possible. We have documented this resistance and the city's policies towards the community step-by-step, making their case crystal clear to the international community and allowing reporters and researchers to follow the case.The next year will be the most important year ever for our work. We need to be able to respond to communities without the constant interruption of fundraising and remanaging what we can do to match budget shortfalls. We need to be able to reach our full potential during this critical period.""This last year before the start of the 2016 Olympic Games will be the most important ever for our work.""We have a unique window of opportunity through the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and we are asking for your help to realize our 'RioOnWatch Media Package'. The intense media activity surrounding Rio de Janeiro over this coming year will provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to set the record straight on Rio's favelas. If we are successful in our crowd funding campaign, we will:
Maintain RioOnWatch's momentum year-long, bringing the latest news from Rio's favelas to you.
Grow RioOnWatch with a network of new community correspondents and favela opinion leaders providing weekly updates from across Rio's hard-to-reach zones.
Grow RioOnWatchTV and social video using Facebook, making favela assets and struggles globally visible and accessible.
Guarantee RioONWire a public resource, free of charge, providing hourly updates on latest developments in Rio's favelas year-long.
We will also:
Launch FavelaWire, a direct Twitter feed handled by dozens of favela organizers city-wide.
Provide journalists with a weekly update on the prior week's main headlines, next week's events, and story leads.
Link Olympics journalists with story leads from hundreds of favela organizers across Rio de Janeiro.
Publish regular Opinion pieces in major international outlets featuring the perspectives and vision we have come to represent on issues of housing, urban integration and community development.

Open a physical hub for favela advocates, communicators, international journalists and Olympics visitors from June-August 2016 to hold networking events, exchanges, debates, meetings and presentations all aimed at shortening the distance between favela perspectives and the global community in the lead-up and during the 2016 Games.Catalytic Communities has become a trusted resource and connector for Brazilian and international journalists focused on Rio, and the opportunity for us to support quality story production will only grow in the coming year. We want to be able to meet this opportunity by providing all of these services, linking hyperlocal news to global audiences, over the coming year.We are asking you to help Catalytic Communities reach our fundraising goal of $78,240.  Only with your help can we guarantee Rio's favelas receive the attention and support they need through the 2016 Olympic Games.Should we be successful in this campaign, we will be freed up to focus 100% on our core support of favelas through August 2016. For example, if we reach our goal our annual Rio Raffle will not be necessary and an additional full month of our work will be freed up for our core activities. But since the mileage donations will still be available, as a thank you to all our supporters in any capacity this year, including volunteers, researchers, and yes--you, all participants in this campaign--come December 31st we will choose one person at random to visit us, with a friend, in Rio next year.And if you're wondering what we've got planned for after the Olympics? Well, when the Olympics and Paralympics are over, we will complete and publish our longitudinal Media Analysis report of global coverage of Rio's favelas since 2008, as well as conduct our final Favela Perceptions Survey, looking at how impressions of favelas have changed, worldwide, since 2010. Our Media Package will be complete with a ""RioOnWatch Replication Manual"" that citizen groups around the world can use to replicate our efforts in their towns over years to come. And we plan to publish RioOnWatch in photo book form and retire RioOnWatch as a historical document of these pre-Olympic years. We will then build our next program on the back of these pre-Olympics achievements: policies and programs in Rio's favelas that are asset-based and focused on consolidating favelas' potential as vehicles for sustainable urban development.




Thank you for your support!

RioOnWatch: Pacote de Mídias em Prol das Favelas no Ano Pré-Olímpico

Garanta que as favelas do Rio recebam a atenção e o suporte que precisam até os Jogos Olímpicos de 2016
[caso não queira navegar em inglês, faça sua doação pelo PayPal em português aqui]

Desde 2010, mais de 20.000 famílias de favelas foram removidas de suas casas para dar lugar a obras Olímpicas. Temos um ano até as Olimpíadas, e precisamos da sua ajuda.
A Campanha


O RioOnWatch se tornou o principal portal de notícias internacional para acompanhar os pontos de vista de moradores das favelas sobre as rápidas transformações que vem ocorrendo no Rio de Janeiro, em decorrência dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016. Com a intensidade das mudanças e nossa crescente visibilidade, chamadas urgentes para apoiar favelas do Rio agora nos chegam todos os dias. Nós devemos estar prontos para responder a esses chamados dando suporte em tempo real e ao mesmo tempo podendo expandir os tipos de serviço de comunicação que oferecemos para aproveitar a oportunidade desta janela de destaque única que temos até os Jogos. 
Nós fomos os primeiros a publicar sobre as remoções para a Copa do Mundo e as Olimpíadas, que começaram em 2010, e sobre a gentrificação das favelas em 2011. Desde então, nós temos desempenhado um papel cada vez maior na introdução de questões que colocam as favelas no centro de inúmeros debates políticos no Rio, desde desenvolvimento desenvolvimento sustentável até habitação a preços acessíveis.
“Ao canalizar e manter o foco sobre elas, desde 2010 nós ajudamos milhares de famílias em várias comunidades ameaçadas de remoção, a manterem suas casas e receberem melhores compensações.” 
Ao longo do próximo ano, até agosto de 2016, o Rio vai estar sob o holofote global como nunca esteve antes. Milhares de repórteres desembarcarão na cidade, encarregados de produzir notícias. Muitas delas serão sobre as favelas do Rio. 
A partir disso, teremos a oportunidade de canalizar toda essa atenção de forma criativa e produtiva, facilitando reportagens diferenciadas com maior nuance, perspectivas de moradores, e que sirvam para desestigmatizar as comunidades cariocas, tradicionalmente vítimas do jornalismo sensacionalista e preguiçoso.
Isto é importante. Como o nosso trabalho tem demonstrado, boas reportagens levam a mudanças e até reversõess de política, aumentos nas indenizações para moradores vítimas de remoções, e um grau de empoderamento comunitário expressivo. Tão importante quanto isso, no entanto, é um garantir um registro clarificador sobre as favelas do Rio de Janeiro de forma a ser capaz de abrir o caminho para políticas futuras produtivas. 
""Nós estamos fazendo acontecer algo revolucionário. Estamos trazendo a público notícias hiper-locais advindas de regiões que eram altamente isoladas, estigmatizadas e marginalizadas, e tornando-as acessíveis globalmente… Como resultado as percepções de pessoas de fora estão mudando, se tornando mais humanas...""
Com sua ajuda, se formos bem sucedidos nessa campanha, poderemos nos dedicar completamente ao longo do próximo ano, sem distrações, a: 

Manter o ímpeto do RioOnWatch ao longo do ano, trazendo as últimas notícias de favelas do Rio para você.
Expandir o RioOnWatch com uma rede de novos correspondentes comunitários e publicar opiniões de formadores de opinião das favelas cariocas, fornecendo atualizações semanais de zonas de difícil alcance do Rio de Janeiro.
Expandir o RioOnWatchTV e vídeos sociais usando o Facebook, tornando as qualidades das favela e suas lutas globalmente visíveis e acessíveis.
Garantir o RioOnWire como uma fonte de noticias pública, gratuita, fornecendo atualizações de hora em hora no Twitter sobre os últimos acontecimentos nas favelas do Rio ao longo do ano.

Não deixe de ler, abaixo, a mensagem da nossa Diretora Executiva, Theresa Williamson, com a descrição completa sobre as razões dessa campanha ser tão importante e também sobre o que faremos com seu apoio. 

Quem somos
A Comunidades Catalisadoras (ComCat) é uma organização sem fins lucrativos, existente há 15 anos, de planejamento comunitário e advocacy trabalhando localmente com centenas de favelas do Rio junto à líderes e mobilizadores locais. Nós nos tornamos conhecidos nos últimos 5 anos devido ao RioOnWatch, um site de noticias e arquivo dos registros dos anos pré-olímpicos do Rio e seus impactos nas comunidades do Rio, lançado em maio de 2010. 


O que nós precisamos
Temos nos esforçado para construir a ComCat da forma mais enxuta possível. Nossa projeção para o próximo ano é que 76% dos recursos trazidos à organização serão em espécie, graças às contribuições de tempo e talento de centenas de colaboradores e voluntários. Por isso, precisamos arrecadar apenas R$380.343,00 para garantir cada um destes serviços, e também lançar mais alguns novos serviços oportunos às favelas do Rio até as Olimpíadas. 
Aqui está a divisão dos custos (e sinta-se livre de nos contatar para mais informação!): 



Como se vê, com esta campanha, especificamente, concentramos nos US$78.240 necessários para garantir o RioOnWatch, o programa de Correspondentes Comunitários e o RioOnWatchTV. Com isso, se formos bem sucedidos, vamos ser capazes de expandir significativamente a qualidade e a cobertura das vozes das favelas até os Jogos Olímpicos de 2016. Se exceder esse objetivo, no entanto, uma série de outros programas também se tornarão possíveis... RioONWire, nosso noticiário no Twitter, recentemente tornado público, poderá ser mantido, e nós iremos:

Lançar o FavelaWire, uma fonte de notícias no Twitter diretamente gerenciada por uma grande rede de mobilizadores de favelas por toda a cidade.
Fornecer a jornalistas um resumo semanal sobre as principais manchetes da semana anterior, eventos da próxima semana e pautas para notícias pedidas por mobilizadores locais.
Conectar jornalistas olímpicos com pautas trazidas por centenas de mobilizadores das favelas do Rio de Janeiro.
Publicar artigos de opinião, regularmente, em meios de comunicação internacionais de grande alcance, onde constarão as perspectivas e a visão que nós representamos em termos de assuntos como o direito à moradia, integração urbanística e desenvolvimento comunitário.
Finalmente, se nós superarmos a meta e arrecadarmos mais de $118.000, durante junho-agosto de 2016, nós abriremos um espaço físico para mobilizadores de favela, comunicadores, jornalistas internacionais e visitantes dos Jogos Olímpicos para a criação de redes de contato, intercâmbios, debates, reuniões e apresentações, todas destinadas a encurtar a distância entre as perspectivas da favela e a comunidade global.


O que você recebe
Como forma de agradecimento por sua ajuda, haverá uma chuva de brindes!  
Amigos e colaboradores disponibilizaram vários brindes de agradecimento incríveis, desde fotos das favelas do Rio de tirar o fôlego até obras de arte únicas, livros sobre as Olimpíadas autografados, estadia de uma semana no Rio, uma visita a uma favela com a nossa equipe e até uma palestra de nossa Diretora Executiva em seu evento.
Cada um de vocês será agradecido publicamente no Twitter e reconhecido no nosso site. Se você tem um projeto pessoal ou profissional que queira compartilhar, nós o mencionaremos em nosso Twitter. E ficaremos felizes em promover um projeto em que você esteja envolvido ou entusiasmado por intermédio de nossa campanha, então por favor nos conte sobre ele.
Nós estamos muito empolgados com o fato dessa campanha estar oferecendo uma oportunidade de celebrar a nossa rede de colaboradores e apoiadores apaixonados e talentosos, e nos unir como uma comunidade que assegura o desenvolvimento igualitário das favelas do Rio e de outras comunidades por todo o mundo. É incrível o que vocês todos nos ajudaram a conquistar ao longo desses 5 anos de RioOnWatch! Vamos ver o que podemos fazer nos unindo nesse último ano antes das Olimpíadas de 2016. 

Outras formas de ajudar 
Nós estabelecemos a doação mínima de US$7 (R$24) com esperança de que, dessa forma, todos possam participar. Mas, para atingir nosso objetivo, o mais importante é a divulgação:

Qual é a coisa mais importante que você pode fazer? Estabelecer um objetivo pessoal e espalhar a novidade para seus amigos e familiares através de emails personalizados: 1. Escreva os endereços de email de todos que você conhece--familiares, amigos e colegas--que você acha que podem contribuir. 2. Envie-os emails personalizados e individuais perguntando se eles consideram a possibilidade de contribuir com a nossa campanha. 3. Mencione sua meta. Pessoas que clicam no link da página de uma campanha de um email direto e personalizado tendem, em média, a contribuir 25% mais do que outros visitantes. E ainda mais quando sabem que ajudarão a um amigo a atingir uma meta pessoal.
Você faz parte de algum clube ou grupo? Pergunte se você pode fazer um comunicado curto no final da próxima reunião e falar com as pessoas sobre o projeto. ""Olá, estou participando de uma arrecadação de fundos online, para ajudar as comunidades das favelas nos Jogos Olímpicos e Paraolímpicos, e eu espero contar com a sua ajuda. O mínimo para doar é de US$7 ou R$24. Eu estabeleci a meta de arrecadar “X"". Mais uma vez, as pessoas respondem melhor à pedidos individuais ou feitos pessoalmente. 
Faça barulho sobre a campanha nas redes sociais! Nós postaremos diariamente recursos que você pode usar, no Facebook aqui e no Twitter aqui. Não deixe de a compilação de fotos incríveis doadas por nossos colaboradores, para esta campanha.

Mensagem completa de nossa Diretora Executiva
O termo ""favela"" é traduzido como 'slum' (bairro sórdido), 'shantytown' (vila de barracos), 'squatter community’ (comunidade de invasores) ou mesmo 'gueto'. Estes termos evocam imagens negativas relativas a crime, violência e pobreza.
Porém, quando eu comecei a trabalhar em favelas do Rio de Janeiro como planejadora urbana participativa, em 2000, eu comecei a apreciar uma série de qualidades nestas comunidades e percebi que essas traduções e representações não são precisas, e são incrivelmente prejudiciais para as comunidades.
Uma favela é simplesmente um bairro que surgiu a partir de uma necessidade não atendida de habitação, onde os moradores construíram seu próprio ambiente, tijolo por tijolo, ao longo de gerações. Elas atendem a demanda por moradias a preços acessíveis no Rio e abrigam uma incrível riqueza cultural e resiliência. Embora elas começaram como comunidades precárias de posseiros, as favelas do Rio hoje são quase universalmente vizinhanças consolidadas e funcionais, que abrigam quase um quarto da população do Rio de 6 milhões. Devido ao fato destas comunidades não serem regulamentadas, elas foram desenvolvidas organicamente, e por isso são excepcionalmente diversas. Muitas vezes produzindo desafios esmagadores, sim. Mas também produzindo ativos intangíveis. 
Ao longo de quase 120 anos, as favelas do Rio evoluíram para vizinhanças consolidadas que são fundamentais para a identidade que faz do Rio uma cidade única. O que precisamos agora é de investimento e desenvolvimento participativo.
A Comunidades Catalisadoras trabalha para integrar criativamente favelas na cidade do Rio e tornar as comunidades do Rio de Janeiro exemplos mundiais de desenvolvimento urbano eficaz. Acreditamos que as qualidades das favelas do Rio podem inspirar comunidades em todo o mundo.
Nós trabalhamos em um projeto pontual e único de cada vez, e colocamos toda atenção em cada detalhe do nosso trabalho. A confiança das comunidades que servimos é o nosso maior trunfo e temos trabalhado para cultivar essa confiança desde 2000, através da construção de uma rede de milhares de organizadores, lideranças e comunicadores comunitários. Nosso primeiro programa, lançado em 2001, foi o primeiro banco de dados aberto de soluções comunitárias para a partilha de soluções de favela com o mundo, reconhecido pelo Tech Museum em 2006. Nosso segundo grande programa foi o telecentro Casa do Gestor Catalisador, um centro comunitário na região portuária do Rio que por 5 anos apoiou 1.200 mobilizadores locais de favelas em todo o Rio com treinamento digital, espaços de troca e redes de apoio. Nossa Casa foi reconhecida como uma ""idéia acionável” para as cidades pelas Nações Unidas em 2006.
Mas o que nos tornou mais conhecido foi o nosso trabalho, desde 2010, através do RioOnWatch—Rio Olympics Neighborhood Watch—nosso site de relatos das favelas, traduzido para o português como ‘Comunidades do Rio de Olho nas Olimpíadas”. A partir de 2010, quando vimos nossa rede comunitária—e as qualidades dessas comunidades—sendo negativamente afetadas pelas políticas de preparo para os Jogos Olímpicos, percebemos que trazer essas vozes para o palco mundial seria crucial. Desde 2010 temos publicado cerca de 1200 artigos de jornalistas comunitários e observadores internacionais, abrangendo todos os aspectos do desenvolvimento urbano do Rio sob a ótica de moradores das favelas.
Nós fomos os primeiros a publicar sobre as remoções, devido a Copa do Mundo e Jogos Olímpicos a partir de 2010, e a introduzir o conceito de gentrificação das favelas a partir de 2011. Temos atuado cada vez mais no papel de introduzir questões e levar adiante o debate sobre o Rio durante este período. Nós desenvolvemos um rico acervo de conhecimento local com todas as etapas dos eventos documentadas. Uma ferramenta crucial para mobilizadores comunitários, jornalistas, pesquisadores, urbanistas e defensores dos direitos humanos em todo o mundo.
Também temos trabalhado com centenas de jornalistas brasileiros e internacionais para melhorar a qualidade da cobertura da grande mídia sobre as favelas, para reduzir o estigma e aumentar a consciência das qualidades dessas comunidades que estão em risco, dado que favelas estão sendo removidas e ocupações policiais se tornaram uma realidade diária. Nós monitoramos a cobertura da grande mídia global sobre as favelas diariamente, estudando as mudanças na cobertura de favelas desde 2008 em função dos Jogos Olímpicos.
E o mais importante, através da nossa cobertura vimos mudanças e reversões políticas, aumentos de indenizações para moradores vítimas de remoçõess, e empoderamento expressivo da comunidade.
Este ano lançamos o RioONWire, a primeira fonte de micro-notícias dinâmica de favela do mundo no Twitter. Em seus primeiros 3 meses, tuitamos mais de 2000 vezes. Qualquer pessoa no mundo pode agora acompanhar, em tempo real, atualizações de eventos e notícias ao vivo das favelas do Rio de Janeiro, em inglês, com histórico e contexto fornecido durante todo o dia. O RioONWire foi criado para informar aos repórteres que chegarão ao Rio nos meses que antecedem os Jogos Olímpicos e Paraolímpicos, para que eles tenham acesso a tópicos e notícias produtivos e uma percepção mais apurada sobre as favelas do Rio de Janeiro, sem desculpa de prazos estipulados por seus editores impedindo uma apuração cautelosa. Mas o RioONWire já está se provando útil para diversos grupos, desde técnicos de habitação, à defensores de direitos humanos, cidadãos cariocas e pesquisadores.
Nós estamos fazendo acontecer algo revolucionário. Estamos trazendo a público notícias hiper-locais advindas de regiões que eram altamente isoladas, estigmatizadas e marginalizadas, e tornando-as acessíveis globalmente, para qualquer pessoa com inglês básico e acesso à internet. Nós organizamos e gerimos as informações de modo que qualquer pessoa possa seguir comunidades, histórias, políticas ou questões específicas. Como resultado as percepções de pessoas de fora estão mudando, se tornando mais humanas.
Se pudermos aproveitar este momento único para expandir nosso alcance, proporcionar nuance e uma visão justa e precisa nas reportagens sobre favelas, nós vamos chegar a um ponto crítico de conscientização, e as percepções públicas irão mudar de vez, assim como as políticas em prol das favelas.
Agora, nós precisamos da sua ajuda. Recebemos pedidos de apoio de moradores de favela do Rio a cada hora. E a velocidade e a intensidade só irá aumentar com a proximidade das Olimpíadas de 2016 e dos Jogos Paraolímpicos.
Você já ouviu falar da luta que os moradores da Vila Autódromo enfrentam. Esta é uma favela de longa data ao lado do futuro Parque Olímpico. A maioria das 600 famílias da Vila Autódromo já foram removidas, mas mais de uma centena permanece. Eles estão entre as dezenas de milhares de famílias que estão sendo removidas para os preparativos dos Jogos Olímpicos no Rio. Eles se tornaram um símbolo internacional de resistência em face da enorme pressão comercial. Desde 2009 o RioOnWatch e nosso trabalho com jornalistas têm sido fundamental para rastrear os desdobramentos dos eventos no local e gerar a maior visibilidade possível. Nós documentamos essa resistência e as políticas da Prefeitura para com a comunidade passo-a-passo, tornando o caso cristalino para a comunidade internacional, tornando acessível aos jornalistas e pesquisadores o acompanhamento do caso.
O próximo ano será o ano mais importante até agora para o nosso trabalho. Temos de ser capazes de responder a comunidades sem a interrupção constante de captação de recursos e remanejamento que fazemos para corresponder déficits orçamentários. Precisamos ser capazes de alcançar nosso pleno potencial durante este período crítico.
""Este último ano, antes do início dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016, será o mais importante até agora para o nosso trabalho.""
Temos uma única brecha muito oportuna através dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016 e nós estamos pedindo sua ajuda para realizar o nosso 'Pacote de Mídia RioOnWatch’'. A intensa atividade midiática abarcando o Rio ao longo do próximo ano poderá proporcionar uma oportunidade única para redefinirmos, de forma justa, a imagem das favelas do Rio.
Se formos bem sucedidos em nossa campanha, iremos:

Manter o ímpeto do RioOnWatch ao longo do ano, trazendo as últimas notícias de favelas do Rio para você.
Expandir o RioOnWatch com uma rede de novos correspondentes comunitários e publicando opiniões de formadores de opinião das favelas cariocas, fornecendo atualizações semanais de zonas de difícil alcance do Rio de Janeiro.
Expandir o RioOnWatchTV e vídeos sociais usando o Facebook, tornando as qualidades das favela e suas lutas globalmente visíveis e acessíveis.
Garantir que o RioOnWire seja uma fonte de noticias pública, gratuita, fornecendo atualizações de hora em hora no Twitter sobre os últimos acontecimentos nas favelas do Rio ao longo do ano.

Nós também iremos:

Lançar o FavelaWire, uma fonte de notícias no Twitter diretamente gerenciada por uma grande rede de mobilizadores de favelas por toda a cidade.
Fornecer a jornalistas uma atualização semanal sobre as principais manchetes da semana anterior, eventos da próxima semana e pautas para notícias pedidas por mobilizadores locais.
Conectar jornalistas olímpicos com pautas trazidas por centenas de mobilizadores das favelas do Rio de Janeiro.
Publicar artigos de opinião regularmente, em meios de comunicação internacionais de grande alcance, onde constarão as perspectivas e a visão que nós representamos em termos de assuntos como o direito à moradia, integração urbanística e desenvolvimento comunitário.
Inaugurar um espaço físico para mobilizadores de favela, comunicadores, jornalistas internacionais e visitantes dos Jogos Olímpicos para a criação de redes de contato, intercâmbios, debates, reuniões e apresentações, todas destinadas a encurtar a distância entre as perspectivas da favela e a comunidade global.

A Comunidades Catalisadoras tem se tornado um recurso confiável e um conector para mobilizadores locais com jornalistas brasileiros e internacionais focados no Rio, e a oportunidade para apoiarmos a produção de matérias de qualidade só irá aumentar ao longo do próximo ano. Nós queremos ser capazes de atender a essa oportunidade, fornecendo todos esses serviços, ligando notícias hiper-locais com o público global, neste período.
Nós estamos pedindo a sua ajuda para que a Comunidades Catalisadoras alcance o seu objetivo de captação de US$78.240. Só com a sua ajuda é que poderemos garantir que as favelas do Rio recebam a atenção e apoio necessário até os Jogos Olímpicos de 2016.
Caso sejamos bem sucedidos com esta campanha, estaremos aptos para nos concentrarmos 100% em nosso apoio total às favelas até agosto de 2016. Isso também quer dizer que se formos bem sucedidos nossa Rio Rifa anual não será necessária e um mês inteiro adicional de nosso trabalho normalmente gasto com a rifa, será liberado para as nossas atividades principais. Mas dado que a doação de milhas e hospedagem para a rifa terá sido feita, como um agradecimento a todos os nossos apoiadores, a qualquer título este ano, incluindo voluntários, pesquisadores e sim—você e todos os participantes nesta campanha—no próximo 31 de dezembro, vamos sortear uma pessoa para visitar-nos, com direito a um acompanhante, no Rio no próximo ano.
E se você está se perguntando o que temos planejado para depois dos Jogos Olímpicos? Bem, quando os Jogos Olímpicos e Paraolímpicos terminarem, vamos concluir e publicar a nossa pesquisa de análise de cobertura midiática global longitudinal (não temos está página em português) sobre as favelas do Rio de Janeiro desde 2008, bem como conduzir nossa pesquisa final sobre a mudança nas percepções das favelas, observando como as impressões sobre as favelas mudaram, a nível mundial, desde 2010. Nosso pacote de mídia será concluído com um ""Manual de Replicação do RioOnWatch"", do qual grupos de cidadãos de todo o mundo poderão usar para replicar nossos esforços em suas cidades ao longo dos anos vindouros. E nós planejamos publicar o RioOnWatch em forma de um livro ilustrado transformando o RioOnWatch em um documento histórico desses anos pré-olímpicos finalizando, deste modo, o projeto RioOnWatch. Nós, então, construiremos o nosso próximo programa a partir do nosso aprendizado pré-olímpico: Políticas e programas nas favelas do Rio baseadas nas qualidades das favelas, e focadas na consolidação do potencial das favelas como veículos para o desenvolvimento urbano sustentável.

<p></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>My name is Ella, I am a 2nd grader in Boise, ID and I would like to ask for your help with
my mission of placing a homeless family into a home.

<p>This last winter, while driving to school, I noticed a
stroller among the belongings of a homeless individual. It was a very cold
morning and the thought of a small child not having a warm safe place to take
shelter in and call home really struck me. After driving by the same area several
days in a row, I decided I needed to do something to help. I created a flyer
during free time in school and began asking my classmates to help me gather
money to buy the homeless child a house. I quickly learned that perhaps there
were better ways to help displaced families, which made more sense and were
more attainable than purchasing a house. After returning the money I had
collected from a couple of students, I asked for help from my mother to find
the resources to pursue my dream.</p>
<p>I discovered the CATCH program in Boise. CATCH (Charitable Assistance To Community’s Homeless), is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization committed to re-housing and serving homeless families with children. My mother and I met with the
director of CATCH and discussed the many ways that we can help the homeless
community as individuals. After the meeting with CATCH, I have decided to

</div></div>","IntroductionMy name is Ella, I am a 2nd grader in Boise, ID and I would like to ask for your help with
my mission of placing a homeless family into a home.

This last winter, while driving to school, I noticed a
stroller among the belongings of a homeless individual. It was a very cold
morning and the thought of a small child not having a warm safe place to take
shelter in and call home really struck me. After driving by the same area several
days in a row, I decided I needed to do something to help. I created a flyer
during free time in school and began asking my classmates to help me gather
money to buy the homeless child a house. I quickly learned that perhaps there
were better ways to help displaced families, which made more sense and were
more attainable than purchasing a house. After returning the money I had
collected from a couple of students, I asked for help from my mother to find
the resources to pursue my dream.
I discovered the CATCH program in Boise. CATCH (Charitable Assistance To Community’s Homeless), is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization committed to re-housing and serving homeless families with children. My mother and I met with the
director of CATCH and discussed the many ways that we can help the homeless
community as individuals. After the meeting with CATCH, I have decided to
resume my efforts to make a home possible for a family that has no place to go.
I have decided to make it my mission to raise $3,900 for the
CATCH program which pays for a family with children to be rent-free for six
months while working with the CATCH staff to address the root causes of their
homelessness. The CATCH program places approximately 100 families a year, and
they currently have an extensive wait-list that is 8 months out.
I need your help. I have
started the donations by putting in the money that I collected from Easter eggs
this last holiday, please join me in my grassroots attempt to help the
community and take one more family off of the streets.
   How you can help Every dollar counts. I am starting off the campaign by donating money that I saved from and Easter egg hunt, others are contributing spare change. As I mentioned above, my mother and I are working to find businesses in the community to match donations, we will keep you updated on this process.   The Impact By raising the targeted amount, we will be able to take one more family off the CATCH program wait-list. With only $3,900, CATCH will be able to assist a family with placement into a safe home, and support them for 6 months with rental assistance, and extensive case management to address the root causes of the family's homelessness.
The families that CATCH serves have experienced a series of hard blows that have put them in a position of helplessness, homelessness, and hopelessness. We all know that when it rains it pours, but when it starts pouring and you have no where to go, the hits can be devastating, traumatizing, and even life threatening. After taking hit after hit, these families are in desperate need of a break, one chance to be able to change the momentum of their lives and move toward a safe, stable and nourishing environment for everyone to grow in. We all deserve that chance, and CATCH can give one more family that chance, with our help.

</p>
<p>Current wind energy designs are flawed. My invention, the
McCanney Wing Generator, efficiently captures wind energy unlike any wind
generator on the market today. By efficiently capturing wind energy, the
McCanney Wing Generator has the potential to make wind energy production the
most cost efficient energy production method in the world.  And it works 24 hours a day in all parts of the world ... day and night come rain or come shine.<br/></p>
<p>Most green advocates do not understand that ""alternative energy"" as implemented today is in the best interests of BIG CENTRALIZED ENERGY.  It guarantees that we will NEVER be able to replace gasoline alcohol autos with purely electrical vehicles.  Simply put .. the electrical companies cannot produce and deliver enough electrical energy to replace gasoline.  SO WE ARE STUCK ... RIGHT ? ... WRONG !<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Let’s face it, the problem with green energy is that it
costs more to produce than coal and nuclear power. Worse yet, power companies
don’t have a strong incentive to produce power using renewable energy sources. The
world needs a green energy solution that is cheaper than traditional power.</p>
<p>Based on preliminary calculations, the McCanney Wing
Generator will produce energy more efficiently than coal or nuclear power
production, not to mention the environmental solution. By increasing the number of blades, utilizing large surface airfoil WINGs that work in the direction of rotation, by reducing weight and gearing
the turbine to turn very slowly, the McCanney Wing Generator efficiently
captures wind energy from the entire area of its blades. Because the McCanney
Wing Generator captures more wind, it is able to produce more energy. It is
that simple! We are committed to making wind energy a total energy source. Additionally, because it spins slowly, it can scale up to extremely
large sizes and power ratings comparable to those of nuclear and coal fired
power plants.  <br/></p>
<p>The McCanney Wing Generator has several applications.  The 12 Meter
generators will be used to directly power ranches, large farms, factories and small communities such as eco-villages. Larger
generators will be used to power towns and cities. Even larger generators will someday replace nuclear power plants! They can be used to directly pump water, run desalinization plants, power ocean going vessels or compress air storage without conversion to electricity.  The scope and application of this technology
is seemingly limitless. </p>
<p>Please donate today to help the McCanney Wing Generator get off
the ground. If everyone who visited this page gave $20, we would reach our
goal! Your donation will directly fund the final prototype and commercialization on a large scale.  Developer Licenses are also available in the options below for individuals and corporations. <br/></p>
<p>My name is James M. McCanney, M.S. Physics and I have developed a new highly efficient WING energy system that is scalable to extremely large sizes.  I use the term WING instead of wind to separate it from the low energy systems that people normally associate with alternative wind energy.  My quest started long ago as I was contracted by energy companies to do an end to end analysis of their power distribution efficiencies and losses.  They also included a request for analysis of the upcoming ""alternative energy"" industry.  What I discovered horrified me.  None of the alternative energy solutions would ever solve the world's energy needs.  They were being built and marketed by the same companies that had large financial interests in COAL NUCLEAR AND BIG OIL.  These were only meant to stay off the Greenies ... the tree huggers ... into thinking there would be a future when in reality they would never replace the central big three energy sources.  Burning high energy content fuels was here to stay ... forever. <br/></p>
<p>So i started designing from the bottom up.  I analyzed solar and wind and discovered that WIND is the only true source for world energy complete independence (solar will only be a partial band aid).  For every location on the planet at all times of day and night and all year long.  I then started to write what is known in engineering circles as a ""Functional Specification"".  This is a set of design parameters that the final design must meet and also included all the bad things about current designs that had to be eliminated in my new design.  My WING system is the result of years of behind the scenes theoretical analysis and testing.  This resulted in my publication of this and related material in my September 2014 released eBook ""McCanney WING GENERATOR - WORLD ENERGY PROJECT"" (front and rear cover at the bottom of this page) which you will receive as a bonus for any donations over $100 to this campaign. </p>
<p>I use the term <i><b>""WING GENERATOR"" </b></i> to distinguish from past generation ""wind generators"".  I have also coined the term <i><b>""REPLACEMENT ENERGY"" </b></i> instead of ""alternative energy"" because my system will REPLACE centralized power and allow people to cut the cord whereas alternative energy is just that ... an add on band aid that will never solve the world energy problem.<br/></p>
<p>Wind is the most abundant and available energy source on earth.  It blows day and night in all places of the globe.  Come rain or come shine or night time and even at the north and south poles ... the wind keeps blowing.  The large 1000 foot engineering designs have been simulated and tested by a world class engineering company.  The diagram below shows the scaled WING systems from 100' tall ... to the 1000' tall design capable of replacing two 500 MegaWatt nuclear power plants.  <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433440464/hzfiabydb8jifxje0khf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>But we have to walk before we can run.  The current crowd funding project is to build and bring to market what I call the ""12 meter WING GENERATOR"" (39 foot diameter model) capable of powering a small village, a large ranch or major farm ... or any remote facility.   We have MANY targeted locations around the globe who will purchase these today.  The 12 METER model has been carefully chosen to meet the widest market segment world-wide.<br/><h3>if you are in a hurry scroll up to contribute --&gt; <br/>
</h3>
<h3>if not continue reading for a few minutes more !<br/>
</h3>
<p>RELIABILITY - The design is very simple with NO MOVING PARTS except for bearings (the same principle that makes jet engines so reliable). </p>
<p>LONGEVITY - This system is designed for the long term.  Unlike old generation 3 blade wind generators which are constantly breaking down these systems are designed to be running in 100 or 200 years with minimal maintenance.<br/></p>
<p>SIMPLICITY - Unlike prior generation wind generators, the WING system has all assembly, maintenance and heavy equipment ON THE GROUND.  <br/></p>
<p>EFFICIENCY - The WING systems work efficiently AT LOW WIND SPEEDS unlike predecessors which only run at 10% efficiency even at mid wind speeds.  The WING systems are designed to extract energy at all wind speeds ... they do not need a separate motor to get them started and they operate at high wind speeds without any vibration.</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY - The design principle is that they move very slowly and therefore do not kill bats or birds.  They do not generate any high frequency noise. They are pleasing to the eye.  They are Eco-Friendly.  Your electric car is not ""eco-friendly"" if your electric source is coal or nuclear power.  WING powered compressed air and electric vehicles will bring in a new age of ecologically sound transportation. <br/></p>
<p>LIGHT WEIGHT - The WING designs incorporate extremely strong light weight materials.  The large units weigh less than a single blade of a moderate sized 3 blade wind generator. <br/></p>
<p>WORLD ENERGY SOLUTION - MOST OF ALL the larger systems will one day replace coal nuclear and hydrocarbon based fuels completely.  We can generate ALL ,... that's right ... 100% of our energy from one single source ... the wind ... but we will never do it with solar or the old 3 blade wind generators which have proven themselves to be a complete disaster.  At a generous 20% of stated power with the old 3 blade wind generators (1.5 MegaWatt towers) it would take 77,000,000 of them to approach our world energy needs.  Clearly that will never happen.  With just 3000 of my 1000' WING generators world wide we would replace ALL nuclear coal and oil  power sources including running electric trains buses and automobiles ... and at a cost both monetarily AND environmentally far far less than coal nuclear hydrocarbon based and even hydro based energy.  Two single large WING generators would produce the energy of the Hoover Dam and at far less cost (by the way the Hoover Dam is not producing any electricity at all now due to the California drought ... but the wind is still blowing like crazy there). <br/></p>
<p>THE 12 METER WING GENERATOR - When you contribute to this fund you will be helping launch the first commercial WING product ... the 12 METER WING GENERATOR that will fulfill the market of remote towns or small island communities OR large ranches or farms of which there are 100s of thousands around the world.  So hopefully you can see the market potential.  These communities will then be able to ""cut the cord"" to the centralized power companies.  These are the communities who pay the most for electric service.  Are you starting to get the picture ???  Can you imagine how this will grow when you start seeing these remote communities operating pure electric cars and motor scooters on WING power, eliminating their dependency on imported hydrocarbon fuels?  This is going to happen.  Are you going to help? <br/></p>
<p>WHAT WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION DO ??? It will help me buy better materials and make a better product and produce more testing.  It will help reach out to more communities in our awareness and marketing and bring the 12 METER model to the world.  I WANT YOUR HELP ... NOT FOR ME ... FOR THE WORLD WHICH IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF A TRUE 100% ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOLUTION.<br/></p>
<p>HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE ... I am asking EVERYONE to contribute at least $20 ... more if you can ... but EVERYONE please make a donation ... my goal is to completely replace ALL COAL NUCLEAR OIL based fuels and be completely WING independent ... I have a plan to do this ... your contribution will go to pure R&amp;D and the end product.<br/></p>

<p>The goal of this campaign is simple: to ensure that Tacoma 
government more equally reflects its population. The chance to be 
equally represented relies on putting forward candidates who understand 
the community's needs at all levels. While it's fair to say that 
political races are weighted in favor of those with the most funds, I 
was shocked that a city with a population of over 200,000 citizens could
 have any electoral campaign where candidates run unopposed. Even the 
basic filing fees for office (before taking into consideration the costs
 of a typical campaign) limit who runs for public office to those with 
access to economic power. If key segments of our population are unable 
to participate in the elections as candidates, there is very little 
chance for fair representation.  </p>

residents live below the poverty level

makers who approve fines or rate increases for basic services typically 
do not see the impact first-hand of what happens to those unable to pay;
 how law-abiding citizens can be made criminal just in the process of 
trying to survive on less than living wages.  </p>

<p>How
 do we create a city government that meets the needs of those without a 
voice? We need to work to remove barriers to participation in public 
life. We need public transportation that meets the needs of low-income 
workers (who are often forced to work shifts which do not align with 
public services), sick leave and protections for pregnant workers, 
effective measures to stop discrimination, and initiatives to improve 
educational resources across the city. We need to stop punishing those 
with the least resources by sending unpaid court fees to private 
collections agencies, and create realistic ways that offenders can pay 
off their debts. We need to protect the environment for those who can 
least afford the health risks associated with pollution. And we need to 
level the political playing field. This means that elections should 
better represent our community. </p>

<p>          When <b>Bob Woodruff</b>, ABC’s newly appointed news anchor, was hit by a roadside bomb while covering the war in Iraq, his life changed in an instant.  Bob’s traumatic brain injury nearly killed him.  But his miraculous recovery, including surviving 36 days in a coma, inspired the creation of the<b> Bob Woodruff Foundation</b>. </p>
<p>          The BWF is a non-profit charity that is  dedicated to ensuring injured service members and their families will have access to the highest levels of support and resources they deserve, for so long as they need it.   In short, the BWF wants to do its best to see that the wounded will thrive long after our they return home. To date, the BWF has invested over $28 million in 261 innovative and impactful programs benefiting nearly 2 million people in communities where veterans, their families and caregivers live and work. </p>
<p>          Even with the BWF's efforts over the last ten years, as well as the contributions of numerous other veterans organizations, the continuing needs of our returning service members far outweigh the limited resources that are available.  Since September 11, 2001, 2.8 million American troops have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.  About 1.5 million have returned and a million more are coming home.  That said, only 1% of all Americans serve in the military, yet nearly all of us benefit from their sacrifices.  </p>
<p>          The time is now for all Americans to salute and adequately thank those who have risked everything for us.  One way you can show your appreciation for our injured American service members is by supporting the <b>Bob Woodruff Foundation's</b> participation in the <b>Walk of Britain</b>, a  1,000 mile odyssey starting in Scotland and winding down through Wales and England, finishing at <b>Buckingham Palace</b> on November 1, 2015.  The ten-week event is being held by <b>Walking With The Wounded</b> and will cover many of the country's most challenging landscapes, as well as hearts of cities.  You can see a map of the route below.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>          A truly remarkable group of six wounded veterans -- four British and two American -- will participate in the entire expedition. <b> </b>For example, the US Team, which is being sponsored by the BWF,<b> </b>is being anchored by former<b> </b><b>U.S. Marine Kirstie Ennis.  </b>She performed duties as a helicopter door gunner and was severely<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> wounded when her aircraft was shot down during her second deployment in Afghanistan.  Due to the crash, Sgt. Ennis sustained several severe injuries that include: full thickness facial trauma (leaving her face nearly unrecognizable with a hole where her jaw should be), damage to her cervical and lumbar spine, hearing impairment, bilateral shoulder trauma, traumatic brain injury, and left foot limb salvage.  Since being wounded, she has undergone 38 surgeries during the long recovery process (she is now a </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Team USA Paralympic </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">snowboarder).  Like many wounded, she has also endured disheartening challenges beyond her physical injuries, including survivor's guilt and three recent suicides of friends suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Of her fallen comrades, she says, </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""They never made it home, so I'm living, grieving, walking in their honor and in their memory.""</i><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>  </i></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.people.com/article/kirstie-ennis-marine-veteran-recovery-story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read her story here.</a></b></p>

<p>          In addition, to assist the <b>Walk of Britain's</b> fundraising and awareness efforts, the core team will be joined each week at different points during the journey by other wounded service personnel and celebrities, including <b>Prince Harry</b>, who is a leading patron of the event.   Beyond fundraising, the Prince, who recently retired from the British Army Air Corps as an Apache Air Commander, hopes that the expedition will remind people of <i>“the determination and resolve of those who have served, and in particular those who have been injured or suffer hidden wounds.”     </i>Of course, <b>Bob Woodruff </b>and others from the BWF will join the heroes and will be with them when they tackle <b>Pen Y Fan in the Brecon Beacons</b>, which is the highest peak in South Wales and is known for its use in British Special Forces selection.</p>

<p>          There is no doubt that after the wounded return to the love and support of their families and communities, many will continue to struggle.  One of every 50 has sustained a physical combat injury;  one in five suffers from post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury.  And while the physical and hidden injuries are often debilitating on their own, they often lead to a cascade of other troubles -- unemployment, marital issues, substance abuse, homelessness and suicide.  Sadly, the number of service members who commit suicide currently outnumbers those killed in actual combat.</p>
<p>     Your financial support of the BWF in the Walk of Britain will help honor and assist members of the US Armed Forces who have been injured serving you.  By doing so, you will assist the BWF with its continuing mission of identifying and supporting the best of breed in terms of impactful programs that provide vital assistance to the wounded and their families as they reintegrate into civilian life.  There is no doubt that long after the wars have wound down and the wounded have returned home, they will continue to need our assistance.  </p>

<h2>A Little About Me...<br/>
</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Heidi,</p>
<p>I first fell in love with creating food, along side my 
mother and paternal grandmother. I loved being around the tastes and smells of their kitchens. Their legacy of creating food with love, that made people happy, left an indelible impression, and, inspires me still. In fact, 
one of my most treasured possessions is a hand written notebook of 
recipes from my Mom, which she began creating in the 60's. 

</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440317436/kutce7kxkocq6731h0cn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 267.642px; height: 357px;""/></p>
</div> <div> <p>Maui Sweet Cakes was born out of my evolution as a Pastry Chef, which began when I first moved to Hawaii, Lanai to be exact, in 1994. It was on a fluke and was only to be temporary.  As soon as I landed on Lanai I immediately fell in love! The beauty of the environment, the lifestyle, the beach, and, the clear, warm water. After my time on Lanai, I moved to Maui, where I continued to hone my craft and in 2001, I opened my first bakery,  Cakewalk Bakery, in Paia. At Cakewalk, I offered my customers my favorite sweets, all hand-made from scratch daily. Many of these sweets still have a following today, (and one popular item is available as a perk)!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441067267/ibv9x1ml8yqj1e2yshgk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 371.486px; height: 495px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""width: 307.644px; height: 410px;""/></p>
<p>2010 brought about a sale of Cakewalk Bakery and a new direction.  Maui Sweet Cakes was born, specializing in wedding cakes. Still, my heart kept returning to the  joy of bringing smiles with small sweets, so,  in 2014 I decided to add a line of packaged cookies, one based on an old favorite from my childhood-Shortbread! They are buttery, flaky, and not too sweet. I started selling them to local retailers, and, they have been wildly popular ever since! I added to the excitement with my Sprinkle Cookies, large shortbread cookies covered edge to edge in colorful sprinkles, and Swirl Brownies, for those who want something more decadent!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440660657/pqmbhwy22bmtccbhtawg.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 354px; height: 354px;""/></p>
<h3>The next step...</h3>
<p>Since expanding the line, the response has been phenomenal! These sweets are flying out the door at local retailers, and now I'm in the fortunate position of having to take a business leap to continue to meet rising demand. Our treats are loved by local residents and visitors alike. While there are cookie competitors from other islands, it's time for a Maui option. I often hear from folks that found our goodies while visiting Maui and are thrilled to be able to take home a little taste of their tropical holiday.</p>
<p>This campaign will help us meet our growing demand and market our 
products both on Maui and beyond.  I've always felt proud to be able 
to give back to the community that has helped me live my passion, as a local business owner.  Maui Sweet Cakes is a product that
 will add to Maui's growing reputation for quality, locally produced and
 beautifully packaged products that represent our pride of place.  <br/></p>

A huge THANK YOU to all who have contributed so far! We are in the home stretch, but, need your help to reach our goal. I've added a couple new perks that are extra SWEET!   Please share this link with all who would be sorry to miss this opportunity to support a growing Maui business and snag a sweet treat in the process!                                                                                                                                                 We're about...Old Fashioned Goodness

Maui Sweet Cakes is a local, artisanal bakery, offering a tasty line of beautifully packaged Shortbread Cookies, Sprinkle Cookies, and Brownies! Our sweets are made by hand, with love, and available through local Maui retailers.





A Little About Me...

Hi, I am Heidi,
I first fell in love with creating food, along side my 
mother and paternal grandmother. I loved being around the tastes and smells of their kitchens. Their legacy of creating food with love, that made people happy, left an indelible impression, and, inspires me still. In fact, 
one of my most treasured possessions is a hand written notebook of 
recipes from my Mom, which she began creating in the 60's. 



  Maui Sweet Cakes was born out of my evolution as a Pastry Chef, which began when I first moved to Hawaii, Lanai to be exact, in 1994. It was on a fluke and was only to be temporary.  As soon as I landed on Lanai I immediately fell in love! The beauty of the environment, the lifestyle, the beach, and, the clear, warm water. After my time on Lanai, I moved to Maui, where I continued to hone my craft and in 2001, I opened my first bakery,  Cakewalk Bakery, in Paia. At Cakewalk, I offered my customers my favorite sweets, all hand-made from scratch daily. Many of these sweets still have a following today, (and one popular item is available as a perk)!




2010 brought about a sale of Cakewalk Bakery and a new direction.  Maui Sweet Cakes was born, specializing in wedding cakes. Still, my heart kept returning to the  joy of bringing smiles with small sweets, so,  in 2014 I decided to add a line of packaged cookies, one based on an old favorite from my childhood-Shortbread! They are buttery, flaky, and not too sweet. I started selling them to local retailers, and, they have been wildly popular ever since! I added to the excitement with my Sprinkle Cookies, large shortbread cookies covered edge to edge in colorful sprinkles, and Swirl Brownies, for those who want something more decadent!


The next step...
Since expanding the line, the response has been phenomenal! These sweets are flying out the door at local retailers, and now I'm in the fortunate position of having to take a business leap to continue to meet rising demand. Our treats are loved by local residents and visitors alike. While there are cookie competitors from other islands, it's time for a Maui option. I often hear from folks that found our goodies while visiting Maui and are thrilled to be able to take home a little taste of their tropical holiday.
This campaign will help us meet our growing demand and market our 
products both on Maui and beyond.  I've always felt proud to be able 
to give back to the community that has helped me live my passion, as a local business owner.  Maui Sweet Cakes is a product that
 will add to Maui's growing reputation for quality, locally produced and
 beautifully packaged products that represent our pride of place.  
Your contributions will enable me to expand Maui Sweet Cakes in the following ways:
* Hire more cookie ninjas! (i.e. expand our staff)
* Purchase needed kitchen equipment 
* Invest in professional-quality marketing materials and photography
* Conquer the WORLD-wide web by completing our e-commerce website

Lobban. I am a parent of Jamaican-Canadian origin. At the tender age of four, my daughter Zola began asking questions about her hair and skin color, as compared to characters she enjoys in books and on TV; characters that many of her friends look like.

</h3>
<p>I was raised among
people that looked like me as well as many other ethnicities that united to
create one culture - the Jamaican culture; a reflection of the motto ""Out
of Many One People."" Despite this background, it wasn't until I started
seeing the world through my daughters' eyes did I realize that <b>I too was
influenced by the lack of diverse characters in my world as a child</b>.
Because of this I began to recognize <b>insecurities that followed me through
adulthood</b>. Now in my late 30s I've begun to embrace what I once thought
made me different as what makes me a <b>unique and a worthwhile contribution to
society.  </b></p>
<p>In addition to being
a mom I own and
manage a successful hospitality sales and marketing consulting firm.  As a consultant, I have developed a keen eye
for identifying problems and creating solutions to optimize performance. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It is with these same eyes I've approached this
situation, I've encountered with my daughter and what I later learned a problem
that has become too common for comfort.</p>
<p></p>
<p> After going to the library and other local stores, I was shocked that <b>I couldn’t find
any storybooks or dolls to give my</b><b> daughter with pictures of
girls that look like her</b>. </p>
<p><b>How many of us can relate to this story?</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">While

<p><b>WHAT IS LITTLE PROUD KID</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Little Proud Kid</b> is an all-inclusive

<p><span></span></p>
<p><b>THE PROBLEM</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Today, minority children do not see themselves enough in the books they read, the films they watch, and the toys they play with.

<p>2. Feel ashamed of how they look</p>

<p>With no widely known central place that specializes in minority products for children parents turn to outlets like Amazon.

</div><br/></div>","Summary 

Growing up as a poor boy in the Tanzanian village of Mugeta, one of the most impoverished villages in
eastern Africa, Joash Gambarage did not put on his first pair of shoes until the day he borrowed one from a boy in a well-off family, for his grade 7 graduation ceremony. Today, Gambarage is a PhD candidate at UBC’s Department of Linguistics. He has made a profound difference by founding a school that brings hope and educational opportunities to the lives of many poor children in Mugeta. How grateful Joash is for the UBC Four-year-fellowship doctoral award that gave him the opportunity to study in Canada! 
As he describes in the video, in spite of hundreds of children who live in Mugeta, the village had only one elementary school. Because many families live in a difficult environment, many kids drop out of school and beg for money and food in the
streets. Gambarage sought a context which would make these poor children go back to school again; a context where children from impoverished families could access free nursery and elementary education and a free meal, and it is Mugeta Children's School (MUCS)  that provides such a context. 
MUCS is a community-based education project which has been supporting, educating and empowering boys and girls who would not otherwise have access to nursery and elementary school education since 2010. Through education Joash broke his vicious circle of poverty and we follow him in believing that education is the only tool that can provide opportunities for poor children to access resources to overcome their own difficulties and create their future lives. 
As part of that effort, our team is supporting this initiative by asking people to donate funds in order to address the water crisis in his school and community. The funds will also address urgent needs that will foster sustainability of the school and the greater Mugeta community. 
What is Needed
 
Despite the challenges, MUCS has already conquered numerous obstacles, and we are determined to keep the
school on a self-sustaining path to success. We have three major needs:
(i) The well for the school and for the surrounding residents. 
Mugeta is located in a semi-arid climate and for that reason the school and the community lack safe and clean water. The school and the Mugeta community rely on water from hand-dug bore holes which are dirty and unsafe. The underground water surveyor's report done submitted this September (thanks to Hope for Happiness for paying CAD$950 for the hydrological survey) recommends that a 95m deep underground well is capable of providing up to 100,000 litres of fresh water per hour. This is exciting news! The cost of drilling and setting up the well (including the cost for a water pump and pipes) is 7.5 million Tanzanian Shillings (aprox. CAD$5000). We also need two giant plastic reservoir tanks each capable of carrying 10,000 litres. Transportation and installation of the tanks require approximately CAD$2000.  
The water project will provide:   Safe and clean drinking water for the children and the surrounding Mugeta Community. This will prevent the current situation of kids suffering from cholera and other waterborne diseases because of using water from ponds and boreholes which are unsafe. It will also save women and children from walking long distances to bring a single bucket of hazardous-water.
The water project will also help to support the start-up of a sustainable community farm where children and the surrounding community can get affordable fresh vegetables, fruits and cereals. The farm will also provide a daily, nutritious breakfast and lunch for students. (For more information about Mugeta sustainable farm project click Hope for happiness page



    (ii) Classroom buildings

As shown in the video, MUCS has two modern classrooms that are currently being used, but do not have a floor and are not plastered yet. The budget for putting on a floor, plastering and painting is 3 million TZS (approx. $CAD 2,000). Thus to have these two projects done, in addition to the well, we are looking to raise CAD$9000. 
   Your donation at work The great thing about this project is that 100% of the proceeds raised will go directly to the project! 
If we meet our fund-raising goal the implementation will start immediately. As soon as the respective project is done we will post an update on our website (www.mugetachildren.com) and on our Facebook page Facebook page. Feel free to contact us by email or phone (given in the school website) if you have any inquiries. If we raise more money than our goal, we will use the money to implement the long term goals, eg. we have 3 more classrooms to be finished (as shown in the video) and this is the last phase of classroom extension (Kindergarten and grade 6-7). We also need more playground facilities for children, a library, and a computer room.

Volunteer opportunities!
A couple of people have volunteered with MUCS in the past. There are two major ways to volunteer with the project. You can volunteer with Hope for Happiness who will be launching the sustainable farm project (this is subject to completion of the water project) or you can go help with the English language program at MUCS where you can engage students in the singing and recital program, daily conversation in English, teaching them some sports and games,  running children's summer camp etc. Volunteer opportunities will be launched officially in the summer of 2016. Write to us if you are interested and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Even if you want to say a day or two at MUCS then head to Kilimanjaro, Zanzibar or to the Serengeti for Safari, MUCS is more than happy to host you!

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>As the list of issues facing our community increases, so does the need for positive outlets for youth development. <b><i>That's where YouthServe comes in.</i> </b></p>
<p>YouthServe Inc. was born of a merger between two existing organizations: First Look and Birmingham Youth Service Corps in 2004. Focused on its mission of empowering youth leadership through community service, YouthServe is the largest and most diverse non-religious youth organization in Birmingham.</p>
<p> Each year, our programs reach thousands of students from over 60 different schools across the region.  These students come together to not only serve the community but to become educated about issues facing teens and enhance their leadership skills in a safe and positive environment.<br/></p>
<p>We believe in our programming and realize the need for it in our community and our staff works tirelessly to extend YouthServe's reach, but we need your help.</p>
<p><b>One of our very generous donors has pledged $10,000 to YouthServe<i> if </i>we are able to raise $10,000! <i>That's where you come in. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>

As the list of issues facing our community increases, so does the need for positive outlets for youth development. That's where YouthServe comes in. 
YouthServe Inc. was born of a merger between two existing organizations: First Look and Birmingham Youth Service Corps in 2004. Focused on its mission of empowering youth leadership through community service, YouthServe is the largest and most diverse non-religious youth organization in Birmingham.
 Each year, our programs reach thousands of students from over 60 different schools across the region.  These students come together to not only serve the community but to become educated about issues facing teens and enhance their leadership skills in a safe and positive environment.
We believe in our programming and realize the need for it in our community and our staff works tirelessly to extend YouthServe's reach, but we need your help.
One of our very generous donors has pledged $10,000 to YouthServe if we are able to raise $10,000! That's where you come in. 


How Your Gift Helps
Service Education: 
$25 per student and $500 per class

Scholarship to Urban Service Camp:
$600 per camper
One Year of Leadership on Youth Action or Youth Philanthropy Council:
$2,000 per student
Work/Service Day Facilitation: 
$5,000 - $6,000


So far in 2015...





About YouthServe  YouthServe has grown and evolved over the years and now has four main areas of programming: Community Action; Service Education - service-learning curriculum that is taught in area schools; Urban Service Camps - three week-long residential camps in which teens perform community service while living downtown and engaging in social justice and development workshops; and the Youth Philanthropy Council - a program in which participating teens learn about philanthropy and award $20,000 to local organizations via The Joseph S. Bruno Foundation. 
In 2014, YouthServe was named Non-Profit of the Year (with a budget of under $500,000) by the Birmingham Business Alliance and continues to gain momentum today.

Most of my customers did not want bbq sauce on their meats because it tasted so good with just my rubs on it...so the sauce went on the side of plate and not on the meat.After I tested my rubs with the public I started doing bbq competitions and did very well up against the professional pit masters.That's when I started making my rubs and selling them to people that loved my food.To take my meat rubs and seasonings to the next level and have it produced in large quantities I need the funding to have a spice company make it for me.This guarantees that everything is done by the FDA regulations and keeps everything legal and safe.I already have my website www.carmensrubs.com and I  have my social networks ready to go.So if you love great food and love cooking great food then my meat rubs is what you will want.Thank you for your donations and please share this with your friends.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2 align=""center""><b>Welcome to Our Market Match Campaign for 2015</b></h2>
<b><br/></b>
<p>Four years ago Post Oil Solutions’ initiated a program at our
Winter Farmers’ Market to make local, nutritious food more available and
affordable to those who need it. It’s called the Market Match Coupon Program,
and the concept is simple: Folks who receive 3SquaresVT/EBT food benefits use their benefits at the market and have that money matched via market coupons up
to $10 to help them purchase more healthy local food.<span>  </span></p>
<p>This “double your money” offer can be repeated each week
throughout the season as long as our funds last.  It has encouraged families to
budget across the month and spend more of their EBT dollars locally. <br/></p>
<p>In their own words, some of our customers can help you understand the impact that this program has had on their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“This is a beautiful program! Community members eating healthy local food and increased business for our farmers – Everyone wins! ""<br/></i></p>
<p><i>“There is nothing more important to me than feeding my son homegrown healthy food and it is a huge blessing to be able to buy whole local food despite our low income. Thank you!”<br/></i></p>
<i></i><p><i>""As a single 63 year old on Social Security, this helps keep me in good health <i>.""</i></i></p>
<i><i>""</i>Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. With the rising cost of my medical expenses, my food budget was struggling big time.<i>""</i></i><p></p>
<p><i><i>""</i>It is of immeasurable help given food shelves sparseness of fresh produce, especially fruit.  Many thanks to all of you.<i>""</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>""</i>With recent cutback in SNAP benefits, this coupon program helps to fill the nutrition gap.<i>""</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>""</i>This is a HUGE help to us…my kids get fresh local food!<i>""</i></i></p>
<p><i><i></i></i></p>
<i><i>""</i>I really appreciate the match system.  It means that I don't have to choose between meat OR vegetables- it allows me to buy both and support farmers and the community while I do so!</i><i>""</i><br/><br/><p><i><i>""</i>Words can’t express how much this helps.  Thank you !!<i>""</i></i></p>
<p> Encouraging shoppers to shop at their local farmers market for fresh food rather than the convenience of packaged foods from the big box food stores is a challenge.  We can’t think of a better way to
directly impact our neighbors and community as a whole.  Can you help us? Approximately 100,000
Vermonters qualify for food stamp benefits under 3SquaresVT, but those dollars
can only go so far. That’s where our Market Match Coupons come in: to extend market
purchasing power and enhance the health of our community through good local
food. Market Match Coupons also provide increased income for our local farmers,
bakers, cheese and jams makers, all of whom are part of the local economy, so
it’s win-win-win all around!</p>
<p>Because of the success of the program over the past four years as
well as the increased number of our neighbors who are food insecure, we want to start off the 2015/2016 season with a solid base for this program to stretch their benefit dollars in the local economy.   That’s
why we are reaching out to the larger community to help us get a jump start on our 10th season.  Our goal is to raise $2500 to extend our existing fundraising efforts so our EBT customers can count on continued access to healthy fresh local food right through our last market of the season.  Any additional funds realized through this campaign will enable us to give our customers the confidence that this program will continue beyond the 2015/2016 season.<br/></p>All donations
are tax-deductible. Gifts of any size
are most appreciated and will help to support healthy families, vibrant farm
and food businesses, and the local economy.<span> 
All contributors will be acknowledged publicly at the market and in the
local press, however we have a variety of special thank you gifts to share with our top level supporters. <br/></span><p>For more

our oldest son and was diagnosed with autism back in the summer of 2013 when he was 2 1/2 years old. While
his progress since that time has been nothing short of amazing, the initial
diagnosis did come with its fair share of challenges
and obstacles including, but not limited to, sensory processing issues. For the
past two years, we have searched and scoured Orange County for a space that was
not only safe, intuitive, and engaging, but would also accommodate his
sometimes specific sensory needs.  Surprisingly, there weren't many...and
of those, none that suited our needs in a way that made sense.  So Wiggle
Room was born.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1392222/files/20150417104945-Nixon_Collage.png?1429292985"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>It would be an extension of our ambitions to create a sensory-rich environment for Nixon at home. An environment that not only met his basic sensory needs, but would also allow him to play freely and without the judgement, anxiety, and safety concerns that often come with other recreational options we've explored.  It would be a place where he would be watched over with caring, supportive, and knowledgeable eyes.  A space where he could not only play safely and positively with his little brother, but also interact and initiate play with peers on his own terms when he felt the most comfortable and regulated.  And that is what we want for <i>all </i>kids, not just ours. </p><p>Wiggle Room will be a space where you and your child will be accepted and embraced regardless of age and ability.  It will be a space where the activities and equipment will be <b>intuitive</b>, <b>fun</b>, <b>purposeful</b>, and most importantly, <b>safe</b> both in intent and application. It will be the space we've always wanted and hopefully the one you've wanted too.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1383183/files/20150414135924-who_we_are.png?1429045164"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1390044/files/20150416181320-About_Us.png?1429233200"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1380421/files/20150413165151-What_is_wiggleroom.png?1428969111"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p></p><p>Wiggle Room is a <b>fully enclosed</b>, <b>multi-purpose</b>,<b> all-inclusive</b> sensory studio designed with all the creature comforts you’ve come to expect in a children’s gym, but with the added benefit of having equipment and programs specifically tailored to meet the needs of children with autism, sensory processing disorders, and other developmental disabilities.  While it isn’t the first of its kind, Wiggle Room will be the first indoor play area of its kind in Orange County that specifically addresses sensory needs through an open-play model. Through the highest standards of quality and meticulous planning, we aim to provide not only a safe and supportive environment in which to navigate, but also one that is intuitively engaging, fun, and interactive for kids of <b>ALL</b> ages and abilities.  </p><p>In order to maintain the highest level of care, all of our staff will be First Aid/CPR certified as well as trained in positive behavioral strategies and proper use of gym equipment.  Our equipment will be of the highest quality and carefully selected with the help of an Occupational Therapy consultant.  And lastly, we fully intend on keeping our studio clean and sanitary by using only green products.</p>

<p></p><p>Secondly, we hope to be able to bridge the gap between the clinic and the home by providing  access to therapeutic play equipment and tools typically found in Occupational Therapy settings only.  At Wiggle Room, and as parents of an ASD child ourselves, we understand the importance as well as the costs involved in supplementing a child’s therapy with specialized sensory play and firmly believe that having access to sensory equipment should not be viewed as a luxury, but rather, as a necessity. </p><p>Lastly, we want to provide an experience that is as <b>comprehensive</b> as it is <b>unique</b>.  Whether it's utilizing our therapeutic swings, trampolines, and zip-lines or exploring the activities in the fine motor corner, taking a break in the chill-out zone, or taking advantage of our parent resource center, we want you to leave feeling that you've gained the most out of your experience here. Each and every time. </p>

<p></p><p>It affects autistic kids. Kids who often have difficulty processing sensory information such as textures, sounds, smells, taste, brightness, and movement. These difficulties can often make ordinary situations seem incredibly overwhelming.  Wiggle Room aims to not only address those needs in a fun and intuitive way, but also to teach families and provide them with a solid foundation of sensory-based activities that will hopefully extend beyond the doors of our studio.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1396687/files/20150419120141-ShavingCream.png?1429470101"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>It affects children with sensory processing disorder (SPD), a common disorder that affects many kids, both neurotypical and on the spectrum.  One study has shown that at least 1 in 20 children is affected by SPD with some experiencing symptoms chronic and significant enough to disrupt everyday life.  We want to provide a space that is supportive and meets children at whatever level of sensory integration they may require, whether that's finding a calming area to re-calibrate or simply burning off that excess energy after school.</p><p>It affects, well...children.  Our children.  Your children.  All children! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1396712/files/20150419121543-BeFunky_Collage.png?1429470943"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>While a space like this obviously provides numerous benefits for children with special needs, studies have shown that sensory play can have a <i>significant</i> impact on normal child development as well.  Infants and toddlers naturally initiate discovery about the world around them, so providing a variety of interesting sensory experiences can only pique their curiosity and support positive, healthy brain development... everything from physical, social, and communication skills down to cognitive/emotional development and a sense of self.  Wiggle Room looks to address all of those by engaging children through a diverse array of sensory experiences that appeal to all kids, whether it be through fine motor play, strength and conditioning, art, music, or even dance. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1380463/files/20150413171046-what_we_need-teal.png?1428970246"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>Help us open our doors in Orange County! Let’s face it, therapeutic equipment can be costly. Regular gym equipment can be costly.

Our goal for this campaign is to raise $16,000.  Now, you’re probably thinking, “no way is $16,000 enough to open this gym.”  And you are absolutely right!  What you’ll be helping us with during this particular campaign is raising the funds necessary to purchase the <b>actual</b> sensory equipment and tools that will be the cornerstone of our business.  </p><p>The remaining funds needed to open our doors will come from our own savings along with the contributions of our wonderful investors.  Your specific contributions will be making a direct impact on the development of our children by providing the very equipment and tools needed to make our space fully functional.  From the bolster swings, crash pads, and floor mats to each individual ball in our giant ball pit, you'll be  instrumental in making our dream a reality.  Without your contributions, our vision will just be that, a vision and not the wonderful sensory playground we, and this community, so desperately needs. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1380709/files/20150413191531-where_funds_will_go_-_purple.png?1428977731"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1380711/files/20150413191553-Graph.png?1428977753"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1391881/files/20150417092044-timeline.png?1429287644"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1400422/files/20150420161724-timeline_infographic__1_.png?1429571844"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1391886/files/20150417092244-perks_-_purple.png?1429287764"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>

</div></div>","Clinical Social Worker, friend of the family, and invaluable resource throughout our journey with autism, Peter Thach on Wiggle Room:Mother of twin auties, dedicated advocate for her sons, and valued friend of our family, Ana Calderon on Wiggle Room:BCBA, Social Skills Program Coordinator, long-time friend, and all-around good guy, Yagnesh Vadgama on Wiggle Room:
Nixon is
our oldest son and was diagnosed with autism back in the summer of 2013 when he was 2 1/2 years old. While
his progress since that time has been nothing short of amazing, the initial
diagnosis did come with its fair share of challenges
and obstacles including, but not limited to, sensory processing issues. For the
past two years, we have searched and scoured Orange County for a space that was
not only safe, intuitive, and engaging, but would also accommodate his
sometimes specific sensory needs.  Surprisingly, there weren't many...and
of those, none that suited our needs in a way that made sense.  So Wiggle
Room was born. It would be an extension of our ambitions to create a sensory-rich environment for Nixon at home. An environment that not only met his basic sensory needs, but would also allow him to play freely and without the judgement, anxiety, and safety concerns that often come with other recreational options we've explored.  It would be a place where he would be watched over with caring, supportive, and knowledgeable eyes.  A space where he could not only play safely and positively with his little brother, but also interact and initiate play with peers on his own terms when he felt the most comfortable and regulated.  And that is what we want for all kids, not just ours. Wiggle Room will be a space where you and your child will be accepted and embraced regardless of age and ability.  It will be a space where the activities and equipment will be intuitive, fun, purposeful, and most importantly, safe both in intent and application. It will be the space we've always wanted and hopefully the one you've wanted too.  Wiggle Room is a fully enclosed, multi-purpose, all-inclusive sensory studio designed with all the creature comforts you’ve come to expect in a children’s gym, but with the added benefit of having equipment and programs specifically tailored to meet the needs of children with autism, sensory processing disorders, and other developmental disabilities.  While it isn’t the first of its kind, Wiggle Room will be the first indoor play area of its kind in Orange County that specifically addresses sensory needs through an open-play model. Through the highest standards of quality and meticulous planning, we aim to provide not only a safe and supportive environment in which to navigate, but also one that is intuitively engaging, fun, and interactive for kids of ALL ages and abilities.  In order to maintain the highest level of care, all of our staff will be First Aid/CPR certified as well as trained in positive behavioral strategies and proper use of gym equipment.  Our equipment will be of the highest quality and carefully selected with the help of an Occupational Therapy consultant.  And lastly, we fully intend on keeping our studio clean and sanitary by using only green products.
Our goal here at Wiggle Room is three-fold.  First, we aim to encourage both positive social/emotional and physical growth through parent facilitated and/or self-guided exploration of our studio.  Whether amongst peers in one of our specially designed social skills groups or on their own, you’ll find that Wiggle Room provides just the right amount of function and support for all children to benefit from sensory motor play. 
Secondly, we hope to be able to bridge the gap between the clinic and the home by providing  access to therapeutic play equipment and tools typically found in Occupational Therapy settings only.  At Wiggle Room, and as parents of an ASD child ourselves, we understand the importance as well as the costs involved in supplementing a child’s therapy with specialized sensory play and firmly believe that having access to sensory equipment should not be viewed as a luxury, but rather, as a necessity. Lastly, we want to provide an experience that is as comprehensive as it is unique.  Whether it's utilizing our therapeutic swings, trampolines, and zip-lines or exploring the activities in the fine motor corner, taking a break in the chill-out zone, or taking advantage of our parent resource center, we want you to leave feeling that you've gained the most out of your experience here. Each and every time. 
Because we believe in it!  Honest to goodness.  But beyond that, because the impact of a space like this affects not just a tiny swath of the general population, but rather, an overwhelmingly large number of children…children of all ages, needs, and abilities. 
It affects autistic kids. Kids who often have difficulty processing sensory information such as textures, sounds, smells, taste, brightness, and movement. These difficulties can often make ordinary situations seem incredibly overwhelming.  Wiggle Room aims to not only address those needs in a fun and intuitive way, but also to teach families and provide them with a solid foundation of sensory-based activities that will hopefully extend beyond the doors of our studio.It affects children with sensory processing disorder (SPD), a common disorder that affects many kids, both neurotypical and on the spectrum.  One study has shown that at least 1 in 20 children is affected by SPD with some experiencing symptoms chronic and significant enough to disrupt everyday life.  We want to provide a space that is supportive and meets children at whatever level of sensory integration they may require, whether that's finding a calming area to re-calibrate or simply burning off that excess energy after school.It affects, well...children.  Our children.  Your children.  All children! While a space like this obviously provides numerous benefits for children with special needs, studies have shown that sensory play can have a significant impact on normal child development as well.  Infants and toddlers naturally initiate discovery about the world around them, so providing a variety of interesting sensory experiences can only pique their curiosity and support positive, healthy brain development... everything from physical, social, and communication skills down to cognitive/emotional development and a sense of self.  Wiggle Room looks to address all of those by engaging children through a diverse array of sensory experiences that appeal to all kids, whether it be through fine motor play, strength and conditioning, art, music, or even dance. Help us open our doors in Orange County! Let’s face it, therapeutic equipment can be costly. Regular gym equipment can be costly. Building a studio to house all that wonderful equipment is expensive.  But creating a space that is nourishing, safe, and fun for all kids is, well, as the cliché goes, priceless. Our goal for this campaign is to raise $16,000.  Now, you’re probably thinking, “no way is $16,000 enough to open this gym.”  And you are absolutely right!  What you’ll be helping us with during this particular campaign is raising the funds necessary to purchase the actual sensory equipment and tools that will be the cornerstone of our business.  The remaining funds needed to open our doors will come from our own savings along with the contributions of our wonderful investors.  Your specific contributions will be making a direct impact on the development of our children by providing the very equipment and tools needed to make our space fully functional.  From the bolster swings, crash pads, and floor mats to each individual ball in our giant ball pit, you'll be  instrumental in making our dream a reality.  Without your contributions, our vision will just be that, a vision and not the wonderful sensory playground we, and this community, so desperately needs.

The accessibility to all your digital
information anytime might become a problem. It’s a waste of time to be
constantly synchronizing your PC, Tablet and cell phone; and it’s a problem to
be a slave of the cloud and the data plans can be very expensive. These are
issues we want to solve in Csited.

Features
Improving the standard of life
The name of our product is Ascension. It’s a
wearable computing device you can wear on your wrist with the shape of a watch,
and it gives you the chance to gather all your digital data, info and apps in a
single device. Ascension is a full-operative PC with Windows 10 system, an
Intel AtomX5 processor and a smartphone all-in-one.
Wherever you are, whenever you want, you’ll be
able to make a non-delayed connection with an A-Screen in order to get access
to your dashboard. You’ll be able to use any screen the same way, either from
your PC or your HDMI TV, connect a mouse and a keyboard via Bluetooth and enjoy
a PC-like experience. Every screen can become a PC thanks to Ascension.














Security and connectivity
The connection between the watch and the screens
is completely automatic, and encrypted, so the only thing you’ll do is get
close to the screen and enjoy! The encryption is a good way to avoid other
devices from invading your watch






You don’t need a cloud, and you’ll be worried no
more with the safety of your personal data and info. You, and
you alone, are the owner of your data.



Battery


It makes no sense to use such a device as
useful as Ascension is if it cannot be running constantly. That’s why we have
included a 10Wh battery through our own patented technology. It provides 8
hours of constant use to Ascension.





You can recharge your Ascension through a Qi plate,
completely wireless and included in every one of the versions we’ll develop. It
contains an additional external 5Wh battery that can be plugged into the watch,
so it can last 4 hours more of use.






Physical features
Ascension is fully made with metallic equipment
and crystal to assure an IP56 certification of waterproof and dustproof
resistance.
Either for men or women by design, Ascension
will fit easily with any wrist such as a regular watch. It has an
electromagnetic lock to avoid it from being robbed and to prevent any fall.
User Experience
Previous sight of the Cortana, time and date applications.

</div></div>","Reclaimed Enterprises began in August of 2014 to solve multiple community problems--blight, demolition waste, and under/unemployment.
Omaha is home to more than 3,600 unfit/unsafe properties with close to 800 on the City's Demolition list. Habitat For Humanity of Omaha alone will take down 65 blighted properties in 2015, with an average age of around 100 years old . While these homes might be unfit to live in, they still have untapped value lying in the amazing resources inside each one. And for most of these homes, their final resting place will be a landfill. We wanted to change this by bringing a new industry to Omaha that will tackle the issue of waste while providing jobs to potentially hundreds of area workers.




In a few short months, we've fully deconstructed five properties and partially deconstructed a dozen others, saving more than 600 tons of waste from the landfill. We've partnered with local artists, makers and architects to turn old properties into restaurant tables, serving trays, wall paneling and more.

Now that we've proven our model can work, we're going to scale up our operation.



After
the first 100 days of delivering our deconstruction, design, build and installation services, the pilot phase of Reclaimed Enterprises is over.  With clarity around the most effective
execution of our business model in the Omaha market, we are ready for growth. Growth in blight
reduction, growth in waste diversion, and growth in jobs.
During
the course of this year, we will achieve this growth in community impact with our 50 in
15' campaign by:



We plan on growing our business no matter, but how much we can accomplish in 2015 depends on your support.







When you fund our 50 in 15' initiative your impact investment will be helping to reduce blight, divert waste, and create jobs. We also want to drive a general sense of appreciation for the beauty of reclaimed materials and for the history behind them. As a result, we want our impact investors to take something away with them that embodies that beauty and nostalgia. 








If for whatever reason the capital raised for our 50 in 15' campaign should fall short of our objective, Reclaimed Enterprises will still use whatever capital we earn in our crowdfunding campaign to grow our impact on blight reduction, waste diversion, and job creation in the Omaha community-it just may take a little longer. The key areas of investment for scale noted in the next section represent the drivers of our growth, and we will continue to invest our resources in those areas to grow our community impact.





With our initial successes behind us and our basic infrastructure in place, we are ready to scale our operation for greater impact and growth. We've identified the key areas we need to scale and the funds needed to do so.





Training & Program Development - Proven OJT training program from our national partner The Reuse People of America (TRP). Training for up to 36 deconstruction crew members including up to 7 crew chiefs and certification of two local trainers for ongoing program needs.


Deconstruction Capital & Capacity -  Deconstructing more properties not only requires more trained crew, it requires more tools, more vehicles, and more storage.  Additionally, the blighted urban and obsolete rural buildings we target cost us about $10,000 of working capital to deconstruct.

We have just begun conversations with retailers of product and materials to help us scale our distribution, but will need to devote more resources to this undertaking as we increase volume of material and level of impact.

Our makers and partner makers are passionate about using reclaimed materials. Our customers fall in love with the quality and history of the pieces. By adding makers to our team and network we increase capacity for reuse, and drive demand for the reduction of blight, diversion of waste, and creation of deconstruction jobs.

</div></div>","Intro 

Honouring Lola, a name shared by the owners’ beloved grandmother and great aunt, Fonda Lola
is the lovechild of two Mexico City expats.


Designed  and built by hand by one of them with rustic materials, painted ceramics and treasures brought from Mexico, stepping into
the funky little fonda (the Mexican word for casual bistro) feels like a trip to a beach-front cantina.

Based on the belief that quality food and drink can enhance the  well-being, Fonda Lola
showcases Mexican food beyond fish tacos and enchiladas, in an authentic atmosphere Lola
would be proud of. A new way of Mexican food , a lighter, locally sourced entity that cares for the souls and the palate.

<div><br/></div>It's our dream to bring an all vegan 24 hour convenience store to the heart of Los Angeles (and one day to open additional locations in other cities/states)! While it's true we live in a city with many vegan options, where do you go at 2AM to get that frozen vegan pizza you've been craving, or the nutritional yeast you forgot you needed for the late-night mac &amp; cheese recipe you're making? Or when you just need a jar of vegan mayo and don't want to go through the lines/aisle searching at a larger store? Wouldn't it be great to grab something off the shelves and not have to scan for animal ingredients or look up if that company is involved with animal testing? <span style="""">Don't you sometimes wish you could walk into one store and get nachos, a cup of coffee, a prepackaged sandwich and a bottle of soda in under ten minutes, like your pre-vegan days?</span>
</div><div>
<span style=""""><br/></span>
<p>That's what we're here for! We want to make being vegan easy, convenient, and extra fun! We plan to offer the vegan essentials as a one stop shop, to take the headache out of a full blown shopping trip. While we'll offer the basics, we also plan on having a smaller featured/harder-to-find products section, and to listen to what you, the customer, would like us to regularly stock!

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only is our mission to make life as a vegan more fun and simple, but it's also to show the general public that being vegan isn't as hard and complicated as they think. Once they step inside Convegance and see all the products that are available and that they never realized were vegan, we hope it'll cause a change in the way the vegan lifestyle is perceived in a positive way! And possibly convert them to the veg side ;D!<br/><br/>By helping fund Convegance, you're supporting a small, independently run vegan business!<br/></p>

<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>Cleantech: environmental clean-up innovators</p>
<p>Cleantech has developed a unique process that can clean up waste from
mining and other industrial activities – removing toxic chemicals and
extracting leftover precious metals at the same time. Help us take this process
around the world.</p>
<p><b>Our story</b></p>
<p>Industry
and mining produce toxic waste. It’s ugly and damages the environment. Imagine
if we could clean up these tailings and extract the existing metals (gold,
silver, platinum and other base metals) that are left over from the mining
process. While industrial clean ups may not have the same added bonus of
precious metals, the process of clean up can still be affordable.</p>
<p>Cleantech has the process to make this happen – and we’re already making
a start.</p>
<p>You have the chance to help us take this process around the world – you
get the feel-good from doing your bit for the environment and you’ll receive
the perks from the precious metals we extract in the process and from the
turnover produced from sites not containing precious metals.</p>
<p><b>The toxic
waste problem</b></p>
<p>Billions
of tonnes of toxic soil and tailings litter the globe. These tailings are
highly toxic, containing residues of the chemicals used in mining and industry,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>cyanide</b>
– just a few milligrams is fatal to humans</p></li>
<li><p><b>mercury</b> –
causes neurological damage and birth defects</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These
chemicals leach into waterways and soil, killing plant and animal life. Sadly,
in some countries people live close to these toxic sites, leading to many
health problems. </p>
<p><b>The hidden value</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hidden
in the waste produced by mining are precious metals like gold, silver and
platinum – left over from traditional mining methods. It’s normal for a
significant percentage of the mineral resource to be left behind in the waste
products. </p>
<p>Extracting
these precious metals at the same time as cleaning up the waste provides
Cleantech with an additional source of revenue and allows us to reward our
investors with our unique gold perks.</p>
<p><b>How Cleantech
cleans up</b></p>
<p>Cleantech uses a process developed over more than a decade of painstaking
research and testing: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The process
“washes” the waste to extract the toxins and the leftover metals</p></li>
<li><p>This turns the
remaining waste into clean dirt </p></li>
<li><p>This clean dirt can
be returned to the surrounding area for planting and habitat renewal</p></li>
<li><p>Our process
recycles as many resources as possible, including the water used, to ensure minimal
impact on the environment</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Constructing the processing plant provides employment opportunities in
the community. When our job is done, the site is clean. It can be used for
commercial or residential development, or left to regenerate as a habitat for
plants and animals.</p>
<p>We dispose of the toxic waste according to the environmental management
plan we set up for each contract and to comply with the regulations and laws of
each country. We always follow industry best practice standards.</p>
<p><b>We’re already
working on it</b></p>
<p>CleanTech
has access to the project rights of many tailings sites in Australia, the USA
and Asia. We’ve been invited by site owners to access their sites for condition
and products. First we test the soil to work out what needs to be cleaned and
then we make a plan with the owner for the clean-up. Following successful
independent tests, Cleantech is currently finalizing our first commercial
contract for the rehabilitation of a toxic site in Queensland, Australia. This
is a relatively small site with 32,000 tonnes of toxic waste in a tailings dam
and is an ideal first project for Cleantech.</p>
<p><b>What we’ll do
with your investment</b></p>
<p>Your contributions will enable us to take this tested, proven process
into full production. The first $150,000 will see the first
processing plant completed and the remaining $650,000 will fund a further
expansion that will allow us to process waste material at 30 tonnes per hour.
These plants will be based on a modular design that can be easily taken apart and
moved to other sites once the clean-up is completed. This modular design and
plant will apply to all future plants used by Cleantech, meaning we can expand
our approach to an international solution for toxic site clean-up. The modular
design of the production plants has already been completed, and all that
remains to be done is building them.</p>
<p><b>More than
mines</b></p>
<p>We’re not a mining
company and we’re not in competition with mines. We are an environmental clean-up company that can also generate revenue through
recovery of otherwise lost precious metals.</p>
<p>Our process can also be used to clean up contamination caused by other
industries. Although this doesn’t recover precious metals we hope that as the
value of our process becomes recognized, governments and industries will
contract us to clean up such sites. </p>

restaurant, take away et pâtisserie <b>LaTarte</b> est le lieu à découvrir
prochainement. C’est au cœur du 2<sup>ème</sup> arrondissement de Paris
qu’oscillant entre tradition et innovation nous allons vous faire retrouver des
plaisirs d’enfants et aiguiser votre curiosité gourmande. Le plaisir de gouter le croquant d’une pâte sablée, le croustillant d’une pâte feuilletée faite
maison.</p>
<p> Gouter une garniture sélectionnée avec
attention et goût pour que chaque bouchée éveille le palais. </p><b>

pâtisserie française.""<p></p><div><br/></div><div>Cette idée plutôt simple au départ de construire un concept de restauration autour d'un mono produit, m'est venue en observant autour de moi le nombre d'endroit où il possible de ""mal se nourrir"". Pouvoir profiter d'un repas simple mais de qualité, pouvoir se poser dans un cadre chaleureux est devenu un luxe dans nos vies urbaines. Une envie de proposer quelque chose de différent, une sorte de back to basic.</div><div>J'ai toujours aimé recevoir des amis et préparer des repas  pour les ravir.On peut dire que c'est ma manière de donner le sourire autour de moi. C'est mon père qui a été l'initiateur de cette passion.</div><div>Ancien directeur artistique dans le milieu de la mode, j'ai laissé mes 25 années de carrière de côté afin de pouvoir vivre ma passion et aujourd'hui je me forme dans l'une des plus grandes écoles culinaires ""<b>Ferrandi"".</b>
</div><div>
<b>LaTarte</b> est un projet de vie, et avant tout une manière de partager ma passion avec d'autres personnes. Je souhaite pouvoir les accueillir comme s'ils entraient chez-moi, et loin du style de nombreux autres endroits parisiens bien trop froids à mon goût et servant des produits sous vide ou industriels. Je veux aussi en faire un lieu d'échange et proposer des cours de pâtisserie autour de réalisations traditionnelles.</div><div>Je dispose d'une partie du financement, et j'ai la chance d'avoir des bec fins autour de moi qui croient en mon projet et me soutiennent. Toutefois il manque encore quelques fonds afin de pouvoir louer un local et le transformer en ""home sweet food"". </div><div>Je vous remercie d'avoir pris le temps de me lire et peut-être de m'aider, en espérant que prochainement je pourrai à mon tour aider. </div><div>

<p>"" Somewhere between a
restaurant, a take away and bakery shop... LaTarte is the place to be. It's in
the heart of the 2nd district of Paris oscillating between tradition and
innovation that you will remember your childhood pleasures  and sharpen
your greedy curiosity. The pleasure of enjoying a crisp, sugar crust pastry and
the crunch of a home-made puff pastry.</p>
<p>Enjoy a wide selection of
pastries chosen with delicate attention and taste so that every mouthful
awakens your tastebuds.</p>
<p>LaTarte is also the place
where you can come to satisfy your desire to learn by participating in our
collective or individual classes to learn what makes the French 'pâtisserie' so
special. </p>
<p>This rather simple idea to
build a concept of catering around an individual product, came to me by
observing several places around me, where it's only possible to ""eat
badly"". Being able to take enjoy a simple, high quality meal, in friendly,
 comfortable surroundings has become a luxury in our urban lives. My
desire is to propose something different, a kind of back to basics.</p>
<p>I have always loved
inviting friends to my home and preparing meals to delight them. I would say
that it is my way of having smiling faces around me . It was my father who was
the initiator of my passion.</p>
<p>Former art director in the

</div></div>","English version down page.""Entre
restaurant, take away et pâtisserie LaTarte est le lieu à découvrir
prochainement. C’est au cœur du 2ème arrondissement de Paris
qu’oscillant entre tradition et innovation nous allons vous faire retrouver des
plaisirs d’enfants et aiguiser votre curiosité gourmande. Le plaisir de gouter le croquant d’une pâte sablée, le croustillant d’une pâte feuilletée faite
maison.
 Gouter une garniture sélectionnée avec
attention et goût pour que chaque bouchée éveille le palais. 

LaTarte est aussi le lieu où l’on peut venir
satisfaire son envie d’apprendre en participant aux cours collectifs ou
particuliers sur  ce qui a fait la
pâtisserie française.""Cette idée plutôt simple au départ de construire un concept de restauration autour d'un mono produit, m'est venue en observant autour de moi le nombre d'endroit où il possible de ""mal se nourrir"". Pouvoir profiter d'un repas simple mais de qualité, pouvoir se poser dans un cadre chaleureux est devenu un luxe dans nos vies urbaines. Une envie de proposer quelque chose de différent, une sorte de back to basic.J'ai toujours aimé recevoir des amis et préparer des repas  pour les ravir.On peut dire que c'est ma manière de donner le sourire autour de moi. C'est mon père qui a été l'initiateur de cette passion.Ancien directeur artistique dans le milieu de la mode, j'ai laissé mes 25 années de carrière de côté afin de pouvoir vivre ma passion et aujourd'hui je me forme dans l'une des plus grandes écoles culinaires ""Ferrandi"".

LaTarte est un projet de vie, et avant tout une manière de partager ma passion avec d'autres personnes. Je souhaite pouvoir les accueillir comme s'ils entraient chez-moi, et loin du style de nombreux autres endroits parisiens bien trop froids à mon goût et servant des produits sous vide ou industriels. Je veux aussi en faire un lieu d'échange et proposer des cours de pâtisserie autour de réalisations traditionnelles.Je dispose d'une partie du financement, et j'ai la chance d'avoir des bec fins autour de moi qui croient en mon projet et me soutiennent. Toutefois il manque encore quelques fonds afin de pouvoir louer un local et le transformer en ""home sweet food"". Je vous remercie d'avoir pris le temps de me lire et peut-être de m'aider, en espérant que prochainement je pourrai à mon tour aider. 

"" Somewhere between a
restaurant, a take away and bakery shop... LaTarte is the place to be. It's in
the heart of the 2nd district of Paris oscillating between tradition and
innovation that you will remember your childhood pleasures  and sharpen
your greedy curiosity. The pleasure of enjoying a crisp, sugar crust pastry and
the crunch of a home-made puff pastry.
Enjoy a wide selection of
pastries chosen with delicate attention and taste so that every mouthful
awakens your tastebuds.
LaTarte is also the place
where you can come to satisfy your desire to learn by participating in our
collective or individual classes to learn what makes the French 'pâtisserie' so
special. 
This rather simple idea to
build a concept of catering around an individual product, came to me by
observing several places around me, where it's only possible to ""eat
badly"". Being able to take enjoy a simple, high quality meal, in friendly,
 comfortable surroundings has become a luxury in our urban lives. My
desire is to propose something different, a kind of back to basics.
I have always loved
inviting friends to my home and preparing meals to delight them. I would say
that it is my way of having smiling faces around me . It was my father who was
the initiator of my passion.
Former art director in the
fashion world, I left my career of 25 years  aside to be able to live my
passion and today I am training in one most renowned culinary schools  
"" Ferrandi "".
LaTarte is a life plan,

<p>Before introducing the <b>Urbamobile
Transportation System</b> one thing should be noted: however unbelievable or
fantastic it may seem, implementing this System on a broad and global level,
without exaggeration, opens up a new era in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is exactly the
fatally hopeless organization of motor-car traffic in the actual absence of
feasible alternatives that predetermined a rather bleak picture until recently.</p>
<p>But now when the urbamobile is
invented giving the realistic chance of organizing everything in a fundamentally
different way. Implementing the amazing urbamobile ability to easily move
around disregarding contact and ensuring good maneuvering in a squeezed space
environment due to optimal design and control offered by the <b>Urbamobile Transportation
System</b>.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FVNHS1YaY7v4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVNHS1YaY7v4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FVNHS1YaY7v4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>In fact all the benefits of modern
transportation systems for which long-term sustainable development is
absolutely impossible are achieved now by stronger violation of the person’s
peace, distortion of social relations, environmental damage, and are inevitably being destroyed by an increasing number of vehicles.</p>
<p>An increasing number of urbamobiles
in the <b>Urbamobile Transportation System</b>, on the contrary, is an obvious,
progressionally growing benefit, both environmental and social, which is based
not on illusory, ideal good intentions and pipedreams, but on absolutely real,
totally objective material properties of urbamobiles and their System.</p>

Such unique features make the <b>Urbamobile
Transportation System</b> look like the only real prospect of transport development
for individual projects of the future as well as for universal global progress.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445948511/b1dvvanp5q2g0k6iovc2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The maintenance is fully automated.</p>
<p>There are endless perspectives for
optimization of usage and cheapening of components, like batteries, electric
motors, etc.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the
<b>Urbamobile Transportation System</b>, the opportunities which are unavailable in
the traditional transportation systems open up literally in everything,
promising both new ways of economic development and, more generally, positive
development in the broadest sense.</p>
<p>The<b> </b> Urbamobile utilizes everything
in the most efficient way – solar power, wind power, stopping power, saves
acceleration energy, etc. <br/></p>
<p>The universal round shape of the
urbamobile is an ideal tool to minimize and optimize all calculations
associated with its positioning, which is based on a sole central spot on its
surface.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGZnrXwjNr3c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGZnrXwjNr3c&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FGZnrXwjNr3c%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

As it saves the scope of computation, the

<p>For example, absolute transport

 km from the center of modern cities, significantly
expands the possibilities for almost equally comfortable living. This makes

should reduce realty prices in downtown areas hopelessly losing their
commercial exclusivity, by dozens of percent, and create an ever growing supply
of extremely cheap-to-build property in huge areas, equally valuable from all
perspectives, at prices that inevitably tend to a very low construction cost.</p>

repairs, maintenance, limitations, liability, and other onerous beauties and
unpleasant surprises associated with a personal car.</p>
<p>At the same time, the <b>Urbamobile

substantial risk of death or injury under motor car wheels, inevitable
difficulties and inconveniences of public transport, other dangers and troubles
that people unwilling or unable to use a car of their own simply have to put up
with. </p>
<p>In the <b>Urbamobile Transportation

Before introducing the Urbamobile
Transportation System one thing should be noted: however unbelievable or
fantastic it may seem, implementing this System on a broad and global level,
without exaggeration, opens up a new era in the history of mankind.
Unfortunately, it is exactly the
fatally hopeless organization of motor-car traffic in the actual absence of
feasible alternatives that predetermined a rather bleak picture until recently.
But now when the urbamobile is
invented giving the realistic chance of organizing everything in a fundamentally
different way. Implementing the amazing urbamobile ability to easily move
around disregarding contact and ensuring good maneuvering in a squeezed space
environment due to optimal design and control offered by the Urbamobile Transportation
System.
In fact all the benefits of modern
transportation systems for which long-term sustainable development is
absolutely impossible are achieved now by stronger violation of the person’s
peace, distortion of social relations, environmental damage, and are inevitably being destroyed by an increasing number of vehicles.
An increasing number of urbamobiles
in the Urbamobile Transportation System, on the contrary, is an obvious,
progressionally growing benefit, both environmental and social, which is based
not on illusory, ideal good intentions and pipedreams, but on absolutely real,
totally objective material properties of urbamobiles and their System.

Such unique features make the Urbamobile
Transportation System look like the only real prospect of transport development
for individual projects of the future as well as for universal global progress.
Unlike the automotive system, the
Urbamobile Transportation System is surely the ""smartest"" and most
environmentally friendly system of logistics and transportation, is completely
safe for humans and the environment.

The System provides mobility in a
most efficient way. 
The System really helps simply
eliminate the distances, create completely universal, global and at the same
time individual, exceptional opportunities for almost perfect optimization of
any vehicle traffic, like mobile communications and the Internet help optimize
the information traffic.
For normal driving, the urbamobile
with its remarkable universal round shape can get along with just two wheels
that do not require any mechanical control.  
Ideal for all digital and Internet technologies.
The urbamobile is
protected from damage upon contact; moreover, it ensures control and
maneuverability specifically in contact and allows rotation, too.Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting: “ROADS KILL” The global
road death toll has already reached 1.24 million per year and is on course to
triple to 3.6 million per year by 2030.
The Urbamobile
parking is compact, extremely compact. It is performed completely in driverless
mode. Almost in any way: in a chain, in a column, etc. 

The maintenance is fully automated.
There are endless perspectives for
optimization of usage and cheapening of components, like batteries, electric
motors, etc.
With the introduction of the
Urbamobile Transportation System, the opportunities which are unavailable in
the traditional transportation systems open up literally in everything,
promising both new ways of economic development and, more generally, positive
development in the broadest sense.
The  Urbamobile utilizes everything
in the most efficient way – solar power, wind power, stopping power, saves
acceleration energy, etc. 
The universal round shape of the
urbamobile is an ideal tool to minimize and optimize all calculations
associated with its positioning, which is based on a sole central spot on its
surface.

As it saves the scope of computation, the
Urbamobile Transportation System ensures such a huge integration potential that
it helps systemically incorporate literally everything in the equation,
including  optimal distribution of
urbamobiles depending on the population density, social environment,
specificity of transportation, road capabilities, environment and weather
conditions, etc.- and any other unexpected circumstances.
For example, absolute transport
accessibility, in areas up to 100
 km from the center of modern cities, significantly
expands the possibilities for almost equally comfortable living. This makes
absolutely impractical extremely expensive multi-storied house construction and
should reduce realty prices in downtown areas hopelessly losing their
commercial exclusivity, by dozens of percent, and create an ever growing supply
of extremely cheap-to-build property in huge areas, equally valuable from all
perspectives, at prices that inevitably tend to a very low construction cost.
And this is just one examples of
fundamental positive changes that can be brought about by the Urbamobile
Transportation System in people’s lives.
Generally speaking, the Urbamobile
Transportation System enables a really large number of people to completely,
and permanently, forget about traffic jams, parking areas, fines, crashes, car
repairs, maintenance, limitations, liability, and other onerous beauties and
unpleasant surprises associated with a personal car.
At the same time, the Urbamobile
Transportation System helps everybody else forget, fully and forever, about the
substantial risk of death or injury under motor car wheels, inevitable
difficulties and inconveniences of public transport, other dangers and troubles
that people unwilling or unable to use a car of their own simply have to put up
with. 
In the Urbamobile Transportation
System, everything moves so easily and quickly that rest and motion almost
cease to differ, and distances stop being a significant factor.
While the Urbamobile Transportation
System offers ultimate customization and full automation, it makes the driver’s
function in a vehicle completely unnecessary, implements a completely new
ideology of transport infrastructure organization, which gives it a lot of new
features, completely missing now from all other systems, including:
                                              
We invite everyone to contribute to
the development of the Urbamobile Transportation System so that it helps, in
the very near future, fundamentally, successfully and definitively to resolve
the transport and logistical problems facing all and positively impact the
process of tackling numerous global economic, social and even political
problems of today. 
Certainly, the development of the
Urbamobile Transportation System and the introduction of urbamobiles can and
should proceed by gradual, evolutionary substitution of other modes of
transport, without creating new risks of any economic, social or political
tensions and reducing the existing risks.

The team means everyone who knows and realizes
that all is not lost. And does business. Our business. Everybody’s business.
And willingly shares what he can share. Understanding. Trust. Hope. Assistance.
Involvement. Neatness. Intelligence. Skills. Talent.
The
first thing that happens when people hear about an urbamobile or the urbamobile
transportation system for the first time is failure to understand. First,
failure to understand how indeed this works. Followed by failure to understand
if it really is that simple. And at the end, failure to understand: if all is
so simple and so great, where is it? 
And finally, EVERYONE says: all and
everyone will not ever see that good thing happen because things can’t be that
good! And everyone starts persuading himself to stop even hoping: nobody is
going to believe that, nobody is going to allow that, the bureaucrats will not
authorize, the enemies will not approve, the manufacturers will be strongly
against, and the consumers do not have a say… YES, THEY DO!!! It’s OUR demand
that determines THEIR supply. Hence, everyone who does spend a little time and
effort to realize what the Urbamobile and Urbamobile Transportation System are
about IS PART OF OUR TEAM.
A
lot of people already contribute to our efforts, providing individual services,
responding to requests, acting in various areas more or less independently. It
would probably be unfair to single out anyone of those who already understands,
who is convinced and really involved in work. It may be that we haven’t met
some people – literally, the number of those who opts for the URBAMOBILE and
the URBAMOBILE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM grows every single day. 
Surprisingly, but we have reasons to believe that nature itself, as well as numerous inhabitants
of this planet, agrees with us. The charming Beatrice definitely thinks so:                                  
And she doesn’t mind either if vehicles do not
kill nature, whether literally or figuratively.
  I,
the author and organizer, am sure of that, too:
                                                                 I realize that -
- firstly, it is the author
enforcing and protecting his copyright and patent rights to the maximum extent
possible who necessarily must do all he can to make sure the Urbamobile system
doers not repeat the sad fate of nearly all complicated technical systems known
to mankind where any fundamentally new technical solution imminently attracts
an uncountable number of variators parasitically feeding on copyright and
patent right protection imperfections. Essentially, under the guise of
aspiration for diversity, they create extra complications for consumers, such
as various forms, sizes, formats, connectors, protocols, etc., which are hardly
compatible, if at all, and then epically and infinitely struggle through them,
stealing more and more money from consumers’ wallets for their services;
  -
secondly, the sooner and harder an ever growing number of people contribute
increasingly to the emergence of the URBAMOBILE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, the
sooner all of its remarkable benefits stop being a dream and become as natural and common as mobile communication or the
Internet. Already now, there are no outward insurmountable obstacles hampering
the introduction of URBAMOBILES and the URBAMOBILE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.
Moreover, reality is inevitably pushing us to them.

<p>I am writing from a cold back room of our current headquarters.  I feel sad and tired and alone, and yet when my thoughts turn to the subject I want to write about, there is this sudden inkling of warmth and joy, no matter how disheartening the situation we find ourselves in is. The thing I want to write about is love. Of myself, of you, of living in harmony with one and other. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As a part of Pro Dialog, z.s. a nonprofit that has a history working with domestic violence here in Prague, Czech Republic, we continue doing what we started in 2012, when Mariana and I founded <a href=""http://www.zdejsoulvi.cz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here be lions</a>, to share what is important for us with other people, among other <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nonviolent Communication</a> and <a href=""http://www.restorativecircles.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Restorative Circles</a>. Some of you who are now reading this are people we met during that time, who expressed interest and gratitude for what we do. </p>
<p><b>We need support to continue our work now and I write this text to create an opportunity for those who I think would enjoy doing so. </b>We have a project with the Ministry of Justice to meet with communities where violent acts occurred and support them in finding out how to communicate in a way that has a bigger chance to be understood by the other parties than a blow to someone's face, gun in someone's hand. </p>

<p>We apply for various funding options every year. In 2015 we did got smaller amounts than the year before, which in combination with our over all situation lead to a money crisis. As of the time of writing this, Pro Dialog doesn't have any money in its bank account. What more, we owe money. We owe 200000 CZK (7882$) to a company owned by Mariana's father and 100000 CZK  (3941$) to one of our members, who paid for some of our work during the last year using her own savings, working for free herself. Most of us were paid just partly in November. We are not sure how much we will be paid in December.</p>

<p>For a long time Pro Dialog,z.s. operated on some kind of basic trust that everybody is working on their part of the current project and automatically understands and agrees on what that part is. We often had prolonged conversation about certain events and agreed about our values, which created the illusion that we also agree on the actions we need to take. This became more and more visible over time, when we were repeatately finding ourselfs in situations when we did something we thought is aligned with what we talked about and the other members did not think so (and vice versa). With the repetition, the basic trust was shaken. Which was a good thing in a way, because it highlighted the fact that more understanding is necessary for us to move forward <i>and willingness to change was born</i>. The money crisis was a final straw. The conflict is now loud enough that we decided to take time from working to talk about topics important for us functioning together. Some of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><b>What do we do in a conflict</b> </b>- How can we talk and be sure we are heard the way we want to be? How can we all feel safe sharing our truths? What works for us as a group, what doesn't work? We are an interesting mix of people from different backgrounds working with different methods. There is a great potential for us to support one another, but often we also misunderstand what somebody says or feel threaten by it, because what we do is very important to us. We hope that if we create a system that would support our safety and understanding, it would lead to bigger cooperation between us and more support for all involved.</li>
<li>
<b><b>Principles we live by and how they manifest in actions we do</b> - </b>We noticed we are in full agreement when talking about principles we aspire to work and live by and we are also sometimes afraid when we see somebody do something we interpret as not aligning with those principles. We want to learn more about one another and know why each of us does what he/she does.</li>
<li>
<b><b>Money </b>- </b>We would like to transition from being reliant on government funding which is unpredictable to being financed from the community of people who find our work valuable. We would like to communicate more about money between each other, decide together how we use what we have so we cover needs for everyone involved and no one alone feels responsible for how money is used or for securing enough of it. With this in place we hope we would see next upcoming money crises earlier and had more ways of solving it if not preventing it from happening at all.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Our vision is that by making space for these continuous talks we will replace the illusion of understanding by real understanding and real action plan, which cares for needs of all of us. My hope is that we will shift from acting out of fear of loosing government funding to a place of possible abundance, leaving behind thoughts about what ""is not possible to do"" and instead think about ""what do we need to make this possible"". So the answer to the question if crises like this is likely to happen again is: Possibly, and our vision is to have systems in place that would make it possible for us to see it earlier, care for it and make it more of an opportunity to make things better instead of a scary thoughts about not knowing how will we survive next months.</p>

<p>Pro Dialog, z.s. has seven members.

For us to get paid at full (which includes mandatory payments to our government like taxes and health insurance) we need 200 000 CZK (7882$) a month. </p>
<p>We also need to pay for the space we are renting and utilities, which is 100 000 CZK (3941$) for 5 months. It needs to be payed beforehand.</p>
<p>We are expecting to get more money in April, as we applied for various forms of funding for the next year. To cover the time from now to April we would need: </p>
<p>4x 200 000 CZK (7882$) = 800 000 CZK (31 528$) for the seven of us to live on</p>
<p>100 000 CZK (3941$) to rent the space we work in and the services needed</p>

<p><b>It is a big number. I would like to encourage people to donate even if it is just a few dollars they can spare with joy. Every sum is valuable. See here:</b></p>
<p><b>100 CZK (4$)</b> = take out lunch for one of us so we do not have to worry about our rumbling stomach when wanting to concentrate on what is said</p>

GratitudePart of why it is possible for me to write this text is the continous support from my colleagues. 
Anna, who gave me money to buy myself lunch today and with that a renewed hope that we will not go under. 
Honza, with whom I talked about people we work with and for the first time that week I felt the enthusiasm again. 
Michal, with whom I can laugh and who sometimes stays connected to the principles when I am not able to and by doing it he pulls me back in. 
Jindřiška, who bravely said yes to us doing all this in the name of Pro Dialog, z.s. after a life long expirience with how dangerous it might be to be doing something different, something new. 
Daniela, who names things clearly and is interested in uncovering what is going on. 
And Mariana, who opened one door after another, who loves me, who showed me some aspects of the world I want to live in that I would have forggoten about. 
I want them all to have space to concentrate on doing what is meaningful to them too.

Todos en Bici is an inclusive community that is committed to making bike-based exploration accessible to everyone. In December a group of 20 bikers of all ages and abilities-- young folks, old folks, cyclists with many years of experience, new bikers, people with disabilities, blind riders, and deaf riders​-- will embark on a 1,300 km bicycle journey across the Baja California desert. We will travel from town to town sharing our stories with each other and with the people that we meet. We will film our journey, creating an experimental documentary that inspires others to explore their world through cycling. Our journey takes place December 27, 2015 - January 12, 2016.Viajar en bicicleta es la forma más sostenible y abierta de explorar el mundo. Todos en Bici es un proyecto incluyente que se ha comprometido en poner la exploración en bici al alcance de todos. En diciembre, un grupo de 20 ciclistas de todas las edades y capacidades--personas jóvenes, ancianos, ciclistas con muchos años de experiencia, nuevos ciclistas, personas con discapacidades, personas ciegas y sordas-- se embarcará en un viaje de 1.300 kilómetros a través del desierto de Baja California. Vamos a viajar de pueblito a pueblito compartiendo nuestras historias en grupo y con las personas que iremos conociendo en el camino. Vamos a filmar nuestro viaje para hacer un documental experimental que inspirará a otros a explorar su mundo a través del ciclismo. Nuestro viaje empieza el 27 de diciembre 2015 y viajaremos hasta el 13 de enero de 2016.














RIDERS OF ALL AGES AND ABILITIES:  We are an inclusive group of riders, all with unique abilities and perspectives. Our group includes passionate people of all kinds--young folks, old folks, cyclists with many years of experience, new bikers, people with disabilities, blind riders, and deaf riders.
CICLISTAS DE TODAS EDADES Y CAPACIDADES: Somos un grupo incluyente, compuesto de participantes con habilidades y perspectivas distintas. Nuestro grupo incluye gente apasionada de todo tipo--personas jóvenes, ancianos, ciclistas con muchos años de experiencia, nuevos ciclistas, personas con discapacidades, personas ciegas y sordas.



RIDING IN PAIRS: Because of our varying abilities and levels of experience, we ride in pairs to create supportive partnerships within our group. Each partnership consists of an experienced cyclist with someone who is new to this type of adventure. Some pairs ride on individual bikes, others on tandems and specially adapted bicycles.
RODANDO EN PAREJAS: Debido a nuestras diferentes capacidades y niveles de experiencia, nos organizamos en parejas para crear asociaciones de apoyo dentro de nuestro grupo. Cada asociación se compone de un ciclista con experiencia con alguien quien es nuevo en este tipo de aventura y necesita el apoyo para cumplirla. Algunas parejas se moverán en bicicletas individuales, otros en tándems y bicicletas adaptadas para necesidades especiales.









THE JOURNEY: Our journey begins in Ensenada, Mexico and follows Highway 1 as it travels south from ocean to sea, cutting across hundreds of kilometers of desert valley and mountains. The route is home to dozens of small fishing and farming towns separated by many kilometers of vast desert. We will camp in towns, beaches, and desert wilderness, every night making home in a new place. Our journey ends on the sea of Cortez in the city of La Paz. 
LA RUTA: Nuestro viaje comienza en Ensenada, México y sigue la Carretera 1 desde el océano al mar, cortando a través de cientos de kilómetros de valles y montañas. La ruta es el hogar de decenas de pueblitos pesqueros y agrícolas separados por muchos kilómetros de desierto extenso. Vamos a acampar en las ciudades, playas, y el desierto. Cada noche hacemos nuestra casa en un nuevo lugar. Nuestro viaje termina en el mar de Cortés en la ciudad de La Paz .




BIKING FROM TOWN TO TOWN: We will spend our days biking between towns. Winter weather in Baja is perfect for biking: dry, cool and sunny. In the mornings we will have breakfast at camp. After packing up our camp we will hit road. Daily rides will range from 50 km to 140 km. While on the road we will ride as a group, occasionally stopping rest and gaze out into the desert and ocean. Before sunset, we will arrive at our destination for the evening and set up camp once again.
RODANDO DE PUEBLITO A PUEBLITO: Vamos a pasar nuestros días andando en bicicleta entre los destinos. El clima de invierno en Baja es perfecto para el ciclismo: seco, fresco, y soleado. Por la mañana desayunamos en el campamento. Después de empacar, vamos a salir por la carretera. Los paseos diarios son de 50 km a 140 km. En el camino vamos a andar como un grupo, parándonos de vez en cuando para descansar, comer, y apreciar el desierto y el océano. Antes del atardecer, llegaremos a nuestro destino para hacer nuestro campamento, una vez más.​​




CAMPING IN THE TOWNS: COMMUNITY NIGHTS: Most days we will end our daily journey in a small town or city. We will set up our camp at community centers, schools, churches, parks, and other places depending on the town. During these community nights, we will host cultural sharing events and meals. We will have the opportunity to share our stories and perspectives with the people of the town. We will introduce people to the joy of bicycle travel.ACAMPANDO EN PUEBLITOS: NOCHES COMUNITARIAS: La mayoría de los días vamos a terminar nuestra jornada diaria en un pequeño pueblito o ciudad. Vamos a establecer nuestro campamento en centros comunitarios, escuelas, iglesias, parques y otros lugares dependiendo de la localidad. Durante estas noches en las comunidades, vamos a organizar eventos de intercambio cultural. Tendremos la oportunidad de compartir nuestras historias y perspectivas con la gente de la ciudad. Vamos a introducir a la gente a la alegría de los viajes en bicicleta.​​​




CAMPING IN THE WILDERNESS: RETREAT NIGHTS: Several nights we will camp outside of towns in the mountains, valleys, or on beaches. There we will have the opportunity to share more intimately among each other. During these retreat nights pairs will host different activities, and we will cook and eat together under the stars. 
ACAMPANDO EN EL DESIERTO: NOCHES DE RETIRO: ​Varias noches acamparemos fuera de las ciudades en las montañas, valles, o en las playas. Asi, vamos a tener la oportunidad de compartir más íntimamente entre nosotros. Durante estas noches de retiro pares guiarán diferentes actividades. Vamos a cocinar y comer juntos bajo las estrellas.





FILMING OUR STORY: We will share our story with people across the world. Our documentary is a rich and intimate research experiment in storytelling whose ultimate goal is to inspire empathy and imagination. The goal is to expose people to the transformative nature of bicycle travel and to explore the ways in which the bicycle can be made accessible to everyone. In addition to our main camera, we will have a collective camera. Each pair will have the opportunity to film for a day, sharing their perspective of their personal journey.  
FILMANDO LA HISTORIA: Vamos a compartir nuestra historia con gente de todo el mundo. Nuestro documental es un íntimo experimento de investigación narrativa cuyo objetivo final es inspirar la empatía y la imaginación . El objetivo es exponer el poder transformador de los viajes en bicicleta y explorar las formas en que la bicicleta puede hacer accesible para todos. Además de nuestra cámara principal, tendremos una cámara colectiva. Cada pareja tendrá la oportunidad de filmar durante un día, compartiendo la perspectiva de su viaje.​

<p>Within Albany’s 5 mile radius, you will find every industry from retail spaces, cultural centers, food and beverage establishments, the heart and soul of these businesses residing on Solano Ave and San Pablo Avenue.

To combat this fate for their community, Scott and Vonnie Davidson of local brewery Ocean View Brew Works have organized this fundraising campaign to protect their vibrant business district and those who are employed at these establishments; they are calling upon our communities near and far to help in this endeavor with monetary donations and sharing this campaign to our networks, all proceeds going to Albany businesses needing immediate support. Using an application process for businesses to receive aid designed and managed by Working Solutions, they are hoping the funds raised will support the livelihoods of those with varying needs working in the community, the total sum of what will be raised being the determining factor in how aid can be distributed. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hey, y’all! I'm <a href=""https://theamericandreammakers.com/admstudios/our-team/krystal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Krystal Casey</a> and I have a BIG vision! I'm on a mission to connect and empower women in our local communities through music, movement and meditation by introducing a new Dance &amp; Wellness Center for Women - The ADM Studios! </p>
<h3>Why We Need The ADM Studios</h3>
<p>How many times have you been wanting to get out of the house, but find yourself with nowhere to go? Let’s face it: life gets rough for all of us at times. Between caring for your spouse and/or your kids, work, school, balancing the household and the 243 other things on your list every day, it can feel downright impossible at times. Too many women are lonely, unhappy, and looking for answers in all the wrong places: social media, local gossip, addiction, extramarital affairs, politics, perfectionism, busyness... Yet, we often neglect <i>ourselves</i> - the one thing we need most to keep everything else going! (How ironic.)</p>
<p>But how can we do better if we didn’t live better? Learn better? If we, ourselves, were victims of a harmful cycle and never learned how to love and care for ourselves? Many women suffer with anxiety, depression or PTSD from childhood and are put on strong prescription medications, often with uncomfortable or harmful side effects. But they aren't told that the bottle of pills and weekly therapy appointments aren't enough, nor are they offered additional resources for wellness.</p>
<p>We know that human connection is essential to optimal wellness and that people who practice regular self-care live happier, healthier lives. But where do we make these friends?</p>
<p>Where do we go when we live in a constant swirl of bottles and diapers and runny noses and skinned knees and busy schedules…? Who can we turn to if we have little to no family or friends available and we just need someone to hold the baby for an hour... Or to talk with someone about <u>anything</u> above preschool level...  Or to take 30 minutes of quiet to just breathe or read a book or dance our hearts out to our favorite song!?</p>
<p>How do we get and stay healthy when we can’t justify the cost of babysitting, combined with the price of gyms (and the fact that we just don’t enjoy traditional workouts)? Or if we don’t even realize just how much food and exercise impact our feelings? Or if we never learned healthy ways to release unhealthy emotions?</p>
<h3>What We Do at The ADM Studios</h3>
<p>My vision (and the goal of this project) is to create a comfortable and inviting space where women can come to fulfill all of these needs and more! A place where ladies can drop by for a fun fitness class at their convenience, hold a family event they can actually afford, or spend time regularly practicing self care with a community of women just like themselves. A community where women are empowered to see the best in themselves, break the destructive cycles of their past, and build the lives of their dreams.</p>

<h3>You Can Make A Difference</h3>
<p>Today we are pre-selling Club Memberships to help raise capital to open The ADM Studios in Oregon, Illinois. With your contribution to this campaign, not only will you get to be part of an incredible movement to inspire positive change in our community, but you'll also help a local family’s dream come true. We are on a mission to empower women to lead healthy, healed and happy lives and The ADM Studios gives us a place to do just that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for The ADM Studios to open for business, we need $2,500-$5,500 to help cover start-up costs and operating expenses for the first 6 months, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security Deposit, Rent &amp; Utilities</li>
<li>Business Insurance</li>
<li>Annual License, Certification &amp; Registration Fees</li>
<li>Studio/Office Management, &amp; Accounting Software</li>
<li>Website &amp; Marketing Expenses</li>
<li>Professional Services (i.e. accountant, attorney, etc)</li>
<li>Business/Office Supplies</li>
<li>Studio Equipment</li>
<li>Miscellaneous Business Expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>For each Pledge of Support, our Backers will receive a special ""Perk"" from The ADM Studios. Perks describe which Membership or other benefit you are purchasing today and when you can expect to receive it. {Check out what comes in each membership <a href=""https://theamericandreammakers.com/admstudios/rates/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">by clicking here</a>. Then, head back to the Home page to Select a Perk or click the pink button below to back our campaign.}</p>
<p>Our Campaign goal of $2,500-$5,000 will help us to get the business up and running. Any funds over this amount will be applied to initial operating costs. In the event that we do not reach this goal by our deadline, we will work to attain funding another way (i.e. traditional lending) so that we may still open the studio as planned. </p>

Hey, y’all! I'm Krystal Casey and I have a BIG vision! I'm on a mission to connect and empower women in our local communities through music, movement and meditation by introducing a new Dance & Wellness Center for Women - The ADM Studios! 
Why We Need The ADM Studios
How many times have you been wanting to get out of the house, but find yourself with nowhere to go? Let’s face it: life gets rough for all of us at times. Between caring for your spouse and/or your kids, work, school, balancing the household and the 243 other things on your list every day, it can feel downright impossible at times. Too many women are lonely, unhappy, and looking for answers in all the wrong places: social media, local gossip, addiction, extramarital affairs, politics, perfectionism, busyness... Yet, we often neglect ourselves - the one thing we need most to keep everything else going! (How ironic.)
But how can we do better if we didn’t live better? Learn better? If we, ourselves, were victims of a harmful cycle and never learned how to love and care for ourselves? Many women suffer with anxiety, depression or PTSD from childhood and are put on strong prescription medications, often with uncomfortable or harmful side effects. But they aren't told that the bottle of pills and weekly therapy appointments aren't enough, nor are they offered additional resources for wellness.
We know that human connection is essential to optimal wellness and that people who practice regular self-care live happier, healthier lives. But where do we make these friends?
Where do we go when we live in a constant swirl of bottles and diapers and runny noses and skinned knees and busy schedules…? Who can we turn to if we have little to no family or friends available and we just need someone to hold the baby for an hour... Or to talk with someone about anything above preschool level...  Or to take 30 minutes of quiet to just breathe or read a book or dance our hearts out to our favorite song!?
How do we get and stay healthy when we can’t justify the cost of babysitting, combined with the price of gyms (and the fact that we just don’t enjoy traditional workouts)? Or if we don’t even realize just how much food and exercise impact our feelings? Or if we never learned healthy ways to release unhealthy emotions?
What We Do at The ADM Studios
My vision (and the goal of this project) is to create a comfortable and inviting space where women can come to fulfill all of these needs and more! A place where ladies can drop by for a fun fitness class at their convenience, hold a family event they can actually afford, or spend time regularly practicing self care with a community of women just like themselves. A community where women are empowered to see the best in themselves, break the destructive cycles of their past, and build the lives of their dreams.
No treadmills. No scales. No judgment.

You Can Make A Difference
Today we are pre-selling Club Memberships to help raise capital to open The ADM Studios in Oregon, Illinois. With your contribution to this campaign, not only will you get to be part of an incredible movement to inspire positive change in our community, but you'll also help a local family’s dream come true. We are on a mission to empower women to lead healthy, healed and happy lives and The ADM Studios gives us a place to do just that.

What We Need & What You Get
In order for The ADM Studios to open for business, we need $2,500-$5,500 to help cover start-up costs and operating expenses for the first 6 months, such as:

Security Deposit, Rent & Utilities
Business Insurance
Annual License, Certification & Registration Fees
Studio/Office Management, & Accounting Software
Website & Marketing Expenses
Professional Services (i.e. accountant, attorney, etc)
Business/Office Supplies
Studio Equipment
Miscellaneous Business Expenses

For each Pledge of Support, our Backers will receive a special ""Perk"" from The ADM Studios. Perks describe which Membership or other benefit you are purchasing today and when you can expect to receive it. {Check out what comes in each membership by clicking here. Then, head back to the Home page to Select a Perk or click the pink button below to back our campaign.}
Our Campaign goal of $2,500-$5,000 will help us to get the business up and running. Any funds over this amount will be applied to initial operating costs. In the event that we do not reach this goal by our deadline, we will work to attain funding another way (i.e. traditional lending) so that we may still open the studio as planned. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Can't contribute right now? We've been there; we understand. But we can still use your help!

<p>Our story doesn’t begin with a dream to build a brewery. It begins in the 50’s, with a few families that started a community church in south Oak Cliff, and a handful of kids that sprouted out of that experience in the 70’s.</p>
<p>I’m a third-generation Oak Cliff native. My grandfather founded a small church near the corner of Hampton and Illinois, a pretty happening place at the time. El Fenix, Polar Bear Ice Cream, and the old Austin’s Barbeque were all within one block, and I still remember how, as a kid, I’d pass by the Astro Drive-in every day, trying to sneak a peek of the big screen. After college, I moved back to an Oak Cliff that had begun to change. It was a time of transition – the old community spots were closing down, and the heady revitalization of Bishop Arts and resurgence of interest in Oak Cliff had yet to gather momentum. Around that time, I met my lovely wife, another Oak Cliff native. We were married at Kessler Park United Methodist Church in the late 90’s and went off to start our family.</p>
<p>Through various transitions, no matter where we found ourselves living, we never strayed far from our Oak Cliff roots. With the growing development around Bishop Arts, we found ourselves crossing the Trinity less and less often… except when it came to craft breweries. So, in 2015, after about six years of brewing as a hobby, I got together with a few of those kids from the old church, and we decided to launch this brewery. There was never a question of what it would be called, or where it would go. It was always meant to be Oak Cliff Brewing Co.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507259895/lt1hfezvhq81ral5uptp.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>My father and uncles had followed in their father’s footsteps and became pastors, a path some thought I might take as well, but I opened a brewery instead. I didn’t set out or intend to go against the family grain, and I’m still active in my grandfather’s church, but, in searching for my calling, I found myself traversing a surprising and unconventional path.</p>
<p>I’ve spent the past 22 years building a career in software engineering, but I’ve instinctively known that my real calling was in a craft, something that could be shared with others. I dabbled in photography, built a woodworking shop, and in 2009, gave brewing beer a shot. I started sharing what I made with family and friends, and was inspired by the positive feedback. I began entering competitions like Brew Riot and Brewhaha to reach a wider audience and share my craft with more people; when we started picking up awards, I knew that this was what it was all about. I loved the process of brewing beer, but what I loved more than that was bringing people together to enjoy it. </p>

<p>We’re not brewing beer to start a new story. We’re brewing beer to rekindle an old story. Coming home to our roots in Oak Cliff.</p>
<p>This is why an integral part of our company’s mission is to support other missions and organizations working in South Dallas to uplift our community. Our weekly <i>Pint Nights</i> will dedicate $1 of every pint sold in the taproom to a local organization that we’ve partnered with. For our first partnership, we’ve chosen <a href=""http://www.bontonfarms.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bonton Farms</a>. In addition to weekly <i>Pint Night</i> proceeds,<strong> 10% of the proceeds for this campaign will go directly to Bonton Farms.</strong></p>
<p>Our passion to connect with the community is infused into all that we do. We want to help promote what we think is the best part of Dallas: Dallas’ Left Bank – Blue Collar Dallas – where the heart of the city truly beats. We want to show the world what a hidden gem Oak Cliff is, and bring jobs, events, interest, and a new gathering place for the community. Resisting the tide of big block development, we want to work with you and local entrepreneurs to bring Tyler Station to life as an icon of our history and symbol of our collective future.</p>

<p>Beer isn’t something constructed. Beer is the result of what happens when you create the right conditions for the right ingredients to come together, mingle, and flourish. The magic potential is all built into that single grain of barley. Community operates in much the same way. There’s an art to getting those conditions just right, and that’s what we hope to do with the brewery and taproom here at <a href=""http://www.tylerstation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tyler Station</a>.</p>
<p>The majority of the money raised by this campaign will go into revitalizing this building and opening up the brick walls as much as possible to let light wash through our space, and to visually connect with the DART rail passengers coming and going all day. In keeping with our values to stay true to the historic nature of this industrial site, we will work with our neighbors, <a href=""http://stashdesign.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stash Design</a>, to repurpose and upcycle as much of the old equipment and materials as possible to build out the taproom. We believe in the vision and our community, but we're asking for your help to make this vision a reality. We can’t do this alone – and truth be told, we don’t want to. We want to work together with you.</p>
<p>That’s what this campaign is all about. Investing not just in beer, not just in craft, but in a community. In a way of giving back to Oak Cliff, in connecting with our neighbors, in creating memories and shaping a new gathering place for generations to come. In dreaming of the future, and celebrating the history that made us who we are.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t be here without Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>We thought of all sorts of cool OCBC apparel and swag we could offer for perks, but when it comes down to it, this campaign is about sharing our craft and our community. We can't imagine a better way of doing that than by offering free beer in our taproom, right in the heart of Oak Cliff. It's a win-win deal, we get funds up front to finish out the taproom, and you get a free beer with every visit for a year or 99 to enjoy in this amazing space once we're open. </p>
<p>Ok, we couldn't resist, so we went ahead and made this cool 99 Years OCBC Founders tee.  Wear it proudly, and represent as one of the <i>Oak Cliff Brewing Society</i> 99ers!</p>

<p><strong>Q: What about the beer?</strong></p>
<p>Of course! That's the whole reason we're here! We'll be brewing on two different brewhouses, one is a 30 barrel (7,440 pints) production system, and the other is 3.5 barrel (868 pints) pilot system.  We'll use the production system for the year-round beers that you'll find in bars, restaurants, and stores around DFW – beers like our award-winning <strong>Black Lager</strong>, our crisp and bright <strong>Export Lager</strong>, and our assertive <strong>Red IPA</strong>.</p>
<p>The pilot system will feed the taproom with a constantly rotating set of taps.  It's our playground, where we'll brew everything from a <strong>Grapefruit Gose</strong> to an <strong>Imperial Stout</strong>. Maybe we'll do a <strong>Neighborhood IPA Series</strong>, where we feature a different variety of hop for different OC neighborhoods. We'll definitely brew the seasonals, like <strong>Saisons</strong>, <strong>Hefeweizens</strong>, <strong>Oktoberfests</strong> and <strong>Winter Warmers</strong> – some in the traditional style, and some with a twist. Our goal with the pilot system is that every time you visit, there'll be something new to try.</p>
<p><strong>Q: But is the beer going to be any good?</strong></p>
<p>Great question! We think you're going to love it, but for some more objective feedback, here are a few awards we've recently won at homebrewing festivals and competitions:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.brewriot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brew Riot</a> - May 2016</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Overall - Lager - <strong>Black Lager</strong>

<p>We don't take our entry into the DFW craft beer market lightly. There are some amazing beers being brewed in the area, and we want to ensure that the beers we're bringing to market will only strengthen the reputation of craft brewing in North Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you tell me more about Bonton Farms?</strong></p>
<p>Bonton Farms works in a South Dallas community just a little ways east of us that’s classified as a food desert. Their work in strengthening community bonds, growing healthy food, providing jobs and job training, and so much more is best summed in their mission to restore lives and ignite hope. If you'd like to dig further into the great work they're doing here in South Dallas, or even get your own hands dirty helping out, be sure to look them up at <a href=""http://www.bontonfarms.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bontonfarms.org</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What's with the one-per-day limit on my free beer?</strong></p>
<p>Texas law explicitly forbids any deals or promotions that encourage excessive consumption, so to steer far clear of that we'll only be able to pour one free pint per day.  Always drink responsibly!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is the free beer always a pint?</strong></p>
<p>Taproom pints will be 16-ounce pours, though the 99-year tankards hold closer to 20 ounces. For most beers, that'll be your daily free pour. For higher gravity, barrel aged, or specialty beers that we serve in smaller portions, you'll have the option to exchange one of your free pint or tankard fills for one of these smaller portion beers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When does my membership begin and the free beer start flowing?</strong></p>
<p>Memberships in the <i>Oak Cliff Brewing Society</i> will begin the day of our public grand opening. We're shooting for March on that, but it's subject to change by a month or so.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is the membership transferrable, either the annual or the 99-year one?</strong></p>
<p>We can do a one-time transfer of your membership to someone else, but you'll need to contact us to get that approved and done.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I bequeath my 99-year membership to someone else in my will?</strong></p>
<p>Beer in your will? What a brilliant idea! Yes, that could count as your one-time transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How will you track my membership?</strong></p>
<p>We'll provide you an <i>Oak Cliff Brewing Society</i> membership card. Show it every time you're in the taproom for your free beer. It's that easy!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I take my free beer with me?</strong></p>
<p>As the saying goes... you can't take it with you. All free beers must be consumed on premise in our Oak Cliff taproom.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does the 99 Year tankard look like?</strong></p>
<p>Here it is from start to finish; in the raw, glazed and waiting to be fired at 2350 F, and the final product.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513645018/qjvgonswam2fvlpbllnv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There's supposedly a short video clip of the pot being formed on the wheel.  We haven't found it yet, but we're pretty sure it plays like the pottery scene from Ghost. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I tank my tankard home with me?</strong></p>
<p>We'd like to keep these all lined up at the brewery, eagerly awaiting your next visit and drawing envious admiration from everyone else, but we'll let you take it home if you like.</p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Q: What if my one-of-a-kind 99 Year tankard breaks or is lost?</strong></p>
<p>No fear! Our pottery artist, <a href=""https://www.oakcliffpottery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oak Cliff Pottery</a>, is just down the street from the brewery, so he'll be able to craft you another one.  You'll just need to help with the replacement cost, which is around $50 in current day value... no telling how much it'll be in 99 years with inflation!</p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Q: What happens on my 99th anniversary in the 99 Year club?</strong></p>
<p>On your 99th anniversary with us, we'll shut down the taproom and throw a massive party for you and 99 of your closest friends!  Then your free beer will expire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507259993/sp0a7iqgcfgoft62drzw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>While we certainly hope you'll be able to help us out and take advantage of this offering, we know money doesn't grow on trees! If you can't contribute right now, we'd still love your support in getting the word out. Some of the ways you can help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tell your family and friends</strong> about our campaign.</li>
<li>
<strong>Give our 99 Years of Free Beer a shout out on social media</strong>.  You can use the links at the top of the page to share this campaign on Facebook and Twitter.</li>

Memberships in the Oak Cliff Brewing Society will begin the day of our public grand opening. We're shooting for March on that, but it's subject to change by a month or so.
Q: Is the membership transferrable, either the annual or the 99-year one?
We can do a one-time transfer of your membership to someone else, but you'll need to contact us to get that approved and done.
Q: Can I bequeath my 99-year membership to someone else in my will?
Beer in your will? What a brilliant idea! Yes, that could count as your one-time transfer.
Q: How will you track my membership?
We'll provide you an Oak Cliff Brewing Society membership card. Show it every time you're in the taproom for your free beer. It's that easy!
Q: Can I take my free beer with me?
As the saying goes... you can't take it with you. All free beers must be consumed on premise in our Oak Cliff taproom.
Q: What does the 99 Year tankard look like?
Here it is from start to finish; in the raw, glazed and waiting to be fired at 2350 F, and the final product.

There's supposedly a short video clip of the pot being formed on the wheel.  We haven't found it yet, but we're pretty sure it plays like the pottery scene from Ghost. 
Q: Can I tank my tankard home with me?
We'd like to keep these all lined up at the brewery, eagerly awaiting your next visit and drawing envious admiration from everyone else, but we'll let you take it home if you like.
Q: What if my one-of-a-kind 99 Year tankard breaks or is lost?
No fear! Our pottery artist, Oak Cliff Pottery, is just down the street from the brewery, so he'll be able to craft you another one.  You'll just need to help with the replacement cost, which is around $50 in current day value... no telling how much it'll be in 99 years with inflation!
Q: What happens on my 99th anniversary in the 99 Year club?
On your 99th anniversary with us, we'll shut down the taproom and throw a massive party for you and 99 of your closest friends!  Then your free beer will expire.
 

While we certainly hope you'll be able to help us out and take advantage of this offering, we know money doesn't grow on trees! If you can't contribute right now, we'd still love your support in getting the word out. Some of the ways you can help us:

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We met and became friends at Luther College in Decorah, IA. That’s where we first started imagining a place where you could go to sip on a beer while you work, study, or read a good book. When we returned to the Twin Cities after graduation and couldn’t find a place like this that already existed, we decided to create it ourselves</p>
<p>Quite simply, Cream &amp; Amber will be a place for those who share our passion for books and beer - that’s why we are so excited to involve all of you in our crowdfunding campaign. Your contributions will help us bring to life a space that blends your favorite coffee shop/bookstore vibes with the community of the craft beer scene. As we bring our vision to life, our commitment to you is to listen, build relationships, and create the space that you want to experience.</p>
<p><strong>Join us and give now to help make Cream &amp; Amber the best space it can possibly be  - cheers to reading, craft beer, and you!</strong></p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our most significant expense in opening Cream &amp; Amber is the design and construction cost associated with building our kitchen and bar space. Our goal with this crowdfunding campaign is to raise $20,000 in order to help cover a portion of these costs. The money you contribute to this campaign will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architect costs (design and creation of construction documents) - $9,000</li>
<li>Kitchen and bar equipment/construction - $8,000</li>
<li>Furniture and bookshelves - $3,000</li>
</ul>
<p>We have several wonderful rewards to share with you when you contribute to our campaign! You can be among the first to use a Cream &amp; Amber <u><strong>pint glass</strong></u> (which comes with a free fill upon opening) or the first to sport a Cream &amp; Amber <u><strong>t-shirt or sweatshirt.</strong></u></p>
<p>For those that are looking for more than SWAG, we also want to share experiences with you! Our higher level contributors will be invited to an exclusive <strong><u>launch party,</u></strong> get special use of our <u><strong>community room</strong></u> after opening, or become members of our <u><strong>Cream &amp; Amber Collective</strong></u> (free coffee for life!).</p>
<p><i>That’s not all </i>- keep your eyes peeled for a few surprises as our campaign progresses!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want you to feel like you belong when you come into Cream and Amber, whether you are there to socialize or tuck yourself away in the corner with a good book. We plan to make the space inviting, relaxing, and comfortable. Your contributions will help us make this vision a reality, and it will also help ensure that we are meeting all the necessary city, county, and department of health regulations.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to Cream &amp; Amber being a part of the community in Hopkins. We love the people, we love Mainstreet, and we love the feel of the city! We are pretty excited about the potential events and partnerships with other local businesses, and your contributions to our campaign will help ensure that we can build a lasting space and be part of the community for many years to come.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>You may think we are a little crazy for trying to open a bookstore in this day and age. However, not only are independent bookstores on the rise (Google it if you don’t believe us), but we firmly believe that bookstores are creative spaces that encourage imagination, ingenuity, and learning, and that they will always be an indispensable part of the community.</p>
<p>In addition to selling books, we plan to host events such as author readings, tap takeovers, craft/DIY workshops, and more. Plus, our community room will be the perfect place for you to gather your book club! Although selling books is one of our main focuses, we also envision ourselves as a gathering place, which will help us remain financially viable. And of course, we plan to keep rotating craft beers on tap so that you can come back and try new beers from local breweries!</p>

<h3>A Short History</h3>
<p>Local Bend resident, Cassie Clemans, opened Roundabout Books in the fall of 2016.  Our first year was a whirlwind of learning and growing as we settled into the Northwest Crossing Community. We're proud to say that in our second year we grew sales by 12%, hosted over 160 events attended by over 1,500 people, welcomed dozens of community groups and clubs to use our space, and donated to more than 24 school groups, community fundraisers, and non-profit organizations. Today we support ten monthly book clubs that are open to the entire community. None of this would be possible without your support. Thank you.</p>
<p>Though Roundabout Books has had a wonderful start, the upfront costs of opening a new bookstore and cafe are considerable, and we're determined to pay off our Small Business Association (SBA) Loan this year.  In order to open the store in 2016, Cassie contributed 50% of the total funding, and obtained an SBA Loan for the other 50%. The loan served it's purpose by helping us finance the bookcases and opening inventory. However, last year 14% of our gross margin earnings were spent on loan repayments, making it one of our three largest expenses. In an industry of razor-thin margins, these payments stifle our ability to grow.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>By paying off the loan in 2019, we save over $60K in interest though the term of the loan, we free up much needed monthly cash flow for inventory growth</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>, and we give the store an opportunity to become self-supporting by the end of Year Three.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Breaking it Down</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We hope to raise the funds needed to pay off the loan in 2019 through three avenues:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 from an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign running 2/1/19-3/20/19</li>
<li>1/3 from a corporate sponsor who is matching all Indiegogo donations</li>
<li>1/3 from additional principal loan payments in 2019</li>

<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>There is a perk for every campaign contribution level, ranging from a free coffee to a lifetime discount at our store, and every donation of $50 or more receives a 25% OFF Purchase coupon. We are also giving away our exclusive Roundabout Books Hydro Flask reusable bottles. In January 2019, we launched a <a href=""https://www.roundaboutbookshop.com/caf%C3%A9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#treadlightly</a> campaign with the goal of eliminating all single use materials from our cafe.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The early years of any small business are critical, and it's incredibly important that we break even this year. We are working on other ways to reduce expenses and grow our sales, but paying off this loan will have an immediate and permanent effect on the future of our bookshop.</p>
<p>Books have small margins, and it takes a lot of book sales each month to meet the expenses of a new brick and mortar shop.  We understand that many people love having our shop in the community but don't normally buy books for their households.

<p><strong><u>Enchantée !</u></strong></p>
<p>I’m Kay, 49, British, born in Hong Kong to an Irish father and Macanese mother, raised between Asia and the UK and living in Paris since 1990.</p>
<p>The advantage of having such an disjointed childhood and mixed heritage is that (i) its easier to pick up languages (ii) you don’t feel tied to any particular place, which is why I probably found it so easy to move somewhere completely unfamiliar when I reached adulthood.</p>
<p>I set up my first company in 1993 at the age of 23. Pachyderme started off by representing British lighting designers in France and French lighting designers in Britain. It has grown over the years to representing lighting manufacturers from different countries, clients throughout the world (shops, department stores, interior architects) and its own showroom in Paris.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536261745/asspqvq2opedeqqypmug.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I love my job and am still passionate about lighting and decoration as a whole, however, after 25 years of Pachyderme I feel like a new challenge.</p>
<p>About 2 years ago I started renting a weekend house in a part of Normandy known as the Pays de Caux : a glorious region which boasts cliffs and beaches, as well as lush countryside, not to mention Neuchâtel cheese and calvados.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536261917/kjhacnas7s5yg9gzimy2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It was there that I contracted a strange and apparently incurable disease known in the local vernacular as ‘le syndrome du chineur compulsif’. Symptoms include rising at the crack of dawn to scout the innumerable boot and house clearance sales that mushroom on weekends and during summer. Or having to enter every single thrift and charity shop on your way to ANYWHERE. Sufferers experiencing an acute form of the illness tend to spend hours on the internet, after the sales have closed, in a never-ending quest for treasures whether they be furniture, art, tableware, clothing, curiosities or collectibles.</p>

<p>Fortunately I have been able to turn my affliction into a money-making venture. However, I have been using Pachyderme to trade my vintage finds up to now, which is not ideal and the time has come for Treasures &amp; Old Tat to leave the nest and fly with its own wings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>The Project :</u></strong></p>
<p>To begin with, I really need a dedicated website which will include the following features</p>
<ul><li>The possibility of ordering any piece of vintage furniture on sale in a range of finishes and seeing the result online at a click. I work with an artist who uses Annie Sloan’s chalk paints which are GREAT for revamping and breathing new life into old pieces.</li></ul>

<ul><li>A ‘Pimp my Piece’ section which enables clients to send us photos of their OWN furniture that they would like to have renovated and receive a quote for the makeover including collection and delivery.</li></ul>
<p>There is a real demand for this type of service as it is customary in France for older generations to pass on furniture and heirlooms to the younger generation who then find themselves in the dilemma of not knowing how to fit a carved-oak Gothic cabinet into their white designer living room, yet unable to throw the thing out owing to sentimental attachment.</p>
<ul>
<li>A subscription which will entitle you to a monthly goody bag of vintage finds<br/> </li>
<li>English, Chinese and Japanese versions to reach a truly global market</li>
</ul>
<p>The best quote I have received for a developing and online store and visual identity is <strong>5000 E </strong>(this does not include translation which I can have done later on, launching in French and English which I can do myself)</p>
<p>Secondly, or rather, simultaneously I would like to open a store in Paris where clients can come and browse vintage, chat vintage and even drink tea (or wine, depending on the time of day) in vintage cups and glasses.</p>
<p>Over 50 % of my enquiries are from the Parisian region. Actually the beauty of my set up is that Normandy where I spend half my time provides me with up to 80 % of my inventory and I then deliver this to my clients when I go back to Paris.</p>
<p>However, there are still the hesitant and the indecisive who will always prefer to see and touch before buying. And, truth be told, I actually enjoy the human contact and meeting new people, and am certain that having a physical space would boost my business considerably. It’s incredible how many lovely people I have encountered and become friends with through my vintage addiction. It’s not just the object that attracts us per se, but the whole history it tells about how people used to live, and the tastes and technology of the time.</p>
<p>After a long and winding search, I have found the store of my dreams (and budget !) :</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536262116/zkt0hr8kdkgpyfmomcf3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>a 60 m2 (700 ft2) space at the foot of a beautiful mid-20<sup>th</sup> Century residential brick building in an upwardly-mobile yet still authentic part of Paris (20<sup>th</sup> arrondissement).</p>
<p>The property features 3m-high ceilings (10 ft) and great light. The rear entrance leads onto the courtyard where there is a small but well kept garden (I can already see the cocktail glasses hovering amongst the plants …).</p>
<p>The premises have great potential and great energy but it is not going to be cheap (hence the great deal) ….</p>
<ul>
<li>The plumbing is non-existent. The toilet is in the courtyard, which is fine as I will be the only person using it. But it is a Turkish ‘squat’ model that needs to be adapted to the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. I also want to set up a small kitchen so as to be able to show some hospitality to my visitors and organise the occasional cocktail party.<br/> </li>
<li>The electricity needs a complete makeover and I also need to install a special ceiling system to exhibit chandeliers.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>I know exactly how I would like to decorate the interior : bespoke cement tiles from Chettinad in Southern India (famous for its splendid 19<sup>th</sup> Century mansions), which I will also be proposing on sale,  and light grey tadelak on the walls to create an overall neutral-mineral background in contrast to my often baroque and colourful vintage wonders.<br/>​</p>

<p>I am extremely fortunate in knowing some gifted craftsmen who have offered their services to me at rock-bottom prices as, not only do they wish to support my project, they hope to gain business through the shop which will function as a showcase for their work.</p>
<p>The whole makeover is going to cost in the region of <strong>25 000</strong> Euros :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>5000</strong> Euros for electricity, ceiling rails and electric heaters</li>
<li>
<strong>14 000</strong> Euros for walls, floor and ceiling</li>
<li>
<strong>2000</strong> Euros for plumbing</li>
<li>
<strong>3000</strong> Euros for woodwork (building a large cupboard,  laying floorboards in the cellar, repairing existing doors and windows)</li>
<li>
<strong>1000</strong> Euros for just in case !</li>
</ul>
<p>I have <strong>10 000</strong> Euros in savings to put towards the website and renovation of the store, so am short of <strong>20 000</strong> Euros, hence my campaign on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to be able to finance both projects as they really go hand in hand.</p>
<p>I realise it is a large amount to ask, and would never have dared to do so without putting a significant amount of my own money into this campaign.</p>
<p>I will also make sure that any investment you choose to make is worth your while (see PERKS below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>How Can you Help ?</u></strong></p>
<p>Before I launched my own campaign, I must have read over 50 others to get an idea of how the system works and how to present myself. There are SO MANY interesting projects on this site, so many creative people and impressive (and sometimes hilarious) presentations. I wanted to invest in them ALL, myself ! But first I have to concentrate on my own …</p>
<p>So why choose to support Treasures and Old Tat ?</p>
<p>Well, firstly maybe because you are a vintage junkie like myself and can totally identify with my adventure.</p>
<p>Or, maybe you are a Francophile and interested in all things French.</p>
<p>Whatever your motivation, please know that I will put your contribution to the best possible use. I am no stranger to hard work and the fact that Pachyderme is still running after 25 years is testimony itself to the fact that I must be doing something right.</p>
<p>As for the challenges ahead, I do not underestimate them in the least, however, my 2 mottos in life are : (i) what does not kill you makes you stronger (ii) the Chinese ideogram for disaster is the same for opportunity.</p>
<p>In funding my campaign, you will not only be helping me, but ultimately providing jobs for all the people involved in getting the project off the ground and, hopefully, as I expand, for a shop assistant and community manager.</p>
<p>You will also be contributing to a business that recycles products and breathes new life into what may very well have ended up in the dumpster otherwise !</p>

</div></div>","Enchantée !
I’m Kay, 49, British, born in Hong Kong to an Irish father and Macanese mother, raised between Asia and the UK and living in Paris since 1990.
The advantage of having such an disjointed childhood and mixed heritage is that (i) its easier to pick up languages (ii) you don’t feel tied to any particular place, which is why I probably found it so easy to move somewhere completely unfamiliar when I reached adulthood.
I set up my first company in 1993 at the age of 23. Pachyderme started off by representing British lighting designers in France and French lighting designers in Britain. It has grown over the years to representing lighting manufacturers from different countries, clients throughout the world (shops, department stores, interior architects) and its own showroom in Paris.

I love my job and am still passionate about lighting and decoration as a whole, however, after 25 years of Pachyderme I feel like a new challenge.
About 2 years ago I started renting a weekend house in a part of Normandy known as the Pays de Caux : a glorious region which boasts cliffs and beaches, as well as lush countryside, not to mention Neuchâtel cheese and calvados.

It was there that I contracted a strange and apparently incurable disease known in the local vernacular as ‘le syndrome du chineur compulsif’. Symptoms include rising at the crack of dawn to scout the innumerable boot and house clearance sales that mushroom on weekends and during summer. Or having to enter every single thrift and charity shop on your way to ANYWHERE. Sufferers experiencing an acute form of the illness tend to spend hours on the internet, after the sales have closed, in a never-ending quest for treasures whether they be furniture, art, tableware, clothing, curiosities or collectibles.

Fortunately I have been able to turn my affliction into a money-making venture. However, I have been using Pachyderme to trade my vintage finds up to now, which is not ideal and the time has come for Treasures & Old Tat to leave the nest and fly with its own wings.
 
The Project :
To begin with, I really need a dedicated website which will include the following features
The possibility of ordering any piece of vintage furniture on sale in a range of finishes and seeing the result online at a click. I work with an artist who uses Annie Sloan’s chalk paints which are GREAT for revamping and breathing new life into old pieces.
​

A ‘Pimp my Piece’ section which enables clients to send us photos of their OWN furniture that they would like to have renovated and receive a quote for the makeover including collection and delivery.
There is a real demand for this type of service as it is customary in France for older generations to pass on furniture and heirlooms to the younger generation who then find themselves in the dilemma of not knowing how to fit a carved-oak Gothic cabinet into their white designer living room, yet unable to throw the thing out owing to sentimental attachment.

A subscription which will entitle you to a monthly goody bag of vintage finds 
English, Chinese and Japanese versions to reach a truly global market

The best quote I have received for a developing and online store and visual identity is 5000 E (this does not include translation which I can have done later on, launching in French and English which I can do myself)
Secondly, or rather, simultaneously I would like to open a store in Paris where clients can come and browse vintage, chat vintage and even drink tea (or wine, depending on the time of day) in vintage cups and glasses.
Over 50 % of my enquiries are from the Parisian region. Actually the beauty of my set up is that Normandy where I spend half my time provides me with up to 80 % of my inventory and I then deliver this to my clients when I go back to Paris.
However, there are still the hesitant and the indecisive who will always prefer to see and touch before buying. And, truth be told, I actually enjoy the human contact and meeting new people, and am certain that having a physical space would boost my business considerably. It’s incredible how many lovely people I have encountered and become friends with through my vintage addiction. It’s not just the object that attracts us per se, but the whole history it tells about how people used to live, and the tastes and technology of the time.
After a long and winding search, I have found the store of my dreams (and budget !) :
 

a 60 m2 (700 ft2) space at the foot of a beautiful mid-20th Century residential brick building in an upwardly-mobile yet still authentic part of Paris (20th arrondissement).

I am extremely fortunate in knowing some gifted craftsmen who have offered their services to me at rock-bottom prices as, not only do they wish to support my project, they hope to gain business through the shop which will function as a showcase for their work.
The whole makeover is going to cost in the region of 25 000 Euros :


5000 Euros for electricity, ceiling rails and electric heaters

14 000 Euros for walls, floor and ceiling

2000 Euros for plumbing

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Invisible Majority was launched in January 2015 by Mia Loving and Blaqstarr. Our vision was to provide space and services that connected Baltimore's very silo'ed artist community while increasing access and visibility to the most underrepresented artists.</p>
<p>In this 5 years we've produced 3 festivals, produced and sponsored dozens of events, provided opportunities for hundreds of micro-businesses and worked with a wide array of artists to help move closer to their goals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Over the last 5 years we've expressed the importance of space. In addition to establishing our own spaces, we partnered with prominent spaces. <strong>We're excited for the next leg of our journey and that is launching a retail store that carries the unique work of independent artists of Baltimore and beyond. </strong></p>
<p>Invisible Majority has always been about forging new paths and providing space for those that usually don't have it which isn't an easy path.  We are looking for community investors to help support and sustainability of the Invisible Majority Store. We plan to officially launch on our 5th anniversary January 15, 2020. </p>
<p><strong>We need funds for: </strong></p>
<p><strong>* More retail equipment and furniture</strong></p>
<p><strong>* Store signage &amp; decorations</strong></p>
<p><strong>* Invisible Majority specific merchandise</strong></p>
<p><strong>* First few months of rent, utilities and insurance</strong></p>
<p><strong>* PR support</strong></p>
<p>What you get in return: </p>
<p>* Supporting a business that you will have multiple ways to benefit from</p>
<p>* Access to discounts on space, products, events and services</p>
<p>* Public acknowledgement and promotion of your work</p>
<p>*Entry to upcoming fundraising events</p>
<p>* Return on investment for contributions above $1500</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>November 2019 we worked with Books by Nikiea, Aaron Maybin Art and Vision2Life Services to curate the Invisible Majority Stage at Brilliant Baltimore. We were the 1st Black-owned business to curate a programming stage at the Baltimore Book Festival. We hosted panels, performances, and signings featuring Black self published authors and writers. We had retail space that sold the books of dozens of authors.</p>
<p>Many of the featured authors and patrons alike expressed the need for a space like this and a desire to support something like that on an ongoing basis. Many asked if we  had a physical location they could visit. It's that and years of working with micro-businesses that gave the final push to make this a reality. </p>
<p>Imagine a space that consistently supports underrepresented artists and creators with retail space, events, workshops, office rental and mailbox availability. A true incubator that helps these businesses  level up in their process. </p>
<p>Why are we committed to this? Because supporting creative entrepreneurs and micro-businesses contributes to economic equity and in a city like Baltimore with high poverty rates directly linked to systematic racism, this is even more important. </p>

<p>Echo Bravo will offer similar popular events and drinks that are currently featured at Kilo Bravo and will add a larger weekend brunch menu and karaoke parties to the schedule.  The new location is located in Bushwick, BK  at 445 Troutman Street and features a great front patio for prime outdoor seating fun.  </p>

<p>Should we not reach our funding goal in time or fail to open Echo Bravo at this location, we will honor the perks through our original Bravo Bar, Kilo Bravo, and reserve whatever funds we raised for a second Bravo location in the future.</p>

<p>As a fledgling bar, Kilo Bravo quickly recognized the need to be flexible and was able to navigate the struggles new businesses face by quickly adapting to the neighborhood's wants and needs.  We plan to enter into Echo Bravo having learned from the formidable years of Kilo Bravo.   We will operate with open ears for what the Echo Bravo customer might further enjoy and willingly adapt!</p>

Zentrums für Selbst-Kultivierung. Selbst-Kultivierung ist ein Begriff aus
dem Alten China der Chinesisch Xiulian heißt. Er beinhaltet vieles, was heute
in Teilen des Qigongs enthalten ist, ebenso in den Chinesisch - philosophischen
Schulen des Konfuzianismus, Daoismus, Buddhismus wie auch der Chinesischen
Medizin. Genau genommen ist es eine der Grundlagen der Chinesischen Medizin an
sich. Durch Xiulian lernen wir (wieder) unser Leben selbst zu gestalten!</p>
<p>Die
Idee zur Gründung dieses Zentrums für Selbst-Kultivierungskünste basiert auf
meinen Erfahrungen und dem erlernten Wissen aus den letzten 32 Jahren, in denen
ich mich mit der chinesischen Kultur befasst habe, was insbesondere die Künste
des Taijiquan, Shaolinquan, des Qigong, des Daoyin, der Chinesischen Medizin,
der Teekultur, Daoismus, uvm. betrifft. Meine Erfahrungen aus rund 25 Jahren
Unterrichtstätigkeit in diesen Künsten runden das Ganze weiter ab.</p>

<p><b>Create Your own life!</b></p>
<p>This project involves the establishment of a
center for self-cultivation. Self-Cultivation which originates from Ancient
China, named<span>  Xiulian. It contains a lot
of what we find today in different parts of Qigong and also in the three great
Chinese philosophical schools of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and in Chinese
Medicine. In fact it is one of the foundations of Chinese Medicine in itself.
Through Xiulian we are able to learn creating our own lives!</span></p>
<p>The idea of establishing this <i>Center of Self
Cultivation Arts</i> is based on my very own experiences and acquired knowledge
from the past 32 years, in which I have engaged myself in the Chinese culture.
Especially in the arts of Taijiquan, Shaolinquan, Qigong, Daoyin, Chinese
Medicine, Tea Culture, Daoism and many more. My experiences in teaching my
knowledge of 25 years makes my qualification for this project complete.</p>

<p><b>Warum ist dies
wichtig und für was wird gespendet?</b></p>
<p><b>Wissen und Übungsmethoden für Alle!</b></p>
<p>Ich möchte mit diesem Projekt einerseits,
allen Interessierten einen Platz geben, um sich mit den Methoden und den
Hintergründen der Selbst-Kultivierung beschäftigen zu können. Dies geschieht bspw. durch das
Erlernen praktischer Übungen in der Art von bewegten Formen, meditativen
Praktiken, Lesen relevanter Texte und Klassiker und Verinnerlichung dieser, und
vielem mehr. Deren Umsetzung in den Alltag hat hierbei höchste Priorität.</p>
<p>Das
Wissen hierzu stammt einerseits aus der Literatur der Chinesischen Medizin,
Philosophie, Kampfkunst, etc. Zum Anderen wird es aus verschiedenen Linien
bezogen in denen ich bisher lernen durfte und auch weiterhin lernen darf,
(bspw. die Huatuomen Linie, die Mao Shan Linie der daoistischen Elixierschule,
usw.) aus denen mir die Meister dieser Überlieferungstraditionen riesige
Schätze Alten Wissens zur Verfügung stellen welche ich durch das Zentrum gerne
mit anderen Menschen teilen möchte.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Why is this
important and what is donated?</b></p>
<p><b>Knowledge and practice methods for All!</b></p>
<p>Through this project I want to give all
interested parties an opportunity to get to know the methods and their settings
of the Self Cultivation. You are able to achieve this by learning practical
exercises in the way of moving forms, meditative practices, reading and
internalizing relevant texts and classics. The highest priority is the
implementation into everyday life.</p>
<p>The Knowledge of all these different aspects is
based on studying Chinese Medicine, philosophy and martial arts literature.
Recently my prospect expanded through my involvement in various lines, in which
I was previously able to learn and still do (eg. the Huatuomen line, the Mao
Shan line of Taoist Elixir school, etc.). My masters of this traditions make
these huge treasures of old knowledge available and i would like<span>  to share them with other people with the aid
of the center.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>Forscher und Meister</b></p>
<p>Zum Anderen möchte ich durch meine Kontakte zu
Meistern, einiger sehr alter Praxislinien, die jeweiligen Traditionen in diesem
Zentrum zusammen kommen lassen, um die Schätze der Alten chinesischen Kultur zu
bergen und<span>  allen Menschen zugänglich
machen. Hierzu wird es im Zentrum einen eigenen Forschungsbereich geben, an dem
weitere befreundete Sinologen, Mediziner, Meister und Großmeister
zusammenarbeiten und entsprechende Ergebnisse bzw. Literatur in Zukunft veröffentlichen
können.</span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p><b>Researchers and Master</b></p>
<p>Additionally I strive to bring together these
particular traditions of this<span>  center to
unearth the tresasures of Ancient Chinese Culture and making this accessible to
all people. My various contacts to masters of very old practice line will make
me able to do so. For this purpose a research area will be established in the
center where through the collaboration of several college sinologists, doctors,
masters and grandmasters  results and
outcomes will be published. <br/></span></p>

<p><b>Wie sehen die
weiteren Schritte aus?</b></p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>Schritt</p>
<p>Um das ganze auf eine sichere Grundlage stellen
zu können bedarf es einer Firmengründung im Sinne einer Company bzw. Enterprise.
Der Hauptsitz wird
in Taiwan sein. Hierzu dient diese erste Kampagne. Sollte
ein Überschuss aus dieser Kampagne bzgl. der finanziellen Mittel entstehen so
können die weiteren Schritte schon früher begonnen werden.</p>
<p><span>2.<span>  </span></span>Schritt</p>
<p>Nach der Gründung werden Räume benötigt die
entsprechend groß sind, um das ganze so zu realisieren, dass es möglich ist,
Kurse und Retreats vor Ort abhalten zu können bzw. Reisen nach Taiwan zu
ermöglichen, bei denen langfristig gesehen, auch Übernachtungen möglich sind.
Räume werden benötigt für</p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>Unterricht</p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>Bewegungskünste wie Daoyin, Kampfkünste, etc.</p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>Präventive Maßnahmen und Therapie (Aus- und Fortbildung)</p>

<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>Falls möglich Gästezimmer, Küche und Mensa</p>
<p>Die Räumlichkeiten dienen in erster Linie zur

<p>
</p>
<p><b>What are
the next steps?</b></p>
<p>Step
1</p>
<p>In
order to implement this idea we need to establish a company or enterprise. The
headquarters are going to be in Taiwan. If there should a occur an excess out
of this campaign in regards of financial sources perpetuating steps can be
initiated.</p>
<p>Step
2</p>
<p>After
the founding premises are needed which are sufficiently large in order to
realize the whole so that it is possible to hold courses and retreats on site
or to allow travel to Taiwan, which in the long run, even overnight stays are
possible. Facilities are required for</p>

Create Your own life!
This project involves the establishment of a
center for self-cultivation. Self-Cultivation which originates from Ancient
China, named  Xiulian. It contains a lot
of what we find today in different parts of Qigong and also in the three great
Chinese philosophical schools of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and in Chinese
Medicine. In fact it is one of the foundations of Chinese Medicine in itself.
Through Xiulian we are able to learn creating our own lives!
The idea of establishing this Center of Self
Cultivation Arts is based on my very own experiences and acquired knowledge
from the past 32 years, in which I have engaged myself in the Chinese culture.
Especially in the arts of Taijiquan, Shaolinquan, Qigong, Daoyin, Chinese
Medicine, Tea Culture, Daoism and many more. My experiences in teaching my

Das

bezogen in denen ich bisher lernen durfte und auch weiterhin lernen darf,
(bspw. die Huatuomen Linie, die Mao Shan Linie der daoistischen Elixierschule,
usw.) aus denen mir die Meister dieser Überlieferungstraditionen riesige
Schätze Alten Wissens zur Verfügung stellen welche ich durch das Zentrum gerne
mit anderen Menschen teilen möchte.

We serve over 250 low income individuals per year in the shelter, and additionally over 4,500 through the crisis line, Speakers Bureau and no-fee Community Outreach Program.<p></p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW</strong></p>
<p>As many people know funding for non-profits have been decreasing since the recession hit in 2008. The direct impact it has had on shelters is devastating, short of closing our doors we have had to reduce staffing, cut programs, and often rely on the kindness of our community to provide donations to support us. Ruby’s Place has lost $70,000 in funding the last two years due to a funders change in focus. This directly impacted our children’s program which focuses on the intervention of abuse, early intervention for healing from trauma and family counseling. As a result,  this program lost a full time therapist and we had to combine programs in order to continue to provide these services.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOUR DONATION WILL DO</strong></p>
<p>Funding from donors like you will go directly to supporting the families we serve. Donations pay for food, bedding, therapy sessions, books and supplies for the children, art therapy supplies, emergency transportation for clients in a dangerous home, the 24 hour crisis line, or a DV support group facilitator.</p>
<p><strong>THE ISSUE</strong></p>
<p>Domestic violence affects all families across the world, every social economic status, every race, gender and ethnicity. We serve wives and children of doctors, police officers and politicians. We also serve the wives and children of gang members and drug dealers. <strong><em>1 in 4 women will be affected by domestic violence</em></strong>. That means that 1 in 4 women in YOUR life will be touched by abuse. Our clients are not weak or un-resourceful, they are scared but strong women.</p>
<p><strong>WHO WE SERVE</strong></p>
<p>Participants in the program consist of mothers and children ages 0-18 who are current or former residents of Ruby’s Place. Services including individual and group counseling, parent consultation, structured play groups, and after-school support are available to all families upon admission to the shelter. Healing from trauma is often a long and difficult process, therefore children and families are offered aftercare services that extend beyond their stay and successful transition to permanent housing. Aftercare services are provided to clients in their residences, via telephone or at Ruby’s Place adjacent therapy center.</p>
<p>Families arrive at the shelter after having been exposed to an array of traumatic events. They often experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, and behavioral problems. To identify areas of concern, the staff conducts a comprehensive assessment upon intake. Mental health services, case management/advocacy, and community referrals are offered to each family based on its unique set of emotional, physical, and behavioral needs.</p>
<p> We provide quality service and a safe place for women and children no matter what time of day or night. </p>
<p>Last year 83% of our clients came to our facility due to a violent crime and 17% due to non-violent homelessness. The high populations of women that we serve are victims of domestic violence and have no support system, are financially unstable due to victimization and mental health issues, all due to severe trauma. Many of the women are victimized and controlled due to their legal status or lack of language skills. Immigration status creates barriers for restraining orders, social services, housing and education. The families are limited in knowledge as to what their rights are and how to advocate for themselves. When it comes to legal issues the process is often long, confusing and expensive. Again, the families are often misinformed or scared to involve law enforcement due to immigration status, threats or otherwise.</p>
</div><p><strong>THE CHILDREN SUFFER TOO</strong></p><p>Out of the 245 unduplicated clients we served, 153 were children.

<p>Are you tired of seeing the typical 6ft tall size 2 models in the fashion industry? Have you ever auditioned or thought about being a model but don’t feel beautiful or handsome enough due to the stipulations that the model industry has placed upon society that successful fashion models can only be tall and thin? Well an revolution is on the rise and an army is forming. An army consisting of aspiring models of various sizes joining forces to break all barriers in the fashion industry. This army is called, Elbert Ivory Models. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1176474/files/20150127011802-Bridgetswimwear_WB_.jpg?1422350282"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>OUR MISSION</b></p>
<p><b>ELBERT IVORY MODELS</b> is a model agency that provides competitive fashion photo shoot challenges &amp; model workshops to assist in building aspiring models of various sizes and disabilities portfolios for free. Elbert Ivory Models was founded on March 17, 2014 by Elbert Ivory. We currently represents over 120 aspiring models in the South East Region of the United States. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1176479/files/20150127011903-MichaelHeckerWB.jpg?1422350343"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>Who is Elbert Ivory?</b></p>
<p>Just call Elbert Ivory ""Professor Xavier"" of the model industry. Elbert Ivory is an fashion photographer, model coach &amp; aspiring model. Unfortunately due to his height at only 5ft tall, he was not eligible to be accepted in a model agency so he decided to take a dream for himself and instill it within other aspiring models When starting Elbert Ivory Models Agency he vowed to not discriminate against and accept aspiring models of various sizes . Elbert was born and raised in Chicago Illinois but currently lives in Atlanta, Georgia. In Fall 2013 Elbert hosted a mock live version of the hit reality competition show, “America’s Next Top Model” at his local community college called, Georgia Perimeter College. The live show was a big success on campus attracting over 100+ aspiring models on campus to audition. With the success of the live campus show Elbert had plans to expand his modeling goals. Building a model portfolio can cost hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars and Elbert could not afford to build his portfolio so he decided to help aspiring models build theirs at no cost by having them compete in unique themed fashion photo shoot challenges. Elbert purchased his first Canon camera and began scouting aspiring models on his college campus to form his army, thus Elbert Ivory Models was born. Since the birth of Elbert Ivory Models his league of extraordinary models has grown to 126 aspiring models located in various states in South East. Elbert Ivory has plans to purchase his first agency facility in Atlanta, Georgia in 2015 with future expansion plans for various major U.S cities and countries. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1176481/files/20150127011940-Alexswimwear-2models.jpg?1422350380"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><br/></div><div>

</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Stretch Goals:</b><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>We can do it!</b></p>
<p>At $100,000 we can begin hiring model agent(s) to start networking with potential clients such as Nike, Gap, H&amp;M &amp; Express, schedule bookings and negotiate model contracts</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>We can do it!</b></p>
<p>At $500,000 we can targeting and marketing &amp; schedule meetings with potential clients for our agency. Persuade potential clients to hire our models for their next campaign ad and photo shoots.</p>
<p><b>Push it to the MAX</b></p>
<p>At $750,000 we can add state of the art features to our photography studio space</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Mission Impossible</b></p>
<p>At $1,000,000 we will begin the process of adding another Elbert Ivory Models agency in New York City or Los Angeles after the successful completion of Elbert Ivory Models agency in Atlanta Georgia. Due to the high cost per square foot space in NYC &amp; L.A, these locations would be office space only for model agents and model scouts.</p>
<p><b>WOW! MORE THAN A $1,000,000!</b></p>
<p>We need you to help us exceed our goal so we can look into expanding to various fashion capitols such as New York City. We appreciate all your hard work and support in Liking, sharing, tweeting and donating your hard earned money to this 1st of a kind model agency.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1176493/files/20150127012413-mattyscarf_wb_5.jpg?1422350653"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Risks and challenges</b></p>
<p>The fashion industry is extremely competitive and a cutthroat business. Finding the perfect location for Elbert Ivory Models Agency is crucial and takes strategic planning. We realize that Atlanta, Georgia is predominantly a commercial based fashion market while New York, Paris and Milan which contains all markets in the model industry. Once the location has been finalized and property purchased the next phase will be hiring experienced model agent(s). With the fashion industries strict model height &amp; waist requirements set at 5’9” to 6ft, size 0-6 for females and 5’11” to 6’ 3” size 28-32 for males, Elbert Ivory Models are breaking those requirements with no height and waist size requirements but this is not easy as most clients such as Nike, GAP, H&amp;M, American Apparel, Guess &amp; Express have also set these height and waist standards for their models. We realize that these height and waist size stipulations are in place as a cost effective strategy when fashion designers make sample pieces/outfits for photo shoots &amp; fashion shows. With your help we can eliminate these requirements by offering potential clients creative ways to save them money while revolutionizing in the fashion industry by booking models of various sizes. Only the most successful model agencies survive. Successful agencies consists of exceptional models with the best model agents scheduling and booking models for clients such as Nike, Guess, Gap, Versace etc. Elbert Ivory Models will strive to become the first equal opportunity Model Agency in the world. As a backer of our project you will be rewarded not only with tangible items but with satisfaction that you contributed to an agency that will be break all barriers and change the face of the fashion industry forever.

Are you tired of seeing the typical 6ft tall size 2 models in the fashion industry? Have you ever auditioned or thought about being a model but don’t feel beautiful or handsome enough due to the stipulations that the model industry has placed upon society that successful fashion models can only be tall and thin? Well an revolution is on the rise and an army is forming. An army consisting of aspiring models of various sizes joining forces to break all barriers in the fashion industry. This army is called, Elbert Ivory Models. 
OUR MISSION
ELBERT IVORY MODELS is a model agency that provides competitive fashion photo shoot challenges & model workshops to assist in building aspiring models of various sizes and disabilities portfolios for free. Elbert Ivory Models was founded on March 17, 2014 by Elbert Ivory. We currently represents over 120 aspiring models in the South East Region of the United States. 
Who is Elbert Ivory?
Just call Elbert Ivory ""Professor Xavier"" of the model industry. Elbert Ivory is an fashion photographer, model coach & aspiring model. Unfortunately due to his height at only 5ft tall, he was not eligible to be accepted in a model agency so he decided to take a dream for himself and instill it within other aspiring models When starting Elbert Ivory Models Agency he vowed to not discriminate against and accept aspiring models of various sizes . Elbert was born and raised in Chicago Illinois but currently lives in Atlanta, Georgia. In Fall 2013 Elbert hosted a mock live version of the hit reality competition show, “America’s Next Top Model” at his local community college called, Georgia Perimeter College. The live show was a big success on campus attracting over 100+ aspiring models on campus to audition. With the success of the live campus show Elbert had plans to expand his modeling goals. Building a model portfolio can cost hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars and Elbert could not afford to build his portfolio so he decided to help aspiring models build theirs at no cost by having them compete in unique themed fashion photo shoot challenges. Elbert purchased his first Canon camera and began scouting aspiring models on his college campus to form his army, thus Elbert Ivory Models was born. Since the birth of Elbert Ivory Models his league of extraordinary models has grown to 126 aspiring models located in various states in South East. Elbert Ivory has plans to purchase his first agency facility in Atlanta, Georgia in 2015 with future expansion plans for various major U.S cities and countries.

Stretch Goals:

We can do it!
At $100,000 we can begin hiring model agent(s) to start networking with potential clients such as Nike, Gap, H&M & Express, schedule bookings and negotiate model contracts

We can do it!
At $500,000 we can targeting and marketing & schedule meetings with potential clients for our agency. Persuade potential clients to hire our models for their next campaign ad and photo shoots.
Push it to the MAX
At $750,000 we can add state of the art features to our photography studio space

Mission Impossible
At $1,000,000 we will begin the process of adding another Elbert Ivory Models agency in New York City or Los Angeles after the successful completion of Elbert Ivory Models agency in Atlanta Georgia. Due to the high cost per square foot space in NYC & L.A, these locations would be office space only for model agents and model scouts.
WOW! MORE THAN A $1,000,000!
We need you to help us exceed our goal so we can look into expanding to various fashion capitols such as New York City. We appreciate all your hard work and support in Liking, sharing, tweeting and donating your hard earned money to this 1st of a kind model agency.
How else can you help
We appreciate your generous contribution to this unique project and the help does not stop there. We also need help getting the word out to all your family, friends coworkers, cosplayers and your followers via Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr and all your favorite social networking sites. Be sure to share this agency with your favorite fashion companies such as Nike & H&M. Spread the word to them as they may be potential clients for Elbert Ivory Models!

To show our appreciation we have created exceptional personalized rewards tailored just for you. Enjoy an exclusive photo shoot with our models, receive tickets to Elbert Ivory Models Agency Grand opening, personalized plaque mounted in Elbert Ivory Model agency wall and so much more rewards.


Risks and challenges
The fashion industry is extremely competitive and a cutthroat business. Finding the perfect location for Elbert Ivory Models Agency is crucial and takes strategic planning. We realize that Atlanta, Georgia is predominantly a commercial based fashion market while New York, Paris and Milan which contains all markets in the model industry. Once the location has been finalized and property purchased the next phase will be hiring experienced model agent(s). With the fashion industries strict model height & waist requirements set at 5’9” to 6ft, size 0-6 for females and 5’11” to 6’ 3” size 28-32 for males, Elbert Ivory Models are breaking those requirements with no height and waist size requirements but this is not easy as most clients such as Nike, GAP, H&M, American Apparel, Guess & Express have also set these height and waist standards for their models. We realize that these height and waist size stipulations are in place as a cost effective strategy when fashion designers make sample pieces/outfits for photo shoots & fashion shows. With your help we can eliminate these requirements by offering potential clients creative ways to save them money while revolutionizing in the fashion industry by booking models of various sizes. Only the most successful model agencies survive. Successful agencies consists of exceptional models with the best model agents scheduling and booking models for clients such as Nike, Guess, Gap, Versace etc. Elbert Ivory Models will strive to become the first equal opportunity Model Agency in the world. As a backer of our project you will be rewarded not only with tangible items but with satisfaction that you contributed to an agency that will be break all barriers and change the face of the fashion industry forever. Thank you kindly.

</div><p>Hello, My name is Chad Eastin and I would love to share with
you how a local coffee shop is impacting Enid OK and the world in a big way and
give you the opportunity to partner in that. </p>
<p>Let me first introduce you to the Five80 coffeehouse and
tell you a little about what we do. Five80 is a local non-profit business (under the umbrella of Forgotten ministries) created with two purposes in mind. First it is providing a place of community for
all walks of life in Enid. You will see everyone from Lawyers and Politicians
to the homeless and lonely coming to seek refuge from daily life, have business
meetings, celebrate life events and simply enjoy excellent coffee and food. The
way we are able to offer this service is through our “pay as you can” business
model. This model only asks people to pay whatever they can whether that is the
suggested total or nothing at all, they will still receive the same courtesy
and dignity. You can follow the link (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PzySNEJrBg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PzySNEJrBg</a>)
to watch a short video that conveys our heart. Secondly, we are a fund producer
for local charities and organizations that are performing philanthropic work
day in and day out here in Enid and around the world. As a business we are
careful to run as efficiently as possible to create the most income that we can
in order to better serve the “charity of the month”. Our whole goal is to create
a financial resource for those seeking to better our community. </p>
<p>A few of the organizations that we have supported are:
Forgotten Ministries (our ""parent"" organization), Monroe Elementary, Touch India, Hosanna Ministries, and
an organization building schools in Zambia. Some of the things these
organizations have done with the money include, but are not limited to, feeding
and clothing the homeless in Enid, provide fans and AC units to low income
families in the summer, provide coats and gloves to low income children for the
winter, help orphans and widows in India, build schools in Africa, and provide
fresh water to third world countries. </p>
<p>On average we have been able to give around $2,000 away each
month and desire for that number to increase. The vision for increasing the
amount of money that we have comes down to one thing; a roaster. Buying a
roaster is a huge step for our coffeehouse, not only will it allow us to save
the money that we normally use buying our roasted coffee, but is also gives us
the opportunity to supply other coffeehouses and grocery stores with our
roasted coffee. When we are up and running with our roasting we will easily double
the money that we are sending out each month to the community of Enid. </p>
<p>Here is where I am asking you to step in and partner with
us. The cost of the roaster and the build out will be right around $35,000. We
have already secured $18,000 and we still need $17,000 in order to begin this endeavor.
I am asking you to make an investment into our cause that will in turn multiply
itself over and over again and will never stop producing funds to pour into
Enid. It is a sound investment by any measure. We have proven ourselves again
and again to be responsible and efficient with what we have been entrusted. We
have been open for over a year and we are totally debt free ensuring that all
money brought in, goes right back out to support the charity or organization of
the month. </p><p></p></div>","Hello, My name is Chad Eastin and I would love to share with

</h3><p>My name is Melissa
and Al is my husband of almost 15 years. We are a loving and fun couple who has
been looking forward to being parents for a long time.  We had no idea how common infertility
was until it was our turn to go through it.  It is not only embarrassing and painful to talk about it,
but it carries with it a stigma of inferiority and guilt, that is often a
burden that can take its toll on the strongest mind.  Too many of us carry the shame of unspoken failure and soon
a month turns into a year and a year into countless nights of tears,
frustration and disappointment. 
What do we do?  Who do we
turn to? We’ve been down the path of treatments, multiple miscarriages and more
heartbreak, but now we have renewed hope. 
</p>
<p>We have come to the
realization that there are many ways to form a family and adoption has become
our new path.  We are ready to be
parents and love a child unconditionally and provide a home filled with encouragement,
patience, discipline, guidance, laughter and all those things that a healthy
relationship can provide a little one. 
</p>
<p>Why do we need
help?  We are working with a
private adoption agency and are in the initial stages of a domestic adoption.  Our first application has been
submitted, but adoption is an extremely expensive process due to the large
amount of legal documentation to be processed.  It is very tempting to throw your hands up and give up, but
we have never found that good things come easy and sometimes it’s ok to ask for
help.  </p>
<p>It has been said
many times that it takes a village to raise a child, but we believe that for
us, it is going to take a village to bring ours home.  We invite you to be a part of our village, our story,
through your support, encouragement and words of wisdom.  There are many benefits to helping
others and you will be making a difference, a huge difference in a child’s
life.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your
support!  It means more than you
can imagine and if you are not able to provide financial support, please leave
us words of encouragement or take time to talk to someone that is going through
infertility.  Show them they are
not alone.  </p>
<p>We would like to
give another couple the chance to start their own adoption fund.  Help us exceed our goal and we will pay
it forward by donating the overage to a couple of our choice. </p>

<h3>Hola,</h3>
<p>Mi nombre es Melissa y Al es mi esposo de
casi 15 años. Somos una pareja amorosa y divertida que ha estado a la espera de
ser padres por mucho tiempo. No teníamos ni idea de cuán común es la
infertilidad hasta que llegó nuestro turno para pasar por ella. No sólo es
vergonzoso y doloroso hablar de ello, pero lleva consigo un estigma de
inferioridad y culpa, que a menudo es una carga que puede hacer mella en la
mente fuerte. Muchos de nosotros llevamos la vergüenza del fracaso silencioso y
pronto un mes se convierte en un año y un año en incontables noches de
lágrimas, frustración y decepción. ¿Qué hacemos? ¿A quién recurrir? Hemos
estado por el camino de los tratamientos, múltiples abortos involuntarios y más
angustia, pero ahora hemos renovado la esperanza.</p>
<p>Hemos llegado a la conclusión de que hay
muchas maneras de formar una familia y la adopción se ha convertido en nuestro
nuevo camino. Estamos preparados para ser padres y darle amor incondicional a
un niño y proporcionar un hogar lleno de ánimo, paciencia, disciplina, guianza,
risa y todas esas cosas que una relación sana puede proporcionarle a un niño.</p>
<p>¿Por qué necesitamos ayuda? Estamos
trabajando con una agencia de adopción privada y estamos en las etapas
iniciales de una adopción nacional. Nuestra primera aplicación ha sido
presentada, pero la adopción es un proceso extremadamente costoso debido a la
gran cantidad de documentación legal para ser procesado. Es muy tentador querer
tirar las manos al aire y darse por vencido, pero nunca hemos encontrado que
las cosas buenas vienen fácil y a veces tenemos que pedir ayuda.</p>
<p>Se ha dicho muchas veces que se necesita
un pueblo para criar a un niño, pero creemos que para nosotros, va a tomar un
pueblo para traer un hijo a nuestro hogar. Te invitamos a ser parte de nuestro
pueblo, a nuestra historia, a través de tu apoyo, aliento y palabras de sabiduría.
Hay muchos beneficios en ayudar a los demás y sabes que vas a estar haciendo
una diferencia, una gran diferencia en la vida de un niño.</p>
<p>Gracias por tu apoyo! Esto significa más
de lo que puedas imaginar y si no tienes la capacidad de proporcionar apoyo
financiero, por favor déjanos palabras de aliento o toma el tiempo para hablar
con alguien que está pasando por el proceso de infertilidad. Muéstrales que no
están solos.</p>
<p>Nos gustaría darle otra pareja la
oportunidad de iniciar su propio fondo para la adopción. Ayúdanos a superar
nuestro objetivo financiero y vamos a devolver el favor donando un porcentaje del
excedente a una pareja de nuestra elección.</p>

amount of legal documentation to be processed.  It is very tempting to throw your hands up and give up, but
we have never found that good things come easy and sometimes it’s ok to ask for
help.  
It has been said
many times that it takes a village to raise a child, but we believe that for
us, it is going to take a village to bring ours home.  We invite you to be a part of our village, our story,
through your support, encouragement and words of wisdom.  There are many benefits to helping
others and you will be making a difference, a huge difference in a child’s
life.  
Thank you for your
support!  It means more than you
can imagine and if you are not able to provide financial support, please leave
us words of encouragement or take time to talk to someone that is going through
infertility.  Show them they are
not alone.  
We would like to
give another couple the chance to start their own adoption fund.  Help us exceed our goal and we will pay
it forward by donating the overage to a couple of our choice.

Hola,
Mi nombre es Melissa y Al es mi esposo de
casi 15 años. Somos una pareja amorosa y divertida que ha estado a la espera de
ser padres por mucho tiempo. No teníamos ni idea de cuán común es la
infertilidad hasta que llegó nuestro turno para pasar por ella. No sólo es
vergonzoso y doloroso hablar de ello, pero lleva consigo un estigma de
inferioridad y culpa, que a menudo es una carga que puede hacer mella en la
mente fuerte. Muchos de nosotros llevamos la vergüenza del fracaso silencioso y
pronto un mes se convierte en un año y un año en incontables noches de
lágrimas, frustración y decepción. ¿Qué hacemos? ¿A quién recurrir? Hemos
estado por el camino de los tratamientos, múltiples abortos involuntarios y más
angustia, pero ahora hemos renovado la esperanza.
Hemos llegado a la conclusión de que hay
muchas maneras de formar una familia y la adopción se ha convertido en nuestro
nuevo camino. Estamos preparados para ser padres y darle amor incondicional a
un niño y proporcionar un hogar lleno de ánimo, paciencia, disciplina, guianza,
risa y todas esas cosas que una relación sana puede proporcionarle a un niño.
¿Por qué necesitamos ayuda? Estamos
trabajando con una agencia de adopción privada y estamos en las etapas
iniciales de una adopción nacional. Nuestra primera aplicación ha sido
presentada, pero la adopción es un proceso extremadamente costoso debido a la
gran cantidad de documentación legal para ser procesado. Es muy tentador querer
tirar las manos al aire y darse por vencido, pero nunca hemos encontrado que
las cosas buenas vienen fácil y a veces tenemos que pedir ayuda.
Se ha dicho muchas veces que se necesita
un pueblo para criar a un niño, pero creemos que para nosotros, va a tomar un
pueblo para traer un hijo a nuestro hogar. Te invitamos a ser parte de nuestro
pueblo, a nuestra historia, a través de tu apoyo, aliento y palabras de sabiduría.
Hay muchos beneficios en ayudar a los demás y sabes que vas a estar haciendo
una diferencia, una gran diferencia en la vida de un niño.
Gracias por tu apoyo! Esto significa más
de lo que puedas imaginar y si no tienes la capacidad de proporcionar apoyo
financiero, por favor déjanos palabras de aliento o toma el tiempo para hablar
con alguien que está pasando por el proceso de infertilidad. Muéstrales que no
están solos.
Nos gustaría darle otra pareja la
oportunidad de iniciar su propio fondo para la adopción. Ayúdanos a superar
nuestro objetivo financiero y vamos a devolver el favor donando un porcentaje del
excedente a una pareja de nuestra elección.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

two liters, or eight glasses, of water per day. Doctors and
nutritionists have recommended this for years, yet still most of us
fail to meet that goal. But why? Here’s what we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Without water, a person will die
	within three days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without enough water, dehydration
	occurs and can cause electrolyte imbalances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without enough water, our brain
	function suffers, we feel tired, and our bowels slow down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We know these things are true, so it
isn’t a huge leap to understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Appropriate
	water intake detoxifies the body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adequate water intake helps you
	think more clearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balanced water drinking keeps urine diluted and decreases the risk of urinary stones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you drink enough water, your
	skin and hair look better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 cups of water each day makes you
	feel better, improves your performance mentally and physically, and
	makes you look healthier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of this information that we
already know, why don’t we drink enough
water? In many cases, we just don’t think about it or
prioritize it the way we should. Many of us mistake thirst for
hunger.

<h2>The Solution:</h2>
<p>8Cups is a smart water bottle that
syncs with an app on your mobile phone to track your water intake and
remind you to drink more.

<p>Adapting IR sensor for leveling is unique
idea of 8Cups, The principal of this idea is that the light bends when it meets
the water. Then, if the water is in the container, the receiver on the opposite
direction cannot receive the light from the sender and vice versa. 8Cups applied patented technology by using these facts. By these facts, 8Cups has advantage on
cost efficiency. Thus, 8Cups catches two hares which are cost cutting and
technological innovation at once. </p>
<p></p>
<p>IR leveling sensor that 8Cups team’s own technology to measuring water leveling permitted to be patent registered on KIPO (Korea Intellectual Property Organization) on January 22nd 2015. </p>
<p>Now 8Cups team will apply PCT(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation...</a>), then going to request patent to U.S, EU and other regions. </p>

<p>We have created a method that works without direct contact with the water contents. It uses light emitting and receiving sensors with patented infrared technology that has been developed by the company.</p>

<p>Daniel Joo, the CEO of Jellycoaster,
came up with the concept of 8Cups after personal experiences with
inadequate water intake. He says, <i>“This past summer, I
experienced the discomfort of a urinary stone. My doctor advised me to
drink a lot of water as part of the treatment. I was always
forgetting to drink and then confused as to how much water I had each
day. I couldn’t help but wish there was an easy way to track my
water intake.</i></p>
<p>“<i>Then when my wife became
pregnant, her doctor told her drink 8 glasses of water each day
without fail. Again, I thought about keeping track of water and how
inconvenient it is. </i>
</p>
<p>“<i>That’s when the concept of
8Cups was born. Finally, a way to simply drink your water and have it
automatically tracked!” </i>

<p></p></div>","8Cups is the winnter (1st) in Samsung Wennovation contest. http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/people/2015/01/178_171870.htmlWe're excited to share this news with all of our funders as we look forward to a successful year. Thank you! 8Cups Team.  :) The Problem:
Only 2% of adults drink the recommended
two liters, or eight glasses, of water per day. Doctors and
nutritionists have recommended this for years, yet still most of us
fail to meet that goal. But why? Here’s what we know:


Without water, a person will die
	within three days.


Without enough water, dehydration
	occurs and can cause electrolyte imbalances.


Without enough water, our brain
	function suffers, we feel tired, and our bowels slow down.


We know these things are true, so it
isn’t a huge leap to understand that:


Appropriate
	water intake detoxifies the body.


Adequate water intake helps you
	think more clearly.


Balanced water drinking keeps urine diluted and decreases the risk of urinary stones.


When you drink enough water, your
	skin and hair look better.


8 cups of water each day makes you
	feel better, improves your performance mentally and physically, and
	makes you look healthier.


With all of this information that we
already know, why don’t we drink enough
water? In many cases, we just don’t think about it or
prioritize it the way we should. Many of us mistake thirst for
hunger. 

The Solution:
8Cups is a smart water bottle that
syncs with an app on your mobile phone to track your water intake and
remind you to drink more. 

8Cups integrated sensors trigger an LED
display to remind you drink water on a regular, timed basis. When you
drink, the amount is synced to your app so that you can track how
much you have ingested and how much you have left to drink that day
to meet your water intake goal. 

Each day’s water intake data is saved
in the app for future reference. 

The Key Features of 8Cups:
8Cups utilizes a wireless charging
system. Each charge lasts up to one week of use. This is particularly
useful when traveling or engaging in outdoor activities where
charging ports may not be readily available. 

The 8Cups bottle is completely
waterproof. All of the technology and sensors are sealed within the
design and will not be damaged during everyday use and washing.


A no-slip rubber bottom keeps your 8Cups from slipping or sliding on smooth or wet surfaces.The 8Cups is constructed of Tritan, a safe, BPA-free type of plastic that is long-lasting, and wear resistant. Because it will replace disposable water bottles, it is eco-friendly.*Specifications are tentative.
Who Could Use an 8Cups?
It’s more like, who couldn’t use an
8Cups?! Anyone can benefit from the ability to effortlessly monitor
their water intake. Specifically, people engaging in sports can
ensure hydration, those with dry skin or hair issues, or people with
medical conditions that require adequate water intake to dilute
medication or improve symptoms. This is truly an innovation that
anyone can use. And it’s an awesome gift!
For those of you sitting in an office
all day, drinking coffee or soda, you’d feel more awake and
clear-headed if you drank enough water. Let us introduce you to
8Cups! 

Ladies (and gentlemen) watching their
figures, drinking water is the most important part of a healthy diet
or weight loss program. It also makes your hair look fantastic and
shiny and your skin glowing. Let 8Cups help you remember to keep up
with your water intake!
Colors
Not everyone wants a bland one-color only option for a water bottle. That’s why we are offering our 8Cups in 5 amazing colors: Pure White, Space Black, Deep Purple, Shiny Emerald, and Ruby Red.
Software
The 8Cups software features include a
calendar with a timeline that graphs your water intake in comparison
to the recommended daily amount of two liters. It provides motivation
with reminders and the option to take photos for comparison as your
skin and health improve. The software also allows you to set your own
goals for water intake. Want to drink more than 2 liters? Set your
own goals and challenge yourself. The app tracks your intake, so you can see how many days in a row you drank your full target amount of water. We will continue to add features to enhance your hydrating experience. Now draft of smartphone application is on progress. Smartwatch Integration
We are planning an integration option
with smartwatches. Since many of these contain fitness-related apps,
your water status will be evaluated with activity and environmental
conditions.

How does 8Cups sensor assess the water level?

Adapting IR sensor for leveling is unique
idea of 8Cups, The principal of this idea is that the light bends when it meets
the water. Then, if the water is in the container, the receiver on the opposite
direction cannot receive the light from the sender and vice versa. 8Cups applied patented technology by using these facts. By these facts, 8Cups has advantage on
cost efficiency. Thus, 8Cups catches two hares which are cost cutting and
technological innovation at once. 

IR leveling sensor that 8Cups team’s own technology to measuring water leveling permitted to be patent registered on KIPO (Korea Intellectual Property Organization) on January 22nd 2015. 
Now 8Cups team will apply PCT(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation...), then going to request patent to U.S, EU and other regions. 
What We’ve Already AccomplishedWorking Mock up - The amount of water consumption is automatically updated on your smartphone. We have finished developing the main functions between the bottle and application. 
We have created a method that works without direct contact with the water contents. It uses light emitting and receiving sensors with patented infrared technology that has been developed by the company.
A handmade prototype has been successfully produced.
Currently, we are building the printed circuit board.
AND we have launched a beta version of our app in the Google Play Store! Check out the basic functions before the final product is released! This beta version will be updated with increased functionality when 8Cups is released!
8Cups App for Android (Beta) 
Funding will enable us to move forward with production, covering material and molding costs.



PCB is completed for implementing
technology and 8Cups is now stepping forward to actual production. 



 The very first wireless charger is updated! It is going to be circular in the next updated version. 

Box Design
Final version of product packaging design is decided as above. 

Perks
The 8Cups Story
Daniel Joo, the CEO of Jellycoaster,
came up with the concept of 8Cups after personal experiences with
inadequate water intake. He says, “This past summer, I
experienced the discomfort of a urinary stone. My doctor advised me to
drink a lot of water as part of the treatment. I was always
forgetting to drink and then confused as to how much water I had each
day. I couldn’t help but wish there was an easy way to track my
water intake.
“Then when my wife became
pregnant, her doctor told her drink 8 glasses of water each day
without fail. Again, I thought about keeping track of water and how
inconvenient it is. 

“That’s when the concept of
8Cups was born. Finally, a way to simply drink your water and have it
automatically tracked!”

The Story




Nusantara is an Indonesian term for the Indonesian archipelago. 


We are the Berkeley Indonesian Student Association which is comprised of 120 Indonesian students and counting. To celebrate our 30th anniversary, we will be holding Nusantara 2015: Experience Indonesia, the Bay Area's largest Indonesian cultural night. 
The Indonesian community at Berkeley is not just those who are Indonesian by birth, but it consists of anyone interested in Indonesia. That is why we are hosting Nusantara - to bring a piece of our home to Berkeley.  
Nusantara will also be a collective effort within the Bay Area. We will be joining forces with other colleges and universities across the Bay Area. Besides uniting the Indonesian community in the Bay Area, our purpose of holding this event is to introduce Indonesian culture. 
With your help, we can make this event the biggest Indonesian cultural festival in the Bay Area.


Our Efforts

Throughout the past six months, we've participated in events like the East Asian Union Night Market to fundraise for Nusantara. Our students have volunteered their weekends and weekdays to flyer and table on Sproul, make Indomie, sate (chicken skewers) and es campur (mixed-fruit ice), amongst others.

These are some of our favourite highlights:

East Asian Union Night Market 
BISA Futsal Cup
Calapalooza 2015


Nasi Gila Fundraiser

   The Numbers


While we have done some fundraising over the past 8 months, we still need some more in order to put on a grand event. 




Here is what your contribution will support:


Event staging and sound design for the performances
Food vendor area tents
Marketing and advertising
Administrative costs (electricity, cleaning and maintenance, sound operator)
 
Our projected costs for the event is a little over $15,000. We have an initial fundraising goal of $1,500; however, additional donations that take us past our goal will be used for the event and to maximize the potential of Nusantara. If we hit that goal, we can achieve the final step of reaching our ultimate goal of $15,000, which would allow us to make Nusantara the best it can be in April of this year.  

    The Impact 

BISA is a student organization and your contribution will lift the level of Nusantara's success.  Even without attending the festival, your contribution will allow you to participate in community it creates by way of a t-shirt, or special thank you message from the Nusantara committee, or even a copy of the Nusantara documentary! 





    How You Can Help
 Come to our event and experience Indonesia!
Contribute. Share this link on Facebook, Twitter, etc. Show us some love! 
We understand that not everyone is in a financial position to contribute.  The next best way to support is help us get the word out!

<p>As a swimmer
for over 35 years, and a coach of the sport for nearly 20, I’ve seen my
share of swimming-related injuries. But it wasn’t until my own near
concussion from a collision with the pool wall that I realized the very real
danger hidden lurking at the water's edge. </p>
<p>My injury inspired a quest for pool safety, both as a swimmer and coach. With the safety of children entrusted to my care while in the pool, I felt something had to be
developed to help protect swimmers- particularly those most likely to encounter accidental collisions with a pool wall, including children, the elderly, the inexperienced and swimmers with special needs like sight impairment.</p>
<p>After years
of research, design and development, I am pleased to announce the arrival of SAFE LANE-a unique safety system to help protect swimmers from the harm of wall collisions.  You can learn more about SAFE LANE, and see plenty of pictures and videos of SAFE LANE in action here: <a href=""http://safelaneswimming.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.safelaneswimming.com</a></p>
<p>I look
forward to working with you to keep children and all swimmers everywhere safe with every stroke they
take.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What is SAFE LANE?</b></p>
<p>Presenting a unique safety system that cushions the impact of wall collisions, lessening injury without impeding stroke, flip turns or race times. The patented design is:</p>
<p>· Easy to install, simply attaching to the lane lines</p>
<p>· Unnoticeable to swimmers, except in the instance of wall collision where it helps prevent injury</p>· Lightweight and portable when not in use</div><div>
<br/>
<p><b>Who Does SAFE LANE Help?</b></p>
<p>SAFE LANE was designed to help children swimmers in particular, but the benefits do not stop there.  SAFE LANE provides injury protection for EVERY swimmer in the water. It is especially
helpful for pools with swimmers who are:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Young or inexperienced</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Sight-impaired
</p>
<p>·<span>

<div>
<p><b>What does SAFE LANE do?</b></p>
<p>Within lap swimming and general pool use, wall collision is a very real issue for a number of reasons. SAFE LANE is a unique and easy system that helps prevent injury from such impacts, providing protection against:</p>

<p>USA Swimming, the National Governing Body for the sport of swimming, has officially acknowledged the danger of concussions to swimmers hitting their heads on pool walls.<br/></p>

<b>What Do You Do to Help?</b>
</div>
<div>You can help in two ways:</div>
<div>
<b>1. Donations</b> - In order to get SAFE LANE into pools to start protecting children and all other swimmers, we need some critical items:</div>
<div>- <b><u>Insurance</u></b>.  Consumer products are expensive to insure, and safety products are particularly expensive to insure.  Before putting the first SAFE LANE in the pool, we'll need to purchase $12,000 of insurance.</div>
<div>- <b><u>Inventory</u></b>.  We will be offering SAFE LANE to school districts  and other multi-pool entities, so a single order may entail the purchase of many SAFE LANE systems.  We will need to spend $5,446 up front to have the right amount of inventory on hand when we go to market. </div>
<div>- <b><u>Marketing</u></b>. We know that word of mouth will be a key marketing tactic for SAFE LANE'S success, but we need some initial buzz to get the first SAFE LANE systems in pools and in use. $1,943 will go towards well-placed advertisements to get the attention of the swimming community and building a network through our website and emarketing.<span> </span>
</div>
<div><span>Every penny helps, and every penny will be spent working toward getting SAFE LANE into pools and protecting people from injury.</span></div>
<div><b>2. Help us spread the word</b></div>
<div>- Please take part in our mission to help protect children and other swimmers from injury.  Help us share information about SAFE LANE with swimmers and pool officials/managers near you.  Our innovative system will make a difference for all swimmers- from the well-seasoned water aficionados to the inexperienced, and all levels and capabilities in between.  Ways you can help us get the word out:</div>
<div>     - E<span>mail the link to this Indiegogo campaign to anyone you think might be interested in helping protect swimmers from injury. Especially swimmers who may need additional safety precautions in the pool, like those who are young, sight-impaired, are elderly or have special needs.  </span>
</div>
<div><span>     - Use the Indiegogo share tools to post about the SAFE LANE on Facebook or Twitter.  Let people know that you are helping make pools safer for swimmers of every level.</span></div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We've uncovered data from hospitals around the country that illustrate just how numerous and dangerous pool wall collisions can be. Swimmers of all levels can benefit from additional measures taken to ensure their safety. Like extra padding around an end-zone goal post, SAFE LANE will help protect swimmers from potentially damaging collisions. Your contribution can help put SAFE LANE in pools, and all swimmers will be able to swim confidently, knowing they have a serious layer of protection between them and the wall.   </p>

There are many families in our communities that struggle to get the support that they need for their loved ones.  They would like to provide a better quality of life but do not have the means in which to develop this quality of life plan.  BnB will use any additional funds to provide grants to families that apply for the quality of life services so that trained BnB consultants will work closely with these families to develop a quality of life plan and retain resources to build new meaning into the lives of their loved ones.  If significant donations are received above the campaign funding amount then BnB will extend similar grants to organizations that are struggling to meet the needs of underserved communities.  BnB will provide grants in the area of Strategic Planning, Quality of Life Coordination, Quality Improvement Services, Training and Development and Administrative Supports and Services.  Parents, employees, individuals and stakeholders will have the opportunity to apply for these funds and BnB will provide equal opportunities to work with each organization dependent upon financial need.  State and government officials will also be given the opportunity to recommend organizations that could use assistance. BnB is looking to make a difference in organizations in how they serve their populations one program at a time.  Any assistance provided will aid in that mission.   
Over my 20+ year career I have worked at many organizations providing both clinical and administrative services alike.  My specialty however was in strategic planning, staff motivation, training and development of services.  Throughout my career I have assisted in the development of almost 40 new programs/services.  I have transitioned dozens of programs that were in jeopardy of loosing their funding into stellar model programs and enhanced the lives of individuals served through training and development of staff and services.  As new agencies were struggling, members of the governing body and other provider agencies have often provided my contact information as a resource for assistance.  I have also received notoriety for the work that I have done in the underserved communities. 
Although BnB has been established to assist any business, its foundation will always be helping the I/DD community because that is where my greatest passion lies.  
Risks & ChallengesThere will be risks associated with gaining the most appropriate consultants that will be as passionate about their work as the founder and CEO, however with intense training and clear guidelines as to the expectations, BnB is confident that it will be able to develop a well rounded clinical and administrative staff to meet the needs of the communities served.  There may be many of you that may read this and say I would like to help but I don't have the finances right now to help. There is always something that you can do...get the word out about this organization, send a link to your friends and organizational associates.  Tell someone to tell someone; and we thank you sincerely for your support.  BnB Global Services Team",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

internet through multiple channels and platforms. You can capture content through browser, desktop and mobile applications.  You can save entire webpage or any particular part of your interest. It allows you to capture Images and Videos with a single click. </p>

What is Wepware?

 

Save what matters:
""Getting information off the internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant.""
Wepware is a next generation, award winning, smart web tool built on Web 3.0 principles that allows you to capture any part of the webpage and create a live- auto updating web scrapbook of your favorite internet content.  You simply GRAB the content, PLACE it on a page or SHARE it directly with your friends.

contents to create your own mashup on any webpage. It allows you to create
personalized dashboards with which you can access all the information at single
place. 
World's First True Web 3.0 platform:

As Mr. Einstein rightly said, information is not knowledge, but knowledge can be derived when information is curated. Curated Web is an emerging trend and fundamental of Web 3.0 philosophy. 
Future is Web 3.0 and the transition has already begun. Nova Spivack defines Web 3.0 as connective intelligence; connecting data, concepts, applications and ultimately people.

We </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">have long been affiliated with the Slow Food Ireland movement, and those philosophies continue to </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">inform our methods and decisions.</span></p>
<p>Culture/entertainment: The Glebe Bakery will not stop at damn-good baked goods.

<p>This project is close to our hearts, we believe in its power and 
potential as members of this community, as environmentalists, as 
foodies, and as business owners. No matter how we tried to plan and 
structure the future of the Glebe, we could not make it work without 
including this new project. It has become an essential bridge to cross 
for us in terms of fulfilling and maintaining the commitment to quality,
 enjoyment, inspiration and community that guides our work.</p>

<p>If we are fortunate enough to raise more money than stated above we will put it towards developing new products and making all products accessible and affordable to our local and national communities. We will also increase the programming of teaching, community and educational events </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
</div><p><span>In planning this project we have been vigilant and realistic about the risks that are involved. In consultation with our team we have determined that there are two risks that require our attention. One is the possibility of insufficient funding to complete the kitchen. The second is the possibility of insufficient demand of the produce to create sustainability of the bakery business. We have prepared to tackle both of these risks. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Firstly, we have contingency plans for developments with partial funding, should we not reach our funding goals. With €5000 raised we will purchase a new commercial oven to accomplish a greater efficiency and output of breads and cakes from our current kitchen. With €10000 raised we will create a basic kitchen space including one oven that is not self sufficient of the existing main kitchen, but serves as an overflow space for specific events or purposes. With €15000 raised, we will re-fit the kitchen with only one oven which will allow for the launching of the Glebe Bakery, but on a slightly smaller scale and with smaller scope than planned. With €20000 raised, we will be able to completely re-fit the new bakery kitchen including all stated equipment. With an excess of €20,000 we will develop new products, packaging and distribution materials, and will increase the accesibility and affordability of the produce and facility. </span></p>Secondly, we have planned a wide and innovative series of marketing strategies to launch the bakery and increase people’s awareness of it and access to it. We have planned off-site partnerships for distribution to ensure that the seasonal nature of our location does not become detrimental to the success of the bakery. We have an established reputation for quality and service, which ensures that the Bakery will begin with a huge headstart.<br/><p></p><div>

The Glebe Bakery will produce high quality, affordable, and downright delicious produce – breads, pastries, cakes, tarts, pies – all year round. The bakery will supply the Glebe café and shop, but also other outlets to ensure accessibility for those who don’t live down the road. The Glebe Bakery will employ new year-round staff, and even invite you in to teach you how to make your own bread at home! Due to the nature of our business, being a small, seasonal, and community-based, the Glebe Bakery will have huge impact – not only to you, our customers and community, but to our local economy, environment, and local cultural and entertainment scene (who said baking was just for mums!?).  
Here’s why: 

The Impact
Economy: The Glebe Bakery will directly create four local jobs, will increase the demand on local producers (including dairy, egg, vegetable and meat producers), will begin the export of local produce nationally, and will allow a larger customer base access to local and sustainable food. 
Environment: The Glebe Bakery will be run with the same ethical, environmental, and sustainable standards as the rest of the Glebe activity. As well as sourcing ingredients locally and organically, we will be using our own well-water, our own solar power, and our own composting system. We have long been affiliated with the Slow Food Ireland movement, and those philosophies continue to inform our methods and decisions.
Culture/entertainment: The Glebe Bakery will not stop at damn-good baked goods. We intend to expand the culture of food in west-cork, we intend to experiment with baking, teach baking, and incorporate the bakery into the increasing range of entertainment and events at the Glebe and surrounding areas.

This project is close to our hearts, we believe in its power and 
potential as members of this community, as environmentalists, as 
foodies, and as business owners. No matter how we tried to plan and 
structure the future of the Glebe, we could not make it work without 
including this new project. It has become an essential bridge to cross 
for us in terms of fulfilling and maintaining the commitment to quality,
 enjoyment, inspiration and community that guides our work.

  What We Need & What You Get   


 - We need €20,000 to re-fit an existing building into a professional kitchen. 
 We genuinely, humbly, appreciate any amount of investment and support you can give to this project,
The money raised will go towards the improvements on an existing building to get it up to the standards required by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (11,000 euro).
We will be buying a bakers oven (5,000 euro)
A 10ltr bakery mixer (1,000 euro)
2 fridges (1,800)
Shelving, sinks, utensils, (1,200)
If we are fortunate enough to raise more money than stated above we will put it towards developing new products and making all products accessible and affordable to our local and national communities. We will also increase the programming of teaching, community and educational events 
  Risks & Challenges  
In planning this project we have been vigilant and realistic about the risks that are involved. In consultation with our team we have determined that there are two risks that require our attention. One is the possibility of insufficient funding to complete the kitchen. The second is the possibility of insufficient demand of the produce to create sustainability of the bakery business. We have prepared to tackle both of these risks. Firstly, we have contingency plans for developments with partial funding, should we not reach our funding goals. With €5000 raised we will purchase a new commercial oven to accomplish a greater efficiency and output of breads and cakes from our current kitchen. With €10000 raised we will create a basic kitchen space including one oven that is not self sufficient of the existing main kitchen, but serves as an overflow space for specific events or purposes. With €15000 raised, we will re-fit the kitchen with only one oven which will allow for the launching of the Glebe Bakery, but on a slightly smaller scale and with smaller scope than planned. With €20000 raised, we will be able to completely re-fit the new bakery kitchen including all stated equipment. With an excess of €20,000 we will develop new products, packaging and distribution materials, and will increase the accesibility and affordability of the produce and facility. Secondly, we have planned a wide and innovative series of marketing strategies to launch the bakery and increase people’s awareness of it and access to it. We have planned off-site partnerships for distribution to ensure that the seasonal nature of our location does not become detrimental to the success of the bakery. We have an established reputation for quality and service, which ensures that the Bakery will begin with a huge headstart.

The Odd story....</h3><div>
</div><p>
<strong>2 odd guys + a dream + fantastic support = great beer for the masses! A perfect equation is you ask me….</strong> </p><span><p> </p>
<p>Oddball Brewing Company started one day when two guys (co-workers) got to talking and discovered their mutual love for home brewing and a passion to one day bring great beer to the masses. Mark and Bill have been home brewing collectively for 37 years (that’s a whole lotta beer!) and have been able to hone their brewing skills through trial and error. They have not only traveled various places across the country (and world) in search of odd brews, but also bring their own unique interpretations of favorite beer styles to the mix (which can be a bit odd at times). Breweries, bars, brew fests…you name it…they have been there to taste wide varieties of brews (the dedication and sacrifice is mind-boggling). </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span><em>The brewery is situated in an 1890's brick building (that’s old) which in previous lives has been a restaurant, pizza parlor, art studio…the list could go on and on. Oddball will be a 7 barrel system carefully, meticulously, lovingly…(you get the point) built by the brewers/ co-owners themselves (no that’s a lot of beer).</em></span></p></span><h3> </h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> Building a successful brewery takes time, patience,<br/>and most importantly support. We have been overwhelmed with the support through individual interest and kind words we have received during this exciting<br/>adventure, but as with any new adventure and an attempt of making a dream and<br/>passion a reality, there is a financial price. We are looking for further support from individuals through generous donations. These well-appreciated donations come with rewards, of course. Each reward level will come with rewards, so the more financial support you give, the greater the rewards for you (along with our everlasting gratitude). Thank you...thank you...thank you.....</div><div>How your financial support will go to good use:</div><div>

<p>Impact?... Well great beer for the masses of course!! Who doesn't want great beer?!?! </p>
<p>The craft beer industry is growing and we want to be a part of the movement. We believe with a solid foundation comprised of unique and flavorful brews and support can place us in an industry that values its customers. </p> Beer + money = happiness  </div><div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> What happens if we don't get your financial support? Well, quite frankly the brewery may take longer to open. A shame, right! We don't want this to happen. Our plan is to open November 2015 and we want to see this happen as much as you do, so please help us make this happen. Think of your family, neighbors....beer lovers unite!!!  </p>
</div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Not only are we asking for your generous financial contribution to our fantastic brewery, but we are also asking you to shout it from the rooftops (well get the word out anyways). Tell your family, friends, coworkers, strangers......show your love!! Help us campaign (you know you want to).
