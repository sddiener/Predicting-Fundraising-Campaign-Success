<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>COVID 19 – BUSINESS IMPACT </strong></h3>
<p>The Covid 19 disruption is obviously causing negative economic impacts and some analysts are mentioning the possibility of a recession. Various experts are forecasting the demise of the virus to begin by late spring but others are anticipating by the end of summer, while others are even less optimistic. The current reality of the virus is that 81% of those who get it are mild cases, 13.8% need more intense treatment, and around 2% are likely to die. It is fact that the measures of governmental precautions and social distancing are now flattening the growth curve significantly. The ongoing warm weather may also act to discourage the virus. The impact on the company is difficult to absolutely determine, but it is logical to anticipate consumer confidence and the desire to make large financial commitments will be diminished, and many consumers may opt to defer larger projects. It is reasonable to assume these will fuel pent-up demand later in the year (a period of recovery). It is just reported that what appear to be viable vaccines are now in the test stage and could be implemented in reasonably short order. Some of the risks that the Covid 19 situation presents to the business are: (1) diminished sales (2) irregularities in staffing (3) disruption of some supply channels (4) skewing of the operating budget and cash flows and, (5) a safe working environment. The formulation of these projections is an opportunity for the company to do a strategies reality check and double-check its state of preparedness.</p>

<p>3) The company will continue to establish goodwill and manage long-term and loyal client relationships and this asset will be conscientiously ""mined"" and word-of-mouth encouraged at every opportunity.</p>

<h3>
<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hello! I'm Juan Diego and this is my story...  During this last crisis and after having a couple of glasses of wine, came up with </span><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">uvaera </strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">product (I guess a lot of ideas come after having some wine) I'm seeking your help to bring this amazing product to life, we've tested the prototype and let me tell you it works amazingly well! So good, that we went and got our initial </span><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Patent Pending</strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""> approval! With your help we can bring the product to market and let everyone really enjoy all the aromas and flavor of the wine. </span>
</h3>
<p>As an entrepreneur, nothing would be more satisfying for me and my family to have a product that people love, and be able to share the difference you taste when using <strong>uvaera</strong> to unleash your wine.  You will <strong>love the product!</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $50,000 to cover many expenses but the biggest ones are:  The mold for mass producing  <strong>uvaera </strong>from food-grade FDA approved materials. With this amount we will also conform to the minimum units the factories asks for, as well as the minimum number of units for the packaging . Since we know the importance of getting the product in front of as many eyeballs as possible a good % will be used for online marketing as well as hiring a PR firm and a proven ad agency to get the product into magazines and other important media.  The $50,000 goal will also give us a jump start on salaries and scouting distributors around the 50 states in order to promote and sell our product to as many stores as possible. <u>The first 100 backers will get a choice of the colors of their <strong>uvaera</strong> units. (limited edition version)</u></p>
<p>By supporting <strong>uvaera</strong> with $18.99 (the price of the product which contains 4 <strong>uvaera</strong> units to a box) you will be the first to get the <strong>uvaera</strong> product and taste the difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604061592/akmkyptmttkpmcobbodj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If we don't get to our goal, we will be covering our costs and the remainder will be donated to a non-profit organization that supports COVID research. We will be announcing the non-profit right here in our INDIEGOGO profile later on. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>With <strong>uvaera</strong> you will never have to wait for hours for your wine to finish aerating, you can just pop open a bottle, pour and swirl. In less than 30 seconds your wine will be perfect to enjoy it.  Once you get your <strong>uvaera </strong><u>please do this</u>: Pour 2 glasses of wine, one with <strong>uvaera</strong> and one without. Swirl both glasses for 30 seconds and taste both of them.  You'll feel you're drinking from 2 different types of wines. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7ArjIBRUus?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Our goal is to create a revolution in aerating wine, the science is simple but people tend to over complicate things (like purchasing expensive decanters and pour-aerators) With your help we will achieve this. Less expensive wines will taste amazing and expensive wines will taste super expensive.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are currently researching factories where to produce the final product, since we want to achieve good pricing without sacrificing quality. This and the design of the packaging have been our biggest challenges so far. Moving forward we understand that our biggest challenge will be to get our product out to the market, to get people to know it exists and to get people to try it for themselves (you make a huge difference by letting your friends know about <strong>uvaera</strong>) and notice the amazing difference.

Hello! I'm Juan Diego and this is my story...  During this last crisis and after having a couple of glasses of wine, came up with uvaera product (I guess a lot of ideas come after having some wine) I'm seeking your help to bring this amazing product to life, we've tested the prototype and let me tell you it works amazingly well! So good, that we went and got our initial Patent Pending approval! With your help we can bring the product to market and let everyone really enjoy all the aromas and flavor of the wine. 

As an entrepreneur, nothing would be more satisfying for me and my family to have a product that people love, and be able to share the difference you taste when using uvaera to unleash your wine.  You will love the product! 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking $50,000 to cover many expenses but the biggest ones are:  The mold for mass producing  uvaera from food-grade FDA approved materials. With this amount we will also conform to the minimum units the factories asks for, as well as the minimum number of units for the packaging . Since we know the importance of getting the product in front of as many eyeballs as possible a good % will be used for online marketing as well as hiring a PR firm and a proven ad agency to get the product into magazines and other important media.  The $50,000 goal will also give us a jump start on salaries and scouting distributors around the 50 states in order to promote and sell our product to as many stores as possible. The first 100 backers will get a choice of the colors of their uvaera units. (limited edition version)
By supporting uvaera with $18.99 (the price of the product which contains 4 uvaera units to a box) you will be the first to get the uvaera product and taste the difference.
 

If we don't get to our goal, we will be covering our costs and the remainder will be donated to a non-profit organization that supports COVID research. We will be announcing the non-profit right here in our INDIEGOGO profile later on. 
 

With uvaera you will never have to wait for hours for your wine to finish aerating, you can just pop open a bottle, pour and swirl. In less than 30 seconds your wine will be perfect to enjoy it.  Once you get your uvaera please do this: Pour 2 glasses of wine, one with uvaera and one without. Swirl both glasses for 30 seconds and taste both of them.  You'll feel you're drinking from 2 different types of wines. 

 
Our goal is to create a revolution in aerating wine, the science is simple but people tend to over complicate things (like purchasing expensive decanters and pour-aerators) With your help we will achieve this. Less expensive wines will taste amazing and expensive wines will taste super expensive.
 

Risks & Challenges
We are currently researching factories where to produce the final product, since we want to achieve good pricing without sacrificing quality. This and the design of the packaging have been our biggest challenges so far. Moving forward we understand that our biggest challenge will be to get our product out to the market, to get people to know it exists and to get people to try it for themselves (you make a huge difference by letting your friends know about uvaera) and notice the amazing difference. That is why we  are assigning a good percentage of the funds to create a great marketing campaign and buy the most effective media to achieve our goals.

We will work hand in hand with the advertising company to make sure that every move goes with the essential core values and beliefs of uvaera.
We will also get in touch with well-known sommeliers to get expert feedback on our product and will post their comments right here on this site.

<p><strong>About us</strong></p>
<p>The founder of Ekofungi, Mrs. Ivanka Milenkovic is a biologist and a mycologist. At the beginning of her career she has learned that science translated into practice is purposeful, and practice supported by science is successful, she stands by the belief that nature is the most perfect laboratory and that production that follows nature can only provide progress. Therefore, Ekofungi is based on these principles. Guided exclusively by the biological properties of fungi, very soon Ekofungi became a place of ZERO waste applied principle, and later an example of a real circular economy. Our production model, based on the open source model, is distributed to hundreds of entrepreneurs, who build their successful small business around the world based on the Ekofungi model.</p>

<h3>Long Story Short</h3>
<p>We wanted to make one of the oldest and healthiest cooking techniques - stone cooking - accessible to everyone. So, we created a stone pan with a little modern twist so it could be used anywhere and everywhere - from the heaters to straight on the dining table.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563903104/xzotwjqg1w7ybuytswc9.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Healthy cooking. Delicious food. Long lasting. Retains heat. Eco-friendly materials. Good presentation. Even better price. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
<p>These days, in this fast-paced world, we are always in such a rush. Barely ever do we take the time to ourselves. From high-speed Internet, to fast food, to high-demand everything - we are always rushing through life when we really should be slowing down and enjoying it. </p>
<p>So we, a group of food enthusiasts, teamed up with some of the best chefs in the world to create something that would help solve this problem of rushing. Something that would be your tool in healthy eating. Something that would allow you to use an ancient cooking method at home. Something that would bring the family together. Something that would impress your guests at your next backyard barbeque party. Something that would bring out your inner Betty Crocker even if you’re the worst chef in the world. And most importantly - something that would help you wind down and truly enjoy the food and company surrounding you. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1ceec0_17274f4e52b9454d9a1da7ad6f33abe2~mv2.gif/v1/fill/w_1366,h_767/3_grilled-t-bone-steak.gif"" src=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563904421/bzcmu7jzuyyyzzymkxne.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>That something is Piedra Cocinar. A stone pan that takes us back to our roots and reminds us to slow down sometimes. </p>
<p>Now, we know what you are thinking… What? Another cooking pan? Don’t we have enough of those on the market?</p>
<p>Well, this one is different. Isn’t that what they all say, though? But seriously. This pan takes us way back to our roots. 2000 years back. And reminds us to wind down, take our time, and enjoy the moment. </p>
<p>Inspired by Mediterranean cooking and the Mediterranean lifestyle, we believe that every person should take the time to de-stress, slow down, and truly enjoy a home-cooked meal. Whether that would be every day or just once a week - Piedra Cocinar invites you to do that by helping you cook something truly special and keeping it warm for a long time.</p>

<h3>Why Piedra Cocinar?</h3>
<h3>The Healthiest Way To Cook</h3>
<p>It is well known that the Mediterranean diet is perhaps one of the healthiest diets in the world. From fighting inflammation, to reducing the risk for heart attack, stroke &amp; Alzheimer’s disease, to encouraging healthy weight loss, to improving skin health - eating like a Mediterranean has been associated with endless health benefits.</p>
<p>Which is why we teamed up with the well-known chefs and Mediterranean food experts to bring the Piedra Cocinar project to life. Born in the small Spanish towns they continue their family cooking traditions that have been passed on generation to generation for hundreds of years. And their grandparents are living proof of the benefits of eating like a Mediterranean!</p>
<p>Mediterranean chef Santiago  - ‘’Yes, my grandma is over one hundred years old. She is still in good health and she is a very independent lady. And she still cooks daily. And what is most important - every time we sit around the table for a family dinner, she impresses us with something new. New aroma, new taste,’’ he smiles. ‘’Most people in our towns can expect to live longer, much longer than the World’s average’’.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563904586/t86wjn9dvrz61y8stnhd.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>It’s Not Another Cast Iron Skillet or Non-Stick Pan </h3>
<p>Don’t get confused here. The Piedra Cocinar pan is not just another cast iron skillet or non-stick pan. It is something completely different. It’s the thing you knew in the back of your head that your kitchen was missing. And once you try it, you won’t know how you ever lived without it! </p>
<p>Unlike most pans and baking dishes, Piedra Cocinar is created with gabbro diabase (black marble) rather than metal or glass. Due to the thermal mass of the rock and the material's property food is less likely to burn on it.</p>
<p>Not to mention, for the first time in history, our Piedra Cocinar stone pans can be used anywhere and everywhere. It’s stone cooking taken to another level! The only exception - microwaves. But microwaves aren’t good for you anyway, so it’s a win-win. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563904930/a3c1yscqma0zqdmkmlhr.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>It Takes Us Back To Our Roots</h3>
<p>Even though we would love to take all the credit, we can’t. We didn’t invent stone cooking - our ancestors did. All we did was make it accessible to everyone by creating a stone pan that can be used in any modern kitchen. And, we don’t want to brag, but we think it’s pretty awesome and our ancestors would be proud.</p>
<h3>Created By Chefs</h3>
<p>That pretty much says it all. You know, if it was created by chefs - it has to be good.</p>
<p>We are a team of Spanish and UK engineers, chefs, and food lovers. By combining all of our knowledge, we have designed a range of kitchenware so you could become a chef too - the Piedra Cocinar way.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t know how to cook, our team of in-house chefs creates picture-perfect food recipes weekly for you to try at home.</p>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563905040/ozwhrqofeneh4xvbfn8t.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/>The Most Delicious Way To Cook</h3>
<p>We believe that the best things come from simplicity - fire, stone, and organic groceries. You’d be surprised what a delicious and healthy combination these three components make. </p>
<p>Not to mention, you can cook absolutely anything on Piedra Cocinar kitchenware. Unlike with barbeque grills where your possibilities are limited, food does not dry out on our stone pans. They are specially created to lock in all the healthy juices within the foods. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1ceec0_dd9ea52b75614a929a4dd73d7eb53eb7~mv2.gif/v1/fill/w_1366,h_768/GIF-trumpas-steak.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>It Will Delight Your Guests</h3>
<p>Not only will your guests be impressed with how good of a chef you are (wink, wink), but they will also be impressed by the presentation as well. </p>
<p>Serve the food straight from a large “share la plancha” or separate “a piedra para cocinar” for each guest. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563905463/paxggxul0doqfxca2uzj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>It Helps You Slow Down And Enjoy The Moment</h3>
<p>Since the stone stays warm for a while, the food will also stay hot and moist. So you can wind down, take your time, and enjoy your meal like a true Mediterranean. No rush!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563905513/fykbxk8szluyjfhb87io.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>No Artificial Coatings</h3>
<p>It’s a well-known fact that overheated or scratched non-stick pans coated by PFOA or PFTE are toxic. In fact, birds die if they inhale PFTE. Humans can survive these intoxications, but the question is - do we want to? Just because we can survive doesn’t mean it’s not harmful. Just think about it - why buy expensive, organic groceries and toss them on to Perfluorooctanoic/Teflon coated pans? It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>We say no to artificial coatings and want to inspire you to do so too. The Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is eco-friendly, 100% recyclable, and artificial coating-free.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Handmade</h3>
<p>Made from gabbro diabase stone, hardwood handles, and lots of love, the Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is completely handmade in the UK. No slavery or kids labour involved in our production run. Just lots of passion and love for high-quality kitchenware, and a lifetime guarantee! <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1ceec0_b11d4f07221a47679a64bf75ff6f972a~mv2.gif/v1/fill/w_695,h_391/oil%20seasoning%20Piedra%20Cocinar.gif"" src=""""/>  </p>
<p>Expect these pans to be extremely long-lasting, as they are loaded with naturally-formed layers of metamorphic stone - which is composed of silt ore, shale, and volcanic ash compressed over millions of years. Not to mention, the hardwood handles are boiled in natural oils to give longevity, strength and to revive natural beauty. The result - a beautiful, eco-friendly, one-of-a-kind stone pan. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1ceec0_c0c6d8a608cc415a8ad0fdec2b8b023b~mv2.gif/v1/fill/w_695,h_450/Piedra-Cocinar-packing.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Please note this product is made from natural stone and wood, therefore you will find color and pattern variations in the stone and the wood due to the way the product is made.

</div></div>","Long Story Short
We wanted to make one of the oldest and healthiest cooking techniques - stone cooking - accessible to everyone. So, we created a stone pan with a little modern twist so it could be used anywhere and everywhere - from the heaters to straight on the dining table.


Healthy cooking. Delicious food. Long lasting. Retains heat. Eco-friendly materials. Good presentation. Even better price. 
 
The Bigger Picture
These days, in this fast-paced world, we are always in such a rush. Barely ever do we take the time to ourselves. From high-speed Internet, to fast food, to high-demand everything - we are always rushing through life when we really should be slowing down and enjoying it. 
So we, a group of food enthusiasts, teamed up with some of the best chefs in the world to create something that would help solve this problem of rushing. Something that would be your tool in healthy eating. Something that would allow you to use an ancient cooking method at home. Something that would bring the family together. Something that would impress your guests at your next backyard barbeque party. Something that would bring out your inner Betty Crocker even if you’re the worst chef in the world. And most importantly - something that would help you wind down and truly enjoy the food and company surrounding you.   

That something is Piedra Cocinar. A stone pan that takes us back to our roots and reminds us to slow down sometimes. 
Now, we know what you are thinking… What? Another cooking pan? Don’t we have enough of those on the market?
Well, this one is different. Isn’t that what they all say, though? But seriously. This pan takes us way back to our roots. 2000 years back. And reminds us to wind down, take our time, and enjoy the moment. 
Inspired by Mediterranean cooking and the Mediterranean lifestyle, we believe that every person should take the time to de-stress, slow down, and truly enjoy a home-cooked meal. Whether that would be every day or just once a week - Piedra Cocinar invites you to do that by helping you cook something truly special and keeping it warm for a long time.


Why Piedra Cocinar?
The Healthiest Way To Cook
It is well known that the Mediterranean diet is perhaps one of the healthiest diets in the world. From fighting inflammation, to reducing the risk for heart attack, stroke & Alzheimer’s disease, to encouraging healthy weight loss, to improving skin health - eating like a Mediterranean has been associated with endless health benefits.
Which is why we teamed up with the well-known chefs and Mediterranean food experts to bring the Piedra Cocinar project to life. Born in the small Spanish towns they continue their family cooking traditions that have been passed on generation to generation for hundreds of years. And their grandparents are living proof of the benefits of eating like a Mediterranean!
Mediterranean chef Santiago  - ‘’Yes, my grandma is over one hundred years old. She is still in good health and she is a very independent lady. And she still cooks daily. And what is most important - every time we sit around the table for a family dinner, she impresses us with something new. New aroma, new taste,’’ he smiles. ‘’Most people in our towns can expect to live longer, much longer than the World’s average’’.

 

It’s Not Another Cast Iron Skillet or Non-Stick Pan 
Don’t get confused here. The Piedra Cocinar pan is not just another cast iron skillet or non-stick pan. It is something completely different. It’s the thing you knew in the back of your head that your kitchen was missing. And once you try it, you won’t know how you ever lived without it! 
Unlike most pans and baking dishes, Piedra Cocinar is created with gabbro diabase (black marble) rather than metal or glass. Due to the thermal mass of the rock and the material's property food is less likely to burn on it.
Not to mention, for the first time in history, our Piedra Cocinar stone pans can be used anywhere and everywhere. It’s stone cooking taken to another level! The only exception - microwaves. But microwaves aren’t good for you anyway, so it’s a win-win. 


It Takes Us Back To Our Roots
Even though we would love to take all the credit, we can’t. We didn’t invent stone cooking - our ancestors did. All we did was make it accessible to everyone by creating a stone pan that can be used in any modern kitchen. And, we don’t want to brag, but we think it’s pretty awesome and our ancestors would be proud.
Created By Chefs
That pretty much says it all. You know, if it was created by chefs - it has to be good.
We are a team of Spanish and UK engineers, chefs, and food lovers. By combining all of our knowledge, we have designed a range of kitchenware so you could become a chef too - the Piedra Cocinar way.
Even if you don’t know how to cook, our team of in-house chefs creates picture-perfect food recipes weekly for you to try at home.

The Most Delicious Way To Cook
We believe that the best things come from simplicity - fire, stone, and organic groceries. You’d be surprised what a delicious and healthy combination these three components make. 
Not to mention, you can cook absolutely anything on Piedra Cocinar kitchenware. Unlike with barbeque grills where your possibilities are limited, food does not dry out on our stone pans. They are specially created to lock in all the healthy juices within the foods. 
It Will Delight Your Guests
Not only will your guests be impressed with how good of a chef you are (wink, wink), but they will also be impressed by the presentation as well. 
Serve the food straight from a large “share la plancha” or separate “a piedra para cocinar” for each guest. 

It Helps You Slow Down And Enjoy The Moment
Since the stone stays warm for a while, the food will also stay hot and moist. So you can wind down, take your time, and enjoy your meal like a true Mediterranean. No rush!

No Artificial Coatings
It’s a well-known fact that overheated or scratched non-stick pans coated by PFOA or PFTE are toxic. In fact, birds die if they inhale PFTE. Humans can survive these intoxications, but the question is - do we want to? Just because we can survive doesn’t mean it’s not harmful. Just think about it - why buy expensive, organic groceries and toss them on to Perfluorooctanoic/Teflon coated pans? It doesn’t make sense.
We say no to artificial coatings and want to inspire you to do so too. The Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is eco-friendly, 100% recyclable, and artificial coating-free.

 
Handmade
Made from gabbro diabase stone, hardwood handles, and lots of love, the Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is completely handmade in the UK. No slavery or kids labour involved in our production run. Just lots of passion and love for high-quality kitchenware, and a lifetime guarantee!   
Expect these pans to be extremely long-lasting, as they are loaded with naturally-formed layers of metamorphic stone - which is composed of silt ore, shale, and volcanic ash compressed over millions of years. Not to mention, the hardwood handles are boiled in natural oils to give longevity, strength and to revive natural beauty. The result - a beautiful, eco-friendly, one-of-a-kind stone pan. 
Please note this product is made from natural stone and wood, therefore you will find color and pattern variations in the stone and the wood due to the way the product is made. No two items are identical. Each and every item is unique. 
We like to believe that local is the new luxury nowadays. Products developed in Third-world countries can be found everywhere and are often bad quality, while handmade items are rarer and made with love. 

Honestly Priced
We believe that a healthy lifestyle should be accessible to everyone. Which is why our kitchenware is honestly priced. No gimmicks. No BS. Just a truly great cooking experience. 
In fact, believe it or not, our one-of-a-kind products handmade with love are cheaper than the ones made in developing countries. Pretty crazy, huh? We think so too.

<p>Our family has been operating Oasis without major renovations for the past 20 years. We have reached a point where our customer growth has far exceeded our ability to serve at a level we feel our customers deserve. We need a total inside-out restaurant transformation. Reaching our goal of $50,000 will allow us to remodel our indoor dining area and implement a much-needed kitchen renovation. We would like to purchase new chairs and tables, and create a more welcoming ambiance for our dine-in customers. Some of the major components of the kitchen renovation include; rebuilding our storefront order window for more efficient customer service, repairing or replacing all major commercial appliances (refrigerators/ovens/grills/drink dispensers/juicer etc.), fully repairing our commercial walk-in refrigerator (it's been used for storage for over 10 years!), and installing a new dishwashing system and sink so we can reuse real plates and silverware for dine-in orders. We also plan to increase our customer service and back-of-the-house staff to better support our increasing growth. Although we have a big goal, if we don't reach it, any amount of support will go towards enough of this renovation as we can possibly afford. </p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Your contribution</strong> <strong>and support</strong> in making this goal a reality will dramatically improve the quality, speed, and efficiency of our service to you and the community. This much needed boost will play a big role in the development of our company. Our big<strong> vision</strong> is to expand to multiple Inland Empire locations over the next few years, and this re-launch marks the beginning of that vision. </p>
<p>Now that our family team has come together to make this mission a reality, we feel more confident than ever that our collective talents and abilities will allow us to improve and grow Oasis to a level never reached before. </p>
<p>As we complete the improvements necessary for our current location, excess funds will be utilized for the opening of an upcoming second location that we are excited to announce very soon. All of this will be made possible with the continued support from our customers and the community.</p>

<h3><strong>Why change?</strong></h3> <p>Oasis has been a favorite for over 20 years. Why change? Put simply, times change. Information changes, as do the studies and findings that determine what truly nourishes us and helps us thrive.  We felt compelled to change our menu because we realized that improvements could be made in quality and consciousness. In recent years, we’ve discovered that highly processed veggie meats, GMO ingredients, and conventionally-grown vegetables can be detrimental to our family, and our customer’s health. We couldn’t possibly continue doing honest business knowing this. That’s when we decided to upgrade our menu to items we make ourselves; that way, we know EXACTLY what they’re made of! Now, we know we are serving you wholesome, healthy, and fresh plant-based cuisine. We make everything from scratch in-house, daily. We’ve requested that our suppliers bring us produce daily, so we can promise our customers the best and freshest ingredients possible. Everything is sourced with integrity and is non-GMO, organic when possible, and some ingredients are even sourced right in our very own neighborhood! So...why change? Well, how couldn’t we?</p> <h3><strong>How have we changed?</strong></h3> <p>Specifically, how have we changed? Previously, our menu was a plethora of Central-American classics, burgers, burritos, and a variety of drinks. We offered a variety of veggie meat substitutes that are created in factories and boast a long list of unpronounceable ingredients. We offered fried foods that you can get at any old fast-food joint like onion rings and fries. We made lots of things in house, but outsourced quite a bit of product. Although people loved our old menu, we struggled in our small kitchen to keep up with the vast menu and deeply knew that we could do and serve better.  </p> <p>We’ve changed our menu to be systemised and streamlined, yet customizable and fun. Customers select their vessel, so-to-speak, whether it be a bowl, burrito, salad, burger, or tacos, then, step-by-step, select the protein, veggie, and sauce to top it off. Our customers can find their favorite combination inspired-by their old-menu favorite or select a new combination every time they visit! Now, every option in every category is homemade. Our classic vegan steak, now named “carnitas,” has always been a favorite, our eggs are organic, our tofu is hand-marinated, non-GMO, and organic, and our Oasis Patty is our signature gluten-free veggie patty. Each of our veggie selections are delicious and our four new sauces are incredible. From our hearty and savory Red Pepper Sauce to our light and fresh Maple Herb Vinaigrette, we’ve got a sauce to fit every palate.</p> <p>Instead of pre-combined dishes like our “Steak Burger” or “Portobello Wrap,” our customers can now build their own favorites with our Garlic Herb Mushrooms or Carnitas. Since our menu is more streamlined, we can now focus on bringing out delicious and fresh flavors. The energy and resources we spent on fried foods and pre-made products is now redirected to preparing fresh ingredients like herbs, veggies, and fruits. Even our drinks and smoothies are made with whole fruits and veggies and sweetened naturally. Food preparation time has increased, but it’s worth it! As time goes on, wait times will decrease because of the simplified and streamlined menu.</p> <p>Long-time customers will notice a streamlined approach to our prices as well. $9 for a dish and $13 for a meal may seem different from what they’re accustomed to, but if they value our improvements and their health (and consider the average prices for a meal WITHOUT integrity in the area) they’ll realize that it simply makes sense. And, to avoid a picket line, we’ve kept some long-time favorite items like pupusas, tamales, and corn dog with that magic yellow sauce on a Classics menu.</p> <p>Oh, and our homemade hot sauce isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
</div></div>","We believe in serving food that we would feed our children. That’s why, when we opened Oasis Vegetarian Café in 1996, we vowed to provide our community with delicious, accessible, plant-based food. Being family-owned, we believe in operating a thriving business with integrity. Our driving force is love - for service and for good food. For over 20 years, we’ve watched our family, our community, and our business grow and evolve. Now more than ever, our mission is clear, and we believe it is vital to the health of our community.

Oasis is re-launching! We need our community's support to make much needed improvements and optimize our customer experience. 
 

Our family has been operating Oasis without major renovations for the past 20 years. We have reached a point where our customer growth has far exceeded our ability to serve at a level we feel our customers deserve. We need a total inside-out restaurant transformation. Reaching our goal of $50,000 will allow us to remodel our indoor dining area and implement a much-needed kitchen renovation. We would like to purchase new chairs and tables, and create a more welcoming ambiance for our dine-in customers. Some of the major components of the kitchen renovation include; rebuilding our storefront order window for more efficient customer service, repairing or replacing all major commercial appliances (refrigerators/ovens/grills/drink dispensers/juicer etc.), fully repairing our commercial walk-in refrigerator (it's been used for storage for over 10 years!), and installing a new dishwashing system and sink so we can reuse real plates and silverware for dine-in orders. We also plan to increase our customer service and back-of-the-house staff to better support our increasing growth. Although we have a big goal, if we don't reach it, any amount of support will go towards enough of this renovation as we can possibly afford. 
 

Your contribution and support in making this goal a reality will dramatically improve the quality, speed, and efficiency of our service to you and the community. This much needed boost will play a big role in the development of our company. Our big vision is to expand to multiple Inland Empire locations over the next few years, and this re-launch marks the beginning of that vision. 
Now that our family team has come together to make this mission a reality, we feel more confident than ever that our collective talents and abilities will allow us to improve and grow Oasis to a level never reached before. 
As we complete the improvements necessary for our current location, excess funds will be utilized for the opening of an upcoming second location that we are excited to announce very soon. All of this will be made possible with the continued support from our customers and the community.

<p>Our contributors could help us finalize a dream my Husband and I have had for years. We have worked very hard to get where we are and now could use a little help getting finished up.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is <i><strong>Karen O'Connell</strong></i>, I am an Australian native and I have been living in Southern California now for 16 years. I landed on US shores to help with the launch of a telecommunications company named Boost Mobile. I played an integral marketing role in the launch and roll out of the Australian, New Zealand and the USA markets. I know what it takes to build things from scratch and bring ideas from concept stage through to execution.</p>
<p>I am a single Mother with two daughters aged 12 and 10, and have lived an active healthy lifestyle from a very young age. I have always excelled athletically and currently love to run, cycle, do yoga, ski, and you might even catch me surfing a Wavestorm, or competing in a Spartan Race.</p>
<p>I love to challenge myself in all areas of life and continually push myself to test my limits. I also know what it's like to overcome life's obstacles along the way, and I've certainly been dealt my fair share. Metaphorically speaking, I live and breathe <i><strong>""Crank and Grind""</strong></i>, I understand success is not achieved without being knocked over a few times, or from lack of hard work.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516043907/yjuy1ikmbgtnxolr3ctm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My other passions are experiencing great coffee and great food. Yes, I would consider myself a ""foodie"" and eating a clean healthy diet is important to me, along with teaching my children the importance of adopting life long habits as it pertains to food and activity.</p>
<p>I have also made it my mission to continually educate ""American's"" on what good coffee should taste like, and steer them away from choosing milkshake containers of coffee, loaded up with  sugary syrups.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516047295/x0xfwiprqjwk11iz85rt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In 2007 I co-founded a bicycle retail chain named Bike Religion, and even though I enjoy cycling, selling and servicing bikes was not my passion. When the 3rd Bike Religion retail location opened up in Dana Point in 2012, my Australian partners and I seized an opportunity to open up a specialty coffee shop located in the same space and capitalize on serving great coffee and clean healthy foods influenced by our Aussie culture.</p>
<p>I spearheaded the launch of <i><strong>Crank and Grind  </strong></i>to open its doors on June 8, 2013 and within a few short months sold out of the bicycle business to become the sole proprietor of <strong><i>Crank and Grind. </i></strong>Cycling and coffee is not a foreign concept to Australians but to an iconic surf community like Dana Point they couldn't understand how we could possibly serve ""good coffee"" inside of a bike store. It has taken many years of enticing them to shift their mindsets but once they decide to step inside our doors, they are pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p><strong><i>My vision for Crank and Grind is to merge specialty coffee with a healthy active lifestyle! </i></strong>Whilst my brand may have began tied to a bicycle retailer, I see <i><strong>Crank and Grind</strong></i> evolving to be the coffee shop brand tied to health, wellness and other sporting activities like surfing or OCR and using my retail shops and product portfolio as a platform to strengthen community in varying lifestyle and sporting cultures.</p>

<h3>Current Financial Needs:</h3>
<p>I am currently seeking $100,000 in funding which will contribute to the following areas:<strong>- </strong></p>
<p>1. Paying off high interest unsecured small business loans that impact current cash flow</p>
<p>2. Ongoing operating capital to cover retail location rent and payroll</p>

<h3>How Your Contributions Will Help:</h3>
<p>In contributing to my campaign, you will enable me to continue to push forward to achieve my brand vision and goals, and relieve some stress of worrying about how I can get my business through the next week.</p>
<p>I believe in my vision and my abilities. I am not one to give up easy. I have persevered solely for 4 years and I am equipped with a great brand, the knowledge, the experience, the network and a proven concept and track record of successfully launching a business, products and brands. I just need the funding to keep me moving forward in a positive direction.</p>
<p>This is important to me because I believe I can strengthen community, provide a platform and a bridge that connects varying lifestyle and sporting cultures and help ""Americans"" adopt healthier habits with respect to how they consume coffee.

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about I AM WATER DROP. Growing up in Slovenia, I was fortunate to spend much of my childhood by water streams observing water in its most pristine form as it originated from the ground of the forest. I saw that I was one with the rest of nature, that everything was interconnected, and that my humanity depended on staying connected to that primordial sacred place of life.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517343706/w6qd271qnt5wd7rfkn9l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Already as a child, I worried that we would run out of clean water. Later in life I realized how extensively ignorance and greed are damaging our environment and that healing the waters requires more than the few superficial efforts to repair the damages we created. A more permanent solution requires us to resolve the problem in our current thinking, which is that we see ourselves separated from the rest of nature. I became convinced that it was essential to bring sensitivity to and respect for water to the “public” to help heal our physical, spiritual, and emotional separation from the rest of nature and to point out the falsity of water privatization and abuse.</p>
<p>As a philosopher and engineer, I decided to create a bottle with a strong social mission and to campaign for a more enlightened humanity by teaching about water and by offering an alternative to current water containers and the related marketing experience. I AM WATER DROP™ is a beautiful, natural water-drop shaped bottle created to inspire a more ecological humanity by promoting our relationship with the rest of nature and the delicacy of water that supports life. </p>

<p>I AM WATER DROP™ is an innovative concept and organic, nature-inspired design that offers a better alternative​ ​to​ other water containers in ​today's bottled water market. Through our design we aspire to:</p>
<p><strong>Honor Water With How We Serve It</strong></p>
<p>I AM WATER DROP™ is made out of durable glass and represents the profound beauty of the natural elements and energies in water. We based the shape on Viktor Schauberger’s theory of Sacred Living Geometry; that states the inherent movement, energy and life of water, like nature, is best supported, sustained and preserved in an egg-like shape.</p>
<p><strong>Create Beauty That Starts A Conversation  </strong></p>
<p>We believe that water is beautiful and we wanted our bottle to live up to that beauty. The bottle’s asymmetrical shape emulates the natural form (a droplet) that water takes and is both true to water and beautiful to perceive. It’s our hope that this design catches consumers’ attention, and drives a bigger conversation around water. </p>

<p>Centered around the vision of a sustainable environment, I AM WATER DROP™ seeks to change our habits and way of thinking through knowledge about water scarcity and quality. </p>
<p>We have made a voluntary commitment as part of the 2017 UN Ocean Stewardship to preserving and cleaning our oceans. Plans to maintain our commitment include supporting Plastic Bank (plasticbank.org) by dedicating a percentage of the sales from each I AM WATER DROP™ bottle, which will translate into the recycling and processing of approximately 400 to 700 discarded plastic bottles for every bottle sold. </p>
<p>In addition, sales of the bottle will be applied toward education about water and water rights as well as toward supporting water restoration projects such as removal of plastic from the ocean. </p>
<h3>Ready to Launch</h3>
<p>I AM WATER DROP was conceived years ago, but it took much effort to push through current limitations of mass producing glass in an organic art form, which was an important part of the mission. Over the course of this journey, I spent almost all of my personal funds, working with different designers and glass studios to achieve the design and finetune the engineering details.</p>
<p>I have now pulled together an amazing team comprising one of the best glass blowers in the world, engineering designers, and a branding team. The bottle has now reached the ultimate integrity in design, materials and mission. We have patiently and lovingly nurtured I AM WATER DROP™ from the initial stage of conception to this current phase and we hope to launch in the next month and to invite investors.</p>
<p>Expected costs for this essential pre-production stage, which includes a small run  of 100 of the bottle, package and silicone design and sampling, are more than I am able to cover. We need $30,000 now in order to produce and show the first samples to investors and potential buyers.</p>
<p>For our next phase we will need approximately $100,000 to cover the costs of the final tooling and silicone production; brand development, including the logo; final packaging design and creation; and marketing, including the sales team.</p>
<p>I know that many of you care deeply about water issues and I would like to invite you to join the mission of I AM WATER DROP™ and help support us at this important stage so that we can present the bottle to investors and potential buyers.</p>
<p>This campaign is also about uniting and offering like-minded individuals who share concern about the state of the world today--especially WATER, the source of life-- an opportunity to form a community that supports, financially and/or in spirit, the creation of a better world and a more enlightened and connected humanity.</p>
<p>It is my hope that I AM WATER DROP™ is brought soon to today's bottled water market so that it can begin to inspire and serve to help change practices. I AM WATER DROP™ is water speaking to us -- reminding us of our lost connection and holding us accountable for our actions.</p>
<p>To join us, please support I AM WATER DROP™ with a donation. We also welcome your help by asking you to share this campaign via your social media connections, networks, email and word of mouth, and by also encouraging your friends and colleagues to support us or spread the word.

Funds will also be used for start up packaging supplies, general production, e-commerce building and possible distribution set up costs.If we surpass our goal, we will use the extra funding towards converting our recipes into a full-blown commercial formulation. We will also use it towards looking for and leasing a smaller, retail location where we can have customers come in and buy products directly from us instead of only being able to order online.With your help, we hope to be able to transform our small operation into a bona fide commercial production and make our products available to health-conscious food lovers across the US.Quick Summary:
Need freezers, refrigerators, and equipment to help with the current 100% manual operation
Electrical upgrade for our unit
Display fridge
Ingredients in bulk
Packaging design work
Purchasing packaging material
E-commerce build out
Subsidizing shipping costs (shipping materials in bulk as well as shipping services)
Refrigerated van for deliveries
Partnering with commercial facilities to start bigger production on our bliss balls
Obtaining the proper FDA food labeling/ food certifications
The more money we raise, the more time and leeway we will have for:
Developing new flavors, designs, etc.
Expanding our own in-house production
Social initiatives and more sustainable operations
 Risks & ChallengesWe've come quite a ways in designing our products to reflect our company's core values: SIMPLE INGREDIENTS, WHOLE FOODS, and REAL INGREDIENTS. With that in mind, we face some conceivable (but solvable) challenges, such as:
Creating a viable manufacturing structure to allow meeting the market demand and growth while using a commercial manufacturing formulation with adherence to only natural ingredients. This is important to us and we are confident that we can make it happen.
Obtaining the proper FDA Food labeling/Food Certifications: There is an overabundance of food certifications (Organic, Non-GMO Project Verified, Gluten Free, Vegan etc) that we are looking into and we are quickly learning about the entire process of being certified.
Our plan is to source recyclable packaging, within the price point that is necessary in order to keep our products at a reasonable price. To this end, we may have to release our products to market with the goal of finding recyclable packaging within 5 years or sooner as we are committed to our eco-footprint on the Earth.
 Thank you for your support in giving us the opportunity to bring what we believe is a healthier and more honest option to the market! Special thanks to:Our families (Sholeh, Debi, Bill), Robert Berger (our amazing family friend and business advisor), Ivan Hulka (long time family friend and engineer extraordinaire), our incredible and loyal customers, and all our friends who have stood by us through cancelled plans after cancelled plans.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I’m Katia, my mission is to share my passion for wholesome and natural food - the way it should be - with the world! I have traveled and lived the corporate life in big cities such as Paris and NYC, but growing up, I spent every summer on a farm in Greece. From picking fresh eggs, to harvesting grapes to make wine, to milking sheep to make feta cheese, these are the memories that make up my childhood. Learning about the importance of freshness, appreciating homegrown produce, respecting nature are the values I grew up with. </p>
<p>The nostalgia of pureness and authenticity is what led me to embark on this journey and start <i>Greece in the Box</i>!</p>
<p>My mission is to help you enrich your meals with simple authentic ingredients. Greek food is special because it is wholesome and non-processed. Traditional farming practices have been kept for generations and the thousands of small farmers and producers in Greece understand the value of quality vs. quantity. I am also an avid believer that wellness should not come at a price and that proper nutrition and natural ingredients should be easily accessible to everyone!</p>
<p>The Mediterranean Diet is no secret! It is the best in the world thanks to a combination of eating habits and sourcing, but you don’t have to live in the Mediterranean in order to enjoy its benefits, <i>Greece in the Box</i> is bringing it directly to your table!</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Funding Goal</u> </strong></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Our funding goal is $20,000</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>. Your support will allow us to create a sustainable delivery system in order to automate processes for monthly deliveries, setup a logistics center in Northern Europe in order to be closer to our customers, setup our online subscription site, expand to all-natural non-food related products such as beauty products, soaps, facial creams, baby products, and most importantly to spread the Mediterranean way of living.</span></p>
<p><u><strong>Our Unique Perks</strong></u></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Our perks are unique, 100% natural products from all over Greece. Your daily meals will be enriched through authentic and deep flavors with ingredients that enhance your health and wellness. You most probably won't be able to find them anywhere outside of Greece. And if you do, they certainly won't be cheap! </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Are you a Greece lover? Planning a trip to Greece this summer? Another exciting perk is that we are offering unique culinary tours in Greece! Live like a Greek for a day or a week! From Athens to the Greek islands, we are planning hands-on experiences on combining food with travel.</span></p>
<p><u><strong>If we Don't Reach our Goal </strong></u></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>In the unfortunate case we do not reach our entire goal, we will still be able to meet our fulfillment requirements as our crowdfunding campaign does not depend on collective funding in order to deliver the end product.</span></p>
<p>We will of course have a shortfall on our general investment, but this will also be the determining factor on whether we will be able to proceed with establishing a delivery service or not.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>CHANGE. This is the impact we want to make to the food industry and to consumer habits. We want to change the industry and allow for pure and natural local products to become easily accessible at a fair price! We believe it is our duty.</p>
<p>Authentic sourcing, supporting traditional farming practices, food freshness, seasonality, and small-farm economics are at the heart of our work.</p>
<p>While the Mediterranean cuisine is globally renowned for its health properties and distinct flavors – the way locals eat and appreciate food, which makes all the difference, is not as widespread. Eating healthy can be simple, delicious and affordable! We want to be leading global advocates of the Mediterranean Diet and it’s health properties.</p>
<p>Our Impact reflects our values:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Quality:</strong> Our number one priority is to always provide the best products Greece has to offer. Sourcing from the best!</li>
<li>
<strong>Partnership: </strong>We believe that strong partnerships in any kind of work is key to success. Our partners are part of our team. We aim to empower hard working and small family-run businesses in order to create a sustainable means for Greek farming and artisanal production to grow and prosper.</li>
</ol>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong><u>Box Safety:</u></strong></p>
<p>We have conducted months of testing on box deliveries. Since most of the products in the box are in glass jars or bottles, our main priority is that all of the products arrive safe and intact. Testing has allowed us to be very careful with our wrapping while keeping an elegant look, we believe we have found the solution and that all boxes will arrive safe and sound.</p>
<p><strong><u>Fulfillment:</u></strong></p>
<p>Should this Indiegogo campaign be a massive success, we will need to get smart about how we are sourcing; we do not want to cut corners on quality. We have partnered with some great farms and producers, have worked with them in great detail, and are confident we will be able to fulfill all demands.</p>
<p><strong><u>Shipping Risks:</u></strong></p>

<p>        Pioneer Food Truck &amp; Catering Co. is a collaboration between myself; Jean-Luc Matecat, and my fiancee Lindsay Taylor. Together we've set out to open a food truck that embodies our love of exciting dishes from around the world, the incredible foods found here in our home state of Vermont, and finally our dedication to having the best customer service that we possibly can. We recognize that is ALL about making the customers happy and coming back, and thats what we've set out to do with Pioneer.</p>
<p>       I've been in the restaurant business for over twenty years from Dishwasher to Executive Chef, and Lindsay matches my passion for food with her dedication to customer service, and front of house talent. We will bring our individual experiences, and shared entrepreneurial spirit to our business. This funding will allow us to accomplish the remaining projects that we need to finish, in order to be open on schedule for this season. We've come so far, and this would help provide that final push! We have a fundraising goal of 5,000 dollars that would cover the three remaining expenses required for us to open, these will be outlined below. We've done an exceptional job of keeping expenses low during the opening of our business.  By supporting this last fundraising stage of our opening,  you will help our vision transcend from a longtime dream into reality. We'll launch the food truck from our home here in Mallett's Bay, where we also have started our micro farm that will supply the truck with primarily herbs, flowers, and a few fun vegetables! </p>
<p>       Our Campaign will sell a combination of Perks, with a goal of raising $5000 dollars. These Perks come in the form of ""Pioneer Coppers"". These Coppers are available in a variety of denominations, with the deal getting better and better with higher increments. The ""Vermont Coppers"" are a playful nod to Vermonts first official State Currency first used in 1785. Each ""VT Copper"" will have a value of $1USD, and can be used to purchase any food, or merchandise from Pioneer Food Truck. This will allow us to not only raise money but, also bring patrons to the truck where they can sample our food. This will hopefully create return customers, and help spread the word of what we're doing. These Perks are a great incentive because in addition to helping us open up, all of you supporters can get some really delicious food, for a great deal!</p>
<p>      These funds raised from this Campaign will be applied to 3 major areas:  1-Purchase the vinyl graphics necessary to complete our rebranding of the truck. 2-Cover legal fees for state, and city vending requirements. 3-Purchase our opening inventory of food, and paper goods to begin vending immediately. To elaborate, first off the lettering &amp; graphics will allow the truck to be spotted and identified easily. This is essential for the development of our brand, and will help attract customers and increase sales. Secondly the vending/operating fees will allow us access to premium spots and events throughout our community, which will greatly improve our revenue stream. Lastly the capital for opening inventory would allow us to launch %100 stocked, and fully prepared to start fully prepared to serve as many meals as possible from day one.</p>
<p>Using our combined experience, and strong work ethic we've striven to eliminate as many of the challenges in our path as possible, and now turn to our community to help us with our final strides to open. We couldn't do it without the support of patrons, friends, and family and we want to thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. Even if you aren't purchasing Coppers a simple share of this page will help. We so look forward to cooking for you very soon, Happy Trails!</p>

In addition to culinary skills, instruction in business development, marketing, and large scale food production will help prepare students for a wide variety of careers upon graduation.In-house Culinary Skill Hours further hone students' culinary prowess, while an independent Culinary Externship allows students to have hands-on experience in the area of their choice: as a personal chef or caterer, in a natural food restaurant, for a community kitchen, at a retreat center, in a cooking class, and more.""http://www.baumancollege.org/programs/natural-chefWhat I Need & What You Get:Here's the breakdown:
$10,000 would cover over half of the tuition. If I reach more than the expected goal, (dare to dream!) then I would use it for books and the remaining tuition. 
The perks are based on my years of experience as a nutritionist and are designed to serve your health and busy schedules.
If I don't raise the full 10k I will still move forward in enrollment and continue to work hard to fund the rest of the tuition. I am driven to make this happen!
WHY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT ME...
I love food but I don't care for the food industry. Food has lost it’s way. We live in an age where fast food and toxic foods dominate our shelves and bodies. I’m not out to make war with the food industry...but I’m making effort to reduce its dominance, one group at a time.
I will gain confidence in not only my abilities as a chef, but as someone with the tools to help heal and support a wide range of clients.
Natural Chefs are in great demand as our society realizes and needs guidance toward healthy food, nourishment and lifestyle.
This program is the launching pad for a future using food as a therapeutic source to be combined with my nutrition expertise.
This program will provide me with the tools to build a  deeper health-centered career.
OTHER WAYS TO HELPSome people can’t contribute financially, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help. So even if you love my idea but lack the resources to pledge to its success, you can still help. Sharing on social media and with friends and family who would benefit from the perks would be greatly appreciated.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We want to do something different. We want to make an amazing nitro cold brew coffee and bring it to the Vallejo and surrounding communities in a fun way. That’s why we started Up Bay Coffee Pedalers, a literal bicycle built for brew.<br/><br/>Our idea is to bring nitro cold brew coffee to the people as a way to connect, live, and enjoy coffee together wherever we are in the moment.<br/><br/>We started by working with local roasters to develop custom blends for our cold brew base. Cold brew is the process of steeping coffee slowly, over a period of 18-24 hours in cold, filtered water. Cold brewing extracts a deep, flavorful coffee concentrate that is lower in acidity, less bitter, and smoother than traditional hot brewing. By adding nitrogen to the coffee, it creates a creamier, full-bodied mouth feel that has enough sweetness that brings out the bean’s individual character and adds sweetness, so there’s no need to add cream or sugar.<br/><br/>Our unique brews will be small-batch handcrafted and will highlight the incredible roasters we have in the Bay Area.<br/><br/>Here's what they're already saying about our cold brew!</p>
<p> <i>""Distinct flavor. No Bitterness. Enjoyable!""  "" I'm a fan!""  ""Great flavor"" ""More extraction, fuller and richer.""""Super smooth and strong."" ""I liked the finish.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Gisele, I've been an entrepreneur owning and operating local businesses to serve my home town of Erie, PA since 1999. I'm excited to share with you my vision for unique, internationally inspired coffees and teas, as well as locally crafted liquor, wine and beer set in a cozy, casual, and entertaining space. Located in the historic Federal Hill district of downtown, I've chosen to make my roots here to be an integral part of the revitalization efforts of this eclectic neighborhood and to be a mainstay in the community as a gathering place for great commentary, discussion, poetry, art, and acoustic entertainment.</p>
<p>With your help we can bring much needed diversification to Erie's social venue scene. A place where families feel welcome and friends can connect without compromising on either/or...you know: either find a sitter and get wine, or bring the kids and get coffee; either listen to music and can't talk to each other, or able to talk but not with music and beer. I believe we should be able to enjoy ANY beverage at ANYtime with ANYbody we want, while enjoying live, local talent. Help me make this dream a reality!  </p>

Many local businesses are already coming to our aid, offering discounted services and cost saving resources to utilize our fund raising as effectively and extensively as possible!</p>
<p>The perks I'm offering are as fun and unique as our cafe will be! I'm offering a variety of options that will appeal to everyone, regardless if you are passionate about coffee, tea, espresso, wine, beer, liquors, incredible pastries or merchandise. There is something for everybody to enjoy at the Tipsy Bean!</p>
<p>I believe we will be overwhelmed by the support of our community, but if in the unlikely event that we do not reach our $$ goal you can be assured we will still open and have you enjoying those perks next month. We have our list of needs and necessities prioritized so that it allows for us to use the funds that do come to have us open in November and complete the updating work while in operation.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Erie is in the process of recreating it's identity and making strides to be a start-up friendly, tech savvy, locally sourced and supported community making solutions for international challenges. These are exciting times for homesteaders and transplants alike, but to entice people to stay or relocate here to continue the progressiveness we need to become the city that is also known for it's great social environment, inclusivity, diversity and dedication to artistic expression.</p>
<p>The Tipsy Bean is a major component, in a strategic location, that will help create this shift for our city's identity. I want to utilize my experience in leading cooperative efforts by being at the forefront of collaborating with other local cafe's (and other supporting industry businesses) to establish diverse social and experiential opportunities for residents.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Transitioning out of the military was one of the hardest things I have ever done. Dealing with PTSD in a new environment proved to be difficult and I felt out of place. I wanted to find that sense of brotherhood again, but I dealt with a generational gap everywhere I went. My college classmates were a decade younger than I was, and we had nothing in common. The American Legion and VFW's were filled with service members old enough to be my parents; I was lost. One thing I knew was I wanted to open a brewery and now had even more motivation. Opening Charlie Foxtrot Brewing is my way of trying to help others not feel like I did during my transition. Offering a place where that brotherhood is experienced by everyone. Charlie Foxtrot is about more than just beer, it is about people and what we can do to help each other.  </p><p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p><p>Charlie Foxtrot Brewing is a veteran owned brewery coming to North Port, Florida. Founders Nicolas York and Timothy Price met while deployed to Afghanistan in 2012. Nicolas was an infantryman and Timothy was the medic assigned to the platoon. Their experiences are what drives the mission for Charlie Foxtrot Brewing, raising awareness and funds for non-profits that work with the mental issues service members deal with. Currently 22 veterans commit suicide every day, through personal experience we have identified that the transition out of the military is a huge factor in these numbers.</p><p>Our goal is to create an environment that brings a sense of community to everyone, once you walk in the door you are family. The brotherhood that creates a bond between people so deep they are willing to do anything for each other, knowing someone always has your six. Even though we have a strong military focus we want to ensure everyone feels this way. Knowing that mental health issues affect more than just service members and needs to be a topic people feel comfortable talking about.</p><p>This campaign will allow us to obtain that goal and start to change the attitude towards mental health issues. While bringing a fun, community-based brewery for you to gather with us. Your contributions will allow us to open our doors and start to create that sense of community.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>Charlie Foxtrot Brewing is raising $70,000 through this campaign. $60,000 is the amount needed to secure the loan which will be used for equipment, furnishings, kegs, tap handles, and initial ingredients. The additional $10,000 will go towards service fees, perk purchases, and perk shipping. If unable to reach our goal funds will be used to fulfill perks and the remaining will go towards the $60,000 needed to secure the loan.</p><p>We are offering two types of perks for you to choose from, 11 personal perk levels and 3 business sponsorship levels.</p><p>Perks range from The Private to The General, which is a way for you to honor someone special in your life who also loves beer. We will share their story during tours of the brewery (if you would like) and have the 250-word plaque pointed out. This is another way for us to create that sense of community.</p><p>Share your love for Charlie Foxtrot Brewing by showing off your merchandise! You can even have a private party with your choice of keg!</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Charlie Foxtrot Brewing has partnered with The 22 Project in Delray, Florida to help support their mission of healing veterans. Not only are they providing medical treatment to veterans, but they are advocating on the behalf of veterans to the Veterans Affairs Administration. Helping push for alternative treatments and better treatment. We have created the 22 Troop Lager which will have 22% of profits donated to the organization to help them treat more veterans.</p><p>So far, we have had 7 beer recipes tested and completed to perfection for your enjoyment. We have won business pitch competitions with the Florida Veterans Program that has allowed us to get to where we are now. We are looking forward to being a part of the North Port community and getting involved with local organizations we can help support. We have already started to work on collaborations with 5 local businesses and are excited for even more collaborations.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Like any small business there are always risks and challenges to get started and be successful. As the world is being affected by the Coronavirus pandemic, we have all been impacted. Even though we are not open, we too have been impacted as construction times have been pushed back and financial backers have had to reallocate their funds. So that is why we are trying to gain your support and help inspire the community with brighter things to come!</p><p>We have started to work with the city of North Port on the regulations and requirements for us to open the brewery.

Dealing with PTSD in a new environment proved to be difficult and I felt out of place. I wanted to find that sense of brotherhood again, but I dealt with a generational gap everywhere I went. My college classmates were a decade younger than I was, and we had nothing in common. The American Legion and VFW's were filled with service members old enough to be my parents; I was lost. One thing I knew was I wanted to open a brewery and now had even more motivation. Opening Charlie Foxtrot Brewing is my way of trying to help others not feel like I did during my transition. Offering a place where that brotherhood is experienced by everyone. Charlie Foxtrot is about more than just beer, it is about people and what we can do to help each other.  Short SummaryCharlie Foxtrot Brewing is a veteran owned brewery coming to North Port, Florida. Founders Nicolas York and Timothy Price met while deployed to Afghanistan in 2012. Nicolas was an infantryman and Timothy was the medic assigned to the platoon. Their experiences are what drives the mission for Charlie Foxtrot Brewing, raising awareness and funds for non-profits that work with the mental issues service members deal with. Currently 22 veterans commit suicide every day, through personal experience we have identified that the transition out of the military is a huge factor in these numbers.Our goal is to create an environment that brings a sense of community to everyone, once you walk in the door you are family. The brotherhood that creates a bond between people so deep they are willing to do anything for each other, knowing someone always has your six. Even though we have a strong military focus we want to ensure everyone feels this way. Knowing that mental health issues affect more than just service members and needs to be a topic people feel comfortable talking about.This campaign will allow us to obtain that goal and start to change the attitude towards mental health issues. While bringing a fun, community-based brewery for you to gather with us. Your contributions will allow us to open our doors and start to create that sense of community.What We Need & What You GetCharlie Foxtrot Brewing is raising $70,000 through this campaign. $60,000 is the amount needed to secure the loan which will be used for equipment, furnishings, kegs, tap handles, and initial ingredients. The additional $10,000 will go towards service fees, perk purchases, and perk shipping. If unable to reach our goal funds will be used to fulfill perks and the remaining will go towards the $60,000 needed to secure the loan.We are offering two types of perks for you to choose from, 11 personal perk levels and 3 business sponsorship levels.Perks range from The Private to The General, which is a way for you to honor someone special in your life who also loves beer. We will share their story during tours of the brewery (if you would like) and have the 250-word plaque pointed out. This is another way for us to create that sense of community.Share your love for Charlie Foxtrot Brewing by showing off your merchandise! You can even have a private party with your choice of keg!The ImpactCharlie Foxtrot Brewing has partnered with The 22 Project in Delray, Florida to help support their mission of healing veterans. Not only are they providing medical treatment to veterans, but they are advocating on the behalf of veterans to the Veterans Affairs Administration. Helping push for alternative treatments and better treatment. We have created the 22 Troop Lager which will have 22% of profits donated to the organization to help them treat more veterans.So far, we have had 7 beer recipes tested and completed to perfection for your enjoyment. We have won business pitch competitions with the Florida Veterans Program that has allowed us to get to where we are now. We are looking forward to being a part of the North Port community and getting involved with local organizations we can help support. We have already started to work on collaborations with 5 local businesses and are excited for even more collaborations.Risks & ChallengesLike any small business there are always risks and challenges to get started and be successful. As the world is being affected by the Coronavirus pandemic, we have all been impacted. Even though we are not open, we too have been impacted as construction times have been pushed back and financial backers have had to reallocate their funds. So that is why we are trying to gain your support and help inspire the community with brighter things to come!We have started to work with the city of North Port on the regulations and requirements for us to open the brewery. We have had great support so far and expect that to continue as we submit special exemption requests and apply for federal licenses. We are determined to open in North Port and have felt immense appreciation so far from every community member we have spoken too. If opening gets pushed back, we will continue to do everything to open in North Port.  We are determined to bring Good Deeds, Great Beer, and Fun Times to this city!Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you are unable to financially support there are several ways you can still help us!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All the funding will go in the drink production. We need to be able to produce massive quantity of the product.

<p>You are important to us, this is why we have created discounted and rewarding perks. We care for our backers, the shipping costs are a big issue when it comes to heavy quantities, so we have put in place a special refunding way. Since bigger is the quantity we have to ship in a certain country kess will be the related costs, then we will provide you, if we are able to save costs in the shipping, product vouchers equal to the savings so that you can have back what you, eventually, overpaid for the shipping.</p>
<p>If we should not reach the £15000 goal, then we will refund the money. Chentos final goal is to share this drink with the world and we need your help. Trust is important to us, let's celebrate together a healthier day.</p>

Many business owners told us that after asking around to find who had the best gluten free products in Austin our name was consistently at the top of the list. We built our business little by little by selling some products and buying more equipment. That worked for several years. But now, as we approach 50 accounts, our product line has greatly expanded to include sweets and other delectable delights and we have reached the limit of what we can produce in our current kitchen. Fortunately, we have found a new kitchen where we will have twice the space and unlimited access. The problem is that this new kitchen does not come with the basic appliances we need.

We firmly believe that our food can help change the world by bringing people together to share a meal. With your help, we can accomplish our mission of changing the world one meal at a time.</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Our project/product is food hand-crafted to perfection. Big Chuck’s offers a variety of roller options wrapped in vegan egg roll wraps that include breakfast, lunch and dinner options. We will also have sides to go with the rollers if our customers choose; our famous Mac and Cheese and/or coleslaw. We have checked, and no one surrounding our local areas are doing what we do, nor do they have our award-winning mac and cheese that is a popular favorite here in the South. We prepare our food fast, and have face-to-face interaction with our customers (masks on of course and 6-ft apart). Our reviews on Facebook and Instagram from our customers boast of the same high quality great tasting meal time and time again. We have tested this food all around Charlotte and surrounding areas in church functions, workplaces and neighbors as well as family and friends across the U.S. who all agree with our reviews. In our testing, we discovered what worked and what didn't and went back to the drawing board until we found exactly what was needed or needing to be removed.

So in what ways could anyone overcome these kinds of hurdles? We turn to you to help get the word out about us and what we offer. We believe our food speaks for itself, which is why we already have a good clientele-base, however because of these trying times, there is a domino effect that affects us all when it comes to income coming in. But more people who know about us, means more people who are likely to try our product, and share the word more. There is power in numbers, and we need more of it!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aside from the revolving door of the pandemic, we know there are also other factors that could play out, for example our equipment needing to be fixed. We do have a mechanic/maintenance employee who knows how to fix anything that could break, so there are no real troubling hurdles there. </strong></p>
<p><strong>When our business gets going, the ratio of buying our materials to selling our product is not one we have ANY concern about. We buy in bulk and save so much more as we sell, sell, sell! We have a plan for savings for any emergencies we may run into, we have established every possible scenario that we could encounter and have a back up plan.

After decades of working in various aspects of the hospitality industry we are thrilled to bring our experience to the community we grew up in and love while honoring the memory of the greatest restauranteur we have ever know, our very own ""Red Jet"", Nancy Zabel.

</div></div>","Hi! We are the Zabel's - Jeremy and Nicole. 

We have been presented with the opportunity to reopen the Skyroom at Lampson Field! After decades of working in various aspects of the hospitality industry we are thrilled to bring our experience to the community we grew up in and love while honoring the memory of the greatest restauranteur we have ever know, our very own ""Red Jet"", Nancy Zabel. She gave us so many of the characteristics we now consider our greatest values : work ethic, commitment to our local community, and always, ALWAYS doing the right thing for our family, our business, our customers and our environment.  
We can't wait to open and operate RED’S @ the Skyroom, a full service, family run bar & grill at Lampson Field’s iconic Skyroom Restaurant.
Jeremy Zabel is a prominent local chef with a diverse culinary background. He began his career as a dishwasher at the age of 14 at his family’s restaurant and by the time he was 18 he had made his way to lead cook. Jeremy worked as head chef for 5 years at Park Place where his passion for sourcing local ingredients began. He was offered the Executive Chef position at the Saw Shop in Kelseyville in 2006. After a 10-year tenure with the Saw Shop, Jeremy made the move to Napa and worked as the Executive Chef at Hog Island Oyster Company.
Partner and wife, Nicole Zabel has 19 years of experience in the hospitality industry. Her experience includes serving in full-service restaurants, diners, and cafes in both Northern and Southern California, event planning and execution, and managing full-service hotels including the Andaz in Napa and Hyatt House in Emeryville.

<p>Above all, maintain an intense love for each other, since love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without complaining. (1 Peter 4:8-9)</p>
<p>If you’ve visited the team at The Orangery you will know that they welcome you with the kindest of hearts, warmest of welcomes and hospitality in abundance.  Through their hard work they have provided this community with a place to gather for great conversations, food, cocktails and family events…anyone remember the real Santa that visited us at Xmas…anyone remember the Summer music festival or the many family events you may have attended?? </p>

<p>This unprecedented situation will put local family businesses like The Orangery under a tornado of financial pressure. We would be very grateful if you would consider helping to support our team and their families (our team of 19 have 22 little one’s mouths to feed) by placing a deposit for a wedding or a future event with the purchase of an Orangery gift voucher or three, buying a virtual hug, buying a cocktail masterclass for a future date with friends or having your own personal cocktail menu designed to help us continue to run our business through these difficult times.  A £20 voucher from just 1% of the Redditch population will help to keep many of our team in their job through these troubling times...and a massive bonus is you’ll have something pretty awesome to look forward to when we get back to normality.</p>

<h3>How it All Started </h3>
<p>During my first visit to Mexico in 2017, upon seeing chocolate being made right in front of my eyes in the same place it has been made for over 2000 years; I immediately made up my mind to begin learning everything I could about chocolate.</p>
<p>In 2018 my journey started. I began studying and experimenting with techniques in chocolate making. With friends and family as delighted test subjects I was able to fine tune each stage of crafting incredible chocolate. As my technique continued to improve, I began receiving specific requests for fun, interesting, and often times wild flavors. Dark chocolate, strawberries and balsamic vinegar reduction; dark chocolate, banana and vanilla bean; white chocolate, key lime pie; milk chocolate, orange caramel with chile pepper; milk chocolate, chocolate chip toffee cookie. I decided from then on, that I would stop trying to guess what people like, and instead let them tell me what they like. </p>
<h3>Chocolate crafted just the way you want. Every. Little. Detail.</h3>
<p>The process begins with your idea. We help evolve it into a finished bar by listening, asking questions, and, offering our expert advice and suggestions. Many people find it surprising that making a chocolate bar has many unseen variables. These require expertise and experience to get just the right results. Sourcing the cacao direct from the farm, roasting, refining and conching(a long process of agitating the chocolate to achieve the ideal flavor) are all challenges to master and each an opportunity for excellence. </p>
<h3>Funds Allocation</h3>
<p>Proceeds from this campaign will directly fund a  website, specialized equipment that will save time and enable us to handle larger quantities and expand our business.</p>
<p>-New and larger roaster </p>
<p>-Multiple Grinders</p>
<p>-Tempering Machine</p>
<p>-Website</p>
<p>Since we have all the equipment necessary to fulfill  small orders, should we not meet our goal we will be able to fulfill all orders. The money raised will go towards new and more efficient equipment in the future</p>
<h3>Quality and Integrity Without Compromise         </h3>
<p>Before ever beginning the journey into chocolate making, I was passionate about good chocolate. Having such a love for chocolate, I was able to appreciate all the difference that quality makes in the end product. A large part of making great chocolate is using the best ingredients without compromise. Each lot of cacao is quality checked by us before ever leaving the farm.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Produced in Mexico Means Greater Positive Impact for the Local Community</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602819997/medumuazfg0rupg0yjmu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Not only will your pledge help us grow as the world's only custom chocolate maker,  we also pay a fair price for our cacao which greatly helps farming communities. We know that chocolate greatly relies on manual labor, therefore intrinsic to great chocolate are happy and well-paid employees who do their work lovingly and with care.</p>

<p><i>The wider, flatter bar is ideal for non gooey,creamy, decadent bars, but can have a little filling. The long, thinner bar is ideal for the more gooey, creamy, decadent bars. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If at any step you are unsure, let us know and we will guide you in creating the perfect bar. For example If you know that you want something with apple, but don't know how exactly. We would suggest adding cinnamon and nutmeg, buttery pie crust bits and apple pieces for a delicious apple pie bar. Or maybe instead, apple infused caramel with peanuts for a decadent take on the classic caramel dipped apples. The variations are limitless. It all depends on what sounds best to you, and of course the final decision is yours.</p>

<h2><strong>Did you know that between 2010-2019, one in five Japanese sake breweries disappeared.</strong></h2>
<p>Not because their sake was bad. Many of these have history dating back centuries, back to when Japan was a feudal society.</p>
<p>But why then? After all, don’t they sell for a <i>pretty good price</i>, especially outside of Japan?</p>
<p>As sake lovers - we did our research. And the number one answer was …</p>
<h2><strong>“We can’t earn”</strong></h2>
<p>F&amp;B outlets pressure middlemen, middlemen pressure each other and the last middlemen pressure the breweries. 99.6% of breweries are SMEs which can produce the best sake in the world, but don’t have much bargaining power.</p>
<p>In fact, the more meticulous the brewery, the better the sake. But subsequently, the smaller the production amount and the brewery has an even harder time resisting pressure to slash prices.</p>
<p>Right now, you’re going to see an inflated price tag anyway. That amount you’re paying? Out of that on the average bottle the brewery may get a few dollars. For brewing an alcohol that is probably the most labor intensive in the world and which demands exceeding meticulousness.</p>
<h3><strong>There must be a better way</strong></h3>
<p>Many of the breweries are soldiering on out of love for the craft but we think that they <strong>should</strong> earn.</p>
<p>They <strong>must</strong> for sake to live on.</p>
<p>This is why we, a team of Sake lovers, are working with the Takenoi brewery (武の井酒造), to create a custom line of sake brewed for the Singaporean taste.</p>
<p>No middlemen, delivered straight to you without a restaurant gouging you. Obama brewery is also getting a far more reasonable price for their work <strong>and </strong>profit sharing.</p>
<p>This sake isn't coming at an unreasonable price either. More details below but this is an ultra-premium brew at a very reasonable price in Singapore.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>Read on for more details - if this is a success then we can work with more breweries on similar project. We hope that you join us on Haru’s mission to preserve sake and make sake sustainable.</p>
<p>And <i>Kampai!</i></p>
<h3>About the Sake</h3>
<p>The quality of a sake is determined heavily by the quality of the rice and water used in making it and the mastery of the artisans involved.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>Careful choice has been placed in all elements of the sake. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The water is from an underground river under the Yatsugatake mountain range (八ヶ岳山麓). This water source is certified as one of the top 100 water sources in Japan (名水百選) </li>
<li>The rice used will be the Special Grade (特等) <i>Yamada-nishiki</i> (山田錦)</li>
<li>The yeast used is derived from the Sakura flower.</li>
<li>As an added bonus gold leaf reminiscent of floating sakura petals will be added to the alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Artistry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Takenoi</i> is one of the only 30 breweries among the 1400 which are able to use flower-based yeasts in their fermentation.</li>
<li>The brewmaster himself aside from being the 6th generation in a long line of sake-brewers also studied sake-brewing academically in his university times.</li>
<li>Our <i>sake</i> is classified as a <i>Junmai Daiginjo </i>(純米大吟醸), which is generally considered to be the top grade of sake available with well less than 2% of all sake falling into this category.</li>
<li>Our <i>sake</i> has an extremely high polish rate of 29%, where 71% of the rice grain is milled away, leaving only the purest core which is responsible for producing superior aroma and taste.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contributions (thank you!) will be going to the process of bringing the alcohol to Singapore including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The costs of producing the alcohol</li>
<li>Costs for preparing the necessary food safety documentation etc.</li>
<li>Shipping the alcohol to Singapore</li>
<li>Alcohol taxes in Singapore</li>
<li>Storage and other logistics in Singapore</li>
</ul>
<p>In return, we will bring to you directly the number of bottles you ordered and other rewards depending on how much you have contributed<i>. </i>The per bottle price that you are contributing here will be lower than how much it goes to retail for.</p>
<p>Don't forget that this sake makes for a good present, and can be used for corporate events too!</p>
<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>
<p>We expect to make the sake available by April 2021. Due to Indiegogo rules, we are committing to physically delivering the sake to you. Alternatively, you can also pick it up from us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Success with Takenoi will give us an example to approach more breweries in Japan, and bring more commissioned hidden <i>sake</i> gems to Singapore.</p>
<p>Many of these traditional breweries are facing an uphill battle to survive. First, they are unable to compete with larger breweries that have decided to focus on quantity, and profit margins. Second, in many cases, they lack market volume as they do not have the ability to bring their <i>sake</i> overseas without assistance. Due to this, traditional sake brewing is a dying craft in Japan, with many traditional techniques responsible for producing superior <i>sake</i> on the verge of being lost.</p>
<p>By making this project a success, we want to show that there are people (like you and us) in the world who do appreciate good <i>sake</i>. By doing so, we will prove that in this day and age, tradition remains important, and that the craft that goes into making <i>sake</i> should be preserved.</p>
<p><i>Sake</i> brewing is a craft that deserves to be passed down, and we hope to play our part in this.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As of now, production is on track but unexpected events (such as a typhoon) can disrupt production.</p>
<p>The situation with COVID-19 may cause issues, although shipping between Japan and Singapore remains stable, and on schedule.</p>
<p>In the case of disruption from any of the above events, we will inform backers of any changes in batch size or delays. If necessary, we will issue the appropriate refunds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you're not sure whether you can immediately contribute, you can help us still!</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing through social media, especially with your friends who enjoy sake;</li>
<li>Subscribing to our <a href=""https://eepurl.com/g_FG_L"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mailing list</a> for more updates and news</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are an F&amp;B outlet who wants to know more, feel free to contact us at  <a href=""mailto:%20contact@harusake.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact@harusake.com</a> too.</p>
<p>Anyway, we wish to thank all of our supporters in advance! As it customary in Japan when drinking, let us wish everyone a very happy KAMPAI (乾杯)!</p>
</div><h3>About Obama Shuzo</h3><p>The Takenoi Brewery was established in 1865. It is located in Hokuto City, in Yamanashi Prefecture.</p><p>As of present, six generations of the founding family have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of the perfection of their craft. The staff at the Takenoi Brewery feels great satisfaction at being able to work in conjunction with nature to bring smiles to those who drink the sake they go to painstaking extents to perfect.</p><p>The Takenoi Brewery is notable for being one of 30 breweries, out of more than 1400 breweries in Japan, to be approved to use yeast derived from roses in the production of its sake. It is set further apart from the competition by being the only brewery that uses rose-derived yeast sake of the junmai daiginjo class.</p><p>This is represented in its definitive, top-range sake: <i>Saykoh </i>(青煌). Sake made in this manner have a characteristic freshness and crispness that is all but impossible to imitate.The Master Brewer of the Takenoi Brewery is Shimizu Koichiro (清水紘一郎).</p><p>He has literally dedicated his entire life to sake, having been born and raised in Takenoi, and working in it now. He studied sake brewing at the Tokyo University of Agriculture, and spent 3 years working in other breweries before returning to Takenoi. Saykoh is his brainchild, and he is deservedly proud of it.The brewery produces approximately 90,000 liters of sake annually.</p></div>","* All bottles in this campaign are 720 ml Sakura by Haru bottles.

Did you know that between 2010-2019, one in five Japanese sake breweries disappeared.
Not because their sake was bad. Many of these have history dating back centuries, back to when Japan was a feudal society.
But why then? After all, don’t they sell for a pretty good price, especially outside of Japan?
As sake lovers - we did our research. And the number one answer was …
“We can’t earn”
F&B outlets pressure middlemen, middlemen pressure each other and the last middlemen pressure the breweries. 99.6% of breweries are SMEs which can produce the best sake in the world, but don’t have much bargaining power.
In fact, the more meticulous the brewery, the better the sake. But subsequently, the smaller the production amount and the brewery has an even harder time resisting pressure to slash prices.
Right now, you’re going to see an inflated price tag anyway. That amount you’re paying? Out of that on the average bottle the brewery may get a few dollars. For brewing an alcohol that is probably the most labor intensive in the world and which demands exceeding meticulousness.
There must be a better way
Many of the breweries are soldiering on out of love for the craft but we think that they should earn.
They must for sake to live on.
This is why we, a team of Sake lovers, are working with the Takenoi brewery (武の井酒造), to create a custom line of sake brewed for the Singaporean taste.
No middlemen, delivered straight to you without a restaurant gouging you. Obama brewery is also getting a far more reasonable price for their work and profit sharing.
This sake isn't coming at an unreasonable price either. More details below but this is an ultra-premium brew at a very reasonable price in Singapore.

About the Sake
The quality of a sake is determined heavily by the quality of the rice and water used in making it and the mastery of the artisans involved.
Ingredients
Careful choice has been placed in all elements of the sake. In particular:

The water is from an underground river under the Yatsugatake mountain range (八ヶ岳山麓). This water source is certified as one of the top 100 water sources in Japan (名水百選) 
The rice used will be the Special Grade (特等) Yamada-nishiki (山田錦)
The yeast used is derived from the Sakura flower.
As an added bonus gold leaf reminiscent of floating sakura petals will be added to the alcohol.

Artistry


Takenoi is one of the only 30 breweries among the 1400 which are able to use flower-based yeasts in their fermentation.
The brewmaster himself aside from being the 6th generation in a long line of sake-brewers also studied sake-brewing academically in his university times.
Our sake is classified as a Junmai Daiginjo (純米大吟醸), which is generally considered to be the top grade of sake available with well less than 2% of all sake falling into this category.
Our sake has an extremely high polish rate of 29%, where 71% of the rice grain is milled away, leaving only the purest core which is responsible for producing superior aroma and taste.


What We Need & What You Get
Your contributions (thank you!) will be going to the process of bringing the alcohol to Singapore including:

The costs of producing the alcohol
Costs for preparing the necessary food safety documentation etc.
Shipping the alcohol to Singapore
Alcohol taxes in Singapore
Storage and other logistics in Singapore

In return, we will bring to you directly the number of bottles you ordered and other rewards depending on how much you have contributed. The per bottle price that you are contributing here will be lower than how much it goes to retail for.
Don't forget that this sake makes for a good present, and can be used for corporate events too!
Delivery
We expect to make the sake available by April 2021. Due to Indiegogo rules, we are committing to physically delivering the sake to you. Alternatively, you can also pick it up from us.

The Impact
Success with Takenoi will give us an example to approach more breweries in Japan, and bring more commissioned hidden sake gems to Singapore.
Many of these traditional breweries are facing an uphill battle to survive. First, they are unable to compete with larger breweries that have decided to focus on quantity, and profit margins. Second, in many cases, they lack market volume as they do not have the ability to bring their sake overseas without assistance. Due to this, traditional sake brewing is a dying craft in Japan, with many traditional techniques responsible for producing superior sake on the verge of being lost.
By making this project a success, we want to show that there are people (like you and us) in the world who do appreciate good sake. By doing so, we will prove that in this day and age, tradition remains important, and that the craft that goes into making sake should be preserved.
Sake brewing is a craft that deserves to be passed down, and we hope to play our part in this.

Risks & Challenges
As of now, production is on track but unexpected events (such as a typhoon) can disrupt production.
The situation with COVID-19 may cause issues, although shipping between Japan and Singapore remains stable, and on schedule.
In the case of disruption from any of the above events, we will inform backers of any changes in batch size or delays. If necessary, we will issue the appropriate refunds.

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you're not sure whether you can immediately contribute, you can help us still!

Sharing through social media, especially with your friends who enjoy sake;
Subscribing to our mailing list for more updates and news

will help us!
If you are an F&B outlet who wants to know more, feel free to contact us at  contact@harusake.com too.
Anyway, we wish to thank all of our supporters in advance! As it customary in Japan when drinking, let us wish everyone a very happy KAMPAI (乾杯)!
About Obama ShuzoThe Takenoi Brewery was established in 1865. It is located in Hokuto City, in Yamanashi Prefecture.As of present, six generations of the founding family have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of the perfection of their craft. The staff at the Takenoi Brewery feels great satisfaction at being able to work in conjunction with nature to bring smiles to those who drink the sake they go to painstaking extents to perfect.The Takenoi Brewery is notable for being one of 30 breweries, out of more than 1400 breweries in Japan, to be approved to use yeast derived from roses in the production of its sake. It is set further apart from the competition by being the only brewery that uses rose-derived yeast sake of the junmai daiginjo class.This is represented in its definitive, top-range sake: Saykoh (青煌). Sake made in this manner have a characteristic freshness and crispness that is all but impossible to imitate.The Master Brewer of the Takenoi Brewery is Shimizu Koichiro (清水紘一郎).He has literally dedicated his entire life to sake, having been born and raised in Takenoi, and working in it now. He studied sake brewing at the Tokyo University of Agriculture, and spent 3 years working in other breweries before returning to Takenoi. Saykoh is his brainchild, and he is deservedly proud of it.The brewery produces approximately 90,000 liters of sake annually.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hello my name is Denis Gekara and I am the entrepreneur behind Wild Kenyan Hot Sauce. After graduating from Fairmont State University with my general degree in business it was a challenge to get a job, so I opened a small restaurant in Morgantown West Virginia, and named it the Kenyan Cafe. The purpose was to pay my bills but it grew to a full restaurant. I had minimal experience in managing, so I had to learn on the job. I made a lot of mistakes in six years only grossing around $315k. Shortly after opening, I needed a hot sauce to fit my style of cooking. I wanted to be able to bake with it, for customers to use on the table, and toss my wings in it to serve my customers. I couldn’t find any so I found the materials and made my own! Wild Kenyan hot sauce was born! My customers loved it. I got endless requests from customers who wanted to buy it.</p></li>
<li><p>I am at the stage where I need to expand and this campaign is a way to propel me forward toward nationally distributing my hot sauce to share it with everyone. I am in Whole Foods Mid Atlantic company with many other small stores in the region. I am an UNFI  national distributor and with their help I am ready to drop my hot anywhere and it will be purchased  across the country. At this level of expansion it can be costly and in need lots of inventory at the start. </p></li>
<li><p>With your support it will be possible to sell my hot sauce in major grocery stores nationwide. I also have big dream of expanding internationally.  I promise your contribution will make a big difference to me and please talk it over with your friends and co workers and be a part of the big crowd of my wonderful customers even if you don't usually use hot sauces.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $75,000 to fully fund my initial demand, right now I am mostly doing 10 oz but I have come to appreciate what 5 oz play in introducing my hot lots of homes. Usually my customer who has not tried my hot sauce before buying they first buy 5 oz and later they buy two 10 oz bottles or more. I have lots of repeat customer who explained to me that; the reason why they use my hot is because baught 5 oz first.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will share my hot with you and am sure you will share it with your friends too. It makes a good gift for your family or co worker. Prepare a special meal and share with your family and friends. If you have a restaurant,  gallon size will be ideal,  try it with your wings and see it the customers will bite! In my perks, In will include 64 oz and six 5 oz  or  10 oz  and 3  bottles 10 oz, twelve 5 oz or 10 oz, eight 5 oz , and four of the 5 oz or 10 oz. Please check our perk section.</li>
<li>So of the $ 75,000 I will make I have enough inventory of 10 oz to all whole foods in the country with cost of $32,000 and $ 15,000 will go 5 oz, $13,000 for gallon sizes 10 half gallon sizes $ 5,000 transport cost. Your contribution will give us a good start to reach that goal. I will update your how we are doing. Thank you so much for doing this for me! I sincerely appreciate.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I hope by the 2nd quarter 2019 I will have started to import papers directly from my village where I grew up. I just want to give education and hope to children who end up being doctors and teachers. I hope to be of help as much as I can. My goal is  to complete a library in my local High School should I be privileged to get this project off the ground.</p>
<p>I started Kenyan Cafe with $ 6,672 and build it to $ 335, 000 annually for 6 years. I can do this! Your contribution will pave the way to getting more customers and wider distribution of the Wild Kenyan Hot Sauce. </p>
<p>I believe someone has to do something different and that person is me, my hot sauce is different and my goal is to change the way people use hot sauce. I would like to use this opportunity to grow and help even more people than we do now. I believe this can be a 10, 20 million dollar company supporting multiple families. With unlimited opportunity to lift others!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If you cannot get a good start as you expand, you will always struggle with cash flow which is vital to expand and allowing all regions to access this amazing product.</p></li>
<li>
<p>I have had challenges but I did not quit and now it is not quitting time. I always believe that good things are not easy. Challenges were part of my story  growing up in Kenyan. I think an obstacle means you have do things differently and not quit! If I quit then I have failed to solve a problem. I faced a problem when I could not find the hot sauce which can be used in multiple ways.</p>
<p>I have knocked on doors and I continue to knock on doors until this is a national brand. When you have a good product customer will always support you and I am encouraged by my Wild Kenyan Hot Sauce!! We have quite a fun base...Love you all!!</p>

<h2>Who and What is Sawbriar Brewery? </h2>
<p>Hi folks, my name is John Paul, and with my awesome wife, Jessica, we are opening the first Louisiana state-licensed microbrewery in the heart of Cajun Country. We need your help by backing this project to make it a success. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530737770/g8yyqzoemyuujrjplpzm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is our 2nd attempt at our crowdfund (this time on Indiegogo), with a lower goal, shorter timeline, and better rewards so those that supported us before get the chance to see this happen!</p>
<p>Sawbriar Brewery will be a friendly neighborhood microbrewery and taproom in downtown Lafayette, Louisiana, where we responsibly brew better beer from unique ingredients while celebrating local art and music.</p>
<h3>Why Sawbriar?</h3>
<p>The name “Sawbriar” reflects our Louisiana roots. The sawbriar is a native plant common around the swampy woods of South Louisiana. They are deeply rooted in the Louisiana soil, tough and stubborn - kind of like us. Despite the thorny exterior, the sawbriar plants are a vital part of their ecosystem, providing food to the native wildlife and, historically, used to soothe the ailments of the local peoples. Like the sawbriar, we want our brewery to be a vital part of the community (and beer has been known to cure what ALES you!)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530737871/do9sfvtl7t6hft5nj1hc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to brew better beer for a better world. We make great beer while focusing on using responsible techniques and local ingredients.  </p>
<p>With <i>your</i> help, our taproom will be your place away from home and work where you can interact with neighbors, make memories, live life, and have fun.</p>
<h3>Sawbriar Beer</h3>
<p><i>What kind of beer do we make? We make better beer because you deserve better.​</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530737943/tt17dknhuk9kp5osycl1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The advantages of having a taproom where everything made is small batch and nothing distributed are flexibility, spontaneity and craft. We make a large variety of lagers, ales, stouts, porters, and sours. Some are classically inspired and others way out in left hop field. All of our beer uses the freshest local ingredients we can find. There will also be a constant rotation of seasonal surprises. (What can we say, we like to experiment!) </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530737974/dxbavjewibgujtcixxm1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Some of the many brews you might encounter on our taps include:   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Love Bug Lager</strong>: 5.4% ABV, 29 IBU, 2.4 SRM · Perfect summer time brew for the hot and humid days of South Louisiana. Cold, clear and crisp, this lager is influenced by the pre-prohibition recipes of Old West settlers. Great for cooling down after cleaning the bugs off the windshield.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cypress Stout</strong>: 6% ABV, 15 IBU, 50 SRM · A different take on Irish Extra Stout brewed with local coffee. Cypress stout pours thick and creamy but goes down smoothly with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee and oak. Perfect as desert at the end of a meal or a warmup on a cold day.</li>
<li>
<strong>Crawnado Amber Ale</strong>: 4.5% ABV, 22 IBU, 8 SRM · Easy drinking amber ale made with Louisiana wheat and sugarcane that makes the perfect all-occasion pint. Great with crawfish, crab boils and hurricane parties.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Mad Monkey IPA</strong>: 10% ABV. 90 IBU, 9 SRM · A creation of momentary madness and an aggressive hop schedule, this IPA uses seven different hops from all over the world. It is an exploration of the dark and hazy, juicy and spice. Far from a bitter hop bomb, Mad Monkey is a balanced explosion of flavors and aromas that will drive the sense from the senses.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fightin'ville Brow Ale</strong>: 5.7% ABV, 43 IBU, 27 SRM · Slightly sweet, American take on English brown pub ale, made with English and specialty malts, and US hops. Great to quench the thirst with lunch or sipping with friends in the taproom after work. Named in remembrance of the neighborhood surrounding Sawbriar Brewery.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Plan </h3>
<p>Sawbriar Brewery will open in late 2018 - this video talks about our first campaign on Kickstarter which didn't make it, but the project is the same concpet. Before we get there, we need your help to finish some things, like the taproom:</p>
<div></div>
<ul><li>Next comes the equipment. We have planned for a 7-barrel, steam-fired brewhouse and plenty of fermenters and brite tanks to provide plenty of choices of the freshest beer. </li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530738182/kfx3wzdpkngvp2pzgnqu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a stage dedicated to hosting local musicians, because we know you like to dance! </li>
<li>With a local community partner we are fixing up a derelict warehouse that currently blights the otherwise awesome historic neighborhood of LaPlace, also known as Fightin’ville. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Still it seems like I forgot something else we needed…</i></p>

<h3>Milestones </h3>
<p>We've done a lot so far!</p>
<ul>
<li>Licensing and permitting is on schedule for opening in late 2018.</li>
<li>Our starting recipes are fully developed, and even won a few awards!</li>
<li>We have a lease for our building and construction has started. </li>
<li>Some of our equipment is already here, and more is ready to ship. </li>
<li>The final plans are complete, and we just need your backing to finish up. </li>
<li>Right now, we estimate it will take over $200,000 to finish the work on the building. We are asking $10,000 of your support as seed money to get enough of the remaining work done to open.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530738335/xtvlnfcr77ijbumlvwsm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Cool Swag for Your Support </h3>
<p>We mentioned before that this is a relaunched effort on Indiegogo after our first one only made it halfway on Kickstarter. So we dropped our goal, made pledge levels more affordable, and added more stuff to each level!</p>
<p>Need the softest beer shirt ever made (in Lafayette, no less)? Like seeing your name in awesome places? We have some awesome rewards to match every budget, because everyone deserves better beer!</p>

<h3>You Deserve Better</h3>
<p>We are asking for your help on Kickstarter because we know you deserve better. Without it, we would have to cut some corners, and that does not make for better beer. Our <strong>$10,000 project goal</strong> is much less than we have put in personally, and doesn’t cover all that’s left, but it does get the doors open. We've worked hard to get this far; we are 100% local and self-funded – no help from the big beer monopolies (ever) - just a happily married couple of beer nerds trying to live out our dreams.</p>
<p><strong>What makes us different? Nothing.</strong> We are probably just like you, working hard as we can every day to make things better where we can. Jessica and John are your average folks –two parents: a teacher and an Army vet. But <strong>Lafayette is the best city</strong> in the best state in the world. We just want to make better beer for you. Because you deserve better.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>With all great ventures there is risk. Here’s what could go wrong &amp; what we can do about it.</p>

</div></div>","Who and What is Sawbriar Brewery? 
Hi folks, my name is John Paul, and with my awesome wife, Jessica, we are opening the first Louisiana state-licensed microbrewery in the heart of Cajun Country. We need your help by backing this project to make it a success. 

This is our 2nd attempt at our crowdfund (this time on Indiegogo), with a lower goal, shorter timeline, and better rewards so those that supported us before get the chance to see this happen!
Sawbriar Brewery will be a friendly neighborhood microbrewery and taproom in downtown Lafayette, Louisiana, where we responsibly brew better beer from unique ingredients while celebrating local art and music.
Why Sawbriar?
The name “Sawbriar” reflects our Louisiana roots. The sawbriar is a native plant common around the swampy woods of South Louisiana. They are deeply rooted in the Louisiana soil, tough and stubborn - kind of like us. Despite the thorny exterior, the sawbriar plants are a vital part of their ecosystem, providing food to the native wildlife and, historically, used to soothe the ailments of the local peoples. Like the sawbriar, we want our brewery to be a vital part of the community (and beer has been known to cure what ALES you!)

Our mission is to brew better beer for a better world. We make great beer while focusing on using responsible techniques and local ingredients.  
With your help, our taproom will be your place away from home and work where you can interact with neighbors, make memories, live life, and have fun.
Sawbriar Beer
What kind of beer do we make? We make better beer because you deserve better.​

The advantages of having a taproom where everything made is small batch and nothing distributed are flexibility, spontaneity and craft. We make a large variety of lagers, ales, stouts, porters, and sours. Some are classically inspired and others way out in left hop field. All of our beer uses the freshest local ingredients we can find. There will also be a constant rotation of seasonal surprises. (What can we say, we like to experiment!) 

Some of the many brews you might encounter on our taps include:   


Love Bug Lager: 5.4% ABV, 29 IBU, 2.4 SRM · Perfect summer time brew for the hot and humid days of South Louisiana. Cold, clear and crisp, this lager is influenced by the pre-prohibition recipes of Old West settlers. Great for cooling down after cleaning the bugs off the windshield.

Cypress Stout: 6% ABV, 15 IBU, 50 SRM · A different take on Irish Extra Stout brewed with local coffee. Cypress stout pours thick and creamy but goes down smoothly with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee and oak. Perfect as desert at the end of a meal or a warmup on a cold day.

Crawnado Amber Ale: 4.5% ABV, 22 IBU, 8 SRM · Easy drinking amber ale made with Louisiana wheat and sugarcane that makes the perfect all-occasion pint. Great with crawfish, crab boils and hurricane parties.  

Mad Monkey IPA: 10% ABV. 90 IBU, 9 SRM · A creation of momentary madness and an aggressive hop schedule, this IPA uses seven different hops from all over the world. It is an exploration of the dark and hazy, juicy and spice. Far from a bitter hop bomb, Mad Monkey is a balanced explosion of flavors and aromas that will drive the sense from the senses.

Fightin'ville Brow Ale: 5.7% ABV, 43 IBU, 27 SRM · Slightly sweet, American take on English brown pub ale, made with English and specialty malts, and US hops. Great to quench the thirst with lunch or sipping with friends in the taproom after work. Named in remembrance of the neighborhood surrounding Sawbriar Brewery.  

The Plan 
Sawbriar Brewery will open in late 2018 - this video talks about our first campaign on Kickstarter which didn't make it, but the project is the same concpet. Before we get there, we need your help to finish some things, like the taproom:

Next comes the equipment. We have planned for a 7-barrel, steam-fired brewhouse and plenty of fermenters and brite tanks to provide plenty of choices of the freshest beer. 


There is a stage dedicated to hosting local musicians, because we know you like to dance! 
With a local community partner we are fixing up a derelict warehouse that currently blights the otherwise awesome historic neighborhood of LaPlace, also known as Fightin’ville. 

Still it seems like I forgot something else we needed…

Milestones 
We've done a lot so far!

Licensing and permitting is on schedule for opening in late 2018.
Our starting recipes are fully developed, and even won a few awards!
We have a lease for our building and construction has started. 
Some of our equipment is already here, and more is ready to ship. 
The final plans are complete, and we just need your backing to finish up. 
Right now, we estimate it will take over $200,000 to finish the work on the building. We are asking $10,000 of your support as seed money to get enough of the remaining work done to open.


Cool Swag for Your Support 
We mentioned before that this is a relaunched effort on Indiegogo after our first one only made it halfway on Kickstarter. So we dropped our goal, made pledge levels more affordable, and added more stuff to each level!
Need the softest beer shirt ever made (in Lafayette, no less)? Like seeing your name in awesome places? We have some awesome rewards to match every budget, because everyone deserves better beer!


You Deserve Better
We are asking for your help on Kickstarter because we know you deserve better. Without it, we would have to cut some corners, and that does not make for better beer. Our $10,000 project goal is much less than we have put in personally, and doesn’t cover all that’s left, but it does get the doors open. We've worked hard to get this far; we are 100% local and self-funded – no help from the big beer monopolies (ever) - just a happily married couple of beer nerds trying to live out our dreams.
What makes us different? Nothing. We are probably just like you, working hard as we can every day to make things better where we can. Jessica and John are your average folks –two parents: a teacher and an Army vet. But Lafayette is the best city in the best state in the world. We just want to make better beer for you. Because you deserve better.

Risks and Challenges
With all great ventures there is risk. Here’s what could go wrong & what we can do about it.


You may not like our beer. That’s OK! Like Louisiana weather, our beer is constantly changing. Unlike Louisiana weather, it will change. We use our taproom customer feedback to constantly improve our recipes.

We could run out of money and be personally ruined.  A harsh reality indeed, but with your help and our solid plan, we are sure to make it!
 The laws may change and prohibition return.  We certainly see crazy things in politics lately, but regular voting will keep this from happening. That's also why Sawbriar Brewery is a member of the Louisiana Craft Brewers Guild.

Our schedule may slip. Late 2018 is an estimate subject to final approvals, contractor performance, and a little luck. Brewer John happens to also be an accomplished project manager, so we are pretty good at adjusting to changes and meeting the goal.

Meteors, evil robots, alien takeovers and zombies.  Acts of God are unavoidable, but I guarantee we are praying daily for a favorable outcome. We wouldn’t mind you sending a few prayers our way too. And a map to your bunker. (We promise our beer won’t make you a zombie.)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a small Detroit-based, vegan, fast-casual startup restaurant. We will be serving plant-based versions of classic diner food such as burgers, fries, hot dogs, and sandwiches.</p>
<p>We are currently seeking an investment of $15,000 which would cover our initial investment costs. These costs include inventory costs, property acquisition and renovations, ServSafe certification, and our Health Department costs and other government agencies fees. My brother-in-law who owns his own commercial and residential construction business will be doing the renovations. He and his wife will also help with the day-to-day operations of the restaurant.</p>
<p>My name is Dustin Vanderburg. I am the Co-Owner and Head Chef here at Vegan in the Hood LLC. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a Major in Hospitality Management. My expected graduation is August 28, 2020. I currently work as a Shift Supervisor Rx for CVS. I also have experience with management at BabiesRUs and ToysRUs. All 3 positions allowed me to manage in a team setting. I have 15 years of retail experience and about 2 years of warehouse experience. I also have an Associate's degree in General Business and an Associate's degree in Multimedia and two certificates in Small Business Management and Entrepreneurship, and Supervision.</p>
<p>My wife, Angela Vanderburg is the other Co-Owner. She has kitchen experience with a local community organization and also has retail experience.</p>
<p>Our current demographic is approximately 2% of Detroiters who are vegan and vegetarian and the unknown percentage of flexitarians and pescatarians here in Detroit. The aforementioned 2% of Detroiters are roughly equivalent to 106,300 people. We hope to reach many of these people with social media and marketing. We are already making a name for the restaurant and have already had calls regarding orders. We are trying to get this project off the ground so we can fulfill future orders that come in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently seeking an investment of $15,000 which would cover our initial investment costs. These costs include inventory costs, property acquisition and renovations, ServSafe certification, and our Health Department costs and other government agencies fees.</p>
<p>At the $5 Level, you will get a handwritten thank you note from myself and my wife, collectively the co-owners. This will ship out on or around August 2020.</p>
<p>At the $25 Level, you will get a dish with your name on it. This is a limited prize due to our limited menu of course.</p>
<p>At the $100 Level, you will get an invitation to the Soft opening private food tasting. This prize is limited due to the cost and available space. If we can raise much more than the goal we can offer more of this prize level depending on the number of contributions.</p>
<p>At the $2500 Level, we are offering a Chef's Table after-hours private tasting of my favorite dishes in a 3-course meal setting.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we can reach our goal this will offer a healthy comfort food option to the food desert that is Downtown Detroit. Our mission is to bring a healthy alternative to the fast-food garbage that is served locally. We want to offer comfort food that we and the people around here locally grew up with but in a vegan format. This will also give vegans in the area some of the options they are missing or crave. Detroit is a hotbed for vegan food and we want to offer an alternative to the million and one non-vegan diners and Coney Islands around this area.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is the timeline for the Health Department certification and inspection. Once we tackle that hurdle it is mostly smooth sailing for the most part up until opening. Getting the building we want for a good price and getting the renovation done quickly and cost-effectively is the other major challenge facing us. The Health Department is a necessary evil that we must face and there is not much we can do to remedy that, however, getting funding for this project will help get the building and get the process started. Another major hurdle is advertising. We have already started to make a name for ourselves and have orders coming in even before we are open. This is great but to maintain customers we need a building and to advertise. We have already started on this process thanks to social media. We plan to increase this by reaching out to local news stations and radio personalities once we get closer to open to spread the word even further. We hope to catch the eye of the public like some of our competition. Of course, we also plan to utilize traditional advertising methods as well to increase public awareness of our location. We have selected a high traffic area in which to operate as well.</p>

Sealing zipper lock bags will never be easier!! ZipSealer® is going to be your new favorite kitchen tool once you get your hands on one!
(International Patents Pending)
Many people find sealing any kind of zipper locking bag to be difficult and frustrating, including some seniors or people with chronic hand or finger joint pain like Arthritis. You never really know if the seal is completely tight from end to end. Some people even lie the bag down flat on the counter and and use it to push down on when sliding their finger along the zipper. This doesn't really work so well if the bag is bulky and full or has liquid or powder in it. The ZipSealer® makes it incredibly easy to get the tightest seal possible every single time, you will love using it!

Remember... Perks are priced in Canadian Dollars. Any Contribution Made in US Dollars will effectively have a 20% - 25% Discount at Current Exchange Rates!!

""Growing up and later living on and running the family farm taught me a lot about being resourceful and making the most of what you have at hand. If there was ever a problem that needed solving, or something broke down, spending a lot of time and money to have someone else take care of it was rarely an option. You had to be creative to get by and use what you had available to make it work. Usually that meant keeping the solution as simple as possible.... That philosophy is reflected in the simplicity of the ZipSealer®. It's so easy to use and it works GREAT!""
 
1. Hold the bag and pinch one end of the zipper to start.

2. Place the zipper between the ZipSealer® tong ends in the ""ZipZone""(between chevrons  >>>|<<<).

3. Gently squeeze the ZipSealer® and slide along keeping the zipper in ""ZipZone"".

The ZipSealer® was designed and will be manufactured locally by some very talented and experienced people. Keeping things close to home has helped to ensure the highest quality production and a smooth road from concept to marketplace. We have tried to minimize any long distance problems associated when dealing with entities overseas simply for the sake of reducing costs... and usually at the expense of quality. No compromises were made to ensure that the highest standards of design, manufacturing and function were always maintained in creating the ZipSealer®.

<p>While Dionne's success as a small business-owner has followed her through her founding of The Teahouse restaurant in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as well as her wildly popular first location of Revolution Bakery, today we need <strong>your</strong> support to help Dionne dream even bigger.</p>
<p>With your donations, Dionne can open up her second location of Revolution Bakery, coming to Albuquerque, New Mexico. During the especially challenging times of Covid-19, your contribution will directly support both a small-business owner and the community she serves, one loaf at a time. <br/> </p>

<h3>10,000 Pounds</h3>
<p>While mass-produced gluten-free breads often use a starch base such as corn starch, potato starch or tapioca, Revolution Bakery uses ancient grains that are heartier, healthier and much more delicious. Your donations will help Dionne to purchase all the necessary bases she uses to bake 100% gluten free, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buckwheat</li>
<li>Millet</li>
<li>Quinoa</li>
<li>Sorghum</li>
<li>Gluten-free oats</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to 10,000 pounds of flour, donations will also go toward securing all the equipment necessary for a fully functioning kitchen in the new bakery, including ovens, mixers, refrigeration, tables and racks. </p>

<p>Through grassroots fundraising, Revolution Bakery will give directly back to the New Mexico community by donating 10% of all proceeds made from this campaign to Pete's Place.

<p>Tyler and I have been friends since we were little tots. So good a friend, I risked being fired from Nobu for asking Geddy Lee (Rush) his autograph for Ty, which he obliged. ""Chef - Keep on cookin,"" is what he wrote. I think the world of him as a friend and even more as a chef.</p>
<p>The single most important ingredient to the success of any restaurant is the food, which is why I am certain that we will thrive. Pizzas, sandwiches, salads, juices, smoothies, boozey kegged lemonades, beer and wine served quickly for either dine in or to go.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise 100K to get Nova Lua up and running. The more the merrier! Your contributions will go to everything from designing the restaurant, to development of the menu, and everything in between. Pick out multiple perks if you please. No contribution is too large or too small. We appreciate any amount that you can contribute.</p>
<p>Our list of perks were designed, as best we could, to bring you into a place that you have helped to create and to show you how incredible plant based food can be so that you will become regulars. We want to see your faces. We want you to feel like you have helped create something positive for the community. We want to show our appreciation for your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our intention is to grow Nova Lua to multiple locations. It starts with the first one. If we are gonna to change the world, we're gonna need all the help we can get.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Nobody in the restaurant business has been untouched by Covid. My heart goes out to the hundreds of friends I have worked with over the years and to many more that have lost their jobs and even their restaurants. I do, however believe that in this upheaval a new business model will emerge and I know Nova Lua will be wildly successful. </p>
<p>As the cost of meat and seafood continue to skyrocket, the cost of vegetables remains reasonable. Our relationships with local farmers allows us to cut cost. The closer the farmer, the better the quality of food and lower carbon footprint.</p>

<h3>The Long and the Short of It</h3>
<p>Erica and I ordinarily work as tour guides in the Cinque Terre, particularly with English-speaking clients, especially Americans, but with the Covid travel restrictions we found ourselves basically without a job this year.  But we had a Plan B in our pockets: wine!  We work very closely with winemakers in the Cinque Terre, and Erica is a sommelier-in-training.  Most importantly, we purchased an abandoned vineyard years ago, always hoping that we would have time to transform it.  Well, in this sense, we have to say thank you Coronavirus, because we had nothing but time this year.</p>
<p>In May we started clearing the land, just Erica and me,  Everyone in town, and we mean everyone, thought we were nuts.  The video gives a bit of an idea of how it was: the battle with the thorns, rusty wire (about 3 cubic meters total), and 20 foot pine trees was pretty intense, and the steepness of the hillside was daunting.  So was the heat.  But it's November now, we still have all of our fingers, and the land we need for planting (half an acre for starts) is clear.  They think we're a little less nuts now.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.  We've done everything ourselves up until now, but we need a Bobcat (and a Bobcat driver) to  create a yard-wide path from bottom to top (140 meters!), pull up the roots of everything we cut down, and do the heavy digging needed to start replacing the stone terraces that this region is famous for.</p>
<p>Our short term plan after the Bobcat excavation is to build a fence (for the rampant and pesky wild boars), and planting the grape vines (all 1500 of them!) in Fall 2021.  Our long term goal is to eventually purchase the equipment for a wine cellar so as to be ready for our first vintage in 2025, a necessary time frame since grape vines need on average 4 years between planting and their first usable harvest,  In the meantime, we will be working with local winemaker friends in the fields and in the cellars during the harvests, to get as much practice as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>12,000 dollars would get us a long way through this second phase of our project.  Getting someone and their Bobcat on our field is not going to be cheap, and rightly so: they deserve whatever they are asking for to work on a hillside that looks like a Black Diamond ski slope!  Even if we don't get to our goal, anything that we are able to raise will go toward that budget.  If we pass our goal, the extra money will go into the fences and grape vine seedlings that we mentioned above.</p>
<p>Naturally, we would love to be able to pay you back for your generosity with our own wine, but we think it's asking a lot of you to wait five years for a bottle, no matter how good it is.  So we're offering to reward your faith in our dream by the means we have: free tours in the Cinque Terre for anyone who can get here (there will be a post-Covid era sometime), online wine tasting experiences for those who can't, plus some personal recipes and wine tips for everyone else.  Our exchanges will thus be on an entirely personal level; we hope to meet you in person or online, but no matter what, we will be able t o pass along a bit of ourselves, our passion, and our knowledge about Italy to you. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>In case you didn't know, every inch of this coastal area of Italy was once farmed, almost entirely with grapes and olives.  Today, as any of you who has had to good luck to see the Cinque Terre in person, that is no longer so.  And so while you would be helping us personally to rebuild this particular vineyard, in a small way you would be helping to reclaim a bit of the old agricultural traditions and culture.  After all, this area is a UNESCO world heritage site because of its history of terraced farming, not for mass tourism!</p>
<p>Write to us if you have any questions, we'd love to build a real relationship with our potential backers.  Pass the word along to any friends or family who love Italy, the Cinque Terre, or just plain old wine.  And grazie, grazie, grazie!</p>

Hop Merchants will be the first store of its kind in the San Fernando Valley. We're essentially a hybrid beer bar/store with 16 rotating taps and 300 individual bottles that you'll be able to purchase and drink at the shop or take home with you.  We don't serve food but you can bring your own, or even have it delivered.  Heck, we'll even supply the menus and recommendations. We want to support local businesses and hope that, in turn, they will support us.</p><h3>ABOUT THE OWNERS</h3><p>The team is led by Christian Thomas, Kevin Sack, and Adrian Baez...three guys who started homebrewing their own beer in Christian's garage while dreaming about someday opening their own place to call beervana.

<p><i>“I am a huge fan of TruEnergy; the shot gives me an extra burst of energy when I need it, and I am able to enjoy it without THE crash that I’ve experienced with other similar products! Thank you TruEnergy for making my day. ”</i>​</p>
<p><strong>McKenzie Meehan (Sky Blue FC, NWSL)</strong></p>
<p><i>“As a professional soccer player, I really enjoy taking TruEnergy. It’s a great product both in season and off-season, as it can provide a great boost of energy prior to an early morning workout or it can be a great energizer between two tough sessions. I would recommend any athlete, whether recreational or elite, to give this product a try.”</i></p>
<p><strong>James Fahey (Atlanta Blaze, MLL)​</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>​</strong>“As a pro lacrosse player we don’t have team workouts or team practices in the off season. It’s our responsibility to create a efficient dietary plan, fitness and skill training regiment as well as balancing a full time job. After being on my feet all day at work, I shoot back a TruEnergy and it enables me to put in the solid hours in the gym I need to prepare for the upcoming season.”</i></p>
<p><strong>Emily Harman (Ex-Pro Tennis Player / Division 1 Coach)</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>​</strong>“As a former professional tennis player and now a division 1 coach, I have learned the hard way what it means to balance energy levels with peak cognitive performance. TruEnergy has been an innovative and natural solution to stay focused mentally while maintaining physical energy throughout all aspects of professional training and student-athlete life.</i></p>
<p><strong>Aaron Fossas (Cincinatti Reds, MLB Prospect)</strong></p>
<p><i>“Absolutely loving ‘TruEnergy’ for providing me the energy and fuel needed to prepare for Spring Training. For anyone who passionately pursues their dreams check out @_jackmcnamara for some inspiration and to see what he has to help you take what you do to the next level ”</i>​</p>
<p><strong>Lenny Futterman (Rower, USA Senior National Team)</strong></p>
<p><i>“As an elite athlete, I am constantly searching for the best products to power my workouts. After years of using different pre-workout mixes that would either give me a huge jolt and crash, or just leave me feeling sick by the end of a workout, I finally came upon TruEnergy. It is loaded with all natural ingredients that make your body preform better. I find that it dials me in to the task at hand without the painful side effects of other products.”</i></p>
<p><strong>Richie Dart (Triathlete)</strong></p>
<p><i>“I used to force a coffee down in the morning and then get on the bike to ride for a few hours, now I drink Tru in the morning and I don’t deal with the stomach issues from coffee when I am in the aero position on the bike and I am getting even better results! Tru is a staple in my training for Ironman and will be with me on the course, especially during the second half of the marathon!”</i></p>
<p><strong>Ben Eaves (Director of Human Performance, Miami RedHawks)</strong></p>
<p><i>“I use and highly recommend TruEnergy to all the athletes I train. Whether it is before a practice, workout or a midday boost, TruEnergy delivers a great tasting drink that enhances performance.”</i></p>

TruEnergy - The Healthy Energy Drink
Ever tempted fate by guzzling down too many energy drinks leading to heart palpitations?Here's a thought. Your every day branded energy drinks are just sugar laden sodas with caffeine. Tired of the ""monster"" in the room, our team formulated a good-for-you alternative infused with natural ingredients that tasted great while also delivering on the promise of a long lasting smooth boost of clean energy. 
 

TruFocus - The Office Hero Beverage
Ever want to knock your boss straight in the jibs for publicly humiliating due to your lack of focus? With this cutting-edge beverage, gone will be the days of having to reach for those illegal ""limitless pills"" stored secretly deep in your desk. Developed with highly functional herbal ingredients and paired with a 2:1 nootropic stack, TruFocus will help increase mental acuity and improve overall focus so that you can take that jerks job.
 

TruPower - The Powderless Pre Workout 
Ever forced down a chalky pre workout mix with a cheese curd texture that tasted like old fermented milk? We have and we refuse to do it again. Designed by athletes for athletes, this sport shot delivers a serious boost of power. Amped up with 2x natural caffeine and fortified with BCAA and Beta Alanine, we guarantee that TruPower Pre Workout will quickly become your favorite spotter at the gym.
 

TruRally - The Antihangover Lemon Aid
Ever tempted fate by guzzling down too many energy drinks leading to heart palpitations?Here's a thought. Your every day branded energy drinks are just sugar laden sodas with caffeine. Tired of the ""monster"" in the room, our team formulated a good-for-you alternative infused with natural ingredients that tasted great while also delivering on the promise of a long lasting smooth boost of clean energy. 
 

TruSleep - The Sleep Support Shot
Ever reached into the cupboard for some of grandpa's good ole' cough syrup for a good night sleep? Here's the deal. The market and its fancy commercials riddled with side effects and smiling faces wants you to believe that the only solution to zzz's is over the counter drugs; however, it is a dangerous and false lesson. Maybe counting sheep is a loss cause, but natural alternatives like Melatonin when paired appropriately can result in some very sweet dreams. 
 

Why Trust the Man in the Speedo
While playing pro hockey in Europe, Jack ""the speedo flaunting founder"" McNamara took his first steps into entrepreneurship participating in one of Denmark’s top student incubators, Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship. After hanging up the skates, he moved to NYC with one of his business partners, Robert Avakian, where they participated in the accelerators; Startup 52 and Food-X. 
Despite surfing couches, crashing offices and even living in a gym, the team has successfully funded a Kickstarter, added strategic brick and mortars including Market Basket and HyVee, online stores like Amazon and Jet, while also partnering with the largest vending company in New England, A&B Vending. With over 500 facings across the USA, our team has proven the ability to bring a product to market. In addition, we have been featured in the likes of Forbes, Fortune, and Entrepreneur while also adding endorsements from major athletes in leagues from the NHL to the MLL.

<li>Bard's Beer is Truly Gluten-Free™ (no wheat, barley, rye or oats).</li>
<li>Bard's Beer is not “gluten reduced” like many of the alternatives on the market.</li>
<li>Bard's Beer tastes great!</li>
<li>Bard's Beer is refreshing to drink, with no bitter after-taste.</li>
<li>Bard's Beer is LABORATORY TESTED to be Gluten-free.</li>
<li>Bard's Beer was invented by Craig Belser, a diagnosed Celiac who understands the complex needs of this condition.</li>
<li>You don't have to be Celiac to benefit from Truly Gluten-Free™ beer!  <u>Many folks looking to reduce inflammation-causing substances in their body, yet still enjoy a great tasting beer are big fans of Bard's Beer.  </u>
</li>
</ul><p>But the #1 complaint about Bard's is this “<i>I can't ever find it when I want it!</i>”  </p><p>Bard's Beer customer Jim Brodie pretty much sums it up: “<i><strong>Just get me beer. I haven't been able to find you in years! I will pay whatever ransom is required to free the beer! Yes, seriously.</strong></i> “</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601063358/ym5zajewhdvchmery9ji.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That's right.  The only problem worse than a great product with no customers, is a great product with passionate customers, but you can't make enough product to satisfy demand!  We are currently brewing as much Bard's Beer as we can, but it's still not enough.  So, we need to add a second brewery line, and we need to expand distribution.  And we need to do it FAST.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601427016/njgzgzvsklx2lxbrcwly.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>In order to make this happen, and satisfy the tens of thousands of Bard's Beer fans across the US and Canada, this Indiegogo campaign has been launched.</p><p>Fund this Indiegogo to help us make MORE Bard's Beer, and you'll not only get great perks and swag, but you'll ensure Bard's Beer is available to gluten-free beer lovers everywhere!</p><h3><u><strong>Why we need funding</strong></u></h3><p>Bard's partners with brewers using our exacting recipe and specifications to brew the amazing product that gluten-free beer lovers all over North America know and love as Bard’s Beer. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, brewing capacity at brewers is uneven at best, and totally shut down in some cases.  Add to that the <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/07/15/aluminum-can-shortage-beer-soda-coca-cola-pepsico-covid-19/5443308002/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aluminum can shortage</a> that has been making headlines across America, and it's a situation that has made it VERY difficult for us to keep up with demand for Bard's.  </p><p>BUT, we are in the process of opening up not one, but TWO new brewers so we can get Bard's to everyone who wants it.  </p><p>The cost of opening these brewers is substantial, the brewmeisters have to be trained in the special and unique aspects of brewing sorghum based beer instead of wheat or barley.  Tens of thousands of aluminum cans need to be sourced, shipped and printed.  New cases for the beer need to be printed, and because we use our own proprietary sorghum sourced from a very specific area of the midwest we have to ship literally tons of sorghum into the new brewery. </p><p>All of these costs add up quickly. And like so many businesses during this tough time, cash is short for us as well.  </p><p>That's where you come in, with an opportunity to become a “Bard's Backer” and help us get these new brewers set up. </p><h3><strong><u>Why crowdfunding?</u></strong></h3><p>We are using Indiegogo for this project because by doing a crowdfunding campaign, we are hoping to increase coast-to-coast awareness of Bard's Beer, and engage our loyal customers to spread the word!</p><p>Additionally, the various events we have planned for this campaign, such as the Backyard BBQ, pizza party, Tasting Board, etc. are all designed to help bring FUN into the fund-raising process. It's a chance for us to get together to celebrate great beer, good friends and the magic that comes from supporting one another, especially in these tough times.

Bard's Beer is Truly Gluten-Free™ (no wheat, barley, rye or oats).
Bard's Beer is not “gluten reduced” like many of the alternatives on the market.
Bard's Beer tastes great!
Bard's Beer is refreshing to drink, with no bitter after-taste.
Bard's Beer is LABORATORY TESTED to be Gluten-free.
Bard's Beer was invented by Craig Belser, a diagnosed Celiac who understands the complex needs of this condition.
You don't have to be Celiac to benefit from Truly Gluten-Free™ beer!  Many folks looking to reduce inflammation-causing substances in their body, yet still enjoy a great tasting beer are big fans of Bard's Beer.  

But the #1 complaint about Bard's is this “I can't ever find it when I want it!”  Bard's Beer customer Jim Brodie pretty much sums it up: “Just get me beer. I haven't been able to find you in years! I will pay whatever ransom is required to free the beer! Yes, seriously. “     That's right.  The only problem worse than a great product with no customers, is a great product with passionate customers, but you can't make enough product to satisfy demand!  We are currently brewing as much Bard's Beer as we can, but it's still not enough.  So, we need to add a second brewery line, and we need to expand distribution.  And we need to do it FAST.   In order to make this happen, and satisfy the tens of thousands of Bard's Beer fans across the US and Canada, this Indiegogo campaign has been launched.Fund this Indiegogo to help us make MORE Bard's Beer, and you'll not only get great perks and swag, but you'll ensure Bard's Beer is available to gluten-free beer lovers everywhere!Why we need fundingBard's partners with brewers using our exacting recipe and specifications to brew the amazing product that gluten-free beer lovers all over North America know and love as Bard’s Beer. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, brewing capacity at brewers is uneven at best, and totally shut down in some cases.  Add to that the aluminum can shortage that has been making headlines across America, and it's a situation that has made it VERY difficult for us to keep up with demand for Bard's.  BUT, we are in the process of opening up not one, but TWO new brewers so we can get Bard's to everyone who wants it.  The cost of opening these brewers is substantial, the brewmeisters have to be trained in the special and unique aspects of brewing sorghum based beer instead of wheat or barley.  Tens of thousands of aluminum cans need to be sourced, shipped and printed.  New cases for the beer need to be printed, and because we use our own proprietary sorghum sourced from a very specific area of the midwest we have to ship literally tons of sorghum into the new brewery. All of these costs add up quickly. And like so many businesses during this tough time, cash is short for us as well.  That's where you come in, with an opportunity to become a “Bard's Backer” and help us get these new brewers set up. Why crowdfunding?We are using Indiegogo for this project because by doing a crowdfunding campaign, we are hoping to increase coast-to-coast awareness of Bard's Beer, and engage our loyal customers to spread the word!Additionally, the various events we have planned for this campaign, such as the Backyard BBQ, pizza party, Tasting Board, etc. are all designed to help bring FUN into the fund-raising process. It's a chance for us to get together to celebrate great beer, good friends and the magic that comes from supporting one another, especially in these tough times. Can't get that from a bank loan!How you can helpAs special Thank You for your support, we have exclusive perks in every range, up to and including a trip to our new contract brewers in St. Louis, Missouri OR Toronto, Canada to watch Bard's coming off the line, tasting and testing the batch before it's shipped...and even an opportunity to join us as a member of the Bard's Tasting Advisory Board, where you can help us develop, name and taste the NEWEST style of Bard's Beer!We need to raise at least $65,000 to cover all of the costs of getting both brewers set up and start to see Bard's flowing to the thirsty marketplace.If we don't hit that goal, we can still get set up with at least one of the two brewers, and continue to try our best to keep up with demands from stores and distributors.  We really hope that doesn't happen though, because once a retailer places an order, and we can't ship...well, they are pretty unforgiving about that, and there may never be another order from them again.  Bard's Backer PerksIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PERKS: All of the custom logo perks featured for this campaign were sourced from a company in Roseburg, Oregon, a small town in Southwestern Oregon. Roseburg has been mostly safe from the fires that have devastated the Pacific Northwest as of late, however MANY evacuees have been forced to seek shelter in small towns such as Roseburg. We wanted to let you know that your support of this Bard's Beer campaign will ALSO help support wildfire relief efforts, as the company has been heavily involved in supporting and taking care of evacuees during this difficult time.

Meet Zou Zou - Australia’s first coffee machine for creating delicious and authentic Turkish, Lebanese or Greek-style coffee in a new and convenient way.


 
CONVENIENT
No more waiting by the stovetop
When friends and family are over, be free to enjoy and entertain instead of waiting by the stovetop. Zou Zou is efficient and mess-free, giving you time for what really counts.

 
CONSISTENT
Your coffee, just as you like it
With Zou Zou, coffee is always consistent. It can prepare up to ten cups at a time, with every cup as perfect as the last.

 
AUTHENTIC
A fresh take on a rich tradition
Zou Zou is designed to suit the modern lifestyle, without compromising on the delicious and authentic taste and texture that we all love.

Innovative Design
Choose your mode
There are 3 modes - Automatic Mode makes your coffee with the ideal crema at the push of a button, while Manual Mode allows you to boil the coffee multiple times to your liking, as you would on a stovetop. 
Rinse Mode makes cleaning easy and mess-free. Just place your container under the spout and press start.  Stylish and robust
Zou Zou's streamlined stainless steel design makes it a stylish household appliance, while also being durable enough to hold up under the pressures of a commercial hospitality environment.  
Keeping with traditions
Whether in the comfort of the family home, or at a picturesque cafe along a bustling street, coffee is always present. Its rich aroma and unforgettable taste spark vibrant conversations and evoke cheerful memories.
Zou Zou was born out of a love for traditional Turkish, Lebanese, and Greek-style coffee — a technique that has bridged different countries and cultures, and brought together family and friends for generations. Our mission is to see this unique style and flavour carry on and reach future generations of coffee lovers.

Meet Our Team
Joseph Atallah
Designer & Inventor
Meet Joseph — the founder and inventor of Zou Zou. Originally from Lebanon, Joseph has worked as a chocolatier and in food science, both in Australia and abroad, for over 30 years.
From manufacturing soaps and fragrances to producing ice creams and gourmet chocolates, Joseph’s experience is vast. His Turkish coffee-enriched heritage and his passion for food science led him to develop Zou Zou, named after Joseph’s childhood nickname. “After years of development and rigorous testing here in Sydney, Australia, our team has created what we believe is the easiest way of making traditional Turkish coffee. It was important to us that we honour the tradition and experience of Turkish-style coffee, whilst also simplifying the process.” —Joseph

You can check here for ethical chocolate makers by clicking here - Food Empowerment Project and Slave Free Chocolate.Our belief in ethically sourcing through direct trade ensures transparency within the whole supply chain.By paying a premium price, this helps the farmers to continue growing cacao (considered a reforestation crop), which in turn helps improves biodiversity, whilst also creating positive social impacts within these farming communities. (We met cacao farmer Luis Mancini in 2017 at the start of our chocolate making journey) RECYCLING FACTS Recycling rates are increasing in the UK, but so is our population. British households create over 26 million tonnes of waste each year. This means that the average person in the UK throws away around 400kg of waste each year; 7 times their body weight.​It takes 70% less energy to recycle paper than it does to make it new from raw materials.​ Recycling everything you could in your kitchen recycling bins could power a TV for six months, plenty of time to binge watch your favourite programme!​​At Seed Chocolate we are very conscious of our responsibility toward the environment.Our new eco packaging is the first step of many.  From reforestation, to running a weather dependent neutral carbon micro factory, we want to grow organically & ethically.So whilst tasting great, It's helping the planet also! (Cacao pods grow on the trunk, unlike other crops around the world) WHAT WE NEED - OUR CAMPAIGN Eco packaging to match our award winning ethical chocolate. Our Indiegogo campaign is for £8,000.  This is needed to invest in: 

100% zero waste & biodegradable packaging.  Recycled cardboard outer.  Compostable inner pouch.  Plant based inks.  No Glue.

Small marketing opportunities.  UK & Staffordshire based.
We are extremely conscious of our carbon footprint.  We currently use FSC certified boxes, and also pop our own popcorn for inner packaging when shipping our chocolate & cocoa products.We are aiming to raise as much as possible, to help us stand toe to toe with our bean to bar competitors.The design is ready.  The COVID-19 pandemic stalled our plans, so now we need a little help to get this project over the line. EVERY £ COUNTS!!! As a small business, this investment really will help the long term future of Seed Chocolate, helping us to grow + scale sustainably. More chocolate = a better world.If we are unfortunate & fail to reach our goal of £8,000 then we aim to invest all of the raised funds into a scaled down version, to help us compete more sustainably. COLLABORATIONS We currently collaborate with some fantastic independent businesses in the UK.

Castletown Distillery, Staffordshire.

The Flintlock Restaurant, Staffordshire.

Simpsons Restaurant, Birmingham.
We are also proud cocoa bean suppliers to award winning Chocao Gin Liqueur.(A mock up of our proposed packaging) OUR INGREDIENTS We pride ourselves on using the finest organic ingredients.  Some are even foraged, fermented, pickled or dehydrated by head chocolate maker James Walter, to show off a range of flavour profiles that work in harmony with fine chocolate. True sustainable ingredients sourced in & around the UK.Our award winning chocolate is 100% FREE FROM soy & palm oil.  AWARDS & RECOGNITION This attention to detail has helped us achieve recognition and numerous awards from the following:The International Chocolate Awards - Silver, European, Africa & Middle East category (2019).The Guild of Fine Food (Great Taste Awards) - 2 stars (2020, 2019), 1 star (2020, 2018).The Academy of Chocolate Awards - Silver (2019), Bronze (2018).Great Taste ClubTaste of Staffordshire Awards (Enjoy Staffordshire) - Winner Specialist Food & Drink Retailer of the Year (2018).  EXCLUSIVE PERKS To help us to achieve our goal, we are offering some amazing perks & exclusive experiences for Indiegogo customers only.  COVID-19 MEASURES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON SELECTED CHOCOLATE EXPERIENCES IN ALIGNMENT WITH GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES.Experiences to be held in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire.  UK.  SHARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA Other Ways You Can Help We understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help: Please help our campaign by sharing with your family and friends.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Who is TeaFee?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Jin and I’m the founder of ""teafee"". I’ve always liked drinking a good cup of tea and as much as I like the taste of sweet milk coffee, however I’m very sensitive to caffeine. Caffeine makes me anxious and I often get upset stomach from it.</p>
<p>Decaf coffee is definitely not an option for someone who is athletic and cares a lot about health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One day I decided to try making my own alternative drink to tea and coffee. After months of trial and error with many different herbal ingredients I finally became satisfied with the smell and taste of my drink. ""teafee"" ended up as a drink that is neither tea not coffee, it’s a new beverage. It smells nice, is also delicious and healthy which is everything I ever wanted.  I especially love mixing it with some sugar and cream, leaving it in my fridge and enjoy drinking it chilled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few weeks later I decided to have a party at my home where I decided to serve teafee as a beverage and dessert to my friends and their guests. Not in a million years was I expecting such rave compliments and reactions from them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many asked if they could take some home.</p>
<p>The next few days I started getting texts and calls from my friends telling me how delicious it is, how it helps them sleep better, and that they feel more calm and less stressed. </p>
<p>Some even tried to convince me to turn this into a business. At the time I didn’t even know what to call my drink, let alone turn it into a business.</p>
<p>After the overwhelming support and encouragement I finally decided that I’d like to share my creation with as many people as possible. </p>
<p>But first, I need a name right? It’s not quite tea or coffee so what is it? This is when TeaFee was born.</p>

Who is TeaFee?
 
Hello, my name is Jin and I’m the founder of ""teafee"". I’ve always liked drinking a good cup of tea and as much as I like the taste of sweet milk coffee, however I’m very sensitive to caffeine. Caffeine makes me anxious and I often get upset stomach from it.
Decaf coffee is definitely not an option for someone who is athletic and cares a lot about health.
 
One day I decided to try making my own alternative drink to tea and coffee. After months of trial and error with many different herbal ingredients I finally became satisfied with the smell and taste of my drink. ""teafee"" ended up as a drink that is neither tea not coffee, it’s a new beverage. It smells nice, is also delicious and healthy which is everything I ever wanted.  I especially love mixing it with some sugar and cream, leaving it in my fridge and enjoy drinking it chilled.
 
A few weeks later I decided to have a party at my home where I decided to serve teafee as a beverage and dessert to my friends and their guests. Not in a million years was I expecting such rave compliments and reactions from them.
 
Many asked if they could take some home.
The next few days I started getting texts and calls from my friends telling me how delicious it is, how it helps them sleep better, and that they feel more calm and less stressed. 
Some even tried to convince me to turn this into a business. At the time I didn’t even know what to call my drink, let alone turn it into a business.
After the overwhelming support and encouragement I finally decided that I’d like to share my creation with as many people as possible. 
But first, I need a name right? It’s not quite tea or coffee so what is it? This is when TeaFee was born.
 
How Does Teafee Compare To Coffee?

Our Mission
 

TeaFee has helped me avoid caffeine, relieve stress and sleep better. While I’m losing weight I can tell it helps me with my digestion and how my body feels. 
TeaFee was originally made for my personal use, however with my friends’ encouragement they opened my mind that I’d like to share this great new product with as many people as I can so that it can help them like it helps me with my health while still enjoying a healthy drink with great taste.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Kendall Gendron and I have had a passion for crafting coffee for 10 years. I grew up in the Puget Sound area in Washington State, so it's easy to understand where my love of espresso came from. I have worked the entire spectrum of the coffee delivery system. From slinging commuter grade drip from a double sided, faced paced drive through stand, to foaming hundred of lattes a day at our favorite commercial giant, and finally at high end boutique cafes where perfect latte art is cultivated and mandatory.</p>
<p>My goal is to bring the best of all worlds to my new home in rural Vermont. What Vermont lacks in convenience, they make up for with beautiful landscapes and tight knit supportive communities. I wish to provide a service to those who value comfort, quality and accessibility.  My campaign is integral to starting my business. The funds I am requesting would be the good faith gesture needed for local financial institutions to provide the rest of my start up capital. Without the up front funds raised, my mentors and myself believe it will be a longer arduous  journey to my grand opening.</p>
<p>With backing from my contributors I will be able to fast track my services to the community. I want to invest in an area that needs a pick me up. Vermont needs small businesses. I want to give back to my wonderful state while simultaneously providing a future for myself I can be proud of building. Owning and operating my truck will be the most challenging and fulfilling adventure. It it my life's ambition to merge my craft into a career, and enrich the lives of my neighbors while I do it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's The Deal...</h3>
<p>I am hoping and anticipating to raise $15,000 to start my endeavor. The entirely of those funds will be used to purchase the biggest and most important piece of equipment I require: The Truck. I am seeking a modest, preferably used food truck for my business. I anticipate retrofitting all additional equipment myself and do not need to purchase an expensive custom made vehicle. I want to start smart, which means starting small. I am thrifty by nature so I plan on purchasing the majority of my equipment used, which means you can trust me to make the economically sound decisions.</p>
<p>I will be eternally grateful to anyone who chooses  to help support me and my dream career. To show my gratitude for funds raised, I am outlining levels of investment as an incentive to invest in me.</p>
<p>Levels of Investment:</p>
<ul>
<li>$10-$49 given will be a very appreciated donation, and I thank you dearly!</li>
<li>$50-$200 given will be considered a much appreciated donation and will receive a gift basket containing a pound of coffee beans and a VITTLES apron.</li>
<li>$201-$500 given will be considered a much appreciated donation with perks! If you donate to my start up I will provide you with a monthly package of a pound of coffee beans, and some VITTLES swag for 12 months. Additionally, if you live in the area of my truck you will be provided with a custom card entitling you to a free drink of your choice a week!</li>
<li>$501-$3000 will be considered the first level of investment. If you contribute within this bracket of funding I will consider you an investor in my business and I will payback the amount given over the course of 1 year with 8% interest in quarterly payments. As a small added bonus I will also send a monthly package of coffee beans and VITTLES swag.</li>
<li>$3001+ will be considered second level of investment. If you contribute more than this amount I will consider you a premier investor in my business and I will payback the amount given over the course of 2 years with 10% interest in quarterly payments. As a small added bonus I will also send a monthly package of coffee beans and VITTLES swag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any investor level contributor may request a copy of my business plan for further details about my journey into VITTLES.</p>
<p>Any contribution in ANY amount is appreciated more than you will ever imagine! I am so grateful for the opportunity to prove to my contributors that I will thrive with their help!</p>
<p>If my initial goal is not met I will use the funds to purchase the next largest piece of equipment needed to fulfill my business plan. Equipment includes, but is not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Espresso machine</li>
<li>Coffee roaster</li>
<li>Refrigerators</li>
<li>Drip coffee machines</li>
<li>Blenders</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Added Community Value</h3>
<p>The impact of raising these funds is insurmountable to me personally, but I genuinely believe I can add tremendous value to my neighborhood. I am a firm believer in locally sourced goods, nutritious food, and artfully crafted, delicious coffee. My goal is to provide a convenient way for Vermonters to have access to quality fun and tasty fare.</p>
<p>I want to be a driving force to bring added community value to my rural neck of the woods. I've learned that Vermonters are passionate about supporting local business and artfully crafted food and drink. Gastropubs and specialty food goods starting up in Vermont are dominating our green mountain landscape. I believe I am on the heels of this is rustic culinary renaissance.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risky?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I understand that investing in a new restaurant is one of the riskiest business decisions one can make. New restaurants often don't see their two year anniversary. This is usually due to inexperienced management making poor choices. Such as, constantly changing hours, exorbitant overhead costs, and not being able to adapt to their local market.</p>
<p>I have been in many management positions that have given me the necessary experience to confidently make the right choices for my business. However, my time as an hourly worker under poor management styles might be more valuable to me opening up my own business. watching failure in action is a tremendously helpful tool. I have seen countless mistakes that I now know how to effortlessly avoid. For Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will listen to my customers input and find the balance between my values and their needs.</li>
<li>My hours posted are the hours being met.</li>
<li>The whole premise of my business is to keep my overhead low, so I can have quality products sold at a reasonable price.</li>
<li>My truck is mobile. I can travel to where the commuters are.</li>
<li>I have a mentor through VtSBDC that I have been using extensively for sound advice. I will continue to learn from business owners smarter than myself to make the right decisions and to ensure my success.</li>
</ul>

<p>We work in an<strong> ecological way</strong>, with <strong>local</strong> and <strong>organic </strong>products. We take great care in choosing our suppliers, we meet them, we know their stories, we <strong>share our passion</strong> and our working methods. We share <strong>common values</strong>.</p>
<p><u><strong>We are Hush-Hush, a catering service whose values are respectful of the environment</strong></u>.<br/>An eco-catering service, organic and local, but not only. It is also a place where people can share, where workshops will be held regularly, for example: how to cook by reducing waste, or how to make laundry.</p>
<p>We believe we can <strong>help and inspire </strong>people to make our <strong><i>world greener</i></strong>. Besides, the restaurant and food service industries are highly polluting, and our goal is to change that.</p>

<h2>HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED</h2>
<p>To finance HUSH-HUSH, we need a total of $150,000. We set a goal of $25,000 so that with our own savings, we could own at least 50% of the company to make sure we could fulfill <strong>our core mission</strong> and <strong>be true to our original project</strong>. The remaining balance is to be added by one or more investors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555261990/fani0svqf96otw2jms7x.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Breakdown of the $150,000 investment :</strong></p>
<p>Security deposit: $60,000</p>
<p>Various equipment such as oven, baking supplies, cold storage: $40,000</p>
<p>Renovation of and construction in the facility: $30,000</p>
<p>Legal fees: $7,000</p>
<p>The remaining $13,000 will be used to cover the Indiegogo fees, and also to buy licenses, permits, and insurance, as well as small equipments such as eco-friendly utensils, plates, and glasses.</p>
<p>We’re hoping the funds we can raise exceed our $25,000 goal because the more we own the project, the truer it will be to what we have envisioned: <strong>local</strong> and/or <strong>organic food freshly</strong> served for all of your events, with a <strong>French touch</strong> and an <strong>environmental approach</strong>.</p>

WE BELIEVE IN A BETTER WORLD, WE BELIEVE IN AWARENESS, WE BELIEVE IN CHANGE,WE BELIEVE IN A WORLD WHERE THE CATERER INDUSTRY WILL NO LONGER POLLUTE LIKE TODAY
 
Our project: 
We work in an ecological way, with local and organic products. We take great care in choosing our suppliers, we meet them, we know their stories, we share our passion and our working methods. We share common values.
We are Hush-Hush, a catering service whose values are respectful of the environment.An eco-catering service, organic and local, but not only. It is also a place where people can share, where workshops will be held regularly, for example: how to cook by reducing waste, or how to make laundry.
We believe we can help and inspire people to make our world greener. Besides, the restaurant and food service industries are highly polluting, and our goal is to change that.
 

Carrots ready to be roasted.
 
Who we are:
We are Benjamin & Julie, 2 frenchy with 3 passions : COOKING, SUSTAINABILITY & NEW YORK. We live in New York City with our son. 

 
Julie:
I studied law and business management with the idea of creating my own business one day. I used to organize birthday parties for family, and great meals for friends. When I was living in France before moving to NYC, I worked in nightclubs, bars, and restaurants. 
 

 
Benjamin:
While passionate about planes and boats, I left my job as a manager at Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport (Paris), to follow our dream of entrepreneurship. I studied in Britany to become a chef. 
 
Us: 
We met over 12 years ago, and after our son was born, we became much more aware and passionate about environmental issues. 
We love to come up with innovative recipes using the most environmentally friendly ingredients, and with minimal waste. Benjamin makes our own laundry detergent from scratch. She was a speaker at a green conference in NYC where she explained the first steps to a greener home. 
 

 
 
EVERY DOLLAR CAN HELP
 
HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED
To finance HUSH-HUSH, we need a total of $150,000. We set a goal of $25,000 so that with our own savings, we could own at least 50% of the company to make sure we could fulfill our core mission and be true to our original project. The remaining balance is to be added by one or more investors.

 
Breakdown of the $150,000 investment :
Security deposit: $60,000
Various equipment such as oven, baking supplies, cold storage: $40,000
Renovation of and construction in the facility: $30,000
Legal fees: $7,000
The remaining $13,000 will be used to cover the Indiegogo fees, and also to buy licenses, permits, and insurance, as well as small equipments such as eco-friendly utensils, plates, and glasses.
We’re hoping the funds we can raise exceed our $25,000 goal because the more we own the project, the truer it will be to what we have envisioned: local and/or organic food freshly served for all of your events, with a French touch and an environmental approach.

Our suppliers are chosen with care, like this one, upstate New York City. 
 
Please talk about and share our project and campaign on social media: this could make a big difference in helping us reach our goal The more exposure our project gets, the more likely it is to succeed!
Please, spread the word!! We are counting on you. THANK YOU!!!!
   

 Challenges : The only challenges we could see from this project is getting serious demand, which would just mean we'd need some extra time to make and ship for backers of this Indiegogo campaign._______ Homeless eat crepes for Thanksgiving.   ***Version Française *** Qui sommes-nous ?Nous sommes Benjamin et Julie, deux français avec deux passions: la CUISINE et L’ECOLOGIE. Nous vivons à New York avec notre fils. Julie:J'ai étudié le droit et le management d'entreprise dans l'idée de créer un jour ma propre entreprise. Passionnée par la gastronomie, j'avais l'habitude d'organiser des fêtes, des anniversaires pour ma famille et des bons repas pour mes amis. Avant de venir à New York, alors que je vivais encore en France, j’ai travaillé dans des discothèques, des bars et des restaurants. Benjamin:Passionné d'avions et de bateaux, j'ai quitté mon poste de responsable à l'aéroport de Roissy Charles de Gaulle (Paris) pour poursuivre notre rêve d'entreprendre. J'ai étudié en Bretagne pour devenir chef. Nous:Nous nous sommes rencontrés il y a plus de 12 ans et, après la naissance de notre fils, nous sommes devenus encore plus conscients et passionnés par les questions environnementales.Nous proposons des recettes innovantes en utilisant des ingrédients respectueux de l'environnement et avec un minimum de déchets. Benjamin fabrique notre propre détergent à lessive.  Elle a été invité à partager son parcours écologique lors d'une conférence à New York, où elle a expliqué son cheminement vers un mode de vie plus responsable et les clés pour se lancer.Nous pensons pouvoir aider et inspirer les gens à rendre notre monde plus respectueux de la nature. De plus, les industries de la restauration et des services alimentaires sont très polluants et notre objectif est de changer cela.  Notre projet:Nous croyons en un monde meilleur, nous croyons aux prises de conscience, nous croyons au changement. Nous croyons à un monde ou la restauration ne polluera plus comme aujourd’hui.Nous travaillons de manière écologique, avec des produits locaux et biologiques. Nous prenons un grand soin dans le choix de nos fournisseurs, nous les rencontrons, nous connaissons leurs histoires, nous échangeons sur notre passion et sur nos méthodes de travail. Nous partageons des valeurs communes.Nous sommes un service traiteur dont les valeurs sont respectueuses de l’environnement.Un service traiteur écolo, bio et local, mais pas que. C’est aussi un lieu d'échange où se tiendront régulièrement des ateliers comme par exemple; comment cuisiner en réduisant ses déchets, ou comment fabriquer sa lessive.Un service de restauration, oui, mais plus encore, une COMMUNAUTÉ.Sucettes de fromage de chèvre au paprika , au romarin et au graines de sésames, prête à être emportées.  Pourquoi avoir appeler notre service traiteur ainsi? Parce que nos clients nous demandent de la confidentialité pour leur événement. Et par la suite nous aimerions créer des événements encore plus secrets ;) Mais on vous en dira plus une prochaine fois...  CHAQUE EUROS PEUT AIDER COMMENT LES FONDS SERONT UTILISÉS ?Pour financer HUSH-HUSH, il nous faut 150 000 dollars au total.

<p>With our freeze-dried baby and everyone food all you have to do is add water, formula, breast milk or other liquid to quickly rehydrate the food. The packets have a long shelf life and don’t need to be refrigerated which make them perfect for on the go parents. We do not add any fillers or additives to our freeze dried food so our product is also awesome to add to smoothies, soups, dips and more! This is not just organic baby food its for everyone! It is a super easy way to sneak in extra fruit and veggies for picky toddlers (or adults)! Be sure to watch our blog and social media for recipes.</p>
<p>Our foods are single ingredients to make introducing solids easy for babies. Many other foods are mixed flavors which makes it difficult to make sure little ones get used to foods one by one. One ingredient foods let your child learn to like veggies without being hidden in other foods. They also help parents filter out any foods your child may be allergic to. In addition, have you ever noticed how many foods have banana/ apple or other fruits mixed in with the veggies? We are working on more vegetable flavors for that reason. Get your littles started on the right track and open them up to savory flavors too!</p>
<p>The vegetables are what we really want to focus on but they are harder to source. By backing our campaign you can help us research and develop more savory flavors!</p>

<h3>Here's where it began...the Goodness story!</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Doyin and I was born and raised in South East London, UK! I've always had a knack for creating things that bring wholesomeness to those on the receiving end! Goodness M*lk does exactly that - my new plant-based m*lk range is hand-made with care using all natural ingredients found in your kitchen - so no surprises!</p>
<p>Founded in London from my desire to make my family and friends feel good during the height of the pandemic lockdown just a few months ago, I decided to get the blender out and make some plant-based m*lk beverages. Seeing the positive reaction of the rich flavour, velvety taste and versatility of the m*lk from my family and friends I decided it was time to spread some more Goodness! Goodness M*lk was born the next day, early July 2020 that is! I've been working tirelessly on my new line of plant-based milk, to ensure that my hand-made speciality oat, almond and coconut m*lk is delivered in a safe manner to customers across London, UK.</p>
<p>My goal is to be a positive force in food and drink industry and serve Goodness for All! ...because yes, health and good food choices should not be accessed by a small few...but to all!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600470370/vrgfmmyfl3bpcs9tnkpu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What’s Goodness M*lk all about?</h3>
<p>Goodness M*lk is the first range of products under my new Brand, Goodness the Brand Ltd, a brand empowering individuals to find whatever it is that brings 'goodness' to their world. Just as I began my m*lk making journey a few months ago I want us all to use Goodness M*lk as a source of inspiration and newness. Whether that’s by using this new M*lk to make a new morning smoothie or you use it to discover a new baking recipe or even to discover what it is that makes you feel good, I want you to find your thing!</p>
<p>Goodness M*lk is certified organic*, dairy-free and if you have a bit of the sweet tooth (just like me) our sweetened range comes naturally sweetened with dates!</p>
<p> </p>

All our m*lk beverages are hand-made in my kitchen using only the good stuff (all ingredients below)! I pride myself in making great tasting nourishing m*lk! After a decade of consuming m*lk alternative drinks it's safe to say i've finessed all the goodness from over the years and brought it over to Goodness M*lk!</p>

<h3>So why crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Crowdfunding involves community. With your community support you'll be part of the Goodness journey from the start! This product range will be an incredible addition to our community and this approach to serve you with your support makes all the difference. Your support will help launch one of the first black owned plant-based m*lk products in the UK! This project embodies community and sharing wholesomeness together so I'm really excited to share this journey with you from the get-go!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>This is an exciting journey as a very early start up and by purchasing one of our perks you support our mission to encourage Goodness in the way we eat, drink and build community! As an entrepreneur with a great vision yet minimal resources, your contribution will help me with the production and packaging to offer these new hand-made m*lk products to you...and you!</p>
<p>I am extremely conscious of our carbon footprint as a community and will work as effective as possible to minimise this during production, shipping and delivery process.</p>

<p>Stretch goal - £10,000! If I reach my stretch goal I will be able to purchase 3 exceptionally powerful catering blenders (Santos Kitchen Blender 37A 4Ltr Stainless Steel, £1,149.99) that will allow me to make more Goodness M*lk efficiently, which means we will get Goodness M*lk delivered to you much quicker!

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I truly love that I get to create a brand new fun and exciting plant-based m*lk line and as with any big idea, once executed the doubts flow through! Turning to crowdfunding to launch a plant-based m*lk range is rare in London, so there are some risks there including the great amount of unknown challenges especially during these unprecedented times of the Covid-19 pandemic. The main risk when we get funded is the delay in early production and deliverables due to last minute challenges exacerbated by Covid-19 restrictions and other unforeseen circumstances. But I have no doubt we will succeed in the end, because where there is community there is power to move faster together! I will update my backers on a regular basis and communicate any delays promptly.</p>
<p>If I don’t meet my funding target, I will produce a smaller batch of Goodness M*lk then once I have secured alternative funding I will seek to serve the wider community.

</div></div>","Here's where it began...the Goodness story!
Hi, my name is Doyin and I was born and raised in South East London, UK! I've always had a knack for creating things that bring wholesomeness to those on the receiving end! Goodness M*lk does exactly that - my new plant-based m*lk range is hand-made with care using all natural ingredients found in your kitchen - so no surprises!
Founded in London from my desire to make my family and friends feel good during the height of the pandemic lockdown just a few months ago, I decided to get the blender out and make some plant-based m*lk beverages. Seeing the positive reaction of the rich flavour, velvety taste and versatility of the m*lk from my family and friends I decided it was time to spread some more Goodness! Goodness M*lk was born the next day, early July 2020 that is! I've been working tirelessly on my new line of plant-based milk, to ensure that my hand-made speciality oat, almond and coconut m*lk is delivered in a safe manner to customers across London, UK.
My goal is to be a positive force in food and drink industry and serve Goodness for All! ...because yes, health and good food choices should not be accessed by a small few...but to all!
 

 
What’s Goodness M*lk all about?
Goodness M*lk is the first range of products under my new Brand, Goodness the Brand Ltd, a brand empowering individuals to find whatever it is that brings 'goodness' to their world. Just as I began my m*lk making journey a few months ago I want us all to use Goodness M*lk as a source of inspiration and newness. Whether that’s by using this new M*lk to make a new morning smoothie or you use it to discover a new baking recipe or even to discover what it is that makes you feel good, I want you to find your thing!
Goodness M*lk is certified organic*, dairy-free and if you have a bit of the sweet tooth (just like me) our sweetened range comes naturally sweetened with dates!
 

 

Goodness M*lk is placed in glass milk bottles for extra nostalgia freshness and delivered straight to your door on the day of production! 
Goodness M*lk is for those that are lactose intolerant, meat eaters, vegans, vegetarians, plant-basers and everyone in between - it's Goodness for all! All our m*lk beverages are hand-made in my kitchen using only the good stuff (all ingredients below)! I pride myself in making great tasting nourishing m*lk! After a decade of consuming m*lk alternative drinks it's safe to say i've finessed all the goodness from over the years and brought it over to Goodness M*lk!
 

Our m*lk bottles are all 100% recyclable and reusable!
Return 9 bottles and you'll get your 10th bottle on us (yes for free)! Our delivery team will take your bottles on delivery so it's a hassle-free transaction bringing back the old school m*lk wo(man), Goodness style!
 
The design is ready! I just need your help for our 100% sustainable packaging and the printing production
 

 

 

 

 
Here's the all natural ingredients:
Oat M*lk: organic oats, filtered water, pinch of sea salt, cashews (allergic to cashews? No worries - you can order the cashew-free option)
Almond M*lk: organic almonds, filtered water, pinch of sea salt
Coconut M*lk: coconuts, filtered water, pinch of sea salt
Our 3 m*lks are available unsweetened and sweetened (we use dates as a natural sweetener!)
 
Goodness M*lk, delivered straight to your door - from my kitchen to your door. Here’s how it'll work: 
 

 
Two delivery methods - bike & car delivery

<p><b>eto</b> is a beautifully designed wine decanter that gives you the freedom to enjoy wine at your own pace, and never waste a drop again.

<p>After taking part in a similar blind taste test, Wine Director at Honest Grapes, Tom Harrow, commented “A wine which had been decanted (into <b>eto</b>) seven days beforehand tasted every bit as fresh as a wine which had come from a recently opened bottle. But it also had the added benefits of decanting, in that the wine was breathing ... it was opening up ... it tasted absolutely delicious.” </p>

<p>Wine wastage is a huge environmental problem across the world. In the UK alone, 50 million litres of wine are poured down the sink every year - see WRAP report EVA063. A recent study by Laithwaite’s Wine put the figure down as enough to fill 333 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and also these disturbing statistics: </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our inability to preserve wine once the cork has been popped is a major cause of this wine waste. And I quickly discovered that the wine preservation products on the market were either ineffective or hugely expensive. </p>

<p>My inspiration for <b>eto</b> came after a friend highlighted the method - common amongst wine experts - of transferring leftover wine into a smaller container to minimise the air contact. After experimenting, I found the method of reducing air exposure very effective. I just needed to work on the container… </p>

<p>After months of exploration I filed a patent for an innovative design in September 2012. At the core of the invention was a new unique valve concept that sealed wine at exactly the right moment, no matter how much wine was left. </p>
<div data-id=""16724227""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1498662706/hp4qzmnbc86ncwgxrla8.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>The ‘design for manufacture’ stage brought significant challenges. Not only did the valve require costly ‘proof of concept’ prototyping, experts in the glass industry said the precision required for glass simply couldn’t be achieved within the cost.  </p>

<p>After a highly rigorous and competitive process, I was awarded an Innovate UK government grant to develop eto further. This support proved invaluable, allowing me to build over 60 functioning prototypes, develop a detailed manufacture design and test eto’s effectiveness in the laboratory. </p>

<p>All materials are food approved and fully compliant with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the German BfR, ensuring they have no effect on the wine’s flavour. All materials are also BPA free. </p>
<ul>
<li>The glass used in eto is high precision ‘toughened’ borosilicate glass that’s optically clear &amp; ‘seam free’ to optimise the wine colour. The glass has increased heat &amp; shatter resistance, and won't stain or absorb any odours.</li>
<li>High grade Stainless steel with anti-corrosion properties and antimicrobial finish.</li>
<li>PVD coating creates a tough finish that is approximately ten times harder than stainless steel itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>eto</b> dissembles into four main parts and these can be individually replaced if damaged. (Although we do not foresee any reason to replace parts due to natural wear &amp; tear.)</p>

<p>As glass specification was one of our major challenges, we undertook extensive research before selecting a glass manufacturer who we were confident could achieve the consistent glass tolerance required for eto without spiralling costs. High standards in worker treatment and environmental impact were also essential.  </p>
<p>We have worked closely with our manufacturing and assembly partner for over two years. They have over 30 years of experience bringing premium houseware products to market, and their skilled quality control team inspect each product before shipping.</p>
<p>eto has taken several years to perfect, as we have built multiple prototypes to improve and simplify its design. We now have a product with minimal parts, precision-engineered seam-free glass, and high grade, anti-corrosion stainless steel that is both durable and aesthetic.</p>

eto is a beautifully designed wine decanter that gives you the freedom to enjoy wine at your own pace, and never waste a drop again. Its innovative, patented preservation system uses an airtight seal to keep wine perfectly fresh for at least 7 days, as proven by blind taste tests carried out with 'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming, and independent laboratory testing at Bangor University.

 
eto is easy to use - its unique design ensures every step is quick, clean and complements the traditional ritual of enjoying wine.

  

Due to its patented preservation system that creates an airtight seal over the wine, eto halts the oxidation process, which in turn preserves the wine’s freshness and taste. 

As we become more health-consciousness, more and more of us are choosing to enjoy just a glass or two rather than several – or even save our wine drinking for the weekend. eto gives us this freedom. 

With eto you can open and savour that treasured bottle over a longer period. 

The long funnel gently oxygenates the wine to release its flavours and the sharp lip ensures drip-free pouring. 

  
No waste, and no need to rush to finish the bottle (or the next one...)
  

 
eto’s ability to prevent wine oxidation has been proven by independent tests carried out at Bangor University. The graph shows just how effective eto is compared to other wine preservation products.

eto underwent rigorous testing and re-testing over a 12 month period with a variety of red and white wines. The results were indisputable - eto far out-performed competitor products in every tightly-monitored test.  


 
While science proved eto prevented oxidation, blind taste tests with wine experts showed that eto protected the quality of the wine too.  
 
 
 
'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming – and writer at JancisRobinson.com – took part in two separate blind taste tests, comparing freshly opened wine with its eto 7 day preserved equivalent.  “On the seventh day ... for me, the results were unanimous: there was no perceptible difference between a freshly opened bottle and the eto-stored sample” Read the full article HERE.
 

 
After taking part in a similar blind taste test, Wine Director at Honest Grapes, Tom Harrow, commented “A wine which had been decanted (into eto) seven days beforehand tasted every bit as fresh as a wine which had come from a recently opened bottle. But it also had the added benefits of decanting, in that the wine was breathing ... it was opening up ... it tasted absolutely delicious.” 
 

 
I am Tom Cotton, an award-winning industrial designer with nearly 20 years experience of bringing products from concept to market. I am passionate about protecting the environment, and in 2011 became interested in designing a product that helped to reduce wine wastage.
Wine wastage is a huge environmental problem across the world. In the UK alone, 50 million litres of wine are poured down the sink every year - see WRAP report EVA063. A recent study by Laithwaite’s Wine put the figure down as enough to fill 333 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and also these disturbing statistics: 
 

 
Our inability to preserve wine once the cork has been popped is a major cause of this wine waste. And I quickly discovered that the wine preservation products on the market were either ineffective or hugely expensive. 

My inspiration for eto came after a friend highlighted the method - common amongst wine experts - of transferring leftover wine into a smaller container to minimise the air contact. After experimenting, I found the method of reducing air exposure very effective. I just needed to work on the container… 
 

  

  

After months of exploration I filed a patent for an innovative design in September 2012. At the core of the invention was a new unique valve concept that sealed wine at exactly the right moment, no matter how much wine was left. 

The ‘design for manufacture’ stage brought significant challenges. Not only did the valve require costly ‘proof of concept’ prototyping, experts in the glass industry said the precision required for glass simply couldn’t be achieved within the cost.  

After a highly rigorous and competitive process, I was awarded an Innovate UK government grant to develop eto further. This support proved invaluable, allowing me to build over 60 functioning prototypes, develop a detailed manufacture design and test eto’s effectiveness in the laboratory. 

  

Five years on, we have a product that really works. eto looks beautiful, preserves wine brilliantly and is exceptionally easy to use, store and maintain.  

We have built a strong relationship with our chosen manufacturing partner, and use only the highest quality materials to ensure eto is effective, elegant and durable in the long term. 

All materials are food approved and fully compliant with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the German BfR, ensuring they have no effect on the wine’s flavour. All materials are also BPA free. 

The glass used in eto is high precision ‘toughened’ borosilicate glass that’s optically clear & ‘seam free’ to optimise the wine colour. The glass has increased heat & shatter resistance, and won't stain or absorb any odours.
High grade Stainless steel with anti-corrosion properties and antimicrobial finish.
PVD coating creates a tough finish that is approximately ten times harder than stainless steel itself.

eto dissembles into four main parts and these can be individually replaced if damaged. (Although we do not foresee any reason to replace parts due to natural wear & tear.)

As glass specification was one of our major challenges, we undertook extensive research before selecting a glass manufacturer who we were confident could achieve the consistent glass tolerance required for eto without spiralling costs. High standards in worker treatment and environmental impact were also essential.  
We have worked closely with our manufacturing and assembly partner for over two years. They have over 30 years of experience bringing premium houseware products to market, and their skilled quality control team inspect each product before shipping.
eto has taken several years to perfect, as we have built multiple prototypes to improve and simplify its design. We now have a product with minimal parts, precision-engineered seam-free glass, and high grade, anti-corrosion stainless steel that is both durable and aesthetic.
 

 
 
Back eto and become part of our story. Once the campaign is over, we will be in touch to collect your shipping address details. We will then keep you updated throughout the process, and you will become one of the first people to enjoy using eto. 
 

eto is a unique and innovative product, and would make a great gift for any wine drinker. If you would like to buy eto for someone special, simply download the ‘gift card’ (from the link below) which can be printed, or sent electronically.

eto is easy to clean – simply rinse with hot water straight after use and avoid using detergents. Please note, the metal parts of eto are not dishwasher safe. 

To make eto viable, we've already raised £55,000 for our tooling. This diagram shows you how your money will be allocated. Additional funds will be used to increase production. 
 
  

eto's creator Tom Cotton is an award winning industrial designer with nearly 20 years experience creating 3D product & packaging designs for some of the world’s leading brands. He has a passion for delivering fresh, breakthrough designs that reflect a high-level of consumer and market understanding, and has a strength for balancing design and technology constraints, often working through tough issues until they are resolved.   

Tom is cited as ‘inventor’ on over 18 international patents for consumer products, and has been extensively involved in the development and commercialisation of IP. His enthusiasm for innovation and problem solving is balanced by a detailed understanding of manufacturing, materials, IP & business realities. He’s created structural pack forms and product designs for clients including Gillette, Diageo, Procter & Gamble, Absolute vodka, Bacardi and Nestle.
 

I am a London based Welshman and, like many of my countrymen, proud of my roots. The word eto means ‘again’ in Welsh, which perfectly sums up the joy of the product. eto allows you to enjoy wine again, and again – without sacrificing either its taste or our planet.

Indiegogo is a proven start-up platform with a community of ‘early adopters’ who help vet, fund and refine new products. For innovative entrepreneurs who want to realise their vision, the pioneering Indiegogo community offers the most supportive platform. We highly value the Indiegogo community and its role in supporting innovation and hope that together we can launch eto. We’re not on Indiegogo to make a big margin; we’re here to build a community of early adopters who can also help us decide what eto will do next.  
Join us in bringing this collaboration to life – we can't do it without you!

  

We couldn’t have created eto without the help and support of friends and family, all of whom who have encouraged us to launch our new product through Crowdfunding. In particular, a big thanks to Shish Patel, Steve Challouma, Ellie MacLeod, Mike Webster, Sarah Clarke-Wareham, Paula Zuccotti, Ed Adamson, Olly Chambers, Mark Armstrong, Ian Webb, Felix Scarlett, Tom Herman, Jon Sleeman, Gareth Thomas, Mark Shickle, Raj Sood, Ben Scales, Henry & Kath Rowe, Rae Stewart, Sine Sorensen, Paul Wilford, Aaron Probyn, Hannah Thomas and Katy Gandon for marketing guidance, and Siwan Jones and Andrei Saltykov from Lacey Saltykov for letting us use their amazing house for the photo-shoot. And finally, a special thanks goes to Adrian Barton for highlighted the method - common amongst wine experts - of transferring leftover wine into a smaller containers.

  

As shipping, handling and other local charges (excluding customs fees) vary from country to country, please select your reward tier to see more information about the shipping details relevant to you. Please be aware that we cannot mark any shipments as gifts due to legality issues.  Customs & Duties - import duties and taxes are not included in our reward levels. These charges vary by country and are completely out of our control, but please be aware that you will be responsible for any charges or taxes that apply to your country.
We can ship to most countries in the world. We are working with a fulfilment company to make shipping as simple as possible. Shipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will incur additional costs to be reshipped.
Due to the size of your rewards, we cannot ship to PO Boxes.  
Estimated Delivery: Once production is complete on all orders, we will provide updates for shipping dates. International shipping can be subject to unexpected delays that are outside of our control. However, we will do our utmost to ship within the predicted time frame.  

We will be sharing steps of our production journey on social media so follow us to keep up to date with our news. And thank you so much for helping our family start-up bring this beautiful innovation in wine preservation to market. We can't wait to get your new eto to you.  
 

If you like the look of eto, but aren’t quite ready to pledge, you can help us make eto a success by sharing our posts on social media, giving us your feedback and telling your friends and family about eto and our Indiegogo campaign.  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 

When wine is continually exposed to air, the oxygen reacts with certain phenolic compounds in the wine and causes their oxidation, which results in:  

Loss of fruit characters
Reduced Aroma
Increase in bitterness as a result of the development of acetaldehyde
Unwanted bacteria and yeast such as Acetobacter aceti, Lactic acid bacteria, and Brettanomyces starting to thrive. 
Lower antioxidants - such as quercetin and resveratrol. Research has shown this plays a part in helping to prevent heart disease and cancer",51.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Be A Part of<strong> Austin's Food History:  Preserve the Ruby's Original BBQ Pit!</strong>
</h3>
<p>Hello Dear Friend! My name is Chef Demmerick Johnson, and I am the owner of Ladybird's Austin Kitchen.  I have personally worked in most of the top kitchens in Austin.  I've been cooking for over 30 years, with most of that time here in my beloved Austin. Over those years, I've had successful careers in sales, marketing, and insurance. Somehow, I've always found myself back ""On the Line!"" I came here to Austin in 1990 to study economics, not knowing I would fall in love with creating great food! Weeks before Ruby's was to close, two friends mentioned the final sale over at the restaurant, and needing a few sheet trays I accidentily showed up 4 days early. While looking over the wares, I started talking to Ruby's family members, and decided to come back the next day.  I returned the next day after that, and the next after that. By Friday, I had taken ""ownership"" of Ruby's BBQ, it somehow had become my family! When family moves on , you cherish or sing their ""Legend"" in some amazing way!</p>
<p>I wish to save the almost 30 year old Original Heirloom BBQ Pit! As Matthew Odam said,"" One of the great relics of the Austin BBQ Scene will live on.""  This task is GARGANTUAN, DIFFICULT (...I was injured numerous times working by myself), HEAVY, DELICATE, and IMPORTANT to future generations.  Ruby's was more than BBQ, it served as a center for community, family, and Austin culture. It is one of the last examples of  ""OLD"" Austin.  Thousands and thousands of us have celebrated, cried and laughed around these BBQ Pits. To BBQ afficianados, they are priceless! You can't walk into a store and buy 30 year seasoned BBQ Pits! We don't have to cry ""Remember When"", by getting involved with the preservation of the Original Ruby's BBQ Pits! Join me, and Be A Part of Austin Food History Today!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time is our biggest concern. The new tenant of the Ruby's BBQ space must move in soon. We need $15,000: a) To hire additional staff to speed up this entire process.; b) To purchase a higher quality cryovac machine, in order to shrink wrap the bricks in plastic. (NO, we weren't going to put these prized pieces on the floor in someone's garage!); c) Hire a transport company to carefully transport &amp; store the BBQ Pit in a Temperature controlled storage space.; d) Lastly, we will need help reconstructing this beloved treasure ""brick by brick"".</li>
<li>Any amount is welcome! Your willingness to simply stop and listen to our plea, is in some ways homage enough. On the issue of perks, any donation over $100 receives a beautiful commemorative plaque and their family name fashioned above the newly reconstructed BBQ Pit in its new location.  Any donation above $1000 receives a complimentary dinner for four (4) at Ladybird's Austin Kitchen, and ringside access to the actual rebuilding of this piece of BBQ History!</li>

<h3>Your Impact</h3>

<h3>Why Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>We feel that crowdfunding is a great match for us because we have small market conditions with a diverse global appeal and this way our many supporters can get directly involved in the process of broadening our offerings, increasing safety and efficiency as we grow, and advancing our use of biodegradable and eco-friendly products.</p>
<p>In addition to our service at the bistro, we are developing promotional events and private booking opportunities with aims of developing community contribution, challenging our company’s growth potential, and advancing our core philosophies and brand awareness.</p>
<p>Our unique offering promises to impact the local dialogue immediately and we can maintain that interest by holding to our core principles: “focusing on “home, health, and inclusion” ; “proactive cost awareness”; “approaching food service with novel attitudes and technological solutions and giving preference to nutrition and local sources.</p>
<p>The long-term success of our ambitious project can be ensured by YOUR GENEROUS CONTRIBUTION. As our world becomes ever more connected, it becomes apparent that we are all neighbors and proactive causes like ours, striving to make positive impacts at home, in our local community, are really part of a global fellowship of progress. </p>
<h3>How Will We Spend It?</h3>
<p>Your contributions allow us to keep an uncompromising focus on our core values. Biodegradable take-away packaging is more expensive. Even with our network of local growers and distributors, the highest quality ingredients are more expensive. Operating in a smaller country with limited logistical development can make it expensive to obtain the equipment and material we need to maintain our standards. Hiring the best available staff, and providing them the necessary tools for success also has a cost.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We have set our funding goal based on our projected capital needs, but falling a little short wouldn't be a catastrophe because we have already demonstrated our ability to adapt to and anticipate our industry environment.</span></p>
<h3>What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>We've been working on two sets of PERKS to show our appreciation for your contribution. If you live in Bulgaria, we're sending you Bulgarian craft beer, decor items modeled after the bistro's atmosphere, and cool 11:11 Bistro swag. International donors are getting selections from the TASTE OF BULGARIA collection, comprised of Bulgarian calendars (the worlds most accurate EVER),  Martenitsi, and products made from Bulgaria's world famous rose oils.

<h3>What Are We About?</h3>
<p>My name is Aaron Moma. I am the owner of The River Coffee Company. From an early age my parents taught me to value working with my hands and the craftsmanship that goes into learning a particular skill. This has translated into my passions in working with coffee.  </p>
<p>As a young child my first sips of coffee took place at my grandmas house as family gathered around the dinner table laughing together and carrying on in conversation. These experiences have shaped my desire to share my love for coffee with the world.  Coffee is a global beverage that has participated in bringing people together and building relationships for centuries.</p>
<p>The River Coffee Company seeks to bring this experience to the heart of Decatur. Decatur is a hardworking, growing community and its people are worn and weary. The River Coffee Company seeks to bring rest and restoration back to the people. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get...</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Building a coffee shop from the ground up has proven itself challenging and the 100 year old building that we are currently in needs some updates and renovations. We are in need of at least $30,000.  This will help us purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>New HVAC System- $3,000</li>
<li>Electrical- $2,000</li>
<li>Flooring- $1,000</li>
<li>Bar- $1,000</li>
<li>Refrigerator- $2,000</li>
<li>Water Warmer- $1,000</li>
<li>Espresso Machine- $10,500- $17,000</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The River coffee company will provide a great space for people of all ages to get together and connect.  For the business man or woman, this will be a quaint space for meetings to take place.  Coffee has been a social beverage for years and Downtown Decatur needs a place to connect or reconnect with friends and family. Relationships are important  and we want to create space that invites social interaction as well as rest.</p>
<p>Because of Decatur's growing community many people throughout the town have unmet needs and The River Coffee Company seeks to help meet those needs by partnering with and supporting the local missions around town.  Our primary focus is the people of Decatur and its surrounding areas, but we are aware of global issues and seek to support foreign missions as well.  Through the help of your support The River Coffee Company will have a global reach that goes well beyond our local community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Without The River Coffee Company, the needs of Decatur will grow and have a greater potential of remaining unmet. If we do not succeed in this campaign, Downtown Decatur may seemingly stay the same, but it will loose the possibility for another great meeting place. Yet, with the success of this campaign, relationships will blossom, friendships will form, and business deals will be made--all at the River.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please spread the word about our campaign, mission, and coffee shop.</li>

<h2><strong>Founders' Foreword:</strong></h2>
<p>Beer makes us happy, but the craft food and beverage industry keeps us endlessly curious. Craft beer and liquor sales are up, patrons carry pride in eating and drinking local, and disposable incomes continue to rise. The growth in popularity of craft drinks and local fare has provided the industry with an influx of highly talented, passionately driven, and endlessly creative innovators with the hope of satisfying every consumer’s gastrological curiosity.</p>
<p>However, many watching the industry fear certain saturations in the market - especially for breweries. This concern instills hesitation in brewers looking to break into the industry with their own business or experiment with product too broadly. Even further, production breweries struggle to justify using tank space for experimentation or collaboration given the production impact on current offerings.</p>
<p><strong>That’s where we come in.</strong></p>
<p>With careers in music and the arts, Dan and Jordan came up with the idea for Pilot Project after realizing how many other creative industries have dedicated spaces for artists to do their work. Photography studios, recording studios, art lofts, test kitchens -- there's no shortage.</p>
<p>Pilot Project: a “guerrilla” brewery incubator and tasting room accomplishes just that for the beer industry. Designed to provide brewing resources to an industry that demands a $1M+ barrier to entry, we will support upstart businesses and day-dreaming home brewers, encourage small-batch experimentation and collaboration across the industry, and provide consumer market testing in our lovely tasting room. Plus, we all get to drink great beer.</p>

<p>I and my supporters are on a mission to help eliminate 80 Billion Plastic Bottles that are thrown into our oceans &amp; landfills, and are choking to death our wildlife, sea mammals and eventually ourselves. 80 Billion Plastic Bottles that contain drinking water and then end up polluting Earth while major multi-national companies reap billions in profits-<strong>WHAT A DISGRACE!</strong></p>
<p><strong>IT'S SIMPLE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM and WE HAVE STARTED TO DO IT!</strong></p>
<p>Our 100% Plant Based Bottle filled with award winning Canadian Spring Water and 100% Compostable is the answer. Our cap is also compostable .</p>
<p>We accept subscription orders direct on our website and through Shopify and allow students to deliver and pick up empty bottles to compost, completing the circle of life.</p>
<p><strong>A GREAT BUSINESS MODEL!</strong></p>
<p>Water is the most consumed fluid on earth.  Supply Great water in Plant based not Plastic Bottles. Allow students to earn money and assist us in our mission. Give back to Indigenous Canadian communities who lack clean, safe drinking water. What took so long to get here?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need <strong>$100,000</strong> to be in full production. We need your help! We have successfully obtained 5000 Plant Based Bottles made from corn and filled them with pure Canadian Spring Water-Great tasting , award winning and excellent to hydrate the human body; and we have consumers excited about our non plastic bottle.</li>
<li>There are in our research only a handful of companies in the world today on a mission such as ours and we are the only company in Canada trying to end plastic bottle pollution.</li>
<li>
<strong>Contribute $5000 </strong>and we will thank you with an original Native Canadian Soapstone Sculpture.<strong> Pledge $1000</strong> and we will send you a Lithograph (Limited Edition) drawn by an Indigenous Artist from Northern Canada. <strong>Provide $500</strong> and we will gratefully provide you with a case of 24 x 500 ml Plant Based<strong> <i>NIBIWATER</i></strong><i> </i>filled with our award winning pure pristine Canadian Spring Water once each month for 120 days.</li>

<h3>What will be great about a successful campaign?</h3>
<p>We don't have the funds to start up our bottling facility alone! A wonderful idea needs your help!</p>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> We have worked for the past full year to solve numerous problems in getting a 100%  Plant Based Bottle with Pure Canadian Spring Water to the consumer and now we are ready to ramp up production. </p>
<ul>
<li>The Big Multi-Nationals don't want us to succeed but we believe consumers will accept our offer with glee-Finally a non plastic container!  Compostable  too!</li>
<li>We will succeed. The world wants to consume pure water without polluting the planet.</li>
<li>Our price per bottle is accepted in the marketplace and the demographic we will reach welcomes such a Vegan Container. Not cardboard. Not Plastic. All Plant.</li>

Success would help Green the Planet!
Success would help students earn income while helping a noble cause!
Success would assist us in our commitment to donate pure water to Indigenous Communities.
Success would help the fight against having 100,000 marine mammals die every year from ingesting plastic in our oceans.


Risks & Challenges
 We have worked for the past full year to solve numerous problems in getting a 100%  Plant Based Bottle with Pure Canadian Spring Water to the consumer and now we are ready to ramp up production. 

The Big Multi-Nationals don't want us to succeed but we believe consumers will accept our offer with glee-Finally a non plastic container!  Compostable  too!
We will succeed. The world wants to consume pure water without polluting the planet.
Our price per bottle is accepted in the marketplace and the demographic we will reach welcomes such a Vegan Container. Not cardboard. Not Plastic. All Plant.

NIBI is the Ojibway word for water and we are indebted to the nations of people who first inhabited and still occupy the magnificent terrain of the Canadian Shield where our Pristine Spring Water filtered clean by nature bubbles up so we can capture it in our 100% Plant Based bottles, free of oil based plastic that contaminates the world we live in.

And for us, here in Jefferson, beer is the perfect way to do that! The Gist:Jefferson Beer Supply will be a brewery and sausage join located in Jefferson, South Dakota. We are proud of where we live and we want to celebrate it. Yup, warts and all. Or maybe corn and all. Corn warts and all…Anyway, beer! We take crafting our beer and sausages seriously so the drinking and eating part can stay fun! Hand brewed and sausaged in house, our elevated approach honors longstanding beer and sausage traditions, while paying homage to the ingredients and stories that make South Dakota awesome!Whether you are looking for a quick bite with your kids, a brewery tour of how beer is made, or a place to watch baseball with your friends, our family oriented space and menu will have something for everyone. We want to show off what makes Jefferson great! Our Strengths- Our Family!We are set up for success because our family has the drive, skill sets, passion, and organizational foresight to make this happen!Nicki, our director of brewing, has been brewing professionally for 6 years in Colorado, Wisconsin, and South Dakota. She got started brewing when she was hired to be a janitor at a startup craft brewery in 2014. Yup, the janitor/brewing crossover is real. She was a scholarship recipient through the Pink Boots Society, and studied beer and brewing in Bavaria, Germany. Her recipes have been distributed nationally and internationally. Beer and craftsmanship are her passion and she is looking forward to sharing them.Anthony is an experienced butcher and excited to bring his sausage making experience to Jefferson, as well as extend his other skills to various parts of the business. He actually got is start as a butcher working the meat counter at Jones' in Elk Point! He has since completed his butcher apprentice program and been honing his passion for butchering and sausage making professionally for the past 6 years. Born and raised in Jefferson, he is excited to grow this business in the place he calls home.If you’ve been to Jefferson, you probably already know Michaeleen. She has been the City Finance officer for the City of Jefferson for over 30 years. She keeps the city running, from managing the utilities like water and garbage to working on the budget, taxes, and infrastructure projects like the lagoon and the playground. She is a school bus driver, volunteer EMT, Days of 59’ coordinator, community center manager, and town’s busiest citizen. She has lived in Jefferson for over 40 years.Our Progress:Starting a brewery requires a lot of capital. We want to have what we need to start off right. We have our building in place and are working through renovations, but we still need some equipment and fixtures funded so we can get started making tasty beer! Money from this campaign will be used to pay for essential purchases, like our kegs, draft lines, sausage making equipment, furniture, tasting room renovations, and more. We have the experience to make this business great for the town of Jefferson, we just need the right tools to get the job done!

<p><strong>Multiculturalism is an attractive and persuasive notion. It suggests a human being whose identifications and loyalties transcend the boundaries of nationalism and whose commitments are pinned to a larger vision of the global community. That is exactly how I like to describe myself, along with being a ‘potential fulfiller’. I see the world as a place full of unlimited and untapped opportunities for learning.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As an immigrant and being part of the African Diaspora, I have realised that I would be a potent force for Cameroon’s development, my country of origin, not only by filling the inequality gap through remittances to member of my family, but also, most importantly, through promotion of trade, investments, research, innovation, and knowledge and technology transfers.</strong></p>

<p>After the scandal of child labor and modern slavery in 2000’s, the chocolate lobby convinced angry regulators that the industry could fix the child labor issue by 2005. Certifications, such as Fairtrade, UTZ, and Rainforest Alliance used to be perceived as great initiatives, but over the years they have become more of a marketing tool to bypass certain morals and put the consumer more at ease when in reality, over 20 years later, not much has changed.</p>

<p><strong>While global GDP has grown by 271% since 1990, the number of people living on less than $5/day has increased by more than 370 million.  Confronting inequality is the only way to end poverty in a climate-constrained world.</strong></p>
<p>Poverty-reduction rely on a fair distribution of our planet resources and not on the prospect of growth and at the expense of our planet.</p>
<p>Bantu Chocolate isn’t about the pursuit of endless industrial growth while chewing through our living planet and threatening our existence but instead Bantu Chocolate is about nurturing our nature.</p>
<p>By cultivating our own Cacao on a land passed down through generations, and producing a tasteful bean-to-bar chocolate, we want to wash away the persistent negative stereotypes surrounding West Africa Cacao and show that there are quality-conscious makers committed to ethically sourced, traceable and high-quality beans.</p>

<h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>In 2016 my mother decided to use the land she had inherited from her ancestors to start a farm in Cameroon. We not only planted cacao but opted for a <strong>regenerative agriculture </strong>approach and have also planted thousands of trees such as bananas, plantains, papaya, avocado, mangoes, shade and environmentally friendly trees to enhance biodiversity, protect and nourish soils.</p>

<div>No country can achieve sustainable economic development without substantial investment in human capital. Education enriches people's understanding of themselves and the world as a whole.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That is why at Bantu Chocolate, our farm is located in Cameroon, we make chocolate in London, and work hard to bring all the attention back to Cameroon and Africa as a whole by promoting children’s education and literacy in our village, creating employment opportunities as well as having a positive community impact by paying our collaborators a <strong>living wage.</strong> This will empower and support local members of the communities to solve their problems by themselves and help to fill in the gaps in basic health, education, income generation, and hygiene improvements.</div>

<p>The education sector is undeniably strategic to economic development.</p>
<p>That is why <strong>strengthening education </strong>for children will be one of our main focus areas along with paying our collaborators the living wage. The purpose of this specific project is to improve the quality of teaching and learning for teachers and children in our locality, with a focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement of school infrastructure, furniture and equipment. The school will receive financial support to build new classrooms, and procure library books and furniture. This will contribute to creating child-friendly, safe and conducive learning environments.</li>
<li>Raising awareness of the importance of good hygiene.</li>
<li>Strengthening of teachers’ skills - teachers will be trained on new teaching methods, usage of computers as teaching aids, and ways of promoting gender equality within the classrooms. They will also receive refresher training in their areas of teaching (i.e. Maths, English, French etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>By investing in job creating SME’s, like Bantu Chocolate, the aim is to create attractive post-education opportunities for young people, which can engender a virtuous cycle of progress in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h2>Ways you can help</h2>
<p><strong>We are looking for initial investment to raise £50K to support the creation of Bantu Chocolate and 5 tasteful chocolate bars recipes.</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618325701/ptxbzybycc1gncxkltwz.png"" src=""""/></p>

It suggests a human being whose identifications and loyalties transcend the boundaries of nationalism and whose commitments are pinned to a larger vision of the global community. That is exactly how I like to describe myself, along with being a ‘potential fulfiller’. I see the world as a place full of unlimited and untapped opportunities for learning.
As an immigrant and being part of the African Diaspora, I have realised that I would be a potent force for Cameroon’s development, my country of origin, not only by filling the inequality gap through remittances to member of my family, but also, most importantly, through promotion of trade, investments, research, innovation, and knowledge and technology transfers.
 

 
After the scandal of child labor and modern slavery in 2000’s, the chocolate lobby convinced angry regulators that the industry could fix the child labor issue by 2005. Certifications, such as Fairtrade, UTZ, and Rainforest Alliance used to be perceived as great initiatives, but over the years they have become more of a marketing tool to bypass certain morals and put the consumer more at ease when in reality, over 20 years later, not much has changed.
 


 
While global GDP has grown by 271% since 1990, the number of people living on less than $5/day has increased by more than 370 million.  Confronting inequality is the only way to end poverty in a climate-constrained world.
Poverty-reduction rely on a fair distribution of our planet resources and not on the prospect of growth and at the expense of our planet.
Bantu Chocolate isn’t about the pursuit of endless industrial growth while chewing through our living planet and threatening our existence but instead Bantu Chocolate is about nurturing our nature.
By cultivating our own Cacao on a land passed down through generations, and producing a tasteful bean-to-bar chocolate, we want to wash away the persistent negative stereotypes surrounding West Africa Cacao and show that there are quality-conscious makers committed to ethically sourced, traceable and high-quality beans.



 
 
Our mission
In 2016 my mother decided to use the land she had inherited from her ancestors to start a farm in Cameroon. We not only planted cacao but opted for a regenerative agriculture approach and have also planted thousands of trees such as bananas, plantains, papaya, avocado, mangoes, shade and environmentally friendly trees to enhance biodiversity, protect and nourish soils.




No country can achieve sustainable economic development without substantial investment in human capital. Education enriches people's understanding of themselves and the world as a whole.
 
That is why at Bantu Chocolate, our farm is located in Cameroon, we make chocolate in London, and work hard to bring all the attention back to Cameroon and Africa as a whole by promoting children’s education and literacy in our village, creating employment opportunities as well as having a positive community impact by paying our collaborators a living wage. This will empower and support local members of the communities to solve their problems by themselves and help to fill in the gaps in basic health, education, income generation, and hygiene improvements.
 


The Education Commission projects that if current trends continue, by 2030 just 4 out of 10 children of school age (1.4 billion children) in low- and middle-income countries will be on track to gain basic secondary-level skills.

 
The education sector is undeniably strategic to economic development.
That is why strengthening education for children will be one of our main focus areas along with paying our collaborators the living wage. The purpose of this specific project is to improve the quality of teaching and learning for teachers and children in our locality, with a focus on:

Improvement of school infrastructure, furniture and equipment. The school will receive financial support to build new classrooms, and procure library books and furniture. This will contribute to creating child-friendly, safe and conducive learning environments.
Raising awareness of the importance of good hygiene.
Strengthening of teachers’ skills - teachers will be trained on new teaching methods, usage of computers as teaching aids, and ways of promoting gender equality within the classrooms. They will also receive refresher training in their areas of teaching (i.e. Maths, English, French etc.)

By investing in job creating SME’s, like Bantu Chocolate, the aim is to create attractive post-education opportunities for young people, which can engender a virtuous cycle of progress in the future.
 
 

Ways you can help
We are looking for initial investment to raise £50K to support the creation of Bantu Chocolate and 5 tasteful chocolate bars recipes.

 


Then in a second phase the goal would be to expand into additional categories of food including honey and coffee trading to high ethical and sustainable standards on our farm.
The investment will allow us to implement a strong marketing support program of social media, press campaigns and strategic events, acquire a factory purchase equipment and pay our staff a fair living wage in Cameroon and London, where we are based, and where we will be producing our chocolate.
The investments breakdown is as follows: 
- 17% for Farming and Social Impact for the Village: planned to be paired with revenue from operations on the long term
- 21% for Chocolate Bean-to-Bar chocolate Making Equipment
- 15% for New Product Development: research, design, travel and chocolate line
- 26% for Marketing Programme: content productions, events, social media, paid social
- 21% for Personnel: Salaries and administrative costs.

Currently, we make over 20 flavors using beef, chicken, turkey, pork and duck, with more animal broth and flavors coming in 2021. We cook our bone broth over the course of 2 days to make sure we extract everything out of the bones. This gives us a nutrient and collagen rich broth. It is extremely flavorful and perfect to heat and sip, or to use to make a variety of dishes. It comes frozen so it can be stored safely in your freezer until you are ready to use it. We do ship throughout the country, however, being frozen has presented us with challenges. We ship overnight which is very costly outside of Oregon and Washington. To adjust and reduce cost we have worked on packaging that will extend the delivery time. Shipping smaller quantities at a low rate is still challenging, but we do have 12 packs in both pints and quarts available for shipping anywhere in the USA for a fraction of the normal cost.

However, we hope to raise more money to help with production needs as we move into our new facility. If you are someone that loves our products locally grab a gift card to save on your purchases throughout the year, or purchase as a gift for a friend. If you would like your gift card amount split between multiple cards simply pledge $2 more for each additional card after one. Use it as an opportunity to explore our many products including our sauces without refined sugar which will return Summer 2021. If you live outside of the PNW choose from one of our SOUPor Sauce or Bone Broth shipping options. Shipping options are available for a fraction of the normal shipping cost. For more info follow us on Instagram @NoMessChef and like us on acebook.com/nomesschef . With our move to our new facility and increased production we will be creating more content in 2021. Expect videos, recipes, interviews, collaborations and more! Questions? Please do not hesitate to ask. Thank you for your support!",20.0,3,"1 Campaign

From now on, you’ll never have to worry about your olive oil supply anymore. When your bottle is almost empty, the LED light changes from green to red and the chip sends a Bluetooth message to our mobile app, oLi. oLi asks if you’d like to order some more oil and then sends us a message if you do. Your order is then delivered in a sustainable refill pack that fits neatly through your letterbox, and, if you order before 17.00, your new oil will be on your doormat the following day.</p><h3>Swiss UV-glass</h3><p>Our smart bottle is made from Violettglass, a special type of light reflecting glass for a very good reason. Our friends at the engineering agency Miron in Switzerland did research into the behaviour of light in glass and it’s effect on the contents inside. They concluded that not all colours of the light spectrum cause fruit and veg to oxidise and, in fact, violet and infrared slow down the aging process. So Miron have helped us create a bottle that blocks all colours except these two. This special black glass means your oLivery oil stays perfect for up to six months. Just remember to screw the cap back on after.</p><h3>Refill pack</h3><p>At the moment, our refill pack is made from recyclable plastic – currently the best solution for sending olive oil by post. We’re working on two different possible solutions - plastic from recycled plastic and plastic from organic and compostable material (meaning you can recycle the packaging with all your other garden and kitchen waste). While both these packaging solutions are new for oil, they’ve been proven to work brilliantly with other food. So we’ve got a good feeling we’ll have a better solution in the not to distant future. We’re hoping to finish this project very soon but in the meantime, please recycle your refill pack with your other plastic waste.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537964766/saer2zrzzvltuvf7a1vm.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Why do we use plastic instead of glass? Well, plastic is far more energy efficient for a start. To make or even recycle glass, you need to heat it to very high temperatures which increases the carbon footprint. Glass is also impractical and heavy to transport. Our refill pack is light, needs very little material to protect what’s inside and can be delivered through regular post.</p><p>It’s far more efficient and environmentally friendly than parcel deliveries or buying your oil from the supermarket. So olive oil in the post is the way forward. We’ve also designed our refill pack so that you can squeeze every last drop of oil into your bottle. Zero waste, maximum taste.

I WANT TO RAISE MONEY FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS FOR THE ROCK AGAINST MS FOUNDATION - LET'S DO THIS AND MAKE AN IMPACT FOR THOSE THAT CAN'T!
Here is my story - I’m 33, have a degree in literature which has gone to little use outside of 
arguing about books. The last five years I've been designing and building commercial, film and TV sets… also started a design collective.
For the last two years I did a cross country motorcycle trip, attempted to climb 
mt. rainier (only made it to 13,500), kite boarding in the outer banks, burning 
man, rode my motorcycle through the biblical rains, ski, surf (horribly), fly 
fishing in Alaska, ran a tough mudder, and flipped my FJ40 
onto my arm.


Then I saw this adventure of crossing Siberia to the Arctic Circle on a vintage Russian motorcycle with a side care.... This adventure I cannot refuse and I decided to us it for good! I want to raise money for the Rock Against MS Foundation - My new friend Nancy Sayle started this to help people NOW - She has Primary Progressive and has a hard life daily but never says a word of complaint - This brings us to here, right now - IF I can get people to support my trek across Siberia I know I can make a difference to people that suffer this horrible disease!



Just think of the impact YOU will make for a person that lost their ability to walk or get up in the morning - Being trapped in a body that beats itself up daily is one I cannot conceive SO I lend my crazy adventures to those who can't and to those that need!

What We Need & What You Get
 Your donations will fund many cool things for this foundation to help those that need help NOW!
ROCK AGAINST MS FOUNDATION will provide services from a three (3) program resource system, which will provide daily care, quality of life needs and emergency funding, while assisting people with multiple sclerosis (MS) to live independent and full lives. Additionally, a brick and mortar facility we will call THE ROCK HOUSE is in the planning stages, and will provide free of charge, multiple programs and opportunities designed to heal the mind, body and spirit of all those whose lives have been affected by MS. 

You can get this really cool shirt!

OR and ALL-Star drum head signed by REALLY cool famous Rockstars!

I will ALSO do a shout out to you via my video when I arrive and when I return - While on the ice I will not be able to scream for help! I mean communicate with the real world BUT you will be able to follow me and my miles on a special link I will provide you!
Whether or not my goal is met it still goes into the program system to build and help people!   MORE info on my trip!

<p><strong>So we have to take the next big step and we need your support to get PINK to our first large scale production run, which is about 10k € (comparable to 10k US$). </strong></p>
<p>As you can imagine, as a small startup company we have to deal with big suppliers (ingredients and production equipment), which, you can imagine, is always a big challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Give us the opportunity to live our dream by funding us! And we invite each one of you to become part of our PINK and BLUE community and to create the next generation of healthy dinks with pure natural energy - together. We can achieve something special !</strong></p>
<p>If we reach more than the expected goal of 10k, you will also make the development of BLUE come through. Energy drink lovers around the world - be united and show your power.</p>

We're ready to go ! But, now we need your support !
We have spent countless hours in researching & developing these very special designed drinks and working hard with different food specialists, but finally we have something that we are very proud of ! We can’t wait for you to experience your first PINK and BLUE pure natural energy drink and tell all of your friends about it.
Now is the time that good enough isn´t enough, because when Quality and Passion meet something extraordinary is created.

With PINK the first drink development is already done and already paid by ourselves. We have tested the final taste with everyone we could find around us and the feedback was overwhelming. Now we are asked on a daily base, when the first drink is available - throughout the world !
So we have to take the next big step and we need your support to get PINK to our first large scale production run, which is about 10k € (comparable to 10k US$). 
As you can imagine, as a small startup company we have to deal with big suppliers (ingredients and production equipment), which, you can imagine, is always a big challenge.
Give us the opportunity to live our dream by funding us! And we invite each one of you to become part of our PINK and BLUE community and to create the next generation of healthy dinks with pure natural energy - together. We can achieve something special !
If we reach more than the expected goal of 10k, you will also make the development of BLUE come through. Energy drink lovers around the world - be united and show your power.

<h3>WHO WE ARE....</h3>
<p>Hi there! I'm Miranda Betts, Owner and Chef at Farm to Face.  For those of you who do not know Farm to Face, we are a seasonal staple and yearly fixture at the Baltimore Farmer's Market selling delectable, locally inspired falafel wraps, home made sauces and spreads, and inventive teas and juices.  For years, not just at the farmer's markets, but even at my home kitchen, I have been curious and inspired by the endless grandeur that our Mid-Atlantic growing region has to offer for ingredient selection and food choices. </p>
<p>Every morning of the farmer's market, we get to choose from an endless colorful pallet of veggies to include in our menu.  I do believe that the greatest excitement that we get from assembling our wraps is the surprise and awe we get from each and every one of you who come to frequent our stand. With daily quotes like, ""Oh my god! There's peaches on it!"" and, ""I'm so happy it's tomato season,"" are everything that drives us to continue with our growth.  There is one statement from the majority of you that we regularly get and we are finally acting upon...  ""When are you opening a restaurant?""</p>
<p>Well, here's the good news.  After years of searching and waiting for the perfect opportunity we have come across a beautiful location in Hamilton-Lauraville that will suit our needs and help us to be able to bring you exactly what you have been asking for, for years. By opening this little cafe we hope to bring you not just our wonderful falafel wraps, but also a new and rotating seasonal menu mainly derived from our partnerships with our local farmers in the area. </p>
<p>We are so excited and overjoyed to take this step. Primarily to expand on what we can offer to you in the form of a great local and seasonal menu. Your patronage over the years has been the main driving force for us and we hope that with your contribution we can find the means to purchase new equipment, install a hood for cooking, and to aid in the general start up costs for the restaurant.  We are so entirely grateful for your dedicated and consistant support to our concept now and over the years.</p>
<h3>What Our Needs Are and What You'll Gain</h3>
</div><div>
<p>In the past we have been extremely hesitant to take the next step in our growth primarily due to the costs that it takes to open up a brick an mortar.  It's intimidating, exciting, scary and fun! The time has come to take the leap and create something permanent that is enjoyable and highly desired for our community. This is where we will need your help. We have a laundry list of needs but can also operate with in a shoe string budget if we are unable to acquire our maximum amount of funding. Below is a list of both immediate and up coming needs required for us to be able to open up shop with in the next few months.  If we are unable to reach our entire goal we will use your contributions where they are needed most in order for us to open and operate. </p>
<ul>
<li>$10,000 permits, licenses, deposits</li>
<li>$10,000 security system, wifi, telephone, etc. </li>
<li>$30,000 for equipment (refridgerators, freezers, ovens, dish and glasswear, cash register, safe, juicers and blenders, tables, chairs, ETC.)</li>
<li>$5000 for the installation of a sit in bar top right by the kitchen</li>
<li>$20,000 installation of a small hood and range</li>
<li>$20,000 for a new falafel mobile, sadly our market vehicle is having some age related health issues. </li>
</ul>
<p>By contributing we'd like to offer some amazing perks for your belief in our growing project. We will have an amazing array of reusable cups for our signature juices and smoothies, t-shirts, catered events, and even cooking classes and demos for you and your friends. Please refer to the perks list for more thorough descriptions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Hope To Acheive....</h3>
<p>Once we are able to open up shop we are so entirely excited to bring to you the amazing vegetarian culinary delights that my crew and I have constantly been brainstorming about. We are always sharing ideas on what we can do to make it better, and what we would love to expand on in our menu. Falafel is not the only thing that we know how to make well.  We will offer wonderful vegetarian breakfast dishes, Homemade sauces and spreads, traditional favorites like lasagna, and gluten free and vegan options.  I'm really excited to integrate juices and smoothies with ingredients sourced from our local farmers. Our concepts and ideas are endless! We want our menu to be derived from the bounty that we get seasonally from our farmers here in the area and give your flavor palettes a chance to explore everything that we have at our finger tips. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I have stated before, it is so great to be moving forward.  With any project there are always obstacles that need to be overcome. I have a huge sense of pride in our resourcefulness whenever a challenge arises for us.  However, this new venture is an entirely different ball game. For example, I hope that we will be opening within the month but I also know from friends in the business that one month could turn into three.  We have a lot of support from our community and between that and our resourcefulness I am certain that we will be able to get through any challenge that we will face. </p>
<p>Farm to Face would not be Farm to Face with out all of the amazing people that I work with on a daily basis. Their support and input is what makes it so great. I really do believe that my crew is just as excited as I am for the new prospects of this permanent home for us. They are one of the driving forces for why we will succeed. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</h3><p>I’m Joaquín Torres, serial entrepreneur specialized in IT (information technology). I founded Diet Creator five years ago with the mission of simplifying the complex work of preparing quality nutrition plans using software that drastically reduces the hours of work of calculating and analyzing. Little by little our solution became known and many nutritionists began to use it.</p><p>Our society, more conscious every day of the intimate relationship that exists between food and health, demands solutions accessible to everyone. As fruit of this need we thought about how we could help many people – not just nutritionists – to benefit from our software’s capabilities. That’s how we came up with <strong>NutriLabel</strong>, which allows anyone to create balanced recipes, having the nutrition information presented on a label that can also be printed and affixed to any type of packaging, just like those on the products in supermarkets whose labeling was, until now, only in the reach of food companies.</p><h3>
<br/><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">FAQs</strong>
</h3><p><strong>Is NutriLabel software or a device?</strong><br/>NutriLabel is a solution that integrates Diet Creator nutrition software with Brother’s portable label printer. Nutrilabel is not a brand, it is a functionality of our Diet Creator software.</p><p><strong>What does this integration consist of?</strong><br/>It consists of the precise fitting of an SVG image of the standard label generated by the software – font type and size – to the size of the paper in the printer so that you only have to print without worrying about setup, cutting, etc.</p><p><strong>How does it work?​</strong><br/>You open the software on a computer, tablet or even on a smartphone to prepare the recipes or menus, and the nutrition information, the warnings of possible allergens and the properties of the foods are shown automatically. When you’re done, you just print the labels. You also have an advanced option that permits you to personalize the labels.</p><p><strong>Can I print the labels on any other printer?</strong><br/>Yes, but you will encounter a number of drawbacks, beginning with the fact that the printers are not designed specifically for labels, which will require you to configure the formats, look for special adhesive label paper and cut the labels by hand.</p><p>Other points to keep in mind are:</p><ol>
<li>The printer is portable and only weighs 2.56 lbs. (1.16 kg.), which allows you to move around freely with it and print anywhere.</li>
<li>Nutrition labels generally have a width of 2.3 in. (60 mm), so the width of the paper is key to not having to cut it to size with a paper cutter. The Brother label is 2.4 in. (62 mm) wide, perfect for simply printing and affixing at once.</li>
<li>The paper of the Brother printer <u>is waterproof so that the ink does not run, and it sticks to any surface</u>: cardboard, glass, plastic, etc.</li>
<li>The printer resolution is up to 300 dpi x 600 dpi, printing shop quality!</li>
<li>Brother prints 90 labels 3.2 x 2.3 in. (80 mm x 60 mm) per minute, a impressive speed for a portable printer that allows you to label as many containers as you can without wasting time because of the printing.</li>
<li>With one roll of paper you can make 360 labels 3.2 x 2.3 in. (80 mm x 60 mm).</li>
<li>The cost per label is only $0.04 for one color and $0,08 for two.</li>
</ol><p>In the end, any printer other than Brother would be more of a burden than a benefit for the job to be done. If you need to print thousands of labels for the same product, you can send the print file to your trusted printing shop to do the work.</p><p><strong>Can I use the software without having to buy the printer?<br/>​</strong>Of course. Diet Creator has one version for chefs and another for nutritionists that don’t include a printer, as seen in the summary of perks. The difference between the two versions is that with the version for nutritionists you can do anthropometric and physical development followups for people. Other than that the functions are the same.</p><p><strong>What differences are there between the two Brother printers offered?</strong><br/>The differences are that Model QL-820NWB, in addition to having Bluetooth which Model QL-810W does not, has a backlit LCD display with memory or function reader that allows the introduction of the date and time of printing, the previewing of different label templates that we’ve made and, with an external bar code reader, even identification of specific labels to be selected and printed without needing to confirm them visually on the display. These features can be useful if the printer is not connected to the software, which, at times, allows a certain independence. The manuals for the two models of printer included in the package are very clear about their features, in addition to which there are excellent video tutorials online.</p><p><strong>If I get any of the rewards, can I get any type of help if I need it?​</strong><br/>Of course. Our customer support team will hep you whether by e-mail or video call (Skype), if you ask for it. <strong> </strong></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Predictive calculation and easy label printing vs. laboratory and printing shop</strong></h3><p>Before NutriLabel, managing nutrition information and creating labels was very complicated and costly, as the services of a laboratory to analyze the foods had to be contracted, the design of labels commissioned and the labels taken to be printed. When the output is a small, hand-crafted or home-made, the traditional system isn’t an option given that the process described would have to be repeated for each product.</p><p>Thanks to the Diet Creator nutrition software, with NutriLabel you don’t have to send  the label for your products out anymore. Without leaving your desk you can do the whole process: instantly calculate the nutrition information and the percentage of the Daily Value (DV)*, and record the production and use-by dates.

This way you can adjust the calories, carbohydrates, proteins, salt or cholesterol, as well as the  level of vitamins and minerals. NutriLabel also allows you to know if something has an allergen that may be harmful to someone’s health.

NutriLabel not only detects allergens, but also the beneficial properties of your recipes
Foods can contain substances that cause adverse effects in some people, so-called food intolerance, and, more severe, food allergies. However, they can also have very positive health properties.

Eat healthily and safelyNutriLabel makes it possible for everyone to have access to the knowledge that nutrition information provides in order to improve their diet and that of those around them. Examples uses of NutriLabelWhen the family gets together to do the year’s canning, when we make dinner for our close family and friends, when we prepare dishes and smoothies that help us be in better shape to do sports.In addition, if you make dishes for your health food store, restaurant, or catering business, or if you sell pastry or prepared foods for others, you will finally be able to put a label with nutrition information on it as is required by law these days!
 
 NutriLabel is also a digital cookbook where you can create, change, save and share your recipes
 
You can copy your label’s link and paste in on your website or blog, as shown here

NutriLabel’s story
I’m Joaquín Torres, serial entrepreneur specialized in IT (information technology). I founded Diet Creator five years ago with the mission of simplifying the complex work of preparing quality nutrition plans using software that drastically reduces the hours of work of calculating and analyzing. Little by little our solution became known and many nutritionists began to use it.Our society, more conscious every day of the intimate relationship that exists between food and health, demands solutions accessible to everyone. As fruit of this need we thought about how we could help many people – not just nutritionists – to benefit from our software’s capabilities. That’s how we came up with NutriLabel, which allows anyone to create balanced recipes, having the nutrition information presented on a label that can also be printed and affixed to any type of packaging, just like those on the products in supermarkets whose labeling was, until now, only in the reach of food companies.
FAQs
Is NutriLabel software or a device?NutriLabel is a solution that integrates Diet Creator nutrition software with Brother’s portable label printer. Nutrilabel is not a brand, it is a functionality of our Diet Creator software.What does this integration consist of?It consists of the precise fitting of an SVG image of the standard label generated by the software – font type and size – to the size of the paper in the printer so that you only have to print without worrying about setup, cutting, etc.How does it work?​You open the software on a computer, tablet or even on a smartphone to prepare the recipes or menus, and the nutrition information, the warnings of possible allergens and the properties of the foods are shown automatically. When you’re done, you just print the labels. You also have an advanced option that permits you to personalize the labels.Can I print the labels on any other printer?Yes, but you will encounter a number of drawbacks, beginning with the fact that the printers are not designed specifically for labels, which will require you to configure the formats, look for special adhesive label paper and cut the labels by hand.Other points to keep in mind are:
The printer is portable and only weighs 2.56 lbs. (1.16 kg.), which allows you to move around freely with it and print anywhere.
Nutrition labels generally have a width of 2.3 in. (60 mm), so the width of the paper is key to not having to cut it to size with a paper cutter. The Brother label is 2.4 in. (62 mm) wide, perfect for simply printing and affixing at once.
The paper of the Brother printer is waterproof so that the ink does not run, and it sticks to any surface: cardboard, glass, plastic, etc.
The printer resolution is up to 300 dpi x 600 dpi, printing shop quality!
Brother prints 90 labels 3.2 x 2.3 in. (80 mm x 60 mm) per minute, a impressive speed for a portable printer that allows you to label as many containers as you can without wasting time because of the printing.
With one roll of paper you can make 360 labels 3.2 x 2.3 in. (80 mm x 60 mm).
The cost per label is only $0.04 for one color and $0,08 for two.
In the end, any printer other than Brother would be more of a burden than a benefit for the job to be done. If you need to print thousands of labels for the same product, you can send the print file to your trusted printing shop to do the work.Can I use the software without having to buy the printer?​Of course. Diet Creator has one version for chefs and another for nutritionists that don’t include a printer, as seen in the summary of perks. The difference between the two versions is that with the version for nutritionists you can do anthropometric and physical development followups for people. Other than that the functions are the same.What differences are there between the two Brother printers offered?The differences are that Model QL-820NWB, in addition to having Bluetooth which Model QL-810W does not, has a backlit LCD display with memory or function reader that allows the introduction of the date and time of printing, the previewing of different label templates that we’ve made and, with an external bar code reader, even identification of specific labels to be selected and printed without needing to confirm them visually on the display. These features can be useful if the printer is not connected to the software, which, at times, allows a certain independence. The manuals for the two models of printer included in the package are very clear about their features, in addition to which there are excellent video tutorials online.If I get any of the rewards, can I get any type of help if I need it?​Of course. Our customer support team will hep you whether by e-mail or video call (Skype), if you ask for it.   Predictive calculation and easy label printing vs. laboratory and printing shopBefore NutriLabel, managing nutrition information and creating labels was very complicated and costly, as the services of a laboratory to analyze the foods had to be contracted, the design of labels commissioned and the labels taken to be printed. When the output is a small, hand-crafted or home-made, the traditional system isn’t an option given that the process described would have to be repeated for each product.Thanks to the Diet Creator nutrition software, with NutriLabel you don’t have to send  the label for your products out anymore. Without leaving your desk you can do the whole process: instantly calculate the nutrition information and the percentage of the Daily Value (DV)*, and record the production and use-by dates. In addition, the software tells you – with warnings – of possible allergens that could affect people sensitive to them, so that the products don’t disagree with them. In this way you will meet the current regulations that require giving food information to consumers.* The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are <strong>Hinson Ford Cider &amp; Mead</strong>—<strong>Dave, Dennis and Mary. </strong>We have been making great ciders and meads for our own enjoyment for decades, and it’s finally time to go pro.</p>
<p>We began laying the groundwork for HFCM in 2016, and since then we’ve self-funded the build-out and furnishing of our production facility and tasting room, and we're proud to say we had a successful soft opening the last weekend in September.</p>
<p>We’re psyched about our ciders and meads finally being available to the public. There are still a thousand-and-one little details yet to attend to—most of which have impressive price tags, and we believe there's always room for improvement in what we have already done.</p>
<p>But our vision for Hinson Ford Cider &amp; Mead is not just about selling cider and mead. It’s about helping our neighbors--the apple growers and beekeepers of Rappahannock County--continue to do what they do in the face of increasing obstacles. If we can help maintain a strong market for apples and honey, that's good for the bees and that's good for all of us. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $60,000 in funding. This will allow us to do the following:</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If we do not reach our campaign goal, the list above reflects our priorities for the funding we do receive.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have been making great cider and mead for ourselves and for our loved ones since forever. We are cider and mead evangelists, making converts one tasting at a time. We are passionate about what we make, how we make it and what we make it from.</p>
<p>Yet there’s more to it than that. At one time, our community was a leading apple producer in the leading apple producing state in the country; we used to grow over 200 kinds of apples here; Queen Victoria extolled the virtues of Rappahannock County apples. Now we’re down to a handful of commercial orchards left, and they can’t make a living selling ‘Red Delicious’ a bag at a time over six weekends in the fall. We want to build a viable commercial market for unique apple varieties while they’re still around. Likewise, while we maintain our own apiary, we hope to build a vigorous market for local beekeepers to help encourage them to stick with it through fraught times. We all need the honeybees, and we all need the beekeepers that look after them for us. Mead helps monetize the value beekeepers provide on a scale greater than a bear-shaped squeeze bottle can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We face many potential challenges as we launch our business.</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, cider and mead are agricultural products, and depend on a reliable and predictable supply of apples and honey. A host of variables can affect the price, availability and quality of our raw materials. In 2017-2018, Virginia beekeepers lost about three of five hives, the greatest losses in state history and about twice the national average. So in addition to the fruit and honey we produce ourselves, we have supplier agreements with a number of local producers to ensure—to the greatest degree possible while remaining locally sourced—reliable access to top quality fruit and honey.</li>
<li>While we clearly view cider and mead as essentials, some people may not. Our success is coupled to an overall solid economy, and specifically to regional tourism drawing consumers from the nearby metropolitan areas (Washington. D.C., Richmond and Charlottesville, VA) to our rural community. An economic downturn would reduce this agritourism, as happened in 2008. However, we have recently discovered--much to our delight--an enthusiastic local community eager to enjoy and support the experience we provide.</li>
<li>The markets for both cider and mead are dynamic, experiencing dramatic rates of growth in recent years while other segments of the adult beverage industry are flat or dwindling. However, these rates of growth are spectacular in part because the starting point was so small—current information suggests there are about a thousand cideries and between three and four hundred meaderies in the U.S. Recently, the cider market suffered a small ‘flattening.’ But on closer examination, the ‘flattening’ was entirely at the expense of mass-market ciders, while craft ciders and nanocideries still experience strong growth.</li>
<li>Both cider and mead are gluten-free, and represent an alternative to grain-based beverages for GF consumers.</li>
<li>As seen with cider, the market for mead is experiencing strong growth in the U.S., with a new meadery opening somewhere every three days on average. The potential for continued growth in the mead segment is very strong, as meadmakers move beyond the stereotypical ‘<i>Four-S’</i> meads quaffed at your local RennFest: <i>Sweet, Strong, Still, Simple</i>.</li>
<li>The market for cider and mead is driven by the desire for a unique experience, and we must be keenly receptive and responsive to changing tastes in a fickle and discretionary marketplace.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are Hinson Ford Cider & Mead—Dave, Dennis and Mary. We have been making great ciders and meads for our own enjoyment for decades, and it’s finally time to go pro.
We began laying the groundwork for HFCM in 2016, and since then we’ve self-funded the build-out and furnishing of our production facility and tasting room, and we're proud to say we had a successful soft opening the last weekend in September.
We’re psyched about our ciders and meads finally being available to the public. There are still a thousand-and-one little details yet to attend to—most of which have impressive price tags, and we believe there's always room for improvement in what we have already done.
But our vision for Hinson Ford Cider & Mead is not just about selling cider and mead. It’s about helping our neighbors--the apple growers and beekeepers of Rappahannock County--continue to do what they do in the face of increasing obstacles. If we can help maintain a strong market for apples and honey, that's good for the bees and that's good for all of us. 

What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking $60,000 in funding. This will allow us to do the following:

Improve the build-out and equipping of our 3,600 sq. ft. production facility:
Onsite laboratory for raw material analysis and process/quality control
Product handling systems
Chiller system build-out
Bottling line build-out


Improve the build out of our Tasting Room:
Interior improvements and upgrades
Security/telecom/internet infrastructure
Visitor amenities
Draft system


Upgrade our exterior amenities:
Improve outdoor seating areas
Improve parking areas
Expand areas with pollinator-friendly plantings



If we do not reach our campaign goal, the list above reflects our priorities for the funding we do receive.

The Impact
We have been making great cider and mead for ourselves and for our loved ones since forever. We are cider and mead evangelists, making converts one tasting at a time. We are passionate about what we make, how we make it and what we make it from.
Yet there’s more to it than that. At one time, our community was a leading apple producer in the leading apple producing state in the country; we used to grow over 200 kinds of apples here; Queen Victoria extolled the virtues of Rappahannock County apples. Now we’re down to a handful of commercial orchards left, and they can’t make a living selling ‘Red Delicious’ a bag at a time over six weekends in the fall. We want to build a viable commercial market for unique apple varieties while they’re still around. Likewise, while we maintain our own apiary, we hope to build a vigorous market for local beekeepers to help encourage them to stick with it through fraught times. We all need the honeybees, and we all need the beekeepers that look after them for us. Mead helps monetize the value beekeepers provide on a scale greater than a bear-shaped squeeze bottle can.

Risks & Challenges
We face many potential challenges as we launch our business.

First and foremost, cider and mead are agricultural products, and depend on a reliable and predictable supply of apples and honey. A host of variables can affect the price, availability and quality of our raw materials. In 2017-2018, Virginia beekeepers lost about three of five hives, the greatest losses in state history and about twice the national average. So in addition to the fruit and honey we produce ourselves, we have supplier agreements with a number of local producers to ensure—to the greatest degree possible while remaining locally sourced—reliable access to top quality fruit and honey.
While we clearly view cider and mead as essentials, some people may not. Our success is coupled to an overall solid economy, and specifically to regional tourism drawing consumers from the nearby metropolitan areas (Washington. D.C., Richmond and Charlottesville, VA) to our rural community. An economic downturn would reduce this agritourism, as happened in 2008. However, we have recently discovered--much to our delight--an enthusiastic local community eager to enjoy and support the experience we provide.
The markets for both cider and mead are dynamic, experiencing dramatic rates of growth in recent years while other segments of the adult beverage industry are flat or dwindling. However, these rates of growth are spectacular in part because the starting point was so small—current information suggests there are about a thousand cideries and between three and four hundred meaderies in the U.S. Recently, the cider market suffered a small ‘flattening.’ But on closer examination, the ‘flattening’ was entirely at the expense of mass-market ciders, while craft ciders and nanocideries still experience strong growth.
Both cider and mead are gluten-free, and represent an alternative to grain-based beverages for GF consumers.
As seen with cider, the market for mead is experiencing strong growth in the U.S., with a new meadery opening somewhere every three days on average. The potential for continued growth in the mead segment is very strong, as meadmakers move beyond the stereotypical ‘Four-S’ meads quaffed at your local RennFest: Sweet, Strong, Still, Simple.
The market for cider and mead is driven by the desire for a unique experience, and we must be keenly receptive and responsive to changing tastes in a fickle and discretionary marketplace.

<p>We provide honey for some of the most recognisable brands in the UK, and are proud to be the first resident beekeepers at the Burghley House estate in over 100 years.</p>
<p><strong>We're no stranger to crowdfunding.</strong> Our two previous successful campaigns (one in collaboration with rappers <i>Too Many T's</i> for World Bee Day) helped us begin rearing and reintroducing the now rare native British honeybee, and prevent its' decline.</p>
<p>With a successful program now in place, our native honeybees, lovingly cared for here on our honey farm, have been producing <strong>100% British honey</strong> for almost two years. Our<i> Wild Countryside</i> honey has won a <strong>Great Taste award</strong> and true to our artisan ethics, we've been developing a very special product - British mead.</p>
<p>Consumers are drinking differently to how they have done in the past, as demonstrated by the boom in craft beer and gin sales, and with mead sales both in the UK and the US rapidly increasing (30% in the last 3 years**). With English Heritage stating they sell a bottle every 10 minutes**, now is the time to invest in bringing back this 4,000 year old delight.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Preserving the Past</strong></h2>
<p>Mead is one of the oldest drinks known to humans. In its most traditional form, a simple combination of honey and water allowed to ferment. For the Ancient Egyptians it was considered a <strong>drink of the Gods</strong>, but then commercial wine making took over and our ancestors began experimenting with other flavours and methods.</p>
<p>A complex product, mead can be still, sparkling, sweet, dry and even spiced - and by connoisseurs is considered, with its almost infinite variety of flavours and tones developed by the plants the bees forage on to make the honey, a much more superior product to wine.</p>
<p><u><i>DID YOU KNOW?</i></u> <i>Steeped in history, mead is believed to be the root for the word “honeymoon”. For centuries, on the eve of their marriage, the father of the bride would raise a glass of mead in celebration, making a toast to the newlywed couple. The toast continued every evening, at moonlight, for one month (an entire lunar cycle) following. Hence, “honeymoon”.</i></p>

<h2><strong>Achingly Artisan</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593613892/zvwmuqegehps03xwh1pb.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Everything about Bees &amp; Co. is focused on an artisan approach. We've been researching the history of mead and how our ancestors made it for many years.</p>
<p>Many of the very finest recipes were considered lost to time, now simply hearsay and legend. But then we stumbled across one part of a recipe considered to be one of the very finest ever made, which gave us a lead. Eventually, through cross-referencing several books, historical archives and interviewing retired beekeepers, we managed to piece together, bit by bit, the pieces of a remarkable puzzle. Our recipe is more than 100 years old, with very specific elements and conditions essential to its success. Sourcing the exact equipment and components required was a painstaking (and expensive) task.</p>
<h3><strong>Finally, our journey is almost complete...</strong></h3>
<p>We're turning once again to our trusted crowdfunding community to help us recreate this remarkable, traditional drink, produced to traditional artisanal standards. Where others have used honey in what is otherwise a sweet wine and sold it as ""mead"", or brewed to modern recipes, our <strong>Monastic Mead</strong> uses 100% British honey; only 2 other all-natural ingredients and a top secret process to achieve the delicate, soft, moorish flavour. </p>
<p>Using honey produced by our own native British bees and selected honey farmers in Britain, our plan is to produce both a still and sparkling mead with an ABV of around 14.5%, with a short brew (ready in around 6 months) and a matured, aged brew (matured for several years), bottled by hand into beautifully rustic glass 75cl bottles and sealed by dipping into beeswax. <strong>A product as beautiful to look at as it is to drink, celebrating British honey.</strong></p>
<p>Just like we did with kickstarting our native honeybee rearing program, we're inviting a group of you to come with us on this important next step of our latest journey, and celebrate and enjoy the very first batch of truly traditional, artisanal mead brewed to a recipe at least a century old.</p>
<p>We’re a small honey farm, and a family-run, independent business. Just as before, our crowdfunding target is invested directly into equipment, which includes very specific barrels for ageing and fermenting the mead found in only one place in the world; the production and careful sourcing of a very specific British floral honey; bottles and ancillary equipment and some support for marketing what we know is a unique product in the modern drink space. </p>
<p><strong>We’re excited at the prospect of being able to supply you delicious mead, with an achingly artisanal  backstory, for many years to come.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Ways You Can Get Involved</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Taste the Honey - £10</strong></h3>
<p>(Single estate honey is the secret to great mead. Grab a jar of the finest, raw, 100% British honey featuring a personalised label bearing your name. If alcohol isn’t your thing but you’d like to show your support for our ancestral values and help us preserve history, this perk is just for you)</p>
<h3>Sponsor A Queen Bee - £15</h3>
<p>(The right bees, producing the right type of honey, is just one of a series of very particular, critical components of an amazing mead. Sponsor one of our native queen bees, who head up our honey colonies, and receive an exclusive bee pin badge, adoption certificate and quarterly updates for the next 12 months on your queen)</p>
<h3>Reserve A Bottle - £25</h3>
<p>(Reserve your bottle, posted directly to your door. Bottled from the second batch, which is set to become our first retail batch)</p>
<h3>Reserve A First Batch Bottle (still) - £75</h3>
<p>(To celebrate, we’ll be filming the process of bottling the first 50 bottles. While they’ll absolutely be drinkable, we’d suggest keeping this for a special occasion, or as a potential investment piece. To commemorate the exclusivity of these first 50 bottles, we’ll add a personalised label featuring your name written by Master Beekeeper, Jez Rose, who heads up Bees &amp; Co. and is currently producing the mead by hand.</p>
<h3>Reserve A First Batch Bottle (sparkling) - £100</h3>
<p>(To celebrate, we’ll be filming the process of bottling the first 50 bottles. While they’ll absolutely be drinkable, we’d suggest keeping this for a special occasion, or as a potential investment piece. To commemorate the exclusivity of these first 50 bottles, we’ll add a personalised label featuring your name written by Master Beekeeper, Jez Rose, who heads up Bees &amp; Co. and is currently producing the mead by hand.</p>
<h3>Adopt A Cask - £250</h3>
<p>(The oak casks used to store and age the mead are such a particular type, size, age and origin, and so key to the beautiful taste, that their exact specification is a closely guarded secret. Adopt a cask and we’ll add an engraved plaque featuring your name, send you an adoption certificate; beautiful photos of your cask and an opportunity to visit to see your cask in action, along with a gift wrapped bottle of mead from our first batch.)</p>
<h3>Adopt An Apiary - £1,500</h3>
<p>(The bees are where it all begins, and this perk gives you the opportunity to adopt five hives, which will produce the honey used in our mead. Each hive will feature a special plaque bearing your name; you’ll receive an adoption certificate, quarterly updates of your hives and 5 bottles of mead from our first batch, each with personalised labels)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What if?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s always the risk when crowdfunding that others don’t quite love the idea as much as you do, and the target isn’t achieved.</p>
<p>In the event of that happening, we’ll still be continuing with our journey, just in much smaller steps because of the set up costs. Backers will still receive their mead but, as with our other crowdfunding projects, part of the joy for us is in sharing the journey - which is why we offer you the opportunity to get involved. </p>
<p>We've put together some FAQs, but if there's a particular question or concern you have, please do ask away.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What You’re Doing</strong></h2>
<p>Both of our previous crowdfunding campaigns were on the Indiegogo platform and successfully ended with perks delivered on time, achieving what we set out to achieve. In fact, <strong>its the native British bees from one of our previous campaigns that are now producing the beautiful, award-winning honey on the farm.</strong></p>
<p>So we’re back with this very different opportunity.</p>
<p>We are small, independent producers. At the very centre of our business is the beating heart of artisan methods and thinking. We care deeply and passionately about quality, seeking traditional methods that are true to the ancient craft of beekeeping and monastic meaderies.</p>
<p>The drinks industry, much like so many others, is dominated by large business; the art and craft - the attention to detail and the seekers of deeper knowledge - are largely lost. Careful consideration; a gentle and timely approach and a genuine passion can all be seen, felt and tasted in the end product of true artisans. Backing our campaign supports British farming; the British wildlife and environment; small business and perhaps most importantly of all, helps us preserve truly artisanal methods, and the delicious results.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Beekeeping is a seasonal activity and largely weather dependent. Without the right weather combination, the bees produce less surplus honey and there is, therefore, the risk that we may have to scale back our mead production.</p>
<p>However, we’re experienced and well-versed in our bees and their honey production, so we’ve developed a tight contingency plan, which involves both expanding our own bee stocks (more bee hives is a good safety net for producing more honey), and continuing to develop good relationships with other independent, bee farmers in Britain, who we can call on should we need to supplement honey stocks. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>COVID-19 has created a remarkably strange climate all over the world. On the farm we lost almost 90% of our income, which at this time of the year comes from people visiting for workshops and experience days.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we were still able to tend to our bees and the ‘time off’ provided us with the final weeks we needed to complete our research and put things into place to bring you this campaign.</p>
<p>We completely understand if you’re not able to contribute, but please do consider helping us by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sharing our campaign on social media (don't forget to tag us @ThatJezRose)</li>
<li>Emailing your friends, colleagues and family to let them know</li>
<li>Telling local businesses and press (newspapers, radio stations and magazines) to help us spread the word</li>

We’re excited at the prospect of being able to supply you delicious mead, with an achingly artisanal  backstory, for many years to come.
 
Ways You Can Get Involved
Taste the Honey - £10
(Single estate honey is the secret to great mead. Grab a jar of the finest, raw, 100% British honey featuring a personalised label bearing your name. If alcohol isn’t your thing but you’d like to show your support for our ancestral values and help us preserve history, this perk is just for you)
Sponsor A Queen Bee - £15
(The right bees, producing the right type of honey, is just one of a series of very particular, critical components of an amazing mead. Sponsor one of our native queen bees, who head up our honey colonies, and receive an exclusive bee pin badge, adoption certificate and quarterly updates for the next 12 months on your queen)
Reserve A Bottle - £25
(Reserve your bottle, posted directly to your door. Bottled from the second batch, which is set to become our first retail batch)
Reserve A First Batch Bottle (still) - £75
(To celebrate, we’ll be filming the process of bottling the first 50 bottles. While they’ll absolutely be drinkable, we’d suggest keeping this for a special occasion, or as a potential investment piece. To commemorate the exclusivity of these first 50 bottles, we’ll add a personalised label featuring your name written by Master Beekeeper, Jez Rose, who heads up Bees & Co. and is currently producing the mead by hand.
Reserve A First Batch Bottle (sparkling) - £100
(To celebrate, we’ll be filming the process of bottling the first 50 bottles. While they’ll absolutely be drinkable, we’d suggest keeping this for a special occasion, or as a potential investment piece. To commemorate the exclusivity of these first 50 bottles, we’ll add a personalised label featuring your name written by Master Beekeeper, Jez Rose, who heads up Bees & Co. and is currently producing the mead by hand.
Adopt A Cask - £250
(The oak casks used to store and age the mead are such a particular type, size, age and origin, and so key to the beautiful taste, that their exact specification is a closely guarded secret. Adopt a cask and we’ll add an engraved plaque featuring your name, send you an adoption certificate; beautiful photos of your cask and an opportunity to visit to see your cask in action, along with a gift wrapped bottle of mead from our first batch.)
Adopt An Apiary - £1,500
(The bees are where it all begins, and this perk gives you the opportunity to adopt five hives, which will produce the honey used in our mead. Each hive will feature a special plaque bearing your name; you’ll receive an adoption certificate, quarterly updates of your hives and 5 bottles of mead from our first batch, each with personalised labels)
 
What if?
There’s always the risk when crowdfunding that others don’t quite love the idea as much as you do, and the target isn’t achieved.
In the event of that happening, we’ll still be continuing with our journey, just in much smaller steps because of the set up costs. Backers will still receive their mead but, as with our other crowdfunding projects, part of the joy for us is in sharing the journey - which is why we offer you the opportunity to get involved. 
We've put together some FAQs, but if there's a particular question or concern you have, please do ask away.
 
What You’re Doing
Both of our previous crowdfunding campaigns were on the Indiegogo platform and successfully ended with perks delivered on time, achieving what we set out to achieve. In fact, its the native British bees from one of our previous campaigns that are now producing the beautiful, award-winning honey on the farm.
So we’re back with this very different opportunity.
We are small, independent producers. At the very centre of our business is the beating heart of artisan methods and thinking. We care deeply and passionately about quality, seeking traditional methods that are true to the ancient craft of beekeeping and monastic meaderies.
The drinks industry, much like so many others, is dominated by large business; the art and craft - the attention to detail and the seekers of deeper knowledge - are largely lost. Careful consideration; a gentle and timely approach and a genuine passion can all be seen, felt and tasted in the end product of true artisans. Backing our campaign supports British farming; the British wildlife and environment; small business and perhaps most importantly of all, helps us preserve truly artisanal methods, and the delicious results.
 
Risks & Challenges
Beekeeping is a seasonal activity and largely weather dependent. Without the right weather combination, the bees produce less surplus honey and there is, therefore, the risk that we may have to scale back our mead production.
However, we’re experienced and well-versed in our bees and their honey production, so we’ve developed a tight contingency plan, which involves both expanding our own bee stocks (more bee hives is a good safety net for producing more honey), and continuing to develop good relationships with other independent, bee farmers in Britain, who we can call on should we need to supplement honey stocks. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
COVID-19 has created a remarkably strange climate all over the world. On the farm we lost almost 90% of our income, which at this time of the year comes from people visiting for workshops and experience days.
Fortunately, we were still able to tend to our bees and the ‘time off’ provided us with the final weeks we needed to complete our research and put things into place to bring you this campaign.
We completely understand if you’re not able to contribute, but please do consider helping us by:

Sharing our campaign on social media (don't forget to tag us @ThatJezRose)
Emailing your friends, colleagues and family to let them know
Telling local businesses and press (newspapers, radio stations and magazines) to help us spread the word

<p>Hi! My name is Jennifer Utegg. I am currently working on a small business opportunity – a juice and smoothie shop - (The Juice Shop) to be located on Center Street in downtown Corry, PA!</p>
<p>For quite some time now, I have envisioned opening a space to the public that would not only help to nourish the physical body, but also the spiritual and mental. My goal is to offer organic fresh-pressed juices, smoothies, handcrafted organic coffees and teas, and herbal supplements,  as well as some whole-food, unprocessed food options in a calming, peaceful atmosphere. I believe we are called to be “restorers of the streets to dwell in” in our communities and I hope to do so with the opening of The Juice Shop. Our communities and our people need to find real connection, health, hope and peace. </p>
<p>I am now in the final phases of preparing to open my doors to the public, and that is where you can have an opportunity to sow into my endeavor either by  purchasing a prepaid “gift card” or by making a donation to get me to the finish line! With your support, I will be able to purchase a point of sale system, the supplies to adhere to the Covid-related requirements by the Health Department, and also the final licenses and legal fees. </p>
<p>With your investment, I hope to raise a minimum of $2500.00 for these purchases to get my business up and running in the next few weeks. With your help, we can make a positive contribution to the city of Corry and the surrounding communities!</p>

<h3>The Littlest Bake Shop</h3>
<p>The Littlest Bake Shop is a cupcake endeavor by baker, cookbook author and chef, Iris Green. As a gluten free vegan herself, Iris not only loves to bake compassionately crafted treats but also understands the importance of baking gluten free in a dedicated kitchen. </p>
<p>After months of collaborating on pop-ups with chef, Zaid C. S.  the pair has decided to make it a more permanent arrangement. Starting in May of 2019 645 E. 59th St. will open its doors again as a cupcakery and coffee shop featuring a variety of gluten free and vegan cupcakes alongside artisan crafted coffee and tea beverages. </p>
<p>In addition the pair will be hosting special gluten free and vegan dinner events and curating a Meatless Mondays with guest chefs.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552955688/ppfy93nhgjelt11vcvat.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As the space has already been in operation as a cafe and coffee shop the work that will need to be done to the space in order to open in May is minimal and will include design and rebranding the shop,  painting and decor, as well as new and expanded seating. </p>
<p>The space will require an addition of a commercial mixer and a professional convection oven, and additional power outlets run to accommodate the new demands. </p>
<p>Fortunately, we need only a little support from the community to truly make this space sing! </p>
<p>Your support can make the redesign and kitchen build out possible, helping to make a space for safe gluten free baking and the expansion of vegan accessibility in Kansas City. </p>
<p>In return we are offering incentives for those who are local and those supporters who are far away. We also have incentives for all levels of contribution ranging from signed cookbooks and thank you cards to getting to design and name your own cupcake that will be featured in the shop!</p>
<p>All incentives that include joining us for the opening night party are for you and a guest. Perks that include cupcakes are local pick up only. You can also choose to make a contribution without a perk. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Kansas City Metropolitan area presently offers no options for an exclusively gluten free and vegan bakery or eatery.</p>
<p>The Littlest Bake Shop, therefore, provides a much needed addition to the marketplace.</p>
<p>The Littlest Bake Shop is more than a cupcakery-- it is the opportunity for everyone from children to the young at heart, to enjoy the special feeling that a cupcake brings to every holiday, celebration or weekend, in spite of dietary restrictions either personal or medical.</p>
<p>According to the US Census Bureau, in 2017 Kansas City, Missouri had approximately half a million people. Celiac disease is considered the most prevalent disease in the Western Society with more than 1 in every 100 people having medical reasons to be gluten free.*  Additionally, many people avoid gluten due to inflammation, digestive needs, or personal choice.</p>
<p>*  American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute technical review on the diagnosis and management of celiac disease.</p>

</div></div>","The Littlest Bake Shop
The Littlest Bake Shop is a cupcake endeavor by baker, cookbook author and chef, Iris Green. As a gluten free vegan herself, Iris not only loves to bake compassionately crafted treats but also understands the importance of baking gluten free in a dedicated kitchen. 
After months of collaborating on pop-ups with chef, Zaid C. S.  the pair has decided to make it a more permanent arrangement. Starting in May of 2019 645 E. 59th St. will open its doors again as a cupcakery and coffee shop featuring a variety of gluten free and vegan cupcakes alongside artisan crafted coffee and tea beverages. 
In addition the pair will be hosting special gluten free and vegan dinner events and curating a Meatless Mondays with guest chefs.   


What We Need & What You Get
As the space has already been in operation as a cafe and coffee shop the work that will need to be done to the space in order to open in May is minimal and will include design and rebranding the shop,  painting and decor, as well as new and expanded seating. 
The space will require an addition of a commercial mixer and a professional convection oven, and additional power outlets run to accommodate the new demands. 
Fortunately, we need only a little support from the community to truly make this space sing! 
Your support can make the redesign and kitchen build out possible, helping to make a space for safe gluten free baking and the expansion of vegan accessibility in Kansas City. 
In return we are offering incentives for those who are local and those supporters who are far away. We also have incentives for all levels of contribution ranging from signed cookbooks and thank you cards to getting to design and name your own cupcake that will be featured in the shop!
All incentives that include joining us for the opening night party are for you and a guest. Perks that include cupcakes are local pick up only. You can also choose to make a contribution without a perk. 


The Impact
The Kansas City Metropolitan area presently offers no options for an exclusively gluten free and vegan bakery or eatery.
The Littlest Bake Shop, therefore, provides a much needed addition to the marketplace.
The Littlest Bake Shop is more than a cupcakery-- it is the opportunity for everyone from children to the young at heart, to enjoy the special feeling that a cupcake brings to every holiday, celebration or weekend, in spite of dietary restrictions either personal or medical.
According to the US Census Bureau, in 2017 Kansas City, Missouri had approximately half a million people. Celiac disease is considered the most prevalent disease in the Western Society with more than 1 in every 100 people having medical reasons to be gluten free.*  Additionally, many people avoid gluten due to inflammation, digestive needs, or personal choice.
*  American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute technical review on the diagnosis and management of celiac disease.

<h3>Embracing Community Through Tea</h3>
<p>After what seems a lifetime of experiences in the hospitality industry, and a lesser time in legal, and agriculture, and earning my MFA in Fiction and Creative Nonfiction, my passions and dreams have remained the same. Yes, I love to write, but more than anything I wanted a life in Tea.  I love tea, I love the experience, the texture and the depth.  Tea embraces us with a familiarity. We have a history of tea. It has been woven into our 'fabric of life' - our DNA -  so to speak, through the centuries. And, the deeper I go into Tea, the more I am grateful for the experiences of my life, not just the many years in hospitality, but also those years in Agriculture and in Law Offices. The combination of the three has definitely helped me over the hurdles one finds in any business, including Tea.  I have a very deep understanding of farming practices, organics, etc, and my experience in law helps with about any venture.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Susan Nunn. Although my love of tea goes back to my childhood, the idea of tea as a business, that of Thunder Mountain Tea, grew from my blending tea at the big dining room table at the guest ranch I managed years ago in Arizona. After years of nurturing that idea, it has now grown into where I am today.  Nothing happens overnight, at least not in my world. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521482946/dmiokubnakrldcoztqgv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Blending my own teas seemed to be a natural extension of my love for cooking and my love for people. I feel tea brings a sense of belonging to everyone who partakes in a cup of tea, not only with our familes, friends and neighbors, but also it can give us a deep connection to those who have passed before us. Tea has been shared across centuries and now I want to expand on this and share tea across our country, our world.  Yes, tea was meant to be shared. Having a business is great, but at the same time, there is a need for a deeper sense of purpose. My heart leads me to want to reach out to others, share these delicious loose-leaf teas with people who may not have even given 'the comfort of tea' a thought. And, in the process, dispel the myths that shroud the 'art of tea.'</p>
<p><i><strong>Embracing Community Through Tea</strong></i>.  With all the discord and chaos in our country I feel the need to share some 'calmness' in some way.  I've been asking myself for months, how could I, being just one person and one small company, make a difference in this world? </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521406050/zjhk5mnkpclbdvvmnv0a.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At one point, I decided to get a new perspective on all of this, as you can tell in my yoga picture. That, and being in nature always brings me into my center. </p>
<p>I've been donating tea to different events that tugged at my heartstrings, and giving to people who just need a bit of kindness shown to them, but I wanted to reach out to others in our communities across the country, others I would never be able to reach on my own. </p>
<p>You see I believe tea to be universal, it crosses cultures, and weaves us all together into community. I also believe that building strong bonds in our neighborhoods and communities is where the strength of our Nation lies. I've always been a 'giver' and for months I played around with this idea, as everything around us has been spiraling into chaos, all I wanted to do was bring a smile to someone's face, letting them know someone cares.  </p>
<p>And, so it began. I started by 'gifting' a bag of delicious loose-leaf tea to each of my customers who spent $30 or more.  All I asked them to do was 'gift' that extra bag of tea to another.  Maybe a family member or friend who was having a bad day - or maybe a neighbor to whom they have never spoken, a work mate, just anyone they wanted to give something to, something that would bring some joy into another's life. It has truly been a success!  The recipients of these 'gifts' have been so overwhelmed with gratitude, and those who receive the 'gift bag' in with their orders are very grateful, and even before it arrives, they say they already know who they will give it to. </p>
<p>Some businesses just want to build a customer list, but for me it is about building a 'caring community.' As you can tell with the Rewards Program I have set up, I am calling the donors Ambassadors. I send tea for their own use, and then 'gift' them bags of teas to 'gift' to others. 'Ambassador' is a perfect word, trusting others to carry the torch forward, to catapult this Initiative into Orbit.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAwRaVmdtN4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Can you help me?  Please donate what you can, and I will send you the teas you sign up for, and please forward this project out to your social communities.  Let's see how far we can spread this.  I have made the commitment to do this for a minimum of one year, and then we will re-evaluate it and see where it can go next.  I know we can 'rock with compassion' and the teas and the 'gift of giving' will make us all a tighter knit community. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>With the launch of this project, no longer will this be an 'I' project, it will instantly become a 'We' project. There is a proverb -  'It takes a village to raise a child,' and it also 'takes a village' to boost any 'caring' idea into orbit.</p>
<p>I have been working with advertisers and some different packaging companies, and looking at shipping costs (which I will share the cost) to see what my fundraising goal should be for this campaign. One thing for sure, the tea that is gifted will have a label all their own and the tea will always remain of the highest standards.  All 'gifted' teas will be the very same teas I ship to tea lovers on a daily basis.  I waited to make sure this project was catching hold, and now after 'gifting' teas for the past few months, and seeing that it is an idea that people really are getting excited about, I am now designing the new labels for these.</p>
<p>I am asking for you all to kick in and help me.  This is the first funding request to catapult this project into orbit!  After we deem this project a success, then we may launch a second in the fall with a different objective, that of reaching more specific groups of our population.</p>
<p>Amount needed to fund this project:  $10,000.00  Below are only estimates as the costs will change with the amount of response we get. </p>
<ol>
<li>Advertising and printed material - $4500</li>
<li>Labels (Designing and printing) - $1500</li>
<li>Products, Packaging, personnel, misc. - $4000</li>
</ol>
<p>What I will do to move this forward:  Being a writer is helpful in times like this.  I will set up talks about the project and will write articles about it, sharing as far and wide as I can get it, submitting to magazines, newspapers, and many online as well. We will develop a strong presence on all aspects of Social Media. And, I will advertise in different magazines and am looking into NPR.</p>
<h3><strong>What is in it for you?  </strong></h3>
<p>I have some exciting perks, especially if you are a tea lover, and a lover of peace and strength in our communities.  Such as, beautiful Tea Presses, both small and large, Teapots, Tea Cozies and tea wallets, and, of course, delicious teas delivered to your home and bags of these same delicious teas to 'gift' to others.     </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521149295/oj3irrfvu7qw8vq5d4ad.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the project will continue at a slower pace, but it will continue. I am committed to this for at least one full year. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I understand that asking the donors to 'gift' the teas I send them is asking them to do something more so than their financial gift.  I admit this is unusual for these platforms, but I have a purpose in designing this in this way.  In order to spread goodwill, each of us has to take responsibility to get the 'gifted' teas out to others. That is the only way it will work. These delicious teas, which we know can help center us and give us a connection, combined with the spreading of goodwill which will 'lift' the people we reach out to, will, in the process, help build strong and caring communities across our nation. </p>
<p>This past year, I have worked the Capital City Public Market in downtown Boise every Saturday.  What I discovered is:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521403997/lqhs3brw0c9j15vpi5nr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li> Although there are many people who were thrilled to have loose leaf tea and to taste all the different teas, there are many who have never tried them.  They are extremely curious about the loose leaf teas, and would probably love them, but are intimidated - thinking they need a whole different knowledge base before they can try them.</li>
<li>From college kids to the elderly, many say they don't have extra income for such, thinking loose leaf tea is a luxury, but would love to try them.</li>
<li>People from all walks of life flock to the tea booth for samples. They are surprised at the wonderful and earthy blends Thunder Mountain Tea is becoming known for.</li>
<li>Tea builds community.  It is a powerful tool for our fractured society.  It is joyful to just watch the people of different cultures, the different age groups, all gathered and laughing and discussing the different teas.  </li>
<li>There are lots of tea companies out there in this world.  Each has their own business plan, their own vision - and I have mine. After years of managing hotels, lodges and guest ranches, and a lot of years in kitchens, I came to realize  that most don't serve the best teas.  I spend hours at a time sourcing the best teas and botanicals at the best prices, and I move those prices forward to the consumers. </li>
<li>By contributing, you will become a 'Tea Ambassador for Goodwill' and as you 'gift' the teas I 'gift' to you to others who may be struggling or to a neighbor you have never spoken to, or a friend who's having a bad day, you will reap the rewards of 'giving' and making someone a little happier.  Tea, as I have said, is universal, and it can be the 'thread' that brings our communities across the country together. As if we needed a reason to speak to others - the tea is reason enough.</li>
<li>Those who receive the teas will know that someone cares.  This is huge.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>As I stated above, I have a lifetime of experiences in hospitality, agriculture and the legal field.  I have coordinated large conferences in remote settings (which means one has to be very organized) and have hosted several workshops and retreats. Taking care of people is what I have always done.  I love tea, and I have two wonderful employees to help me with this project. </p>
</div><div>
<p>I feel I have in some way mastered the blending of teas.  I say in some way as I don't believe there will ever be a time when i am not learning more each day, but, I feel I have a good understanding of the business, and of the teas, and I have two good employees, so I don't foresee too many obstacles in this year-long project. After several years of being in the tea business, my supply chain appears to be in good working order.  My way has always been - if I run into an obstacle, I just find a way around it. I never let things upset me, knowing I can work my way through any challenge.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div><p>I want you all to know how much I appreciate you.  If you can't contribute funds, don't worry about it.  You would be doing this Initiative a huge service by just sharing this on your social media and getting it out, further and further into the social media macrocosm.  Using the Indiegogo share tools works beautifully.  Thank you and wishing you peace, Susan</p></div></div>","Embracing Community Through Tea

There are lots of tea companies out there in this world.  Each has their own business plan, their own vision - and I have mine. After years of managing hotels, lodges and guest ranches, and a lot of years in kitchens, I came to realize  that most don't serve the best teas.  I spend hours at a time sourcing the best teas and botanicals at the best prices, and I move those prices forward to the consumers. 
By contributing, you will become a 'Tea Ambassador for Goodwill' and as you 'gift' the teas I 'gift' to you to others who may be struggling or to a neighbor you have never spoken to, or a friend who's having a bad day, you will reap the rewards of 'giving' and making someone a little happier.  Tea, as I have said, is universal, and it can be the 'thread' that brings our communities across the country together. As if we needed a reason to speak to others - the tea is reason enough.
Those who receive the teas will know that someone cares.  This is huge.

Challenges
As I stated above, I have a lifetime of experiences in hospitality, agriculture and the legal field.  I have coordinated large conferences in remote settings (which means one has to be very organized) and have hosted several workshops and retreats. Taking care of people is what I have always done.  I love tea, and I have two wonderful employees to help me with this project. 

I feel I have in some way mastered the blending of teas.  I say in some way as I don't believe there will ever be a time when i am not learning more each day, but, I feel I have a good understanding of the business, and of the teas, and I have two good employees, so I don't foresee too many obstacles in this year-long project. After several years of being in the tea business, my supply chain appears to be in good working order.  My way has always been - if I run into an obstacle, I just find a way around it. I never let things upset me, knowing I can work my way through any challenge.
Other Ways You Can Help
I want you all to know how much I appreciate you.  If you can't contribute funds, don't worry about it.  You would be doing this Initiative a huge service by just sharing this on your social media and getting it out, further and further into the social media macrocosm.  Using the Indiegogo share tools works beautifully.  Thank you and wishing you peace, Susan",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

It aims at taking balsamic vinegar to a whole new level. As a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CFzR9bWF0Q6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">female vinegar maker</a> from Modena, Italy (the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CGSLgKmFK2G/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">land of balsamic</a>), my goal is to make the world of balsamic vinegar a little more female-friendly and also to spread knowledge about a still underrated and misunderstood product.</p><p>I honor the century-old tradition as I grow and hand-harvest the grapes myself from my estate vineyard, and I follow the traditional process passed on to me by my ancestors. <i>Martina's vinegar </i>is about continuing this tradition by growing my family production into a <strong>structured business </strong>as one of the <strong>few female entrepreneurs</strong> in the field, and do this in an innovative way to change the way people see and use balsamic vinegar: my goal is to spread a <strong>new understanding</strong> around this legendary product and make people see its real value thanks to the experience it can provide. </p><p>The journey started around 1940, when my family set up the first barrels. According to family records, the vinegar that we now have has aged in wood barrels for over <strong>50 years</strong>. This vinegar is a piece of  history that I want to share with you. ​</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Why Modena on the Entire Planet</strong></h3><p>The original balsamic is exclusively produced in Modena. The <strong>moist and humid</strong> weather, the winds, the soil give a very special taste to the grape juice. The <strong>huge temperature excursion </strong>between summer and winter that characterizes the area allow for a unique aging process. And only a <strong>few indigenous grape</strong> <strong>varieties</strong> are good for balsamic vinegar. All things <strong>you cannot replicate anywhere else</strong>.  If you add to all this the secret ingredient of <strong>time</strong>, with the vinegar that ages for decades in different woods, you’ll see why this is a <strong>unique culinary world heritage.</strong></p><p> </p><h3><strong>A Treasure from Ancestors, a 50-year aged Vinegar</strong></h3><p>Since I was a little <strong>girl</strong>, I used to see my family make<strong> </strong>balsamic vinegar at home, continuing the tradition started by my great-grandparents at the beginning of <strong>1900</strong>, boiling down the grape must in <strong>a bonfire in the fresh September air</strong> and let it age in our vinegar loft with care, passion and dedication, for decades. The vinegar that we have <strong>today</strong> is the result of this <strong>miracle: </strong>it<strong> </strong>has aged for over <strong>50 years. </strong>Decades of <strong>patiently waiting </strong>for a unique product. The long aging process in wood barrels added over time a completely unexpected feature to this vinegar. </p><p> </p><h3><strong>My Dream </strong></h3><p>This project is about growing as female vinegar maker to give<strong> continuity</strong> to a long tradition, as well as to <strong>educate</strong> people about the way in which, we, Italians from Modena, see and <strong>experience</strong> balsamic vinegar. Let me explain. </p><p><strong>1. The Ultimate Food Luxury</strong>. Balsamic vinegar is everything but salad dressing. My goal is to make people see this because this opens up to endless experiences. My balsamic vinegar is rich, <strong>smooth, with a syrupy texture,</strong> deep brown in color, and has a complex flavor that balances the natural sweet and sour elements of the cooked grape juice with hints of wood. It has a <strong>lively acidity </strong>combined with <strong>rounded sweetness</strong>. All flavors are exceptionally concentrated. </p><p>It allows for simple but impressive food pairings, as well as easy and fancy drinks, cocktails and <i>classy shrubs</i>. It pairs perfectly with <i>meat, cheeses, </i>and <i>fried food.</i> It is also delicious with<i> risotto, or fish, ice-cream </i>and<i> fruit</i>. <strong>Most people do not know </strong>that you can easily make sophisticated dishes or drinks with some drops of balsamic and share them with family, friends and neighbors to truly <strong>impress</strong> them and give them an unprecedented palatal experience.</p><p><strong>2. Conceiving Time Differently Teaches you how to Appreciate Life More</strong>. Balsamic vinegar is not just food, it is part of a sophisticated and meditative lifestyle made of quality time, family, friends and love. It is integral part of the <strong>Italian way of life</strong>. Traditionally, <strong>when a child is born, </strong>grandparents used to give the child a series of barrels to the grandchild. In this way, the vinegar ages as the child grows and this is an incredible way to <strong>transcend time.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Balsamic Vinegar as Asset Class</strong>. Balsamic Vinegar is, and increasingly will be, an asset class. It is not yet as obvious as wine, but there are a few factors that show why it is so:</p><ul>
<li>It is <strong>scarce in supply</strong>. Supply is also tightly controlled and also really impossible to replicate anywhere else in the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>High prices</strong> have been paid in auctions (up to $95,000/gallon) and prices are on the rise despite the moment of crisis.</li>
<li>
<strong>Authenticity </strong>can be ascertained and verified.</li>
<li>Its quality and <strong>value increases over time</strong> and do not degrade (it allows for the type of stable and improving quality an appreciating asset requires). </li>
<li>It is not any more difficult to understand than wine, maybe <strong>easier to understand.</strong>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>4. An Endangered Tradition. </strong>There aren’t many young producers, and definitely very <strong>very few female balsamic vinegar makers. </strong>Most people that now produce balsamic vinegar here in the area of Modena are over 70 or 80. And women are almost non-existent in this industry. I do not want this century-old tradition to go lost with newer generations, but mostly I want to assert the value of women's work in an area of entrepreneurship, such as agriculture and food, where women are still underrepresented. </p><p> </p><h3><strong>I Need your Help</strong></h3><p>My goal is to save my production, grow, and improve processes to turn this into a real business. With the funds from your donations, I would like to:</p><ul>
<li>Repair my ancient barrels. Some barrels are almost<strong> a century old</strong>. Some were originally used for liqueurs or beer <strong>brought by WWII soldiers</strong> and they were washed and cleaned so that they could be used for balsamic vinegar aging. Some others are more recent, and I need support to continue production.</li>
<li>Buy new barrels to increase production, add <strong>additional and special productions</strong>, as well as new equipment to improve processes.</li>
<li>As a young and female producer, I need support in spreading this innovative concept of a product that originates from a long tradition but that is also <strong>modern, cool, sophisticated </strong>and moves with the times.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3><p>Martina's Vinegar is a limited edition balsamic vinegar. Elegant bottles, <strong>individually numbered and dated,</strong> contain a special vinegar obtained from cooked and fermented grape must aged in oak, cherry, juniper wood barrels. Every year <strong>I only bottle 10% of my whole production, </strong>to give continuity to the aging process. </p><p>As a sign of gratitude, this year I want to share it with you. With my personal reserve <strong>I<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CIF_PY4q7fg/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> can only create 30 boxes</a>.</strong> I have created 2 types of boxes that you can choose from:</p><p><strong><i>Luxury Box: </i></strong></p><ul><li>2 bottles of vinegar (100ml/3.38 fl oz each) aged <strong><i><u>15 years</u></i></strong>, in barrels that are almost a century old. </li></ul><p><strong><i>Dream box:</i></strong></p><ul>
<li>One bottle of vinegar (100ml/3.38 fl oz) aged <strong><i><u>15 years</u></i></strong>. </li>
<li>One bottle of vinegar (100ml/3.38 fl oz) aged over <i><u><strong>30 years</strong></u></i>. </li>
</ul><p>All vinegar is aged in barrels that are almost a century old. </p><p>In addition to the 2 bottles of vinegar, <strong>both <i>Luxury </i>and <i>Dream</i> boxes also include: </strong></p><ul>

As a female vinegar maker from Modena, Italy (the land of balsamic), my goal is to make the world of balsamic vinegar a little more female-friendly and also to spread knowledge about a still underrated and misunderstood product.I honor the century-old tradition as I grow and hand-harvest the grapes myself from my estate vineyard, and I follow the traditional process passed on to me by my ancestors. Martina's vinegar is about continuing this tradition by growing my family production into a structured business as one of the few female entrepreneurs in the field, and do this in an innovative way to change the way people see and use balsamic vinegar: my goal is to spread a new understanding around this legendary product and make people see its real value thanks to the experience it can provide. The journey started around 1940, when my family set up the first barrels. According to family records, the vinegar that we now have has aged in wood barrels for over 50 years. This vinegar is a piece of  history that I want to share with you. ​ Why Modena on the Entire PlanetThe original balsamic is exclusively produced in Modena. The moist and humid weather, the winds, the soil give a very special taste to the grape juice. The huge temperature excursion between summer and winter that characterizes the area allow for a unique aging process. And only a few indigenous grape varieties are good for balsamic vinegar. All things you cannot replicate anywhere else.  If you add to all this the secret ingredient of time, with the vinegar that ages for decades in different woods, you’ll see why this is a unique culinary world heritage. A Treasure from Ancestors, a 50-year aged VinegarSince I was a little girl, I used to see my family make balsamic vinegar at home, continuing the tradition started by my great-grandparents at the beginning of 1900, boiling down the grape must in a bonfire in the fresh September air and let it age in our vinegar loft with care, passion and dedication, for decades. The vinegar that we have today is the result of this miracle: it has aged for over 50 years. Decades of patiently waiting for a unique product. The long aging process in wood barrels added over time a completely unexpected feature to this vinegar.  My Dream This project is about growing as female vinegar maker to give continuity to a long tradition, as well as to educate people about the way in which, we, Italians from Modena, see and experience balsamic vinegar. Let me explain. 1. The Ultimate Food Luxury. Balsamic vinegar is everything but salad dressing. My goal is to make people see this because this opens up to endless experiences. My balsamic vinegar is rich, smooth, with a syrupy texture, deep brown in color, and has a complex flavor that balances the natural sweet and sour elements of the cooked grape juice with hints of wood. It has a lively acidity combined with rounded sweetness. All flavors are exceptionally concentrated. It allows for simple but impressive food pairings, as well as easy and fancy drinks, cocktails and classy shrubs. It pairs perfectly with meat, cheeses, and fried food. It is also delicious with risotto, or fish, ice-cream and fruit. Most people do not know that you can easily make sophisticated dishes or drinks with some drops of balsamic and share them with family, friends and neighbors to truly impress them and give them an unprecedented palatal experience.2. Conceiving Time Differently Teaches you how to Appreciate Life More. Balsamic vinegar is not just food, it is part of a sophisticated and meditative lifestyle made of quality time, family, friends and love. It is integral part of the Italian way of life. Traditionally, when a child is born, grandparents used to give the child a series of barrels to the grandchild. In this way, the vinegar ages as the child grows and this is an incredible way to transcend time.3. Balsamic Vinegar as Asset Class. Balsamic Vinegar is, and increasingly will be, an asset class. It is not yet as obvious as wine, but there are a few factors that show why it is so:
It is scarce in supply. Supply is also tightly controlled and also really impossible to replicate anywhere else in the world.

High prices have been paid in auctions (up to $95,000/gallon) and prices are on the rise despite the moment of crisis.

Authenticity can be ascertained and verified.
Its quality and value increases over time and do not degrade (it allows for the type of stable and improving quality an appreciating asset requires). 
It is not any more difficult to understand than wine, maybe easier to understand.

4. An Endangered Tradition. There aren’t many young producers, and definitely very very few female balsamic vinegar makers. Most people that now produce balsamic vinegar here in the area of Modena are over 70 or 80. And women are almost non-existent in this industry. I do not want this century-old tradition to go lost with newer generations, but mostly I want to assert the value of women's work in an area of entrepreneurship, such as agriculture and food, where women are still underrepresented.  I Need your HelpMy goal is to save my production, grow, and improve processes to turn this into a real business. With the funds from your donations, I would like to:
Repair my ancient barrels. Some barrels are almost a century old. Some were originally used for liqueurs or beer brought by WWII soldiers and they were washed and cleaned so that they could be used for balsamic vinegar aging. Some others are more recent, and I need support to continue production.
Buy new barrels to increase production, add additional and special productions, as well as new equipment to improve processes.
As a young and female producer, I need support in spreading this innovative concept of a product that originates from a long tradition but that is also modern, cool, sophisticated and moves with the times.
 What You GetMartina's Vinegar is a limited edition balsamic vinegar. Elegant bottles, individually numbered and dated, contain a special vinegar obtained from cooked and fermented grape must aged in oak, cherry, juniper wood barrels. Every year I only bottle 10% of my whole production, to give continuity to the aging process. As a sign of gratitude, this year I want to share it with you. With my personal reserve I can only create 30 boxes. I have created 2 types of boxes that you can choose from:Luxury Box: 2 bottles of vinegar (100ml/3.38 fl oz each) aged 15 years, in barrels that are almost a century old. Dream box:
One bottle of vinegar (100ml/3.38 fl oz) aged 15 years. 
One bottle of vinegar (100ml/3.38 fl oz) aged over 30 years. 
All vinegar is aged in barrels that are almost a century old. In addition to the 2 bottles of vinegar, both Luxury and Dream boxes also include: 
Vinegar tasting kit that includes a pipette and the traditional ceramic spoon
Access to food pairing suggestions, as well as drinks and elegant shrubs with instruction on how to make them at home
Discounted prices on purchased quantities for the next 5 years!
 Packaging is hand-made in Italy. The boxes are crafted individually by expert Italian tailor hands.Additionally, I have created other perks as a thank you for your help.  Finally, as an add-on, you can get the Vinegar Tasting online course. The course covers:
Play with your senses and discover new sensations
Learn the basics of balsamic vinegar making
Assess authenticity: differentiate between good and less good balsamic vinegar
Play with food and drinks to create unique tasting experiences for family and friends
Learn to properly invest in balsamic vinegar as asset class.
