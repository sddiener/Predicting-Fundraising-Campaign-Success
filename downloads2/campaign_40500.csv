<p>We, Hilary and Stephen Scharper, are professors at the University of Toronto who both love and value trees.

Without informing us, our neighbor unilaterally obtained a permit to destroy the tree.</p>
<p>We hired certified arborists who established that the Maple was healthy and should not be destroyed. We offered to pay entirely for maintaining the tree, but our neighbor refused. Instead she sued us, claiming full ownership of the tree with the intention to fell it. We hired celebrated enviromental and civl rights lawyer Clayton Ruby to defend us and won our case at Ontario Superior Court. </p>
<p>This is a landmark case for tree preservation. </p>
<p>Until this ruling, the typical practice was for one neighbor to unilaterally cut down a shared tree and deal with the ""fall-out"" later.  </p>
<p>This ruling puts a stop to such practices. It puts legal ""teeth"" into the protection of our urban forest and beloved backyard trees.</p>
<p>It is the first time that the Ontario Forestry Act has been applied in an urban context. As reported on the front page of the June 19th Globe and Mail, this ruling can potentially save thousands of trees from arbitrary destruction. Thanks to this case, it is now a criminal act if one neighbor injures or cuts down a shared tree without the co-consent of their neighbor. Failure to do so can result in a $20,000 fine or jail time.</p>
<p>Our neighbor, however, is preparing to appeal this decision. The appeal process could lead to the reversal of this landmark ruling.</p>
<p>Thus far, we have spent thousands of dollars of our own money in legal fees, and now need to raise $40,000 to respond to the appeal and defend this ruling.</p>
<p>We ask you to help us by making a donation (no amount is too small!) and/or sharing this campaign with your networks.</p>

My name is Mohamed Yousry . I am a Mechatronics engineer. i grew up in  Cairo  where breathing air for one day =smoking 20 cigarettes . i always censured my parents generation for ruining our situation and letting air that polluted.
but i Realized that i must stop blaming and start to change the future , because we can't reverse what happened in Egypt. 
so i decided with a Group of engineers to make a positive change.  i believe with your help We can change how the story ends. 


Waste mismanagement is one of the major causes of air pollution in Cairo, citizens burning trash everywhere because there is no other way to get rid of it. This video shows exactly our situation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYfyFnEPnIQ&amp... 


We are a group of Egyptian engineers decided to start collecting the trash and recycle it, we will video record every area (before and after) cleaning , to inspire people to start recycling and save their lives .







The incident that inspired me to take an action :
i decided to fight air pollution in Cairo, when mother of my dearest friend died young from lung cancer ( she never smoked a cigarette) , once i saw how much  he and his family suffered , and found it's our wrong attitude, all of us that killed her ,     i felt guilty and will never forgive myself until i change the attitude of burning trash  and i will .
With helping us You will give thousands of people the chance to breathe clean air ,  you can save many of humans, animals and plants from dying by air pollution.

Every change in Egypt’s air affects the whole earth (we aim to a positive change in earth for earth and all the living creatures, starting from here, EGYPT)



That's how beaches are in Egypt





Our schools and streets



Where does my contribution go?

Waste Plastic Recycling Machine = $10,000 , to recycle the trash and prevent burning it
Special clothes and masks for collecting trash = Est. $250
Leasing space for the equipment (one year) = $3400
 Indiegogo.com charges a 4.0% fee for funds you raise + 5% PayPal taking for transferring = 1350 $


your contribution will make a positive change in our fight against air pollution and climate change , And it will decrease the suffering and death of all creatures.

why we choose our goal to be 15,000$ ?
15,000$ is the lowest amount to start the recycling movement , we believe the change was never about money its about idea , about believing to make a change .

-what is the impact of breathe free project on the world ? 

Our project is going to change air quality of Cairo , where Cairo is one of the most polluted cities in the world , every positive change of its air quality affects all the world and will affect positively those two sad facts :                                      


 7 million person die every year all over the world by air pollution, where also millions of birds, animals and plants suffer to death .                                                         
Climate change is the most threatening disaster to all the creatures on earth , it is going to end the lives of all human beings .



""we are the first generation to feel the impacts of climate change and  the Last generation can do anything about it ""  


Many creatures extincted through the whole history , because they haven't the knowledge and couldn't communicate with each others to unite for ending the disaster threatening them to extinction.
The Effect of climate change on Earth :

Sea levels have risen between four and eight inches in the past 100 years. Current projections suggest that sea levels could continue to rise between 4 inches and 36 inches over the next 100 years.


approximately 100 million people live within three feet of sea level. Sea level rise associated with climate change could displace tens of millions of people in low-lying areas – especially in developing countries.


                        

Climate change threatens one-fourth of the Earth's species to be headed for extinction by 2050 .


               



Climate change brings health risks to the world's most vulnerable communities.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that climate change may have caused more than 150,000 deaths in the year 2000 alone, with an increase in deaths likely in the future.


Rising temperatures and changing patterns of rain and snow are forcing trees and plants around the world to move toward polar regions and up mountain slopes.


Climate change will cause storms, hurricanes and tropical storms to become more intense.





Scientific research indicates that climate change will cause hurricanes and tropical storms to become more intense — lasting longer, unleashing stronger winds, and causing more damage to coastal ecosystems and communities .




Scientists point to higher ocean temperatures as the main culprit, since hurricanes and tropical storms get their energy from warm water. As sea surface temperatures rise, developing storms will contain more energy.

<li>Saving bees</li>
</ul>
<p>By being one of the main pollinating insects, bees play a key role in the reproduction of many plants including fruit and seeds plants.

<p>This bee farm provides a great opportunity to engage young people from the community in an environment-friendly project by sharing bee faming knowledge via basic trainings and workshops.

Saving bees

By being one of the main pollinating insects, bees play a key role in the reproduction of many plants including fruit and seeds plants. Unfortunately bee colonies have been globally declining over the past few years mostly because of pesticide overuse, pollution, global warming and resistant parasites. Responsible beekeeping helps to increase the bee population and contribute to a more sustainable eco-system in the area. 

Providing healthy food

Besides being sweet and tasty, honey is a good antibacterial and antioxidant product. It also contains fructose which is a natural energy booster. Bees produce honey but, as mentioned previously, they are also essential to local crops such as mangos, ackees, apples, jack fruits, etc. They are therefore a precious partner to local agriculture.

Sharing knowledge with youth

This bee farm provides a great opportunity to engage young people from the community in an environment-friendly project by sharing bee faming knowledge via basic trainings and workshops. Hopefully, bee farming skills will be augmented and youth employment enhanced in an area that suffers from a lack of employment opportunities.

Positive Impact on the community

Through this crowdfunding project, I hope to raise awareness of the farm’s existence and invite people from all horizons to come and visit us. This initiative will create an avenue of friendship between people from both Jamaica and other countries, and the citizens of Kingston 12.
On the path to achieve this project, several unfortunate events have slowed its development. Some of the terrible experiences which I had to overcome include:

The impact of the current drought, which has been trashing Jamaica’s southern regions, in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy on October 24, 2012.

Although these obstacles were hindering this journey, I was still able to hurdle them all. I can proudly declare that I have exhibited the competence to protect and defend my assets against all challenges. I am therefore qualified, poised and ready to take the next step to ensure greater productivity.


To develop the bee farm to an excess of three hundred colonies within the next three years.

To launch a workshop for the youth of the community.

To replace gears which disappeared in the fire.

To rear new colonies at six different locations across the northern region of Jamaica where there’s adequate rainfall.

To produce and extract a minimum of 500 gallons of honey annually.

To produce a minimum of 500 pounds of bees wax annually.

To harvest bee pollen for distribution as a health food commodity.

The rearing of queen bees for the export market.

To complete erection of the perimeter fence which is now under construction.
To purchase a second hand vehicle for the transportation of the farm's products.









By your kind contributions a Kingston 12 bee farm will expand, the ecology of our communities will improve, basic training in bee farming skills will be augmented and youth employment enhanced.
Together, we will be saving bees and making the community sweeter! Many thanks and « nuff » respect to all the people who contribute to worthy causes such as this!

In June of 2016 I will be traveling, with a small team from Pittsburgh to a village called El Huizachal in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to work with Dr. Luis Hurtado and local Pamé farmers to continue the design and planting of a network of forest gardens. We began these plantings in 2015 and have been asked to come back and continue the process. Forest gardening uses the natural forest ecosystem as guide to grow fruit, nut, vegetable and even fiber and animal crops. This year our team will include permaculture instructor and farmer Darrell Frey, author of Bioshelter Market Garden, Jessy Swisher from Pennsylvania Association of Sustainable Agriculture, as well as skilled team members from Garfield Community Farm. 


Food Forests are diverse, multilayered food production systems that maximize potential harvests and environmental benefits while minimizing labor inputs. A food forest or forest garden can provide food for many decades while improving soil conditions and increasing biodiversity and habitat. Food forests are also one of the most traditional and ancient forms of indigenous agriculture, and so we are learning from Pame of central Mexico while assisting them in creating new food forests in their fields.

In 2014 The Open Door Presbyterian Church sent my family to further our partnership with Luis Hurtado and the work he is doing as a doctor with the Pamé.  The Pamé people have been an oppressed and often impoverished people. We believe their food security and future well-being lies with their own talented farmers and not the multinational companies that  bring processed foods from the big cities. We've learned that many of the villagers are ready and willing to learn new and ancient ways of doing ecological farming that will better their land and allow for a more diverse and nutritious diet. 
In 2014 and later in 2015 we brought our experience of running a three acre urban farm in Pittsburgh and my work as a permaculture designer to teach ideas of food security, forest garden design and communal-self sufficiency. We helped plant three gardens in the village, planted dozens of fruit trees, and also planted ideas that have taken root over the last twelve months. 
Our efforts over this two week planting project will include fruit and nut tree selection, planting and education for the villagers. Some of the species will include guava, guanabana, mango, avocado, strawberry tree, tamarind, papaya and more! 
   What We Need To complete this work in a short amount of time we hope to raise $10,000.
- $5000.00 Travel, Housing, Food for Team of Ten for Two Weeks
- $1000.00 First Year Trees, Shrubs and Tools
- $2000.00 Water Catchment Systems for Three Garden Installs 
- $2000.00 Funds for Future Installations with Additional Pamé Farmers
    The Impact Over the past eight years The Open Door Church has been developing three acres of abandoned urban property into a diverse vegetable and fruit producing landscape. We have also been building relationships and teaching sustainable agriculture in El Huizechal, Mexico for about six years. Our work in 2016 will focus on fruit and nut tree care, planting of new species and replanting of those species showing the most promise.

<p> </p>
<p><em><span class=""notranslate"">THANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT<br/></span></em></p>
<p><em><strong><br/><br/></strong></em><strong>FULL DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>Could it really be true that there is such a thing as an all-magnet motor that can provide rotational torque for useful energy generation, with no apparent input other than what nature provides through principles of magnetism not yet fully understood? Modern science emphatically says ""NO"", but many inventors over the years have claimed to have defied that prediction, by building working motors.<br/><br/> Now, at the upcoming 41st International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva from April 10-14, 2013, the world may have a chance to see such a motor.<br/><br/> The Turkish patent office has <a href=""http://pureenergyblog.com/2013/02/26/turkish-patent-institute-invites-yildiz-to-geneva-inventions-conference/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">invited</a> inventor Muammer Yildiz, to whom they awarded such a patent, to display his all-magnet motor at that expo; and he has invited me to participate in that event.</p>
<p>As many of you who follow our Free Energy News know, I've been closely tracking the Yildiz all-magnet motor for the past few months, both in keeping a <a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Event:2013:Validating_Muammer_Yildiz%27_Magnet_Motor_for_30_Days_at_European_University"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> about it at PESWiki updated, as well as in helping to facilitate things through my interactions with the various players, including the inventor; his assistant, Halil Turkmen; the documentary film maker, Rene van der Woude of <a href=""http://www.mixr.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mixr.nl</a>; Dr. Jorge Duarte of Eindhoven University, who has been vouching for this technology; and a guy, who for now prefers to remain anonymous, from another university who is helping to coordinate the scientific validation; among others involved in coordinating this.<br/><br/> We all, especially the inventor, are anxious to finally see this technology class vindicated once and for all, to never be doubted again.<br/><br/> This would be the beginning of a new scientific and energy revolution -- a paradigm crasher, an eye opener, and the opening of a new path forward in providing clean solutions to the world's energy problems.<br/><br/> With all the interactions I have had on this, many of them confidential, I am very certain about the reality of Mr. Yildiz's motor design being real. <br/><br/> And I'm crossing my fingers that the technology will be able to get at least a minimal level of validation at the Geneva expo.<br/><br/> Most of the people I mentioned above have been probing around on this, and have a significant list of reasons why they are confident that the technology works.<br/><br/> What we can do, versus what will actually be displayed, has been the topic of much discussion behind the scenes, taking a wide range of variables into consideration, including politics of science, noise levels in the expo hall, safety issues, electronic magnetic memory erasing issues, feasibility of a scientifically credible environment for validation, possible alternate locations for moving the unit from the hall to a secondary location, feasibility of moving the set-up.<br/><br/> One of the limiting factors is that though the motors work, they have been built on a low budget and don't always have the best possible components, such as the bearings needed to withstand the forces generated. Though well advanced from the duct tape and bailing wire stage of prototyping, they are not ready for full-on stress testing.<br/><br/> While he is on this trip, following the Geneva expo, Mr. Yildiz wants to take the motor(s) to a university for proper scientific testing, and he doesn't want to jeopardize their operation by trying to show off too much at the expo. Nor does he want to risk the chance of a malfunction during a public display. So he is playing it very cautious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In terms of capability, being very conservative, we could show one motor running the whole time, turning an alternator to power a 1000 Watt bank of lights. <br/><br/> What such a demonstration needs to prove is that for the size of the motor, there isn't anything in today's known scientific literature that could be concealed inside the motor that could possibly keep it running for as long as it is shown to be able to run.<br/><br/> The skeptics have been assuming that Mr. Yildiz has some kind of energy storage inside the motor cavity, by which he can show the shaft turning, but that he has not shown it running for long enough to rule out a hidden energy storage mechanism.</p>
<p>For the size of the motor, the most likely energy storage would be lithium ion batteries. And if the motor body was full of lithium ion batteries, the amount of power it could produce would be 1700 watt-hours. So in order to fully satisfy the skeptics, the demonstration of Yildiz' motor needs to be for at least long enough to surpass that amount of power; and most of them would want to see ten times that much before being fully convinced. So two hours of running continuously, producing 1000 Watts, would do the trick of showing at least as much power as any lithium-ion batteries packed inside the body could provide.<br/><br/> A likely iteration will be the fan blade that Yildiz usually uses to demonstrate the technology. That motor body will be 14 cm in diameter and about 21 cm long, and the fan is 25 cm in diameter. At the speed he runs it, that load is around 380 Watts. So to at least match the lithium-ion battery scenario, he would need to run it for 4.5 hours. And if it was still running at full speed at the end of that time, most skeptics would be scratching their heads, though not fully satisfied.  But after 45 hours, they would have to admit there is something to this.<br/><br/> The expo hall will be open for 9 hours each day, so even if we were only able to do the fan, running the entire time, each day, that would be 2x what present technology is capable of providing.<br/><br/> I've been pushing hard to have a secondary location where we could enable continuous running of at least one motor for the entire 5-day event.<br/><br/> Yildiz says that the longest he has ever run a motor without stopping was fifteen days, with witnesses. But he needs witnesses willing to go on record, with credentials.<br/><br/> In Geneva, in addition to the university personnel who plan to come, we can also have others sign in and sign out, with their signature and credentials, to add to the list of witnesses of the technology running continuously. And by having a tag-team type of pass-off by always having someone else take over where they left off, a net duration can be established, with many overlapping witnesses throughout.<br/><br/><strong>Open Source?<br/></strong><br/> Another reason I would like to attend the Geneva expo will be to meet in person with Mr. Yildiz and talk through the possibility of having an open license for people to be able to pursue lower power versions of the design without an up-front license, with the stipulation that they remit a royalty on all commercial roll-outs. He has been very favorable so far in these discussions. My being there in person would be particularly important in seeing this to fruition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BUDGET:</strong><br/><br/> $1,547.00 - Flight [Actual: 1,041.90, from booking earlier]) <br/>$1,333.00 - Hotel for 9 days<br/> $500 - Food<br/> $100 - Transportation<br/> $200 - Misc. buffer<br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$184 - Fundraiser fee</span></p>
<p>$3864 - Total<br/><br/>Adjusted to raise: $3087 (We can't change total after campaign starts, so Sterling paid $777 into the fundrasier on March 25, to get it back once the campaign is funded, or refunded if the campaign doesn't meet the goal by at least 80%)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PROJECT GOALS:</strong></p>
<p>Enable Sterling to attend the Geneva Inventors expo, to help Mr. Yildiz with his demonstration of the magnet motor technology. Enable Sterling to personally witness a working all-magnet motor for the first time, with proof of its validity, along with anyone else who wishes to observe online or attend the expo. Enable Sterling to discuss terms with Mr. Yildiz of open sourcing. Enable Sterling to speak at a press conference to be held announcing the accomplishment. Prove to the world that a new, clean energy modality has arrived, launching a new scientific and economic revolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PROJECT MILESTONES:</strong></p>
<p>- Arrive in Geneva<br/> - Help set up demo, with a possible secondary location<br/> - Help collect witness signatures<br/> - Help interface between universities and Yildiz to meet validation requirements<br/> - Surpass the minimum duration to rule out hidden storage capacity<br/> - Surpass that by many times<br/> - Establish terms for open license<br/> - Demo much higher output capability for short durations<br/> - Post plans for open license of lower output versions (e.g. &lt; 5 kW)<br/> - Press conference announcing success and ramifications</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES:</strong></p>
<p><br/> - Mr. Yildiz could be stopped in his transport across international borders, despite having documentation from the Turkish patent office stating the purpose for the round trip.<br/>- The motor(s) could be damaged during transport to the event.<br/> - Mr. Yildiz could encounter problems assembling the system.<br/> - The Expo venue may have rules (noise, safety) that disallow continuous operation of the motor.<br/> - Webcams could malfunction, interrupting continuous observation by Internet audience.<br/> - Mr. Yildiz may opt out of a secondary location because he wants to be present.<br/> - Mr. Yildiz could opt to not demo the technology for a sufficient period of time.<br/> - Mr. Yildiz could cancel the demo and only display the hardware.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong> FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Q. If you don't raise the amount needed for the trip, what happens to the funds?<br/> A.</strong> The pledge is not collected if the goal is not met by at least 80%.<br/><br/><strong>Q. If the 25-cm fan is attached and run at the usual speed (producing a 380 Watt load), how long will the motor need to run to rule out a hidden storage capacity?<br/> A.</strong> 4.5 hours.<br/><br/><strong>Q. If the same motor is attached to a 1000-Watt load (e.g. bank of lights) via an alternator, how long will the motor need to run to rule out a hidden storage capacity?<br/> A.</strong> 102 minutes.<br/><br/><strong>Q. How are you calculating the storage capacity?<br/> A.</strong> One reader pointed out that: ""According to Wikipedia, Li-Ion batteries can have a volumetric power density of 1900 J/cm3. With the given dimensions of 14 cm diameter x 21L, the motor body can contain approx. 3200 cm3 * 1900J = 6139 kJ of energy if it was packed with Li-Ion batteries.  If the batteries fully discharge in 24 hrs, the power output would be about 71Watts on average."" That comes to 1704 Watt-hours.<br/><br/><strong>Q. Where can we watch the streamed version of the demo?<br/> A.</strong> The streaming location will be announced at PESWiki.com, among other places.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How much does it cost to attend the Expo?<br/>A.</strong> Media gets in free. The admittance fee for the general public is CHF 14/day with no previous registration.</p>

THANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT
FULL DESCRIPTION:
Could it really be true that there is such a thing as an all-magnet motor that can provide rotational torque for useful energy generation, with no apparent input other than what nature provides through principles of magnetism not yet fully understood? Modern science emphatically says ""NO"", but many inventors over the years have claimed to have defied that prediction, by building working motors. Now, at the upcoming 41st International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva from April 10-14, 2013, the world may have a chance to see such a motor. The Turkish patent office has invited inventor Muammer Yildiz, to whom they awarded such a patent, to display his all-magnet motor at that expo; and he has invited me to participate in that event.
As many of you who follow our Free Energy News know, I've been closely tracking the Yildiz all-magnet motor for the past few months, both in keeping a blog about it at PESWiki updated, as well as in helping to facilitate things through my interactions with the various players, including the inventor; his assistant, Halil Turkmen; the documentary film maker, Rene van der Woude of http://www.mixr.nl; Dr. Jorge Duarte of Eindhoven University, who has been vouching for this technology; and a guy, who for now prefers to remain anonymous, from another university who is helping to coordinate the scientific validation; among others involved in coordinating this. We all, especially the inventor, are anxious to finally see this technology class vindicated once and for all, to never be doubted again. This would be the beginning of a new scientific and energy revolution -- a paradigm crasher, an eye opener, and the opening of a new path forward in providing clean solutions to the world's energy problems. With all the interactions I have had on this, many of them confidential, I am very certain about the reality of Mr. Yildiz's motor design being real.  And I'm crossing my fingers that the technology will be able to get at least a minimal level of validation at the Geneva expo. Most of the people I mentioned above have been probing around on this, and have a significant list of reasons why they are confident that the technology works. What we can do, versus what will actually be displayed, has been the topic of much discussion behind the scenes, taking a wide range of variables into consideration, including politics of science, noise levels in the expo hall, safety issues, electronic magnetic memory erasing issues, feasibility of a scientifically credible environment for validation, possible alternate locations for moving the unit from the hall to a secondary location, feasibility of moving the set-up. One of the limiting factors is that though the motors work, they have been built on a low budget and don't always have the best possible components, such as the bearings needed to withstand the forces generated. Though well advanced from the duct tape and bailing wire stage of prototyping, they are not ready for full-on stress testing. While he is on this trip, following the Geneva expo, Mr. Yildiz wants to take the motor(s) to a university for proper scientific testing, and he doesn't want to jeopardize their operation by trying to show off too much at the expo. Nor does he want to risk the chance of a malfunction during a public display. So he is playing it very cautious.
 
In terms of capability, being very conservative, we could show one motor running the whole time, turning an alternator to power a 1000 Watt bank of lights.  What such a demonstration needs to prove is that for the size of the motor, there isn't anything in today's known scientific literature that could be concealed inside the motor that could possibly keep it running for as long as it is shown to be able to run. The skeptics have been assuming that Mr. Yildiz has some kind of energy storage inside the motor cavity, by which he can show the shaft turning, but that he has not shown it running for long enough to rule out a hidden energy storage mechanism.
For the size of the motor, the most likely energy storage would be lithium ion batteries. And if the motor body was full of lithium ion batteries, the amount of power it could produce would be 1700 watt-hours. So in order to fully satisfy the skeptics, the demonstration of Yildiz' motor needs to be for at least long enough to surpass that amount of power; and most of them would want to see ten times that much before being fully convinced. So two hours of running continuously, producing 1000 Watts, would do the trick of showing at least as much power as any lithium-ion batteries packed inside the body could provide. A likely iteration will be the fan blade that Yildiz usually uses to demonstrate the technology. That motor body will be 14 cm in diameter and about 21 cm long, and the fan is 25 cm in diameter. At the speed he runs it, that load is around 380 Watts. So to at least match the lithium-ion battery scenario, he would need to run it for 4.5 hours. And if it was still running at full speed at the end of that time, most skeptics would be scratching their heads, though not fully satisfied.  But after 45 hours, they would have to admit there is something to this. The expo hall will be open for 9 hours each day, so even if we were only able to do the fan, running the entire time, each day, that would be 2x what present technology is capable of providing. I've been pushing hard to have a secondary location where we could enable continuous running of at least one motor for the entire 5-day event. Yildiz says that the longest he has ever run a motor without stopping was fifteen days, with witnesses. But he needs witnesses willing to go on record, with credentials. In Geneva, in addition to the university personnel who plan to come, we can also have others sign in and sign out, with their signature and credentials, to add to the list of witnesses of the technology running continuously. And by having a tag-team type of pass-off by always having someone else take over where they left off, a net duration can be established, with many overlapping witnesses throughout.Open Source? Another reason I would like to attend the Geneva expo will be to meet in person with Mr. Yildiz and talk through the possibility of having an open license for people to be able to pursue lower power versions of the design without an up-front license, with the stipulation that they remit a royalty on all commercial roll-outs. He has been very favorable so far in these discussions. My being there in person would be particularly important in seeing this to fruition.
 
BUDGET: $1,547.00 - Flight [Actual: 1,041.90, from booking earlier]) $1,333.00 - Hotel for 9 days $500 - Food $100 - Transportation $200 - Misc. buffer$184 - Fundraiser fee
$3864 - TotalAdjusted to raise: $3087 (We can't change total after campaign starts, so Sterling paid $777 into the fundrasier on March 25, to get it back once the campaign is funded, or refunded if the campaign doesn't meet the goal by at least 80%)
 
PROJECT GOALS:
Enable Sterling to attend the Geneva Inventors expo, to help Mr. Yildiz with his demonstration of the magnet motor technology. Enable Sterling to personally witness a working all-magnet motor for the first time, with proof of its validity, along with anyone else who wishes to observe online or attend the expo. Enable Sterling to discuss terms with Mr. Yildiz of open sourcing. Enable Sterling to speak at a press conference to be held announcing the accomplishment. Prove to the world that a new, clean energy modality has arrived, launching a new scientific and economic revolution.
 
PROJECT MILESTONES:
- Arrive in Geneva - Help set up demo, with a possible secondary location - Help collect witness signatures - Help interface between universities and Yildiz to meet validation requirements - Surpass the minimum duration to rule out hidden storage capacity - Surpass that by many times - Establish terms for open license - Demo much higher output capability for short durations - Post plans for open license of lower output versions (e.g. < 5 kW) - Press conference announcing success and ramifications
 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES:
 - Mr. Yildiz could be stopped in his transport across international borders, despite having documentation from the Turkish patent office stating the purpose for the round trip.- The motor(s) could be damaged during transport to the event. - Mr. Yildiz could encounter problems assembling the system. - The Expo venue may have rules (noise, safety) that disallow continuous operation of the motor. - Webcams could malfunction, interrupting continuous observation by Internet audience. - Mr. Yildiz may opt out of a secondary location because he wants to be present. - Mr. Yildiz could opt to not demo the technology for a sufficient period of time. - Mr. Yildiz could cancel the demo and only display the hardware.
 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:Q. If you don't raise the amount needed for the trip, what happens to the funds? A. The pledge is not collected if the goal is not met by at least 80%.Q. If the 25-cm fan is attached and run at the usual speed (producing a 380 Watt load), how long will the motor need to run to rule out a hidden storage capacity? A. 4.5 hours.Q. If the same motor is attached to a 1000-Watt load (e.g. bank of lights) via an alternator, how long will the motor need to run to rule out a hidden storage capacity? A. 102 minutes.Q. How are you calculating the storage capacity? A. One reader pointed out that: ""According to Wikipedia, Li-Ion batteries can have a volumetric power density of 1900 J/cm3. With the given dimensions of 14 cm diameter x 21L, the motor body can contain approx. 3200 cm3 * 1900J = 6139 kJ of energy if it was packed with Li-Ion batteries.  If the batteries fully discharge in 24 hrs, the power output would be about 71Watts on average."" That comes to 1704 Watt-hours.Q. Where can we watch the streamed version of the demo? A. The streaming location will be announced at PESWiki.com, among other places.
Q. How much does it cost to attend the Expo?A. Media gets in free. The admittance fee for the general public is CHF 14/day with no previous registration.

We collect donated plants, trees, soil, yard art, patio furniture, tools, and equipment. The flagship program is the semi-annual event where neighbors, gardeners, landscapers, and beginners come to share their bounty, extra supplies, and information with other garden enthusiasts. And, all for free! ​The Plant Exchange is a non-profit community service organization that reduces the impact of plant waste on the environment by serving as a central clearinghouse for the plant industry to donate excess materials that would otherwise go into landfills and compost piles.

<p>The Green C.A.S.L 40 acre ranch is utilized as a community retreat where ideas are shared and steps to act are taken. The Green CASL project exhibits working systems which demonstrate a
healthy, sustainable lifestyle in an artistic and engaging way. The Jenkstars
would like to continue to build a facility to host events on a regular basis
that are an interesting and educational example of how to utilize resources.
Not only do these events benefit the participants, they also benefit the
local Green River community by boosting the economy and generating a larger
dialogue and awareness about the local environmental issues. Our team is
excited to take this project to the next level. The Jenkstar Ranch is already
favored by hundreds of people as an incredible space and a beacon of hope.
Undoubtedly, it becomes “home” for everyone who visits. We educate and
inspire, spreading the message of sustainability through each ripple of
awareness that takes hold. We see a grand horizon of several hubs located on
the 40 acre property as retreat spaces, learning centers, event domes,
greenhouses, and several hands on workshops each year.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1412928/files/20150424174518-IndiGoGo_07.jpg?1429922718"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>

<h3>This is About Solutions. </h3>
<p><strong>Help us fund a live film and presentation at The Alamo Drafthouse on Thursday, April 27, 2017! </strong>Here is the story:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, i'm Chris Searles, founder of biointegrity.net. About two years ago i started raising funds to protect and restore Earth's most biodiverse ecosystems. Why? It's the best solution to climate change and a whole lot of other things. Since starting biointegrity we've protected enough biodiversity to offset Austin TX's community-wide carbon footprint 1.6 times and are currently reducing more greenhouse gas emissions per year than $1 billion worth of rooftop solar.<br/> </li>
<li>The biointegrity climate solution is not just reducing emissions, we're also helping to stop the extinction crisis, protect Earth's temperate climate system, protect global life support services production where it's most concentrated, protect our global food production industries, and protect hundreds of threatened indigenous communities.  <br/> </li>
<li>This presentation offers a breakthrough vision for stopping the extinction crisis and winning the climate challenge in the fastest, most affordable way possible. In addition to the monumental greenhouse gas reductions we've achieved,  we're helping protect more than 15,000 species, 15 million trees, 1 billion gallons of annual freshwater filtration, and billions of microbial species. We are just getting started and we're asking for your help. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's In It For You. </h3>
<p>Break'n it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We're Seeking $1,000!</strong> <br/>These funds will go to pay for the event and its filming and editing costs. We wish to raise these funds via ticket sales and donations. We have a matching grant to cover all remaining costs. Project budget available upon request. Thank you.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Here's What You Get!</strong><br/><strong>Tickets are $10. </strong>All ticket purchasers receive a ticket to the event.<strong> Dinner not provided</strong> at this time.<strong> </strong>Please note, however, <strong>this is a pretty exclusive event. </strong>There are only 33 seats available (first come, first serve). You may choose to ""keep"" or ""donate"" your tickets. Donated tickets can be given to a specific person or put into our donated tickets bucket for release to special guests.<br/><br/><strong>All attendees have the chance to win an Alamo Date Night Package </strong>(2 movie passes, 2 popcorns, 2 drinks), donated by the Alamo Drafthouse. We'll give this away<strong> </strong>during the event. Good luck!<br/><br/>Our <strong>funder</strong><strong> bonuses:</strong> offset your carbon footprint for life, protect the most biodiverse ecosystem on Earth, help one of the world's oldest indigenous communities retain rights and control over their ancestral lands, <i><u>and</u></i> get you a free drink from the Alamo's beer, wine, cocktail, soda, coffee, or tea menu. <br/> <br/><strong>All ticket purchases of $20, $50 or $100 also get: </strong><ul>
<li>Free drink ticket ($10 value) for our event</li>
<li>Amazon acres protected in their name (2, 10, or 20)</li>
<li>A PDF Contributor's Report commemorating your gift to this project and highlighting the most outstanding impacts of the acres protected in your honor (We'll email this to you)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Help Us Spread the Word! </strong><br/>By helping us you're helping the world. Thanks again, please share this with your friends.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>You Can Afford to Save the World. </h3>
<p>If our IndieGoGo campaign is 100% successful we'll protect at least 100 acres of the most biodiverse region of the Amazon, have a great night at the Drafthouse, cover most of our expenses, and make a great video. </p>
<p>Here is more information about how helping biointegrity helps the world:</p>
<ul><li>
<i>These Acres are Special. </i>The acres we've chosen to protect in your honor, should you choose to purchase a ticket for $20 or more, and help us produce this event:  <ul>
<li>Are integral to Earth's climate system. </li>
<li>Contain a minimum of 250 tons of forest-stored CO2 per acre. </li>
<li>Shelter the headwaters of the Amazon River, the world's largest river. </li>
<li>Reduce global greenhouse pollution by more than 1 ton per acre, per year. </li>
<li>Will combine to protect more than 1.3 million acres, and connect together 7.8 million acres, of the most biodiverse ecosystem on Earth. </li>
<li>Are home to at least 3,000 to 4,000 plant species, 1,000s of insect species, more than 500 bird species, 80 amphibian, species, and 100s more reptile, mammal, and other species. </li>
<li>Are home to one of the Amazon's most ancient indigenous communities, The Secoya people. </li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Power of Supporting BioIntegrity. </h3>
<p>So far, our supporters have helped protect nearly 80,000 acres of places like this region of the Amazon, resulting in a net Ecological ROI of: </p>
<ul>
<li>  +15 million trees  – protected</li>
<li>  +23 million tons tree-stored CO2 – protected</li>
<li>  Billions &amp; billions of microbial species – protected</li>
<li>  +100 threatened indigenous communities – co-protected</li>
<li><strong>  +68,000 tons annual carbon sequestration – protected</strong></li>
<li><strong>  +15,000 threatened plant &amp; animal species – protected</strong></li>
<li><strong>  +1 billion gallons annual freshwater filtration – protected</strong></li>

Hi, i'm Chris Searles, founder of biointegrity.net. About two years ago i started raising funds to protect and restore Earth's most biodiverse ecosystems. Why? It's the best solution to climate change and a whole lot of other things. Since starting biointegrity we've protected enough biodiversity to offset Austin TX's community-wide carbon footprint 1.6 times and are currently reducing more greenhouse gas emissions per year than $1 billion worth of rooftop solar. 
The biointegrity climate solution is not just reducing emissions, we're also helping to stop the extinction crisis, protect Earth's temperate climate system, protect global life support services production where it's most concentrated, protect our global food production industries, and protect hundreds of threatened indigenous communities.   
This presentation offers a breakthrough vision for stopping the extinction crisis and winning the climate challenge in the fastest, most affordable way possible. In addition to the monumental greenhouse gas reductions we've achieved,  we're helping protect more than 15,000 species, 15 million trees, 1 billion gallons of annual freshwater filtration, and billions of microbial species. We are just getting started and we're asking for your help. 

 

 
What's In It For You. 
Break'n it down:


We're Seeking $1,000! These funds will go to pay for the event and its filming and editing costs. We wish to raise these funds via ticket sales and donations. We have a matching grant to cover all remaining costs. Project budget available upon request. Thank you. 

Here's What You Get!Tickets are $10. All ticket purchasers receive a ticket to the event. Dinner not provided at this time. Please note, however, this is a pretty exclusive event. There are only 33 seats available (first come, first serve). You may choose to ""keep"" or ""donate"" your tickets. Donated tickets can be given to a specific person or put into our donated tickets bucket for release to special guests.All attendees have the chance to win an Alamo Date Night Package (2 movie passes, 2 popcorns, 2 drinks), donated by the Alamo Drafthouse. We'll give this away during the event. Good luck!Our funder bonuses: offset your carbon footprint for life, protect the most biodiverse ecosystem on Earth, help one of the world's oldest indigenous communities retain rights and control over their ancestral lands, and get you a free drink from the Alamo's beer, wine, cocktail, soda, coffee, or tea menu.  All ticket purchases of $20, $50 or $100 also get: 
Free drink ticket ($10 value) for our event
Amazon acres protected in their name (2, 10, or 20)
A PDF Contributor's Report commemorating your gift to this project and highlighting the most outstanding impacts of the acres protected in your honor (We'll email this to you)



Help Us Spread the Word! By helping us you're helping the world. Thanks again, please share this with your friends.  


 
 
You Can Afford to Save the World. 
If our IndieGoGo campaign is 100% successful we'll protect at least 100 acres of the most biodiverse region of the Amazon, have a great night at the Drafthouse, cover most of our expenses, and make a great video. 
Here is more information about how helping biointegrity helps the world:

These Acres are Special. The acres we've chosen to protect in your honor, should you choose to purchase a ticket for $20 or more, and help us produce this event:  
Are integral to Earth's climate system. 
Contain a minimum of 250 tons of forest-stored CO2 per acre. 
Shelter the headwaters of the Amazon River, the world's largest river. 
Reduce global greenhouse pollution by more than 1 ton per acre, per year. 
Will combine to protect more than 1.3 million acres, and connect together 7.8 million acres, of the most biodiverse ecosystem on Earth. 
Are home to at least 3,000 to 4,000 plant species, 1,000s of insect species, more than 500 bird species, 80 amphibian, species, and 100s more reptile, mammal, and other species. 
Are home to one of the Amazon's most ancient indigenous communities, The Secoya people. 


 
 
The Power of Supporting BioIntegrity. 
So far, our supporters have helped protect nearly 80,000 acres of places like this region of the Amazon, resulting in a net Ecological ROI of: 

  +15 million trees  – protected
  +23 million tons tree-stored CO2 – protected
  Billions & billions of microbial species – protected
  +100 threatened indigenous communities – co-protected
  +68,000 tons annual carbon sequestration – protected
  +15,000 threatened plant & animal species – protected
  +1 billion gallons annual freshwater filtration – protected

Risks & Challenges.
Can't think of any downsides! We're asking for your help funding this project. We hope to fill all 33 seats, but who knows? ... We may go SRO!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Since I can remember I've been intrigued by wildlife and the wilderness that they call home. Yet much about what I'm passionate about has been altered, changed, modified and sometimes even outright destroyed at the hand of humanity. Therefore much of my ambition and zest has been focused on restoring and recreating lost and forgotten wilderness areas - both locally and around the world. Eight years in the making, <i><strong>Rewilding The Lost Wilderness</strong></i> has been the result of my intense pursuit of restoration of the Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>After much eager anticipation I can finally say that <strong><i>Rewilding The Lost Wilderness</i></strong> at 273 pages is ready to go to market with the inspirational tale of Rewilding the Cape. This story of a quintessential African wilderness that has been lost and regained is a story of hope and restoration! A tale of hope for all the wilderness areas that has been lost, and an example for all wilderness areas that is still to be regained! Rewilding The Lost Wilderness is much anticipated among the international rewilding community for whom the book will serve as a practical example for the recreation of lost wilderness areas, especially so in parts of Europe and North America.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $7,000 (seven thousand USD) to go to print and complete production. I would like to call on your help to bring <strong><i>Rewilding The Lost Wilderness</i></strong> to life with an <strong><i>early-bird purchase</i></strong>, <strong><i>sponsorship purchase </i></strong>or <strong><i>contribution.</i></strong>  See perks for Sponsorship Purchase and Contribution options!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Help to get <strong><i>Rewilding The Lost Wilderness</i></strong> into school and national libraries and on shelves, in tourism offices to facilitate exposure to all the decision makers in conservation and rewilding circles throughout Southern Africa and among the international arena.</p>

Short Summary THIS IS AN URGENT REQUEST FOR HELP TO RESCUE CECILIO LOPEZ-TERCERO, A SPANISH CAVER INJURED 400 METERS DEEP IN A CAVE IN PERU. 
Cecilio López-Tercero (40), belongs to the club GEODA of Madrid. He is a member of the Committee on cave-diving and was head of the Cave Rescue Group in the Madrid Federation of Caving (Federación Madrileña de Espeleología, FME). Degree in Biology from the University of Alcalá de Henares and Biochemistry from the Complutense University of Madrid, has extensive experience in campaigns caving in Spain, South America and Africa.
What We Need 
 The FME, as the official association of cavers from Madrid, Spain, asks for your help to contribute with money to the rescue of Cecilio (Ceci, for his friends).
On September 18th, 2014, Ceci suffered an accident at 400 meters deep in the cave of Inti Machay, located in Huriaca (municipality Leimebamba, Department of Amazonas), a jungle area of difficult access located 1,200 kilometers from Lima (Peru). Ceci suffered a fifteen feet fall hitting badly on his back. He broke two lumbar vertebrae and he was unable to leave the cave by himself.   
More than 40 Spanish cavers have already traveled to Peru to assist Ceci in his rescue.

The FME asks for volunteers to participate in the rescue and funds to pay for it. 

  The Impact Ceci's life is in serious danger. He still remains in the cave ten days past the accident with his back broken. 
The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation has informed us that they ""cannot financially support the rescue because they have no budget, and even if they had any, their protocols do not cover a case like this"" (You can read this information at http://desnivel.com/expediciones/el-espeleologo-cecilio-lopez-no-podra-salir-de-la-cueva-hasta-que-no-lleguen-refuerzos) 

ALL THESE EXPENSES HAVE TO BE FUNDED BY VOLUNTEER DONATIONS AS YOURS:
- Transport (flights from Spain, helicopters, road transfers, etc.) 
- Support staff (There are about 100 people involved in the rescue) 
- Medical care (health personnel, hospital, medical transportation, etc.)

<p>We fabricate and distribute Sistema Biobolsa, a high quality modular biodigester that transforms agricultural and human waste into renewable energy and organic fertilizer to increase the productivity of small farms and reduce environmental and health challenges related to waste management.  We aim to reach hundreds of millions of small farmer worldwide through education and a directed microfinance programs.</p>
<p>We have brought our business to scale in central Mexico, and now we want to expand.  We will do over one million US in sales in 2012, with clients in 20 states in Mexico, Nicaragua, and Haiti.  We have over 4000 people using biogas technology in six countries, but there are over 4 million farms in Mexico alone that could utilize the technology, tens of millions of farms in Latin America and the Caribbean, and hundreds of millions in the world.   </p>
<p><strong>What these Indiegogo Funds will Do</strong></p>
<p>With the money raised from Indiegogo, we will install “seed” systems in new communities that will expand the reach of the technology and our market based program.  The key to creating demand and selling systems is demonstrating the technology in a local context.  That is what each $500 raised during this campaign will do: open up a new region with thousands of farmers to our technology.  Specifically, these seeds will be planted in Chiapas where they will serve as a pilot in a program that will have joint funding from the farmers, Kellogg, Heifer, and KIVA.  However, these pilots are the first step to making that program grow.  So this very small action of supporting us will have residual impacts on thousand of small farmers.     </p>
<p><strong>How Else You Can Participate</strong></p>
<p>As we open up new regions to Sistema Biobolsa, we need to expand our ability to provide loan funding.  This requires capital within our revolving loan fund.  We also need local partners, and we hope to develop a broad network of entrepreneurs and businesses that will offer our Sistema Biobolsa through their networks.  Grants, donations and sate funding are often very useful to plant the “seed” systems and begin the initial promotion and educational programs like the one we will run with Indiegogo funds.  We are always looking for talented people to join our team and help us grow and spread our message further.  In order to build human resources and capacity, we are interested in equity finance and standard financing options that will allow us access to capital as we increase our geographic coverage.   </p>
<p><strong>More About Sistema Biobolsa</strong></p>
<p>Sistema Biobolsa fills the need for an accessible yet reliable biodgester system on the market. By converting waste to resources, the benefits of biodigesters also address many pressing development challenges. Waste treatment removes organic loading and pathogen contamination of local watersheds, and drastically improves sanitary conditions, lowering enteric disease risks. Poor sanitation infrastructure has been shown to be a key limitation to development. Biogas produced by the treated waste can be used for cooking, heating, or electrical generation to lower energy costs, exposure to poor indoor air quality, and deforestation from biomass or fossil fuel sources. The resulting organic fertilizer can reduce agricultural inputs costs by 80%, making small farmers more productive and economically competitive. A transition to organic agriculture counteracts the broad degradation of agricultural lands through years of chemical fertilizer use. Local fertilizer production makes small producer less susceptible to volatile global prices of agricultural commodities.</p>
<p>The waste, energy, and agricultural benefits of Sistema Biobolsa also have greenhouse gas emissions impacts, and each system has been shown to reduce an average of 5 toCO2e per year, and there are 600 million small farms worldwide that could utilize this technology today.  These health, environmental, and productivity gains all have positive economic impacts. Strengthening rural economies through small farmers has residual impacts on the larger community, since declining rural productivity is a key driver of immigration and crime in the developing world. Supporting small farmers also improves food security, biodiversity, and social equity. Our comprehensive capacity building program trains large groups of installers and promoters to overcome challenges related to scaling across a wide geographic and socioeconomic space. Our financing program removes the first-cost barrier that limits the market development of many important technologies. Finally, our data management and monitoring system allows us to overcome challenges related to technological adoption, reporting and after-sales service.</p>
<p><strong>The Sistema Biobolsa Team</strong></p>
<p>A key strength of this project is its ability to attract talented interdisciplinary thinkers at the leadership level, as well as involve farmers, agricultural extension agents, and entrepreneurs on the ground.  Alexander Eaton is the CEO of Sistema Biobolsa, and is currently an Ashoka Fellow, an honor that acknowledges the ability of this project to create systemic change and have a global impact.  The Dutch Businesses in Development Network recognized Eaton as the Global Entrepreneur of the Year in 2010. His early work was funded as a Switzer Environmental Leadership Fellow, the Global Methane Initiative, and by working through international industrial biodigester firms. </p>
<p>Our COO, Camilo Pages, has ten years of entrepreneurship, marketing, and business development in the sustainable development space, and was recognized in 2011 as one of Mexico's most innovative entrepreneurs for his role in Sistema Biobolsa.  Pages strives to integrate strong business practices and innovative marketing into his work, and pulls from a broad business network in Mexico.  Pages also comes from an industrial family, and his early business development was in fabrication and distribution in the automotive industry.   </p>
<p>Eleazar Ortiz worked in Mexican educational development for eight years before he completed a Masters Degree in Public Policy from the NYU Wagner school.   Ortiz now works on collaborative development strategies that allows for the integration of stakeholders into the Sistema Biobolsa program.</p>
<p>Our CFO Jorge Arellano has over 40 years of experience in finance, and manages our finance fund, and economic growth strategies. Arellano has worked for a long list of multi-national companies, and is experienced in international accounting standards and how to manage the finances of international distribution and sales.</p>
<p>Juan Gonzalez moved to our fabrication plant after 30 years of running industrial processes and fabrication in the automotive industry.  His specialty is process management and quality control, and he manages a strong team of engineers and fabrication workers at our production plant in Toluca, Mexico.  Humza Arshad is a talented young technological expert that has helped develop and implement a world-class data management system that serves as our scalable organizational platform.</p>
<p>On the ground in 18 Mexican states and three LAC countries we have thousands of trained technicians, farmers, and small business owners that now promote Sistema Biobolsa in their own region.  We have a strong network of research partners, NGOs, and international participants that add capacity, lessons, learned and oversight of our work. </p>
<p>Finally, our board of directors in made up of successful businessmen that have a talent for scaling, and a network of professionals that provide constant consultation and education for the core team.  The combination of this wide variety of skills, contacts, and passion has created a top-notch team that is wired for innovation and set on scaling this big idea.  </p>

<h3>Our Volunteers Have Heart and Dedication </h3>
<p>Whale Scout volunteers help hundreds of people watch whales every year - many for the first time!  Each individual volunteer goes beyond their interest in whales by taking action, becoming leaders in their community promoting change. Much of this work is difficult and done in cold and wet weather. Whale Scouts are so passionate about whales that they plant trees in the rain, push heavy wheelbarrows full of mulch uphill, literally bleed as they remove invasive blackberries from native plants, and wear special gloves to keep their freezing fingers steady on their binoculars and ready to text their sightings. The rain is our liquid sunshine! </p>
<p>Our efforts are expanding rapidly. In the next year we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant 500 trees</li>
<li>Assist 1,000 people to watch whales </li>
<li>Engage 300 school kids in learning about whales </li>
<li>Give 800 hours of service restoring salmon habitat</li>
<li>Much more! </li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3>We Want To Do Even More </h3>
<p>We are raising funds to keep this team moving forward protecting Pacific Northwest whales at a time when the stakes are higher than ever. Our volunteers deserve to have better materials and tools to make the biggest impact for the whales as possible. We also want to invest in their education, provide well-coordinated volunteer opportunities to engage and inspire the public, and help offset some of their personal out-of-pocket expenses such as ferry tickets. Next year our grant support from Fish and Wildlife will run out. We can't do this without your support. Raising $5,000 in this campaign will help volunteers in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give the approximately 20 new volunteers naturalist materials including our weather-proof diagrams, charts, and maps made specifically for Whale Scouts to share with the public</li>
<li>Print mini brochures with info about whales and our Helpin' Out events</li>
<li>Offer a dedicated volunteer leader on San Juan Island </li>
<li>Start a book club to continue education for volunteers and engage the public </li>
<li>Revitalize the Whale Scout Podcast </li>
<li>Host scientists, communication experts, and other naturalists at volunteer trainings to educate volunteers on the latest research</li>
<li>Partner with organizations to develop coordinated orca stewardship materials</li>
<li>Host special events such as the Black Friday's #Optoutside or Earth Day, where volunteers can engage the public on non-whale days in a coordinated fashion</li>
<li>Continue to provide volunteers with the most recent version of the Center for Whale Research's Orca ID Guide </li>
<li>Offer ferry ticket reimbursement for volunteer activities </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution matters. Please help empower this group of volunteers to save whales by restoring their prey's habitat and inspire others to do the same. Ensuring our local endangered orcas have enough salmon to eat is the single most important thing we can do to save them. Many of them are suffering from starvation. Restoring salmon streams has great potential to feed orcas and can be done right in our own backyards.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The Southern Resident killer whale community is unique in that they swim through waters in urban areas allowing researchers to track them individually throughout their lives, and offering many people the opportunity to view them in the wild. Whales such as Mike, Blackberry, and Granny are famous and known around the world. They are a treasure of the Pacific Northwest and are in peril. These whales are worth saving. Imagine the joy you might see on your child's face in the future as you watch whales thrive in the waters of Seattle or Victoria. </li>
<li>Whale Scout has a proven track record. Our volunteer team was born three years ago and has grown steadily since then. We've been awarded grants in the past and have successfully worked with other groups to leverage our resources. We are firmly rooted in this effort and will not let up until Pacific Northwest whales are protected. </li>

<h3>Straight from Volunteer Experience</h3>
<p>""I did not find the whales, they found me. A wonderful woman whom I admire and look up to lent me a book on the orca and said I really should read it.  I smiled and nodded, politely took the book she handed me and said ""Thank you,"" but on the inside I was already grumbling to myself that now I HAD to read it because when I return it in a few weeks, she's going to ask how I enjoyed it. Begrudgingly one weekend I sat down to read it and was immediately immersed in the world of the Southern Resident killer whale population and their fantastically complicated social structure.  Families stay together all their lives? They babysit other calves? They have greeting ceremonies after they've been apart for some time? Wow, wow, and WOW!</p>
<p>Jump ahead in time a few years and now I love standing on a beach helping others spot the whales while hopefully providing them new information about the whales that they didn't already know. Yes, they are endangered. No, they are not getting enough food, but here's a list of some things you can do to help. Yes, you are only one person, but, there's a whole village full of you. </p>
<p>There's a certain look that some people get in their eyes when I know they are feeling the same way I did reading that book. I'm just one person too, but there are so many whale advocates out there, I have to believe that this village of advocates we are building can make a difference for these icons of the Salish Sea.""  </p>

<em>“Making the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone.”</em> - Buckminster Fuller’s Mission</h3>
<p>Marshall McLuhan said Buckminster Fuller was “the 20<sup>th</sup> Century Leonardo da Vinci.”  Because of his wisdom and years (if not lifetimes) of experience, he was also known as “Grandfather of the Future” and the “Grandfather of the Universe.”   <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Check out the Bio Video above (when in 1982 he said <strong>""if within five years we haven't learned to take care of everybody, it's all over for everybody""</strong>)  for more details.</span></em></p>

<p>Fuller (who preferred that everyone call him “Bucky”) labeled himself a “comprehensive anticipatory design scientist,” focused on solving problems he believed would appear 50 to 100 years in the future.  Just prior to his death in 1983, he said that he felt humankind had about eight years to solve our major global problems including environmental degradation, hunger, homelessness, lack of available education and health care for all.  Clearly, we have not met his goal, but we’re still trying to create his vision of  “a world that works for everyone.”</p>

Marshall McLuhan said Buckminster Fuller was “the 20th Century Leonardo da Vinci.”  Because of his wisdom and years (if not lifetimes) of experience, he was also known as “Grandfather of the Future” and the “Grandfather of the Universe.”   Check out the Bio Video above (when in 1982 he said ""if within five years we haven't learned to take care of everybody, it's all over for everybody"")  for more details.

Fuller (who preferred that everyone call him “Bucky”) labeled himself a “comprehensive anticipatory design scientist,” focused on solving problems he believed would appear 50 to 100 years in the future.  Just prior to his death in 1983, he said that he felt humankind had about eight years to solve our major global problems including environmental degradation, hunger, homelessness, lack of available education and health care for all.  Clearly, we have not met his goal, but we’re still trying to create his vision of  “a world that works for everyone.”

“It is not for me to change you. The question is, how can I be of service to you without diminishing your degrees of freedom?” - Bucky Fuller

This is why his ideas, solutions and vision are more important than ever.  This campaign will help keep Bucky’s unique perspective alive, vibrant and public.  I have been studying Bucky’s vision and applying his ideas to my life since he died.  I have also been writing and speaking about his solutions, and I am the only person who has had two books about Bucky published by reputable publishers.  There are several more Bucky books in the pipeline, and this project will help move them along at a much faster pace.
In the past few years, I’ve applied the latest digital technology to share Bucky’s vision.  You can check out my

Although each of these venues is unique, the message is always consistent … we have the ability to survive and thrive as a species if we shift our focus and resources from weaponry to livingry.  We can also use Bucky’s life as a proven template for each of us making a difference as global citizens on board the planet he named Spaceship Earth.
Your financial support will allow me to expand the amount and diversity of writing and graphics I can produce and disperse.  It will also provide the impetus to complete and publish Volume 2 of the series that began with A Fuller View.  That book is entitled A Fuller Way, Buckminster Fuller’s Life Affirming Path To Success, and it is more than half completed.  Like A Fuller View, it will have many Guest Commentators, but the presentation will be identical to AFV.  There are many important people who have something to say about Bucky and his wisdom, and some of these potential Guest Commentators are getting on in years, so it’s critical to gather their wisdom as soon as possible.

The
State of California is planning to build 2 giant tunnels, each 40 feet in diameter,
150 feet underneath the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The tunnels would run about 30 miles, from
just south of Sacramento to just north of Tracy. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This is deceptively called  the <i>""Bay Delta Conservation Plan"" (BDCP).</i></span></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;""><b>What for?</b></b></h4><p><b>

The tunnels could carry up to 2/3 of the flow of the Sacramento River.</b>  This is the main supply of fresh water in the Delta which flows into the SF Bay.  Right now, only about 30% of water exported from the Delta goes to cities in the Bay Area, the South Coast, and Southern California. <b> Corporate agribusinesses on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, down to Bakersfield, get about 70% of the water, yet only contribute .3% to the state's economy.</b></p>

<p>

Diverting
all this fresh water will result in saltier, polluted water in the Delta and the Bay Area. This will affect farmers as well as
commercial and recreational fishermen. 
It will also affect cities in the Delta region by impacting their
municipal water and discharge systems, and the environment of the whole
Bay-Delta Estuary.</p>
<p>If
you live in an area that relies on export water, your water rates will go
up. As of now, <b>the estimated cost is over $60 BILLION</b> making it one of the largest and most expensive public work projects in U.S. history with no guarantee that it will provide more reliable water supply for Californians. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If

<b>Reducing Global
Warming through </b><b>Capturing Airborne Carbon Dioxide. Replenishing Soil for Life.</b>
</h3>

There are many contributing factors
to the Global Warming crisis facing our planet and equally as many
consequences. Some have gained more public awareness than others. Soil
Sequestration is an important part of solving this and other issues facing
future generations such as food security and food quality. Soil
Sequestration is a method of capturing Co2 in the air and returning it back to
the Soil for long term plant sustainability and the survival of all living
things.<br/><br/><h3>Carbon Dioxide Storage in Soil</h3>
<p>The growing concern of too much Carbon Dioxide in our
atmosphere is a world-wide problem. We know that Co2 stored in soil is released
through felling of native forests and over farming and tilling of agricultural
land. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796753/files/20140818182026-header_soils.jpg?1408411226"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It is estimated that soils contain between 700 gigatonnes (Gt, 109 tonnes)
and 3000 Gt of carbon, or more than three times the amount of carbon stored in
the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. However, most agricultural soils have lost
50–70 per cent of the original soil organic carbon pool that was present in the
natural ecosystem prior to clearing and cultivation. When forests are converted
to agricultural land, the soil carbon content decreases dramatically and needs
to be managed well. This depletion happens because organic matter in the soil
decomposes following ground disturbance while, at the same time, less carbon
enters the soil because the clearance has reduced the biomass above ground as
well. Practices such as stubble burning will also reduce it even more.
Agricultural usages such as grazing, harvesting and tillage also tend to reduce
soil carbon, as does increased erosion that is often a result of mass open
space farming.</p>
<p>Given the enormous carbon storage capacity of soils, it has been suggested
that with appropriate changes in agriculture management practices, could
represent a significant reduction in atmospheric Co2. Managing agriculture to
increase valuable organic carbon content can improve soil health and sustainable
productivity by adding essential nutrients and increasing water-holding
capacity, so essential for deep root development.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796775/files/20140818182937-enhanced-carbon.jpg?1408411777"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>The Organic Solution</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Mel Holzworth and I am the CFO of an
emerging, innovative, Organic Certified Liquid Plant and Soil Super Food company based
in Brisbane, Australia. I have been an accountant for 30 years and a while back
I embraced the vision of this forward thinking team of people. The creator of
this technology is Danny Hood, a 5th generation farmer who has first-hand
experience of the problems farmers face every day. With the development of a
ground breaking technology, we are achieving the return of vitality back into our
soil which is so necessary for the promotion and growth of healthy plants and
nutritious tasting food, once again. A bit like Pop used to grow in his vegie
garden when we were kids.</p>
<p>Recently, a well-known sugar cane farmer in Qld, Australia
reported, after using the nutrient that not only did his soil health return
quickly, but it was enriched with carbon and microbes. Scientific testing with
the technology has been carried out which has resulted in confirming that
carbon sequestration had returned to the soil with ease and at a very low cost
to the farmer.</p>
<p>The vision of what can be achieved on a global
level is truly astounding. Can you imagine the positive effect if not only
commercial farmers were embracing Soil Sequestration, but also the humble home gardener.

<p><b>Now, Where from here?</b></p>
<p>As is the case with any worthwhile project we need to fund
lab work and also field testing on a larger scale and on different soil types
and climate variations, not only in Australia, but globally. Yes, we have big
plans.</p>
<p>We will run our 1st range of field testing on Sugar Cane
Farms in Far North Qld, Australia, also potato crops in Gatton Qld. Wheat farms
in the Narrogin area, in Western Australia. This program of clinical testing
will run over a 2 year period and involve at least 4 crop harvest cycles.</p>
<p>Although the lab work will continue before, during and after
each harvest cycle, it does come as a huge expense as the range of tests
required on both soil and plants are extensive but vital to the production of a
range of documents supporting what we know already to be true.</p>
<p>As we ask for funding for the 1st phase of the project we
are confident of our success on a global level.  </p>
<p><b>Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>By donating you will become an advocate in the era of Globally Sustainable Biology
through Dr Grow It All. You will be making a difference to the future of world
food security and nutrition and thus the health of mankind.</p>
<p>Other ways you can help</p>

The mind boggles.This video is a third party production which supports the principles of Dr Grow It All's ethos on planet health. The vital link to Globally Sustainable Biology.
Now, Where from here?
As is the case with any worthwhile project we need to fund
lab work and also field testing on a larger scale and on different soil types
and climate variations, not only in Australia, but globally. Yes, we have big
plans.
We will run our 1st range of field testing on Sugar Cane
Farms in Far North Qld, Australia, also potato crops in Gatton Qld. Wheat farms
in the Narrogin area, in Western Australia. This program of clinical testing
will run over a 2 year period and involve at least 4 crop harvest cycles.
Although the lab work will continue before, during and after
each harvest cycle, it does come as a huge expense as the range of tests
required on both soil and plants are extensive but vital to the production of a
range of documents supporting what we know already to be true.
As we ask for funding for the 1st phase of the project we
are confident of our success on a global level.

Summary
Presently we are exporting small quantities of our plant and soil super nutrient
to India, China and USA. Can you imagine what would happen if we could further
develop a product that will help each country meet their carbon emissions
targets. Imagine the benefits farming operations could offer the world through
carbon sequestration and making the world a better place for generations to
come. You could help us achieve this. Wow!!!!",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Coral
reefs, one of the world’s natural wonders and a hotbed of biodiversity, are
under threat; populations of coral are declining throughout the world, and in
the Caribbean in particular. Today there is a growing number of individuals that
specialize in the growth and health of coral who can help turn the tide. We
invite you to take part in an exciting project to help the threatened coral
reefs of the Caribbean. With your help, we can regrow these coral reefs and
educate the next generation of environmental stewards, educators, and
scientists. </p>
<p>A unique
opportunity to make a significant impact on the health and sustainability of
Caribbean reefs is available to us in Grand Case, St. Martin. The local
stakeholders in Grand Case look forward to our involvement in their community,
and we have already laid the groundwork to develop this project during previous
visits and meetings. </p>
<p>There are
currently no major efforts in or around St. Martin, or the neighboring islands’
waters, to farm coral for transplantation back to adjacent reefs. The coral in
this area represent a unique set of genetics that needs to be preserved, since,
due to the distance, these coral cannot breed with coral in the areas where
these helpful programs are taking place. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/781535/files/20140811215419-P4031873.JPG?1407819259"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Coral reefs are complex biological communities, something like
cities.  If one segment (or zone) is disrupted the whole reef ceases to
operate normally and is endangered.  There are attempts all over the world
to restock damaged, almost extinct coral reefs, but usually they consist of the
introduction one or several species of farmed corals. </p>
<p>Our project will be unique in that we
recognize the interdependence of the parts of the reef.  We have a unique
capability to replace the WHOLE reef structure, placing each of the interdependent
species at the appropriate depth.  We will be the first program to
recreate extinct or damaged reefs as a whole, not as an aggregation of a few
species.</p>
<p>Our efforts will be enhanced by our
capability to create relatively large coral colonies, thus speeding the
recovery of the reef.  We will apply our newly discovered technologies to
enhance coral growth and culture a multiplicity of coral species.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/781586/files/20140811221858-P3311250.JPG?1407820738"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>The funds raised
will cover the legal costs associated with creating a non-profit organization to
administer the reef restoration and education programs, and to ensure sustained
support. We will develop three different artificial reef structures to provide
a suitable substrate to grow coral, as well as a habitat for certain types of
larval and juvenile fish. We will also have a more natural, and aesthetically
pleasing design, to blend in with the surroundings.  We will test some of our designs in Long
Island waters, where many species of tropical Caribbean fish settle out during
the summer. Tropical larval fish expert Todd Gardner will analyze which fish
settle on different reef construction configurations. We will determine which
designs appeal to the most beneficial fish species, such as the grouper,
surgeonfish, and parrotfish.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/786449/files/20140813160800-_MG_0580.jpg?1407971280"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote>A portion of Joe Yaiullo's 20,000 gallon reef aquarium.                       Photo credit: Daniel Knop</blockquote><p></p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are beyond excited to be working with this amazing non-profit however, we need your help! Our goal is to raise $1,000 to help with the cost of spay and neuters and medication. Your donation will help us reach that goal! The impact your donation will have on our community is great. You will help us raise the moral of animal lovers across the community, help lower the number of stray pets in Knoxville, and help the Young Williams Animal Center operate on a more efficient level with the amount of money that our campaign will generate from your help! Our campaign will also help YWAC spread their name across the community and at our school’s campus. This will help them reach out to potential adopters to adopt a furbaby from Young Williams. The more animals that are adopted the more room they have for  animals they need to take in! </p>
<p><br/>Every donation no matter the amount is very important to our community and YWAC. To thank you for your effort and generous donation we will be offering different perk packages for each different donation! </p>
<p><strong>Perk package #1 </strong></p>
<p>For a $1 donation you will receive a Young-Williams Animal Center sticker.</p>
<p><strong>Perk package #2</strong></p>
<p>For a $5 donation you will receive a Tennessee Coozie in Grey or Orange!</p>
<p><strong>Perk package #3</strong></p>
<p>For a $10  donation you will receive a clear Tennessee tote bag. Purr-fect for football and basketball games!</p>
<p><strong>Perk Package #4</strong></p>
<p>For a $20 donation you will receive a sweet treat or suprise from Riverdog Bakery!</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Every year 2,000 stray, lost and abandoned animals are brought to Young-Williams Animal Center. In 2018 YWAC became a no kill shelter, yay! Giving these animals a second chance at life in a loving home is something Young Williams is successful in doing. However, spay and neutering, along with medication for certain animals can be expensive. Our group wants to fundraise for YWAC and help them care for every pet that enters their temporary home. Our campaign is where animal lovers can potentially donate and receive pictured perks for each donation value.</p>

<h3>The EcoAdventure</h3>
<p>Each year, River Watchers have an opportunity to spend their spring break participating in a one-week EcoAdventure. This EcoAdventure is a transformative, educational experience that cultivates the imagination, resourcefulness, environmental awareness, and collaborative skills of our young explorers,<i> our future environmental stewards</i>.</p>
<p>Last year, the young men of River Watch explored the geological diversity of West Texas. This year, the 18th Annual EcoAdventure, is for the young women of River Watch and will take place in East Texas. River Watchers will have the opportunity to camp in state parks, engage in one-of-a-kind environmental activities, and make lasting memories. They will learn about the wildlife and the ecology of the land as they hike trails, sleep under the stars, and form meaningful friendships with their peers. The EcoAdventure is a culminating experience for our River Watchers, where many of the lessons of environmental stewardship of the past year on the local level will coalesce into a deeper, global understanding and appreciation for nature.</p>
<p><i>For many of our students, this will be their first overnight camping trip - for some, their first road trip. It'll be their first time pitching a tent, building a fire, and roasting s'mores. Many have never ventured outside of Austin, and few have had the awe-inspiring experience of gazing up at a sky full of stars.</i></p>
<h3>Austin Youth River Watch</h3>
<p>Austin Youth River Watch is a multi-year, afterschool and summer program for high school students, combining youth development with intensive environmental education. Our ""River Watchers"" engage in hands-on science activities and environmental restoration projects. They are trained to collect and analyze water quality data, which is then reported to local and statewide agencies. Working in and around Austin's natural waterways, they learn about real-world issues such as biological diversity, erosion, and ecological sustainability.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every year, Austin Youth River Watch <strong>transforms the lives of 120 high-school students</strong> through holistic, youth-development activities that focus on academic success and environmental stewardship, making a positive impact on Austin’s environment and community.</p>
<p>The work of River Watchers on local water quality is critical, and goes towards preventing environmental tragedies such as the Flint water crisis. They have often been the first to detect spills and notify local authorities about conditions in neighborhood creeks and streams.</p>
<p>River Watchers do not necessarily have the best grades, nor do many of them come to us with initial interests in STEM. All are defined as ""at-risk"" by Texas Education Code, and yet nearly 100% of them have graduated high school since our founding in 1992. After just one year of participation, 89% report greater confidence with science, and 97% report greater knowledge of environmental issues. Nearly 40% of our students go on to work or study in STEM or environmental fields. Our alumni have become professional and personal environmental stewards working in government, academia, nonprofits, and industry. Some have even become environmental educators themselves.</p>
<p>Our students lead the way in understanding and positively impacting water quality in our local streams. And did you know that, since the time we started our work nearly 25 years ago, <strong>nearly 100% of our students have earned their high school diplomas</strong>? These are our planet's future stewards. Your contribution will not only invest in our important environmental work, but also the lives of underserved youth!</p>
<h3>The Funding</h3>
<p>The entire EcoAdventure will cost approximately $5,000. Your support will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuel for vans - $600</li>
<li>Groceries and supplies for the entire group - $3,600</li>
<li>Campsite reservations - $200</li>
<li>Camping and first aid supplies - $600</li>
</ul>
<p>All funds raised beyond the initial $5,000 will go towards Austin Youth River Watch's overall programming, of which the EcoAdventure is a key part. All contributions are considered unrestricted and cannot be specified for any particular purpose. Your support is greatly appreciated, and will impact youth who would otherwise never have such an opportunity.</p>
<p>For all donations $50 and above, we are happy to provide an official Austin Youth River Watch vintage design Austin Creeks map t-shirt as a token of our thanks. Wear it proudly!</p>

started as an idea in the heads of a group nature lovers, activists who are
passionate about holistic wellness, permaculture, eco and healthy living.
 Sava, Vlatko and Patricia have spend years as ecological activists in
Montenegro, leading youth and other groups in various activities such as mountaineering
tours, camps, ecological clean-up and planting actions, working with children
and youth and numerous other healthy living activities, as well as citizen
activism.  Thru a series of discussions and brainstorming sessions with
other activists the idea was born to create a eco educo center with
hostel/camping capabilities from a old rural house that Sava and Vlatko have in
the hillside village of Martinici.  Named Highland eco educo center, it
would be a focus for the development of social volunteering, eco school with
education for all age groups, artistic commune retreat, environmental awareness
workshops, healthy living and lifestyle classes (such as yoga, meditation,
etc). </span></p>

<p></p>
<p>The 1st of this kind in Montenegro, this center is surrounded by hills, stunning fruit tree groves, and tranquil fields and forests.  The old house was originally build more then 200 years ago, and is already partially ready for it's new purpose. It is in the historical region of Bjelopavlici, in the central part of Montenegro.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The primary concern and most important part of the project will be focusing on digging a well on the property.  Currently, the house is equipped with two cisterns for household use, technical water which will not be enough once the center gets running. For this important work an engineering and drilling company will be engaged.  </p>
<p>Additionally, Vlatko is well versed on making this property green by using solar thermal and PV panels, grey water recycling, low energy and water use.  This will make this center a self-contained, and with the organic gardening a self-sustainable center. </p>
<p>The 20000 Euro requested will be the total needed to complete the work and get the center ready. All work and progress, and the impact of your investment will be transparently displayed thru pictures and descriptions on our webpage. </p>
<p>Once fund raising is completed, the work will start immediately.  We are planning to start in May 2016 and complete the work by March 2017, to get the center ready for the spring/summer season of 2017.</p>
<p>Throughout the year there will be work to do on the gardens, around the 90000 m2 large property, terracing and cleaning the plots, preparing the camping terrain, outside classroom area, fire pits, planting, building of the greenhouse, etc.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary The Highland eco educo center
started as an idea in the heads of a group nature lovers, activists who are
passionate about holistic wellness, permaculture, eco and healthy living.
 Sava, Vlatko and Patricia have spend years as ecological activists in
Montenegro, leading youth and other groups in various activities such as mountaineering
tours, camps, ecological clean-up and planting actions, working with children
and youth and numerous other healthy living activities, as well as citizen
activism.  Thru a series of discussions and brainstorming sessions with
other activists the idea was born to create a eco educo center with
hostel/camping capabilities from a old rural house that Sava and Vlatko have in
the hillside village of Martinici.  Named Highland eco educo center, it
would be a focus for the development of social volunteering, eco school with
education for all age groups, artistic commune retreat, environmental awareness
workshops, healthy living and lifestyle classes (such as yoga, meditation,
etc). 



The 1st of this kind in Montenegro, this center is surrounded by hills, stunning fruit tree groves, and tranquil fields and forests.  The old house was originally build more then 200 years ago, and is already partially ready for it's new purpose. It is in the historical region of Bjelopavlici, in the central part of Montenegro.


A great base for your trekking and volunteering endeavors through Montenegro. Only 16 km from the capital city of Podgorica.
A close-up satellite view of the building:  https://www.google.com/maps/@42.5481478,19.1753...
In the seemingly inaccessible areas of the rough hillside terrain there are villages of communities all connected and trails throughout the many valleys, ranging from grassy to forest terrain to breath-taking landscapes on the high plateau areas.




Having gathered together the funds to refurbish and renovate the property, we will transform it into a center of creativity, healthy living and environmental education.  The center will also provide hostel and camping accommodation for tours that are traveling thru, groups of all ages who are here on educo camping retreats, and for other reasons. 





How to express the magnitude of your contribution?  This is hard to explain. In this pure country of Montenegro education of this type: healthy and sustainable living practices, permaculture, ecological and environmental education, as well as social volunteering; are very scarce to non existent.  Being able to have a location that will provide education, broaden horizons, be a center for creativity, free thinking and self-development on a very low cost budget will for many (of all ages) be a fist time opportunity to be exposed to such education. 
   What We Need & What You Get Structurally this over 200 year old building is completely sound, and partially already refurbished.  We are in need of finishing work such as tiles, bath room and kitchen accessories and furniture to complete the interior.  The work so far has been done by Sava and Vlatko who are completely able to do most of the work needed themselves.




Needless to say, with most of the work being done by ourselves we are saving significant amount of money needed for contractors and other expertise.  We also have on hand the offered assistance of a number of friends, family and other activist who will provide needed manpower for the project.  

The primary concern and most important part of the project will be focusing on digging a well on the property.  Currently, the house is equipped with two cisterns for household use, technical water which will not be enough once the center gets running. For this important work an engineering and drilling company will be engaged.  
Additionally, Vlatko is well versed on making this property green by using solar thermal and PV panels, grey water recycling, low energy and water use.  This will make this center a self-contained, and with the organic gardening a self-sustainable center. 
The 20000 Euro requested will be the total needed to complete the work and get the center ready. All work and progress, and the impact of your investment will be transparently displayed thru pictures and descriptions on our webpage. 
Once fund raising is completed, the work will start immediately.  We are planning to start in May 2016 and complete the work by March 2017, to get the center ready for the spring/summer season of 2017.
Throughout the year there will be work to do on the gardens, around the 90000 m2 large property, terracing and cleaning the plots, preparing the camping terrain, outside classroom area, fire pits, planting, building of the greenhouse, etc.




The Team
 VLATKO AND SAVA - Run their own taekwondo club, and mountaineering club, and have been active in various ways in their local community and all over Montenegro.  Growing up in a rural setting, both have learned most they need to learn regarding farming and upkeep of land and home. 
SAVA - Is a construction engineer that has specialized in finishing construction work, and all accompanying construction technician knowledge. 


VLATKO - Is a mechanic for machine tools, welder, blacksmith and locksmith.  He is self-educated on solar panels, irrigation systems, other finishing construction work, and plumbing. 
i
PATRICIA - Has a degree in Mathematics and a master degree in Organizational leadership. She has lived in the United States for 19 years and has been a manager/project leader in one capacity or another for over 15 years. She currently is the director of an NGO called ""Our action"" (Nasa akcija) since 2012. The NGO focuses on environmental and heritage protection, leadership and other paradigm breaking education, humanitarian, sustainability and strengthening community work thru developing volunteerism and social activism.



Risks & Challenges
As all construction projects, this one runs the risk of falling behind schedule especially due to financial and/or weather constrains.  There is a possibility to also run over budget. To combat the risk of various delays we have put in a number of measures: 
1. We have given ourselves ample of time for schedule changes so we fall withing our planned opening date. 
2. We have enough workforce flexibility to get more work done and be ahead of schedule on days where weather is good.
3. We have applied for project funding in a number of places to make sure we do not fall short of what we need. Of course, the more funding we are able to secure, the better we can equip our center with all we need for it to function efficiently.
4. We have very carefully planned out needed funding for the project in order to minimalise the risk of going over budget.  
Our team (Sava, Vlatko and Patricia) have a number of large, successful projects under their belt.  The most important actually is our passion for the projects that we choose to get of the ground, because we invest ourselves to the fullest extend.  This is what we plan to do with project Highland eco eduko center which we plan to operate for years to come. 

Other Ways You Can Help
 Other then a financial contribution which are of the out most importance to get the project of the ground, we wish to encourage all who are interested to contact us if they wish to volunteer and assist in the creation of the center, or to get more information and visit the center after opening.  Until we get our website running, we are available at the email nasaakcija@gmail.com ili visit.me@mail.ru, as well as on or facebook page.

the sales of their works would go to three charities Busch Wildlife Sanctuary,
Arthur R. Marshall Foundation & one TBA

The Endangered Florida Species Exhibition will be held at the Paul
Fisher Gallery at 433 Flamingo Drive, West Palm Beach, FL in March 16, 2012. 
 
We feel
that these images will make these endangered species real to the public. We
want these animals off the endangered species list.  The money raised will
help these organizations do more outreach & education to the public.
 
What We Need
& What You Get
We need funding to host this event properly. We
have the expenses of a videographer, a caterer, a bartender, the printing of
the posters, signage & advertising. This is basically what the money raised is going to help finance. See the funding area for your perks.
 
Other Ways You
Can Help

We are in need of a few sponsors.  Restaurants that may be able to sponsor a few
platters a wine sponsor who would be able to sponsor a few cases of wine &
a spirits sponsor who is interested in promoting one or two types of product
from their line. This will help offset costs so we can put the money we earn
here on paying the videographer in full, our bartender & our advertisers. 

Volunteers who can help manage
selling of merchandise at the event .  Must be great
with numbers keeping  track of inventor, handle the spreadsheet
& tally up our totals at the end of the night.  I need at
least 5 people for this.
 

Often when an exhibition is being established,
art work gets stored away until the exhibition date arrives. Anthony’s idea is
to put these creatures in foster care until the actual showcase. The foster
care is basically renting the art. The clients will be temporary parents to
Anthony’s wildlife & hang it on their wall for exhibition in their home or
business until he is ready for the show.  Each piece sells for $3800.00.  The fee of
the foster care is $1500.00.  The foster parents will naturally have
first choice as to whether they want the art work.  If they do, the
difference of $1500.00 will be subtracted from the $3800.00.  WE NEED  FOSTER PARENTS. This is a separate expense.

 We
are also in need to a fiscal sponsor to help finance the printing of each set
of the limited editions of Anthony Burks’ Endangered Series. (100 Ct) The
sponsor who finances this will get 25 of the prints from the series to do what
they wish (fundraisers, giveaways etc.) each one will be Numbered, signed &
stamped by Anthony himself.  Each set is $6000 This
is a separate expense.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h2>Heavens Field- a farm of cooperation in a sea of conflict.</h2>
<h3><em>""The land doesn't belong to us, we belong to the land.""</em></h3>
<p>Israel/Palestine often sparks images of violence and conflict but there are also Palestinians and Jews dreaming and realizing a different future. Whatever political  agreements may be reached- we know that our future on this land is together and its upon us to start working within our communities for a better future. Where we make space for each other- Heavens Field is exactly a space like that- a farm where we recognize and embody that this land is ultimately neither of ours;  our design and farming on the land reflects our understanding of each other as long-term neighbors: perma-culture.</p>
<p>We hope that by our working the land together and hosting inter-cultural work and dialogue sessions we will nurture a future of greater understanding- reducing the fear and violence between our peoples. The money we hope to raise here is literally the seed money to take our planning and investment the next step!</p>
<h3><em><strong>What we envision:</strong></em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Co-run by local Jews and Palestinians, we have spent the past winter working out details, agreements and becoming better friends. We have just harvested the wheat crop on our land, and secured 6 dunam on long term rental for the project. Now it is just the seed money that we need to begin renting this land and dedicating it to our project.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Heavens Field will turn outward - selling our veggies in our local markets - branded for co-existence, supporting local families in need and welcoming volunteers and tourists to this especially holy piece of land.</li>
<li>The land is in a beautiful spring-fed valley between a Palestinian village and Jewish community near Bethlehem. All are welcome here: our community will include an expanding circle of volunteers, and visitors from the region and worldwide.</li>
<li>Heaven's Field Farm gives a physical space to the kind of grass-roots programming we believe in to change violence into understanding. This is one of a number of initiatives our larger communities are doing to increase understanding and cooperation between those perceived as the most natural of enemies. We are partnered with Arabic-Hebrew language learning circles, a joint Israeli Palestinian quarterly journal ""Maktub"", and other non-politically oriented co-existence work; all projects of our sponsoring network- Eretz Shalom (Land of Peace). </li>

I don't know if South Western American youth are ready in the same way, or even know what they are wanting, but we will find out, and we are ready to deliver the inspiring truth of our generation's story. We are the ones we've been waiting for!My StoryWhat really makes me come alive is giving myself and my passions to help the world come together and solve the greatest social, environmental, and spiritual challenges of our time. I get really excited when I think of a thriving, sustainable, just, peaceful global family, living in harmony with the natural world. One global citizenship that loves, shares and cares for each other and the Earth.  

On Feb 14th I am traveling from Guleph On, to Seattle WA, to train to be a facilitator of a workshop called Wake Up! The Wake Up! workshop inspires, empowers, and motivates youth, and I will be giving up everything I have to travel across Canada to make my contribution to the
largest movement in human history, the movement towards a thriving, socially
just, environmentally sustainable, spiritually fulfilling world. 

""Using music, inspiring multimedia, dynamic
group interaction, and engaging dialogue, participants explore the critical
questions facing young people and society today. It leverages the power of our generation’s
narrative by empowering young people to wake up to a clear sense of identity
and purpose, as members of a generation-wide movement for a thriving, just,
sustainable world."" - www.generationwakingup.org
 
My goal is to raise enough funds to get
me to the training in Seattle. After the training I hope to partner with a group of facilitators who are taking the workshop on the road through California. Bus The Change is the name of this campaign and I hope to be the opening act as well as a skilled and engaging facilitator. This will teach me what I need to know and how we can work together to make as blueprint so myself and others can do the same thing and multiply the mobile global change squads that will eventually be in every city and every school in North America...and the World!

I will
write blogs, songs, poetry, and make recordings of the workshops that will be made
available on-line to everyone.
 
The Impact

I intend to work with other youth to creatively activate
the hearts and minds of young people everywhere I go to take action and join the movement of all movements to transform our world. It is my hope that we not just document but collecting data,
and connecting organizations and people in communities across the country that
aim to create a sustainable, just, and thriving world. The worldwide movement is approaching a tipping point. There are millions of environmental and social organizations and hundreds of millions of caring, committed individuals working towards this noble collective goal to spread the word, spread the love, and come together for the good of all. 

Each additional active young human cell will speed up this healing movement and the process towards peace and sustainability exponentially. The end impact is becoming that much more closer to a thriving, just, peaceful, sustainable world. 


*In the off chance that I fall short on my goal, I will take a
bus to Seattle and limit the scope of my project to BC and Southern Ontario for the time being.
Other Ways You Can Help
* Share my music, my spoken word, and my story. Send me love, believe in a better world, seek your passion and do what you love. Come ALIVE! The world needs you to come alive and remember who you really are. You are beautiful & I love you all!

<p>Dive Against Debris Weekend is a 3-day scuba diving event planned with the intent to remove trash from natural reef sites in the upper Florida Keys.  </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p style="""">We are divers, divemasters and scuba instructors who dive daily in the Florida Keys and have witnessed marine debris (trash) piling up on the sites we dive. These sites are also home to over 260 species of tropical fish, dolphins, sea turtles, sharks and other marine life and is the only natural coral reef in North America.  With your support, we are going to clean it up!</p>
<p>By chartering a large commercial diving boat, our objective is to transport a total of 72 divers out to the reefs over a 3-day period for the sole purpose of removing marine trash from the reefs. Once the trash has been collected, sorted and logged, the data will be recorded into the largest online marine debris database in the world through <i>Project Aware</i>.  Not only will this cleanup effort have an immediate positive impact on the reef, but the survey information gathered will also help direct policy and advocacy efforts, aimed at addressing marine debris issues, in the future.</p>
<p>Your contribution will provide us with the necessary funds to pay for the charter boat, fuel and other expenses required to conduct these important clean up dives which will, in turn, profoundly benefit the reef on an immediate and long term basis. </p>

<p><b>Plastic is the ocean's #1 killer!  </b></p>
<p>Every year, millions of pounds of trash finds its way to the oceans. Trash dumped into the ocean not only damages coral reefs, but it poses a serious threat to all kinds of  marine life. </p>
<p>Thousands of fish, marine mammals, invertebrates, reptiles, birds and many coral species are killed every year by plastic bags, fishing line, enormous fishing nets, plastic bottles, car batteries, kitchen appliances, industrial waste and other trash in the ocean. Additionally, not only does ocean trash harm wildlife, but it compromises the health of humans, pressures the livelihoods that depend on a healthy ocean, and it threatens tourism and recreation which help the local economies. </p>

Mark, having lived and taught in the Florida Keys, donates much of his time to marine debris removal in both organized dives and by going out on his own every week either near coastal areas or accosting his friends for their boats to go out with other incredible people. The Dharma Dive Tribe enjoys the camaraderie of being out, removing marine debris and enjoying the phenomena (Dharma) that is diving. Marine debris removal is Mark's favorite type of diving and allows him to dive in places that most never go, something he calls his “Star Trek Dives” (to boldly go where no one has gone before).</p>

What We Need & What You Get

Unfortunately, the trash that is seen dirtying beaches and floating on the ocean’s surface is just the tip of the iceberg. Much more lies unseen beneath the surface and far away on open waters — but that doesn’t make it any less important. 
Most Dive Against Debris events in Florida take place along shorelines and marine piers, which is crucial, but the only way to access the natural reefs, where massive amounts of marine trash is piling up, is by boat.
In order to mobilize our clean up efforts, we need to charter a commercial diving boat that can accommodate at least 12 individual divers plus crew during our Dive Against Debris event.  Your financial contribution will provide us with the necessary funds to acquire this vessel for 3-days. 
Without a boat, it will be impossible to get divers to the natural coral reef areas to clean up - we need your help! 

The Impact



Once the trash has been collected by the divers, it will be sorted and logged and the resulting data will be recorded into Project Aware Foundation's global marine debris database.  Not only will this cleanup endeavor have an immediate positive impact on the reef, but the survey data gathered will further help with policy and advocacy efforts in the future to help reduce marine debris, not just in Florida, but on a global scale.
Your contribution, along with the physical effort from our campaign divers, will help save millions of animals and remove some of the stress that is being forced on North America's natural coral reefs. With your help, we can contribute to the conservancy of coral species such as as the Elk Coral and Staghorn Coral, which were placed on the Endangered Species List in 2006 after 20 years of rapid decline.

If you're interested in diving this event, please contact us!  The dives will be free for diver volunteers and divers must be open-water certified by a recognized agency (e.g., PADI, NAUI, SSI, etc.). In addition to that, divers must bring all of their own equipment, including tanks.  If you need to rent tanks, there are numerous dive shop locations in Key Largo that can provide them to you as long as you present a valid certification card. After the clean up dives are complete, our group has also planned some fun celebratory events that you are welcome to attend. 
Finally, if you or your business would like to donate a prize for our ""after the dive"" raffle, please contact us as well. Anything and everything is greatly appreciated.

Did you know that
half of the world's hospital beds are filled with people suffering from a water
related disease? 
In developing countries, about 80% of
illnesses are linked to poor water and sanitation conditions. 1 out of every 5
deaths under the age of 5 worldwide is due to a water-related disease. 
Clean and safe water is essential to healthy
living. 


We began in Australia and so far have achieved great success improving sewage networks and cleaning wastewater from food processing plants.We now wish to
expand our activities into other industries and in other countries. We have
targeted many problem areas where our organic solutions will provide great
benefit - some of these are in China, some in Africa and others in North
America.
Our Product - Solutek
We developed our
organic solutions by extracting certain components from sustainably harvested,
naturally occurring marine flora – kelp to be exact.
These organic concentrates
do NOT contain ‘live-cell’ bacteria (bio-culture) or enzyme concoctions
and cannot introduce renegade bacteria into anybody’s water system.
They are:
100% bio-degradable

Are user and environmentally safe

Non-hazardous

Non-flammable

Non-corrosive

Solutek does not
just clean industrial and domestic wastewater…
Soil Enhancement:
It is becoming
increasingly evident that beneficial bacteria play a key role in the fertility
of soils and the subsequent performance of crops and plants that produce food.
Solutek, added
to irrigation water at levels of 3-5 parts per million, can act as a stimulant
to help beneficial bacteria reproduce and grow thus improving the fertility of
those irrigated soils.
Quality of Life in small
third-world communities:
Families in
small communities in many developing countries face a lot of difficult
challenges. Solutek can assist in helping those families.
Solutek helps
increase beneficial aerobic bacteria in wastewater thus putting oxygen back
into polluted water and limiting the amount of odour produced by hydrogen
sulphide in anaerobic conditions.
This improvement
in the performance of the local sewage treatment system through increased
oxygen levels allows the community to process sewage more effectively, which in
turn reduces the incidence of disease.

Unfortunately,
we are still spending more money each month than we make as we try to improve
our products further and expand our efforts internationally. 


This is where you can help
Every time our product gets used
somewhere in the world:

We know the outcome will be of benefit to our environment


We know that the water will be cleaner


We know it will be more healthy for people to drink; and

We know that we will be slowly cleaning our natural waterways and ground water.
We want to
raise $500,000. I
know, it sounds a lot - but wherever we tackle a water pollution problem:
We have to begin with expensive laboratory testing of the water and review its environment to determine just how bad the problems are
We need to know what particular pollutants we have to remove
Where the best place will be to apply our products
Then measure the improvements to the wastewater system as we make them so we can teach other people to dose their own system
And all this takes several months
Our products are not expensive but
the establishment of the projects to clean different wastewater problems is.Apart from helping us clean up the world, we want to thank you in a more recognisable
way.
Every dollar we receive will help us improve some community's environment
somewhere: It may be the sanitation and drinking water in a remote African
village; or cleaning the effluent from factories that ends up being poured into
streams and rivers. 
We will
always have a positive impact on the health of people and where they live.

the average kerosene user spends $0.20 on fuel, that will power the lamp for 4
hours. </p>
<p>For low income families $0.20 can mean 10% or 20% of their

We would like to thank you all that supported our campaign
in any way. We
didn’t quite raise enough money to buy the plastic moulding machinery we hoped
to buy, however, we have made the most of the amount we raised; we decided to
try 3d printing, so far we have 3 printers which enables us to make up to 6
items a day, the good thing about 3d printing is that the printers themselves
are relatively cheap, therefore it will be possible to expand our capacity by
buying new 3d printers.






We also bought a filament makers which helped to cut the
cost of filament by 50%.

The advantage of this change is that the new product is slimmer,
lighter, better looking and most importantly requires less handwork than the
old design.

The disadvantage is that the plastic we use,
PLA, is much more expensive than the old plastic which has increased the cost
of production. Once again, many thanks to you all!!!
_____________________________________________________________________Original CampaignWe are Masa Energy, a start up company based in Uganda,
East Africa, and our goal to make affordable solar
products for the millions of people in Africa without
access to electricity.Our first product is a portable solar lantern that is easy
to use and costs just $12, a price that is affordable for most people._______________________________________________________________________The problemWhatever their reasons, African governments have failed in
their duty to provide basic infrastructure such as electricity to the majority
of their population. The situation is such that in many countries less than 1/4
of the population has access to electricity.Source: World BankAs a result, many people, especially in rural areas, still
rely on solutions that their grandparents relied upon, like kerosene lamps.There are many disadvantages to kerosene lamps and here are
some of them:
1. Poor quality of light
As you can see from the pictures above, with kerosene light it’s difficult to see from just one meter away. School children who use them to do homework would have to seat really close to the lamp, which increases their exposure to the hazardous smoke.  2. Pollution Much of the fuel from Kerosene lamps turns into pollutant
smoke. Research has shown that kerosene lamps add up to 3% to global black
carbon emissions.
Source: niehs.nih.gov3. Health risksThe World Bank estimates that breathing kerosene fumes is
the equivalent of smoking two packets of cigarettes a day.
Also from the World bank; two-thirds of adult females with
lung cancer in developing nations are non-smokers. 
Source: BBC4. CostIn Uganda
the average kerosene user spends $0.20 on fuel, that will power the lamp for 4
hours. 
For low income families $0.20 can mean 10% or 20% of their
daily income. And on days when there’s no money to buy the fuel, the whole
family has to go to bed as soon as it gets dark. _______________________________________________________________________Our Solution?We have created a solar lantern that is much, much brighter
than a kerosene lamp.No pollution:It charges under sunlight, stores the energy in its
rechargeable batteries and uses an energy efficient LED bulb. The batteries can
last over 2 years.
Battery life is 12 hours when fully charged; this ensures
that even if the user misses a day of charging, a rainy day for example, there
will still be enough energy for them to use (the average user needs light for 4
hours).And most importantly for the target customer, it’s
cheaper than kerosene use:  The solar lantern costs $12, this is a one off cost and it
comes with a 1 year warranty.
If you compare that to the cost of kerosene fuel,
which is $0.20 per day, you can see that the lantern will pay for itself in
just 60 days. ______________________________________________________________________Why we need your HelpWe currently make these lanterns using the home-made tools
pictured above (You can see the making process
in our video). We had a limited budget from the beginning but felt it was
important to prove the product was feasible before trying to raise capital. We
have proven that the product is feasible but have been unable to raise the
capital we need to buy machinery. 
In Uganda
there are no venture capitalists or angel investors and every bank we’ve spoken
to wants collateral. With this IndieGoGo campaign, we are hoping to raise money to;
Buy plastic moulding machinery
Rent factory space
If we raise enough money, we would also;
Work on a solar mobile phone charger (many customers inquire about this).
Work on a brighter version of our solar lantern.
Hire more people to help us with the work.

</h3></div></div>","""Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."" - Margaret Mead 


LET'S MAKE VANCOUVER FIN FREE 


The movement to protect sharks is growing across Canada and we want to build on the momentum of the shark fin ban in Toronto and launch Fin Free Campaigns in BC. Starting with Vancouver, we will sweep across the lower mainland and then, across Canada. 

There are over 100 restaurants that serve shark fin in Metro Vancouver, making it the second largest Chinese restaurant industry in the continent. Through our Happy Hearts Love Sharks wedding contest, many Chinese wedding couples and consumers have already joined the movement and pledged to not consume shark fin. Now it's time to take this movement to the next level and ban the sale, possession and trade of shark fin in Vancouver, Burnaby, and Richmond. 
We've been garnering support from Vancouver City Councillors and we'll be pushing for a motion to ban shark fin in Vancouver right after the elections and we can do it with your support. 
OUR PLANS FOR A FIN FREE MOVEMENT IN BC

Vancouver ? Burnaby ? Richmond ? Canada 
Vancouver is planning to be the Greenest City in the World by 2020 and starting here, we can launch a movement that would build a foundation for shark fin bans across neighbouring cities, like Burnaby and Richmond. We are also working with a Member of Parliament who is introducing a bill for a national ban on shark fin imports. Having successful municipal bans will build the momentum we need for passing a national ban on imports. 
Referral Contest

IndieGoGo automatically tracks the referrals of contributors, so we are offering a BONUS award to the person(s) with the most referral contributions! Once you contribute any amount - even the minimum of $10 - you could still win the contest by referring the most contributors. 1st place referral prize is everything included in the $1,000 Fin Free Warrior pledge package.
2nd place referral prize is everything included in the $500 Shark Knight pledge package.
It's not hard to win - make the minimum contribution then refer your friends! 


Where Your Money is Going 





Our goal is to fundraise $45,000-$80,000 in total for the 6-12 month campaign. With $18,000 pledged through IndieGoGo, it will contribute a huge portion to jumpstart this campaign. 


Campaign materials (design and production), website design & maintenance, web action tools 
Campaigner (Claudia) to lobby politicians, organizations, liaise with media to keep the issue on high profile 
Volunteer Coordinator to educate and engage constituents, mobilize supporters to take online and in person actions (like petitioning and showing up at committee hearings)
Office and room rentals for volunteer meetings and make the magic happen! 
Travel costs to get to presentations and meetings 

The rest of the campaign funds will be raised through grants and events fundraisers. An Effective Campaign Takes Dedicated People 
Lobbying City Councillors, educating organizations, convincing businesses, mobilizing citizens, organizing volunteers and interviewing with media in English, Cantonese and Mandarin â€“ it takes dedicated people to run an effective and comprehensive campaign to ban the controversial sale of shark fin. Shark Truth is a lean and mean organization and with your support, we can make it happen! Real Results: 10,000. Shark Truth is the only group in Canada that directly engages the Chinese community on shark fin issues through our collaborative and effective campaigns. In just two years, we have convinced 65 couples to pledge to protect sharks and not serve shark fin at their wedding, diverting 10,000 bowls of shark fin from consumption (saving approximately 1,000 sharks). This shows politicians that there are Chinese consumers across the nation that support a Fin Free world. In Toronto, we collected & delivered 10,000 signatures for the shark fin ban motion that passed 38-4 and we've been featured on CBC The National, Globe & Mail and Fairchild Cantonese Radio speaking out for sharks. Let's repeat this success in Vancouver. Other Ways You Can Help Refer a Friend to make Fin Free Vancouver reality!

BACKGROUNDERSharks & Oceans at Risk  | Every year, up to 73 million sharks are killed primarily for their fins, a practice that is not only ecologically destructive, but wasteful. Sharks are top predators and maintain the balance of our ocean ecosystem, something we all depend on. On average, fins make up less than 5% of a sharks total body weight. Due to the high value of their fins and low value for their meat, their fins are often the only thing taken and the rest of their body wasted and dumped overboard. Most popularly served at Chinese wedding banquets, shark fin consumption is threatening the stability and health of our ocean ecosystem. Our Partners | We are working with United Conservationists in a strategic alliance to maximize our efforts. We'll be using their Fin Free branding and tools and we will be carrying out the grassroots organizing and lobbying to get municipal motions passed.

There are minimal risks in terms of competition due to the technologies being implemented, and all the tools would be free for use as web applications, thus further promoting dispersion of knowledge. The main challenges foreseen are:</p> <ul>
<li>Access to data for development of databases : Since this is a niche field, the data required to develop the databases are not available and need to be generated. We are currently generating an exhaustive feature-based database for the birds of India. In order to expand to all the birds of the world, immense effort will have to be put into database generation.</li>
<li>Collaborative work : In order to promote this form of knowledge and data-driven bird conservation, efforts will have to be put into making this available and known to people in developing countries of Africa, South-East Asia and Central America. For this to work out, collaborations with organizations (particularly Audubon societies or equivalent conservation societies) would be necessary to be able to distribute this knowledge</li> </ul>

She provides invaluable support in terms of knowledge about birds, on-field conservation activities, educational bird-watching trips and user interface strategies in order to take the tools we develop to the users who will be actually using them!
Together, we believe we can make a difference!

We do not work alone!

We implement cutting edge technology, through collaborations with esteemed research institutes like University of California Berkeley, IIT Madras, IIT Mandi and IIT Bombay, that aid in census, bird identification and bird conservation as a whole. We believe in developing tools along with partner universities in order to apply the latest technologies and bridging the gap between research and application!




  Risks & Challenges  Since Project AviPulse is a collection of research projects implemented as tools for a social cause, we receive support from several organizations like WWF and BirdLife International for our activities. There are minimal risks in terms of competition due to the technologies being implemented, and all the tools would be free for use as web applications, thus further promoting dispersion of knowledge. The main challenges foreseen are: 
Access to data for development of databases : Since this is a niche field, the data required to develop the databases are not available and need to be generated. We are currently generating an exhaustive feature-based database for the birds of India. In order to expand to all the birds of the world, immense effort will have to be put into database generation.
Collaborative work : In order to promote this form of knowledge and data-driven bird conservation, efforts will have to be put into making this available and known to people in developing countries of Africa, South-East Asia and Central America. For this to work out, collaborations with organizations (particularly Audubon societies or equivalent conservation societies) would be necessary to be able to distribute this knowledge 
  Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot donate to our cause, you can still help us achieve our goals by spreading the word. Project AviPulse is taking one major step ahead in technology towards the cause of bird conservation.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

On December 2nd we will be going to Burma. We are fortunate enough to have been asked to document (via videography and photography) a group that is going to Burma to provide aid to 15 orphanages. These orphanages have been regularly overlooked because of their location and they in desperate need of help. The 'lack' Burma is currently suffering is overwhelming and this project is an effort to provide the necessary supplies needed for these orphanages to continue operating and ultimately continue saving the lives of children. 

The Impact

This campaign will have an unbelievable impact on these orphanages by providing basic necessities that are needed to survive.


We are asking for $15,000. A small amount will go to renting equipment for documenting this project. However, the majority of the money will be divided up and then given to the orphanage to help with the essentials and their individual need.
We are asking for you to donate money and take this opportunity to partner with us. Your donations will purchase water wells, food, bedding, toys and provide a way for each orphanage to support themselves financially once we've left. These are necessities that no child should go without.

Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't donate right now, we thank you for considering our campaign and ask that you share it with others on Facebook, twitter, or any other social media site so that someone else may have the opportunity to give.  

We would also like to thank all of our sponsors involved in donating their time, money and products. Want to thank Fortune Cookie Soap for donating perks too.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The state Amendment and the local Community Bills of Rights that are being enacted are legally binding, and serve to define and enforce local democratic decision making to protect our civil and basic human rights.
Why is the Colorado Community Rights Amendment relevant to people and communities outside of Colorado?

The Colorado Community Rights Amendment directly challenges the long-standing legal power of corporations that are using state level laws to supercede and override community voices. All of the laws being used to sue Colorado communities that have banned fracking, for example, have similar or identical versions in other states. The Colorado Community Rights Amendment will set a nationwide precedent for fighting these corporate laws. We are creating a model that can be used by all other states to protect the health, welfare and safety of their people.

The law passed by over 60% of the vote, and through this campaign Lafayette citizens elected two city councilors that currently stand for community rights and are defending the community vote. Councilor Merrily Mazza is one of these candidates and is featured in our video.
Since that time, the Colorado Community Rights Network has enlisted volunteers in over 20 Colorado cities to build the community rights effort both locally and statewide. In May of 2014, we defeated legal challenges by the Colorado Mining Association against the language of the Colorado Community Rights Amendment, and became the first grassroots group in the state to establish the language of a binding constitutional amendment to concretely challenge and alter corporate power in Colorado.


What are the challenges involved in this organizing?Building a movement that creates concrete, democratic challenges to the laws written on behalf of major industries invariably finds powerful opposition. We are certain to be met with major funding from corporate entities, combative advertising campaigns, and periods where the odds seem stacked against us. However, the same was true during movements for the abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage and civil rights.  




How are we going to overcome these hurdles?

Our expedition is
largely inspired by the proposition of the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline (OFFICIALLY APPROVED JUNE 17th) which poses as a great threat to the pristine wildlife of British Columbia. The
proposition includes a twin pipeline, one carrying
diluted bitumen west from the Alberta tar sands to the port of
Kitimat and the other carrying toxic gas condensate eastward to Alberta. <b>The
combined distance of the proposed twin pipelines equals approximately 2,400km
so we have decided to make it our goal to surpass this distance and bike along
the Pacific Coast to San Diego.</b> The pipeline would cut through the
Rocky Mountains and into the Great Bear Rainforest, crossing more than 800
rivers and threatening the habitats of <span><b><span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">keystone species</a></span></b></span> on land and in water. The pipeline would also bring heavy

routes on earth to ship <b>450 million barrels of oil</b> to Asia
every year. The Great Bear Rainforest is one of the largest remaining

The expenses include transportation, housing and living, and prepaid cell phone costs. Please consider giving – any amount will be extremely helpful for my fundraising efforts.  

Last but not least, help me spread the word! Not just about my project, but also about Cántaro Azul's amazing work in Chiapas! 
 
¿Qué hace Cántaro Azul?
La misión: Cántaro Azul es una organización establecida en Chiapas, México que tiene la misión de mejorar la salud y la calidad de vida de personas que viven en comunidades marginadas.
La visión: La visión de la organización para cinco años es generar soluciones que beneficien de manera significativa y sostenible a más de un millón de personas en México y que contribuyan al enriquecimiento del sector del agua a nivel internacional.

¿Que haré yo?
 Yo trabajaré en algunos proyectos en San Cristóbal de Las Casas y en comunidades rurales en el alrededor.
 1.Yo crearé una estrategia para que Cántaro Azul tenga un impacto profundo en el quisco central de distribución de agua.
 2. Yo trabajaré en desarrollar las actividades que Cántaro Azul hace para educar gente de todas edades en la provisión y manejo del sistema de agua y las ventajas de agua purificada en higiénicas y de la salud.
 3. Yo colaboraré con una compañera en desarrollar e implementar actividades para mujeres en la educación de hábitos de la sanidad.
 
¿Quiere ser compañero conmigo?
¡En primer lugar, gracias por leer acerca de mi plan!
En segundo lugar, una manera en que me podrá ayudar es en el apoyo monetario. Para hacer investigaciones y servir por seis semanas, necesito recaudar $1870.00. Los gastos son para transportación, la vivienda, y los costos del celular. Porf avor considere donar – cualquier cantidad será increíblemente útil para mis esfuerzos de recaudar fondos.

How could we all not share the concerns of the health of our planet and our children? This is easy to say, but its really hard changing wasteful habits. I know, I’ve tried, but feeling guilty about it and making others feel guilty doesn’t change anything. I realized that I can only be responsible for my actions, but I could create a way to change one habit that we all share by providing a way to refill water bottles.

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">My background, 30 years in the entertainment industry, has little bearing on the water distribution industry. However, after years of working as an independent contractor, I realized that I had the skills and experience to create something new that could have a much more positive effect on the planet and all its inhabitants. This desire, to do something meaningful, lead me to sustainability and sustainability lead me to the idea of mobile water stations for refilling water bottles.... and that lead me to the creation of WaterStop Carts. </span></p>
<p>As you can see from the video, we have completed the 1<sup>st</sup> prototype of our mobile water carts. We have created the basic unit with the digital banners for advertising. But there is still much more that needs to be done: Making the overall size smaller, as well as the electronics for wifi, video screen, and app. We need to add a new structure so we can add wheels that will allow the cart to be transported on roads. Making the unit look great will require a very expensive tooling process for the skin, but it is a one time cost. And finally getting the website up to date.</p>
<p>Our interested investors would like to see the final prototype. So completing the next unit is essential to the growth of the company. Without these investors onboard we have a great idea that has been realized, but no company to get it to the public. </p>

<li>The greater portion of the funds raised (total $250,000) will go to the engineering and construction of the second prototype (estimated at $150,000). We have engaged Sigma Design for this stage (sigmadesign.net).</li>

<p>Did you notice the collapsible, reusable bottle in the video with our name printed on it? We will be also selling these bottles along with the carts (venders can replace the money lost on selling bottled water by selling these bottles and offering free water refills, generating good will and return customers.) The bottles are feather weight and small; they can easily fit into a pocket, purse, or backpack and don’t add the extra bulk and weight of a typical reusable bottle. They are BPA free and dishwasher safe and are good for 1,000 opening and closings or about 3 years. They are great for kids (or anyone) to color on or write thier name on… They’re really cool! Unfortunately because of the cost involved in buying them, shipping and hiring someone to do this, the minimum donation to receive 2 bottles is a $500 contribution…sorry, I wish we could afford to get one to every contributor!!</p>

<p><strong>HERE IS MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY:</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align=""center"" class=""Default""><strong>Changing the Way We Consume Water by Creating a New Delivery System:</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">WaterStop Carts is a socially responsible, for-profit company based on the simple proposition that people around the world need safe, accessible and affordable water sources. We seek to address the discrepancy between demand and access by filtering municipal tap water for taste as well as removing impurities. Making it available to the public through our mobile water-carts is our goal.</p>
<p align=""center"" class=""Default"">“<strong><em>Accessibility through Mobility</em></strong><em>”</em></p>
<p class=""Default"">This is the foundation of our thinking. Refilling bottles will save consumers, businesses and governments the extraordinary amount of money spent daily on purchasing and recycling plastic water bottles (The US spent $21.7 billion in 2011). Equally as important our water-carts will help eliminate the daily 60 million plastic bottles (50 billion a year!) that go into our landfills and oceans from the U.S. alone.</p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>Our mobile carts will go where people go, venues of all kinds:</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">Entertainment venues like Disneyland, Concerts and Sports Stadiums,</p>
<p align=""center"">National and Local Parks</p>
<p align=""center"">Golf Courses, <span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Street Fairs etc.</span></p>
<p align=""center""><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Educational Institutions</span></p>
<p align=""center"">Hotels and Conference Spaces</p>
<p align=""center"">City, County and Federal Office Complexes</p>
<p align=""center"">Military Complexes</p>
<p align=""center"">At Airports, carts will be placed beyond the security check points so people can refill their bottles or any drinking container</p>
<p align=""center"">Crisis Management organizations like FEMA and the Red Cross. For these emergency services, carts can be used to replace bottled water and if needed distribute antibiotics in the water.  In third world countries food nutrients can be added to the cleansed water (carts manufactured outside the western world will be made using local materials and resources.)</p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>The Beginning of a Refill Revolution</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">Bottled water is a world wide problem and we fully expect to adapt our carts for the international market. Our first program however is in the U.S. with a leasing and sponsorship program for our under funded schools and universities. In 2010 the US congress mandated that schools provide free water sources to students, but they didn’t address either cost or access, did you know that kids have to buy bottled water in 95% of our schools? Forget about the water fountains that so many of us grew up with!</p>
<p class=""Default"">It is at these educational institutions that the movement toward sustainability is the strongest and the need for clean water is the greatest. In total, there are 112,000 public and private schools. In addition, there are almost 5,000 colleges with a combined total of 77 million students (2012). They comprise 27% of the entire population age 3 and older.</p>
<p class=""Default"">Over the last decade, the drinking water at thousands of schools across the country has been found to contain unsafe levels of lead, pesticides and dozens of other toxins. An Associated Press investigation found that contaminants have surfaced at public and private schools in all 50 states - in small towns and inner cities alike.</p>
<p>Children are especially susceptible to lead and copper exposure because their bodies absorb these metals at higher rates than the average adult. Exposure to high levels of lead can cause damage to the brain, red blood cells, and the kidneys. Exposure to even low levels of lead can cause low IQ, hearing impairment, reduced attention span and poor classroom performance.</p>
<p>States have indicated that they want to increase their efforts in ensuring that school drinking water is safe. However, almost all indicated that such an effort would not be possible for them to carry out in the absence of additional federal funding. WaterStop Carts is the answer, they provide students a supply of clean, tasty water through our sponsored mobile water carts and collapsible reusable water bottles. Mobility allows the carts to be stationed anywhere on campus. Water that has lead or other impurities can be easily decontaminated by changing the standard filter in the back of the unit.</p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>Our Once and Future Customers will be the catalyst of the Refill Revolution:</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">At WaterStop we believe it is the Millennials who will build consumer loyalty, demand and brand for us. Sustainability and Environmental concern is already a major part of this generation’s thinking and way of life. Millennials are referred to as the sustainable generation.</p>
<p class=""Default"">These 77 million students, now in schools across the nation, will take into the future a demand for water refill stations. WaterStop is building a future customer base, insuring the growth of the company, as well as making enormous environmental strides.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">There are many ways you can help besides financial donations! Please pass our request for funding onto all your friends, family and associates. But, equally important, if you have contacts at organizations, that are appropriate for educational institutions, and think they would be interested in sponsoring carts at schools, please let them know about us!  You can do this through this site. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">One more thing...please keep this a secret from the bottled water industy...there not going to like us :)</span></p>

The other perk we can offer will be your name listed under the producer credits on the final video, a position on our permanent founders list, and our heartfelt thanks!
HERE IS MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY:


Changing the Way We Consume Water by Creating a New Delivery System:
WaterStop Carts is a socially responsible, for-profit company based on the simple proposition that people around the world need safe, accessible and affordable water sources. We seek to address the discrepancy between demand and access by filtering municipal tap water for taste as well as removing impurities. Making it available to the public through our mobile water-carts is our goal.
“Accessibility through Mobility”
This is the foundation of our thinking. Refilling bottles will save consumers, businesses and governments the extraordinary amount of money spent daily on purchasing and recycling plastic water bottles (The US spent $21.7 billion in 2011). Equally as important our water-carts will help eliminate the daily 60 million plastic bottles (50 billion a year!) that go into our landfills and oceans from the U.S. alone.
Our mobile carts will go where people go, venues of all kinds:
Entertainment venues like Disneyland, Concerts and Sports Stadiums,
National and Local Parks
Golf Courses, Street Fairs etc.
Educational Institutions
Hotels and Conference Spaces
City, County and Federal Office Complexes
Military Complexes
At Airports, carts will be placed beyond the security check points so people can refill their bottles or any drinking container
Crisis Management organizations like FEMA and the Red Cross. For these emergency services, carts can be used to replace bottled water and if needed distribute antibiotics in the water.  In third world countries food nutrients can be added to the cleansed water (carts manufactured outside the western world will be made using local materials and resources.)
The Beginning of a Refill Revolution:
Bottled water is a world wide problem and we fully expect to adapt our carts for the international market. Our first program however is in the U.S. with a leasing and sponsorship program for our under funded schools and universities. In 2010 the US congress mandated that schools provide free water sources to students, but they didn’t address either cost or access, did you know that kids have to buy bottled water in 95% of our schools? Forget about the water fountains that so many of us grew up with!
It is at these educational institutions that the movement toward sustainability is the strongest and the need for clean water is the greatest. In total, there are 112,000 public and private schools. In addition, there are almost 5,000 colleges with a combined total of 77 million students (2012). They comprise 27% of the entire population age 3 and older.
Over the last decade, the drinking water at thousands of schools across the country has been found to contain unsafe levels of lead, pesticides and dozens of other toxins. An Associated Press investigation found that contaminants have surfaced at public and private schools in all 50 states - in small towns and inner cities alike.
Children are especially susceptible to lead and copper exposure because their bodies absorb these metals at higher rates than the average adult. Exposure to high levels of lead can cause damage to the brain, red blood cells, and the kidneys. Exposure to even low levels of lead can cause low IQ, hearing impairment, reduced attention span and poor classroom performance.
States have indicated that they want to increase their efforts in ensuring that school drinking water is safe. However, almost all indicated that such an effort would not be possible for them to carry out in the absence of additional federal funding. WaterStop Carts is the answer, they provide students a supply of clean, tasty water through our sponsored mobile water carts and collapsible reusable water bottles. Mobility allows the carts to be stationed anywhere on campus. Water that has lead or other impurities can be easily decontaminated by changing the standard filter in the back of the unit.
Our Once and Future Customers will be the catalyst of the Refill Revolution:
At WaterStop we believe it is the Millennials who will build consumer loyalty, demand and brand for us. Sustainability and Environmental concern is already a major part of this generation’s thinking and way of life. Millennials are referred to as the sustainable generation.
These 77 million students, now in schools across the nation, will take into the future a demand for water refill stations. WaterStop is building a future customer base, insuring the growth of the company, as well as making enormous environmental strides.
There are many ways you can help besides financial donations! Please pass our request for funding onto all your friends, family and associates. But, equally important, if you have contacts at organizations, that are appropriate for educational institutions, and think they would be interested in sponsoring carts at schools, please let them know about us!  You can do this through this site. 
One more thing...please keep this a secret from the bottled water industy...there not going to like us :)

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Buritaca river basin, located in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), Department of Magdalena, contains only one of 36 rivers flowing through the local Sierra. Roughly 1.2 million people are dependent upon the freshwater supplied by the SNSM rivers. In 2013, the Sierra was identified as the most irreplaceable bio-region in the world for threatened species. In the aftermath of the Colombian armed conflicts, farmers in the Buritaca basin are thriving at the expense of nature through uncontrolled cattle-ranching, land clearing, poaching, and irresponsible eco-tourism. Environomica sets out to restore ecological corridors by subtracting portions of forest to unrestrained clearing and by reorganizing agriculture in conjunction with the locals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The S.F.E.C. Project has three additional partners to Environomica. ASOTEYUNA (Association of Community Sustainable Tourism) operates for the progress and welfare of the farmer and indigenous families living in the Ciudad Perdida region and will provide coordination with the tour guides in the Sierra. Global Heritage Fund Colombia, who manages the Ciudad Perdida Archaeological Park in partnership with the Colombian Institute for Anthropology and History, will engage the local indigenous and farmer communities as major stakeholders in the project.

This year, with the help of local partners, we have selected two areas in Colombia of critical ecological importance to pilot innovative land management models: by bringing together the people and their environment, we foster a sustainable local economy that will lift villagers out of poverty while protecting their ecosystems.Tree seedlings ready to be planted – Local farmer with indigenous rice harvestIn order to do so we need your help! Project 1 is an alliance with the Global Heritage Fund to restore ecological corridors in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta by subtracting portions of forest to unrestrained clearing and by reorganizing agriculture in conjunction with the locals. Project 2 is a green business model based on reforestation, bioremediation and responsible ecotourism to support household income in the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy. Where does your donation go?We need € 7.800 (50% of total budget) to equip two tree nurseries and two project headquarters, which will pave the way to the success of our projects. We'll keep you up to date with our progress via email and our Facebook page, providing photos of the finished nursery and headquarters.
The impactThe inception of our two projects will generate an appreciable impact. Nursery and headquarters will become the foundations of our forestry projects in Colombia. These preliminary actions will strengthen network ties among project stakeholders and lay down the base for both projects to be majorly funded as to achieve each individual overarching goal.


What is Environomica?We are a group of experts in various fields committed to integrate solutions for the conservation of our planet with local, sustainable development. We started Environomica because we witnessed that neither traditional NGOs nor international agencies or governments had been able to provide solutions that could satisfy the needs of both people and the planet.

Projects Rationale
Our upcoming projects are based on the result of
preliminary need assessments, which have been run in March 2015 by our team.
Both projects will tackle the following issues
with respective strategic actions:

Problem 1: Unstable income sources for the inhabitants of
remote natural areas
Problem 2: Land degradation, forest depletion, and water
course contamination
Problem 3: Lack of
vision for the sustainable management of land, water, and natural  resources

Action 1: FARMING will be
organized to both to feed the community, reduce and OPTIMIZE farmland use, and
generate INCOME via ORGANIC CROPS that can be locally processed and sold
to financially SUPPORT the community and initiative alike.

Action 2: Purchased forestland will be
registered as a “RESERVA NATURAL DE LA SOCIEDAD CIVIL” in order to protect the
mega-diverse forest ecosystems, restore ECOLOGICAL CORRIDORS, and create the
conditions for SCIENTIFIC TEAMS to study and assess biodiversity in the Sierra.

Action 3: On EACH project LOCATION we
will secure FOUR HECTARES of forest as an initial conservation step and equip
the projects with a TREE NURSERY. Nursery and headquarters will become the
foundations of our forestry projects in Colombia. A straightforward nursery
setup powered by our tropical agronomist and engineer, in conjunction with the

<h3>THE GOALS</h3>
<p>With this funding we will be able to get our first production ready for you! With the start of Scoria, you will be bringing more story-telling and imagination to the world. </p>
<p><strong>$15,000 - INVENTORY - <i>UNLOCKED</i></strong></p>
<p>With a little more funding we will be able to 100% guarantee that the first collection will be going in a new Scoria e-commerce store for anyone to be able to purchase</p>
<p><strong>$25,000 - NEW COLLECTION INVOLVING CHILDREN &amp; COMMUNITIES</strong></p>
<p>With around $12,000 more we will be able to fund a new collection that is community involved. </p>
<p>We are aiming to work with children in impoverished communities to inspire them to be artists and give them the ability to become the designers and provide their inspiring stories and scribbles to the world as we give back royalties, financial help, and hands-on help to the children's families and organizations involved directly.</p>
<p>The money will be needed for more research, being able to directly communicate and visit the communities, better communication of ideas to the world, and giving back financially to the children who provided their art and stories to the world. Also, of course a minimum order of inventory for each design to provide the world with the option of having a piece of this collection</p>
<p><strong>$35,000 - NEW LEGGING DESIGNS + WORK ON NEW RECYCLED TEXTILES</strong></p>
<p>If we really over-reach the goal, we will add brand new leggings that you will love, and in darker colours for many who requested that. As we are in a process of even more improvements for the leggings. A lot of the money will go into making the recycled fabrics even better! </p>
<p>We would love to make the fabric better through keeping it soft and have it feel as if it's second-skin as it is right now, however with a thickness that will be harder to recognize that they are made from recycled fabrics. Compared to other brands, our fabric is one of the thickest recycled polyester and has one of the best functionalities, however we aim to work on developing the textile itself to make it even better in its thickness, coverage, comfort and durability! (Aiming high to use/ develop the best recycled fabrics to find in the market)</p>
<p><strong>$42,000 - ADDITION OF SPORT BRA</strong></p>
<p>Ah, don't you just want to spark your imagination from head to toe? We worked a lot in the past year to find a way to add a sports bra that is also made from recycled plastic bottles, however we wanted to keep our commitment to manufacture clothing ethically and in Canada and discovered that it will need to be tackled from scratch with a brand new pattern, more testing and research. An investment will be needed to create a brand new pattern, prototypes and with an aim for optimal quality and functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Future Goal: SCORIA MEN'S </strong></p>
<p>If we reach an even higher funding of $80,000 or more, it's good to dream! We will be adding a first collection for men in terms of clothing/ unisex sweater, tee, and men's active wear/ yoga pants. </p>

<p></p><h3><span>Help us build a spectacular (and safe) hiking trail in the Caucasus</span></h3><p>We are raising money to build a trail between the regions of Svaneti and Racha in the Greater Caucasus mountains of western Georgia. <b>This trail will become a part of the Transcaucasian Trail (TCT), a proposed trail network that will eventually stretch across the Caucasus.</b> The long-distance trail will connect more than two dozen national parks and protected areas in the region, an idea that Der Spiegel has already recommended as one of the <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/wander-urlaub-die-besten-tipps-fuer-2016-a-1070619.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">best new hikes in world</a>.</p><p>Last summer, our team traveled around Georgia scouting routes, collecting data, and building support for the Transcaucasian Trail. This summer, two other members of our team are continuing that scouting effort in Georgia and Armenia. You can follow their adventures here: <a href=""http://www.transcaucasian.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.transcaucasian.com</a></p><p>Now that we’ve done the research and gathered support for our idea, we want to demonstrate what actually building the TCT will look like and how we will do it. <b>The Svaneti-Racha section will serve as our first TCT trail building pilot project.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461610573/2016-camp_hfupx6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Svaneti-Racha trail is a perfect pilot project in many ways. The route will connect two proposed national parks and pass through some of the most stunning landscapes in the Caucasus. It will bring hikers who have discovered Svaneti across the mountains to Racha, which has very little tourism despite its incredible beauty. It will create sustainable economic opportunities for the remote mountain communities in both regions. And this year the Georgian government is working to formalize the creation of Racha National Park, so the trail will provide access to this brand new, and very significant protected area, and help to highlight the importance of its conservation.</p><p>The route we are building this summer between Zeskho, Svaneti and Ghebi, Racha was an established hiking route between these two regions in the past, but the trail is in serious need of rehabilitation and reconstruction. <b>The current route is dangerous and easy to lose, and in places totally non-existent.</b> Fixing it means building tread for the trail, creating safe river crossings, and clearing and marking the path where it has become overgrown. You can read more about the route here: <a href=""http://www.caucasus-trekking.com/blog/svaneti-racha-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.caucasus-trekking.com/blog/svaneti-racha-1</a></p><p><b>This summer our goal is to construct and rehabilitate roughly 40 km of trail, utilizing rotating teams of volunteers working for eight weeks in July and August</b>. The volunteers will be a combination of Georgian and international volunteers. Some are experienced trail builders, but many will be learning the skills it will take to build and maintain the trail in the future.

This trail will become a part of the Transcaucasian Trail (TCT), a proposed trail network that will eventually stretch across the Caucasus. The long-distance trail will connect more than two dozen national parks and protected areas in the region, an idea that Der Spiegel has already recommended as one of the best new hikes in world.Last summer, our team traveled around Georgia scouting routes, collecting data, and building support for the Transcaucasian Trail. This summer, two other members of our team are continuing that scouting effort in Georgia and Armenia. You can follow their adventures here: www.transcaucasian.comNow that we’ve done the research and gathered support for our idea, we want to demonstrate what actually building the TCT will look like and how we will do it. The Svaneti-Racha section will serve as our first TCT trail building pilot project.The Svaneti-Racha trail is a perfect pilot project in many ways. The route will connect two proposed national parks and pass through some of the most stunning landscapes in the Caucasus. It will bring hikers who have discovered Svaneti across the mountains to Racha, which has very little tourism despite its incredible beauty. It will create sustainable economic opportunities for the remote mountain communities in both regions. And this year the Georgian government is working to formalize the creation of Racha National Park, so the trail will provide access to this brand new, and very significant protected area, and help to highlight the importance of its conservation.The route we are building this summer between Zeskho, Svaneti and Ghebi, Racha was an established hiking route between these two regions in the past, but the trail is in serious need of rehabilitation and reconstruction. The current route is dangerous and easy to lose, and in places totally non-existent. Fixing it means building tread for the trail, creating safe river crossings, and clearing and marking the path where it has become overgrown. You can read more about the route here: http://www.caucasus-trekking.com/blog/svaneti-racha-1This summer our goal is to construct and rehabilitate roughly 40 km of trail, utilizing rotating teams of volunteers working for eight weeks in July and August. The volunteers will be a combination of Georgian and international volunteers. Some are experienced trail builders, but many will be learning the skills it will take to build and maintain the trail in the future. This group will form the core of a growing base of trail experts in the region who will help design, build, and maintain the trail rest of the TCT in the coming years.We will be able to cover some of the administrative costs of the program through a generous donation to the TCTA, and contributions of time and effort by our awesome team. But we still need to raise money for some really critical parts of our budget.Here’s what we need:-$3,100 for equipment: This includes trail building equipment like shovels, picks, loppers, axes, a clinometer for measuring the slope of the trail, GPS devices, kitchen equipment for cooking meals, and first-aid kits for the work crews. -$800 for communications: In order to ensure the safety of the volunteer team, we need a satellite messenger and subscription for emergency communications when we are out of cell phone range, as well as two-way radios.-$3,000 for food: We will be feeding 7-8 crew members for 8 weeks. -$2,400 for gas and transportation: We will need at least one support vehicle that can bring the volunteers, supplies, and equipment to the trailhead as well and help the team in case of emergency.

<p>We did it! Our ShellNo BreakFree Kayaktion has officially wrapped, and we accomplished some incredible things.</p>
<div style=""float:right;margin-left:1em;margin-bottom:1em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463704214/beach-banner_e8eqn6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 332.25px;""/></div>
<p><b>First and foremost, Shell Oil and Tesoro were so nervous about being confronted on water and land that they cancelled every single oil train and oil tanker in and out of their refineries for 3 days in Anacortes WA. One of our biggest goals was to impact their operations, and we did that in a huge way!</b> Please give yourselves a big round of applause for helping to make that happen. </p>
<p>Secondly, the Mosquito Fleet couldn’t be more proud of the action we helped pull together this weekend. <b>With tanker traffic already defeated, kayaktivists decided to push the envelope further by landing on the refinery property itself, confronting Shell’s private security forces to send a message to the refinery workers themselves: we are with you, and we want you to be with us.</b> It’s time for workers on both sides of the refinery walls to come together and demand a fair and fast transition to safe energy.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463704305/transition-together_fkraym.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Kayaktivists raised banners on the beach, then held a moment of silence for the victims of Big Oil greed worldwide. </p>
<p>After returning to our launch point (a 6 mile paddle), a few Fleet members launched a second, smaller action to have a little fun with Shell.<b> We took our safety boat back to Shell’s refinery to make something crystal clear: because of us and this incredible collection of badass climate justice groups, this normally bustling hub was completely empty of oil tankers.</b></p><p></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463704376/wheres-tanker-bro_fr22o1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We’re so grateful to you all for supporting the Fleet as we went hard in Anacortes. <b>From here, we’re going to continue to ratchet up the pressure, stopping Shell’s proposed oil train terminal and escalating the call to keep fossil fuels in the ground. We’re also going to dive headfirst into planning an awesome Kayaktion Camp in September to keep building power and spreading kayaktivism far and wide. </b></p>
<p>Thanks again for everything you’ve done.

Huge, huge thanks to all of you for helping to make this thing happen.<div>    <p><b>And thank you to all of our recent donors who helped us shoot past our second stretch goal! We're so honored by your support and continue to be blown away by the momentum and energy of this moment. We're now moving on to our next stretch goal of $25,000!</b> This will help us keep growing the Mosquito Fleet after this weekend is over: we want to seed Fleets in coastal communities all over this bio-region, in the small towns and neighborhoods where the climate movement hasn't  reached, and it takes resources to do the kind of person-to-person outreach we need to make this movement truly robust and representative. We've also started a small repair and maintenance fund so we can keep all the gear you helped provide in shipshape and ready to roll into action. Please keep sharing this fundraiser with your family and friends to help us get there!</p>
<p><b>On a serious note, if you haven't heard already, Shell created yet another environmental disaster this week: a 90,000+ gallon oil spill was discovered in the Gulf of Mexico yesterday. </b>Our thoughts and hearts are with everyone in that community, who have withstood disaster after disaster created by oil companies, political apathy, and corporate greed. The time for a just transition is right now, and you are all helping to bring it to life. Thank you, as always, for everything you're doing.</p>

<h4>Update 3: Let's Make it $20,000</h4>
<p></p>We're gonna run out of ways to say ""Thank you"" at this rate! (Not that we're complaining). Less than 24 hours after announcing our new stretch goal, we shot right past it! We're so, so thankful for and in awe of the response to this campaign. <p></p>

<p><b>The incredible energy on display is just another sign that the tide is turning, and we are winning.</b> Mosquito Fleet is going to throw everything we've got into this action and, after it's over, in growing new Fleets in coastal communities all over the PNW. <b>We're moving to our next stretch goal of $20,000;</b> this will go toward final expenses the action, scholarships for our Kayaktion Camp, and starting a repair and maintenance fund to ensure the longevity of the Fleet and the materials you've so generously given us. </p>
<p>We're packing up our lifejackets and making final adjustments to the kayaks in preparation for this weekend. See you on the high seas!</p>

<p>Thanks to y’all, we’ve officially broken through our $12K goal! We’re super stoked to kick Shell’s butt and show you an awesome action this weekend!</p>

We’ve been buying up used, “arrestable” kayaks, and <b>we got an amazing deal on a used 23-foot sailboat, to be our Kayaktivist Mothership.</b> Thanks to you, this action is gonna rock. <p><b>Some incredibly generous folks have also been hooking us up with half-price life-jackets, discounted rain gear, and VHF radios!</b> We’re blown away by the momentum behind this action and the generosity on display from folks all over the world.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Now that we’ve met our initial goal, it’s time to really crank up this Indiegogo and see what this puppy can do. <b>We’re hereby setting a stretch goal of $15K!</b> This will help us put more courageous kayaktivists out on the water to block Shell’s tankers and speed the transition to clean energy. <b>It will also help us to pull off Kayaktion Camp in September where we’ll train a hundred new Mosquito Fleet paddlers in our creative tactics of swarming against global warming.</b></p>

</div></div>","Update 5: What a Weekend!
We did it! Our ShellNo BreakFree Kayaktion has officially wrapped, and we accomplished some incredible things.

First and foremost, Shell Oil and Tesoro were so nervous about being confronted on water and land that they cancelled every single oil train and oil tanker in and out of their refineries for 3 days in Anacortes WA. One of our biggest goals was to impact their operations, and we did that in a huge way! Please give yourselves a big round of applause for helping to make that happen. 
Secondly, the Mosquito Fleet couldn’t be more proud of the action we helped pull together this weekend. With tanker traffic already defeated, kayaktivists decided to push the envelope further by landing on the refinery property itself, confronting Shell’s private security forces to send a message to the refinery workers themselves: we are with you, and we want you to be with us. It’s time for workers on both sides of the refinery walls to come together and demand a fair and fast transition to safe energy.
Kayaktivists raised banners on the beach, then held a moment of silence for the victims of Big Oil greed worldwide. 
After returning to our launch point (a 6 mile paddle), a few Fleet members launched a second, smaller action to have a little fun with Shell. We took our safety boat back to Shell’s refinery to make something crystal clear: because of us and this incredible collection of badass climate justice groups, this normally bustling hub was completely empty of oil tankers.
We’re so grateful to you all for supporting the Fleet as we went hard in Anacortes. From here, we’re going to continue to ratchet up the pressure, stopping Shell’s proposed oil train terminal and escalating the call to keep fossil fuels in the ground. We’re also going to dive headfirst into planning an awesome Kayaktion Camp in September to keep building power and spreading kayaktivism far and wide. 
Thanks again for everything you’ve done. See you on the high seas!P.S. If you’re receiving a t-shirt or hoodie, please keep watching your email! We’ll be continuing to message folks in the coming couple weeks to get their sizes and design preferences, and we cannot send you your perk without that info. As noted on our page, we expect all our perks to be delivered by the end of June. Thanks again!!--
Update 4: Onward and Upward to $25K!
Greetings from Anacortes, WA! 

The Mosquito Fleet is on the ground at Break Free PNW along with a whole bunch of incredible climate justice groups, and we're stoked to get out on the water to give Shell a little hell. The kayaks, life jackets, and other safety gear you've so generously helped us to get are getting a ton of use already; one of them is about to be used in a training we're leading with Presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein! Huge, huge thanks to all of you for helping to make this thing happen.    And thank you to all of our recent donors who helped us shoot past our second stretch goal! We're so honored by your support and continue to be blown away by the momentum and energy of this moment. We're now moving on to our next stretch goal of $25,000! This will help us keep growing the Mosquito Fleet after this weekend is over: we want to seed Fleets in coastal communities all over this bio-region, in the small towns and neighborhoods where the climate movement hasn't  reached, and it takes resources to do the kind of person-to-person outreach we need to make this movement truly robust and representative. We've also started a small repair and maintenance fund so we can keep all the gear you helped provide in shipshape and ready to roll into action. Please keep sharing this fundraiser with your family and friends to help us get there!
On a serious note, if you haven't heard already, Shell created yet another environmental disaster this week: a 90,000+ gallon oil spill was discovered in the Gulf of Mexico yesterday. Our thoughts and hearts are with everyone in that community, who have withstood disaster after disaster created by oil companies, political apathy, and corporate greed. The time for a just transition is right now, and you are all helping to bring it to life. Thank you, as always, for everything you're doing.
--
Update 3: Let's Make it $20,000
We're gonna run out of ways to say ""Thank you"" at this rate! (Not that we're complaining). Less than 24 hours after announcing our new stretch goal, we shot right past it! We're so, so thankful for and in awe of the response to this campaign. 

The incredible energy on display is just another sign that the tide is turning, and we are winning. Mosquito Fleet is going to throw everything we've got into this action and, after it's over, in growing new Fleets in coastal communities all over the PNW. We're moving to our next stretch goal of $20,000; this will go toward final expenses the action, scholarships for our Kayaktion Camp, and starting a repair and maintenance fund to ensure the longevity of the Fleet and the materials you've so generously given us. 
We're packing up our lifejackets and making final adjustments to the kayaks in preparation for this weekend. See you on the high seas!
--
Update 2: We beat our goal! Now we’re going for $15,000!!

Thanks to y’all, we’ve officially broken through our $12K goal! We’re super stoked to kick Shell’s butt and show you an awesome action this weekend!

We’ve been buying up used, “arrestable” kayaks, and we got an amazing deal on a used 23-foot sailboat, to be our Kayaktivist Mothership. Thanks to you, this action is gonna rock. Some incredibly generous folks have also been hooking us up with half-price life-jackets, discounted rain gear, and VHF radios! We’re blown away by the momentum behind this action and the generosity on display from folks all over the world.


Now that we’ve met our initial goal, it’s time to really crank up this Indiegogo and see what this puppy can do. We’re hereby setting a stretch goal of $15K! This will help us put more courageous kayaktivists out on the water to block Shell’s tankers and speed the transition to clean energy. It will also help us to pull off Kayaktion Camp in September where we’ll train a hundred new Mosquito Fleet paddlers in our creative tactics of swarming against global warming.


So throw down, keep sharing with friends, and get yourself some awesome fleet flair!!
--

Update 1: HOLY COW! We’re more than 95% funded in just five days! 
Thank you to everyone who’s donated, and to everyone who’s written in to offer kayaks, lifejackets, cameras, and more. You all are pure awesomeness! 
We’re now less than two weeks away from our big action and there’s a LOT to do. If we surpass our $12K goal, we’ll be able to get even more people on the water to take a stand against Shell. And every piece of gear we get will stay with the Mosquito Fleet, so if we can really rock this campaign, we'll be set up for future actions too!
So please keep this campaign going! If you can't give, you can help by sharing it with your friends and families. Our team is reaching out to everyone we know, but the Internet is a big place - that means every share is a potential new donation. So share, share, and share some more! 
 Finally, for those who are receiving t-shirts or hoodies, we’ll be reaching out to you starting this week to get your size and design preference, so please keep an eye on your email!

Thanks again to everyone who’s chipped in; you're living proof of how big and real this movement is. Let’s DO this thing!

Bowman and the $13-billion biotech corporation known as Monsanto will open to the Supreme Court.  Monsanto, the multinational producer of pesticide-resistant seeds and known champion of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), has sued Mr. Bowman for $84,000 for purported copyright infringement, that he used their strain of seed without compensation.  Mr. Bowman claims that in seeding his 300 acre soybean farm, he simply purchased second-generation seeds from a nearby grain elevator, property to which Monsanto claims rights.</p>
<p>Monsanto has acknowledged the stakes of this case, which started way back in the 1990s, when their seed sold for about $4.50/bag.  With that price having risen to nearly $18, Mr. Bowman claims that it simply does not make sense for him to have to keep paying such a price for a product that otherwise self-replicates.</p>
<p>Indeed, the implications are huge.  According to Huffington Post, ""more than 50 organizations - from environmental groups to intellectual property experts - as well as the U.S. government, have filed legal briefs hoping to sway the high court.""  If Monsanto wins, as they did in local court against Bowman back in 2010, they are granted more power in an already one-sided battle against nature, as they continue to monopolize agriculture through largely untested genetic modification.  If Vernon Bowman wins, it is a huge statement, telling this corporation that they can't commoditize our food.  So much is at stake, and Vernon Bowman has taken it all on by himself.</p>

<p>This organization has come about because of the helplessness we all feel about the ever increasing price of a gallon of gasoline. As individuals we feel there is nothing we can do about the utter greed of the oil companies. They raise the price of gas very fast on the slightest hint of bad news that “may” have an adverse effect on the oil industry. The media fuels this phenomenon by “preparing” us for the impending rise in gas prices at the pump by “explaining” the reasons behind these events.</p>
<p>Once the alleged “crisis” is over or has subsided, the price of gas is very slow to come back down. More and more of our monthly income is going into our gas tank.</p>
<p>My question is this: How can an oil company report a one billion dollar quarterly profit when supposedly it has been adversely affected by catastrophic events in the Middle East or the effect a hurricane has on its' oil refineries in the gulf of Mexico?</p>
<p>This campaign is important because I believe it represents a very real opportunity to make a difference and to save money at the gas pump. Also, it represents a real chance to “fight back” against rising gas prices and alleviating that feeling of helplessness we all have. If you want to do something about rising gas prices then please contribute to this project.</p>
<p>As a contributor you will help to bring this organization into existence. As a member of  the organization you will be able to take advantage of all of its planned benefits. Such an organization is necessary to provide a vehicle through which we can collectively eradicate that feeling of helplessness and the belief that there is nothing we can do about the rising price of gas.</p>

Whatever amount is raised will be used to initiate the membership marketing plan, secure IRS 501(c)3 non-profit status and develop a membership website. Thihgs will have to move a little slower, but there will be continued development of the organization. It will take longer to reach the initial goal of 300,000 members, but we will get there. The price of gas is only going to continue to rise which only serves to prove that such an organization is sorely needed.</p>
This organization is designed for and dedicated to helping its members save on the cost of gasoline at the pump by utilizing their collective bargaining power. It will negotiate with one national gas station chain to provide a monthly per gallon discount to members. Members will receive a membership card similar to a credit card which they will use at the gas station to save as much as $2.00 per gallon or more each time they buy gas.</div>
<div>
<p>Depending on the amount of gas a member buys each time they fill up, they can realize substantial savings. For instance, if a member averages 30 gallons a week he or she can save $60.00 per week at the $2.00 dollar per gallon savings. That’s an annual savings of $3120. Of course, the more you buy the more you save.</p>
<p>The organization will apply for and receive IRS 501(c)3 non-profit status so that the monthly membership fee paid by members will be tax deductible, thereby providing additional savings to members. Currently, the monthly membership fee is sceduled to be $14.95. Planned future benefits include 1.) providing members with very low fixed rate mortgages (1%) with up to 50 years to repay. 2.) using the collective buying power of members to receive substantial savings and rebates on almost everything members purchase and 3.) helping to reduce the cost of home energy usage.</p>
How many times have you driven up to the gas pump and felt that feeling of helplessness at not being able to do anything about the rising price of gas. Well, now is your chance to do something by being instrumental in helping this organization get off the ground.</div>

<p>Picture courtesy of FreeDigitalPhotos.net</p></div>","This project involves the development of a membership organization dedicated to helping its’ members save money at the gas pump by flexing our collective buying power and negotiating substantial discounts in the price of a gallon of gas at the pump.
This organization has come about because of the helplessness we all feel about the ever increasing price of a gallon of gasoline. As individuals we feel there is nothing we can do about the utter greed of the oil companies. They raise the price of gas very fast on the slightest hint of bad news that “may” have an adverse effect on the oil industry. The media fuels this phenomenon by “preparing” us for the impending rise in gas prices at the pump by “explaining” the reasons behind these events.
Once the alleged “crisis” is over or has subsided, the price of gas is very slow to come back down. More and more of our monthly income is going into our gas tank.
My question is this: How can an oil company report a one billion dollar quarterly profit when supposedly it has been adversely affected by catastrophic events in the Middle East or the effect a hurricane has on its' oil refineries in the gulf of Mexico?
This campaign is important because I believe it represents a very real opportunity to make a difference and to save money at the gas pump. Also, it represents a real chance to “fight back” against rising gas prices and alleviating that feeling of helplessness we all have. If you want to do something about rising gas prices then please contribute to this project.
As a contributor you will help to bring this organization into existence. As a member of  the organization you will be able to take advantage of all of its planned benefits. Such an organization is necessary to provide a vehicle through which we can collectively eradicate that feeling of helplessness and the belief that there is nothing we can do about the rising price of gas.

We require a minimum of $350,000 to
 1.) Conduct a marketing campaign designed to sign up an initial         300,000 members towards our ultimate goal of one million members;
2.) Apply for and receive IRS 501(c)3 non-profit status and;
3.) Develop a membership website.
In exchange for contributing to this project you will receive some exciting perks which include:

Membership in the organization (1 year, 2 year, 3 year, 4 year, 5 year or lifetime depending on the amount contributed)
A certificate for $1000 in grocery coupons (you choose the coupons you want)
A certificate for $1000 in restaurant savings coupons (to popular nationwide restaurants)
3 night hotel accommodations  to any one of over 30 vacation destinations.

If the amount requested is not raised, we will continue to pursue creation of the organization. Whatever amount is raised will be used to initiate the membership marketing plan, secure IRS 501(c)3 non-profit status and develop a membership website. Thihgs will have to move a little slower, but there will be continued development of the organization. It will take longer to reach the initial goal of 300,000 members, but we will get there.

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>Cool Science invites K-12 students to create and submit a visual work of art about climate change. The best entries are placed on posters and placards throughout Lowell’s mass transit system to engage the riding public with informal learning opportunities. In our pilot year, we received over 600 student entries from over 30 schools in Massachusetts. </p>

<p><b>Enrique is pictured standing on his family-run farm</b> situated in
Nicaragua’s most desirable coffee-growing region, referred to as ‘the coffee triangle.’ He has the potential to produce specialty-grade coffee
and nearly double his coffee production. Like many farmers, he has not received formal agricultural training and <b>sells his coffee through middlemen who offer only the lowest wholesale prices. </b>As a result, Enrique  is not able to invest in his farm to improve his productivity.</p>
<p><b>Enrique is eager to learn</b> <b>how to improve
his coffee farm </b>and begin growing other fruits to diversify his income. With
increased sales, he would pay school fees so his three daughters can attend
school.</p>
<br/><h1><b>What will we create?</b></h1>
<p><b>We want every coffee farmer like Enrique to have access</b> to the knowledge and the resources to maximize the productivity of their land, and the opportunity to partner with ethical buyers so they can turn their efforts into income. <b>We want them to reach their own goals:</b> to maintain ownership of their land, educate their children, and control their own futures. To make this possible we will use the $8500 from this campaign to build partnerships with farmers and implement the Project Alianza pilot in Jinotega, Nicaragua.</p>
<p><b>Here is our plan:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Develop a
     mobile education program</b> for up to 25 farmers, with a team of agricultural
     technicians that will visit each individual farm, teaching better ways to
     plant, tend, and market their coffee.</li>
<li>
<b>Improve access to
     farming technologies</b> and promote bio-construction techniques with structures such as rainwater catchment and compost bins. </li>
<li>
<b>Establish a sourcing plan</b> with ecologically and socially conscious coffee companies. We have established a partnership with <a href=""ethicalcoffeechain.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ethical Coffee Chain</a>, to connect farmers to international markets that bring our coffee to you, the consumer. </li>
<li>
<b>Gather information and disseminate best practices</b> through networking and round-table discussions with industry leaders, cooperatives and experienced farmers, about topics such as new technology, diversification techniques, and strategies for improving quality control.</li>
<li>
<b>Continuously measure and evaluate our impact</b> on farming families and communities, and systematically assess our successes and challenges as we move forward.</li>
<li>
<b>Document stories</b> of farmers through photo essays and short videos.</li>
</ul><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/715722/files/20140714023408-IMG_9746.jpg?1405330448"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Jesus invited us to his home in northwest Nicaragua</b>, where he candidly
shared his story of starting his career as a coffee picker, before eventually improving his own coffee farm enough to earn a livable wage from his own land. In 2012, his crop was devastated by a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/business/international/fungus-cripples-coffee-production-across-central-america.html?_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">preventable coffee fungus</a>, and as a result, he lost access to credible buyers and returned to life as a coffee picker.</p>
<br/><p></p><h2><b>Why invest in Project Alianza?</b></h2>
<br/><h3><b>We change lives:</b></h3>
<p><b>Alianza will build a community safety net </b>to create access to agricultural knowledge and resources so farmers like Jesus are less
vulnerable to environmental threats.</p>
<h3><b>We go further:</b></h3>
<p>While small farmer cooperatives and FairTrade certifications have made good progress in improving access to markets, we recognize the limitations of these programs: they can require <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/8107746/Fair-Trade-does-not-help-the-poorest-report-says.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">expensive investments to join</a>, they may be <a href=""http://mro.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/2889/02_whole.pdf?sequence=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">poorly regulated</a>, and they are <a href=""http://www.canunite.org/sites/default/files/Coopepueblos_2008_Smith.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">difficult to access</a> for many of the smallest farmers. In addition, these efforts generally stop short of providing the knowledge and resources necessary to address the long-term challenges of farming families. <b>That's where Alianza comes in</b>: we partner directly with farmers who are in under-served areas and are the most vulnerable to threats such as pest or weather-related productivity loss, or corrupt microlending practices.</p>
<h3><b>We're innovative:</b></h3>
<p>We build stronger communities by promoting partnerships among small farmers and larger more established farms, who often already have the certifications to appeal to conscientious consumers and the distribution channels to reach them. As small farmers develop the resources and know-how to produce coffee at the highest standards of quality, they are also able to gain access to these preferred markets.</p>
<h3><b>We believe in an evidenced-based approach:</b></h3>
<p>Our program is <a href=""http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/pubs/2020/dp/vp42.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">based on research</a> of what techniques are most likely to succeed within the <a href=""http://www.chronicpoverty.org/uploads/publication_files/Tackling%20chronic%20poverty%20webcopy.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">local contexts of the communities</a> we serve. We don't simply provide a higher price or teach a single skill, like better planting techniques. We provide a multi-faceted approach that improves living standards through education, farming resources and access to better markets.</p>
<h3>We recognize the challenges ahead:</h3>
<p>Like any new initiative, there can be unpredictable challenges along the way. We will work hard and our farming partners will have to take a leap a faith, putting in more hours and investing a proportion of their incomes to increase their long-term yields. Building local collaborations and listening to the concerns of our partners will be critical to ensuring program engagement.</p>

Consider
the joy a farmer feels when he is able to send his daughter to school so she
can pursue her dreams.At Project Alianza, this is not only our vision.  It's our business plan. We are asking for your support in launching Project Alianza, a program that offers agricultural education and access to fair markets for coffee farming families in underserved communities, beginning in Jinotega, Nicaragua. 

Enrique is pictured standing on his family-run farm situated in
Nicaragua’s most desirable coffee-growing region, referred to as ‘the coffee triangle.’ He has the potential to produce specialty-grade coffee
and nearly double his coffee production. Like many farmers, he has not received formal agricultural training and sells his coffee through middlemen who offer only the lowest wholesale prices. As a result, Enrique  is not able to invest in his farm to improve his productivity.
Enrique is eager to learn how to improve
his coffee farm and begin growing other fruits to diversify his income. With
increased sales, he would pay school fees so his three daughters can attend
school.
What will we create?
We want every coffee farmer like Enrique to have access to the knowledge and the resources to maximize the productivity of their land, and the opportunity to partner with ethical buyers so they can turn their efforts into income. We want them to reach their own goals: to maintain ownership of their land, educate their children, and control their own futures. To make this possible we will use the $8500 from this campaign to build partnerships with farmers and implement the Project Alianza pilot in Jinotega, Nicaragua.
Here is our plan:


Develop a
     mobile education program for up to 25 farmers, with a team of agricultural
     technicians that will visit each individual farm, teaching better ways to
     plant, tend, and market their coffee.

Improve access to
     farming technologies and promote bio-construction techniques with structures such as rainwater catchment and compost bins. 

Establish a sourcing plan with ecologically and socially conscious coffee companies. We have established a partnership with Ethical Coffee Chain, to connect farmers to international markets that bring our coffee to you, the consumer. 

Gather information and disseminate best practices through networking and round-table discussions with industry leaders, cooperatives and experienced farmers, about topics such as new technology, diversification techniques, and strategies for improving quality control.

Continuously measure and evaluate our impact on farming families and communities, and systematically assess our successes and challenges as we move forward.

Document stories of farmers through photo essays and short videos.

Jesus invited us to his home in northwest Nicaragua, where he candidly
shared his story of starting his career as a coffee picker, before eventually improving his own coffee farm enough to earn a livable wage from his own land. In 2012, his crop was devastated by a preventable coffee fungus, and as a result, he lost access to credible buyers and returned to life as a coffee picker.
Why invest in Project Alianza?
We change lives:
Alianza will build a community safety net to create access to agricultural knowledge and resources so farmers like Jesus are less
vulnerable to environmental threats.
We go further:
While small farmer cooperatives and FairTrade certifications have made good progress in improving access to markets, we recognize the limitations of these programs: they can require expensive investments to join, they may be poorly regulated, and they are difficult to access for many of the smallest farmers. In addition, these efforts generally stop short of providing the knowledge and resources necessary to address the long-term challenges of farming families. That's where Alianza comes in: we partner directly with farmers who are in under-served areas and are the most vulnerable to threats such as pest or weather-related productivity loss, or corrupt microlending practices.
We're innovative:
We build stronger communities by promoting partnerships among small farmers and larger more established farms, who often already have the certifications to appeal to conscientious consumers and the distribution channels to reach them. As small farmers develop the resources and know-how to produce coffee at the highest standards of quality, they are also able to gain access to these preferred markets.
We believe in an evidenced-based approach:
Our program is based on research of what techniques are most likely to succeed within the local contexts of the communities we serve. We don't simply provide a higher price or teach a single skill, like better planting techniques. We provide a multi-faceted approach that improves living standards through education, farming resources and access to better markets.
We recognize the challenges ahead:
Like any new initiative, there can be unpredictable challenges along the way. We will work hard and our farming partners will have to take a leap a faith, putting in more hours and investing a proportion of their incomes to increase their long-term yields. Building local collaborations and listening to the concerns of our partners will be critical to ensuring program engagement.

Kristin, Project Alianza's Cofounder, is pictured above visiting Jesus's coffee and fruit farm in Northern Nicaragua. 

Kristin was so inspired by the potential of this project to improve the lives of farming families, she applied for and received a Fulbright Fellowship to support her efforts. She recently left her job at a global policy research institute in Boston, MA to build Alianza from the ground up in Jinotega, Nicaragua.
Project Alianza has sustained our work through the generosity and efforts of a small but passionate army of volunteers, and now we are turning to Indiegogo to take Alianza to the next level.San Benito flashes a heartwarming smile after a day harvesting coffee. 
Your funds put into action.
Your dollar is an investment in education and sustainability efforts facilitated by our on-the-ground partners. 100% of our earnings go directly to our farming partners. The portion of our funds we don’t raise on indiegogo will have to be raised by other means to support critical programming to change the lives of these farmers.
$25 supports a plot of five coffee plants for up to five years. The coffee plant produces an average of 2 lbs of coffee for up to 30 years!
$100 provides a loan in the form of seed and fertilizer to a family who lacks access to the financing needed to support a small-scale farm.
$950 supports a year of tuition for a coffee farming family to participate in an agricultural education program. Farmers learn about sustainability and experiment with growing techniques which allow them to become rooted in their community.

<p>Growing in a farm, I’ve always loved working outside. My
love for nature flourished in high school when I joined the outdoor club. I got
to hiked several mountains in central Java.</p>
<p>After high school, I went to Northern Arizona to study
biology. Flagstaff and its surrounding were a perfect fit for me. Knowing
little about America, I chose NAU mainly because of its proximity to the Grand
. Here I got to explore not only the Grand Canyon, but also San Francisco Peaks,
Sedona, and the southwest desert.; and I picked up rock climbing. I used the
same criterion when it came to choose the place to continue my study at
Colorado State University in Fort Collins.</p>
<p>My outdoor passion follows me wherever I go. I discovered the
joy of sharing knowledge when I had the privilege to teach climbing at an
indoor gym in Seattle. For six years I introduced people of all ages to rock
climbing; and for six summers I had the honor to take these friends for their
first outdoor climbing experience. </p>
<p>My outdoor activity went off-shore in Seattle. I learned sailing
from the great people at the Center for Wooden Boats in Seattle. The gracious folks
of this wonderful institution let me help out and shared their knowledge with
me. I eventually was able to raise money to buy a 42-yo sailboat. For my last
two years in the States, I had a blast sharing this classic plastic with
friends.</p>
<p>This combination of love for nature and sharing it with others
has led me to this endeavor: to build an ecolodge where people of all ages and
cultures can enjoy an experiential learning in nature conservation.</p>
<p>Upon my return from living in the States for more than 20
years, I met the family of Mr. Sudarli who owns a plot of land on the coast. Mr.
Sudarli is a tireless conservationist. Born and raised in the village of
Purwodadi, Gunung Kidul Regency, he has been working since the 1980s not only
to restore the environment that had been destroyed  since 1960s. His efforts have also empowered
the villagers. The culture for nature conservation that he instilled in the
area has brought sustainable improvements to the village. People have been able
to farm on these karst hills and harvest the timber with minimal impact to
their environment.</p>
<p>The village of Purwodadi, Gunung Kidul Regency, is two hours
away from Yogyakarta, a college town and one of the main tourism destinations
in the country. The land consists of one acre of arable valley, flanked by
relatively steep hills. The overall area is four acres. The valley and some
parts of the hills have been farmed for the past four decades. We want to
return this land into a productive forest by planting fruit trees on the valley
and lumber trees on the hill sides. Once this forest matures, we hope to have
the old spring return to the area. In this forest, we want to build an ecolodge
in the hopes of bringing in an additional economic injection to the area. </p>
<p>There are popular beaches in and around the village. But most
visitors only stay for no more than several hours. This pattern of behavior
only benefits mainly the businesses near those beaches. By having an ecolodge,
guests will stay longer and spend more currency to more businesses.</p>
<p>I hope to attract local and foreign tourists to stay longer
in this area by providing lodging and experiential learning opportunities about
nature conservation in the area. For the local visitors, I will offer an
English camp/retreat to learn and practice their English with a heavy emphasis
on nature. </p>
<p>The lodge will also provide a place to stay for people who
want to explore the numerous caves in the area and climb at a nearby popular
climbing spot, Siung Beach. This area has other places where there are
undeveloped limestone cliffs boulders within 30 minute walking distance from
the lodge.</p>
<p>This fund will be used to build an ecolodge facility that will
be the first of its kind in the area. It is the natural next step on the process
of empowering the locals. We hope to use the ecolodge to provide a new model
for a small scale/family run business.</p>
<p>We do not plan to build a mega resort. We have put an upper
limit of a 20-guest capacity for our facility. We will scrutinize every
possible impact, record every step and share what we learn to the guests
directly and general public on our website.  We will also share our knowledge to the
villagers or anyone to start their own ecolodges if there is indeed a demand
for such a venture in the area. Mr. Sudarli is also an instructor at the local
community college (Universitas Gunung Kidul – UGK) teaching conservation. We
hope to develop an academic cooperation with UGK and may eventually start a
curriculum on ecotourism using what we learn from our ecolodge.</p>
<p>We need US$8050 to build the commons, five cabins, one
kitchen, two shower stalls, two composting toilets, water supply and rainwater
catchment systems, solar power system, fruit tree saplings, and marketing
materials.</p>
<p>The following prices of items include the cost of materials,
labor, transport and indiegogo fee.</p>
<p>We will build one Commons building , 3 by 6 m2, which costs $750.
We plan to spend $400 to build a kitchen and furnish it with smokeless biomass
stoves and storage cabinets.The cabins will cost $300 each and we want to build
five of them. The kitchen and cabins are 3x3 m2. All buildings are made of
bamboo and thatched roofs. Wash sinks are available in all buildings.</p>
<p>There will be two shower stalls ($100 each)  and two composting toilets ($125 each).</p>
<p>To supply the place with water, initially we will connect to
an existing pipeline that supplies water to the valley below from a spring, two
kilometers away. We are required to obtain a 5-HP water pump that costs $500,
build a storage house for it that will cost an additional $250, and get additional
pipes for $150 to complete this project. This pump will deliver the water to one
1200 L tank on our property that will be placed higher than the buildings for
gravity-fed plumbing system. </p>
<p>We do not plan to solely rely on the above system. We will
also place one 1200 L tank to collect rainwater from each cabin and the kitchen
and one 5500 L water tank for the commons. In total, we will need seven 1200 L
tanks ($150/tank) and one 5500 L tank ($750) for rainwater catchment. </p>
<p>The farm is off the grid, so we want to install a solar-power
system. We want to start with a 100-watt system to fill the need for lighting
and charging. But eventually we want to add more power for refrigeration, water
pumping, other electrical equipments that we may need. A 100-W system will be a
good start for a modular expansion. This initial need will cost us $1500.</p>
<p>To start the planting, we will get saplings from reputable
nurseries in and around Gunung Kidul Regency. In the first year, we will
concentrate on planting fruit trees on the upper half of the valley. For every
fruit tree, we will plant five supporting trees and ground covers. These
supporting trees are nitrogen-fixing trees. We hope to plant the whole valley
with fruit trees by the end of second year. Ground covers will also be planted
to reduce water evaporation, increase fertility and provide a source for
vegetables. We expect to spend $300 on planting.</p>
<p>To market the ecolodge, we will need $500 to start. We will
use print and electronic media, and visit to institutions to promote our ecolodge
and educational programs. </p>

we will designate a hut or a plot of garden with your name.</p>
<p>Each donation will be a part of our facilities and last for
as long as our facilities exist. We will send you a picture of your plant or

<p>The main infrastructure that has to be present is the water
supply system.  We will build this first.
Having a reliable water source in our property will allow us to live on the
land and start the project full time.</p>
<p>Water is also a necessity to start building the structures. The
first building that we need is the Commons. We can use the building not only as
the classroom, but also lodging for our instructional programs. There are two
huts already available in the farm that can be used as the kitchen and storage.
</p>
<p>One shower stall and one composting toilet will be the additional
structures to have the to kickstart our venture.</p>
<p>Our overarching goals are nature conservancy and education.
This ecolodge will provide a place to develop a sustainable business model for this
area specifically and contribute to ecotourism in general. This ecolodge will
offer a more responsible alternative to the conventional tourism for those who
love to travel.</p>
<p>We have a living Business Plan, which contains the details
of our plans, on our website. To continually improve our business practices, we
will update this plan when necessary. We will also welcome and respond
accordingly to all criticisms and suggestions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Bob O'Hara, and I have been a solar technician in New Orleans, Louisiana for nearly 5 years.  Upon returning to New Orleans in 2008, I began working in the solar industry on various renewable energy projects throughout Louisiana.  </p>
<p>In the summer of 2009, I noticed that there was an uninstalled Solar Hot Water system sitting in the warehouse which houses the Lower 9th Ward Village Center, a community organization which works to bring back homeowners to the 9th Ward and assist in the rebuilding of the neighborhood, which was devasted by Hurricane Katrina.  </p>
<p>I took it upon myself to attempt to get this system installed for the organization, as they had limited funds to pay for the extra equipment and labor required to make the system operational, and the original contractor was unable to install the system due to a debilitating illness.</p>
<p>In 2011, several solar companies came together to install half of the Solar Hot Water system, pictured above.  </p>
<p>Today, this same group, GSREIA (Gulf States Renewable Energy Industries Assocation (<a href=""http://www.gsreia.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gsreia.org</a>) is poised to finish the installation in June.  This event will coincide with Solar Day 2013, which will be June 29, 2013, but we need funds in order to pay for the extra materials we need to complete the project.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
My name is Bob O'Hara, and I have been a solar technician in New Orleans, Louisiana for nearly 5 years.  Upon returning to New Orleans in 2008, I began working in the solar industry on various renewable energy projects throughout Louisiana.  
In the summer of 2009, I noticed that there was an uninstalled Solar Hot Water system sitting in the warehouse which houses the Lower 9th Ward Village Center, a community organization which works to bring back homeowners to the 9th Ward and assist in the rebuilding of the neighborhood, which was devasted by Hurricane Katrina.  
I took it upon myself to attempt to get this system installed for the organization, as they had limited funds to pay for the extra equipment and labor required to make the system operational, and the original contractor was unable to install the system due to a debilitating illness.
In 2011, several solar companies came together to install half of the Solar Hot Water system, pictured above.  
Today, this same group, GSREIA (Gulf States Renewable Energy Industries Assocation (www.gsreia.org) is poised to finish the installation in June.  This event will coincide with Solar Day 2013, which will be June 29, 2013, but we need funds in order to pay for the extra materials we need to complete the project.
 


What We Need & What You Get
We need:

$750+ for copper tubing, fittings, valves
$500+ for racking to mount the 3 remaining solar collectors
$400-500 for possible replacement of drainback solar water tank
$500-750 for plumbing and commissioning of system 

For your support of $25 or more, you get a solar site assessment of your home in Louisiana from Joule Solar Energy, personally done by Bob O'Hara.  I'll provide you with the information you need to put solar electric and/or solar hot water on your home!
The Benefits and Impact:

Solar Hot Water is available to the 9th Ward Village/Lil Wayne Skate Park, allowing the organization to save money on its energy bills each month.
The Lower 9th Ward Village can continue to benefit the Lower 9th Ward in its operations and assist in the rebuilding of the neighborhood.
All funds generated will be going towards finishing this solar installation, providing the 9th Ward Village/Lil Wayne Skate Park with greater financial, environmental, and social benefits.
This organization has a solar electric system installed on its grounds, and with the addition of a solar hot water system, the facility will be able to operate more independently, lowering the financial burden to the organization and decreasing its carbon footprint.
Within the last month, Bob O'Hara and another Joule solar technician taught a solar installation class in Vermont, in which 12 inexperienced students completed a fully operational solar electric system for a client in 5 days.  This solar hot water project can be completed and working in a short period of time with your help.
GSREIA also has a track record of positive community involvement, advancing the cause of renewable energy in communities throughout the Gulf South, and in its home, New Orleans, Louisiana.
This installation will provide an example to the community, showing that renewable energy is within the reach of everyone.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> Hi everybody! My name is Stephanie Arcusa, I am a junior student from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I have two passions in life. The first one is to travel, and that I have covered extensively within Europe but this will be my first time in South America. I am so excited! I bet it's wonderful :) My second passion, and the one which is driving me forward, is the environment. I am currently studying Geosciences which is a mix of geography and geology for those who don't know :) It's incredibly challenging and exciting because the Earth cannot speak, it cannot tell us where she hurts or how she feels. In recent times we've all heard too many environmental disasters happening around the world. Some in distant lands, others much closer to home. It is time to take action I say, before the Earth has had ENOUGH! <br/><br/>This May 2012, I am therefore volunteering in Ecuador with a non-profit, U.S. based organisation called International Student Volunteers (ISV). I will take part in an exciting and educational four week environmental conservation program where I will participate with several other students, in hands-on world saving! I will replant native trees where deforestation has occurred, I will teach children about caring for the environment, I will help set up recycling programs as well as encouraging the local people to farm sustainably and organically. I will work towards making Ecuador a sustainable economy where natives and the environment alike can live in harmony and prosper. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As of July 2011, Ecuador has a population of over 15 million people. 
Local people rely heavily on the land to survive as well as to export. 
As a result deforestation and pollution are widespread which in turn is 
affecting the population. ISV volunteers talk to local people about 
sustainable organic farming in an attempt to conserve Ecuador's natural 
resources. iSV volunteers also set up recycling programs to make sure 
the environment is not degraded and to cut down on waste. Also 
important, ISV volunteers help Ecuador become an eco-tourism world 
destination providing a sustainable future to its population.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Ecuador is the home of a part of the Amazon rain forest, a forest full of rare and exotic plant and animal species. Many of which are used by Northern countries to make pharmaceutical drugs such as Quinine from the cinchona tree which is used to treat malaria. Apparently, less than 5% of the species have been analysed for their chemical compounds and medicinal value. Deforestation is destroying our chance to find a cure for cancer! By supporting this cause you will give chemists more time to discover the wonders of the Ecuadorian rainforest. You will also make sure species such as the Golden Mantled Tamarin and the White Bellied Spider monkey keep their home. In the past year ISV volunteers have planted over 3000 native trees.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Something you might not have thought of: the rainforest is a key area in terms of climate, it helps regulating it by absorbing CO2. Deforestation not only removes carbon sinks but also releases more CO2 into the atmosphere as machines work through the forest. By supporting this cause you will make sure the situation with climate change will not become worse than it already is.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Ecuador is also home to mangrove forests which have despairingly been cut down to almost 10%. Mangroves are really useful to the local population as well as for the world's oceans. Mangroves provide erosion control as well as the nutrients necessary for the oceanic food chain. They are also home to hundreds of animal species many of which are sustenance to local fisheries. Mangroves also have the ability to purify water by replenishing it in oxygen. By supporting this cause you will ensure that deforested areas will be replanted thus sustaining local populations as well as the global food chain. In the past year, ISV volunteers have planted 10,700 seeds. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By supporting this cause you will help ensure Ecuador's people have a sustainable future, that the world's oceans keep receiving a plentiful supply of nutrients, that the rainforest remains intact for its beauty and for the species living in it and finally that every attempt is made to keep climate change under control.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Well folks, here's the deal. This volunteering trip will cost approximately $6000 dollars. This includes accommodation, meals, project material and support, ground transportation and tour guidance. I am aiming to raise $1000 or more through this website as I have other fundraising activities going on elsewhere. For example, donations from friends and family, donations from the very generous local businesses and a soon to happen raffle. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What you get from this is, first of all, the sense that you are making a difference in the world because you know that this organisation DOES make a difference. Second, you become a philanthropist, the most generous and self-less type of human being on Earth. Third, you get a reward :D<br/></p>

I.T. Athens is an all-volunteer 501c3 non-profit institution founded
in 2005.  Our mission is to reduce e-waste, promote technology
re-use, help
close the digital divide, offer technology education, and advocate for free software and open
alternatives. Since its founding in 2005, Free I.T. Athens has diverted more than 100 tons of 
unusable equipment from landfills.  Subsequently, we have been able to distribute over 2,500 refurbished
 computers to individuals, community groups, churches, and non-profits in 
Cameroon, El Salvador, Peru, and the United States. Since January of 2015, we have distributed over 300 recycled computers to individuals and
    families in need. In the same time period, we have distributed over 60 computers to community groups and nonprofit
    organizations in Athens (and as far as the Russian Federation),
    working in the impact areas of domestic violence, mental health,
    homelessness, education, mediation, public health and HIV/AIDs.Free I.T. Athens
accepts and collects unwanted computer-related materials.
sorts, refurbishes, or responsibly recycles unwanted equipment.
manages a volunteer base of support, training them in GNU/Linux, hardware refurbishing, customer service, and basic management. (Volunteers are rewarded with a refurbished computer after 30 hours of service.)

teaches public training classes in GNU/Linux, freely licensed software, Creative Commons, etc.

fulfills equipment grant requests for non-profits and start-ups.
offers donation-based tech support to the community at-large.
sells refurbished computers and parts.

Now, as we celebrate our 10th anniversary, we are confronted
with a larger donation base than our founders could have imagined or anticipated. We are asking for $5000 so that we can 
purchase a used vehicle.
pay the necessary insurance.
create a fuel fund.
create a parts fund in case of repairs. (We have the labor covered!)

In
order to meet the growing needs of Free I.T. Athens' donors and clients, we need a pick-up truck. Volunteers making multiple trips to pick up donations in their cars is becoming less and less sustainable and unnecessarily increases our carbon footprint.  Please help by making whatever tax-deductible donation is comfortable for you. The perks are so amazing that you'll probably want to tell your friends. Please do because....we need a truck!

perennial fruit in their front yards and along the sidewalks for their neighbors to enjoy. </p>
<p>It’s about generosity and connection among neighbors.  It’s about growing in appreciation of the

of a couple dozen fruit trees, a few dozen perennial herbs, and hundreds and

will be able to offer fruit trees and berries to lower income neighbors for
free.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Administered by the Chosewood Park Community Development

<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>With the $2800 requested we will multiply the plantings that are
already done, and provide fresh fruit to all the neighbors in this ethnically
and income diverse neighborhood.  </p>
<p>Your contribution pays for a healthy plant to be planted by
volunteers.  But it also provides a very
small amount to pay an under-employed neighbor to keep the plants watered
through hot, dry July and August.  We
will also bring in an orchard expert to conduct free workshops on care and
pruning of the varieties planted.  5% of
the funds will be used to spread the concept and to initiate the next Edible
Neighborhood.</p>
<p>If we raise less than the target goal:  all of the funds will be used to plant all the
fruit we can.  If we fall far short of
the goal, then the Orchard expert will not get an honorarium for our workshops.  Underfunding will reduce our reach in
spreading the concept of Edible Neighborhood and of course, Indiegogo takes a
larger share (6% instead of 3%) for the service.</p>

<p>And literally across generations.  Fruit trees planted this year will be bearing
fruit until 2040 and beyond. This is growing resilience for a community.</p>
<p>But beyond this neighborhood, Edible Neighborhood will be
established as recognized, reproducible program that can be taken to
neighborhoods everywhere.  5% of the
funds we collect will be used to promote the concept of Edible Neighborhood to
community gardens, neighborhood associations, and community development
organizations through social media and providing how-to guides for free.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can
Help</b></p>
<p>Is Edible Neighborhood a good concept?  If you believe it is, then please share this
program with your community of friends. 
Like and Share the Facebook page. 
If you are so moved, then we would be very glad to have your donation of
a tree, bush, or herb.  But in any case,
please do share the idea.</p>
<p>What happens if we encourage, “invision”, communities to make
edible landscapes a part of what draws them together and brings them delight? </p>
<p>The concept of the Edible Neighborhood focuses on cultivating edible perennials that are
located so neighbors have easy access to the plants. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This is a community development project that is very effective
financially.  A small investment will
provide returns of food and community for decades.</span></p>

hundreds of edible flowers. Those plantings are doing well.  And with the additional plantings here we
will be able to offer fruit trees and berries to lower income neighbors for
free.  
Administered by the Chosewood Park Community Development
Corporation, your donation is tax deductible.  This program is guided by Clay Preston and
Greg Ramsey, architects and planners who each have 15 years of experience
designing sustainable communities that incorporate organic farms in every
project.  Their assistance is donated.A fig tree 8 months after planting
What We Need &
What You Get
With the $2800 requested we will multiply the plantings that are
already done, and provide fresh fruit to all the neighbors in this ethnically
and income diverse neighborhood.  
Your contribution pays for a healthy plant to be planted by
volunteers.  But it also provides a very
small amount to pay an under-employed neighbor to keep the plants watered
through hot, dry July and August.  We
will also bring in an orchard expert to conduct free workshops on care and
pruning of the varieties planted.  5% of
the funds will be used to spread the concept and to initiate the next Edible
Neighborhood.
If we raise less than the target goal:  all of the funds will be used to plant all the
fruit we can.  If we fall far short of
the goal, then the Orchard expert will not get an honorarium for our workshops.  Underfunding will reduce our reach in
spreading the concept of Edible Neighborhood and of course, Indiegogo takes a
larger share (6% instead of 3%) for the service.
The Impact
This is a map of the actual plantings to date.  Your plant will be mapped, and your name included in the metadata on the map marker.  View Chosewood NOW Plantings in a larger mapBonds of friendship are harvested when gathering together to pick apples, plums, figs, and other fruit; connection to the Earth and
her seasons; delight for the senses and connection across generations.
And literally across generations.  Fruit trees planted this year will be bearing
fruit until 2040 and beyond. This is growing resilience for a community.
But beyond this neighborhood, Edible Neighborhood will be
established as recognized, reproducible program that can be taken to
neighborhoods everywhere.  5% of the
funds we collect will be used to promote the concept of Edible Neighborhood to
community gardens, neighborhood associations, and community development
organizations through social media and providing how-to guides for free.
Other Ways You Can
Help
Is Edible Neighborhood a good concept?  If you believe it is, then please share this
program with your community of friends. 
Like and Share the Facebook page. 
If you are so moved, then we would be very glad to have your donation of
a tree, bush, or herb.  But in any case,
please do share the idea.
What happens if we encourage, “invision”, communities to make
edible landscapes a part of what draws them together and brings them delight? 
The concept of the Edible Neighborhood focuses on cultivating edible perennials that are
located so neighbors have easy access to the plants. This is a community development project that is very effective
financially.  A small investment will
provide returns of food and community for decades.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><div>My name is Harshita Pilla, and I'm the team lead for the Tibetan Village Project at Berkeley. I'm currently a second year, Civil and Environmental Engineering undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm personally very interested in the importance of sustainable design in our future, which is why I've chosen to take this project on. Thank you for visiting this page, and if you have any questions, feel free to personally email me at harshita.pilla@berkeley.edu. </div>
<div>
<br/><b>Who's the Tibetan Village at Berkeley?</b><br/>We're a group of students who have been working this past year to attempt to combat the waste management issues in rural Tibet.

My name is Harshita Pilla, and I'm the team lead for the Tibetan Village Project at Berkeley. I'm currently a second year, Civil and Environmental Engineering undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm personally very interested in the importance of sustainable design in our future, which is why I've chosen to take this project on. Thank you for visiting this page, and if you have any questions, feel free to personally email me at harshita.pilla@berkeley.edu. 

Who's the Tibetan Village at Berkeley?We're a group of students who have been working this past year to attempt to combat the waste management issues in rural Tibet.

<p>Students from a graduate school in California will be traveling to Colombia to assist Misión Gaia, a non- profit organization dedicated to the development of sustainable tourism in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia to develop a long-term business plan. This business plan will help Misión Gaia ensure that tourism in the region doesn't create more ecological problems and social disparities, but instead trains and empowers the local community to manage their own businesses and protect the environment. </p>
<p>One of the ways that they are doing this is through a birdwatching program that allows tourists to experience the unique biodiversity of the region. The animal and plant life in the area is worth more to this community if it is intact--unlike  other ecologically devastating economic activities that are common in the region, like logging or mining. This also offers the community a long term source of income that will allow them to invest in schools, medical centers and more businesses that generate wealth and protect their irreplaceable natural resources. The tour guides are trained and the business is ready to go-- they just need a little bit of help. </p>
<p>They don't have the money for the binoculars. They aren't asking for any cash or long-term investments, they are asking for help buying the binoculars that they need so that they can begin their exciting journey as entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>Returns on the investment will have a much greater impact than you could ever imagine: you'll be part of a movement that lifts local communities out of poverty, protects unique and threatened species and allows tourists from all over the world to learn about Colombia's flora and fauna!</p>
<b>Binoculars Needed for Community Based Ecotourism in Minca,

<p>As a part of our efforts to build capacity and develop new
strategies for ecotourism, we are utilizing participatory planning to steer our
burgeoning tourism market towards ecotourism that benefits the local community,
local economy and protects our unique natural environment.  </p>
<p>As Minca's
tourism has increased by 33% in the last two years, we feel it is now more
important than ever to be prepared for this change by providing nature tourism
technical training programs to community members.  With generous support
from Eco turs and the
PROAVES Foundation we have been able to deliver the first theoretical and
practical training for youth bird watching, a training consisting of 60 field
hours.  We work in an area with more than 600 species of birds (including
20 endemic species) that is also a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.  We still
do not have binoculars, which would allow the group to apply its newly acquired
knowledge.  </p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</b><br/></p>
<p>In order to purchase high quality birding binoculars for our bird watching graduates, we are aiming to raise $6,000.  Each pair of high quality binoculars (Eagle Optics, Ranger 10x42) costs $309.99.  We are aiming to raise enough money to purchase 20 pairs.  15 of these pairs will support graduates of the recent bird watching guiding training, while the remaining five pairs will be reserved for the next round of community training.  If we do not meet our overall funding goal, all money raised will go directly towards the purchasing of the number of binoculars the funds will support.</p>

</h3> <p>A fragile ecosystem sits in the midst of concrete buildings in Nairobi. It is an ecological haven stretching over 10 acres of land, with unique tree, plant and bird species, and it is a source of income for an estimated 300 plant and pot sellers 
in the area. <br/></p>
<p>For many years, renowned Kenyan environmental activist and 2004 Nobel Peace 
Prize winner, the late Professor Wangari Maathai, fought to protect this wetland from powerful developers, and she succeeded. <br/></p>
<p>Now, 3 years after her death, the Presbyterian Church of East Africa has plans to turn the wetland into luxury apartments. Not only is this a disgrace to Professor Maathai's decades of work, but it will also destroy the trees, the birds and the livelihoods of the people who depend on the wetland.</p>
<p>The plan to build apartments contravenes findings by the National Environmental 
Management Authority that no construction should occur on a wetland, as well as a consultation in 2010 which found that members of 
the public were strongly against the development. A 2001 Environmental Impact Assessment by a geographer from the 
University of Nairobi found that developing the land could result in Kibagare river flooding into informal settlements such as Mathare. <br/></p>
<p>We are a group of activists and environmental groups, including the Centre for Environmental Action and the Coalition for Constitution Implementation. We have been campaigning to protect the wetland for several months, but so far, construction has started and no action has been taken either by the government or by others tasked with protecting such areas in Kenya. <br/></p>
<p>We want to file a case in court and we have a lawyer, but we need funds to cover his legal fees and the costs of filing the case. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>As we all know, court cases are expensive affairs. We are aiming to raise $3000. All this money will go toward the court case. This will include the lawyer's fees of approximately $1500, filing fees of $1000 and $500 for documentation. <br/>
</li>
<li>Any outstanding amount will go toward the campaign we are building - to inform people about Kibagare and other wetlands under threat and to raise the profile and urgency of the issue. <br/>

</div></div>","Protecting Kibagare
 A fragile ecosystem sits in the midst of concrete buildings in Nairobi. It is an ecological haven stretching over 10 acres of land, with unique tree, plant and bird species, and it is a source of income for an estimated 300 plant and pot sellers 
in the area. 
For many years, renowned Kenyan environmental activist and 2004 Nobel Peace 
Prize winner, the late Professor Wangari Maathai, fought to protect this wetland from powerful developers, and she succeeded. 
Now, 3 years after her death, the Presbyterian Church of East Africa has plans to turn the wetland into luxury apartments. Not only is this a disgrace to Professor Maathai's decades of work, but it will also destroy the trees, the birds and the livelihoods of the people who depend on the wetland.
The plan to build apartments contravenes findings by the National Environmental 
Management Authority that no construction should occur on a wetland, as well as a consultation in 2010 which found that members of 
the public were strongly against the development. A 2001 Environmental Impact Assessment by a geographer from the 
University of Nairobi found that developing the land could result in Kibagare river flooding into informal settlements such as Mathare. 
We are a group of activists and environmental groups, including the Centre for Environmental Action and the Coalition for Constitution Implementation. We have been campaigning to protect the wetland for several months, but so far, construction has started and no action has been taken either by the government or by others tasked with protecting such areas in Kenya. 
We want to file a case in court and we have a lawyer, but we need funds to cover his legal fees and the costs of filing the case. 
  What We Need & What You Get 
As we all know, court cases are expensive affairs. We are aiming to raise $3000. All this money will go toward the court case. This will include the lawyer's fees of approximately $1500, filing fees of $1000 and $500 for documentation. 

Any outstanding amount will go toward the campaign we are building - to inform people about Kibagare and other wetlands under threat and to raise the profile and urgency of the issue. 

Donations within Kenya can be made via MPESA at 0724 568 164. 
 
  The Impact
 Your support is of immense importance: in helping us to protect a 
vital and unique ecosystem and in safeguarding the livelihoods of the 
people who depend on the wetland. 
If we succeed, this struggle may also set a precedent for other wetlands and ecosystems under threat across Kenya.
  Risks & Challenges
We are aware that we are up against powerful people. On the other hand, we have a relatively new and progressive constitution and we have the chance to build the support that will strengthen our case. 
And, whether or not this case succeeds, it will still buy us time to continue the campaign while the construction is stalled. We can continue to create networks, publicize the issue and bring people together.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The atrocities being perpetrated against women and girls in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are nothing less than a femicide – the systematic destruction of the Congolese female population. Since 1996, sexual violence against women and girls in the Eastern DRC has been used as a weapon of war to torture, humiliate and destroy not only women and girls, but entire families and whole communities. Since the conflict began, hundreds of thousands of women and girls have been raped. Many members of the female population within the region have endured sexual slavery, kidnapping, unlawful detention, recruitment of young girls into armed forces.</p>
<p>As Panzi Hospital is presently the only referral hospital in North and South Kivu, V-Day and UNICEF in partnership with Panzi Foundation are currently building a special facility for the survivors of sexual violence, at the City of Joy.  Conceived, created and developed by the women on the ground, the City of Joy in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo will support women survivors of sexual violence to heal and provide them with opportunities to develop their leadership through innovative programming. Through its groundbreaking model, the City of Joy will provide up to 180 women a year with an opportunity to benefit from: group therapy; storytelling; dance; theater; self-defense; comprehensive sexuality education (covering HIV/AIDS, family planning); ecology and horticulture; and economic empowerment.</p>
<p>The City of Joy will provide women a place to heal emotionally as they rebuild their lives, turn their pain to power, and return back into their communities to lead.  Construction began in August 2009, in Bukavu, DRC, on the City of Joy and it was opened in 2010.</p>
<p>This Community Solar in DRCongo project, will add an 8kW solar electric system, that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introcduce solar technology to the community.</li>
<li>Take the community off dependence of diesel fuel. </li>
<li>Train the women on solar installation and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>My company will provide, the material and equipment for the solar system, and support 3 days of my time.   All funds ($6000 needed) raised through Indiegogo will go towards (10 days) travel, VISA's, accomodations, transport, safe passage, labor and misc. costs to install and energize the solar system.  A financial report of spending will be submitted to every donor after the Project.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The solar system will immediately reduce the cost of energy to the faciltiy, the savings can be used for other purposes.  The system, also introduces a technology that has not been accessible to this community.  Therefore the project is also a demonstation of how solar technology works, and thus allowing the users to think about how to adapt it to their lives.  At this point, energy, should be a human right, this project is demonstrating how it can be made a reality.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Story</strong></h3>
<p>We are the Friends of the Ontario Ranger Program.</p>
<p>The Ontario Ranger Program (ORP), formerly the Ontario Junior Ranger Program, was founded in 1944 and provided an opportunity for young workers to gain first-hand knowledge of resource management through a work and learning experience. More than 70,000 Ontario youth have participated in the 70-year old program.</p>
<p>In September 2012 the Liberal government - without prior public consultation - cancelled the program and shut down all 13 camps across the province. Now, Premier Kathleen Wynne’s government has committed $295 million dollars in the 2013 provincial budget for youth employment. Restoration of the Ontario Ranger Program fits the employment mandate for young people.</p>
<p>The Friends of the Ontario Ranger Program (FORP) is a group that aims to empower young people of Ontario to advocate for the full restoration of the Ontario Ranger Program. The goal is to demonstrate to all Ontarians that the Ontario Ranger Program is an integral part of the Ontario Public Service. FORP aims to find a positive and effective way to restore the program so the integrity and spirit of the Ontario Ranger Program can continue for future generations. Our objective are simple:</p>
<p>The FORP want to:</p>
<p>• Build awareness that the program has been discontinued</p>
<p>• Demonstrate by example the importance of Ontario Rangers Program</p>
<p>• Convince Premier Kathleen Wynne and the Minister of Natural Resources, David Orazietti to reinstate the program.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In an effort to promote our campaign and to raise awareness, the FORP are hosting a weekend Jamboree Reunion in Huntsville, ON on August 24, 2013.</p>
<p>This Jamboree will include speeches from Ranger Alumni and a celebrity guest, ranger memorabilia and The Friends of the Ontario Ranger Program (FORP) have volunteered to build an education trail.The trail is part of the Waterloo Summit Centre for the Environment and will feature minimum edge effects and minimum habitat fragmentation so the various types of wildlife will use this area as their home. The trail will connect the local community more to their natural environment.</p>
<p>The trail building will be an example of the kind of work being lost with the cancellation of the Ontario Ranger Program.</p>
<p>For further details about the eco-trail building event check out: <a href=""http://www.savetherangers.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.savetherangers.ca</a></p>
<p>Your generous donations will go towards funding all aspects of the event including, but not limited to: facility rental fees, advertising and promotional costs, and beyond the Jamboree to help move this campaign forward as we will continue to fight for this incredible program. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impace of your donations will be seen and felt in many different ways. Our main goal is to have the Ontario Ranger Program reinstated, to bring back this incredible opportunity to another 70,000 youth, and then another 70,000 more after that. </p>
<p>The immediate impact of your donation will be seen at the Jamboree in Huntsville on August 24th. By donating anything you can, you will be providing the Friends of the Ontario Ranger Program with the resources they need to make this event a suceess in spreading awareness of the program and ways people can help. </p>

Birdfair (Taking place in Cali, Colombia, February 13-16, 2015 ) is being hosted by the Asociación
Río Cali, a non-profit organization that works with rural communities
for the conservation of the  biodiversity of the Upper Cali River
watershed, contiguous to the Farallones National Park, one of the
most biologically diverse parks on the planet. Conservation of the
watershed is of critical importance to preserve the habitat of a very
diverse flora and fauna (many of them endangered) and to ensure the
provision of ecosystem services for a population of about 3,000,000
people.


La
primera versión de Colombia: Feria de Aves, se realizará en la
ciudad de Cali del 13 al 16 de Febrero, 2015 es organizada por la
Asociación Río Cali, una entidad privada sin ánimo de lucro que
trabaja con las comunidades rurales para la conservación de la
biodiversidad en la cuenca alta del río Cali, zona  de influencia
del Parque Nacional Natural Farallones de Cali, uno de las áreas
naturales  más biodiversas del planeta. La conservación de la cuenca
del río Cali es de suma importancia para preservar  el hábitat de
muchas especies de fauna y flora (algunas de ellas muy amenazadas) y
para asegurar los servicios ambientales para una población cercana a
los 3 millones de habitantes. 



The Colombia
Birdfair has as a goal to promote the conservation of the birds and
their habitats in the Upper Cali River Watershed and to promote
ecotourism in Cali and its rural areas as a strategy towards sustainable rural development  and the conservation of the biodiversity of
the area. The fair will provide a space where birders,
conservationists, students, academics and the general public can
enjoy the fascinating world of birds with their families, and at the
same time help promote their conservation.  All funds raised during
the Colombia Birdfair will go towards the purchase of land that will
allow for the establishment of a nature reserve, providing for the
conservation in perpetuity of more than 250 species of birds, many of
which are endangered.


Colombia: Feria de Aves tiene como meta promover la conservación 
de la aves y sus hábitats en la  cuenca alta del río Cali y
promover el  turismo de observación de aves en las zonas rurales de
Cali como estrategia de conservación de la biodiversidad y de
desarrollo rural sustentable. La Feria pretende ser un espacio donde
observadores de aves, conservacionistas, académicos y el púbico en
general puedan con sus familias aprender  y disfrutar del fascinante
mundo de las aves, a la vez que fomenta su conservación. Todos los
fondos recogidos durante la feria serán destinados a la compra de
tierras que permitan el establecimiento de un reserva natural  en la
cuenca alta del río Cali, propiciando la conservación a perpetuidad
de más de 250 especies de aves, muchas de ellas amenazadas y en
peligro de extinción.


This
campaign will raise funds to get the project started with a website,

<p>What will happen when our planet become uninhabitable? Do we have the techonology to colonize other planet?</p>
<p>Fortunately, we still can fix the situation, but this means the whole planet need to change our current lifestyle and it could delay hundreds of years to make that happen. And we don't have much time. So we need to act now and the human being has the techonology and the knowledge to counteract the global warming. How?</p>
<h3>There are many ways to save the planet, one of the most expensive are these:</h3>
<p>0. Implementing Renewable Energy from natural resources</p>
<p>Minimizing our dependence on fossil fuels can reduce carbon dioxide and methane levels in the atmosphere. Without harmful greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy can help lead the fight against global warming.</p>
<p>1. Wrapping Greenland</p>
<p>Dr Jason Box, a glaciologist from Ohio State University, proposes wrapping Greenland in a blanket. By covering the valleys that form darker areas, therefore attracting the sun's heat, he hopes to significantly slow the melting of the glacier.</p>
<p>2. Hungry ocean</p>
<p>Dr Brian von Herzen of the The Climate Foundation and marine biologists at the University of Hawaii and Oregon State University believe that the ocean could absorb much more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by creating plankton blooms. This is done by mixing the nutrient rich water in the colder depths of the ocean with the warmer surface water by placing huge wave-powered pumps on the swells of the North Pacific.</p>
<p>3. Raining forests</p>
<p>Consultant environmental engineer Mark Hodges believes forests could be generated by dropping ""tree bombs"" from a plane. The seedlings are dropped in a wax canister full of fertiliser that explodes when it hits the ground and grows into a tree. The method has already been used to regenerate mangrove forest in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>4. Infinite Winds</p>
<p>Fred Ferguson, a Canadian engineer specialising in airships, has designed a wind turbine that will use the constant winds that exist at 1,000 feet to produce renewable energy.</p>
<p>5. Brighter World</p>
<p>Stephen Salter, an Edinburgh University engineer, believes that clouds can be created to protect the world from the power of the sun. He proposes forming clouds above the ocean by sending salt into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>6. Fixing carbon</p>
<p>David Keith, 2006 Canadian Geographic Environmental Scientist of the Year, believes he can create a machine that sucks in ambient air and sprays it with sodium hydroxide and then expels it as clean air. The carbon from the air will be captured and stored underground.</p>

<h1>Here is where LWANDE project take place</h1>
<p>The planet belongs to each citizen of each country in the world. Today we are almost 7 billion people and at least the 30% of the global population has internet access. This means that 2.1 billion people can visit a website. In a perfect utopy, if the 2.1 billion people could visit a website against global warming and could donate or buy an item with a value of 1, 3 or 5 dollars, maybe more. The world would have more than 2.1 billion dollars to implement the technology to fix the global warming issue.</p>
<p>LWANDE wants to be the organization able to reach as many internet users as possible, show them the big problem we have, raise awarness on them and ask them a little donation or a purchase in order to collect funds to save the only planet we are able to live in.</p>
<h1>What We Need</h1>
<ul>
<li>A unique and professional website with a very attractive design available in different languages (as many as possible).</li>
<li>A mobile app for iPhone and Android: The app will have a game, news about global warming, donation widget and tips to have a green lifestyle. The sales of the app will be part of our main goal.</li>
<li>A huge campaign on the main Social Media like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Google+</li>
<li>A huge campaign on Google Adwords in order to appear in the most popular search engine of the world (Google) and its ads network.</li>
<li>The attention of well-known newspapers, news channel, periodists and important organizations.</li>
<li>We need to consolidate Lwande as the organization to save the world.</li>
</ul><p>As you may know, the advertising on internet could be cheap, but it is not so much when you want to reach millions of people. So, after a research the funds will be used in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multilanguage Profesional Website (U$3000)
<ul>
<li>Designer</li>
<li>Writers to create content about global warming and articles every week about the progress</li>
<li>Translators to make all the content available to the world</li>
<li>Marketers to create the best banners, videos and ads to call the attention of the users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mobile App for iPhone and Android (U$3000)</li>
<li>The First Social Media campaign (U$8000)
<ul>
<li>With U$8,000 it is possible to drive decent traffic to Lwande (around 200,000 visitors) with this, Lwande can make some noise and grab the attention of important companies that can contribute with more advertising or by giving some help as non-profit organization. Also, it is important to remember that Social Media is social network and the growth could be viral.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The First Campaign on Google (U$6000)
<ul>
<li>With U$6,000 it is possible to drive a campaign on Google and the network of websites that use Google Adsense, this will help to bring TARGETED traffic. This means, people who is already interested about global warming and is looking for a good way to help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get A Voice On International News
<ul>
<li>It could be really amazing to be present on Interntional News Channel, but it could be really expensive to but some time on TV. So, the idea is to get as much attention on internet as possible, then make contact with several newspaper and news channel in order to make Lwande appear on them. With Lwande will get respect, trust, love and support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be Consolidated
<ul>
<li>Once Lwande become to a consolidated organization against global warming, people will be able to make a donation without hesitate that the only goal is to SAVE THE PLANET.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h3>What will happen after?</h3>
<p>With all the donations, Lwande will have to contact the people able to create and implement the technology to set back the global warming. Of course with the help of international organizations like the ONU and some others.</p>
<p>Maybe it won't be possible to reach 2.1 billion people but if we can reach 5 million or 1 million able to contribute with U$10 dollars, it is possible to make a big change.</p>
<h1>If we don't reach the goal...</h1>
<p>The money collected will be reinvested in order to get the total sum to make this project real. We can't keep waiting while the planet is destroyed.</p>

<h3 align=""center"">
<strong>L</strong>ove, <strong>W</strong>ill<strong> AN</strong>D <strong>E</strong>ffort</h3></div>","Lwande is the name of our future organization with the main goal to become the most global and helpful campaign against the global warming.
The last years we have been witnesses of many tragedies caused by the Mother Nature; but she has been the victim of our human behaivor.
We think it is not necessary to show you that the Global Warming is a fact. But if you still have doubts about it, we can show you some good articles talking about the current environmental situation.


Global Warming Fast Facts by National Geographic

Global Warming Facts by Environmental Defense Fund

Global Warming by Discovery Channel
And you to know more about Global Warming we can recommend you a couple of films like:

HOME by Yann Arthus-Bertrand (Watch the complete movie HERE)

An Inconvenient Truth by Davis Guggenheim
And many others
Also maybe you have heard that the ice of the artic is melting, but you don't have idea how fast this is happening. Please watch this video made for NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).

 
And the most clear proof of the huge problem we have with the global warming are the facts we can see and some people can feel in their daily life.

The question is: Do we really need to touch the bottom to realize that our actions are having bad consequences in the planet?
What will happen when our planet become uninhabitable? Do we have the techonology to colonize other planet?
Fortunately, we still can fix the situation, but this means the whole planet need to change our current lifestyle and it could delay hundreds of years to make that happen. And we don't have much time. So we need to act now and the human being has the techonology and the knowledge to counteract the global warming. How?
There are many ways to save the planet, one of the most expensive are these:
0. Implementing Renewable Energy from natural resources

An many others...
It takes a lot of money to put some of these strategies to work.
The main problem is that nobody wants to spend their money in something that will not give any profit. Not even the governments.

A huge campaign on Google Adwords in order to appear in the most popular search engine of the world (Google) and its ads network.
The attention of well-known newspapers, news channel, periodists and important organizations.
We need to consolidate Lwande as the organization to save the world.
As you may know, the advertising on internet could be cheap, but it is not so much when you want to reach millions of people. So, after a research the funds will be used in this way:

OUR MISSION
Our mission is to help educate and inform people about the importance of Biodiversity in an easy to understand format and friendly environment. We believe that if people understand what Biodiversity is and how important it is, it will inspire them to do whatever they can to help stop Biodiversity loss.
How we will carry out our mission

Events will also include guest speakers from different environmental organizations that will share information on what their organization is doing and how people can get involved.
Focus on Children
Some of these events will focus on children, providing a friendly atmosphere that will engage their attention This is a very important part of our mission because children are our future and it is important to instill in them the importance of Biodiversity. This will help ensure a better future for the generations to come.Already in Progress 
In February of 2012, I began hosting a show on BlogTalkRadio.com
called ""From the Top"" My first guest was David Ainsworth, the
program officer for the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity. I have interviewed
guests from many different organizations that focus on Biodiversity and other
environmental issues. I believe that this show inspires and helps inform people
about what is being done, and what they can do to help stop biodiversity loss.


Expenses That Need to Be Covered
Event coordination
Basic technology equipment and maintenance
Audio  and Visual equipment for events
Production of literature and paraphernalia for events
Travel expenses.

Impact
While it would be so easy for all of us just to sit back and say “ let someone else worry about Biodiversity” it is far better to do what we can now. People naturally have the tendency to only worry about their individual bottom line and what seems to be affecting them at the present moment. However this is what leads to major complications in the future. Biodiversity loss is an issue that affects all of us, not just a certain group of people. So we all need to understand the importance of Biodiversity and what we can do to conserve it.

My family and I currently live in Kings Mountain NC. I am representing my family in this campaign to raise the funds we need to help us through a disaster. Fire damage made our home unlivable. And for the last three weeks we have been staying with family and friends and also in a motel. Thankfully none of us were injured but the down side is making sure the children continue the rest of this school year at their existing location. The McKinney Vento law says they may continue at the same school but we didn't qualify for the Gas reimbursement. Currently the travel to and from two separate schools each day gets complicated due to the distance it is from the Waco NC home we are staying. We desperately need to get back to Kings Mountain and establish residency there. The family member we are currently living with is in the process of moving herself and is not able to help us much longer with residency. We decided to begin this campaign after a family member told us about this website. On the day of the fire we spoke to the red cross which provide us only with the option of going to a city shelter. The shelter option will stay as a last resort idea. Asking and talking to everyone we come in contact with has given us a lot of hope, but the funds needed to get a new HOME are still yet to be made. This campaign is aimed to reach $20,000 for a family of seven. Sharlene (mom) Brian (dad) Greyson (12y/o son) Ethan (6y/o son) Ian (pronounced with a long I- 5y/o son) Rhiann (3y/o daughter) and Serenity (6mo daughter) We plan to move the remaining items from our still unrepaired home into storage. After that we will pay the entire amount of $288per week to stay @ the motel we stayed right after the fire. The motel had a staff that was comprised of some very compassionate and loving people from Nassau Bahamas. We have since established a relationship with them and would love to stay there until the remaining 8 weeks of this school year is up. The motel had a full size refrigerator and stove so food preparation is possible. After school ends we will be continuing with our previous plan to relocate to MD which is my original place of birth. Our move will cost us $500. The apt complex that we are moving to has a four bedroom available that runs for $1300 per mo. Once we get to MD Brian and Sharlene will began working on our family project to open a restaurant that serves delicious home style food. We had a family food service business that delivered food to our customers here in Kings Mt. We received a great deal of support from the locals who became loyal repeat consumers of our Cheeseburgers, Fish fillet sandwiches, Loaded Hot Dogs and Pulled pork sandwiches. Because the fire damage happened in our kitchen our family decided to view it in a positive way. Instead of thinking that our business was lost we view it as a blessing in disguise. We may have been moved from continuing to serve others at this time but our efforts to open the restaurant is still in effect. We all work together to prepare the food we have each day and the children love to participate in the seasoning process. They also come up with Ideas about recipes when we are talking food. Ethan aspires to be a chef when he becomes an adult. We know he is passionate about it because he speak about it often and he is the first to ask can he help. We are very grateful for any and all blessings. We recognize them all and pray every day together. We ask that if you feel what you have read about in this message please help us to move forward and not stay in a stuck position. As a family we have decided to find a way to donate to organization that help displaced families. It was very heart breaking to see that the community organizations; who assist in crises situations, could do nothing to help us get shelter. When we move to MD and start our restaurant we are going to find out which organizations are pro-active in helping homeless families. At a time in our life we had to stay in a homeless shelter for a short time. It was a very respectful and loving environment for women and children. We learned a great deal about working together and getting through a rough situation. The stay was a positive one and we have life long friends who we met there. I promised the children that we would never have to return their again. That promise was made from the bottom of my heart and I refuse to believe that I will have to break it. Please know that your help is needed and nothing will be left unnoticed. Even if you read this and are unable to help us we ask that you share our story with others and ask them to pray for our success. We have FAITH in abundance and we know we will reach our goal. Thank you so much in advance. At this time I will share this prayer..................Lord in Jesus name we pray......Father you protect us. You LOVE us. You direct us. You reveal to us our true purpose in life. Lord make us better GOD. Make us what and who you created us to be Lord. Make us LOVING and COMPASSIONATE.

Where people can come and get healing for cancer and other ailments based on donations and not because they have lack of funds.
They can live and work or stay for a while at these healing villages. Each Village will tailor to the communities needs. We are a melting pot and our ecovillages should represent this where people can learn from each others cultures, we will encourage community from local ecovillages we start such as Oakland to visit our ecovillage we will have in Ghana and merge the two together. Creating green jobs there an here using natural commodities.
Instead of eating junk food people will be taught how to make healthy foods. Creating communities starting in the bay area leading to around the world. Our goal in three years is to create 726 green jobs. Starting with the bay area. Instead of throwing away those in the community we come together to create a solution for our people, land , animals and environment.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are San Jose, CA's urban Park Rangers, and due to the severe budget crisis, we are an endangered species.  The current 2011/12 budget proposes the elimination of the entire program.  This threatens the legacy of San Jose's precious open space and the quality of life for its residents.  <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The Park Peace Officer's Association of San Jose (PPOASJ) supports the San Jose Park Rangers and seeks to educate the public and elected officials about the importance of Park Rangers in our urban spaces. The PPOASJ has also faced fiscal crisis which has impaired its ability to provide support for our Rangers.  With our finances stretched, we are unable to effectively reach out to the community and educate our residents about the impact the latest City budget has on our City Parks.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>Our goal is to raise $5,000 in order to engage in a direct mailing campaign and purchase ad space in local papers.  Any unused money will be used towards environmental education for youth in our parks.  <br/><br/>Please note that all contributions go directly to the PPOASJ, a non-profit organization, and not to individuals or to the City of San Jose.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you simply can't spare any money, we understand.  But your voice is just as powerful as your checkbook.  Email or call your local San Jose representative to tell them that you value Park Rangers in your parks.  Please visit <a href=""http://www.sanjoseparkranger.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sanjoseparkranger.org</a> to find out other ways that you can help.<br/></p>
