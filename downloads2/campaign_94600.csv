<h2>Lab(Oratory) Podcast</h2>
<p>Lab(Oratory) Podcast is a web-based radio program with the purpose of showcasing the human side of science using recorded interviews from Retired or Emeritus Status Scientists. Through these interviews we'll lift the veil on the Science Community and allow our listeners to get a better understanding of the world of science, the history of scientific discoveries, the challenges of research, and the changes the science community has gone through over the years. </p>
<p>For more info head over to : LabOratory-Podcast.com</p>
<h3><strong>Why Lab(Oratory) Podcast?</strong></h3>
<p>There is a generation of scientists with stories that haven’t been told. Stories of why and how they got into the field, stories of the methods they used that are being forgotten due to technological advances, stories of others they have worked alongside, and stories of how the scientific community as well as the public have both resisted and welcomed changes to the accepted norms through the years. </p>
<p>On top of this, we feel that there is a distinct disconnect between people who do scientific research for their living versus those who do not, where scientists are often portrayed as cold, unapproachable, and having a “better than thou” mindset.</p>
<p>We believe that sharing these stories can not only educate us into lesser known areas of science, but also remind us that we are truly part of a human community. A community that relies on each person’s input and contribution, no matter how large, small, or publicly advertised it may be. </p>
<h3><strong>Who Are The Lab(Oratory) Podcasters?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>RENE</strong>:  Rene is our resident scientist, and the ""Lab"" part of LabOratory! She studied at Carnegie Mellon University, where she did her undergrad and master's in Biological Sciences and Computational Biology. Currently she works as a Research Assistant at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution where she studies genetics of the ocean. When not in the lab, you can find her on stage in local theater productions, baking up nerdy and delicious baked goods in her kitchen, or hanging out with horseshoe crabs on the tidal flats of Cape Cod. </p>
<p><strong>SAM</strong>: Sam is our Sound Designer extraordinaire, and the ""Oratory"" part of LabOratory! Originally from Pennsylvania, she has her Master's in Sound Design from CalArts and through the years has worked with a variety of theaters on some great projects, from Pippin at the A.R.T. in Cambridge to Stomp in New York City. Sam loves playing sports, yoga, and has a not-so-secret talent of creating amazing works of chalkboard art.</p>

Right now, each guest has generously donated their time to the show. I'd like to be able to pay them what they're worth.</p><h3>$4200</h3><p>When we hit this stretch goal, I get paid. In the city I live in, minimum wage is $15 per hour. I put in about 6-8 hours per episode, which means production hours add up very quickly. This stretch goals allows me to keep dedicating time and effort into making this the best possible show. And frankly, if I get paid, that money goes straight back into making the show even better, as I will then be in a position to upgrade my equipment and mini sound studio.</p><h3>$4800</h3><p>When we hit this stretch goal, money starts going back into the pockets of the creators we love. Each creator roasted on the show will receive a donation to their Patreon/Ko-Fi/etc - just because we love them!</p><h3>$6800</h3><p>Wow wow wow!! When we hit this stretch goal, I'll be able to commission a piece of art featuring all of the roasters and roastees!</p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>There is always a risk in any production. I am committed to being transparent to all of my supporters; whether it be about shipping delays/issues or pushing episode release deadlines.</p><p>Frankly, I don’t foresee any challenges in the episode releases. At this point, all episodes in Season 1 have been recorded and more than 50% of them have been edited and produced.</p><p>The biggest challenges will be twofold:</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>International Shipping:</strong> I live in Canada. Recently our postal service went on strike. I’m committed to making sure supporters get their rewards, but that may mean that should the postal service strike again, supporters either have to wait longer OR I look into paying premium shipping costs for third-party shipping.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Honey Harvest: </strong>From my understanding, honey is harvested twice per year: once in the Spring and once in the Fall.

</ul><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short SummaryA honey roast is like a comedy roast, but only sweet and nice things!Honey Roast is a podcast where every other week, guest stars “roast” a creator  that they love and are inspired by. Together, we’re bringing a little more love and hope in the world and introducing listeners to new creators through sweetness and delight.Honey Roast was born from the idea that it feels good when love, sweetness, and kindness is directed to you, to a creator you also love, or even to someone you don’t know but now get to discover.It’s all wholesome hopepunk, which is something we need a little bit more of in the world today.About The Creator (Tess)I’m Tess. I care a lot about making my communities a better, more hopeful, and more celebratory space. We’re doing so many amazing things, and I want the world to know about them.This campaign is so important to me because YOU are important to me. Creators inspire me, make me laugh, make me cry, give me something to connect with. I want to help you make a connection. I want you to hear your favourite creators gushing about their favourite creators. I want you to be inspired and end an episode feeling the love, care, passion, and hope.Crew MembersOur crew include Podcast Consultant Wil Williams, Indiegogo Consultant Alex Hensley, Composer Emily E. Meo, Graphic Artist Mandy Corcoran, and Sound Designer/Co-Producer Julia Schifini!What We NeedI truly believe in creators and artists being paid fair wages, especially since I am limited by my own abilities as well as what I can personally pay. This indiegogo is largely covering the costs of getting the show off to its best start, which means paying for Graphic Design (logo, header, icon, other art assets), Website-related Costs (hosting & domain), Music Composition, Consultations, and Sound Design.Ideally, I’d also like to pay all of the guest stars. They’ve generously donated their time, but I’d like to give back to them. And I’d like to be able to pay myself too, but more about that in the Stretch Goals.Listen to the TrailersYou can listen to the trailer ""Introducing Honey Roast"" by clicking here.You can listen to the mini -trailer ""What's a Honey Roast"" by clicking here. What You Get: The Sweet GoodiesI truly believe in giving back to my community, and that’s not limited to the Podcasting Community! As such, I’ve centred all of the perks around supporting both me AND local Canadian bee farmers. Each honey product will be sourced from a *different* local honey farmer so that we’re supporting many different local farms!Sweet Supporter: Credit & A Shout-OutYou’ll receive your name on honeyroastpod.com AND we’ll shout out our thanks to you on Twitter!Party Bee: Live-Listen Pre-Launch PartyYou’ll receive a link in your inbox to a live-listen pre-launch party where we’ll do a live listen of the first THREE episodes together, a few days before launch! You'll also get all lower tier perks.Sticky Sweetheart: The Cutest StickerYou’ll receive a cute lil’ sticker to remind you of how sweet the world can be. You'll also get all lower tier perks.Bee Sweet: A Beeswax BarYou’ll receive a sweet little beeswax bar; Beeswax has been used for thousands of years, let’s make it a few more! You'll also get all lower tier perks.Sweet Tooth: Honey CaramelsYou’ll receive an entire bag of sweet melt-in-your-mouth honey caramels! You'll also get all lower tier perks.Smooth Sweetness: A Honey DripperYou’ll receive a honey dripper for drizzling your honey perfectly on toast, in tea, or into a measuring spoon. It's the best honey accessory! You'll also get all lower tier perks.Producer Bee: ProducerYou’ll be a producer! Your name will be called out at the beginning of each episode in Season 1 as a thank you! You'll also get all lower tier perks, and maybe even a secret surprise that will be announced later in the campaign!Honey Bee: Local Canadian HoneyYou’ll receive a jar of HONEY; The only thing sweeter than a Honey Roast is actual honey! You'll also get all lower tier perks.Luxury Sweetie: Raw HoneycombYou’ll receive an actual raw honeycomb. Honeycomb is the rawest form of honey and is a luxurious topping or pairing for cheese, fruit, meat, and bread. You'll also get all lower tier perks.**honey not pictured but is 100% pure raw Canadian honey and the honey dripperOur SuppliersThree Foragers, Drizzle, and True North ApiaryStretch Goals$3700When we hit this stretch goal, every guest will receive a $75 payment for their time. Right now, each guest has generously donated their time to the show. I'd like to be able to pay them what they're worth.$4200When we hit this stretch goal, I get paid. In the city I live in, minimum wage is $15 per hour. I put in about 6-8 hours per episode, which means production hours add up very quickly. This stretch goals allows me to keep dedicating time and effort into making this the best possible show. And frankly, if I get paid, that money goes straight back into making the show even better, as I will then be in a position to upgrade my equipment and mini sound studio.$4800When we hit this stretch goal, money starts going back into the pockets of the creators we love. Each creator roasted on the show will receive a donation to their Patreon/Ko-Fi/etc - just because we love them!$6800Wow wow wow!! When we hit this stretch goal, I'll be able to commission a piece of art featuring all of the roasters and roastees!Risks & ChallengesThere is always a risk in any production. I am committed to being transparent to all of my supporters; whether it be about shipping delays/issues or pushing episode release deadlines.Frankly, I don’t foresee any challenges in the episode releases. At this point, all episodes in Season 1 have been recorded and more than 50% of them have been edited and produced.The biggest challenges will be twofold:

International Shipping: I live in Canada. Recently our postal service went on strike. I’m committed to making sure supporters get their rewards, but that may mean that should the postal service strike again, supporters either have to wait longer OR I look into paying premium shipping costs for third-party shipping. 

Honey Harvest: From my understanding, honey is harvested twice per year: once in the Spring and once in the Fall. To counter this, I’ve limited the amount of physical honey product perks available so that I don’t have to worry about overcommitting what I can realistically source from local farmers. This shouldn’t affect the expected delivery date for these products, unless the weather or other unexpected environmental events affect the ability for harvest to occur.

<h3><strong>We love neighborhoods. </strong></h3>

<p>We believe that churches embedded in walkable neighborhoods have unique opportunities to do ministry in creative ways. We started <a href=""http://www.embeddedchurch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Embedded Church Podcast</a> as an outlet for sharing the dynamic stories of churches harnessing opportunities in their local, walkable context to reach their neighborhoods for the common good. </p>
<p>We believe this work of churches is increasingly vital as we see two cultural shifts happening in our cities: 1) people are moving back to the city, looking for walkable, connected communities; 2) people are lonelier than ever. The church has a crucial role to play in connecting people to a place and to one another. Jeremiah 29:7 calls us to ""seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.""</p>
<h3><strong>We want to grow the vision.</strong></h3>
<p>With <a href=""http://www.embeddedchurch.com/podcast"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Season 1</a> under our belt, we want to keep sharing the stories that have already inspired our listeners, sparked generous gifts, and taught us the value of listening to local community needs. We are so thankful for the support and encouragement we've received from our listeners. We fully believe this podcast has the capacity to grow and encourage, resource, and ignite church leaders across our country to take active and creative steps to fight against the loneliness permeating the lives of so many people in our neighborhoods and congregations. We hope to see congregations across America become catalyzers of belonging and purpose within the neighborhoods where they meet, fostering a deep community that promotes the welfare of our churches and our cities. </p>

<h2><strong>Welcome to New Candler...</strong></h2>
<p>Welcome to New Candler, cultural epicenter of the United States. Visit Trudon Circle, an art mecca turned tourist trap where you can find musicals, massive neon billboards, street performers, and pickpockets. The bodega on 12th and Salt will sell you spells on the cheap if you know how to ask, but everyone knows they’re better quality on Root and Amsterdam. But if you’re a magic user -- <i>or, as pretty much everyone nowadays says, a muse </i>-- you’d better be wearing a Halo so your magic doesn’t make a ruckus or hurt anyone.</p>

<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><strong><a href=""https://hughouse.productions/valence/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>VALENCE</i></a></strong> is an urban fantasy audio drama that deals with themes of abuse, trauma, queer identity, marginalization, rebellion, found family, breaking cycles, and hope. Thematically, <i>VALENCE</i> is a realistic drama with the energy of an espionage-heavy political thriller, an 80’s John Hughes romance, and character-heavy Noah Baumbach indies. Think <i>The Magicians</i> handled with realism, or <i>Mr. Robot</i> handled with whimsy.</p>
<p>After being recruited by a new government agency, a depressive magic user must stop the unethical practices of his estranged family and the country’s most successful “medical” tech startup.</p>
<p>Season 1 of <i>VALENCE</i> will feature 7 primary actors, 4 secondary actors, and various other voice actors appearing in smaller roles. The first season will consist of 12 episodes featuring full sound design to help our listeners experience the world of <i>VALENCE</i>.

<p>Surviving the apocalypse is hard enough to begin with. So is getting through high school in one piece. Trying to do both at the same time? <i>Ugh.</i></p>

Because between the ongoing food shortage, the roaming packs of mutants, and that one demon who has been hanging out by the water fountain since last June, well, there’s always something important to announce.</p>
<p>Some of the students are thriving in the new environment, leading field trips into the unexplored wilderness that used to be their small town. Some of the students are grudgingly coping as they're forced into new roles... like doing the school’s morning announcements. And some of the students still haven't figured out why the big homecoming game isn't happening this year. </p>

<h3>Why <i>{Queer} Pride and Prejudice</i>?</h3>
<p><i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is a story that has endured for many reasons - it is funny and romantic, clever and insightful. It challenges the audience to examine their judgments and biases, and it reminds us that true love is not transactional, but transformative. Many of us grew up with this story, and lots of us found it later in life and fell in love with it. For some of us, it is one of those stories that we turn to again and again to feel comfort. </p>
<p>And, I mean, come on - PRIDE is right there in the title. How could we resist?</p>
<p>Every single person involved in this audio drama is LGBTQIA+. By casting this way, it allowed us to create a story that shows queer relationships in a historical context, challenging strict gender roles and letting audience members experience the same kind of historical romance and happy ending that cis, straight people have gotten to see themselves in for so long.</p>

<h3>What Happens if We Don't Meet Our Goal?</h3>
<p>Asking for financial assistance can be a risk, and we acknowledge that we are asking for a tidy sum and may not reach that goal. In the event of that happening, whatever is raised will be distributed among the cast and crew at the promised rates, and the release of the show will be delayed in order to accommodate for me paying whatever is left out of pocket. It will take a significantly longer time for me to afford to pay everyone myself, which is why I'm asking for help in the first place.  </p>
<p>No matter what, the show <i>will </i>happen - in fact, recording is already underway - but your assistance will provide great financial relief and allow us to pay everyone involved in a more timely manner.</p>

</div></div>","Who are we?
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a queer adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, full of some of the most exciting names in indie audio drama, must be in want of some funding.

Okay, okay, I won't do that the whole time.My name is Caroline Mincks, one of the creators of {Queer} Pride and Prejudice: a loving and faithful adaptation of the beloved Jane Austen classic that happens to be very queer. We are creating a version of this story that is diverse, inclusive, and more representative of our society today, while retaining the setting and spirit of the original story.

<h3>Sidequesting Season 2</h3>
<p>Hi there! I'm Tal Minear and I make <strong><a href=""https://sidequesting.carrd.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sidequesting</a></strong>, a fantasy podcast about avoiding the main plot. Season 1 just finished (you can listen to it <a href=""https://radiopublic.com/sidequesting-6vrl09"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>), and I'd love some help funding season 2.</p>
<p><i>What's this show about, you ask?</i> Sidequesting follows Rion, an adventurer who’s willing to help anyone out - as long as they’re not being asked to deal with the scary wizard that everyone keeps talking about. They travel from town to town, meeting new people and doing new things. Inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, Skyrim, and Lord of the Rings, Sidequesting pulls from classic tropes across fantasy stories and subverts them. Season 2 will continue this, featuring lighthearted fantasy stories with modern representation.</p>
<p><i>What needs funding, you ask?</i> Primarily the guest actors in each episode, who I pay for their time and talent! There are also smaller costs associated with the show, such as hosting fees, stickers, business cards, etc. I'd also love to be able to pay myself a small stipend for producing Sidequesting.</p>
<p>Season 2 will consist of 10 episodes that will air throughout this year. This crowdfunding goal breaks down to $80 per episode, with some of that money going towards crowdfunding costs. This season is happening regardless of if this goal is met, but your support means I can write longer episodes (with more characters!), and worry less about money while doing so. Plus, you can get some rad perks and feel good about supporting indie audio fiction!</p>
<p><strong>If you like: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Independent Audio Fiction</li>
<li>Lighthearted Stories</li>
<li>LGBTQA+ Representation</li>
<li>New Takes on Fantasy Tropes</li>

The season takes longer to come out than expectedThe 10 episodes of season 2 will air sometime this year. Episodes will be spaced out approximately 2-4 weeks (though longer if something happens to me, like getting sick). If you expect this, you won't be disappointed!


Your digital reward arrives later than expectedThe season 1 related digital rewards are finished and will be sent to you when this campaign closes, but the season 2 digital rewards will be created along with the season. They will be all be released within a month of episode 20 airing (and likely sooner). If you expect this, you won't be disappointed!


Your physical perk(s) get lost in the mailI have all the physical perks in my possession already (so acquiring them is not a risk), but if your reward gets lost in the mail I'll resend it to you!

<p>This campaign remains active, if you want to contribute to keep raising more funds, you're welcome to do it!</p>
<p><strong>If you want to buy the first ever Easy Spanish grammar digital book</strong>, choose the 25 Kilómetros perk or any higher one and you'll get the book via e-mail when we publish it (early 2019).</p>
<p>Any doubts, send a message an email to Juan at easyspanishvideos@gmail.com!</p>
<p>THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is this about? </h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>This is a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds to do an Easy Spanish video tour through Spain</strong><strong>:</strong>
</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Toledo... [backers for this crowdfunding campaign will vote which cities to visit] to produce the very first Easy Spanish episodes with the highly requested Spanish accent!</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<h3>Why me? Why am I doing this?<br/> </h3>
</div><div>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I've lost count on how many times you've asked me to produced videos in Spain!  <br/>As a professional video maker <strong>I know the difficulties and struggles that come with independent video production. ​</strong>The thing is that right now new collaborators can't earn money with Easy Spanish (I can barely survive myself with my current income as a full-time independent producer), meaning that even when new collaborators have the desire to make videos, they have no time to do so. That's why it has never worked out to have people as volunteers. Me, on the other hand,<strong> I'm involved 100% on this. </strong><br/><br/><strong>So it's pretty simple to pitch you this campaign: I would like to go to Spain myself and film the whole crazy adventure of getting there, talk to the people in the streets, make many vlogs about the journey, my experience there as a Mexican and the cultural shocks that come with that </strong>and stay there for as long as I can - based on how much money this campaign raises.  It'll be an intense non-stop filming journey for the new Easy Spanish series!</p>
<p><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You're making Easy Spanish happening. You decide how far this project goes.</span><br/> </h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I don't think I'll ever get comfortable with asking people to support me financially, but I mean, it's not really like that. Social media, Youtube and the way the world works nowadays it's amazing for young entrepreneurs, for me, instead of having a boss telling me what to do, which is so </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">uninspiring</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;""> to me, I can do things on my own and publish them </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">available</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;""> for free on Youtube, so anyone can have access to them.<br/><br/><strong>The impact this project is having is starting to grow so much and the response from you - the fans, has been so </strong></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>overwhelmingly positive</strong> that </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">with hard work and discipline</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> <strong>this is actually turning into not only my full-time job but into my dream job.</strong> I cannot describe the life of a youtuber, an influencer, a digital social media content creator (however you want to call it), I can only say that is insane and it's such a beautiful job - being able to have an impact on people's lives and give them something that is feeding them such important things as multicultural perspectives and a multicultural friendly digital environment.</span></font></p>
<p><br/><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span></font></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What happens if we achieve the goal?<br/> </h3>
<ul>
<li>If we raise the 100% of the campaign funding, I will be able to spend a month producing Easy Spanish in Spain!</li>
<li>If we raise 150% of the campaign funding, I will be able to spend two months producing Easy Spanish in Spain!</li>
<li>If we raise 200% of the campaign funding, I'll be able to spend three whole months producing Easy Spanish in Spain!</li>
</ul>
<p><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you back this project? What do you get in return?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>So pretty much it's up to you on how long and how many videos you want me to produce in Spain. <strong>As a thank you for your amazing support you'll get incredible gifts in return like THE VERY FIRST EASY SPANISH GRAMMAR E-BOOK!</strong> Exclusively for backers of this campaign, that's the least I can do! </p>
<p><strong>To become a backer and make a donation just choose any of the perks from the right </strong>depending on the donation you intend to make and your interest on the gifts you'd like to receive in return. If you need assistance or you'd like to ask me for more details, send me a message here or in any of my social media profiles.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<h3>¡Gracias!<br/> </h3>
<p>Thank you so much for reading until the end. If you have the desire and the opportunity to help me raise the funds, please don't hesitate to do so. If you are not in the position to do so, don't worry, <strong>you can also help in other ways.</strong></p>
<p><br/> </p>
<h3>So, what else can you do to support?<br/> </h3>

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
---------------------------------------------
 
What is this about? 
 

This is a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds to do an Easy Spanish video tour through Spain:

Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Toledo... [backers for this crowdfunding campaign will vote which cities to visit] to produce the very first Easy Spanish episodes with the highly requested Spanish accent!
 
Why me? Why am I doing this? 

I've lost count on how many times you've asked me to produced videos in Spain!  As a professional video maker I know the difficulties and struggles that come with independent video production. ​The thing is that right now new collaborators can't earn money with Easy Spanish (I can barely survive myself with my current income as a full-time independent producer), meaning that even when new collaborators have the desire to make videos, they have no time to do so. That's why it has never worked out to have people as volunteers. Me, on the other hand, I'm involved 100% on this. So it's pretty simple to pitch you this campaign: I would like to go to Spain myself and film the whole crazy adventure of getting there, talk to the people in the streets, make many vlogs about the journey, my experience there as a Mexican and the cultural shocks that come with that and stay there for as long as I can - based on how much money this campaign raises.  It'll be an intense non-stop filming journey for the new Easy Spanish series!
 


You're making Easy Spanish happening. You decide how far this project goes. 
I don't think I'll ever get comfortable with asking people to support me financially, but I mean, it's not really like that. Social media, Youtube and the way the world works nowadays it's amazing for young entrepreneurs, for me, instead of having a boss telling me what to do, which is so uninspiring to me, I can do things on my own and publish them available for free on Youtube, so anyone can have access to them.The impact this project is having is starting to grow so much and the response from you - the fans, has been so overwhelmingly positive that with hard work and discipline this is actually turning into not only my full-time job but into my dream job. I cannot describe the life of a youtuber, an influencer, a digital social media content creator (however you want to call it), I can only say that is insane and it's such a beautiful job - being able to have an impact on people's lives and give them something that is feeding them such important things as multicultural perspectives and a multicultural friendly digital environment.
 

What happens if we achieve the goal? 

If we raise the 100% of the campaign funding, I will be able to spend a month producing Easy Spanish in Spain!
If we raise 150% of the campaign funding, I will be able to spend two months producing Easy Spanish in Spain!
If we raise 200% of the campaign funding, I'll be able to spend three whole months producing Easy Spanish in Spain!

 

How can you back this project? What do you get in return?
 
So pretty much it's up to you on how long and how many videos you want me to produce in Spain. As a thank you for your amazing support you'll get incredible gifts in return like THE VERY FIRST EASY SPANISH GRAMMAR E-BOOK! Exclusively for backers of this campaign, that's the least I can do! 
To become a backer and make a donation just choose any of the perks from the right depending on the donation you intend to make and your interest on the gifts you'd like to receive in return. If you need assistance or you'd like to ask me for more details, send me a message here or in any of my social media profiles.
 
¡Gracias! 
Thank you so much for reading until the end. If you have the desire and the opportunity to help me raise the funds, please don't hesitate to do so. If you are not in the position to do so, don't worry, you can also help in other ways.
 
So, what else can you do to support? 

You can share this campaign with your friends, colleagues, Spanish teachers, your Spanish learning institute or just someone that is interested in the Spanish culture.
If you live in Spain or you know someone there with the possibility of offering me a place to stay while I'm on tour (doesn't matter where), you can contact me at easyspanishvideos@gmail.com
If you know any sponsors that would be interested on helping this crowdfunding and make a collaboration with Easy Spanish in Spain, in Europe or somewhere else, you can also contact me at easyspanishvideos@gmail.com 
If you live in a different European country and you'd like to meet me in your city to spend some time helping you improve your Spanish and be a guest on Easy Spanish and you have the possibility of paying for travel expenses, you can contact me at easyspanishvideos@gmail.com

<p>We've been racking our brains for a decent solution to have as many of you as possible at our <strong><a href=""https://dighill80.com/london"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Presentation of Findings Live event in London</a></strong> next week. Of course, aside from you buying a €50 ticket to join us there, the natural solution would be for us to do a live stream here but we don't think live streaming a panel event with lots of sides and multiple speakers from a single iPhone could do it all justice. </p>
<p>So we thought about selling tickets to do something a bit slicker but that runs the risk of us not selling enough tickets to cover our costs - and we can't risk eating away at our small reserves as this is desperately needed to cover the last few bits of post-processing and research.</p>
<p>What to do? We need to raise €1000 to provide a decent quality livestream and have a little bit left over to put in the kitty...Then it dawned on us, why not run a micro-crowdfunder for 1 week? It's not like we haven't been crazy enough to think that would work before, eh? </p>
<p>We're running this 6-day micro-crowdfunding campaign to raise €1000. Everyone that pledges €10 or more will get access to the livestream <strong>and</strong> a replay of the presentation of findings event taking place next Monday night in London with our special guests. <br/><br/><strong>***NEW PERK ALERT!***</strong></p>
<p>For €20.00 you'll get access to the live stream AND be invited to join our <strong>Virtual Dig Team </strong>private Facebook group. In the group you'll be able to catch-up with every single daily live stream from the 8-week excavation, access loads of videos, photos, posts, and join our thriving community with over 1000 members!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Before I was comfortable with myself, when I was hiding that I was gay, it would've been comforting to hear the stories of other queer people. I believe it would have reassured me that I wasn't alone. </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Valerie and I work as a video producer with a background in journalism. This is a passion project of mine that I have been working on for several months. I have completed 10+ interviews with people who are diverse in age, race, and experience. I'm excited to share all of these folx' amazing stories. Your contribution will make sure my product is polished before its released and will send a message to those who need to hear they're not alone. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am raising money to fund the intro song, logo, and other basic production costs to launch season one and to start season two. Any contribution is welcome but the first 50 people to donate $50 will get a magnet with the new logo on it. If you donate $100 or more you get an episode dedicated to you at the start and end of the show. Please help me spread the word! Thank you for taking the time and any contribution is greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>Long Story Short...</h3>
<p>This Indiegogo drive will cover the costs of paying everyone involved—the actors, the sound editor, and the artist. This is my first time manning the reigns on an audio drama of my own, and even though it's a short miniseries, I want it to be of amazing quality. That's where <i>you</i> can help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Creator</h3>
<p>Jack Pevyhouse is an award-winning writer and audio drama podcaster with a BA in English from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. He currently works for <a href=""http://crossroadstations.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Crossroad Stations</a> as a scriptwriter and assistant producer for the audio drama podcast <a href=""http://jimrobbieandthewanderers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>J</i><i>im Robbie and the Wanderers</i></a>, and voice actor for <a href=""http://mbd.crossroadstations.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Misadventure by Death</i></a> and <a href=""http://otherverse.podbean.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Otherverse</i></a>. </p>
<p>Initially, this idea was in the form of a poem, written during his time as a poetry candidate in the Creative Writing MFA Program at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. He decided not to continue his studies after a year in favor of becoming even more involved in the audio drama community and producing his own audio drama instead.</p>
<h3>Progress So Far…</h3>
<p>We're planning on launching the first episode in late November of this year, with a new episode every two weeks until it’s complete!</p>
<p>As of right now, the show has been cast, and recording will begin in the last week of September!</p>
<p>As for a crew, I have Julia Schifini of <a href=""https://www.tidespodcast.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Tides</i></a>, <i><a href=""https://wtfrequency.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What’s the Frequency</a></i>, and the boozy mythological talk show <a href=""https://www.spiritspodcast.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Spirits</i></a> joining the cast as the Guide, and Erin Baumann, sound editor and designer for <i>Misadventure by Death</i> joining us as our sound editor as well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How the funds will be used:</h3>
<p>Most audio dramas are a completely unpaid labor of love—however, sound editing isn’t easy, and professional editors deserve pay, and I’d hate to see Erin slave over something for free. $800 will be covering the sound editing of all 4 episodes, while $200 will cover hosting fees. I also would love to pay the voice actors and cover artist for their hard work and time, so the remaining $500 will be evenly split among the cast and artist.</p>
<h3>Perks! Goodies! Stuff!</h3>
<p>Given this will only be around two hours of content, physical goodies like shirts and posters will most likely come later as a part of the Crossroad Stations store. However, backers will be receiving things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to behind-the-scenes updates</li>
<li>Blooper reel</li>
<li>A recording of the Guide reciting the original poem this was based on!</li>
<li>An Associate Producer’s credit!</li>
</ul>
<h3>In Closing</h3>
<p>Thank you for your support! If you aren’t able to help financially, spreading the word will be enough! Even if we only receive half, or a quarter, or just a single dollar, this miniseries <i>will</i> be made!</p>

<p>We are taking steps towards something that was always our intention from the start - making this work financially sustainable. This has been a labour of love, created with passion, dedication, borrowed equipment and joy. All costs and contributions have been largely out of pocket. With this fundraiser we hope to be able to recoup costs, buy equipment, pay the artists that generously gave us their music, and pay ourselves for the research, production, editing, transcription, art making and publishing labour we did and will continue to do.</p>

We practiced building a collaborative team with a common vision and desire to centre generative process at the heart of producing this podcast. We have interviewed folks we have admired and loved from close and afar, with deep dive conversations that make our hearts soar and we hope yours too. We produced transcripts for our (sometimes way too long) episodes to increase accessibility of our show. We created artworks for each episode as a way to honour the expansiveness we experienced while having those conversations.

Being able to connect and share around the world through social media has always intrigued me. Rebelle Zine uses the power of social media to create a platform and voice for underrepresented groups within the creative industries and I am honoured to have a major part in that. Outside of Rebelle Zine I’ve managed some social media business accounts but am currently working on starting up a YouTube channel and business account for myself and my partner.

I’m the Web Designer of Rebelle Zine. I’ve always been interested in anything media related ever since I was a kid and tackled different mediums including graphic design, videography, photography, creative direction and web design. I enjoy collaborating and searching for local artists and believe that everyone deserves a place to shine, making Rebelle Zine an important project I take pride in being a part of. Outside of Rebelle Zine I’ve been working with local artists directing and editing music videos. I am also a part of a creative studio known as Underscore Studios. In the future, I wish to continue being involved in more creative projects in relation to the music and fashion industry as well as meet and work with more local artists!</p><p> </p><p>MAEVE | PRODUCER &amp; LEAD WRITER</p><p>they/she | Taurus</p><p>IG: @maevedelia</p><p>Hey!

As soon as I heard what Rebelle was all about, I was ready to jump on board as producer to help create something impactful. I really enjoy bringing all the moving parts together to make our vision come to life. I’m also eager to write content for our zine! Writing is one of my favourite elements of media production - in fact, I have a concentration in screenwriting - and my goal is to create content that does justice to the amazing talent we’re going to feature. Outside of Rebelle, I’m an independent music artist under the name Maeve Delia. I'm also the Executive Director of Ryenamics, an award-winning competitive a cappella group from X University.

I’m passionate about storytelling and education, so many of the projects I’ve worked on value these two elements. Outside of my role on the Rebelle team, I’m a media coordinator at a local Japanese school where I create educational resources. I hope to work in the post-production industry someday, and would love to ultimately pursue a career in teaching! </p><p> </p><p>SARAH | CREATIVE DIRECTOR</p><p>she/her | Aries</p><p>IG: @snappedbysarahmc</p><p>Portfolio: <a href=""http://www.sarahmcintyre.myportfolio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sarahmcintyre.myportfolio.com</a></p><p>Hi, I’m Sarah! I am the Creative Director &amp; Photographer for Rebelle Zine. I’ve always been inspired by art &amp; design, and found myself longingly watching behind-the-scenes videos for editorial shoots. One day I thought, “What’s stopping me from doing this myself?,” and so Rebelle Zine was born with the aim of highlighting underrepresented groups within the creative industries. My role on Rebelle Zine is pretty much my dream job. If I can find a way to make this my career, I may be the happiest person on this planet.

In the future I wish to pursue a career similar to my role on Rebelle Zine, anything to do with social media and creating is the long term goal!  JENNY | WEB DESIGNERshe/her | GeminiIG: @jenbalitePortfolio: https://jbalite.myportfolio.com/work Hey, I’m Jenny. I’m the Web Designer of Rebelle Zine. I’ve always been interested in anything media related ever since I was a kid and tackled different mediums including graphic design, videography, photography, creative direction and web design. I enjoy collaborating and searching for local artists and believe that everyone deserves a place to shine, making Rebelle Zine an important project I take pride in being a part of. Outside of Rebelle Zine I’ve been working with local artists directing and editing music videos. I am also a part of a creative studio known as Underscore Studios. In the future, I wish to continue being involved in more creative projects in relation to the music and fashion industry as well as meet and work with more local artists! MAEVE | PRODUCER & LEAD WRITERthey/she | TaurusIG: @maevedeliaHey! I’m Maeve. As soon as I heard what Rebelle was all about, I was ready to jump on board as producer to help create something impactful. I really enjoy bringing all the moving parts together to make our vision come to life. I’m also eager to write content for our zine! Writing is one of my favourite elements of media production - in fact, I have a concentration in screenwriting - and my goal is to create content that does justice to the amazing talent we’re going to feature. Outside of Rebelle, I’m an independent music artist under the name Maeve Delia. I'm also the Executive Director of Ryenamics, an award-winning competitive a cappella group from X University. I hope to continue coordinating creative projects in the future! MIKU | VIDEOGRAPHER & EDITORshe/her | LibraIG: @miku.sakamotoHi hello, I’m Miku! As the videographer of Rebelle Zine, I’m beyond excited to not only share the stories of our featured creatives through my favourite medium, but also learn about the stories of our community through various art forms! I’m passionate about storytelling and education, so many of the projects I’ve worked on value these two elements. Outside of my role on the Rebelle team, I’m a media coordinator at a local Japanese school where I create educational resources. I hope to work in the post-production industry someday, and would love to ultimately pursue a career in teaching!  SARAH | CREATIVE DIRECTORshe/her | AriesIG: @snappedbysarahmcPortfolio: www.sarahmcintyre.myportfolio.comHi, I’m Sarah! I am the Creative Director & Photographer for Rebelle Zine. I’ve always been inspired by art & design, and found myself longingly watching behind-the-scenes videos for editorial shoots. One day I thought, “What’s stopping me from doing this myself?,” and so Rebelle Zine was born with the aim of highlighting underrepresented groups within the creative industries. My role on Rebelle Zine is pretty much my dream job. If I can find a way to make this my career, I may be the happiest person on this planet. Outside of Rebelle I am kind of a workaholic but I try to make time for personal photography/design/video projects and exploring the city. Rebelle Zine is an independent student-run production, so we need your help to make our vision a reality! Our initial goal is to raise $2000.Here’s a breakdown of what our budget will go toward : So, why should you donate to Rebelle Zine?Not only would you be helping a group of passionate students make our vision a reality, you'd also be supporting upcoming creatives of all kinds.

We performed our first show at a lovely publishing house / cafe in Skopje, met lots of cool people, and then moved on to Strumica, a much smaller city, but a much more lively and charming one. People in the streets everywhere, incredible food, and one of the coolest venues we've ever performed in! An underground bar with bikes hanging from the ceiling and just a great vibe. We had a great time hanging out with our soon-to-be audience, and then the show itself was a blast and at some point we even had much of the room up on stage participating!

I will need to be there at the beginning of May. I will begin work on the podcast when I am there, and have a small amount of money to use as a cushion while the project gets off the ground. This won't last very long, but I'm so excited about the podcast that I really want to see it grow well beyond the few weeks that I alone can afford to fund it.</p><h3>Risks and Challenges</h3><p>Anything can go wrong while traveling. We might get sick, we could be denied entry at a border, somebody may go on strike. My first Balkan kebab may not be as fresh and delicious as I'm expecting. The same goes with technology. Cameras break, computers crash, and tiny microchips get stolen. Files get corrupted. You get the idea. It happens, though. We'll adjust. The plan is to have enough of a plan that we can always bounce back somehow.<br/><br/>Otherwise, rewards can get lost or damaged in the mail. (We'll send a replacement.) World wars break out and things get delayed. (We'll keep our wits about us.)</p><p>Realistically, I've never made a podcast before, so I'm sure there'll be a certain learning curve to be dealt with. In terms of narrative, I'm not sure how it's all going to work out. There may be a sad ending. Time will tell. I've never really tried crowdfunding before, so we'll see where that goes wrong soon enough!<br/><br/>If you have any other ideas, please write as at : ""whatcouldgowrong@russianmantouristoffice.com"" (not a real address but if there's popular demand, I can make something like it!).<br/><br/>Thanks a lot!

World wars break out and things get delayed. (We'll keep our wits about us.)Realistically, I've never made a podcast before, so I'm sure there'll be a certain learning curve to be dealt with. In terms of narrative, I'm not sure how it's all going to work out. There may be a sad ending. Time will tell. I've never really tried crowdfunding before, so we'll see where that goes wrong soon enough!If you have any other ideas, please write as at : ""whatcouldgowrong@russianmantouristoffice.com"" (not a real address but if there's popular demand, I can make something like it!).Thanks a lot! I look forward to speaking with and podcasting for you all very soon!Special thanks to Jason Stoneking for having a look at the page during pre-launch and also for making and giving me the ""Occupy Putingrad"" t-shirt worn by Russian Man in the video and photos! Thanks to Chris Ebin Halkyard for the photo with the bird puppet!",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>BS Movies want to take their show on the road!</h3>
<p>Hey everybody!</p>
<p>Thanks for taking a minute to look at our campaign. We hope you'll consider helping us out.</p>
<p>BS Movies is a podcast from Phoenix, Arizona. Our names are Brian and Shelly and we have been co-hosting the BS Movies podcast for a little over 2 years now. We met at a screening of <i>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre </i>put on by a mutual friend many years ago and instantly hit it off. We stood in the lobby talking about the film for at least a half an hour afterwards. After meeting up for movies several more times we came to the conclusion that maybe we should just record thoughts on lots of different movies and share them with everyone else. And so, the BS Movies podcast was born.</p>
<p>After a highly successful year of recording together the BS Movies podcast took a totally unintended turn into producing live events. We began hosting movie screenings at FilmBar Phoenix followed by a live podcast taping discussing the film. Our first live event was Friday, December 23, 2016, when we hosted a raucous midnight screening of <i>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i> with a big crowd that was clearly having as much fun as we were. We were immediately hooked!</p>
<p>We've since hosted more than a dozen live events in Phoenix over the last two years to standing room only crowds at various different venues. It has been a totally unexpected and wonderfully fulfilling experience. Now, we'd like to start sharing this with audiences outside of the Phoenix Metro area, to do this, we need your help!</p>
<p>The previous live events we have done have been largely a labor of love with other parties migrating the costs. We've never had to pay out of pocket to rent a venue, pay a distributor for the rights to a movie, or make sure there is insurance in case of some unforeseen incident. Everything has been done with handshakes and good fortune. </p>
<p>That isn't exactly a business plan for expansion outside your local geographic area. Most venues are going to want signed contracts, which we totally understand. Thankfully, there is another great movie city close by with a perfect venue that has all the variables we need to have another successful live event. </p>
<p>We want to host a live screening at The Loft Cinema in Tucson, Arizona. The date will vary a bit depending on availability, but we are probably looking sometime in quarter 2 of 2019. We have factored in theater rental ($800), movies rights ($200-300), online and in person ticketing  ($100) and insurance ($250) in our campaign goal.  This also allows us to test the feasibility of doing this in other cities without the added expense of plane tickets and lodging. When we are done, we simply pack up our gear and drive two hours back home. </p>
<p>We have no doubt that this concept will travel well. If the Tucson screening is a success, our plan is to continue to expand to other locations across the United States. We have already started to do research on other West Coast locations for our potential options for a second road event. And since we would be taking the risk this time, a successful Tucson screening would fund our endeavors going forward. This is really just step one on our conquest for worldwide domination! </p>
<p>We want  to give you value for your donation. We have all sorts of perks to provide. Would you like to attend an invitation only movie screening and podcast taping with us? Would you like a rad limited edition shirt proclaiming that you helped us get out of town? Have you ever wanted to pick the topic we talk about on the BS Movies podcast? Would you like to join us as a guest on the podcast to discuss whatever topic you would like? Have you ever wanted to see your name in light over our logo as the top billed star of the show? All of these things can be yours in return for your generosity. </p>
<p>What are you waiting for? Let's get this show on the road!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When Birdie Ludlow leaves the big city to take a teaching position in a small, strange town in the Pacific Northwest, she soon finds out that the town is being tormented by a terrifying creature and she might not make it out alive. <br/> </p>
<h3>The World of Erie Oregon</h3>
<p>Erie Oregon is strange, full of even stranger characters. It's like Twin Peaks meets Northern Exposure. But just like Birdie, you can't help but fall in love with it. No matter how creepy.<br/> </p>

When Birdie Ludlow leaves the big city to take a teaching position in a small, strange town in the Pacific Northwest, she soon finds out that the town is being tormented by a terrifying creature and she might not make it out alive.  
The World of Erie Oregon
Erie Oregon is strange, full of even stranger characters. It's like Twin Peaks meets Northern Exposure. But just like Birdie, you can't help but fall in love with it. No matter how creepy.

<h3>Vad är Neutral Media?</h3>
<p>Idén till Neutral Media föddes när jag dokumenterade tolvslaget under 2016 års nyårsfirande på Möllevångstorget i Malmö. Det hela slutade med en <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1KzCa7E7hk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> som snabbt blev viral och spreds över hela världen. Nationell och internationell media på både höger- och vänsterkanten använde sig av filmklippet och mina uttalanden för att publicera texter i enlighet med deras politiska agendor. Dessutom inleddes en ny debatt om att förbjuda fyrverkerier i Sverige. Det fick mig att börja fundera.</p>
<p>Stämningen i samhället, inom politiken, och inte minst i sociala medier och forum är idag hatfull, destruktiv och kontraproduktiv. Inte bara ur ett politiskt perspektiv, men också socialt i mellanmänskliga relationer, där polarisering, utanförskap och psykisk ohälsa blivit tydligare än någonsin. En strävan efter problemlösning, kunskap, information, förståelse och dialog mellan meningsmotståndare har länge varit min huvudsakliga inspiration till detta projekt. Läs gärna varför jag tycker att Neutral Media behövs <a href=""http://www.neutralmedia.se/varfor-behovs-neutral-media/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">här</a>.</p>

<p>Neutral Media är en mediesatsning som till skillnad från andra kanaler, tidningar och nyhetssajter inte drivs på någon politisk eller ekonomisk grund. Neutral Media drivs ideellt och är ekonomiskt beroende av donationer. Till skillnad från andra medier publicerar inte Neutral Media några nyhetsartiklar, krönikor, ledare eller debattartiklar utan fokuserar istället på att genomföra intervjuer. Målet är att ge en ärlig bild av personen som intervjuas genom att till exempel inte försöka ”sätta dit” någon eller klippa bort delar av samtalet, men också genom att vara partipolitiskt och ideologiskt oberoende.</p>
<p>Genom att inte ha några begränsningar i vem som intervjuas kommer Neutral Media alltid vara en opartisk kanal. Neutral Media drivs i första hand av en stark nyfikenhet och en törst efter kunskap. Det främsta målet med Neutral Media är att försvaga vi-och-dom-mentaliteten i samhället genom att uppmuntra till samtal och att låta människor bilda sig en egen uppfattning – något som i slutändan förhoppningsvis kommer föra oss närmare varandra.</p>

<p>Neutral Media begränsas inte heller genom att fokusera på några speciella ämnen. Några utav dem är hursomhelst inrikes- och utrikespolitik, filosofi, kultur, religion, underhållning och samhällsfrågor. Det finns egentligen inga gränser för vem som kan intervjuas.

<h3>What is Neutral Media?</h3>
<p>The idea for Neutral Media was born when I documented the 2016 new year's celebrations on the Möllevången square in Malmö, Sweden. It ended up with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1KzCa7E7hk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> which quickly went viral and was spread all over the world. National and international media on both the rightwing and leftwing edges used the video clip and my statements according to their political agendas. Additionally, a new debate about making fireworks illegal in Sweden was initiated. This made me start thinking.</p>
<p>Today's atmosphere in society, in politics, and not least in social media and forums is hateful, destructive and counterproductive. Not only from a political perspective, but also socially in human relationships, where polarization, alienation and mental illness has become more prominent than ever. An aspiration for problem solving, knowledge, information, understanding and dialogue between opponents has been my main inspiration for this project. You can read why I think that Neutral Media is necessary <a href=""http://www.neutralmedia.se/varfor-behovs-neutral-media/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> (in Swedish, use Google Translate).</p>

<p>Neutral Media is a media project which as opposed to other channels, newspapers, and news websites is not operated on political or economic foundations. Neutral Media is driven ideally and is financially dependent on donations. As opposed to other sites, Neutral Media is not publishing any news articles, chronicles or debate articles, but is instead focusing on conducting interviews. The goal is to give an honest representation of the interviewed person, for instance by not trying to ""bust"" anyone or cut parts of the conversation out, but also by being politically and ideologically independent.</p>
<p>By not having any limitations in who will be interviewed, Neutral Media will always be an impartial channel. Neutral Media is mainly driven by a strong curiosity and a thirst for knowledge. The main goal with Neutral Media is to weaken the we-and-them mentality in the society by encouraging conversation and by letting people form their own opinion - something which in the end, hopefully, will bring us closer to eachother.</p>

<p>Neutral Media is not limited by focusing on any particular subjects. Some of them, however, are domestic and foreign policy, philosophy, culture, religion, entertainment and social issues.

<h3><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></h3>
<p>Kelly Hager is just a girl from St. Louis that was as close to dead as you can get.  Seven  years ago, she was in a coma, organs shutting down with survival being the underdog.  When she woke up she could not walk, had very little cognitive function, and could barely see.  First day out of the ICU, her husband walked in and said he wanted a divorce.  Their son was 3-years old.</p>
<p>The tribe of people who surrounded her were beyond amazing &amp; instrumental in her recovery - caring for both her and her son, Brady.   <strong>Kelly faced adversity &amp; overcame</strong>. Eventually, Kelly shared her story in small groups and big groups throughout the US and Australia.  At the end of every presentation, women flocked to her wanting to share<i> their </i>stories.     It occurred to her that so many women have incredible stories like Kelly's. <strong>Kelly wanted to do more.</strong></p>
<p>She was determined to bring these stories to life to inspire and connect women.  To show women that they can achieve beyond their current circumstances.  So, development of a docuseries began with Kelly at the helm.  That was Feb 24, 2017. Kelly reached out to Oprah's chief of staff, Libby and Libby told her that she had worked for the amazing Oprah for 11 years and she could not be Kelly's chief of staff but she would be her conduit.</p>
<p>Today, Kelly has a team of about 100 people.  A small and mighty group that are filming 104 women’s stories, developing a platform of tools, resources, mentors and coaches to help women achieve fulfillment and success.</p>
<h2><strong>Arras is a movement of positive impact for women around the world. #arraswomen</strong></h2>

<h3>Here is How You Can Invest!</h3>
<p>We need your help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding is needed to produce 104 stories, establish an online network for women, provide resources like webinars, eBooks, virtual and live networking/training events, mentoring and coaching.</li>
<li>The 104 stories is where we will start.  We will be travelling around the US, London, Haiti and Australia. The initial round of funding is extremely important to invest in the right women's stories. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you become a supporter of Arras, you are contributing to women's lives.  You are helping to equip women with the development of new skills, build confidence through engagement and connections, as well as prepare these women for their 2nd acts. There are women who want to grow, achieve more and participate differently - BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW or DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. <strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Arras can get them there --with your help!</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHFuPo1lBSA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Arras also helps break down the gender divide by preparing women in a unique way.  Through our team of mentors and coaches + the development tools we provide, women will have increased skills and confidence. </p>
<p><strong>Arras is UNIQUE! </strong> There is no organization like this with a docuseries as a platform to bring women together and then provide them with a portal for connection and resources to equip them &amp; empower them.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Our project is valuable to the world in several ways</h3>
<ol>
<li>Arras is a series of documentaries that inspire AND get the women to the resources that they need.</li>
<li>Everybody has a story. When women are vulnerable and share their stories, not only does that empower that woman but it makes them relatable to others that have similar stories. This sets the table to help women overcome their existing circumstances and plug in to achieve more. </li>
<li>Women want to engage.  We are seeing that in demonstrations, in communication, in research of what other women are achieving.  This is the launching pad.  This is the ""how-to"" playbook. This is the vehicle that can help women get from where they are today to where they want to go.</li>
<li>There are 5 pillars.  <ol>
<li>Production</li>
<li>Digital Enterprise</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Coaching/Mentorship</li>
<li>Foundation</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>We are investing in ""what is next."" </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>How we mobilize is educating ourselves. <ul><li>Arras will have E-books, Mentorship, Coaching, Training Webinars and Podcasts</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Reaching out and connecting with people, even on days when we would rather stay home<ul><li>Arras will have events, zoom calls and a digital connection</li></ul>
</li>
<li> Believing in YOU.  Taking risks &amp; working smarter and harder than you ever thought you could.<ul><li>Arras will have coaching and mentorship to drive you to YOUR goals.</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are a group of survivors.  Survivor helping survivor.  This is an authentic, genuine group of women that are making a contribution.  They are working on their second act and wanting to give back and feel fulfilled in their everyday lives. They are giving up careers.  They are walking towards a movement that is greater than themselves and some days, giving up the security of what they have known as their ""everyday"" is challenging.</li>
<li>The sum is greater than the parts and the goals are lofty.  The right team has been assembled and the drive for success is eminent!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We would love for you to contribute to Arras and help connect women across the world.  If you are not able to do that right now - no worries.  Be part of the movement anyway!</p>

</div></div>","WHO WE ARE
Kelly Hager is just a girl from St. Louis that was as close to dead as you can get.  Seven  years ago, she was in a coma, organs shutting down with survival being the underdog.  When she woke up she could not walk, had very little cognitive function, and could barely see.  First day out of the ICU, her husband walked in and said he wanted a divorce.  Their son was 3-years old.
The tribe of people who surrounded her were beyond amazing & instrumental in her recovery - caring for both her and her son, Brady.   Kelly faced adversity & overcame. Eventually, Kelly shared her story in small groups and big groups throughout the US and Australia.  At the end of every presentation, women flocked to her wanting to share their stories.     It occurred to her that so many women have incredible stories like Kelly's. Kelly wanted to do more.
She was determined to bring these stories to life to inspire and connect women.  To show women that they can achieve beyond their current circumstances.  So, development of a docuseries began with Kelly at the helm.  That was Feb 24, 2017. Kelly reached out to Oprah's chief of staff, Libby and Libby told her that she had worked for the amazing Oprah for 11 years and she could not be Kelly's chief of staff but she would be her conduit.
Today, Kelly has a team of about 100 people.  A small and mighty group that are filming 104 women’s stories, developing a platform of tools, resources, mentors and coaches to help women achieve fulfillment and success.
Arras is a movement of positive impact for women around the world. #arraswomen
 

 

Here is How You Can Invest!
We need your help!

Funding is needed to produce 104 stories, establish an online network for women, provide resources like webinars, eBooks, virtual and live networking/training events, mentoring and coaching.
The 104 stories is where we will start.  We will be travelling around the US, London, Haiti and Australia. The initial round of funding is extremely important to invest in the right women's stories. 
 


 

The Impact
When you become a supporter of Arras, you are contributing to women's lives.  You are helping to equip women with the development of new skills, build confidence through engagement and connections, as well as prepare these women for their 2nd acts. There are women who want to grow, achieve more and participate differently - BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW or DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES.  
 
Arras can get them there --with your help!

 
Arras also helps break down the gender divide by preparing women in a unique way.  Through our team of mentors and coaches + the development tools we provide, women will have increased skills and confidence. 
Arras is UNIQUE!  There is no organization like this with a docuseries as a platform to bring women together and then provide them with a portal for connection and resources to equip them & empower them.

 
Our project is valuable to the world in several ways

Arras is a series of documentaries that inspire AND get the women to the resources that they need.
Everybody has a story. When women are vulnerable and share their stories, not only does that empower that woman but it makes them relatable to others that have similar stories. This sets the table to help women overcome their existing circumstances and plug in to achieve more. 
Women want to engage.  We are seeing that in demonstrations, in communication, in research of what other women are achieving.  This is the launching pad.  This is the ""how-to"" playbook. This is the vehicle that can help women get from where they are today to where they want to go.
There are 5 pillars.  
Production
Digital Enterprise
Events
Coaching/Mentorship
Foundation



We are investing in ""what is next."" 

How we mobilize is educating ourselves. Arras will have E-books, Mentorship, Coaching, Training Webinars and Podcasts

Reaching out and connecting with people, even on days when we would rather stay homeArras will have events, zoom calls and a digital connection

 Believing in YOU.  Taking risks & working smarter and harder than you ever thought you could.Arras will have coaching and mentorship to drive you to YOUR goals.



 
Risks & Challenges

We are a group of survivors.  Survivor helping survivor.  This is an authentic, genuine group of women that are making a contribution.  They are working on their second act and wanting to give back and feel fulfilled in their everyday lives. They are giving up careers.  They are walking towards a movement that is greater than themselves and some days, giving up the security of what they have known as their ""everyday"" is challenging.
The sum is greater than the parts and the goals are lofty.  The right team has been assembled and the drive for success is eminent!


Other Ways You Can Help
We would love for you to contribute to Arras and help connect women across the world.  If you are not able to do that right now - no worries.  Be part of the movement anyway!

<p><strong>What is this all about?</strong></p>
<p>I’d often watch a film and be super excited by what I learn from it. Let’s take family movies for example. The movie may teach me to be nicer to my parents, give me a warm fuzzy feeling, and make me want to call my mother. But then I don't.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Generally it’s because I don’t know where to begin.</p>
<p>That’s why I started this blog <a href=""http://www.AliensClickHere.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.AliensClickHere.com</a> to help readers take small steps to become better humans. The cheeky title invites our alien friends to learn about us humans. But really, it’s an invitation to reflect on ourselves, one story at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Why join this movement?</strong></p>
<p>My stories usually come with simple actionable items that help improve as human beings. A lot of these stories focus on equality and cultural diversity. Although a proven talent, it remains difficult to demonstrate there is a sizable market for culturally diverse stories.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Treble began in fall of 2003 as a way of presenting fresh and thoughtful views on music. Though it started out as a casual group of friends posting thoughts on their favorite records, it’s evolved into something much more. </p>
<p>Our mission is to cover a wide spectrum of music, ranging from electronic to punk to metal to hip-hop, with a particular focus on independent and underground artists that a lot of sites never cover. We’re also dedicated to serving a diverse community, both in the subjects we cover and the people we work with, because bigotry, racism and misogyny have no place in the future of music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help </h3>
<p>It's no secret that the media industry is shrinking, especially when it comes to music sites that cover smaller artists. Some sites get bought out by larger corporations, others simply shut down. We need your help to keep us going.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>First, you’ll get to feel good about supporting independent journalism! And to prove how much we value that, <i><strong>every contributor will get a handwritten note from our founder on a postcard from our vintage postcard collection.</strong></i></p>
<p><strong>If you donate $20 or more, you get a koozie! </strong>Keep that drink as cool as your record collection!</p>

It’s going to handle exploration, loss, fear, and family, and hope – what it means to be alive, and what it means to be human – the things that drive us towards adventure, and the things that pull us closer to one another. I hope all my stories do that. And, I have to admit, this story, it just feels like such a natural next step because on the one hand – I FINALLY get to write about dinosaurs. And on the other hand, I have really REALLY missed writing my sea-monster babies.”</p><p><strong>The story begins</strong> when a long extinct sea creature washes up on the shores of Coney Island. Marine biologist Dr. Marella Morgan is contacted by a secret organization to investigate the origins of the creature’s sudden and unnatural resurgence.

We create stories, set in the wildest corners of the universe, to explore just what it means to be human. Primordial Deep is an ongoing adventure/thriller, set in the expanded universe of No Such Thing's first series, Janus Descending. Written by Jordan Cobb, with sound design by Julia Schifini and music by Daryl Banner, the first season of Primordial Deep will be comprised of seven (7) episodes, each approximately 45 minutes in length.“I’m building a universe,” Cobb explains, “I’m only half joking when I say I’ve got a constellation of stories moving through my head. You can take them individually, or look at them as they fit into the whole. I want to tell stories that inspire others to tell stories – to seek out the strange and wonderful things in their worlds by letting them explore mine. Primordial Deep is the next step. It’s going to handle exploration, loss, fear, and family, and hope – what it means to be alive, and what it means to be human – the things that drive us towards adventure, and the things that pull us closer to one another. I hope all my stories do that. And, I have to admit, this story, it just feels like such a natural next step because on the one hand – I FINALLY get to write about dinosaurs. And on the other hand, I have really REALLY missed writing my sea-monster babies.”The story begins when a long extinct sea creature washes up on the shores of Coney Island. Marine biologist Dr. Marella Morgan is contacted by a secret organization to investigate the origins of the creature’s sudden and unnatural resurgence. Soon, she and a team of experts find themselves living on the research station The Tiamat, traveling along the abyssal plains as they search for answers far below the waves. But there are dangers in these ancient waters. Reawakened, prehistoric monsters are rising from the deep -- jaws wide and waiting, and in the darkness, something is stirring.  Who We AreJordan Cobb is the creator of Primordial Deep, as well as the voice of Dr. Marella Morgan, and Official Multiple Hat Wearer of No Such Thing Productions. As both a writer and an actress, she spends the majority of her time dreaming up new worlds, and doing everything she can to bring them to life. Now, she's poking her head out of her nest of paper and ink, with yet another story to tell, and the fervent hope that you'll join her for the adventure...Julia Schifini is our sound designer extraordinaire, lured into crafting our wild and vivid soundscapes with promises of an ancient pirate's treasure map, and a specially reserved space on the Tiamat's life boats. Her work with No Such Thing Productions' Janus Descending was her first foray into professional sound design, and she has been recognized for her incredible work on several ""Best of 2018 Podcasts"" lists.Daryl Banner is our composer, and his carefully crafted scores bring depth and color into our stories, and hang the constellations our imaginary skies. Primordial Deep is the third of Jordan's projects he has helped to set to sea, and he has been professionally composing music and writing his series of adult novels, full time since college. How Can I Help?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I started Unashamed &amp; Unapologetic: The Mental Un-Health Podcast 2 years ago, interviewing friends and other guests about their personal experiences. I provide a platform for people to share their stories and for listeners to relate on their experiences with mental health. Eliminating stigma and  shame over cocktails and conversation is the aim of this podcast. </p>
<p>I have had so much growth within the podcast and am now in need of better quality recording and editing equipment, in order to take production to the next level. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise at least $2000</p>
<p>Your contributions will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new laptop- I originally started this podcast with my old Mac that I used throughout college. It's definitely served me well, but it's on it's last leg.</li>
<li>New microphones- I started off with condenser mics, which are great for starting off. Dynamic microphones, provide better sound quality and give a smoother listening experience.</li>
<li>New dope graphics for podcast MERCH! T-shirt sales have been a huge success, and I plan on creating even more podcast merchandise for listeners. </li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of support I have had thus far is unreal, and I am so grateful for you continued support. </p>
<h3>PERKS</h3>
<p>Not only are you contributing to an amazing project, but you will receive special perks ranging from a shout out on the show, to podcast merch and a 30 min. Q&amp;A consultation. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Unashamed &amp; Unapologetic Podcast has made it possible to reach individuals around the world who struggle with shame and stigma about their mental health issues. By hearing the stories of other people who may look and sound like them, and have gone through similar experiences it sheds light to the fact that we are not alone in our experiences and don't need to be ashamed of them. By discussing such widespread issues in a casual, comedic way, it normalizes them, and shows that it is ""okay to not be okay"" and that you can accept yourself just the way you are, flaws and all. </p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to contribute financially, you can still be a part of the movement by  listening to the podcast on any streaming platform, liking, following and subscribing to the podcast social media pages! Rating and leaving a review on Apple Podcasts will help it move up in the charts!</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the major complaints we’ve seen in the audio drama community is the lack of a central database of creators and shows. Artists and listeners alike want a resource where they can find new shows, starting their search with a particular genre, creator, or show.</p> <p>This is where we come in. The Directory of Independent Audio Drama will fill that need, providing a central resource where users can easily find the information they want. Started by two librarians, the Directory is meant to be a streamlined, easy-to-utilize website where users can explore new genres, find more shows from their favorite creators, or just scratch the itch of wondering who voiced that character.</p> <p>However, we need your help to get this site off the ground. This campaign is intended to raise the money we need in order to get the website up and running. So if you are an audio drama creator, fan, or both, your contribution will help create a wide-ranging, thorough resource for our community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is set at $550, which will go toward the costs of launching the site. This includes hosting, Wordpress costs, and paying a professional graphic designer.

However, the creation of the site might take place on a longer timeline.</p>

<p><i>1% inspiration, 99% perspiration</i></p>
<p>One of us will work with you on a small project, parameters to be agreed upon after the campaign ends. For example, Therin will run or participate in a D&amp;D one-shot with you and your friends (for a podcast, or just for fun). One of us will collaborate with you on a short story. One of us will write you dirty (and probably terrible) fanfiction about whatever characters you want. We'll loan you our (fairly limited) voice acting abilities for an episode of your show. We'll talk about it! The power is yours! This level also includes all rewards from all previous levels.</p>
<p>(This level requires your mailing address in order to send the letter. We'll be emailing all supporters at this level before perks go out. OR you can email it to us at indieaudiodrama@gmail.com.)</p>

The Directory of Independent Audio Drama podcast will invite creators on to talk about their shows and their craft. Dive deeper into the audio dramas included in the directory!</p>

Stretch Goals

 
Should we go beyond our goal, our first stretch goal is to bank enough money to cover three years of hosting. Should we reach $1100, that’s where things will get interesting. Stretch goal number 2 is the big one. If we hit double our stated goal, we’ll get back behind the mic ourselves. The Directory of Independent Audio Drama podcast will invite creators on to talk about their shows and their craft. Dive deeper into the audio dramas included in the directory!

<h3><strong>Who we are and what we are doing</strong></h3>
<p>THE WELL WITH ANSON MOUNT AND BRANAN EDGENS is a podcast concerned with creativity and inspiration. Guests have included scientists like Dr. Douglas Vakoch of the SETI and METI institutes, actors Eva Longoria, Doug Jones, musicians Xibit and Alice Cooper amongst many others. For season three we want to celebrate our growing audience with a special episode that explores the very foundations of human creativity and inspiration. THE WELL host Branan Edgens will spend one week in a jungle on a tropical island with noted survival coach Tom McElroy to learn how to survive using only a knife. The resulting episodes will consist of in-depth interviews with Tom combined with Branan's experience surviving in the wilderness. THE WELL currently has no advertising and no operating budget and is produced entirely out of our own pockets. We do it because we value our freedom to pursue the stories that interest us in ways we find personally compelling.  </p>

<p>This IndieGoGo will cover the costs of paying everyone involved, helping us keep the same high standards we had for season one and create season two on a faster timeline.

<h3><strong>About the crew: </strong></h3>
<p>I’m Michelle Nickolaisen, the writer and creator of Unplaced. I had the idea for it after a particularly rough patch of my life, where I started to feel disconnected from everything around me.</p>
<p>I scripted season one in March of 2017, had it beta-read and edited by May 2017, and started releasing in October (launching on Friday the 13th! ? ). I anticipate the turnaround time from finished scripts to launch to be much faster for season two, due to not having to find my main actor or an audio engineer. I’ve also successfully completed and <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bombchelle/the-freelancer-planner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fulfilled a Kickstarter before</a>, so I have experience managing crowdfunding campaigns and projects of this scope.</p>
<p>In addition to me, there’s Cole and Brendan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cole Burkhardt is the primary voice actor/the mostly-unnamed narrator for season one.</li>
<li>Brendan Hutchins is the audio engineer/editor/sound designer and soundtrack composer.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be more actors for season two, but we haven’t started auditioning yet.</p>
<h3><strong>Cost breakdown: </strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is set for $3,000, which will cover all of the audio production costs (possibly with some money left over — we’re working off a rough estimate right now, as I have outlines and some scripts for season two, but don’t have runtimes yet for the episodes). That still leaves me paying the actors for season two out of pocket, but that's a cost I can cover if I have to. </p>
<p>If we reach that goal, whatever we raise over the initial goal will go towards paying the actors. After that, funds will go towards increasing the hourly rate for the actors, then for paying for me to take time off work to finish season two faster. </p>
<p>If we don’t meet the goal, I’ll put whatever money we do receive to paying for production costs, and season two will still happen — it just might be on a slower timetable. </p>
<h3><strong>Stretch goals: </strong></h3>
<p>Of course, we'd love to cover more than the base cost for audio engineering, which is why we have a whole host of stretch goals! </p>
<ul>
<li>$3,500: We'll release an “audiobook” version of Unplaced season one (all of the episodes cut together in one file without the outros)</li>
<li>$4,000: We'll give season two the audiobook treatment as well, and release it to backers once we're done recording/producing S2 </li>
<li>$4,500: Everyone backing at $25 and higher will get a physical script book with all of the scripts for seasons one and two </li>
<li>$5,000: We'll do a public, remastered re-release of season one</li>
<li>$5,500: We'll record behind-the-scenes commentary audio for each episode of season one</li>
<li>$6,000: We'll record behind-the-scenes commentary audio for each episode of season two</li>

I'm inviting you to help me reach two of my main goals, which are: </p><p>1,000 individual donors<br/>Raise £6,000 together</p><p>Not only would the money make a real difference in the quality of content I'm able to create, it would also be mean that I could get the word out about Pigletish and help it reach people who may need it. The money would go towards:</p><ul>
<li>Making sure I can work on Pigletish full time, without compromising my own mental health by working two jobs. </li>
<li>Marketing - while social shares have been by far the most effective way of reaching new people, I've also learned that sponsored posts really pack a punch when it comes to spreading the word! </li>
</ul><p>If you are already one of my readers/listeners, first of all THANK YOU! I wouldn't be able to raise awareness without you, and your messages of support and thanks really make all the work totally worthwhile. Secondly, if you each donated £3 today, I'd reach my goal within 24 hours (Wow!). </p><p>Think about it, that's just 1 fancy coffee at Starbucks, or just over a pint, or a sandwich, or half a hat that costs £6 in the sale at Accessorize.

Through your encouragement and support, it has grown into 2 blogs and a podcast that has reached over 13,000 people in 69 different countries. </p><p>The site continues to grow because it runs on the simple idea that talking to each other about mental illness and sharing our experiences helps us feel better understood and less isolated.

I can also tell you anecdotally that I have had several messages from my readers/followers that pigletish has helped you build the courage to speak up about your own illnesses and seek help. </p><p><b>Real Goal</b></p><p>I've talked about my funding goal above, but I think it's really important that you understand my REAL GOAL, which is this: </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">To reach as many people as possible with my two main messages</p><ol>

I'm inviting you to help me reach two of my main goals, which are: 1,000 individual donorsRaise £6,000 togetherNot only would the money make a real difference in the quality of content I'm able to create, it would also be mean that I could get the word out about Pigletish and help it reach people who may need it. The money would go towards:
Making sure I can work on Pigletish full time, without compromising my own mental health by working two jobs. 
Marketing - while social shares have been by far the most effective way of reaching new people, I've also learned that sponsored posts really pack a punch when it comes to spreading the word! 
If you are already one of my readers/listeners, first of all THANK YOU! I wouldn't be able to raise awareness without you, and your messages of support and thanks really make all the work totally worthwhile. Secondly, if you each donated £3 today, I'd reach my goal within 24 hours (Wow!). Think about it, that's just 1 fancy coffee at Starbucks, or just over a pint, or a sandwich, or half a hat that costs £6 in the sale at Accessorize. It isn't very much money, but it will make a HUGE difference to me and ultimately to my readers, followers and listeners. Thank you so much for being a part of this, I couldn't do it without you! AnneliAbout PigletishThe site was launched in March 2017 and is dedicated to raising awareness for Anxiety, PTSD and other chronic and mental illnesses. Initially, the site was set up as a way for me to document my journey to recovery from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (and all it's hideous symptoms), following an abusive relationship. Through your encouragement and support, it has grown into 2 blogs and a podcast that has reached over 13,000 people in 69 different countries. The site continues to grow because it runs on the simple idea that talking to each other about mental illness and sharing our experiences helps us feel better understood and less isolated. I don't know how many of you that I have helped directly with my work, but I do know that you have all helped me. I can also tell you anecdotally that I have had several messages from my readers/followers that pigletish has helped you build the courage to speak up about your own illnesses and seek help. Real GoalI've talked about my funding goal above, but I think it's really important that you understand my REAL GOAL, which is this: To reach as many people as possible with my two main messages
Hey. It's OK to be ill. 
You're not alone.
Messages which I think are being missed among all the sunset shots and bikini pics that is social media. I want to use my platform to make people feel better about themselves, not worse.  SuccessesSome of the Articles have been featured in Huffington Post UK, Quiet Club org and mentioned by BBC's Quite Interesting on Social Media. Other organisations who have shared my content and/or plan to work with me in the future include Women's Aid, The Blurt Foundation, Refuge, Mind Charity and Rethink Mental Illness.

<h2>Attention Brimstone Valley Mall Shoppers!</h2>
<p>Brimstone Valley Mall is a fast-paced fiction comedy podcast about four demons from Hell who work in a shopping mall in the 90s. This 9-episode first season will be chock full of quippy dialogue, 90s references, dark humor, and of course, a goth garage band (whose lead singer goes mysteriously missing). To sum it up, Brimstone Valley Mall is a nostalgic love letter to suburban mediocrity and trashy mall culture - and that love letter comes dressed in black from head to toe (from Hot Topic, of course).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Our Budget Breakdown</h3>
<p>Does $8000 sound expensive for an indie podcast? You're right! It is.</p>
<p>We may be cretins from the underworld, but even we want to pay our cast/crew a fair wage for their talent, time, and hard work. That means paying NYC prices for our recording space, our actors, and designers.</p>
<p>We also believe that you as supporters deserve full transparency about where your money goes. So, here is our full budget breakdown: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Actors</strong>:<ul>
<li>Main Cast: $50 x Episode = $1675</li>
<li>Featured Supporting Cast: $50 x Episode = $600</li>
<li>Walk on/Cameo Roles: $10 x Episode = $350</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Recording Space: </strong><ul><li>
<strong>​</strong>28 hours of recording time in a NYC recording studio = $1680</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Sound Designers</strong>:<ul><li>Paying our team of two sound designers for a 9 episode season = $2670</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Production Costs: </strong><ul>

<strong>​</strong>Show art = $400</li>
<li>Custom Music = $100</li>
<li>Indiegogo Fees = $400</li>

<h3>Gifts4Goths</h3>
<p>What perks do you get out of this? Well, that depends on how goth you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Goth</b> <strong>($5) </strong>- At this tier you'll be listed as a supporter on our website! </li>
<li>
<strong>Really Really Goth ($25) </strong>- At this tier you'll receive the previous reward, as well as a custom <u><a href=""https://twitter.com/bvmpod/status/1174456135685935105"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ms paint demon makeover</a></u> that will get shouted out on our social media channels! You'll also receive a BVM button and sticker package!</li>
<li>
<b>Head to Toe Goth ($50)</b> <strong>- </strong>At this tier you'll receive all previous rewards, along with exclusive access to a short blooper reel from inside our recording sessions! Your name will also be read out in thanks at the end of an episode of Season 1 of Brimstone Valley Mall!</li>
<li>
<b>Goth to the Core ($100) </b>-  **THE FIRST TEN DONORS AT THIS TIER GET A LIMITED EDITION BVM TOTEBAG!** At this tier you'll receive all previous rewards, and access to  extended blooper reels, both from our recording session and from the writers meetings!

</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any comedy, timing is <i>everything</i>. Our cast is funny as Hell, but even these comedy ghouls need to record in the same room to make this quippy back-and-forth dialogue land just right. </p>
<p>This means the biggest challenge that we foresee is monetary. Herding 7 actors at a time into a professional recording studio in NYC will not come cheap, but we think the upfront costs will be very very worth the lasting quality (both sound-wise, and performance-wise).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Brimstone Valley Mall is a monstrous glaring beacon of capitalism in an otherwise also completely capitalistic world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Shadow Opera is a creative collective specialising in innovative music theatre. We explore new ways of making and sharing opera with the curious. </p>
<p>Drawing on the <strong>true story </strong>of Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper — two female Victorian poets and lovers who lived and wrote under the pseudonym, Michael Field — our opera podcast brings to life the story of these two extraordinary women. </p>
<p>Combining operatic vignettes, sound design and interviews, with a libretto assembled from Michael’s journals and poetry set to new music by <a href=""https://www.tom-floyd.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tom Floyd</a>, we promise listeners a rich and entertaining audio experience, revealing the sensual, fantastical and witty world of Michael Field and his struggle with Victorian patriarchy.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has been a devastating year for theatre-making, but <strong>the show must — and can — go on</strong>. All  stages of this project can be completed in even the most severe lockdown restrictions, and the lower production costs of an audio-based project mean that <strong>at least 80% of the funds raised will go directly to the singers, instrumentalists, sound team and other creatives involved.</strong></p>
<p>Recording begins in January, with episodes released every two weeks from February. Your support will help employ a brilliant team of creatives to bring this powerful story to life, and enable us to share it with a larger audience than we've ever reached before. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's a difficult time to be fundraising, but we know you don't want to see our vibrant arts scene wither. We're spreading our fundraising campaign across 3 income streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Arts Council England national grant bid</li>
<li>Private sponsorship</li>
<li>This Crowdfunding campaign </li>
</ul>
<p>We are looking to secure the majority of our funds through grants and sponsorship, however, the support given to our crowdfunding page will be crucial to us in achieving this. <strong>It's not what you give that's important: just giving <i>something</i> helps us show there's an audience out there, backing us.</strong></p>
<p>As well as the warm, fuzzy feeling of supporting the arts in these difficult times, we will also be offering supporters perks, including <strong>Veritable Michael merch</strong>, <strong>a special bonus episode</strong> and<strong> live-streaming events.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>This project will help Shadow Opera in its quest to dismantle some of the barriers between opera and mainstream audiences. We think there's huge potential in bringing opera into the world of podcasting and docudramas, both of which have exploded in recent years.</p>
<p>Your support will be help us bring the drama of opera into the more intimate world of podcasting,  exploring a completely new way of making opera, and helping it find new audiences along the way. You will also be helping us provide safe, exciting work for singers, instrumentalists and other creatives during this precarious time for artists. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Like with anything new there are risks to all this. Maybe the world isn't ready for an operatic docudrama podcast series? But if that's the case, it's not a world we want to live in!</p>
<p>Our talented team brings together creatives who have worked for organisations including the Royal Opera House, English National Opera, Scottish Opera, English Touring Opera, Grange Park Opera and more, and we're confident we'll make something audiences find compelling.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>No matter how small, every donation matters</strong>, but there are loads of <strong>other ways to support this project</strong>. We will be working hard to bring this podcast to as wide an audience as possible, and you can help us by:</p>
<ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Shadow Opera is a creative collective specialising in innovative music theatre. We explore new ways of making and sharing opera with the curious. 
Drawing on the true story of Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper — two female Victorian poets and lovers who lived and wrote under the pseudonym, Michael Field — our opera podcast brings to life the story of these two extraordinary women. 
Combining operatic vignettes, sound design and interviews, with a libretto assembled from Michael’s journals and poetry set to new music by Tom Floyd, we promise listeners a rich and entertaining audio experience, revealing the sensual, fantastical and witty world of Michael Field and his struggle with Victorian patriarchy.
Covid-19 has been a devastating year for theatre-making, but the show must — and can — go on. All  stages of this project can be completed in even the most severe lockdown restrictions, and the lower production costs of an audio-based project mean that at least 80% of the funds raised will go directly to the singers, instrumentalists, sound team and other creatives involved.
Recording begins in January, with episodes released every two weeks from February. Your support will help employ a brilliant team of creatives to bring this powerful story to life, and enable us to share it with a larger audience than we've ever reached before. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
It's a difficult time to be fundraising, but we know you don't want to see our vibrant arts scene wither. We're spreading our fundraising campaign across 3 income streams:

An Arts Council England national grant bid
Private sponsorship
This Crowdfunding campaign 

We are looking to secure the majority of our funds through grants and sponsorship, however, the support given to our crowdfunding page will be crucial to us in achieving this. It's not what you give that's important: just giving something helps us show there's an audience out there, backing us.
As well as the warm, fuzzy feeling of supporting the arts in these difficult times, we will also be offering supporters perks, including Veritable Michael merch, a special bonus episode and live-streaming events.
 

Impact
This project will help Shadow Opera in its quest to dismantle some of the barriers between opera and mainstream audiences. We think there's huge potential in bringing opera into the world of podcasting and docudramas, both of which have exploded in recent years.
Your support will be help us bring the drama of opera into the more intimate world of podcasting,  exploring a completely new way of making opera, and helping it find new audiences along the way. You will also be helping us provide safe, exciting work for singers, instrumentalists and other creatives during this precarious time for artists. 
 

Risks & Challenges
Like with anything new there are risks to all this. Maybe the world isn't ready for an operatic docudrama podcast series? But if that's the case, it's not a world we want to live in!
Our talented team brings together creatives who have worked for organisations including the Royal Opera House, English National Opera, Scottish Opera, English Touring Opera, Grange Park Opera and more, and we're confident we'll make something audiences find compelling.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
No matter how small, every donation matters, but there are loads of other ways to support this project. We will be working hard to bring this podcast to as wide an audience as possible, and you can help us by:

sharing this campaign through your social network
sharing (not just ""liking"") our social media
following us on Twitter @ShadowOpera, on Instagram @Shadow_Opera and like us on Facebook @ShadowOperaGroup


joining our mailing list to follow the project
shouting about the project to anyone who will (or won't!) listen

 
Any support you can give, finanical or otherwise, is greatly appreciated!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For one thing - this show is free!<br/><br/>We'll level with you - even with the support and foundation of MICE (Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo), even the fact that this is a one-day show, even with the little bit of income we'll receive from exhibitors and sponsorships, this show isn't easy or inexpensive. And have we mentioned that it's free? <br/><br/>Take a look at our overall budget below of $10,000. We're aiming for $3000 each in terms of revenue from exhibitor table fees and sponsorships from local / national companies. That leaves about $4000 dollars left that we need to raise. </p>

<ul>
<li>​<strong>Special Guests</strong>: we want our guests to be compensated for their time, effort, and travel. We're hoping to have enough in our budget to pay panelists too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Exhibitors</strong>: While exhibitors aren't paid, we want to make sure they're taken care of and happy during the show. We're borrowing a concept from MICE and will have Happiness Officer volunteers, checking in with exhibitors and making sure they feel safe, taken care of, fed, caffeinated, watered, and generally provided for. </li>
<li>
<strong>Helping Out Creators in Need:</strong> A portion of our budget will be set aside for audio fiction creators who may not have the means to attend or exhibit on their own. Your donation could really make the difference in getting someone out there, spreading the news about their show. </li>
<li>
<strong>Venue, Advertising, &amp; Operations:</strong> Much of this goes without saying. We can't have a show unless we have the space, time, energy, and advertising to set it up, work it, and let people know about it. Plus, we need to pay for legal advice, and even the taxes we receive from the revenue for the show (including this IndieGogo campaign). </li>
</ul>
<p>As for what you get for your contribution?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Credit!</strong> For one thing, you get to feel good about contributing to the only festival dedicated to audio fiction in the United States, and we'll list you on our website, or possibly even the show program. </li>
<li>
<strong>Fun PodTales Merchandise!</strong> Including stickers, pins, t-shirts, and more. Just look at that cute little mouse logo. You know you want one! </li>
<li>
<strong>Service Awards!</strong> We'll create your very own flash fiction prose PodTale for you. Or we'll sound design an audio fiction piece of your very own. How cool is that?</li>
<li>
<strong>Sponsorship!</strong>  At this level, you help make the show possible, so you get all the benefits that come with that. Credit, your own exhibition booth, your own advertising - whatever perk we have, you've earned it. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>PodTales plans to focus specifically on the work of indie creators who are still building their audiences. Your support can literally help build the profiles of independent fiction podcasters of all sizes, as we provide a safe, friendly space for creators to network and learn from each other, no matter what their experience is. What makes us sure we can do that? </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've never done this before, so of course there's a risk. We wouldn't be asking for your help if we didn't need it. Not only that, we want this festival to continue beyond this year, so there's pressure on us to succeed. That being said, we feel confident that we'll be able to deliver on our promises. Why?</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Jessica Marshall and I've been drawing story sketches for animated TV shows and movies for almost 10 years.  I've spent a lot of time making likable characters find friendship, purpose, and self-esteem.  They've gone on high adventures and sang passionately about wanting to belong in a confusing world.  And after the 2016 election cycle, I never felt more like one of those characters.   I became a news junkie before the winner was even announced, asking the same questions many were: What is a superdelegate?  What's the difference between a caucus and a primary?  Does my vote even matter?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572326719/pixfpfu6rzh6xsf4doet.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I remember as a kid there were shows like <i>Schoolhouse Rock</i> that broke down how a bill became a law and the Preamble to the Constitution.   Are there shows now that speak about our government's inner workings?  I have yet to find them.  And Schoolhouse Rock, although beloved, seems pretty dated.  It was released 43 years ago.  <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572387019/ngplswiv4k7z432dxmr2.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>I was suddenly on a mission to create an animated series that would teach simple civics lessons like on <i>Schoolhouse Rock</i>, with music, but with narrative storytelling from a kid's point of view.  What if ​<i>Glee</i> boarded the ​<i>Magic School Bus </i>and took a ride to ​<i>The West Wing.  </i>But with the insanity of this political climate, it feels as if time is of the essence.  And being that my resources are limited I've decided to produce the idea as a kids narrative podcast. </p>
<p>I believe the idea is solid and the message is more vital than ever before.</p>
<p>The podcast will be a six-episode season to launch in February (the beginning of primary season and the 2020 election).  But I need your help.   I am overjoyed to report that many talented people have stepped forward to help me create this show. </p>
<p>And for their efforts and dedication, they deserve compensation.  I am no Scrooge McDuck and so I need to raise funds to pay for talent and equipment. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we need &amp; What you get</h3>
<p>You see it.  And you're on board to help us start a conversation about civics with the future generation of voters.   But you've got questions.  What would I do with the money you contribute to this campaign?  The money will pay for writers, voiceover talent, musicians, sound editors/technicians,  recording space, web services, perks, and advertising. </p>
</div><div>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am confident we will create a fantastic podcast that will be well received.  I know this just from the talent that has already stepped forward to join me on this mission.  The obstacle that we have to overcome is awareness.  I'm sure that the more people know about this project, the more they will agree that there is a need for shows like this that teach the value of being an engaged citizen. </p>
<p>We plan to cast a wide net to attract attention through social media groups within the animation, political and educational communities.  Our podcast will have characters that represent the American experience at large.  We hope that kids from all over the States will see our characters as friends to cheer for and become inspired by their ability to affect change at their elementary school through civic action. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand it may be difficult for everyone to donate.  But please don't let that stop you from telling others about our campaign and our mission with the podcast.  If you can hum a couple of bars about that sad little bill sitting there on Capitol Hill,  then you know the impact a fun song can have on a kid.  Please use the Indiegogo share tools and help us make some earworms for the next generation.  </p>
</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Hi, I'm Jessica Marshall and I've been drawing story sketches for animated TV shows and movies for almost 10 years.  I've spent a lot of time making likable characters find friendship, purpose, and self-esteem.  They've gone on high adventures and sang passionately about wanting to belong in a confusing world.  And after the 2016 election cycle, I never felt more like one of those characters.   I became a news junkie before the winner was even announced, asking the same questions many were: What is a superdelegate?  What's the difference between a caucus and a primary?  Does my vote even matter?
  
I remember as a kid there were shows like Schoolhouse Rock that broke down how a bill became a law and the Preamble to the Constitution.   Are there shows now that speak about our government's inner workings?  I have yet to find them.  And Schoolhouse Rock, although beloved, seems pretty dated.  It was released 43 years ago.  
I was suddenly on a mission to create an animated series that would teach simple civics lessons like on Schoolhouse Rock, with music, but with narrative storytelling from a kid's point of view.  What if ​Glee boarded the ​Magic School Bus and took a ride to ​The West Wing.  But with the insanity of this political climate, it feels as if time is of the essence.  And being that my resources are limited I've decided to produce the idea as a kids narrative podcast. 
I believe the idea is solid and the message is more vital than ever before.
The podcast will be a six-episode season to launch in February (the beginning of primary season and the 2020 election).  But I need your help.   I am overjoyed to report that many talented people have stepped forward to help me create this show. 
And for their efforts and dedication, they deserve compensation.  I am no Scrooge McDuck and so I need to raise funds to pay for talent and equipment. 
 
What we need & What you get
You see it.  And you're on board to help us start a conversation about civics with the future generation of voters.   But you've got questions.  What would I do with the money you contribute to this campaign?  The money will pay for writers, voiceover talent, musicians, sound editors/technicians,  recording space, web services, perks, and advertising. 

And what do you get in return?  Well first, all your dollars will go into bringing you and your kids a fun podcast to sing along to in the car.  Hopefully, it will start good conversations with them about freedom of speech or why we vote...and keep them entertained all the way to school!
Being that this is a podcast we have unique opportunities to honor your contributions.  Whether it is a shout out at the end of the show, naming a character after you or your child, or giving you the most prominent title of executive producer.  We have also made some campaign buttons and bumper stickers to promote the show and Gloria's run for Student Body President.
If we do not reach our financial goal... the funds will still go to this endeavor.  We will just have to find other ways to raise the remaining dollars.  We will also make cost-effective choices to make the project the best it can be with the resources we receive from you- our constituents.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For those of you who don’t know me, I spend my time immersed in all issues relate to accounts payable. Now, before you start rolling your eyes, let me also share that this will be my 20<sup>th</sup> book, and about three-quarters of those books are about accounts payable issues. It is a lot more complicated than it sounds … unless you don’t mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting ripped off by fraudsters,</li>
<li>Paying for inefficient processes,</li>
<li>Paying some invoices twice (no, most vendors do NOT return the second payment),</li>
<li>Late fees</li>
<li>Losing early payment discounts</li>
<li>Getting in trouble with the IRS for inaccurate or incomplete reporting</li>
<li>Similar problems with the SEC</li>
</ul>
<p>… and more. The list goes on but I’m guessing you might be beginning to see why this is a more complex topic than it appears at first glance. And these problems existed before being exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis which cast a spotlight on some weak practices, enables some new frauds and made remote working a reality for many.</p>
<p>Time, at least for me, is a precious commodity. But there are only so many hours in a day. We were supposed to go on a cruise in May and I’m guessing you can figure out what happened there. The silver lining to that lost cruise is I had three weeks with no work planned; no articles to write, no talks to give etc. – and no place to go, either.</p>
<p>While we are pretty serious at AP Now, given the nature of our work, we also do like to have a good laugh occasionally. For a long time, I’ve wanted to find a way to include some cartoons in my books. For, people who work in accounts payable have some pretty funny encounters from time to time. So, with my extra time, an introduction from a friend, and hopefully a little backing from you, a cartoonist was hired.</p>
<p>He’s bringing the ideas I’ve been saving to life. Each chapter of this softcover book (and there are about 25 of them) will start with a cartoon, based on “Life in Accounts Payable.”</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The book will have three distinct components:</p>
<ol>
<li value=""NaN"">The book itself with the latest best practice advice and insights. This will be the largest part of the book, probably 90%</li>
<li value=""NaN"">The cartoons</li>
<li value=""NaN"">A resource section, where readers can find information about the some of the product offerings to help with the accounts payable function.</li>
</ol>
<p>While we are pros at producing the first component, the second two (cartoons and resource section) are new to us.</p>
<p>Our primary goal of this campaign is to get the book in the hands of as many professionals at reasonable a price as possible. These are the people who regularly read our newsletter, come to our webinars and participate in our surveys. They are accounts payable managers, directors and supervisors; controllers, accountants, auditors and CFOs. And of course, the service providers. The first three perks below are for you.</p>
<p>But we also want to get the word out. We have devised a three-part strategy to gain eyeballs to our best practice information and to the service providers who offer innovative solutions to the accounts payable community. This will be executed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A companion listing of the resources shown at the back of the book will be put on the AP Now website. It will stay live through the end of 2020.</li>
<li>A Limited Series of 10 Best Practice Podcasts. These are posted on the AP Now website, YouTube and many other podcasting sites.</li>
<li>A social media campaign to draw attention to best practices (Linkedin, Twitter and Facebook).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Deliverable</strong>: The product is a softcover book, which will be sold after publication for $39.95 + shipping and handling. Our goal is to have all copies of the book ordered at the pre-publication price in the mail no later than August 15th, if not earlier!</p>
<p>Will you help me spread the word by backing this project? The special perks shown below were designed just for you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The book will be published, whether we meet the goal or not. It is almost completely written and well, this is my 20<sup>th</sup> book – so clearly, I can get this type of project completed in a timely manner. If we don’t meet the goal, the social media program will be scaled back.</p>
<p>Your support means that not only can we get this book published, but we can also publicize it widely. I believe wider publicity not only translates into more sales but equally important (at least to me) is that it will help bring wider recognition for the hard work the accounts payable teams are doing for their companies.</p>

<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>There are many ways you can help us get the word out (whether you contribute or are just a believer in what we are trying to do). Here are a few:</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What's this all for?</h3>
<p>It's been quite a long time since I've gone a week without seeing friends online bemoan a lack of low-stakes fiction podcasts. Something with plenty of humor to offset the hundreds of amazing-yet-stressful shows currently running, let alone real life.</p>
<p>Enter <i>Standard Docking Procedure</i>, a workplace sitcom set on a cantankerous middle-of-nowhere space station. With a diverse cast and some elbow grease I'm ready to produce hell of a podcast. All the fun and worldbuilding of sci-fi without waiting for the penny to drop that the alien race du jour is the writer's commentary on racism, sexism, or both at the same time. Meanwhile, with a predominantly LGBTQA+ main cast, we'll be delivering the finest sitcom scenarios but without all of the unfortunate homophobic/transphobic/fatphobic jokes found in a lot of older traditional television sitcoms. </p>
<p>Nobody's going to suddenly die, nobody's going to suddenly contract a terminal illness. Everything isn't going to go perfectly fine for the characters, it's a story after all, but rest assured we're all leaves on the wind. We'll gently float from story to story together, and that's that. Love, acceptance, and that dangerous feeling of wealth on payday prevail on Pseudopolis. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While a lot of excellent fiction shows are produced with little to no vocal talent, I want to buck the trend and make something that makes <i>everyone </i>involved feel better at the end of the day, not just the listener. </p>
<p>I have a freelance writing job that offsets my existing costs for editing software and podcast hosting. Producing three existing podcasts means I've got the existing ecosystem to act as director/producer/editor/writer/sound designer. I can ""pay"" my way by dedicating time I'm not at my real job to the show, but voice actors can't live off ""Gavin could be playing Mario Party right now"" bucks. Voice actors do a hell of a lot of work for not that much recognition/reward in podcasting, I want to help change that in what ways I can. The pilot episode alone has four main characters and six supporting roles, and they all knocked it out of the park. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Where the Money's Going</strong></h3>

<p>See, I wasn't kidding. The lion's share of the campaign will go towards paying voice actors, with a small percentage set aside for crowdfunding fees and a small provision to upgrade the podcast's website once season one is officially underway. </p>
<p>And, of course, I have some fun perks one can only get by supporting the show! If you've heard <a href=""http://dockingpod.com/2018/12/23/space-steaks-part-one/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the pilot episode</a>, you might still be wishing for a piece of Carloni's 3D pizza. Well, wish no longer! Pledges from $1 up get a file that'll allow them to print out and assemble one of Carloni's delicious* cubes. Pledge at the $25 level and we'll send you a pre-printed version along with every other physical item offered!</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>*As tasty as they look, the cube is indeed still just paper. Learn from my mistakes.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge the show faces right now are lack of funding. If the campaign does not meet its goal we will produce whatever amount we can afford and then SDP will go on hiatus until such time as I've saved up enough from my real-world spare income to produce another episode, which would change the release schedule to once every few months.</p>
<p>I've kept The Red Light Library and Tuned In, Dialed Up running consistently with only occasional scheduling hiccups for quite some time. Editing and sound design are my passion. If I can keep voice actors gainfully employed, episodes will flow. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course, you can also help SDP without spending any money as well! Spread the word on social media, send the pilot episode to your friends!

<h3>Hello...?</h3>
<p>Hello. My name is <strong>John David Booter</strong>. I've never made a podcast. The last few years have been full of ups and downs. I was savagely betrayed by my fiancee Lisa, gained 287 pounds and <strong>made an eight episode podcast.</strong></p>
<p>To my surprise and delight, <strong>DONE DISAPPEARED</strong>, the documentary podcast investigative podcast I created with my bare hands, took off at lightning speed.</p>
<p>By Episode 2, we had <strong>won The Award for Best New Podcast</strong> and were given a key to the city of Davistown Pennsylvania.  We also <strong>tripled our Patreon goal</strong> of zero dollars a month and got the incredible news that<strong> DONE DISAPPEARED</strong> was<strong> becoming a TV Show Starring me, John David Booter</strong>. And that was just the beginning. </p>
<p><strong>Hundreds and hundreds of millions of listeners tuned into Season 1.</strong> The world was riveted and heartbroken by the disturbing case of Clara Pockets, a Pennsylvania woman who went missing in 1987. There were many twists and turns in the investigation and <strong>by the end of our podcast</strong>, <strong>thanks to</strong> you our listeners and to <strong>me John David Booter</strong> and my podcast Done Disappeared with me John David Booter...  <strong>Clara Pockets was found. </strong>Also thanks to Davistown Police and everyone involved in the investigation over the last thirty years.</p>
<p>But Clara Pockets wasn't the only one who'd been found by the end of my investigation into her disappearance. There was someone else. Someone who had somehow slowly faded away into nothingness over the course of the last few brutal years. That someone was me, John David Booter. And with my podcast, DONE DISAPPEARED with me John David Booter, <strong>I</strong>, John David Booter, <strong>found myself, John David Booter.</strong></p>
<p> And now? We still have<strong> lingering questions in the case of Clara Pockets</strong>. Such as: Why? Where did she go? Who took her? What happened to her? Is she doing okay? What's she been up to? Where is her family? Is there a God? and May we speak with him?</p>
<p>We intend to address these questions in the future. But for the most part,<strong> Season 2 will focus on a NEW CASE</strong>. Last Season, we covered the case of Clara Pockets and eventually caused her to be discovered. <strong>This season, we're doing something a little different. </strong>We're tackling a case that took place decades ago, in a time almost nobody knows anything about. A time before cell phones, before drones and just after the bicycle was invented. That's right.</p>

</div></div>","Hello...?
Hello. My name is John David Booter. I've never made a podcast. The last few years have been full of ups and downs. I was savagely betrayed by my fiancee Lisa, gained 287 pounds and made an eight episode podcast.
To my surprise and delight, DONE DISAPPEARED, the documentary podcast investigative podcast I created with my bare hands, took off at lightning speed.
By Episode 2, we had won The Award for Best New Podcast and were given a key to the city of Davistown Pennsylvania.  We also tripled our Patreon goal of zero dollars a month and got the incredible news that DONE DISAPPEARED was becoming a TV Show Starring me, John David Booter. And that was just the beginning. 
Hundreds and hundreds of millions of listeners tuned into Season 1. The world was riveted and heartbroken by the disturbing case of Clara Pockets, a Pennsylvania woman who went missing in 1987. There were many twists and turns in the investigation and by the end of our podcast, thanks to you our listeners and to me John David Booter and my podcast Done Disappeared with me John David Booter...  Clara Pockets was found. Also thanks to Davistown Police and everyone involved in the investigation over the last thirty years.
But Clara Pockets wasn't the only one who'd been found by the end of my investigation into her disappearance. There was someone else. Someone who had somehow slowly faded away into nothingness over the course of the last few brutal years. That someone was me, John David Booter. And with my podcast, DONE DISAPPEARED with me John David Booter, I, John David Booter, found myself, John David Booter.
 And now? We still have lingering questions in the case of Clara Pockets. Such as: Why? Where did she go? Who took her? What happened to her? Is she doing okay? What's she been up to? Where is her family? Is there a God? and May we speak with him?
We intend to address these questions in the future. But for the most part, Season 2 will focus on a NEW CASE. Last Season, we covered the case of Clara Pockets and eventually caused her to be discovered. This season, we're doing something a little different. We're tackling a case that took place decades ago, in a time almost nobody knows anything about. A time before cell phones, before drones and just after the bicycle was invented. That's right.
 Season 2 will cover a crime that took place in the 1980's!
We've already learned so much about the 1980's in our research for the upcoming season and cannot wait to appropriate the aesthetic of this magical decade for our true crime podcast.
But to do that? We need your help!!

<p>The Starty Pants Show</p>
<p>There have been many efforts to raise up and celebrate people from a diversity of backgrounds, black and brown people, LGBTQIA folks, and differently abled people. We want to be part of the solution to the lack of representation of diversity in the entrepreneur and start up space.</p>
<p>Often funders and advertisers will pass over the opportunity to invest in people who are serving a market that is geared toward women, black and brown people, non-english speaking people, LGBTQIA people and differently abled people. Starty Pants will be producing a great quality show and will be seeking funders, advertisers and sponsorship dollars but to do that we will need to have a proven track record. We have already begun production and have the first two episodes recorded. The first episode airs October 25 and we will aim to air a new episode every week. The funds generated from this campaign will be used to create more content so that we can move to a once weekly schedule. There is no lack of people to feature!</p>
<p>Starty Pants will be available in audio and video formats, across all the key platforms airing video and audio podcasts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We set our Goal at $5,000</p>
<p>The reason we set our goal at $5,000 is because we want to ensure that we have enough funds to create at least 6 more episodes. Right now, our production costs for each episode averages appoximately $750. This only covers our filming and editing. After our 6th episode, our production costs will increase because we have worked out a start up deal with the production facility we are using.</p>
<p>We also want to be able to print a run of shirts and stickers. Which is a great segue into our perks. </p>
<p>THE PERKS</p>
<ul>
<li>For people who contribute $15 we will send you a Starty Pants sticker. We will have vinyl die cut stickers and you will love yours!</li>
<li>Contribute $75 and you'll receive a t-shirt and a sticker.</li>
<li>$100 will get you a special shout out on an episode plus the t-shirt and sticker.</li>
<li>$500 or more will get you a posting on our Supporters page on Startypants.biz, and all previously mentioned perks.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, the funds will first be spent to obtain the first run of shirts and stickers. This will ensure the people who contributed and are eligible for that perk receive it. And then all other proceeds go directly to the production costs of future episodes.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe Starty Pants is important and needed for a number of reasons. Representation and celebration are the two most important reasons we believe Starty Pants needs to be produced. We imagine a wide variety of people will be interested in watching or listening to Starty Pants, including people who are interested in learning about being an entrepreneur, people who are curious about business and people who don't know anyone who has started a business before.</p>
<p>We also want the opportunity to celebrate the hard work and interesting ideas of people who are not often celebrated by mainstream outlets. Sometimes they aren't celebrated because they don't know the right people to get in front of mainstream media or because they aren't serving a market that the mainstream outlets recognize as being important.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk Starty Pants faces is the length of time it might take to gain some traction. It can take a long time for people who are interested in the topics and ideas we are covering to find us. This means that it could take a long time before we start generating enough revenue to continue to produce content.</p>
<p>We are convinced that there are plenty of people out there who are tired of not seeing everyone being represented that people will not only share what we are doing here but that we will also find sponsors.</p>

<p>Even if you can't contribute, you can still help. Here are a few of the things you can do to help!</p>

<p>Riding on an overwhelming swell of gratitude, I decided to do something to celebrate Game of Thrones and the amazing community that has sprung up around it by raising money for the podcasters who help make that community what it is as well as a charity that defends the rights and equality of everyone.  </p>
<p>To that end, I've gathered 10 of the top Game of Thrones podcasts together to produce a special episode of their show <i>exclusively</i> for this project.  Introducing the Game of Thrones Charity PodPack!</p>

<p>When you purchase any MiniPack or PodPack, you're getting access to episodes produced exclusively for this project!  They have not been released anywhere else.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Katie, I'm 39 and I'm having a midlife crisis! Up until now I've been kind of floating through life, I've had some good adventures, but they've kind of happened to me, rather than me making them happen. Now I'm trying to create an adventure! <br/>My goal is to create a manual for myself and others to navigate these weird life transitions we all have to face. I'll be doing that in three ways:</p>
<p>1. A blog, where I reflect on what it is I'm thinking, feeling, learning and doing.</p>
<p>2. A YouTube channel where I can create a visual collage of what I'm learning, doing, where I'm traveling, and how I'm traveling. </p>
<p>3. The most ambitious part of this project: a book, based on structured conversations with other people. My current thought on this is that it will be a way to document how others deal with life transitions, relationships, growth and change. It will likely evolve with time, but I want to know what strategies people employ in their every day lives to get along.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need some help to kick this off. I can do it on my own, but with a little extra backing I could really get this up and running! This campaign is designed to help me get my first trip under my belt. Here's what I'd like to use the money I get from this for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campground fees</li>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Activities</li>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Listen, there are so many risks and challenges it'll be impossible to list them all. The main challenge for me in this project is keeping my motivation and consistency high.  One thing I've learned about myself over the last year is, that I thrive on keeping myself accountable to a community. I want you to hold me accountable for making this project kick-ass.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
Hi! I'm Katie, I'm 39 and I'm having a midlife crisis! Up until now I've been kind of floating through life, I've had some good adventures, but they've kind of happened to me, rather than me making them happen. Now I'm trying to create an adventure! My goal is to create a manual for myself and others to navigate these weird life transitions we all have to face. I'll be doing that in three ways:
1. A blog, where I reflect on what it is I'm thinking, feeling, learning and doing.
2. A YouTube channel where I can create a visual collage of what I'm learning, doing, where I'm traveling, and how I'm traveling. 
3. The most ambitious part of this project: a book, based on structured conversations with other people. My current thought on this is that it will be a way to document how others deal with life transitions, relationships, growth and change. It will likely evolve with time, but I want to know what strategies people employ in their every day lives to get along.

What We Need & What You Get
I need some help to kick this off. I can do it on my own, but with a little extra backing I could really get this up and running! This campaign is designed to help me get my first trip under my belt. Here's what I'd like to use the money I get from this for:

Campground fees
Gas
Activities
National Park Entrance Fees
Compensation for the hours I'm missing work

What will you get in return? Well that depends on your level of donation but here's some of what I have in mind.

Credit on videos and a dedicated page on my website
Your name read at the end of my videos
Photos and videos not released to the public at large
Your choice of a framed print of a good photo from this first trip
A photo book of the best images from my trip
My undying love


The Impact
I'll be honest, taking on this trip on my own, while doable, is going to mean a lot of Top Ramen for me, but with a little help this trip will be a lot more comfortable for Monroe and for myself. I'll be able to breathe a little easier, but also it will enable me to make the content so much better, by allowing us to do more, explore more, and meet more people. Beyond that your support will mean that you also think this isn't the worst idea in the world. I strongly believe it's worth talking to people about how they move in life, and how they see the world.

Risks & Challenges
Listen, there are so many risks and challenges it'll be impossible to list them all. The main challenge for me in this project is keeping my motivation and consistency high.  One thing I've learned about myself over the last year is, that I thrive on keeping myself accountable to a community.

<h3><strong>Help Us Educate the World About the Uses of Hemp</strong></h3>
<p>This summer, award-winning Hemp <a href=""https://www.lancasterfarming.com/community/podcasts_and_audio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Podcast</a> producer Eric Hurlock is taking the show on the road to give national attention to the hemp industry, farmers, and hemp's endless eco-friendly uses. He’s loading up the RV and embarking on a cross-country hemp fiber and grain tour of farms, processors, and manufacturers from North Carolina, Kentucky, Colorado, Montana and beyond. </p>
<p>Eric will create compelling content every step of the way including videos, podcast interviews, print/digital articles, social media posts &amp; more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise $3000 for fuel costs, tolls and RV camp stops. Every dollar will go into this educational initiative. If we reach over our goal, the funds raised will go to a non-profit supporting the hemp industry. Depending on the amount you give when you back the tour, you can also have your name or business you represent listed each week in the Hemp Tour update section of our weekly newspaper, <a href=""https://www.lancasterfarming.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lancaster Farming</a>, a mention in a Hemp Tour podcast episode and a 1 year subscription to Lancaster Farming Newspaper!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Many Uses of Hemp</strong></h3>
<p>In December of 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law. It removed hemp from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) making it federally legal to grow in the U.S. Since then, farmers across America have be relying on the crop to support their families and helped to create more eco-friendly alternatives to many products you use every day.</p>
<p>When talking about hemp currently, the mainstream media generally focuses on the biggest boom from the 2018 Farm Bill thus far, CBD and its medicinal uses but the future of hemp is goes far beyond than that.</p>
<h3><strong>Here are some examples of what hemp can be used for:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Biofuel for vehicles</li>
<li>Building material (concrete, insulation, plaster, ropes wood, varnishes)</li>
<li>Biodegradable plastics</li>
<li>Livestock feed and bedding</li>
<li>Protein-rich food and healthy oils </li>
<li>Paper</li>

<h3>Why Get a Booth?</h3>
<p>Theology of Games has brought (in our opinion) great quality content to the gaming industry for nearly 6 years, however quality content is just the beginning of finding success as a content creator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not familiar with Theology of Games? Check us out at TheologyofGames.com. We publish written articles on the boardgaming industry; news, reviews, and interviews. We also produce three (yes, THREE!) podcasts: The Theology of Games Podcast (monthly), That's How I Roll (weekly) and Boardgames FM (DAILY!). And we recently rebooted our YouTube Channel with our Take-Two Reviews!</li>
<li>Our campaign on Indiegogo is a launching point for us to go from hobby to profession. Having a physical presence at one of the largest conventions in North America not only helps us strengthen our relationship with our loyal fanbase, but an opportunity to connect with thousands of potential new fans. The funds raised here will be used to defray the costs of: booth registration fees, booth displays, hotel accommodations for booth workers, written promotional materials, onsite advertisement, new gear to help us live stream via Facebook, YouTube and more, contest prizes and more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Suffice to say, we have big plans for Origins 2018, and we simply can't achieve these goals without you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're not only appealing to our fans, friends, and family but to our existing friends within the gaming community:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're look to raise $3,000 to pull this off the way we envision it.</li>
<li>The break down of our costs goes something like this:</li>
<li>We've secured an entrepreneurial booth registration for $450</li>
<li>A room for us to stay in will be approx. $1,000</li>
<li>Booth decor (still gathering quotes) approx. $400</li>
<li>Promotional materials (Stickers, flyers, handouts, T-Shirts, etc.) approx. $500</li>
<li>If we go over our set goal we are looking into some new gear to help us live stream from the exhibit hall floor.</li>
<li>For personal backers we have some great TOG branded rewards</li>
<li>We've already registered for our booth! This is happening whether we hit our goal for funding or not, Your support helps us have a great and successful convention and produce quality content while we're there!</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>As always with crowdfunding campaigns it's easy to question what your money will be used for, we hope we've been honest and upfront with you in our description and with the rewards we're offering.</li>
<li>The biggest challenge will be if we way under fund. We have to book a hotel, order booth gear, etc. While every dollar helps, if we don't hit our goal we'll have to do a bit of scrambling to make things happen at the level we aspire to.</li>
<li>As we said in our video, we aren't going anywhere, we've got our booth space, and we'll be at Origins. The level of funding we raise through our campaign will determine (to some degree) how well we are able to execute our plans for Origins!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We totally get it! Not all of you can toss a coin in the cup, no pressure! But if you want to help us there are plenty of ways to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media, social media, social media! Your ""likes"" and ""shares"" and posts about our campaign help us go viral, and deliver the message to folks who might be interested in helping out.</li>
<li>If you scroll up there are a ton of buttons to click to help spread the word!</li>

<h3>The Sustainable Baker</h3>
<p><i>The Sustainable Baker</i> podcast is coming to Spotify and Apple Podcasts this fall to explore baking in the era of climate crisis!</p>
<p><strong>The host</strong><br/><br/>I’m Caroline Saunders. I'm producing this podcast because I wanted to know: will dessert survive climate change?! Baking touches esoteric dessert and daily bread alike. So through the lens of baking, we can learn a lot about climate impacts on food security and food culture. I've worked in climate news for five years, and I'm the co-author of a book called <i>Craft Beef</i>. This fall, I'm moving to Paris to train in pastry at Le Cordon Bleu.</p>
<p><strong>The season</strong></p>
<p>The Sustainable Baker will tackle the questions you didn't <i>know</i> you needed to ask, like...</p>
<ul>
<li>Just how at-risk are the ingredients we bake with?</li>
<li>Will cake as we know it go the way of the Dodo bird and the Greenland ice sheet?</li>
<li>What adaptations are underway to help all the things we bake survive the climate crisis?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Sustainable Baker is also a mini audio cookbook for the next, hotter stage of life on earth. Each episode will have accompanying recipes posted to sustainablebaker.com.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>My work so far, and how you can help</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Through Objects is an online platform based on the communication of design objects. A curated selection of new products of design, their analysis and current trends identified via trendsobserver.com (digital platform of trends and innovation).</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>What’re the main questions and trends underlying design objects? Why are these questions relevant to the current world and consumers? Do they reflect any reaction to current cultural and behavior trends? These are the type of questions that we want to answer with the designers’ collaboration.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>We will try to tell you how society is living and which solutions product designers are thinking about in order to respond to these needs. For this, we will add top contributors from different countries creating interesting articles to our online publication while producing relevant insights to our future E-books.</p>
<h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3>
<p>This project was created by Rita Trindade in 2016 as a final project of a post-graduation at college of Letters – University of Lisbon. Along with trendsobserver.com (Scientific Trends investigation group of University of Lisbon), this project relates the trends identified by <i>trendsobserver.com</i> to new projects and objects of designers at a global level. Until now, through-objects.com had more than 40,000 page views, mostly from United States, Portugal, Germany, France and Denmark.</p>
<h3><strong>Our objective</strong></h3>
<p>Our objective is now to provide more valuable content from different collaborators around the world, as well as exclusive trend reports and articles to our subscribers. To achieve this goal we'll have to be sure we can fairly pay to our talented contributors, in order to provide an exceptional quality content on our platform.</p>
<p>It is our ambition to keep on improving our content quality, while providing a deep storytelling experience exploring rational and emotional connections we all have with the design objects.</p>
<p>Our main goal would allow us to post:</p>
<p>- 20 online pieces of journalism about design stories from our contributors,</p>
<p>- 6 E-Books produced with the collaboration of different contributors, addressing specific design issues, design stories and relevant experiences from designers to our community.</p>
<h3><strong>Join us</strong></h3>
<p>With our crowdfunding our team will create more three to six months of compelling stories and E-books with exclusive interviews and professional’s opinion about the future of design. With your help we will work hard to communicate you the best of design, as well as the most meaningful stories.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Rein and I do voicework - most notably audiobook production.  If you're here it's probably because you're familiar with my current ongoing project, <a href=""http://parahumanaudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Parahuman Audio</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years many people have approached me looking for ways to donate to or support me in the creation of the various works I am involved in.  Most notably is the creation of the unofficial audiobooks for the web serials <a href=""https://parahumans.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Worm</a> and <a href=""https://www.parahumans.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ward </a>by J.C. McCrae.  You can listen to the former <a href=""http://audioworm.rein-online.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and the latter <a href=""http://parahumanaudio.com/ward-audiobook/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.  As part of the author's policy on derivative works I am unable to make money on those productions so I've always had to turn down prospective contributions and any other forms of revenue.  I have also been involved with other works such as the <a href=""http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Metropolitan Man audiobook</a> and <a href=""http://projectstellar.libsyn.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Project STELLAR</a>, a couple indie games, as well as <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/rein-791413208"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">various random things</a>.</p>
<p>After some thought and deliberation I've determined an avenue for people to contribute that they can directly benefit from and will not cause problems with the original author: funding real audio equipment to improve sound quality going forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So why am I doing this? </h3>
<p>Well, audio equipment is expensive and my current setup (BLUE Yeti USB) works fine but has some issues both technically and with quality (watch the video to hear the difference a better mic can make!).  Better equipment would be a great boon to my work, but for something that I don't get paid for it's hard to justify the expense.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>With these funds I will be acquiring the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microphone: Shure SM7B ($399)</li>
<li>Interface/Preamp: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Studio (2nd Gen) with XLR cable and studio monitors ($249.99)</li>
<li>Acoustic Panels ($23.50)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total cost: $672.49 + tax</p>
<p>Assuming the full $700 is funded I'll actually only end up getting $644 after Indiegogo has taken their cut, but I'm fine with handling whatever the difference is.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that the project gets over-funded then the remainder will go toward hosting costs for the Worm Audiobook project and Parahuman Audio sites.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>What, you mean you don't just care about improving the quality of my work that you've listened to for free for years?  Well alright then - may I interest you in some bespoke recordings that vary in length depending on how much you contribute?</p>
<p>Each tier offers the same service with the only thing different being how much of it you get.  I will send you a fully edited recording of whatever your heart desires up to the length specified in your contribution.  Seriously, I'll record whatever you want however you want it.  Rap battles, a portion of your favorite book, the speech from Independence Day, poorly written fanfiction, etc.  I'm sure you can think of something outrageous that I could never imagine, and that's (probably) okay too!</p>
<p>You will also get access to the Parahuman Audio Discord server where you can chat with me and the editors.</p>
<p>Some things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>I reserve the right to turn down any request.  I'm incredibly difficult to offend and have practically no shame, but I won't do anything that I think might be used for harm (like recording a ransom note) or something that might get me in trouble.</li>
<li>I will work with you to make sure your recording is just what you want.  This will include a few retakes if necessary.</li>
<li>The recordings will be done on the new equipment unless you specify that you want it sooner, which means it will be on the Yeti.</li>
<li>Let me know if you have a time limit (like a birthday or something) on your recording so I can try to prioritize it.</li>
<li>You will have ownership of whatever recording I create for you.  If I really like it I may ask you to let me put it on my soundcloud or something.</li>
<li>If this campaign doesn't reach its goal then I will still be acquiring this equipment, however depending on how short we get it may take longer than I would like.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only real risk here is that we don't make it anywhere near the goal.  In that case I will still buy all the equipment, but it will likely take me longer than anticipated to buy all of it (probably not until shortly after the new year).</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, if this somehow gets thousands of backers (doubtful) then fulfilling everyone's custom recordings will take me a while.  I'll still get to all of them, but depending on how much work goes into each it will probably take some time.  Unless you have a critical need I plan on fulfilling requests in the order they were received.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sharing this campaign with other people would be great, but even better would be sharing the <a href=""http://audioworm.rein-online.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Worm</a> and <a href=""http://parahumanaudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ward Audiobook</a> projects with everyone you know.  At the very least I ask that you please support <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/Wildbow/overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">J.C.

My name is Rein and I do voicework - most notably audiobook production.  If you're here it's probably because you're familiar with my current ongoing project, Parahuman Audio.
Over the years many people have approached me looking for ways to donate to or support me in the creation of the various works I am involved in.  Most notably is the creation of the unofficial audiobooks for the web serials Worm and Ward by J.C. McCrae.  You can listen to the former here and the latter here.  As part of the author's policy on derivative works I am unable to make money on those productions so I've always had to turn down prospective contributions and any other forms of revenue.  I have also been involved with other works such as the Metropolitan Man audiobook and Project STELLAR, a couple indie games, as well as various random things.
After some thought and deliberation I've determined an avenue for people to contribute that they can directly benefit from and will not cause problems with the original author: funding real audio equipment to improve sound quality going forward.
 
So why am I doing this? 
Well, audio equipment is expensive and my current setup (BLUE Yeti USB) works fine but has some issues both technically and with quality (watch the video to hear the difference a better mic can make!).  Better equipment would be a great boon to my work, but for something that I don't get paid for it's hard to justify the expense.

Total cost: $672.49 + tax
Assuming the full $700 is funded I'll actually only end up getting $644 after Indiegogo has taken their cut, but I'm fine with handling whatever the difference is.
In the unlikely event that the project gets over-funded then the remainder will go toward hosting costs for the Worm Audiobook project and Parahuman Audio sites.
 
What You Get
What, you mean you don't just care about improving the quality of my work that you've listened to for free for years?  Well alright then - may I interest you in some bespoke recordings that vary in length depending on how much you contribute?
Each tier offers the same service with the only thing different being how much of it you get.  I will send you a fully edited recording of whatever your heart desires up to the length specified in your contribution.  Seriously, I'll record whatever you want however you want it.  Rap battles, a portion of your favorite book, the speech from Independence Day, poorly written fanfiction, etc.  I'm sure you can think of something outrageous that I could never imagine, and that's (probably) okay too!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This fundraiser sets the tone for the entire second phase in the life of JS-1 &amp; Aries Lounge. We have always been under funded, short on equipment and short on resources.  This fundraiser will allow us to give you the artists, businesses, family, friends and fans the opportunity to empower us to reach the goals we have set for ourselves &amp; empower others around us to create ground breaking content. We will be able to bring more to light more of Baltimore's history, more professional shows, more professional visuals and more compelling content you want to see!! </p>
<p>Jamal Smith aka JS-1 Tha Supplier has created a number of successful platforms that have reached huge groups of people and have impact 1,000's of lives! Here just a few projects we have raised money for and had great success:</p>
<p>1) <strong>The Media Impact Awards 2019:</strong> The awards ceremony created to celebrate local media in Baltimore both major and independent. We brought out 294 attendee's. (Impact Awards 2020 coming soon)</p>
<p>2) <strong>VVCRadio.com:</strong> created in 2007 with no money and grew into a major local platform in Baltimore between 2014-2018. (it is now in dormant until we can find new investment.)</p>
<p>3) <strong>VVCLife Magazine:</strong> created in 2014 we have released 4 magazines each distributing 1,000's of physical copies throughout Baltimore for free with the help of Advertisers &amp; supporters.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Baltimore Entertainment Book:</strong> We created this resource guide to give people an easy to read book proving media platforms and their contact inform. We also highlighted local business in Baltimore. We printed over 1,000 physical books and a free digital book for people to use as a resource.</p>
<p>Jamal &amp; the Aries Lounge/ VVC team have been dedicated to creating fun, informative, impactful content and products for over a decade. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges we face are simple. We don't have any major corporate sponsorship, nor do we have mega stars promoting our platform. So with out the support of our friends, supporters, artists and business relationships we won't be able to provide the type of content everyone wants to see us do. We also slow down our ability to shoot the documentaries we are working on and side projects we have planned to release via our social media and youtube channel. </p>
<p>Lastly Jamal has been funding everything for all these platforms since the beginning. At 40 years old, he can't afford to keep spending money on it. He has family to take care of and personal needs he must fund with his own money. So we ask for your support help take this project to the next level.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send the link out to Artists who want album reviews or interviews</li>
<li>Subscribe to our youtube channel ""vvclife"" and watch our current content, share and comment on all the videos.</li>
<li>Follow us on social media, like media and help us promote our cause.</li>
<li>The biggest support you can give is citizism and ideas to help us do our best!! We always encourage our base to speak up so we can give our viewers what they want.</li>

How Are Ya Now?
We at the PodScure network/podcast as well as the How Are Ya Now?

<p>(You can see the list of our goals and stretch goals below, and get more detail in our <a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-how-much-money-are-we-aiming-to-crowdfund"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">editorial </a>on the subject.)</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543606284/m83vyjhgcpl8hvquu74i.png"" src=""""/></h3>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In 2016 a group of writers launched <a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anime Feminist</a> as a platform for analysis of Japanese pop culture through a feminist lens. Our goals were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>build a platform for underrepresented voices</li>
<li>transform the critical landscape with fresh perspectives</li>
<li>pay everyone fairly</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past two years, we've cultivated a pipeline of diverse writers, a dedicated editorial team, and an engaged community of fans. We have a healthy <a href=""https://patreon.com/animefeminist"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a>, through which we've earned a reputation for being ethical, transparent, and financially responsible. </p>
<p>By any measure, we've been successful in our goals. </p>
<p>So successful, in fact, that we're bursting at the seams. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543606284/m83vyjhgcpl8hvquu74i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Patreon income covers all our running costs... from 8 months ago.</p>
<p>Our traffic has increased, which means our hosting costs have too.</p>
<p>Our private community has grown, so we need to pay community managers to moderate it. </p>
<p>Our pipeline is so full we sometimes have to freeze pitches, even though we only publish 5 pieces a week right now. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Just to keep pace with our own organic growth</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>, we need more money. </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>To fulfil our <a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-the-future-of-anime-feminist/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ambitions</a> of becoming a hub for feminist fans of anime and manga and hiring employees (and treating them well), we need a <i>lot </i>more money. </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543606284/m83vyjhgcpl8hvquu74i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Our next step should be to actively market our work and develop new content... but we can't justify doing either until we fix two fundamental flaws in our infrastructure:</p>
<p>1. Our website is hard to use, not accessible, and isn't able to support our ambitions<br/>2. Our podcast, Chatty AF, has no transcripts</p>
<p>These two flaws are our only obstacles to growth. Big statement, but it's indefensible to spend money on marketing an unsuitable website, or on developing new content when our existing content is inaccessible.</p>
<p>So we need to fix both, as soon as possible - which requires a five-figure lump sum of cash. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543606284/m83vyjhgcpl8hvquu74i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Opportunity</h3>
<p>To raise enough money through Patreon to overhaul our website and transcribe over 90 hours of audio would take months, maybe years.</p>
<p>Through this crowdfunding campaign, we'll be able to fund both in a matter of days. </p>
<p>With those two flaws fixed, we'll finally be able to enhance what we offer, experiment with new content, and explore bolder possibilities entirely. </p>
<p>We just have to meet our goal first. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543606284/m83vyjhgcpl8hvquu74i.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Our goal is $19,900. We recently broke this number down <a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-how-much-money-are-we-aiming-to-crowdfund/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">in detail</a>, but to summarize: </p>
<p>Milestone 1: At <strong>$6,410 </strong>we'll be able to cover all external campaign running costs <strong>- CLEARED!</strong><br/>Milestone 2: At <strong>$12,660 </strong>we can fund our website overhaul <strong>- CLEARED!</strong><br/>Milestone 3: At <strong>$17,910 </strong>we can pay for transcriptions for all Chatty AF episodes to date <strong>- CLEARED!</strong></p>
<p>GOAL: At <strong>$19,900, </strong>we'll be able to cover all internal campaign running costs as well <strong>- CLEARED!</strong></p>
<p>Every stage of meeting our goal involves paying <a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-who-will-get-the-money-we-crowdfund/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">members of our community</a> a fair rate for their work. When you help us reach 100%, you'll be supporting a culture of fair pay for creative work in geek spaces. </p>

<h3>Incentives</h3>
<p>As a thank you to our community for supporting us in this campaign, we're offering something you've been requesting for a long time: AniFem's first ever merchandise!</p>
<p>We're creating a limited edition range of carefully selected items, each featuring a distinct design from original illustrations we've commissioned just for this campaign. This range is exclusive to backers of this campaign, and will not be available anywhere else. </p>
<p>After the campaign ends, AniFem merchandise of any kind will be unavailable until we have the funds to open an online shop, commission new designs, and set up a solid infrastructure for production, shipping, and customer service.</p>
<p>Depending on how successful this campaign is, this could take some time... so make sure to get hold of any items you want while you can! </p>

<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>Our community has a track record of stepping up when we ask, so we fully expect to meet this goal. As a thank you, we've then crafted and costed stretch goals to meet our <strong>top 3 most popular community requests</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>CLEARED! </strong>Stretch Goal 1: at <strong>$20,500</strong> we can create a recommendations page each for:</p>
<ul>
<li>general feminist-friendly series</li>
<li>positive LGBTQ+ representation</li>
<li>series that are good for children or teenagers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CLEARED! </strong>Stretch Goal 2: at <strong>$22,500</strong> we can build a straightforward review database featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>a centralized, ordered list of every review we write</li>
<li>a basic system enabling you to tell at a glance if we recommend a series or not</li>
<li>links to full episode reviews so you can click through for more detail</li>
</ul>
<p>Stretch Goal 3: at <strong>$25,000 </strong>we can pay to:</p>
<ul>
<li>integrate an online shop into our website</li>
<li>brand it in line with the rest of our online presence </li>
<li>design our first range of merchandise to sell through the shop</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Stretch Goal 4 is <strong>$30,000 </strong>- see Further Goals below for details of what it will fund.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543606284/m83vyjhgcpl8hvquu74i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Further Goals</h3>
<p>Beyond $25,000 things get even more interesting. Our plans here involve funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>experiments</strong> to work out whether - and how - to offer our community new streams of content <ul><li>e.g. the production of a single video essay so we understand the budget required to produce such videos on a regular basis and can raise funds accordingly</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>behind-the-scenes projects</strong> to help us run more efficiently<ul><li>e.g. a social media audit and overhaul to make our online presence pro-active, consistent, and data-driven</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>research into bigger ideas</strong> to understand how best to develop them <ul><li>e.g. attending two representative events in order to understand how best to make events part of our growth strategy</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If it looks like we're heading towards $25,000, we'll cost and prioritize as many more goals as we need to ensure that you always know where your money will go next. </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Our final stretch goal, Stretch Goal 4, will be $30,000, bringing us $5,000 to fund all of the above in early 2019. </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>Any project comes with risks, and we've done our best to identify and mitigate them right from the planning stages.</p>
<h3>Under-funding</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is of course that we don't meet our goal, which has more <a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-what-happens-if-we-dont-meet-our-crowdfunding-goal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">negative consequences </a>for AniFem than may be obvious at first. </p>
<p>However, choosing flexible funding, breaking down our goal into milestones, and prioritizing our campaign running costs means that backers can be confident of receiving the perks they've paid for - unless we fall short of our first milestone of $6,410. </p>
<p>It is of course <i>possible </i>that we could fall that badly short. Our target market includes many marginalized fans, who are more likely in general to have less spare cash. That part of our base could well be unable to support us at this time of year, no matter how thorough or compelling our case, to the point that we fail to break even our first milestone. </p>
<p>However, we can say with confidence that it's highly unlikely. </p>
<p>For starters, our community has a track record here. When we ran a fundraising drive for a four-figure sum exactly this time last year, we met our goal within three days. Some even asked how they could contribute more than the $20 limit. </p>
<p>We've marketed as smartly as possible so that our community feels comfortable and prepared to support us, including publishing a series of pre-launch editorials explaining:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-the-future-of-anime-feminist/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">why we're crowdfunding</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-what-happens-if-we-dont-meet-our-crowdfunding-goal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">what happens if we don't meet our goal</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-who-will-get-the-money-we-crowdfund/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">who gets the money we raise</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-how-much-money-are-we-aiming-to-crowdfund/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">how much we're aiming to raise</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This marketing motivated almost 200 members of our community to register their intentions to contribute on our pre-launch page. Based on these numbers and our community's typical response to our fundraising activities, our chances of falling short of $6,410 are very low. </p>
<p><i>(<strong>UPDATE: </strong>We met our first milestone in just 5 hours, and reached 100% of our goal the following day.)</i></p>
<h3>Delayed perks </h3>
<p>After under-funding, the biggest risk is that we take longer than expected to send you your perks. We're still in the development process for the merchandise designs, and there is always a chance that incomplete work can go awry.</p>
<p>It's for this reason that we chosen to work with <a href=""https://www.animefeminist.com/editorial-who-will-get-the-money-we-crowdfund/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">low-risk partners</a>: an <a href=""http://www.teriarchibbles.com/illustrations"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">illustrator</a> who is a member of the AniFem community, and merchandise and shipping suppliers who came recommended by personal contacts. It's highly unlikely that any of these established professionals will let us down. </p>
<p>In addition, we've consistently made our financial estimates conservative, which gives us some buffer. If something were to go wrong in a way that had cost implications, we have enough leeway built into our calculations that we should be able to absorb any reasonable unexpected costs. </p>

</div></div>","UPDATE
38 hours: We've raised 100% of our goal!
40 hours: First stretch goal met!
Day 10: Second stretch goal met!
(You can see the list of our goals and stretch goals below, and get more detail in our editorial on the subject.)


 
Background
In 2016 a group of writers launched Anime Feminist as a platform for analysis of Japanese pop culture through a feminist lens. Our goals were to:

build a platform for underrepresented voices
transform the critical landscape with fresh perspectives
pay everyone fairly

Over the past two years, we've cultivated a pipeline of diverse writers, a dedicated editorial team, and an engaged community of fans. We have a healthy Patreon, through which we've earned a reputation for being ethical, transparent, and financially responsible. 
By any measure, we've been successful in our goals. 
So successful, in fact, that we're bursting at the seams. 

Problem
Patreon income covers all our running costs... from 8 months ago.
Our traffic has increased, which means our hosting costs have too.
Our private community has grown, so we need to pay community managers to moderate it. 
Our pipeline is so full we sometimes have to freeze pitches, even though we only publish 5 pieces a week right now. 
Just to keep pace with our own organic growth, we need more money. 
To fulfil our ambitions of becoming a hub for feminist fans of anime and manga and hiring employees (and treating them well), we need a lot more money. 

Solution
Our next step should be to actively market our work and develop new content... but we can't justify doing either until we fix two fundamental flaws in our infrastructure:
1. Our website is hard to use, not accessible, and isn't able to support our ambitions2. Our podcast, Chatty AF, has no transcripts
These two flaws are our only obstacles to growth. Big statement, but it's indefensible to spend money on marketing an unsuitable website, or on developing new content when our existing content is inaccessible.
So we need to fix both, as soon as possible - which requires a five-figure lump sum of cash. 

Opportunity
To raise enough money through Patreon to overhaul our website and transcribe over 90 hours of audio would take months, maybe years.
Through this crowdfunding campaign, we'll be able to fund both in a matter of days. 
With those two flaws fixed, we'll finally be able to enhance what we offer, experiment with new content, and explore bolder possibilities entirely. 
We just have to meet our goal first. 



 
Goal
Our goal is $19,900. We recently broke this number down in detail, but to summarize: 
Milestone 1: At $6,410 we'll be able to cover all external campaign running costs - CLEARED!Milestone 2: At $12,660 we can fund our website overhaul - CLEARED!Milestone 3: At $17,910 we can pay for transcriptions for all Chatty AF episodes to date - CLEARED!
GOAL: At $19,900, we'll be able to cover all internal campaign running costs as well - CLEARED!
Every stage of meeting our goal involves paying members of our community a fair rate for their work. When you help us reach 100%, you'll be supporting a culture of fair pay for creative work in geek spaces. 

Incentives
As a thank you to our community for supporting us in this campaign, we're offering something you've been requesting for a long time: AniFem's first ever merchandise!
We're creating a limited edition range of carefully selected items, each featuring a distinct design from original illustrations we've commissioned just for this campaign. This range is exclusive to backers of this campaign, and will not be available anywhere else. 
After the campaign ends, AniFem merchandise of any kind will be unavailable until we have the funds to open an online shop, commission new designs, and set up a solid infrastructure for production, shipping, and customer service.
Depending on how successful this campaign is, this could take some time... so make sure to get hold of any items you want while you can! 

Stretch Goals
Our community has a track record of stepping up when we ask, so we fully expect to meet this goal. As a thank you, we've then crafted and costed stretch goals to meet our top 3 most popular community requests...
CLEARED! Stretch Goal 1: at $20,500 we can create a recommendations page each for:

general feminist-friendly series
positive LGBTQ+ representation
series that are good for children or teenagers

CLEARED! Stretch Goal 2: at $22,500 we can build a straightforward review database featuring:

a centralized, ordered list of every review we write
a basic system enabling you to tell at a glance if we recommend a series or not
links to full episode reviews so you can click through for more detail

Stretch Goal 3: at $25,000 we can pay to:

integrate an online shop into our website
brand it in line with the rest of our online presence 
design our first range of merchandise to sell through the shop

UPDATE: Stretch Goal 4 is $30,000 - see Further Goals below for details of what it will fund.

Further Goals
Beyond $25,000 things get even more interesting. Our plans here involve funding:


experiments to work out whether - and how - to offer our community new streams of content e.g. the production of a single video essay so we understand the budget required to produce such videos on a regular basis and can raise funds accordingly


behind-the-scenes projects to help us run more efficientlye.g. a social media audit and overhaul to make our online presence pro-active, consistent, and data-driven


research into bigger ideas to understand how best to develop them e.g. attending two representative events in order to understand how best to make events part of our growth strategy


If it looks like we're heading towards $25,000, we'll cost and prioritize as many more goals as we need to ensure that you always know where your money will go next. 
UPDATE: Our final stretch goal, Stretch Goal 4, will be $30,000, bringing us $5,000 to fund all of the above in early 2019. 



 
Risks
Any project comes with risks, and we've done our best to identify and mitigate them right from the planning stages.
Under-funding
The biggest risk is of course that we don't meet our goal, which has more negative consequences for AniFem than may be obvious at first. 
However, choosing flexible funding, breaking down our goal into milestones, and prioritizing our campaign running costs means that backers can be confident of receiving the perks they've paid for - unless we fall short of our first milestone of $6,410. 
It is of course possible that we could fall that badly short. Our target market includes many marginalized fans, who are more likely in general to have less spare cash. That part of our base could well be unable to support us at this time of year, no matter how thorough or compelling our case, to the point that we fail to break even our first milestone. 
However, we can say with confidence that it's highly unlikely. 
For starters, our community has a track record here. When we ran a fundraising drive for a four-figure sum exactly this time last year, we met our goal within three days. Some even asked how they could contribute more than the $20 limit. 
We've marketed as smartly as possible so that our community feels comfortable and prepared to support us, including publishing a series of pre-launch editorials explaining:

why we're crowdfunding
what happens if we don't meet our goal
who gets the money we raise
how much we're aiming to raise

This marketing motivated almost 200 members of our community to register their intentions to contribute on our pre-launch page. Based on these numbers and our community's typical response to our fundraising activities, our chances of falling short of $6,410 are very low. 
(UPDATE: We met our first milestone in just 5 hours, and reached 100% of our goal the following day.)
Delayed perks 
After under-funding, the biggest risk is that we take longer than expected to send you your perks. We're still in the development process for the merchandise designs, and there is always a chance that incomplete work can go awry.
It's for this reason that we chosen to work with low-risk partners: an illustrator who is a member of the AniFem community, and merchandise and shipping suppliers who came recommended by personal contacts. It's highly unlikely that any of these established professionals will let us down. 
In addition, we've consistently made our financial estimates conservative, which gives us some buffer. If something were to go wrong in a way that had cost implications, we have enough leeway built into our calculations that we should be able to absorb any reasonable unexpected costs.

<p>As was said in our overview, San Diego is a hot spot for new and talented artist of every influence.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently, we have multiple artists and a couple of other compelling guests interested in sitting down with us, two venues willing to advertise us and let us use their headliner artist, art work, a website..

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to help your favorite artists grow, and to help you get to know them better. Once the podcast hits the internet, you'll be able to get involved in their work, communicate with them directly, and offer insight on what you want to see next both from the artist, and from us!<br/><br/>If you've made it this far, I also want to make it known that we won't only be focusing on music. We plan on having local businesses, local celebrities, and anyone of interest that we can get on board! You could also help out with that. Anyone you want to see on, just let us know, and we can try to work with them to bring the audience something new and exciting. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Essentially what we're doing here is starting a new business, and that can be complicated. A lot of the footwork has already been done by our team, but of course, we can't see the future. It's an expensive venture to get the broadcast up and running, but we've been working tirelessly to bring San Diego something we think could make a big difference. <br/><br/>Right now we're just working towards getting the funding to acquire the tools we need, and a proper space to hold interviews. Of course we could just run this out of a garage, and if that's what needs to be done, we will make it happen. But, some guests will be more enticed by air conditioning and comfy chairs, so an upgrade wouldn't hurt.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that giving your money to a project that hasn't supplied any content isn't easy, but if you like what we're doing, there's other ways you could bring us online!<br/><br/>Feel free to like our Facebook page @: fb.me/localsonlybroadcast<br/>Follow our twitter at: @localsonlycast<br/>Share what we're doing with your friends, and try to get them involved!<br/>One of the biggest things we could use is sponsorship. In terms of sponsorship, we want to keep it localized. We want to advertise our fellow San Diegans, and get their businesses out there. Have a friend who's starting a clothing line? Send them our way! Does your neighbor own a bar downtown? We want to talk to them.<br/><br/><strong>_________________________________________________________________________________</strong><br/><br/>Thank you for giving us a shot, and we are beyond excited to bring you new listening experiences!<br/><br/>~Locals Only Broadcast</p>

Once the podcast hits the internet, you'll be able to get involved in their work, communicate with them directly, and offer insight on what you want to see next both from the artist, and from us!If you've made it this far, I also want to make it known that we won't only be focusing on music. We plan on having local businesses, local celebrities, and anyone of interest that we can get on board! You could also help out with that. Anyone you want to see on, just let us know, and we can try to work with them to bring the audience something new and exciting. 

Risks & Challenges
Essentially what we're doing here is starting a new business, and that can be complicated. A lot of the footwork has already been done by our team, but of course, we can't see the future. It's an expensive venture to get the broadcast up and running, but we've been working tirelessly to bring San Diego something we think could make a big difference. Right now we're just working towards getting the funding to acquire the tools we need, and a proper space to hold interviews. Of course we could just run this out of a garage, and if that's what needs to be done, we will make it happen. But, some guests will be more enticed by air conditioning and comfy chairs, so an upgrade wouldn't hurt.

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that giving your money to a project that hasn't supplied any content isn't easy, but if you like what we're doing, there's other ways you could bring us online!Feel free to like our Facebook page @: fb.me/localsonlybroadcastFollow our twitter at: @localsonlycastShare what we're doing with your friends, and try to get them involved!One of the biggest things we could use is sponsorship. In terms of sponsorship, we want to keep it localized. We want to advertise our fellow San Diegans, and get their businesses out there. Have a friend who's starting a clothing line? Send them our way! Does your neighbor own a bar downtown? We want to talk to them._________________________________________________________________________________Thank you for giving us a shot, and we are beyond excited to bring you new listening experiences!~Locals Only Broadcast",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Since then we have grown into a robust community of discerning listeners (music nerds) who love to exchange opinions on all genres of music and chew over the day's headlines. Over the years we have published thousands of longform interviews (with everyone from Drake to Diamanda Galás) and reviews, hosted concerts in cities around the world, and witnessed many of the word-of-mouth successes we championed first — acts like Vampire Weekend, Arcade Fire, and Billie Eilish — become icons. Earlier this year, we acquired Stereogum from our former parent company and became a fully independent publication with no corporate investment. We did so with a solid plan to diversify Stereogum’s business, which currently derives all of its revenue from advertising at a time when 70% of all digital ad spending goes to Google, Facebook, and Amazon. We knew building a sustainable operation would not be easy. But since March, like so many other publications big and small, we have seen our advertising revenue plummet more than 50% because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerts and festivals, historically our biggest advertisers, have disappeared entirely.We risk shutting down before we even got a chance to get going as an independent entity. We have a plan to modernize and just need to survive this tough time in order to execute it.Scott LapatineFounder/Editor-in-Chief THE ALBUMAn exclusive release we made just for this campaign...Save Stereogum: An ‘00s Covers Comp is an exclusive new compilation we produced just for this Indiegogo campaign. We asked over 50 of our favorite artists to record brand new, never-before-heard covers of songs from 2000-2009. (Aughts nostalgia ... it’s time!) Donors will receive a .zip download of the compilation — including MP3s, WAVs, and liner notes — and will be the envy of their friends because it will never be released again! We won’t be streaming Save Stereogum anywhere and will never reissue it. It’s only available to supporters of this campaign.We’re not revealing in advance what songs they covered (it’ll be a surprise) but here, in alphabetical order, is who’s on the album…

 WHAT WE NEEDSupport your favorite independent music blog...Your donations will allow us to:
Keep our small staff employed and assignments flowing to our network of freelancers. If this campaign does really well, we can even hire more full-time writers.
Pay our hosting, SaaS, and site maintenance costs. 
Complete an amazing redesign/relaunch of the website we have been working on for several months — we’re about 70% there! The new Stereogum will look more modern, be easier to navigate and search, and feature a more advanced commenting platform with all the functionality you’ve been asking for over the years.
Reduce the number of banner ads and remove the obtrusive units we reluctantly implemented because we really need the money right now.
Secure the archives of videogum.com, our defunct sister site about movies, TV, and trampoline accidents.
Continue our popular series The Number Ones, in which we are reviewing every #1 single ever in chronological order. We don’t wanna quit in the ‘80s!
 WHAT YOU GETPerks for donating...We have some great rewards for supporters of our crowdfunding campaign. Each donation level below comes with the album… ‣ GENERAL ADMISSION (JUST THE ALBUM)Our GA tier gets you a download of the album with liner notes. Here's the artwork:‣ FRONT ROW (T-SHIRTS)Our original t-shirts (modeled below by Phoenix and Sufjan Stevens) are all gone so we've produced the first new Stereogum tees in over 10 years.Our 2020 shirts are available in 5 snazzy styles, are 100% cotton, and come in sizes S-XXL. All of the artists who appear on the 'Save Stereogum' comp will be getting a t-shirt so you can own the same t-shirt as those very talented and generous musicians!Here are the styles (photos below): black with gold vintage-y design, military green with grey vintage-y design, sports grey with multicolor wings design, royal blue with white fridge design, and black with white metal design. ‣ VIP (ZOOM ALBUM LAUNCH PARTY/MINI-FESTIVAL)This October 23rd (note: pushed back from September) our staff will celebrate the release of the comp at New York’s hottest club, Zoom. You'll be on the virtual guest list. Stereogum writers will emcee, infamous commenters will be challenged to reveal themselves, and we'll watch dozens of exclusive new performances from our favorite artists!The event will be broadcast one time on fans.com (which integrates with the Zoom app) and here are some of the artists you can expect along with dozens more we can't announce quite yet... ‣ BACKSTAGE (LIMITED EDITION MERCH BUNDLE)We've put together a package (bundles... everyone's doing it!) of Stereogum merch available while supplies last. Along with one of our new t-shirts of your choice you'll get:
A pair of Stereogum sunglasses in black, white, hot pink, translucent, or translucent lime! We will choose the color for you. Grian from Fontaines D.C. models a pink pair in the photo below.
A pack of the Stereogum chewing gum produced for our 2019 SXSW parties! Is it still edible? Probably. Drew from Public Practice holds a pack in the photo below.
Three different high-quality posters from past Stereogum concerts! These delightful time capsules were printed in very limited quantities for our SXSW shows in Austin (2016 and 2017) and our Christmas shows in Brooklyn (2016, 2017, and 2018). Each features a different lineup, and measures 11”x17”. We will choose three for you.
Three different Stereogum stickers! Suitable for sticking on your laptop or omnichord.
Three Stereogum matchbooks! Keep out of reach of children.
  ‣ ALL ACCESS (A CUSTOM ‘THE NUMBER ONES’)Stereogum's The Number Ones series has been reviewing, in order, every #1 single since the start of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1958. (We’re currently up to the mid-‘80s.) For donors at our highest tier Stereogum.com will publish a Tom Breihan-penned, 'The Number Ones'-format review of any song. OK, well, it has to have been a Hot 100 hit, so Tom can do it properly. Choose your favorite song! Or least favorite! Or ""Pac-Man Fever""! We'll contact you for your pick and credit you in the article when it runs. UPDATE (7/13)Our ""Backstage"" merch bundles sold out immediately, so by popular demand we’ve added some new perks for donors in the final month of the campaign.‣ VVIP (HOODIE/PINS/STICKERS MERCH BUNDLE)This new bundle includes:
A midweight, zippered Independent Trading Co. hooded sweatshirt in heather gunmetal grey featuring another thrilling new design of our name. It's a 8.5 oz poly/cotton blend.
A set of 3 high-quality hard enamel pins. Each is 1.25"" wide.
A set of 6 different stickers.
And you also get the Zoom virtual launch party from the VIP tier along with the Save Stereogum album download.
‣ PIT (A NEW SHIRT DESIGN)This bonus shirt features a vintage-style variation of our new design (seen on the hoodie) and the shirt comes in 3 colors (heather navy, maroon, black) and 6 sizes (S-3XL).Note: this shirt DOES NOT come with the album. You can order the Save Stereogum comp separately if you'd like. Unfortunately due to limitations with the platform, we cannot combine shipping with a previously placed order. FULFILLMENT TIMELINEMixing is now being completed for the Save Stereogum tracks, and they'll be mastered and ready to send out in early September. We will ship all physical rewards in September too. (For all rewards shipped outside the US, taxes and duties are to be paid by the receiver upon delivery.

<p><strong>$2,750 / Food &amp; Lodging:  </strong>When creating a five-month budget for this project I quickly realized that food and lodging will be my biggest expense. While Poland and Germany are relatively affordable, it's Denmark and Norway that have the highest cost of living. Those locations comprise half of the interviews needed to tell the story and are critical in making the entire project come together.</p>
<p><strong>$1,250 / Equipment:  </strong>Additional funds will allow me to upgrade my recording equipment to get professional sound quality, but also increase my security risks. That means protective measures like insurance, extra storage devices, cloud backup, and security locks will be a must. Putting all that work in would be for nothing if the recorded data were to be lost because of theft, device failure, or border security interference.</p>
<p><strong>$1,050 / Air, Train, and Ferry Tickets:  </strong>To reach most of the locations on our route, and to recreate the original experience of getting there, I will be traveling by train and ferry whenever possible. The long train routes, sometimes taking days, were difficult when I was a child. Now I will board the trains again and use the time in transit in service of the project.</p>

<p><strong>Map from the journey:</strong>  Some of the higher reward levels also include a paper map from the route. Yes, an actual paper map with lines drawn on it.

<p><strong>Limited edition prints:</strong>  Available at multiple reward levels, these signed and numbered prints are limited to editions of 50 each. Inspired by communist era posters from Poland, both are from an ongoing body of work where I look for corporate messaging, sometimes from internal company documents, and put said phrases into an alternative context. When we take a step back and look harder at these power structures it's not so clear where the difference between propaganda and advertising lies.</p>

<p><strong>Polish dinner party:</strong> Towards the end of the year mom and I will host a Polish dinner party for a small group of contributors.

<p><strong>Original paintings:</strong> Only two original paintings are available for upper level rewards. These compositions are from my Eastern Block series and are painted in acrylic on canvas paper, measuring 18 by 24 inches.

Postcards from the journey: Several reward levels will receive one or more postcards from stops along the journey. It's this thing people did in days of yore, but I hear the trend is coming back.

Letters from the journey:  A limited number of contributors will receive a handwritten letter from a mystery spot along the route. Each letter will be from a different location and will include a piece of ephemera such as a ticket stub, brochure, or some other mysterious object. You will probably have forgotten all about it when, one day, something that's not another credit card offer will show up in your mailbox. Try not to throw it away with the rest of your junk mail.
 

Map from the journey:  Some of the higher reward levels also include a paper map from the route. Yes, an actual paper map with lines drawn on it. It doesn't have street view or traffic predictions and it won't help you find the best coffee shops. But it does have unlimited battery life and works regardless of reception.

Limited edition prints:  Available at multiple reward levels, these signed and numbered prints are limited to editions of 50 each. Inspired by communist era posters from Poland, both are from an ongoing body of work where I look for corporate messaging, sometimes from internal company documents, and put said phrases into an alternative context. When we take a step back and look harder at these power structures it's not so clear where the difference between propaganda and advertising lies.

Photo book from the journey: Remember all those photo albums we used to collect? This book will be just like that, but different. After the journey concludes, I will create a limited edition hardcover photo book. And by create I mean I will physically make these books myself. I'll spare you going through thousands of photos and will pick only the most interesting shots.
 

Polish dinner party: Towards the end of the year mom and I will host a Polish dinner party for a small group of contributors. There will definitely be pierogi, probably some sausage, borsht, and bigos. You will have a deliciously good time and have the opportunity to meet the legend herself. Personally, I can hardly wait for this!
 

Original paintings: Only two original paintings are available for upper level rewards. These compositions are from my Eastern Block series and are painted in acrylic on canvas paper, measuring 18 by 24 inches. I grew up in a building much like one of these, where the dust and soot would streak down the exterior when it rained. Those buildings still loom large above my memories of that time.
 

Podcast advertisement: Upper level rewards feature advertising spots on the podcast when it goes live in 2018. This could be for your business or yourself as an independent professional. The best part is that I will personally sit down with you to create a narrative ad that is unique and represents your brand in a compelling way.

<h3>Overview: Reporting that seeks to empower</h3>
<p><strong>The ENERGY ACTION Project</strong> <strong>(EnAct)</strong> is a multimedia project that addresses two social issues: it aims to raise awareness of high levels of energy poverty and directly tackle the challenge of low energy literacy.<br/>The scope of these challenges is huge: at present, almost half the world’s population lacks the energy they need to sustain basic well-being and fully participate in social and economic development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2.7 billion people have no access to modern energy (Africa and Asia)</strong></li>
<li><strong>100 million cannot afford today’s energy prices (Europe and North America)</strong></li>
<li><strong>One energy literacy test found only 12% of people could correctly answer 50% of basic questions. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With ~20,000 followers</strong> across social media channels, EnAct has strong public reach. In parallel, we've built strong relations with energy experts, academics, policy makers, civil society organisations and social innovators. Through engaging content, we've empowered diverse people to make important decisions about how to support <strong>Sustainable Development Goal #7 -- ensuring universal access to affordable, sustainable energy. </strong></p>
<p>For an overview of the project, visit our <strong><a href=""http://www.en-act.org/the-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.</strong></p>
<p>For a fully developed thematic package, visit <a href=""http://www.coldathome.today"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>COLD@HOME </strong></a></p>
<p>To see our plans for a new package on the clean cooking challenge, see: <u><strong><a href=""http://www.aburningconcern.today"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A BURNING CONCERN</a></strong></u></p>
<h3>This campaign: Energy journalism internships</h3>
<p><strong>With COVID-19 putting business ‘on hold’, many students are left with little chance to gain work experience through summer jobs.</strong> Interns – often working remotely – have played key roles in EnAct’s development. In turn, the knowledge and skills they gain attract the attention of recruiters for long-term positions. </p>
<p>We’re keen to bring new people on board over the summer of 2020, and on an ongoing basis. <strong>For each $4000 raised, we will offer a three-month internship </strong>to a dedicated and exceptional student. We hope this campaign will enable us to offer internships to students in multiple countries, thereby giving them the opportunity to work with local experts and our international team.</p>
<p>Interns are given opportunities to write content for diverse media, collaborate with visual storytellers, develop ideas for events and fundraising, and share in the administrative responsibilities of running a non-profit media outlet. They emerge with much deeper knowledge of the energy sector, enhanced research and interviewing skills, and a portfolio of published articles/blogs. In short, they are well-prepared to move into roles that involve communication about energy.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can engage</h3>
<p>EnAct's forte is creating compelling stories and making complex topics accessible to non-experts. Our journalistic team works closely actors in the energy access field to explore how creative arts – photo/video production, interactive and graphic design, writing/editing, etc. -- can boost understanding and engagement. </p>
<p>We’ve become energy news junkies, following stories from around the world about supply and demand, the impacts of energy poverty, technology advances, energy policies, financing challenges, social challenges – the list goes on.</p>
<p>EnAct welcomes other forms of engagement that support our mission, including:  </p>
<p><strong>Write a blog: </strong>Tell us how you are engaged in achieving SDG7; we'll post and promote it through social media channels (and give you editing advice along the way!).<strong> </strong></p>
<p><b>Become an EnAct member: </b>EnAct members get access to exclusive webinars that cover both energy and communications. Their profiles are featured on relevant EnAct websites to promote interaction and provide an expert database for other journalists, They also have a say, through annual general meetings, in shaping the future of EnAct.    </p>
<p><strong>Be an EnAct Ambassador: </strong>Typically EnAct members, our Ambassadors take their commitment up a notch by agreeing to promote EnAct in their professional activities and personal networks. We ask Ambassadors to (as appropriate) highlight EnAct when presenting at conferences, host local events (such a film screenings or photo exhibits) and identify sources of funding to help us report on energy poverty in their own areas. </p>

In parallel, we've built strong relations with energy experts, academics, policy makers, civil society organisations and social innovators. Through engaging content, we've empowered diverse people to make important decisions about how to support Sustainable Development Goal #7 -- ensuring universal access to affordable, sustainable energy.

This campaign: Energy journalism internships
With COVID-19 putting business ‘on hold’, many students are left with little chance to gain work experience through summer jobs. Interns – often working remotely – have played key roles in EnAct’s development. In turn, the knowledge and skills they gain attract the attention of recruiters for long-term positions. 
We’re keen to bring new people on board over the summer of 2020, and on an ongoing basis. For each $4000 raised, we will offer a three-month internship to a dedicated and exceptional student. We hope this campaign will enable us to offer internships to students in multiple countries, thereby giving them the opportunity to work with local experts and our international team.
Interns are given opportunities to write content for diverse media, collaborate with visual storytellers, develop ideas for events and fundraising, and share in the administrative responsibilities of running a non-profit media outlet. They emerge with much deeper knowledge of the energy sector, enhanced research and interviewing skills, and a portfolio of published articles/blogs. In short, they are well-prepared to move into roles that involve communication about energy.  

Other ways you can engage
EnAct's forte is creating compelling stories and making complex topics accessible to non-experts. Our journalistic team works closely actors in the energy access field to explore how creative arts – photo/video production, interactive and graphic design, writing/editing, etc. -- can boost understanding and engagement. 
We’ve become energy news junkies, following stories from around the world about supply and demand, the impacts of energy poverty, technology advances, energy policies, financing challenges, social challenges – the list goes on.
EnAct welcomes other forms of engagement that support our mission, including:  
Write a blog: Tell us how you are engaged in achieving SDG7; we'll post and promote it through social media channels (and give you editing advice along the way!). 
Become an EnAct member: EnAct members get access to exclusive webinars that cover both energy and communications. Their profiles are featured on relevant EnAct websites to promote interaction and provide an expert database for other journalists, They also have a say, through annual general meetings, in shaping the future of EnAct.    
Be an EnAct Ambassador: Typically EnAct members, our Ambassadors take their commitment up a notch by agreeing to promote EnAct in their professional activities and personal networks. We ask Ambassadors to (as appropriate) highlight EnAct when presenting at conferences, host local events (such a film screenings or photo exhibits) and identify sources of funding to help us report on energy poverty in their own areas.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h2><strong><u>UPDATE:</u> WE REACHED OUR INITIAL GOAL IN JUST FIVE DAYS! YOU ALL ARE INCREDIBLE. NOW, WE'RE SHOOTING FOR A STRETCH GOAL OF $9,000!</strong></h2>
<p>The quick success of this campaign has excited, inspired, and humbled me so deeply. I honestly had no idea if Hungry's message would resonate with anyone enough for them to support its growth. I am very happy to say that I was <i>very </i>wrong.</p>
<p>We reached our goal in just five days. Five days?!? This already allows me to pay the tuition for this residency that will help to expand the show. Now, we are shooting for a stretch goal of $9,000 to pay for the housing and food costs of the residency. Every single dollar after $9,000 goes towards equipment upgrades for the show; a new computer to update from the little Surface 3 the show is made on, and a new top-notch microphone that will give justice to the stories shared on the show.</p>
<p>Your generosity has caught the attention of an incredible illustrator friend of mine, who has offered to make an exclusive, brand-new Hungry shirt design (coming soon)! The more we raise, the crazier perks I can bring to you. So help us blow this thing out of the water so we can produce a high-quality show full-time. Thank you all. </p>

<h3>I'm Otis Gray, and I'm a storyteller.</h3>
<p>I started the Hungry podcast three years ago. It's an audio show about food, the stories behind it, the people who make it, and the power of what we eat in a polarized world. The podcast was founded on the idea that the only way to successfully navigate through a batsh*t world is through sharing authentic, captivating, honest stories.</p>
<p>The show has always been a platform to share real human stories that shed light on ideas and issues that affect us all. From the legendary barbacoa chef Cristina Martinez dealing with complex immigration policy, to the intrepid folks of West Virginia responding to food shortages in inspiringly creative ways. The show takes you to the Muslim-owned ""Trump Cafe"" in rural Texas, and then to the front lines of WWI- where donuts were responsible for the first women on the front lines in U.S. history. Since its inception, Hungry has been a crusade to understand an insane, divisive world, all through the lens of food.</p>
<h3>The Big Break!</h3>
<p>I was recently accepted to attend Transom, a broadcasting and journalism residency program by Atlantic Public Media. It's a career launching residency where some of the best audio producers in the world, including Ira Glass of This American Life, come to train junior producers to be successful radio storytellers. Alumni from this residency have gone on to become game-changing producers on shows like RadioLab and Nancy among others.</p>
<p>With your support, I'll be able to attend and share stories with a world that needs them, and be given the life changing opportunity to pursue the Hungry podcast full-time. The money you give will cover tuition, housing, food, and travel costs of residency.</p>
<p>Since dedicating my life to finding and sharing stories, I've become an award-winning storyteller and MothSlam Champ; the show has over 50 five-star ratings on iTunes; and I recently produced a story that was broadcasted on national radio. All of this while serving tables and doing odd jobs to support though show. </p>
<p>In a world that requires honest, true stories more than ever- it's time for me to take that next big step to producing audio stories full-time. This residency is the final push to make that a reality- and it can only happen with your support.</p>
<p>This workshop would undoubtedly change my life and career. But really, your money goes directly toward building the Hungry platform. In doing that, you are single-handedly making it possible for incredibly important stories to be heard. Stories that make you laugh, shudder, dance, cry, stories that fire you up and inspire you, stories that might even restore your faith in humanity! These are all stories from people at the heart of our national conversations. In helping to shed light on those stories, you are taking part in very real change on a grass-roots level, helping real people achieve their goals. </p>
<p>I started this show because the stories I heard around food were the most brutally honest, vulnerable, tough conversations that I'd been part of. Stories that rocked my worldview and stripped me of the many biases I unknowingly had and am still upending. In 2018, these stories are the best weapon we have in the fight for truth and understanding.</p>
<p>Be a part in that fight, and help to tell a story.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>I'm asking for your support in covering the tuition of the residency, which is $6,500. The total cost of the residency is $9,500. To break it down:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515428409/ebac62lkmfriy9q3auxv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>$6,950 for tuition</li>
<li>$2,300 for housing costs</li>
<li>$285 for food </li>
<li>$100 travel costs </li>
</ul>
<p>You would be helping to cover that huge portion of tuition by donating. That being said- I would love to blow that goal <i>out of the water</i>. If we reach our goal, I'll extend the goal to $8,500 to pay for the housing fees of residency. If we reach that, we'll do another stretch goal to $9,500 to cover food and travel costs. This would <i>entirely</i> pay the workshop. Each benchmark we reach, the crazier new perks I'll be able to roll out in return for your generosity. </p>
<p>If we reach over $9,500, this is where things get <strong>VERY</strong> cool. This will allow me to update the equipment used to make the show (I still produce the whole show off a little old Microsoft Surface 3 tablet!). Essentially, every dollar donated over $9,500 directly contributes to a higher quality show. You would single-handedly be a part in making each episode possible. From there on- the possibilities are really endless. From bringing on production help to having money for advertising the show, there are a million things I can do with any extra money to make the show even better for you.</p>
<p>There are some killer rewards for donating, especially if you donate in the first week to get our Early Backer Specials!</p>

<p>Exclusive content, never-before-heard bonus episodes and behind the scenes audio, Hungry tote bags, shirts, hoodies, personalized recordings, advertisements on the show, even limited-edition cooking aprons. I designed this logo myself and screen-printed everything by hand in the Brooklyn studio I work in. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/>  </p>

<p>If we reach the goal quickly- I'll be able to do even cooler stuff like make new designs or even bring on incredible illustrators to design custom one-time only Hungry shirts!</p> <p>Here's some more awesome stuff you can get in return for your insanely-appreciated support.</p>

<p>If you listen to the Hungry podcast, you may have heard that donuts were the reason for the first women on the front lines in U.S. history. Crazy right?! Well, we found an authentic WWII-era recipe concocted by the ""Donut Lassies"" themselves. Now, I want to pass it along to you in the form of an awesome little recipe card that includes exclusive access to a how-to video online where I do my best to channel the bravery of the lassies into fresh, hot donuts. If we reach our goal quick, I'll be able to bring more great perks like this to you as we go for the stretch goal.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515464848/f5s4hccvb9ndat3e1yja.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515464861/qebd7qrbccjha5nej55f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There are great perks at every level, whether you can afford to throw in the price of a couple cups of coffee ($5) or would be gracious enough to donate $100 - which buys you a personalized recording of your choice! Put this sultry radio voice to work: I'll record your voicemail, an audio love letter to someone, one of your favorite stories, an epic ""I QUIT"" message for your boss, anything you want. Be creative.</p>

<p>A 45-second advertisement on the Hungry podcast for a cause or product of your choosing. This usually costs way more- but it's one way I can express my extreme gratitude for your support. My platform is your platform. </p>

Tell your story on the Hungry podcast. Or, join in and I'll tell <i>you </i> a story live on the show. Be emblazoned in Hungry history. You deserve it.</p>
<p>Even crazier perks if you donate more, but they are limited so grab them quick. I assure you, they are worth it. Can't tell you how much I appreciate the support, from $1 donors to $2000 donors. You're allowing me to do what I love and in turn helping incredible people get their stories told. </p>
<p>Let's reach our goal quick so I can roll out even more perks for you.</p>

<h2>What your support really means.</h2>
<p>Let's be real. The time we live in is absolutely insane. It's harder than ever to know what the truth is. It's easier than ever to jump to conclusions and judge people we don't know from places we've never been to. The divide of information and the values we have has never been greater- and there are many people profiting off of the trash-fire that is our national dialogue. </p>
<p>However. There are many people who are fighting every day to revolutionize the media and bring honest, sincere, hard-pill-to-swallow stories to the forefront and restore a sense of authenticity that every. person. in. America. craves.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Hungry podcast is a platform for precisely that. It is meant to be an honest conversation with good food, bad wine, and exemplary people. Whether it's a tough, civil </span>exchange<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> with someone on the other side of the aisle, or a </span>raucous<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and radical food fight in celebration of progress- the stories on the show are intended to cut through the nonsense and the untruths to deliver dialogue that will move us all forward.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Your support builds that platform. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I've already given every spare hour I have to making this show possible, and now I want to give even more. This residency could allow me to stop doing those other jobs to support the show, and truly dedicate all I've got to fighting the fires of 2018 onward with a ferocious search for authenticity and game-changers who might otherwise go unheard.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Not only that, but when these stories about real people with small businesses are exposed on the show, they see more traffic. When we aired our ""Five Loaves and Two Fishes"" story about a food bank in WV on the podcast and as an article in the national publication <a href=""http://narrative.ly/can-hydroponic-lettuce-save-coal-country/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Narratively</a>, the food bank </span>received<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> sizable donations from followers of Hungry. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">While Hungry is one small piece in the greater struggle for </span>authenticity<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and truth, your support helps real people achieve their goals on a grassroots level.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In asking you to support me in attending this residency, I'm asking you to join me in sharing the stories of brilliant people fighting for change, and making sure their voices resonate.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Making audio is not as easy as NPR shows and This American Life makes it sound. Some of the stories I've produced have taken months or coordinating, research, travel, and writing- even before any editing takes place. Being self-taught, I've made many mistakes and learned the hard way at every turn. Attending this residency and being taught by the best seasoned radio professionals will help to streamline my process, all while enhancing the quality of the stories I put forward.</p>
<p>That being said, I've always been a self-starter and I thrive when getting my hands dirty. I graduated from Rhode Island School of Design with a BFA in Sculpture. I co-founded and built a gourmet food truck when I was 19. I went on to become a bronze artist and welder in Philadelphia. After finding podcasts while working that job, I realized that this was the best medium to tell the stories I always wanted to share. </p>
<p>I bought a microphone and got to work. It was a rough start. I hated hearing my voice in the microphone and couldn't write for radio if I was at gunpoint. Today, I'm an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIUqqWccTCQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">award-winning storyteller</a> and MothSlam Champ; the show was awarded a grant to travel in Guatemala for an upcoming series; and I've produced stories that have been broadcasted on national radio including an in-process collaboration with the fantastic <a href=""https://www.southernfoodways.org/gravy-format/gravy-podcast/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gravy</a> podcast.</p>
<p>All this to say- I do not take your support lightly. Having fought upstream to make this show happen in the first place, I truly understand how far a dollar can take me, and never take support for granted. While this is what I love to do, I feel a deep sense of responsibility to others to actually do it. Part of the reason I started this show is because no one else was sharing the stories I thought were imperative to our national dialogue. In 2018, it is more clear than ever that these stories have a big role in moving our world forward.</p>

In a world that requires honest, true stories more than ever- it's time for me to take that next big step to producing audio stories full-time. This residency is the final push to make that a reality- and it can only happen with your support.
This workshop would undoubtedly change my life and career. But really, your money goes directly toward building the Hungry platform. In doing that, you are single-handedly making it possible for incredibly important stories to be heard. Stories that make you laugh, shudder, dance, cry, stories that fire you up and inspire you, stories that might even restore your faith in humanity! These are all stories from people at the heart of our national conversations. In helping to shed light on those stories, you are taking part in very real change on a grass-roots level, helping real people achieve their goals. 
I started this show because the stories I heard around food were the most brutally honest, vulnerable, tough conversations that I'd been part of. Stories that rocked my worldview and stripped me of the many biases I unknowingly had and am still upending. In 2018, these stories are the best weapon we have in the fight for truth and understanding.
Be a part in that fight, and help to tell a story.
What I Need & What You Get

I'm asking for your support in covering the tuition of the residency, which is $6,500. The total cost of the residency is $9,500. To break it down:


$6,950 for tuition
$2,300 for housing costs
$285 for food 
$100 travel costs 

You would be helping to cover that huge portion of tuition by donating. That being said- I would love to blow that goal out of the water. If we reach our goal, I'll extend the goal to $8,500 to pay for the housing fees of residency. If we reach that, we'll do another stretch goal to $9,500 to cover food and travel costs. This would entirely pay the workshop. Each benchmark we reach, the crazier new perks I'll be able to roll out in return for your generosity. 
If we reach over $9,500, this is where things get VERY cool. This will allow me to update the equipment used to make the show (I still produce the whole show off a little old Microsoft Surface 3 tablet!). Essentially, every dollar donated over $9,500 directly contributes to a higher quality show. You would single-handedly be a part in making each episode possible. From there on- the possibilities are really endless. From bringing on production help to having money for advertising the show, there are a million things I can do with any extra money to make the show even better for you.
There are some killer rewards for donating, especially if you donate in the first week to get our Early Backer Specials!

Exclusive content, never-before-heard bonus episodes and behind the scenes audio, Hungry tote bags, shirts, hoodies, personalized recordings, advertisements on the show, even limited-edition cooking aprons. I designed this logo myself and screen-printed everything by hand in the Brooklyn studio I work in.   

If we reach the goal quickly- I'll be able to do even cooler stuff like make new designs or even bring on incredible illustrators to design custom one-time only Hungry shirts! Here's some more awesome stuff you can get in return for your insanely-appreciated support.

If you listen to the Hungry podcast, you may have heard that donuts were the reason for the first women on the front lines in U.S. history. Crazy right?! Well, we found an authentic WWII-era recipe concocted by the ""Donut Lassies"" themselves. Now, I want to pass it along to you in the form of an awesome little recipe card that includes exclusive access to a how-to video online where I do my best to channel the bravery of the lassies into fresh, hot donuts. If we reach our goal quick, I'll be able to bring more great perks like this to you as we go for the stretch goal.
 
There are great perks at every level, whether you can afford to throw in the price of a couple cups of coffee ($5) or would be gracious enough to donate $100 - which buys you a personalized recording of your choice! Put this sultry radio voice to work: I'll record your voicemail, an audio love letter to someone, one of your favorite stories, an epic ""I QUIT"" message for your boss, anything you want. Be creative.

A 45-second advertisement on the Hungry podcast for a cause or product of your choosing. This usually costs way more- but it's one way I can express my extreme gratitude for your support. My platform is your platform. 
 

This is one of the comfier hoodies you'll wear, and Darren up here ^ rocks it. I wear mine almost every day if my girlfriend doesn't steal it. These are hand-printed by yours truly and made with pure love. Very limited amount. Get the hoodie & more swag pack in the first week for $25 off the normal price. 

 This is a big one. I want you on the show. Got a great story related to food to tell? Vivid memories of making grandma's badass mac and cheese in the kitchen with her? Tell your story on the Hungry podcast. Or, join in and I'll tell you  a story live on the show. Be emblazoned in Hungry history. You deserve it.
Even crazier perks if you donate more, but they are limited so grab them quick. I assure you, they are worth it. Can't tell you how much I appreciate the support, from $1 donors to $2000 donors. You're allowing me to do what I love and in turn helping incredible people get their stories told. 
Let's reach our goal quick so I can roll out even more perks for you.
 

What your support really means.
Let's be real. The time we live in is absolutely insane. It's harder than ever to know what the truth is. It's easier than ever to jump to conclusions and judge people we don't know from places we've never been to. The divide of information and the values we have has never been greater- and there are many people profiting off of the trash-fire that is our national dialogue. 
However. There are many people who are fighting every day to revolutionize the media and bring honest, sincere, hard-pill-to-swallow stories to the forefront and restore a sense of authenticity that every. person. in. America. craves.
The Hungry podcast is a platform for precisely that. It is meant to be an honest conversation with good food, bad wine, and exemplary people. Whether it's a tough, civil exchange with someone on the other side of the aisle, or a raucous and radical food fight in celebration of progress- the stories on the show are intended to cut through the nonsense and the untruths to deliver dialogue that will move us all forward.
Your support builds that platform. 
I've already given every spare hour I have to making this show possible, and now I want to give even more. This residency could allow me to stop doing those other jobs to support the show, and truly dedicate all I've got to fighting the fires of 2018 onward with a ferocious search for authenticity and game-changers who might otherwise go unheard.
Not only that, but when these stories about real people with small businesses are exposed on the show, they see more traffic. When we aired our ""Five Loaves and Two Fishes"" story about a food bank in WV on the podcast and as an article in the national publication Narratively, the food bank received sizable donations from followers of Hungry. 
While Hungry is one small piece in the greater struggle for authenticity and truth, your support helps real people achieve their goals on a grassroots level.
In asking you to support me in attending this residency, I'm asking you to join me in sharing the stories of brilliant people fighting for change, and making sure their voices resonate.
Risks & Challenges

Making audio is not as easy as NPR shows and This American Life makes it sound. Some of the stories I've produced have taken months or coordinating, research, travel, and writing- even before any editing takes place. Being self-taught, I've made many mistakes and learned the hard way at every turn. Attending this residency and being taught by the best seasoned radio professionals will help to streamline my process, all while enhancing the quality of the stories I put forward.
That being said, I've always been a self-starter and I thrive when getting my hands dirty. I graduated from Rhode Island School of Design with a BFA in Sculpture. I co-founded and built a gourmet food truck when I was 19. I went on to become a bronze artist and welder in Philadelphia. After finding podcasts while working that job, I realized that this was the best medium to tell the stories I always wanted to share. 
I bought a microphone and got to work. It was a rough start. I hated hearing my voice in the microphone and couldn't write for radio if I was at gunpoint. Today, I'm an award-winning storyteller and MothSlam Champ; the show was awarded a grant to travel in Guatemala for an upcoming series; and I've produced stories that have been broadcasted on national radio including an in-process collaboration with the fantastic Gravy podcast.
All this to say- I do not take your support lightly. Having fought upstream to make this show happen in the first place, I truly understand how far a dollar can take me, and never take support for granted. While this is what I love to do, I feel a deep sense of responsibility to others to actually do it. Part of the reason I started this show is because no one else was sharing the stories I thought were imperative to our national dialogue. In 2018, it is more clear than ever that these stories have a big role in moving our world forward.

<h3>Coldbeers and Curveballs</h3> <p>Howdy baseball fans,</p> <p>Chase Almy and Corey Stephens started this podcast 2 years ago with a minimal understanding of podcasting and a ""We'll do it live!"" mentality. In our first months, we had to work hard to improve our sound quality and to reach more than just 5 or 6 people. We slowly did that and honed our craft, creating a funny and off the cuff baseball show that would appeal to the beer drinking folks that love the game. Over time we've interviewed people like Jessica Kleinschmidt and Rangers broadcaster Eric Nadel, and have entertained thousands of people just like you.</p> <p>As we begin the third year of our podcast, we want to start it off with a bang and continue to rapidly expand our reach. We have thought up and planned a Spring Training 2019 Road Trip to Surprise, Arizona from Dallas, Texas, where we will stream audio and video of our crazy cross country trek. We'll be talking baseball news and cracking jokes for hours in the car, interviewing people and watching baseball games when we get to the Phoenix area, and pumping out content the whole time.</p> <p>But, an effort and undertaking like this will be costly, and in order for us to do it on a really high level, we need your help. Without your contributions, our Road Trip won't be the kind of success that we envision, and our efforts in the following months will be less effective.</p>
<p>We're asking for your support, and promise that in return you'll find it entertaining to ride along with us virtually and experience the atmosphere of Spring Training.</p> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our main expenses on this trip are for travel and lodging and some different microphones more suited for travel. We expect that those expenses will run us about $2400 in total. Obviously we'll need to create and buy some awesome T-shirts and hats as perks for our supporters, and there will be costs for the technology and software to create and promote the videos and share them with you and the rest of the world. We expect that those expenses, as well as the cost for marketing the campaign, will be around $900. The remaining money raised will all be put into making this trip even more awesome and into maintaining momentum and growth of our show in the coming months.</p> <p>In the event that we don't reach our goal, we feel that we will still be able to create a budget friendly experience that will still entertain our followers and supporters. Our reach might be diminished but we still feel that we can work hard and create good content going forward.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We feel like we've got some really valuable perks lined up for our supporters.</p> <p>At the more accessible end, we'll be shipping high quality die-cut stickers and / or custom baseball cards to our backers, as well as giving on air shout outs and thanks.</p> <p>At the medium tier, we'll be designing and shipping T-shirts, hats, and beer koozies for our supporters with custom logos commemorating  our road trip. Rest assured that these products will only be made of high quality materials and will look amazing.</p> <p>At the upper end of the perks offered, we will plan a trip to the ballpark with our biggest fans. For those who live in North Texas, we'll go out with you to events like Party at the Yard in Frisco (Party at the Yard is held during Thursday night home games of the Frisco Rough Riders) and have an amazing time. We'll be offering trips with us to Globe Life Park in Arlington, where we spend hours with you having a blast at the ballpark.</p> <p>If you want to have a fun filled evening with Chase and Corey, be sure to claim one of the limited perks at the upper end of our perk spectrum. If you do claim one of these high end perks, remember that you AND a friend can both join us at Party at the Yard in any of the 3 highest priced perks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the years, we've always been able to come up with solutions to the challenges we faced, whether it was opportunities that we had to improve our sound quality, learn and master new software, or create more effective ways to reach our fans. Because of this, we feel that no obstacle, whether it be in order fulfillment or logistics and planning, will be too great.</p> <p>We're very accessible on social media if you search for Coldbeers and Curveballs, and can answer any questions you might have at any time.</p> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For some, supporting our campaign financially is not feasible, and we understand that because we've had times of financial stress in our past as well.</p> <p>One of the best ways that you can help us though is by telling your friends about us and our campaign or by sharing our story to your social media networks.

<h2>STRETCH GOALS:</h2>
<p>We're super close to our goal, so I thought I should add our Stretch Goals right up top!</p>
<p><strong>If we reach $12,000</strong>: We'll invest in a <strong>Twitch streaming</strong> setup for the studio, so that we can start doing regular live gaming streams, reaching a wider audience and giving our current audience something fun to look forward to that's interactive and video-based! Regular JackBox streams? Exciting streams of new console games as they come out? Nostalgic romps into old classics? Yes please!</p>
<p><strong>If we reach $15,000</strong>: We'll be able to<strong> send 2 people from our team to PodCon</strong> in Seattle this January, who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to go! PodCon was really fantastic last year, and it's a great opportunity for networking and meeting fans. We'd love to be able to send a few people to PodCon this year, but we're on the East Coast, so we can't do that without breaking the bank, unless you help us reach this goal!</p>
<p><strong>If we reach $20,000</strong>: We'll be able to <strong>send 5 people to PodCon</strong>, and also have some room in our budget for <strong>marketing</strong> this year! That would be amazing! Please help make this happen!</p>
<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>The Upford Network is a new &amp; quickly-growing network of Podcasters &amp; Creators based primarily out of Montreal, Quebec. Our Executive Producer, Tom Zalatnai, and our Director of Programming, Julian McKenzie, launched the network earlier this year, with the goal of providing resources to creators to make high-quality, community-building shows.</p>
<p>We've always recorded out of our studio in Tom's house, where the sound quality is great, but the sound-proofing is not. The reality is, it costs a lot to properly soundproof a room, and since we're in a rental right now, we can't do the type of renovations we'd need to make the space a proper studio.</p>
<p>We're also excited to announce that Tom and his partner, our Chief Copywriter Teffer, are having a baby this Fall! Babies are exciting, but also noisy! So we've collaborated with a crack team of contractors who are going to help us out by building a soundproof recording booth big enough to fit five or six people comfortably, so that all the shows that record at our studio can continue to crank out high-quality programming week after week, without worrying about getting in the way of our little family (and vice versa!)</p>
<p>So, if you love babies and/or podcasts, and want to help us let both those things exist in the same space, consider donating to this campaign!</p>
<h2><strong>What's in it for YOU?</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>The contractor quoted us $10,000 for the job. This includes materials and labor. So that's our goal! We raise $10,000 and you can rest assured that the shows you love will not just continue to exist, but will thrive with an even greater level of audio quality than before!</p>
<p>We've also got a TON of really fantastic perks available! Since our network is made up of so many talented creators with all different skills and talents, we've got a wide array of rewards up for grabs! With low-cost perks like social media shoutouts and exclusive bonus content, and higher-cost ones like having us name our studio (or even our BABY) after you, there's also a bunch of sweet stuff up for grabs in the middle, like signed artwork, handmade stuffed animals, and even advertising opportunities (for those of you with your own projects to promote!)</p>
<p>You can check out the full list of perks on the side of this campaign page to find the one that's right for you :)</p>

<h3>Who cares about some podcast network in Montreal?</h3>
<p>Hey now, no need to get hostile! You'd actually be surprised at the number of people who've written in over the past three years and told us that one of our shows has made a big difference for them! We're a network that cares really deeply about building community between creators and their audiences, and I think that really makes a difference in people's lives. Having a show to come back to, week after week, where the hosts genuinely care about the people who are listening, helps a lot of people who feel lonely or out of place in the world to feel like somebody's there. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a really scary campaign for us. We have no idea how many of you will even read this far down the page (Hi! Thanks for reading this far down the page!) let alone how many of you will donate! But if we're going to keep making this content we're so passionate about, we really need your help. It's hard to ask people for money. It's such a vulnerable thing to admit that we can't do this alone, especially since there's so many of us. But we can't, because we're artists and creative-types and the economy is not nice to those!</p>
<p>The biggest challenge here is the time constraint. We can only run this campaign for 60 days, which is about 8 and a half weeks. That means we need to raise, on average, $1200/week. That's a lot of money! But with your help, we can make this thing a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What if I'm also broke and can't donate?</h3>
<p>Some people just can't afford to contribute financially, and that's totally okay!</p>
<p>There's other ways you can help us make this happen! This sort of campaign really only pays off if lots of people hear about it, so you can help us as easily as sharing this campaign on your social media feeds! If you'd really like to give us twenty bucks but can't afford to, maybe you've got a friend or two who can!</p>
<p>You can also support us by listening to &amp; sharing episodes of our shows throughout the months of June &amp; July to help raise awareness of our Network and of this campaign!</p>
<p>And, you can tune in every week for a Live Stream where various members of our team will be hanging out and doing fun stuff to try and generate extra donations for the campaign!</p>
<p>Every share and every dollar help get us one step closer to making our dream a reality!</p>
<p>Thanks so much for reading this!</p>

I graduated in December of 2019 with my Bachelor of Science in multiplatform journalism from Florida Institute of Technology.

<p>I have been a storyteller my whole life, and it is my dream to pursue this passion professionally. Additionally, it’s important to me to use my passion to help others. This is why I am launching The Spooky Sapphic Storyteller podcast. </p>
<p>This podcast will mix personal narrative with audio drama. I will voice the host, a 22-year-old journalist/amateur paranormal investigator, and will dive into topics exploring common experiences, challenges, and victories of LGBTQ people. My personal experiences will be woven into this podcast. Along the way, our main character will have some spooky guests on the podcast—specifically LGBTQ ghosts haunting her cabin.  Season one will be approximately 17 episodes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am working to create this podcast with what I already have—a basic microphone, editing software, and my own experiences, writing capabilities, and voice. However, I will need voice actors for certain episodes. The funds I raise will first and foremost go toward paying them for their work. Whatever funds I have remaining will go toward purchasing better recording equipment.</p>
<p>By donating, you’ll not only be helping me produce this podcast, but you’ll also receive perks. For $10, you’ll receive a handwritten thank-you card. For $50, you’ll be given access to a Zoom Q&amp;A/general discussion and hangout for all contributors of $50+, as well as a hand-written thank-you card. For $100, you’ll get the previous perks, as well as hand-drawn/painted character art and a thank-you at the end of every episode.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As I said at the beginning, I want to help others through this project. As I was beginning to understand my sexuality and accept myself, hearing the voices of other LGBTQ people was vital. I went from feeling completely alone to having a sense of being seen and understood. My goal is to provide that to others while also having some fun.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Why Are You Asking For Money?</h2>
<p>Arcane has thus far been completely self-funded by me, Jacob Quinn. But with my day job hours cut due to Covid and monetization not yet enough to be self-sufficient, I'm unable to fairly compensate my creative team and talented actors for the next 3 episodes. Your help would change that.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Only 3 Episodes? Is That The End?</h2>
<p>There will be more Arcane after episodes 7, 8, and 9. But by the time those three episodes are live. (Novemberish, with one episode coming out every two months.) I'll be in a better position financially to continue funding future episodes of Arcane.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Not Wait Until Then?</h2>
<p>I want to ensure Arcane continues for those who want to hear it. By asking for help now, I can keep the episodes coming without interruption!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What's In It For Me?</h2>
<p>In audio drama, they're many parts to creating a compelling whole: The skilled actors who bring the characters to life. The sound and music immersing and informing the show's world and the audio engineering that elevates the voices drawing you into the stories.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I started writing The Van in various formats-- novel, script, poem, short story-- four years ago when I was studying film and television. And although it has changed forms many times, I have changed majors, and the world has changed much in that time, it has always been meant to be a story about emotions and what we do with them and how they affect our relationships. Cola (our protagonist) has always been a character so overwhelmed with her own and others' emotions that she spends a lot of time wondering how to escape, if she can or should, and whether or not this makes her a good person. </p>
<p>In the time between when I started to write The Van and when it was produced, I struggled with a severe eating disorder and depression that caused me to take time off of school and seek treatment. During that time, I ended up trying to answer a lot of Cola's questions myself and realized what I was asking was can one survive and even thrive when their emotions seem to difficult to handle? It was a much tougher question to wrestle with than I initially understood. Now I've been in recovery for years and Cola's journey has expanded to include my experience and my newer questions.</p>
<p>This story is extremely personal and important to me. I've been lucky enough to have a team and a cast work with me for virtually no money up until this point, but because I owe them the debt of helping me tell this story, I want to make sure they are fairly compensated for the work they've done and for future work. That's what this campaign is for.</p>

<p>2. In a more exciting sense, prizes. We'll be offering perks like thank you notes from characters, poems from Cola, exclusive stickers, and road trip packages!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a film student, I was often encouraged to do projects for free, work for experience and connections, and expect others to do the same. When I first started creating The Van, I was in that mindset, unfortunately. But now I have spent precious time with talented and kind and courageous artists who have taught me the importance of offering compensation to people that work on projects.</p>
<p>In the arts, it is already hard enough for marginalized people to make their way, even in communities that can self-laud for their commitment to diversity and growth and easy access like the podcasting community. It takes cold, hard resources, like money and equipment for people to even get a leg up. I'd like to keep growing the diversity of our cast and crew by hiring more artists of color and even more queer artists and in order to do that, it is important that we pay them for their time and effort. Your money goes towards expanding the industry and offering opportunities for people to create while being compensated fairly.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge lately for me and my team has been time. Many of us are students. I particularly am I social work student heading into my senior year where I have to begin applying to grad school, building up my resume, and doing a (regrettably free) internship that requires a lot of time and emotional energy. I (or my fantastic editor Cristian) can often be delayed by exams, jobs, or just extreme exhaustion.</p>
<p>However, after a season of learning, we are getting better at preparation and doing things ahead of time before a problem can arise. I am also getting better at asking for help and collaboration from the fantastic podcasting community.

We'll also include a special look at the character Gollum, and consider his overall significance in the stories of Middle-earth.</p>
<p>Here's the plan by episode:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chapter 1 - An Unexpected Party</li>
<li>Chapter 2 - Roast Mutton</li>

<li>
<strong>$1+</strong>: Get entered into our grand prize drawing! We appreciate your appreciation of the hard work we put into <i>The Tolkien Road</i>!!!</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>THE DIFFERENCE YOU CAN MAKE</strong></p>
<p>While we've produced over 140 hours of discussion about Tolkien's works over the last several years, when you add in all of the time preparing and producing the episodes, it actually adds up to quite a bit more. We want to make this show as great as possible, and every dollar you send our way is more wind in our sails!</p>
<p>And if we can double our goal (ie hit $1000), we will produce 2 extra episodes along with this batch.</p>

<p>Even if you can't contribute, if you can share this campaign with others who might be interested, we'd greatly appreciate it!</p>
</div></div>","The Tolkien Road  is a podcast focused on an in-depth exploration of the works and philosophy of JRR Tolkien. Started in 2015, co-hosts John & Greta Carswell have produced over 140 episodes exploring The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, and other aspects of Tolkien-dom. And now we are turning our attention to the story that started it all: The Hobbit.
This 8 episode podcast series will include in-depth, chapter-by-chapter discussions of the first six chapters of The Hobbit, and conclude with a discussion of Peter Jackson's film The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey. We'll also include a special look at the character Gollum, and consider his overall significance in the stories of Middle-earth.
Here's the plan by episode:

Chapter 1 - An Unexpected Party
Chapter 2 - Roast Mutton
Chapter 3 - A Short Rest
Chapter 4 - Over Hill and Under Hill
Chapter 5 - Riddles in the Dark
Chapter 6 - Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire
Concerning Gollum
Peter Jackson's The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey

<h3>About The Creators</h3>
<p>Hosts Rob &amp; Heff have a combined 30+ years in the craft beer industry.  When they became friends through their business dealings as a retailer and a salesman, they found out that they had a lot of other things in common.  They were both passionate about music, tacos, sports, travel, tacos, charity, and a burning hatred for the NY Yankees.</p>
<p>When Rob's previous show came to a close, he thought his videocasting career was over.  However, when they attended opening day at the Nationals, people kept coming up to him and asking when he would have another show.  Heff knew it was time to help his friend get back in the game, and together they conceived of a beer show that gets outside the bottle.  Now they are on  a mission to get the craft beer community to expand its orbit.  </p>
<p>In a stroke of real serendipity, Tony, the show's director, had just moved on from his long time job working as a video artist and marketing guy for a local brewery.  It seemed too good to be true, that two completely unpolished slobs would end up with an actual professional behind the camera and editing board, but here they are.</p>
<p>The $ goal provides the resources for 2 months of shooting and 8+ web-length videos (4 TV-length half hours), that they can then take to  advertisers and raise funds to complete Season 1.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Tony Gotta Eat</h3>
<p>If you've read a DuClaw Brewing Company bottle label or watched one of<br/>their videos produced between 2007 and 2017, you're familiar with the work<br/>of the man behind the camera.<br/><br/>Tony Marion is a script-to-screen filmmaker and senior-level copywriter<br/>with more than 25 years of experience. He has written, produced, directed,<br/>shot, and edited (including VFX, motion graphics, and audio editing) over<br/>300 projects, and lent his skills in various support capacities to more<br/>than 50 others. His work has been seen on MTV and the FOX Network, in<br/>projects created by Activision and NASA, and on numerous YouTube Channels<br/>and corporate sites around the web.</p>
<p>Now he can add the prestigious title of Beercentrics director to that resume, but here's the thing: Tony is a full-time freelancer now, and Rob &amp; Heff want him all to themselves for the next 8 episodes.  Rob &amp; Heff have day jobs, and the show itself is not for profit, but for Tony to be able to put full focus on Beercentrics, we'll need your help.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Aside from the joy of seeing two weirdo beer nerds continue to annoy local business proprietors, on a more frequent basis, they are assembling an arsenal of swag to compensate you for your contributions.  Some highlights:</p>
<p>$10 gets you a Beercentrics branded glass</p>
<p>$30 gets you a Beercentrics branded t-shirt</p>
<p>$50 gets you a Beercentrics branded disc golf disc + t-shirt (or set of two glasses)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Are They Doing This?</h3>
<p>Craft beer is significantly changing the financial landscape of towns and neighborhoods across the country.  The existence of a brewery can completely reshape the value and attraction to both prospective residents and fellow business owners, while bolstering their existing peers and natives.  We hope to highlight what else makes these places unique, and encourage beer people to check out the diverse offerings that might be right next door.</p>
<p>Rob &amp; Heff have long been cheerleaders for the craft beer community, and are looking to expand their megaphone to keep the industry healthy for decades to come.</p>
