<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I'm a Deaf Education major, ASL Interpreting minor at Baylor in Waco, TX. I've been invited to participate in an exclusive two week-long trip to China to work with deaf and hard of hearing children, and I want to document the trip through a sort of visual journal and photolog consisting of my personal writings, drawings, and photos. I'll be going along with a group of Deaf Education, Audiology and Speech Pathology professionals and students to assist China in working with the increasing number of Chinese children that are born or becoming deaf. The current norm is for these children to be pushed aside in society, many orphaned and most kicked out of school because of their disability. The experience will be incredible, mostly because we're not going as tourists - China has requested us. We'll see places that tourists aren't allowed to and never have gone, and I want to capture it all in a journal that will be turned into a book available on Lulu, Amazon CreateSpace, or a similar site. I just need funds to take care of the cost of travel and supplies for the project. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If my travel expenses are funded, I'll be assisting with determining which kids have the residual hearing required for hearing aids and other assistive devices and which should use sign language instead. Those deemed fit for hearing aids will receive one through us. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>I need about $2,200 for travel expenses, plus the cost of supplies. I have a little bit saved up, so I'm keeping my goal at $2,000. Any and all donations will be appreciated! Every dollar over the goal will go to the art supplies needed for the journal - and if it goes far enough over the goal, I'll be buying a new camera to better capture the experience! The product will be available online to purchase [or view for free for campaign funders!]. <br/><br/>If the project doesn't get funded, whether or not I go this year will depend on help from my family. If the total can't be reached, the money will be held for next year's trip to give me time for more fundraising.</p>

We are the Tongue and Quill Communicators Speech and Debate team and our team has just qualified for the National Competition, in several different categories!!! Now, you may be thinking somewhere along the lines of, ""What? This 'team' only has two members!!"" If so, we'd like to explain a bit of our history:</p><p>Three years ago, our parents decided to start a speech and debate club near our home in N.C. Admittedly, we were bit unsure of what the whole thing would actually look like; A speech team? Run by our parents? Yeesh...But, to our surprise, we found that a lot of people  were really interested in joining! Once we found a facility and got everything up and running, we had a group of about 30 people (including parents) with children ranging in age from just a few months old (yeah, we had a few noisy meetings...) all the way to 17 years old!

We are the Tongue and Quill Communicators Speech and Debate team and our team has just qualified for the National Competition, in several different categories!!! Now, you may be thinking somewhere along the lines of, ""What? This 'team' only has two members!!"" If so, we'd like to explain a bit of our history:Three years ago, our parents decided to start a speech and debate club near our home in N.C. Admittedly, we were bit unsure of what the whole thing would actually look like; A speech team? Run by our parents? Yeesh...But, to our surprise, we found that a lot of people  were really interested in joining! Once we found a facility and got everything up and running, we had a group of about 30 people (including parents) with children ranging in age from just a few months old (yeah, we had a few noisy meetings...) all the way to 17 years old! We had ourselves a team!Around this same time, our father was retiring from the Air Force after nearly 20 years of service. After retirement, he was offered a job hundreds of miles away in Ohio, and our parents decided to accept.

One winning proposal will be selected by a team at the Smithsonian and students will attend a conference in Washington, DC
Winning proposal becomes a reality - the experiment is actually sent to the International Space Station!
This is a tremendous opportunity for any community, but particularly for our students who are underrepresented in colleges and scientific professions. Our student body is 87 percent Latino, 4 percent African American, 7 percent Asian, 1 percent multi-ethnic, and 1 percent White. 56 percent of our students are English Learners while another 41 percent have been re-designated as Fluent English Proficient students. 90 percent of students qualify for free and reduced lunch and seven percent of our students are identified as needing special education services.  What We Need & What You GetWe have currently raised over $21,000 in order for Oakland to participate in Mission 6 to the International Space Station through support from our school, district, and local foundations!  Phew!  Now, we're looking for your support for our Ground Truth experiments:
Experimental materials - plant seeds, growth mediums, petri dishes, fixatives, activators, bacterial cultures, stains, and more for all 3 grade levels!  
Safety equipment - goggles, gloves, sterilizing materials to keep our students safe.
Many of these materials are reusable, so your contribution will support us long into the future.Perks!
$25 = personal thank you letter from students & staff
$100 = UPA shirt
The ImpactAs you are reading this, we have 23 student experiments being conducted on Space Station right now, launched on Orb-1 on January 9, 2014, from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, Wallops Island, VA. These 23 experiments represent the culmination of 8,680 grade 5-12 students fully engaged in microgravity experiment design across the 23 participating communities, and 1,841 flight experiment proposals submitted by student teams. We want UPA students to be a part of this authentic scientific inquiry!

Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand fully that not everyone is in a position to donate but there are still many other ways that you can help us tell this story. Here are a few:

Support our students in-person or via email throughout the proposal writing process or serve as a community judge by reading final proposals!

<p>We
are a group of very dedicated Egyptian Muslims who have acquired the personal
obligatory knowledge of the Religion with a sanad (chain) of transmission that
goes back to our Master Prophet Muhammad, Sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam. This
is the knowledge taught in the oldest University in the world, Al-Azhar
University of Egypt, which still holds the correct Creed of Sunni Muslims in
this time of prevalent darkness and ignorance. </p><p>We are 
members of Sirajul Muhtadeen Association (SMA) of Egypt and spread the 
Religious knowledge under its care and guidance. This is a registered 
association in Cairo, Egypt. Registration number and date of SMA:<br/><b>

المشهرة برقم 8512 بتاريخ 18/1/2012</b><br/>Sirajul Muhtadeen Association number: 8512<br/>Date: 18th of January 2012</p><p>We
live in different parts of Egypt and travel to its many towns and cities
spreading the knowledge that was transmitted to us through reliable,
trustworthy teachers. We have among us those who are strong and fluent in both
the Arabic and English languages and we utilize these skills as much as we can. </p>
<p>Our `Aqidah (creed) is that of Ahlus Sunnah, the majority of this nation, and we follow the four 
great Imams: Abu Hanifah, Malik, Ash-Shafi`iyy, and Ahmad. </p><p>The belief of Ahlus Sunnah is that every Muslim is obligated to know that our Creator, the Exalted, does not resemble His
 creations in any way whatsoever. Allah is not a body, shape, or 
picture, nor an actual light/illumination, rather He is the Creator of 
all of them. Allah exists without a 'how' and without a place. No mind 
can imagine Him. Allah said in the 
Qur'an: {( ليس كمثله شئ )} which means: {Nothing resembles Him in any 
way} Imam At-Tahawiyy, one of the great hanafiyy scholars, said what means: “Allah is supremely clear of all 
boundaries, extremes, sides, organs, and instruments. The six directions
 do not contain Him, for these are attributed to all created things.”<br/><br/>
 It is also obligatory upon us to know that every Prophet of Allah, 
before and after Prophethood, is truthful, intelligent, beautiful in 
shape, protected from committing blasphemy, enormous sins, and small 
abject sins, and clear from being inflicted with repelling ailments.</p><p>We
 love the Prophet, may peace be upon him, his Companions, his blessed 
family members, and all of the awliyaa' (highly righteous and upright 
slaves). We are working to spread peace, harmony, and unity between 
Muslims and we believe that knowledge and moderation are our most 
significant tools. Unlike those who gave no consideration to logic and 
reason, and by that became extreme fanatics, we, on the other hand, use 
both our sound minds and the Religious evidence thus complying with the 
saying of the Islamic scholars: “Using
the mind without using the revelation is like stepping into the darkness with
your eyes open, and using the revelation without using your mind is like
stepping into the light with your eyes closed.” </p><p><b>Who Are We Warning Against? Are They Really THAT Dangerous?  </b></p>
<p>We
are warning against all
extremist ideologies and every terrorist idea existing in Egypt and even
 outside of Egypt. It is known
for most people that the situation of Egypt right now is very weak, in 
all its
aspects, and we blame the terrorists and extremists who are spreading
corruption in our country in the name of Islam while Islam is pure of 
their
actions. These people have deviated from the true teachings of Prophet 
Muhammad and are working towards destroying Islamic heritage and 
tradition all around the world. Islam does not teach extremism. In fact,
 our greatest teacher and role
model, Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said what means: “The 
extremist
fanatics are doomed.” Furthermore, the Prophet taught us to be humble 
and moderate when he
said, “You neglect the best of worship—humbleness.” This is the message 
we want
to bring back to the minds of the Egyptian people while strengthening 
them with
the knowledge of Tawheed (creed) and Fiqh (jurisprudence) so they can 
differentiate between the people of truth and moderation and those 
trying to cheat them in their Religion.</p>
<p>What makes these enemies of Islam so dangerous is their claim to being from
among the Sunni population and hence they dress and look like us, so how can
the laypeople distinguish between who is on the right path and who has deviated
from the truth except by way of knowledge? Prophet
Muhammad, Sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam, warned us against those who deviate
from him in a hadith related by Al-Bukhariyy and Muslim: 

</p><p>( <span>أناس من جلدتنا، يتكلمون بألسنتنا، تعرف منهم وتنكر، دعاة على
أبواب جهنم من أطاعهم قذفوه فيها )</span></p>
<p>which
means: “There are people whose skin is the same color as ours, who speak the
same language as we speak, (but) they mix correct matters which you﻿ know with
bad matters which you denounce [they mix the correct statements with the
deviated ones]. They stand by the gates of Hellfire inviting others to enter.
Whoever listens to them, they push him in.”</p>
<p>These
are the people whom we are warning against with our knowledge, diligence, and
engaging and sincere teamwork. </p>
<p><b>What Will the Money Raised Be Spent On?</b></p>
<p>The
money raised will be used to facilitate the propagation of the authentic
knowledge of Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, the knowledge taught by Prophet
Muhammad to his Companions and from them to their followers and from the
followers to their followers until reaching us today. </p>
<p>There
are <b>2 main things</b> we hope to gain with this money:</p>
<p><b>1.
An inexpensive, second-hand car to be used by teachers and students to move from place
to place to conduct live lessons and events. </b></p>
<p>Your
contribution for this effort means so much to us. Having a car for da`wah
purposes will help us give more lessons than we are giving now. It will help us
travel to further towns to spread knowledge and be able to reach those who want
to learn but have no reliable teachers in their area. The one entrusted with the car will be permitted to use it for personal reasons if it comes down  to it. The amount we are asking
for is not very much because we are only seeking a reliable means of
transportation (not including gas money). </p>
<p>Our contributors can can contribute to this campaign anywhere from $1 to $1,000.

</p><p><i>Keep
in mind that $1 is equivalent to 6.97 Egyptian Pounds.</i></p>
<p><b>2.
A Da`wah laptop or other device like a tablet for giving lessons.</b></p>
<p>We are seeking
your help in buying a laptop or tablet to use while giving lessons. This will
help the teacher through the ease of not having to carry around books (Yes! We
actually carry around books, like the old scholars did, to give lessons from.
We do not speak from our opinions like misguided people do). This option will
enable us to download lessons straight to the laptop or tablet, even download
books, and carry it along to lessons and events.</p><p>For those who wish to use PayPal they can donate this way by using the following PayPal email address: <b>goldentrees98@gmail.com</b></p><p>PayPal takes out about 5.4% of the amount one contributes for using their service. To avoid this fee, the person donating needs to select ""Family and Friends"" and not ""Goods and Services"".<br/></p><p><b>NOTE:</b>  If 
we surpass our desired goal, then we kindly take your permission to use 
the excess amount of money towards general da`wah spending. Thank you.

</p><p><b>So What Do YOU Get Out of All of This?</b></p>
<p>Muslims know that the reward for any effort
they make in supporting the truth is never lost if it was sincere, so 
don't
forget the sincere intentions! And this reward is more immense than any 
worldly
benefit one may acquire. Moreover, anyone who supports us is supporting a
 global warning against
extremism and terrorism. While we are a small group at the moment, we 
are very
dedicated and determined to keep moving forward and spreading the true 
belief
of Muslims. By eradicating terrorism we all would gain peace of mind, a 
certain level of trust, and some safety in the world we live today. 
While this is probably a long
journey, every footstep counts and nothing will be achieved without that
 first,
ambitious step.</p>

We hit our $10,000 goal with 11 hours to spare. No. 1 #schoolgarden fan Diana Heffernan of Palos Verdes put us over the top with a $1,000 contribution. Thanks to her and everyone else.Yes, thank you all. But not being the unbusy types we've gotten a matching offer from a lovely donor, Ismael Resendiz of http://www.resendizbrothers.com in Fallbrook. If we raise $12,000 by the deadline, they donate an additional $2000 in cutflower plants for our ranch. Banksias, proteas, waxflower and other lovely Australian, drought tolerant natives are on the table, literally. We have many perks to match your contributions: csa shares, flower shares, bulbs, t-shirts, farm dinners and 1-on-1 classes with me. Good stuff -- 'even hanging out with this florist farmer. ;)This is our first crowd funding campaign and we are thrilled. We'll be able to plant more, sell more and hire more Muir students in 2014.

As you may know, I recently became a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Intern, and I'm just starting to see my first clients at a private practice in Auburn, California. My first appointment with a client was literally last weekend!</p><p>My decision to become a therapist came after a ten-year career as a mental health social worker, during which time several of my colleagues and clients told me they thought I'd make a good therapist. Eventually, I became enthusiastic about the idea myself. I spent the last two years studying Couples and Family Therapy, graduating in August with a Master's degree from the California School of Professional Psychology.</p><p>This campaign is about helping me help others in my new role as a therapist. <b>I have a goal of becoming a certified practitioner of EMDR</b> (Eye Movement Desensitization &amp; Reprocessing), a highly effective therapeutic technique designed to help people who have suffered through trauma.

As you may know, I recently became a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Intern, and I'm just starting to see my first clients at a private practice in Auburn, California. My first appointment with a client was literally last weekend!My decision to become a therapist came after a ten-year career as a mental health social worker, during which time several of my colleagues and clients told me they thought I'd make a good therapist. Eventually, I became enthusiastic about the idea myself. I spent the last two years studying Couples and Family Therapy, graduating in August with a Master's degree from the California School of Professional Psychology.This campaign is about helping me help others in my new role as a therapist. I have a goal of becoming a certified practitioner of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a highly effective therapeutic technique designed to help people who have suffered through trauma.

Students take three-week intensive courses related to arts, creativity, or physical education. As a teacher, it allows me to teach the passions I have beyond the discipline I teach everyday. For students, it allows them to explore beyond the traditional academic disciplines, to get out of the classroom, build community across grade levels, and cultivate new passions. Students who haven't always done well in Math or English find new confidence and competence when they can explore other strengths like drawing, painting, dancing, biking, or mountaineering. Post-Session culminates in an exhibition night in which each course presents what they did and learned to the community at large. You are welcome to join us to see the impact of your contributions.</p><p>Our course offerings this year are as follows:</p><p>WARRIOR INTELLECTUAL LEADERS IN TRAINING</p><p>(Art Credit) Using interactive art mediums, students who have been elected by their peers to represent them in the Student Leadership / Step To College course, will become oriented to the basic structures of the course, better understand their responsibilities for the year, and create a leadership community ready to continue cultivating a stronger ARISE community.<span><br/></span></p><p></p><p>OH, THE PLACES WE’LL GO</p><p>In Oh, the Places We’ll Go! we will explore attractions throughout the Bay Area, such as Coit Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Exploratorium, and other hidden nature spots right in Oakland. All these exploring skills will be tested on a 3-day backpacking trip to one of the Bay Area’s most scenic spots.</p>OH! THE PLACES WE'LL DRAW!<p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Leisurely explore  the bay area and sketch things, people and animals. We will practice lots of drawing techniques using a variety of media. Botanical gardens, cityscapes, the zoo, the coastline and our own back yard will be the setting of this adventure. Your sketchbook will be your daily companion as well as your final product. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p>I WANT TO RIDE MY BICYCLE!</p><p>We will bike the Bay Trail, the Headlands of Marin, Tennessee Valley, China Camp, and all over the East Bay. Students will learn bicycle safety, maintenance, and repair in addition to biking themselves into great shape. The course will culminate in a three-day overnight stay in the Marin Headlands. Trips for Kids will take us out mountain biking on trails in the surrounding area. Bikes!</p><p></p><p>EXPLORING THE OUTDOORS VERSION 2.0</p><p>This year we will continue to build on our skills navigating the outdoors by spending a week camping on the Klamath River in Humboldt County. We will develop strength and fitness through running, hiking and other exercises. We will also learn about native California ecological concepts. While in Humboldt, we will work with the Yurok tribe learning about different issues they face with sovereignty, land and fishing rights. </p><p>ACTIVE RESISTANCE</p><p>Journey with us as we will find our Zen, strengthen our core, and learn healing strategies that speak truth to power. <b>Active Resistance</b> will provide you with the tools to endure struggle on all fronts of your life, be it physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.  Participants will increase their physical strength through traditional martial arts and yoga, find their center by practicing daily meditation and participating in a Native American sweat lodge ceremony, spend time amidst California's serene coastline and explore what Hip Hop, health, and higher education have to do with resistance. </p><p>MI CUERPO RECUERDA: A Youth Wellness and Self Care Class</p><p>“Mi Cuerpo Recuerda” will be a 3-week journey that will help young women learn how to take care of their bodies. You will learn about different topics related to health and make your own medicine like massage oils, bath salts, tea blends, and more. To keep things fun, you will also be going on a field trip, have guest speakers come and share their knowledge about different topics, and watch cool films. </p><p>HIP-HOP'S GOT ME FEELING SOME TYPE OF WAY</p><p>We will be exploring hip-hop culture through spoken word, emceeing, and dance. Students will also have the opportunity to study the history of hip hop along with the path it has taken from the Bronx in the 70’s to mainstream society in 2014. Hip Hop 4 change, along with other special guests, will lead workshops. </p><p>SPORTS!  SPORTS!!  SPORTS!!!</p><p>Do you eat, live breathe, and sleep sports? Do you live for the highlight reels and Top 10 plays on ESPN? Or, do you just long to have some constructive outdoor fun? Well if so, come join <i>Ms. J and Ms. Tanya</i> as we travel around the world (ok, maybe not the world, but certainly the immediate Bay Area!) and play as many sports and anything else active as humanly possible!!! Some of the activities will include, but are not limited to: <b>Basketball, Football, Baseball/Softball, Soccer, Tennis, Ice Skating, Skateboarding, Tumbling, Cheer, Track, Hiking, Power Walking, Bocce Ball, Dance, Kickball</b>…and the list goes on (<i>we may even get to attend some sporting events!!!).</i> Learn to build healthy, positive competitive skills, teamwork &amp; leadership skills, and healthy living skills, all while having fun and enjoying the beautiful bay!<br/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p><p>Unfortunately, statewide budget cuts have gutted our funding for Post-Session and left us to raise the funds ourselves. Each course will receive $600, in addition to Bart tickets which we purchase for the students, which means we need to raise $6000 to support the 9 course offerings. Each course spends the money a little differently, but it is generally used for transportation, supplies, and guest teachers. For instance, the bicycle course uses the money for bicycle parts, snacks, and lodging for the overnight trip. The film course uses the money for camcorders, props and transportation.</p>As for perks, you will certainly receive kharmic bonus points, a sense of glory and accomplishment, and...most importantly...a thank you card from our students. For a $100 donation, the youth wellness crew will put together a stress-reducing tea blend for you.  If you give $150 or more, we will list you on our program at the exhibition night for all the post-sessions. <br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Your Impact on Students</h3><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">More than 80% of adults do not meet the guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, and more than 80% of adolescents do not do enough aerobic physical activity to meet the guidelines for youth.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Mack Worley. I am a disabled veteran of the United States Air Force. I honorably served my country for over 5 years before I was medically retired. I am a card carrying member of the NRA and a 2nd amendment activist through my youtube media channel youtube.com/onthemoveshow.</p>
<p>I was recently arrested while lawfully and peacefully open carrying a firearm in Vancouver, Washington. I have been charged with trespassing (even though I was on a public sidewalk) and displaying a weapon (which I wasn't touching and open carrying is authorized in the state of Washington and the city of Vancouver).</p>
<p>I am trying to get help paying for the costly legal fees that I am about to start racking up. I am dedicated to our personal freedoms and will not be intimidated. I will fight for all of us. I will not give up. If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone. Anything you can donate would be greatly appreciated and will go to defending the 2nd amendment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I literally have no idea how much we will need, but $4,000 would be a great start. I am sure my future legal fees will far exceed that amount. All donations will go to help protect our 2nd amendment freedoms.</p>
<p>I am not out to make a million dollars. If we somehow make more money than what is needed for my legal fees, I will donate all of what is left to the NRA (minus what has to come out for taxes).</p>
<p>I can offer as a reward for your donation a phone call from me (Mack Worley) thanking you. As well as recognition on my facebook (facebook.com/onthemoveshow).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every penny counts! I know you've heard that a million times, but it is true. I cannot afford a lawyer. Without your help I will be fighting this battle with a public defender. Don't let this be the battle they win and start using this court case as a precedence for future gun laws.</p>

<p>This summer Statement Arts is returning
to Washington Heights and the esteemed United Palace of Cultural Arts to
provide a free College Prep Program for 12 underserved New York City kids!</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>What We Want To Do</b></h3>
<p>Last year we ran a College Prep
Program for 10 New York City kids. The program was a HUGE success and every one of our kids is going onto higher
learning institutions. Most of them got substantial scholarships. We are
running it again this summer and will be drawing kids from all over the city. We have
received tremendous support, not only from the community, but in past years,
State Senator, Adriano Espaillat, and City Councilman, Ydanis Rodriguez came to
our Final Performance! </p>
<br/><h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p>We have gotten several grants for
this program but need to raise an additional $9000.  All money raised will
go towards paying for the classroom and performance space, insurance, teacher's
stipends, some supplies, transportation and refreshments for our final
performance. <i>We'd like to offer every
student an equal chance to participate at no cost to them.</i></p>
<p>Any additional money raised, will go
towards our other programs. Whatever you are able to give: $10, $50, or $200,
we promise it will make an impact.</p>

Future Starts with Education! 

Nile Union Academy (NUA) in Egypt is a Christian secondary school dedicated to
offering a high level education to rural students from across Egypt. We have been doing this for 60 years. Now we need your help.NUA is a Christian English language secondary school in greater Cairo, Egypt. The students primarily come from Egypt and Sudan.
Many of them come from poor villages in Upper Egypt. They have big dreams of
becoming professionals in different areas and helping their families and
communities. They are seeking a better future. Our diploma offers them the ability to seek a bachelors education almost anywhere in the world.You Can Make a DifferenceWe are excited to be celebrating our 60th birthday this year! But with the joy comes danger. NUA is dedicated to offering the most affordable education possible. In a desire to help as many as possible, we have kept our tuition intentionally low. Now, before June, we need to raise
$30,000 to stay in operation. 
We need $18,000 to pay salaries for our 25 dedicated teachers and staff. 
We need $12,000 to pay for general school expenses such as books, electricity, maintenance and dormitory expenses.
A donation of $250 will keep tuition at current levels for 1 student this year.
100% of donations (minus Indiegogo's bit) will go directly to the continued education of students. 
NUA exists because at different times many people like you have stepped up to help these kids. Help keep the dream of education alive for all NUA students!
A VALENTINES DAY SURPRISE!
Update February 14, 2014. We have HUGE news to share! A surprise donor has stepped forward and offered NUA matching funds. For every dollar you give, the donor will give 2. We could hardly believe the news when we heard it! Our $30,000 goal could turn into $90,000 if reached! You can read the whole story by clicking on the update here.Meet GeorgeGeorge is one student who has benefited from NUA. George, the son of a carpenter, grew up in Alexandria, Egypt. He admits that he was not a good student as a child. He got into a lot of trouble wreaking havoc on the streets of Alexandria where he liked to smoke and fight. In 2009 he heard about NUA and was fortunate enough to be accepted as a student. Slowly his life began to change. In fact, over the years George has changed from brigand to studious leader at NUA--he even quit smoking. He attributes his success to the faith in a brighter future NUA instilled in him.""NUA was a turning point in my life. Here I studied for real for the first time. Here I started to have a personal relationship with God. Now I know that I'm able to succeed. If I aim something, by God's will I can do that. Without NUA I could not do much. This school planted a dream in my heart. The dream? After my graduation here, I want to study Political Science and work in the United Nations one day.""

It all started back in 2006 when we purchased a single family home in Amherst, MA.</p><h3>The Idea is Simple:</h3><p></p><p></p><ul><li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Transform
a traditional single-family home into the premier sustainability house and
educational site in Amherst, MA (Or insert your town/city! Learn more about
that below)  </span></li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Why is this Important?</h3><p>In
2008, I began learning about the massive amounts of energy that our houses and
buildings use. So I set out on a quest to address that issue and two years
later received my M.S. degree in Green Building from UMass Amherst. I decided the
best thing I could do was focus locally and to create a prototype that demonstrates
how anyone can live sustainably.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Pilot Project:</h3><p></p><p>This particular project focuses on a home located in
Amherst, MA and converting it into the premier sustainability house and educational
site in Western, Massachusetts. Here’s what we’d like to accomplish over the
next 6 months:</p>
<p></p><ol>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Installing a 4.4kW roof-mount solar system
that supplies 70% of our household energy needs (happening this month – installed
by PV squared!)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Planting a front-yard mini orchard of 10
fruit and nut trees (peaches, pears, paw paws, Asian pears, persimmons, hazelnuts
and more!)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Creating a map / planting guide for the
front-yard community permaculture garden</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Building a patio that we’ll use to host educational
and community-building events</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Beginning a microbusiness that
entails selling surplus edible and medicinal plants from our garden (A Permaculture
Plants Nursery!)</span></li>
</ol><p></p><p></p><h3>THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT EDUCATION!</h3><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We understand that this project alone cannot solve all
the world’s problems. But it can serve as a model and be an example for others –
and that’s incredibly important!</span><br/></p><p>
</p><p>The 6,000 square foot (front yard!) permaculture garden
is our main area of focus because it is extremely visible and interactive for
engaging our community. The garden is already used to teach others how to live
a happy, healthy and high quality of life while having a beneficial impact on
the ecology, neighborhood, and the local economy!</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>What We'll Do With The Funds Raised!</b></h3><p></p>

Specifically, we’ll be
using the money we raise to purchase edible fruit trees (asian pears, peaches,
persimmons, paw-paws, cherries, etc.) nut trees/bushes (walnut, heartnut,
hazelnut) berry bushes, as well as other edible perennials (flowers, herbs,
insect attractors, soil-building plants, etc.) We’ll concentrate on getting as
many from local sources as possible. We’ll also be buying seeds, soil
amendments, compost and mulch, educational signage.<br/><p></p><p><b><u>If WE REACH OUR GOAL, WE’LL ACHIEVE
THE FOLLOWING (in YEAR 1!): </u></b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">100+ community visitors – we will engage at
least 100 community volunteers each year and we’ll be promoting free educational
events throughout the year, such as tree plantings, harvest days,
sheet-mulching workshops, and more!</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">5-10 free garden/home tours – At least one
per month throughout the growing season that anyone can attend and register for
(1-hr guided tour of the property.)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Develop a website and provide free online
content about the project that allows others to see what we did and create a
similar home transformation of their own.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Continue to develop a how-to manual
(e-book) with special thanks to people and organizations who donate! Version 1
is already available on our website.</span></li>
</ul><p><b><u><b><u>SO WHAT WILL MY DONATION DO EXACTLY?</u></b></u></b><br/></p><p></p><ol>

</ul>
</div></div>","This is a project that I am extremely excited about, and I believe this can be replicated in all communities (and should be!) It all started back in 2006 when we purchased a single family home in Amherst, MA.The Idea is Simple:Transform
a traditional single-family home into the premier sustainability house and
educational site in Amherst, MA (Or insert your town/city! Learn more about
that below)  Why is this Important?In
2008, I began learning about the massive amounts of energy that our houses and
buildings use. So I set out on a quest to address that issue and two years
later received my M.S. degree in Green Building from UMass Amherst. I decided the
best thing I could do was focus locally and to create a prototype that demonstrates
how anyone can live sustainably.The Pilot Project:This particular project focuses on a home located in
Amherst, MA and converting it into the premier sustainability house and educational
site in Western, Massachusetts. Here’s what we’d like to accomplish over the
next 6 months:


Installing a 4.4kW roof-mount solar system
that supplies 70% of our household energy needs (happening this month – installed
by PV squared!)


Planting a front-yard mini orchard of 10
fruit and nut trees (peaches, pears, paw paws, Asian pears, persimmons, hazelnuts
and more!)


Creating a map / planting guide for the
front-yard community permaculture garden


Building a patio that we’ll use to host educational
and community-building events

Beginning a microbusiness that
entails selling surplus edible and medicinal plants from our garden (A Permaculture
Plants Nursery!)
THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT EDUCATION!We understand that this project alone cannot solve all
the world’s problems. But it can serve as a model and be an example for others –
and that’s incredibly important!
The 6,000 square foot (front yard!) permaculture garden
is our main area of focus because it is extremely visible and interactive for
engaging our community. The garden is already used to teach others how to live
a happy, healthy and high quality of life while having a beneficial impact on
the ecology, neighborhood, and the local economy!
What We'll Do With The Funds Raised!

Specifically, we’ll be
using the money we raise to purchase edible fruit trees (asian pears, peaches,
persimmons, paw-paws, cherries, etc.) nut trees/bushes (walnut, heartnut,
hazelnut) berry bushes, as well as other edible perennials (flowers, herbs,
insect attractors, soil-building plants, etc.) We’ll concentrate on getting as
many from local sources as possible. We’ll also be buying seeds, soil
amendments, compost and mulch, educational signage.If WE REACH OUR GOAL, WE’LL ACHIEVE
THE FOLLOWING (in YEAR 1!): 


100+ community visitors – we will engage at
least 100 community volunteers each year and we’ll be promoting free educational
events throughout the year, such as tree plantings, harvest days,
sheet-mulching workshops, and more!


5-10 free garden/home tours – At least one
per month throughout the growing season that anyone can attend and register for
(1-hr guided tour of the property.)


Develop a website and provide free online
content about the project that allows others to see what we did and create a
similar home transformation of their own.

Continue to develop a how-to manual
(e-book) with special thanks to people and organizations who donate! Version 1
is already available on our website.
SO WHAT WILL MY DONATION DO EXACTLY?

It will help us create this model project that can be adapted and replicated
anywhere


It will provide hundreds of future volunteers with an educational “living
laboratory” that they can interact with and learn from.


It will provide funding to create an online hub that can be used
to tell more people about this project, and how we are doing it.


It will help us establish an edible (permaculture) plants nursery. We are concentrating on plants that can be easily
propagated and we intend to share the surplus and help other individuals and
projects create similar permaculture gardens!


If you donate at a certain
level, we’ll even send you a personalized E-book (a how-to manual) so you can begin experimenting and trying this out
for yourself!


Summary:


This project is all about education and the
main focus is to demonstrate how anyone can transform a traditional single
family home into a model residence for sustainable living.


This particular (pilot) project focuses on
a particular home located in Amherst, MA and converting into a premier residence for sustainability
education.


We are intentionally starting with the
garden as it is a space that can quickly and easily and quickly engage a lot of
people and simultaneously showcase how we can have a regenerative impact on our
ecosystems and communities.


In the long-term, we hope
that every community will have a house like the one we are trying to create.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

After over 25 years of being a professional horsewoman in the USA, I was drawn back into the service here in Belize.</p>
<p>We have an amazing group of students at the BEA, from all over the globe, to local kids that are of Belizian, Creole, and Mayan decent. Many of our students are able to pay for their education and that helps keep the school open. But many others, such as local youth, are not able to do so and I try to provide training regardless. I have been fortunate to get some local funding to help me do this, but it gets to a point, with such a small country that is not well funded itself, that there is only so much one can do.</p>
<p>The idea of having the Cayo Institute for the Deaf start to ride at the BEA was two fold. One, it would give us more students and help the struggle to keep the “stall doors opened” so to speak, but more than that, it excited me to that old feeling of WOW, this would be amazing! Enough so that if I could do it financially myself, I would. But, that’s not reality. I have worked with kids of special needs over my vast career and there was never anything more gratifying… Rescuing an animal is close, but to see a child who was told he/she couldn’t/shouldn’t do it, EXCEL is amazing.</p>

- If I don't reach my goal, I will put the funds towards another teacher training or PDC, both requirements of my Diploma process.


The Impact
I would appreciate your help soooo much from the bottom of my heart. This training will empower me to take my permaculture educational outreach work to the next level. I will not only be teaching a montly Introduction to Permaculture course at a very affordable rate, but also developing an online course and a coaching program. I'll continue moving forward on my path, accepting opportunities to create and rebirth powerful media platforms for the permaculture message to reach the world. This will help inspire countless people to explore and activate in service to the planet, who otherwise would not consider it. It will make a big difference to our gaian culture, helping to educate, inspire, and evolve individuals and communities worldwide.

<p>The third meeting will consist of students being paired up with writers and artists 1-on-1 to edit their final drafts.</p>
<p>The last day will be for student to come to an off-broadway theatre, meet Barefoot members and learn about the process of creating and producing one's own work.  They will see a short rehearsal, followed by their pieces read on stage and then a more established playwright's work read on stage.  It's going to be awesome!</p>

This year, Japan Day @ Central Park will be <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">May 12th, 2013</span>.  But just as Japan Day has become more and more popular, the event is facing critical challenges in this difficult economic environment -- and we need <em>your</em> support if we are to keep proudly presenting the best of Japan in Central Park.  (Take a look at the video above for last year's thrilling celebrations!)</p>

The event continues with <strong>Japan Day Festival </strong>featuring <strong>food (udon, gyoza, tea and more!), activities (origami, calligraphy, yo-yo and more!), and stage performances  (pop &amp; traditional music, dance, karate, and more!). </strong>Last year's festival attracted 45,000 who enjoyed all these offerings completely<em> free of charge</em>.</p>

<p><span>The Indian Pueblo Cultural Center (IPCC) is a tax exempt 501(c)(3) organization with a mission<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><em>to preserve and perpetuate Pueblo culture and to advance understanding by presenting with dignity and respect, the accomplishments and evolving history of the 19 Pueblos of New Mexico.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em> </em></span>We are owned and operated by the 19 Pueblo Indian tribes of New Mexico<em>. </em></span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>This Popé (pronounced Po-Pay) sculpture, by Clifford Fragua of Jemez Pueblo, is currently on loan to us by the artist. We are raising funds to acquire Popé as part of our permanent collection. Popé was a community and religious leader of the 1680 Pueblo revolt against the Spanish. This was the first successful uprising by a Native American group against a foreign oppressor in North America.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>By keeping the Popé sculpture ""home"" at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, we will contribute to the education of thousands of visitors annually and more importantly, we will be sharing this important historical event and individual with a younger generation of Pueblo youth. The Popé sculpture stands as a reminder of the important role he and others played in preserving Pueblo culture, religion, traditional lands, language and a way of life. It is our intent to share this story and connect the path that has paved the road for our Pueblo people today as we strive to maintain our way of life and strengthen our deeply rooted traditions. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>This is the second rendering of Popé by Clifford Fragua. In 1995, Mr. Fragua was commissioned by the State of New Mexico to complete a statue to be dedicated and housed in statuary hall in Washington, D.C. Popé II is carved from the same pink Tennessee marble as the first Popé sculpture . </span></p>

The Indian Pueblo Cultural Center (IPCC) is a tax exempt 501(c)(3) organization with a mission to preserve and perpetuate Pueblo culture and to advance understanding by presenting with dignity and respect, the accomplishments and evolving history of the 19 Pueblos of New Mexico. We are owned and operated by the 19 Pueblo Indian tribes of New Mexico. 
This Popé (pronounced Po-Pay) sculpture, by Clifford Fragua of Jemez Pueblo, is currently on loan to us by the artist. We are raising funds to acquire Popé as part of our permanent collection. Popé was a community and religious leader of the 1680 Pueblo revolt against the Spanish. This was the first successful uprising by a Native American group against a foreign oppressor in North America.
By keeping the Popé sculpture ""home"" at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, we will contribute to the education of thousands of visitors annually and more importantly, we will be sharing this important historical event and individual with a younger generation of Pueblo youth. The Popé sculpture stands as a reminder of the important role he and others played in preserving Pueblo culture, religion, traditional lands, language and a way of life. It is our intent to share this story and connect the path that has paved the road for our Pueblo people today as we strive to maintain our way of life and strengthen our deeply rooted traditions. 
This is the second rendering of Popé by Clifford Fragua. In 1995, Mr. Fragua was commissioned by the State of New Mexico to complete a statue to be dedicated and housed in statuary hall in Washington, D.C. Popé II is carved from the same pink Tennessee marble as the first Popé sculpture .

<p><strong>The working environment for women is most often a challenge in Japan. Japanese women constitute nearly half (48%) of university graduates.

<li>
<strong>Tanpo Solar School:</strong>  we aim at building a new solar school, ideal for winter schooling, when no other local facility can accommodate children) in Tanpo village in the Indian Himalayas. This would secure the winter schooling of another 30 children in the area, when students are otherwise forced to stay away from school, due to extremely low temperatures. We use local building methods and materials, along with large, sun-facing windows, that capture the heat of the Sun and do not require any of those external energy sources, that are scarce in this region.</li>
<li>
<strong>Winter Accommodation Project &amp; Solar School Project:</strong> we have been working on the Zangla Solar School project and its adjacent Winter Accommodation (for teachers) for several years and we are proud to say, they have been already in use in the winter of 2016-17 by pupils and teachers from several villages. Although we have years of experience with local materials and construction, buildings often suffer damages due to extreme weather conditions. We need volunteers and material to correct these damages and maintain the school buildings for maximum comfort.</li>
<li>
<strong>English tuition:</strong> English is a fundamental asset for Ladakhi people to articulate their position and interests. Our volunteers assist the Governmental School of Zangla with professional English teaching. In addition, in 2016, thanks to a successful cooperation with the Changchub Choling Monastery and the Jamyang Foundation, our volunteers held English teaching sessions to the little nun students of the Zangla nunnery. We would like to keep up this good work that we all enjoyed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Community development through creativity:</strong> in 2017, we would like to launch a community program. Given our good relationship to local children, we start by creative developmental sessions in the Zangla Solar School, using alternative educational methods but building on kids’ interests. In addition, we would like to start a beginner adult session, to develop basic English skills within the adult population of Zangla as well.</li>

<p><b>The Event</b></p>
<p>The University of North Texas (UNT) Graduate Student Art
Education Association (GSAEA) is a professional organization that exists to
promote academic and professional development for students in the department of
Art Education and Art History. 
Additionally, the organization seeks to promote cutting edge research
and scholarship in the field of Art Education. 
As such, GSAEA is launching a new annual symposium. The theme for the
2015 symposium is Method/ologies, and will focus on the vast theories and methods
used to access research data as it relates to both art and education.  Art Education, because of its
interdisciplinary and creative foundation, lends itself to a breadth of
methodological approaches.  Thus, the
2015 symposium will not only benefit students and scholars in the field of art
education, but also others who are interested in the arts, education,
philosophy, and the social sciences.  </p>
<p><b>The Need</b></p>
<p>The symposium will be a free event for any graduate or
undergraduate student who would like to attend. 
However, the following expenses will need to be met:</p>
<p>Honorarium for Speakers: $500 ($100 per speaker)</p>
<p>Refreshments: $200.00</p>
<p>Marketing Designs: $50.00</p>
<p>Printing of Marketing Materials: $50.00</p>
<p>Our speakers for this year have agreed to join us at no
cost, and so if we do not meet our campaign goal, the money earned will go
towards refreshments and marketing for the event.  </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>It is our hope that emerging scholars in the field of Art
Education and beyond will walk away from this symposium with a sense of renew
confidence in their own ability to engage dynamic research methodologies and
methods.  Not only that, but we hope that
attendees will gain a global understanding of the limitless research
possibilities that can be forged through the arts.  </p>
<p><b>Your Help</b></p>
<p>Please consider donating to our campaign, and remember that
helping is a simple as promoting our efforts among your contacts via social media!  Thank you in advance for your support!</p>

</div></div>","Who? Aimee is this amazing woman who is a core part of our lives. 
Her goal before her next birthday: To become a certified yoga instructor. 
Aimee gives so much to everyone around her on a daily basis that we want to give back to her. Aimee gives to her preschool students and coworkers, she gives to the foster pets she takes care of, she gives to friends and family constantly even if it's just moment to listen. She has said that finding yoga has opened her to love in so many ways. She wants to take her practice deeper and we want to make sure that dream happens.    What? Aimee needs $1500 to cover the rest of her tuition. 100% of that will go towards tuition for her. This cost is calculated after receiving a partial scholarship from Asheville Community Yoga. 
If the goal isn't reached a portion of it goes to Indiegogo and the remaining balance will go towards the program. If we reach the goal Aimee keeps 5% more of the money! 
We want to make sure everything is covered and that Aimee gets to keep it all!
See what exciting perks are offered...let us know if you want to provide a perk. 
    Where...will you see it in action? Aimee will be overwhelmed with love if we can band together and make this happen. That's not all of it though.

Aimee dreams of offering a weekly opportunity for the staff of the childcare center, where she already offers so much of herself, to practice together under her guidance. Her vision is to boost morale and camaraderie amongst other team values. She wants to incorporate yoga into the curriculum of her classroom for two-year-olds. She knows it will broaden the development of their motor skills and give the class a fun, but focused activity to send the energy of the room in a positive direction. Also, she imagines encouraging pregnant women to yoga practice during and following their pregnancy. She is a gentle and humorous instructor who would hope to help the expectant mothers with their body awareness before labor and continued self care once the baby is born. Most recently, the idea of offering a morning practice for parents/guardians and their toddlers every other weekend has been mentioned with a twinkle in her eyes. She would also continue to considerately suggest poses and practices to family and friends who share their lives’ ups and downs with her.
We've already found a Yoga Alliance certified program. 
We've already had her registered AND gotten her a partial scholarship. 
Aid us in making sure Aimee gets to pass on everything she intends to learn on this journey.
When?
Deadline is January 1st. New Years Day.

<strong> </strong><h3>Helping those affected by the Badulla landslide</h3>
<p>As many of you are aware I recently volunteered in Sri Lanka at an orphanage, kindergarten and elderly care centre in Badulla in Central Sri Lanka. Just this week a huge landslide, caused by monsoon rains, struck a major tea planation in Badulla burying as many as 350 people. It is unlikely any survivors will be found. Most of those lost are tea pickers who are paid as little as $3 a day.</p>
<p>As many as 12 children from the kindergarten class I volunteered at have lost parents and the impact will also be felt at the elderly care centre and orphanage as extended families are responsible for the cost of meals and the like in these organisations.</p>
<p>It is my intention to travel to Sri Lanka next month to distribute any funds raised personally so you can be confident any donations will go where they are most needed.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>
<p>Mon nom est Arnaud Mouna Massin et je suis actuellement en troisième et dernière année de formation au Grandmothers Healing Haka Integral Learning Programme avec Waimaania et Ojasvin Davis qui en sont les fondateurs. C'est dans le cadre de cette formation que je prépare un voyage d'un mois à Aotearoa - Nouvelle-Zélande pour les y rejoindre (de début Janvier à début Février). <br/></p>
<p>Personnellement, depuis que j'ai commencé ma formation, j'ai arrêté de fumer, j'ai retrouvé ma fille, je me suis marié à la femme que j'aime et une amitié que je croyais définitivement compromise est renée de ses cendres!

Mon nom est Arnaud Mouna Massin et je suis actuellement en troisième et dernière année de formation au Grandmothers Healing Haka Integral Learning Programme avec Waimaania et Ojasvin Davis qui en sont les fondateurs. C'est dans le cadre de cette formation que je prépare un voyage d'un mois à Aotearoa - Nouvelle-Zélande pour les y rejoindre (de début Janvier à début Février). 
Personnellement, depuis que j'ai commencé ma formation, j'ai arrêté de fumer, j'ai retrouvé ma fille, je me suis marié à la femme que j'aime et une amitié que je croyais définitivement compromise est renée de ses cendres! En plus de ces changements majeurs, j'ai trouvé une famille aimante et puissante avec les autres danseurs de Haka (dont j'entraîne deux groupes une fois par mois), dont un certain nombre sont devenus de véritables amis.

<p><b>This was my son's story</b> but it's a universal experience when you are autistic.

<p>I realized after the positive response from our first app, that our creative approach to autism awareness and education can make a difference. In April 2014, Geek Club Books, <b>autism storytellers of hope</b> became a 501(c)3 nonprofit!</p>
<p>Your support  for this project means that we can produce an autism story app that will:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Give children on the autism spectrum characters they can identify with</li>
<li>Educate their peers, teachers, siblings and caregivers for greater understanding </li>
<li>Spark discussions about <i>differences</i> and acceptance    </li>
</ul>
<p>Stories engage. Stories connect. And our
autism stories are making a positive impact. Together, <b><a href=""http://geekclubbooks.com/autism-storytellers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">we can profoundly change the way the world views autism</a></b>…one story at a time.</p>

<li>Writing Fees - $250</li>
<li>Illustrations &amp; Animations - $3,500</li>

</div></div>","#ProudGeeks, we  did it!  With your help we  reached 105% of our campaign goal!! Thank you for mobilizing, sharing, and contributing. 
Our 501c3 mission at Geek Club Books is both autism education and empowerment through storytelling. We tell our own family's stories via our autism story apps and give opportunities for others on the autism spectrum to tell theirs.
Our fans & funders are #ProudGeek for our mission...


A few of our fans and funders are showing their #ProudGeek to encourage others to support our unique autism advocacy, education and empowerment through storytelling and creative self-expression.

Our story starts with a boy...

He looks like any other boy but his brain is wired differently. He is autistic. And the kids at school? They think he's weird so they bully and isolate him.
This was my son's story but it's a universal experience when you are autistic. And when 1 in 68 children are on the autism spectrum, and over 70% say they are bullied in school, we must do a better job of educating all children about autism and making those who are autistic feel included and valued.

The story arc of my son's life is a happy one…He’s thrived when we found welcoming communities
who accepted him for him…and when he has meaningful work from using his talents.

So I had this creative brainstorm of an idea...
What if we use technology to engage and tell real stories from his youth to entertain children while educating them about autism. Research shows that narrative has a powerful impact on the brain, so let's use our autism stories to elicit empathy and affect change...


And ta-da! We made our first story app...
The Mighty League, Vol. 1: The Terrible Taunting, an interactive comic book, is the tale of an autistic boy (or girl – because the reader can choose the gender) on his (or her) superhero quest to stop bullying on the playground.  And the story is inspired by my son's real life experiences. 

The kids, parents and reviewers responded...  




Now here's where you enter the story...

We're ready to make the next autism story app, the Mighty League, Vol. 2: The Horrible Hug and we need your help to do it! 






In our apps, the reader gets to choose the gender of the main character.



From superhero in our last app to Starship Captain, JMan (or Jaycee depending upon the reader's choice) embark on a journey to an alien planet...a brand new school...an overwhelming, fear-of-the-unknown experience for any child...amplified when you are on the autism spectrum.


But the captain of the U.S.S. Mighty League soon discovers that these alien's ""horrible hugs"" are welcoming and a sign of acceptance. And once again, this tale comes straight from my son's past.
Hear him talk about the huge impact the horrible hugs made on his life:


Join us on our mission...



I realized after the positive response from our first app, that our creative approach to autism awareness and education can make a difference. In April 2014, Geek Club Books, autism storytellers of hope became a 501(c)3 nonprofit!
Your support  for this project means that we can produce an autism story app that will:


Give children on the autism spectrum characters they can identify with
Educate their peers, teachers, siblings and caregivers for greater understanding 
Spark discussions about differences and acceptance    

Stories engage. Stories connect. And our
autism stories are making a positive impact. Together, we can profoundly change the way the world views autism…one story at a time.
FOR MORE INFO ABOUT US GRAB THIS PDF

And the money goes to...
 Our goal is to raise enough money to fund the development of the Horrible Hug story app to continue our autism awareness, acceptance and empowerment programs. Our expenses include:


Writing Fees - $250
Illustrations & Animations - $3,500
Audio (Engineering, Voice Over, Music, Sound Effects) $1,000
App development - $2,000
Fees and perk fulfillment - $1,250





Once the app is complete we will use it for our autism outreach and education as well as sell it on iTunes, Amazon and Google Play. We are a 501c3 so all proceeds from app sales will go to further fund our autism mission. 

If we exceed our goal there is so much more that we can do right away, including:



Companion Common Core curriculum
Expansion of our Penfriend Project: A monthly byline for YA autistic writers 
Companion printed comic book version of the app with classroom/reader discussion questions
Marketing and PR support

If we do not reach our entire funding goal, we will still produce an awesome story app but will remove some of its special features and interactivity. 











Be an app star is sold out!

Risks & Challenges

  
As with any app development or creative project, there is the risk of delays in the production but we've already created an autism story app using the same platform and team. There were surprisingly no major issues so we do not anticipate any with this app. 
Any perks that would be impacted by a production delay will simply be postponed and rescheduled once the app is complete. Our contributers will be kept apprised of our progress and timeline throughout the entire process.
  Become part of our galactic crew! As Carl Sagan said, ""the universe is a pretty big place"" so the only way we can land the U.S.S. Mighty League and make it into a story app is with your support. Help us spread the word about Geek Club Books mission and this INDIEGOGO campaign.

<p style=""margin: 0; padding: 0; line-height: 200%;""> Hi there! I'm Bernardo, the EMBO (evil mind behind the operation) of BLUErabbit. With the help of Roberto and Adrian we are looking to transform education environments into places where it's FUN and ENGAGING to learn.<br/>
          BLUErabbit is a platform that motivates students (players) as they grow better through their education, takes stress away from grades and focuses on learning.<br/>
<br/>
          We want to transform education for ONE MILLION students in our first year.<br/>
<br/>
          The goal of BLUErabbit is to improve classes and training for everybody. Most of us had a very standard and boring education. With our platform we want to empower teachers into making their classes something students will always remember as fun and the learning happens naturally instead of a competition against the grades.<br/>

<p>We are looking for funding a whole year of operation and development.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are looking for $130,000 USD</li>
<li>The funds will be used completely for the operation of BLUErabbit 1 and the development of BLUErabbit 2.</li>
<li>The first thing the funds will cover is the operational cost for the next year. This includes servers, maintenance and documentation development.</li>
<li>The second thing the funds will cover will be the development costs for taking BLUErabbit into level 2. This includes three salaries, licensing, rent and the cost of the development  like internet costs and electricity. The development will include the creation of an APP and a lot more connectivity. </li>
<li>The third thing the funds will cover is to develop online courses on how to use game mechanics in the classroom and generate community along with all the documentation (it's a LOT of content) so teachers can create better experiences.</li>
<li>The fourth thing the funds will cover is the development of expansion packs.</li>
<li>If you buy our UNIQUE PERKS, they guarantee the operation of BLUErabbit for 5 years!</li>
<li>If we are unable to get all the funds, we will fulfill our promise to all teachers and their scholarshipped. The funds guarantee a whole year of operation for 3000 teachers, but the cost increments as the accounts increment, so each perk has it's annual cost calculated and you will receive the service you pay for!</li>

<li>Access to our webinars for the first three months. We will be running webinars to help you set everything up and how to create</li>
<li>Exclusive passes and discounts to our gamification of education online courses!</li>
<li>For every month covered on every perk, ONE BLOO MONTH will be awarded. Some perks offer more BLOO MONTHS than others</li>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bluerabbit.io/b/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/>
<p>The way education is taught right now is absolutely obsolete. Schools keep following the system because ""it works"" and ""students are happy"". However, more and more we are seeing people that quit school because it doesn't fulfill their knowledge needs and they end up developing their skills into massive complexity without an institution that tells them when or how to study.</p>
<p>What we plan to focus on is precisely this traditional way of teaching and transform it into something that completely evolves the classroom. There is no need for walls, chairs or tables, except for specific activities. BLUErabbit wants to break the barriers, empower the teacher and students to destroy this obsolete form of education by connecting teachers and students at a very different level</p>
<ul>
<li>By leveraging on game mechanics, BLUErabbit identifies what motivates each student by their playing preference. This way we motivate the right way and work towards a more intrinsic motivation and take the focus away from the grades</li>
<li>We believe that every teacher can turn the tables on education. Not the schools. Schools are organizations that are hard to transform as a whole, but if each teacher changes their system into something more fun, more practical and more engaging, then education itself will evolve.</li>
<li>We've already tested our system with 420 students and the engagement went up to 300%. Teachers could identify their students' weakness and were able to help the through their study.</li>
</ul>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bluerabbit.io/b/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/>
<div>Some of the obstacles we've found is trying to introduce the whole system to a school. The problem is that the school already has a system they don't want to change because it involves too many people making the decision.</div>
<div>BLUErabbit doesn't try to get in the way of any school system. This is a CLASS system. It's not intended to replace the teacher at any point and it doesn't enforce a specific path or set of assignments. The teacher will be able to build the content as he always has, but with the system she will be able to create an environment where students can fail and retry without feeling that they only have one chance. </div>
<div>We will offer live webinars for teaching skills that will help the teachers learn better techniques to use in the classroom. We will offer scholarships to the ones who demonstrate commitment to education. We will change the way classes are taught by helping the only ones who can make a difference in the planet: the teachers.</div>
<div>128 Million kids don't have access to education but, on the other hand, there is NO statistic on how many students are actually enjoying their school. People take their kids to school so they can keep up working. They aren't as involved in their education as needed.</div>
<div>As a teacher in Mexico city, I overheard two girls last semester bragging that they had 156 absences between all their classes combined. Then her best friend countered by saying she had 172. That made me really angry. They attend the most expensive school in the country and they were proud of having missed so many classes while the people in the cafeteria and myself weren't EVER able to have this level of education.</div>
<div>But then, why weren't they in class? It's not just about their lack of maturity. The classroom wasn't offering them anything interesting enough so they wouldn't want to miss it.</div>
<div>We want to change this by changing the class system. Bleeding through your life because you missed a grade in lower school is NOT FAIR. Education is a privilege. Having boring classes and unengaged students is a waste of this privilege.</div>

The second thing the funds will cover will be the development costs for taking BLUErabbit into level 2. This includes three salaries, licensing, rent and the cost of the development  like internet costs and electricity. The development will include the creation of an APP and a lot more connectivity. 
The third thing the funds will cover is to develop online courses on how to use game mechanics in the classroom and generate community along with all the documentation (it's a LOT of content) so teachers can create better experiences.
The fourth thing the funds will cover is the development of expansion packs.
If you buy our UNIQUE PERKS, they guarantee the operation of BLUErabbit for 5 years!
If we are unable to get all the funds, we will fulfill our promise to all teachers and their scholarshipped. The funds guarantee a whole year of operation for 3000 teachers, but the cost increments as the accounts increment, so each perk has it's annual cost calculated and you will receive the service you pay for!




You will get a full BLUErabbit account at a discount price. All our perks offer from 25% to 75% discount prices.

You will also lock down the cost of any additional months at $15 USD for as long as the offered price is higher (if we are able to lower our prices, you will always pay the lowest available fee)
Access to our webinars for the first three months. We will be running webinars to help you set everything up and how to create
Exclusive passes and discounts to our gamification of education online courses!
For every month covered on every perk, ONE BLOO MONTH will be awarded. Some perks offer more BLOO MONTHS than others
BLOO MONTHS are used to grant teachers and schools who can't afford BLUErabbit, access to the system for two years.
All accounts will be available the following work day after the campaign has ended.




The way education is taught right now is absolutely obsolete. Schools keep following the system because ""it works"" and ""students are happy"". However, more and more we are seeing people that quit school because it doesn't fulfill their knowledge needs and they end up developing their skills into massive complexity without an institution that tells them when or how to study.
What we plan to focus on is precisely this traditional way of teaching and transform it into something that completely evolves the classroom. There is no need for walls, chairs or tables, except for specific activities. BLUErabbit wants to break the barriers, empower the teacher and students to destroy this obsolete form of education by connecting teachers and students at a very different level

By leveraging on game mechanics, BLUErabbit identifies what motivates each student by their playing preference. This way we motivate the right way and work towards a more intrinsic motivation and take the focus away from the grades
We believe that every teacher can turn the tables on education. Not the schools. Schools are organizations that are hard to transform as a whole, but if each teacher changes their system into something more fun, more practical and more engaging, then education itself will evolve.
We've already tested our system with 420 students and the engagement went up to 300%. Teachers could identify their students' weakness and were able to help the through their study.


Some of the obstacles we've found is trying to introduce the whole system to a school. The problem is that the school already has a system they don't want to change because it involves too many people making the decision.
BLUErabbit doesn't try to get in the way of any school system. This is a CLASS system. It's not intended to replace the teacher at any point and it doesn't enforce a specific path or set of assignments. The teacher will be able to build the content as he always has, but with the system she will be able to create an environment where students can fail and retry without feeling that they only have one chance. 
We will offer live webinars for teaching skills that will help the teachers learn better techniques to use in the classroom. We will offer scholarships to the ones who demonstrate commitment to education. We will change the way classes are taught by helping the only ones who can make a difference in the planet: the teachers.
128 Million kids don't have access to education but, on the other hand, there is NO statistic on how many students are actually enjoying their school. People take their kids to school so they can keep up working. They aren't as involved in their education as needed.
As a teacher in Mexico city, I overheard two girls last semester bragging that they had 156 absences between all their classes combined. Then her best friend countered by saying she had 172. That made me really angry. They attend the most expensive school in the country and they were proud of having missed so many classes while the people in the cafeteria and myself weren't EVER able to have this level of education.
But then, why weren't they in class? It's not just about their lack of maturity. The classroom wasn't offering them anything interesting enough so they wouldn't want to miss it.
We want to change this by changing the class system. Bleeding through your life because you missed a grade in lower school is NOT FAIR. Education is a privilege. Having boring classes and unengaged students is a waste of this privilege.

Our team is built around different unique skills that complement each other.
Adrian has been working for the education market for the past 7 years. He is our Chief Commercial Officer.
Roberto's skills are built specifically to acquire users. That's what he has been doing for the past 6 years and is AWESOME at his job. He is our Chief of User Acquisition.
Mony is one of the best finance graduates in the history of her university and is working as Mass Marketing Manager in Insurance Business. She is our Chief Financial Officer.
I am a passionate teacher who loves videogames. I have been studying and developing BLUErabbit based on the theories of over 20 authors and have been working as a teacher for the past 8 years. (I also built the whole thing :D)



If you can't contribute with any perk, please help us get the word out! We really want to change the world for anyone who is studying.
Use the indiegogo share tools, that way anyone who sees it will be able to com back to this page.
We believe BLUErabbit is the way for turning education into an amazing experience without asking the teachers to reconstruct everything.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Alex Cross and my passion is kids and nutrition.  My mom and I had saved for years to take our dream vacation to Costa Rica last summer.  Little did I know that this vacation would give direction to my life.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I met the sweetest little baby (Roy) sitting in a stroller outside a small taco stand.  His mom was about my age and she worked at the stand.  I immediately noticed two things:  1.  Momma was quite overweight and 2. Little Roy was eating beans and tortillas.  These two facts kicked my nutritionist brain into overdrive.  Did momma not know what foods babies need to be healthy?  Did momma know anything about nutrition for herself? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I began to talk to her, I discovered that beans, rice and tortillas were the staples of both of their diets.  She said little Roy began eating the same things she did once she stopped breastfeeding.  I also learned from her that nutrition education was non-existent in schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This chance meeting stuck with me when we returned to the states.  I was nearing the end of my college career and was looking for a way to use my education in a meaningful way.  I began talking to professsors and fellow nutrition students.  What could I do?  Finally, someone suggested that if I really wanted to do something, I would go back to Costa Rica as a volunteer and teach nutrition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes!  That's it!  Now, I had to make a plan.  I looked online for intern and volunteer programs and found a great one -  AIDEabroad.org.  Their mission statement is, ""Through education and the exchange of ideas and people across borders, AIDE will build a worldwide community of global citizens who will be part of an ongoing intercultural conversation. AIDE will be a catalyst for change in the world by building bridges between individuals from diverse cultures"". Perfect!  Next, I convinced the dean of my department to authorize trading my senior research paper for a 90 day internship in Costa Rica where I would spearhead a nutrition in schools program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Heck, yes!  I found a way to use my education and pursue my passion - teaching kids to live healthy, active lives.  </p>
<p>So, here is the plan:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Week 1 - Intense language immersion school.  (I read and write spanish, but my conversational skills need some help!)</p>
<p>Weeks 2-4:  Volunteer in a local medical clinic and pharmacy in order to assess the medical impact of poor nutrition habits on the local children.</p>
<p>Weeks 5-12:  Work with the local AIDE coordinator to write and implement a nutrition program in the local schools (3rd grade though high school).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am fortunate that the local AIDE coordinator is an American woman whose passion is also nutrition.  She has been waiting for a volunteer intern with a nutrition background to come to Montezuma to spearhead a school nutrition program.  Funny, how things turn out!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will have a huge impact on the lives of the Costa Rican children and adults in the village of Montezuma.  Costa Rica as a whole has experienced a recent increase in overweight and obesity especially in children and adolescents. A study of Costa Rican children ages 7 to 12 years found that 34% were overweight (Nunez-Rivas, Monge-Rojas, Leon, &amp; Rosello, 2003).  Costa Rican adolescents also have high saturated fat intake, low levels of activity, and elevated LDL (bad cholesterol) levels that will increase their risk of coronary heart disease as adults (Monge, Beita, 2000).<br/></p>
<p>I am just one person, but I can ""Be The Change"" in one small village.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now, I have to talk about money.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cost of round trip airfare - $900.</p>
<p>AIDE program cost - $800 - This includes placement with the local medical clinic, visa assitance, medical insurance, transporation to and from airport, coordination with the university for credit, background checks, etc.</p>
<p>Living expenses - $350/week  - includes housing, meals, laundry, transporation to schools and clinic.</p>
<p>Language immersion school - $400</p>
<p>Supplies for nutrition program - $1,000</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The total cost of the project is $7,500.  I have saved, begged and borrowed $5,000 on my own.  I still need about $2,500 to make this project happen.  It will happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I am unable to meet my fundraising goal, the project will still happen.  Since I will be doing an internship authorized by my university, I will still be eligible for student loans.  I will borrow the last remaining amount through student loan.  Either way, any amount that you contribute will be used 100% towards this nutrition in schools project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you get?  Check to the right side of the page for my perks!  You will also get the satisfaction of knowing you helped one girl achieve her dream and helped hundreds of chldren learn to live healthy, active lifestyles!<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your financial help will be greatly appreciated, but I know times are tough. If just my Facebook friends donated $5 each, I would exceed my goal!  If you want to help and it's not in your budget, there is something else that you can do.  Post my story via Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc!  Generating buzz about my project is one of the best things you can do to help me get the word out.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style='font-family: ""Arial"",""sans-serif"";'>Four year ago my wife who is a High School teacher came home
almost in tears because one of her ELL students who was an outstanding student
did not think he was going to be able to attend college. Neither he nor his
parent had the financial means to provide for the cost of tuition. It hits us
both very hard as we are both first generation English speaking Hispanics. We
remember how tough it was growing up in non-english speaking household and not
knowing English when starting kindergarten. We decided to start a $1,000
scholarship with the help of the High School she works at to help out this
young man. We are not rich by any mean, just good hearted people that feel it
is our duty as Americans to Bless others. We have currently 3 recipients of â€œ</span><span style="""">Educate
it Forward â€“ ESL Hispanic Heritage Scholarship Awardâ€. Last year recipient was
from Florida. I got an email out of the blue from this young man asking about
our scholarship program. We contacted the Head of ELL </span><span style="""">at
his school and she set up a new location for our scholarship. Our goal has been
to be able to give a full 4 year scholarship each year. The $1,000 scholarship
is a good start but not enough to make the full impact of educating a potential
Hispanic young man or woman whom one day would pass on his/her Blessing with
others. Our vision is of an <b style="""">â€œEducate It
Forwardâ€</b> campaign that never stops giving to educating current and future
Hispanics.</span></p>

receive support, or a scholarship for the great work you did, or the good

</div></div>","Our Story
Four year ago my wife who is a High School teacher came home
almost in tears because one of her ELL students who was an outstanding student
did not think he was going to be able to attend college. Neither he nor his
parent had the financial means to provide for the cost of tuition. It hits us
both very hard as we are both first generation English speaking Hispanics. We
remember how tough it was growing up in non-english speaking household and not
knowing English when starting kindergarten. We decided to start a $1,000
scholarship with the help of the High School she works at to help out this
young man. We are not rich by any mean, just good hearted people that feel it
is our duty as Americans to Bless others. We have currently 3 recipients of â€œEducate
it Forward â€“ ESL Hispanic Heritage Scholarship Awardâ€. Last year recipient was
from Florida. I got an email out of the blue from this young man asking about
our scholarship program. We contacted the Head of ELL at
his school and she set up a new location for our scholarship. Our goal has been
to be able to give a full 4 year scholarship each year. The $1,000 scholarship
is a good start but not enough to make the full impact of educating a potential
Hispanic young man or woman whom one day would pass on his/her Blessing with
others. Our vision is of an â€œEducate It
Forwardâ€ campaign that never stops giving to educating current and future
Hispanics.

The Impact From A Past Recipient
It is an amazing experience to
receive support, or a scholarship for the great work you did, or the good
grades you received. However, to receive help for the situation you went
through, a situation that you can share with other individuals is something I
believe to be much greater. The acknowledgement that one receives for the tough
times they went through, specifically of not knowing English, is greatly
appreciated. This scholarship made me realize that there are many people in
this country who are going through the same thing I went through. As well as making
me understand, and helping me to not forget my past accomplishments of getting
through that stage of learning English, and going to school.
At the time I was applying for this
scholarship, I was in great need of it. I needed money to pay for my classes and
books for the summer term, and the deadline for that was coming very fast. I
ended up taking flex start classes (classes that start later on in the semester
and take fewer weeks to finish) because of my lack of money. Once I got the

<h3>I'm a Real Person:</h3>
<p>Hi. My name is Valéria. That's me on the right, smiling (above). That's my wife Amanda on the left. That picture was taken the day a Justice of the Peace married us in Malden, MA.</p>
<p>I grew up in a small town called Mendon, Massachusetts and come from a working-class family. I've been fighting my entire life to achieve my dream of completing a doctorate, and I'm almost there. I completed my B.A. in September 2004 (GPA: 3.95) and my M.A. in May 2007 (GPA: 4.00) and then I got sick.</p>
<p>In July 2007 I was diagnosed with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. Those white spots you see on my brain are lesions, and they are not supposed to be there:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1134.photobucket.com/albums/m615/soupydoo/MRI_1WithPersonalData.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>In spite of being diagnosed with MS and being extremely ill from 2007-2009, I persevered and am now, five years later, an ""ABD"" (""All But Dissertation"") PhD candidate <a href=""http://www.umassd.edu/portgrad/people/students/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">in the Luso-Afro-Brazilian Studies &amp; Theory program at UMass Dartmouth</a>. My dissertation examines<em> </em>representations and the aesthetics of disability in Brazilian literature.</p>
<p>In the recent past, I worked as a Research Assistant and instructor of Portuguese at UMass Dartmouth and as a Lecturer of Portugese at UMass Boston (where I expect to be teaching again during academic year 2012-2013). </p>
<p>Last year---academic year 2011-2012---<a href=""http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/261172/original/new_faculty_2011-2012_latest.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I was employed as a visiting instructor at Middlebury College in Vermont</a> <strong>[LINK OPENS TO .PDF].</strong></p>

<p>My wife Amanda works at a Starbucks in Boston, where she is a kick-ass barista but, like me, does not make very much money.</p>
<p>Right now, we're stressing over $7464.00. That's the amount standing between us and my lifelong dream. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>I &lt;3 COBRA 4-Eva:</h3>
<p>So what do I need? I need exactly $7464.00. What does this amount pay for? It pays for my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1985"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">COBRA premiums</a> for 12 months. I'm lucky enough to have the opportunity to keep the excellent health insurance coverage I got as a result of my brief stint at Middlebury College---<em>if</em> I can afford to pay the monthly COBRA premiums. </p>
<p>They're pretty expensive:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1134.photobucket.com/albums/m615/soupydoo/COBRA_Payments.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As you can see, I've already paid the first premium, which means I am covered through 7/31/12:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1134.photobucket.com/albums/m615/soupydoo/1stPremiumPaidMod.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My wife gets cheap health insurance through her job, but the coverage is not adequate to provide for my more elaborate medical needs. The CBA Blue plan from Middlebury, on the other hand, <em>is</em>. This is why I <em>need</em> to hang onto it---even for just a little bit longer.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping this specific insurance will allow me:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To continue getting the annual MRIs that my neurologist needs to monitor my disease.</li>
<li>To continue seeking preventive and maintenance care where appropriate by visiting my primary care physician and/or any necessary specialists.</li>
<li>To continue seeing my neurologist every 3-4 months as recommended.</li>
<li>To obtain routine bloodwork needed to monitor my liver function and white/red blood cell counts (as the MS med I take can cause problems with both of these).</li>
<li>To obtain ""acute"" care (high doses of IV methylprednisolone) if necessary, i.e. - should I have an MS relapse. Getting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis#Acute_attacks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">acute care during an MS relapse or ""flare-up"" is very important, as it can potentially help reduce long-term, permanent disability</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To continue to have access to Rebif---<a href=""http://ms.about.com/b/2009/07/21/multiple-sclerosis-drug-prices-whoa.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a very, very expensive immunomodulatory drug</a> that has allowed me to keep my MS in remission since June 2009. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that I am not asking for a ""free ride."" I paid the first COBRA premium last month, and I have managed to save enough to make the next payment of $622.02 that is due on August 1, 2012. <strong>[UPDATE: I made the COBRA payment that was due on August 1st on 7/31/12. Please see the ""Updates"" tab of this campaign page for screen shots, etc.]</strong></p>
<p>Even if I can raise the money to keep my CBA Blue insurance through COBRA on a more long-term basis---legally I am allowed to hang onto it for up to 18 months---I will still have to pay co-pays for all of my doctor's visits, lab work, medications, and so on. These co-pays alone add up to several hundred dollars per month. The funds I am trying to raise here will give me access to great insurance for hopefully another year or so. I am more than willing to do the rest on my own.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my full goal, any funds raised will go towards the cost of premiums for COBRA. On the first of each month, I owe CBA Blue $622.02, and if I do not pay I will lose my coverage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>If I can retain my insurance, stay healthy, and focus on teaching and finishing my dissertation during the 2012-2013 academic year, it won't just represent the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. I truly believe that the work I do makes a positive impact on the world. Whether through my teaching or research, I believe that I have something meaningful to contribute to the planet. </p>
<p>I've made it this far and I'm <em>not</em> a quitter. I just need a little help during this last year of my PhD. I'd love to finish this degree and go on to build my career so that I can continue to have a positive impact on many, many classrooms of students to come. </p>

<h3><strong>Intro</strong></h3>
<p>Hello, my friends! My name is J.T. Shields and I come to you in need of some help. But before we get to why I need help, let me give you some background as to why I am even asking in the first place.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Let me backup 5 years. Young J.T. graduates from high school in Enid, Oklahoma intent on going to the local college in town to get his basics. His naive mentality pushes him to strive for an English degree so he can pursue a career in writing poems and science fiction.</p>
<p>Two years later, J.T. drops out of college because he is still in the high school ""naive"" mentality and proceeds to slave away from dead end job to dead end job to somehow payoff the $13,000 student loan he has no way of paying off.</p>
<p>But look! Hope!</p>
<p>I've always felt a need to serve this country, and the Marine Corps is the pride of this nation. So, on a whim, I walk into the recruiter's station and talk to them about enlisting. And, let me tell you, the picture they painted was beautiful....</p>
<p>""You want pride? America LOVES the Marines! You have a weak body? After 4 months in you'll have a Spartan body! You want drive to do anything? You'll have so much courage you'll think climbing Mt. Everest was easy! You have student loans? We'll pay them off for you! Truck held together by duct tape? Since we pay for everything, your paycheck goes straight to you! Buy yourself a sports car!""</p>
<p>I don't remember if it was the motivation to serve and to be a badass that caused me to enlist, or if it was the shear fact I had no other options. But I signed those papers quicker than they could hand them to me.</p>
<p>I went to boot camp Valentine's Day of 2011.</p>
<p>Did I get pride? Tons. Did I get drive? Absolutely. Did I get a Spartan body? Heck yeah.  </p>
<p>Did I get my student loans paid off? No. Did I get that sports car? I got a toy car of one...</p>
<p>I returned home in April to Enid after 8 months of comm school at MCAGCC 29 Palms, California, training to be a ""Telephone and Computer Repairer"". I'm a reservist and I was ready to re-enter civilian with gratutious amounts of motivation. And boy, did I have a plan. I was going to move to the big city, get a job as an IT technician at a big name company, pay off my student loans, get a car and apartment and live the high life.</p>
<p>That was 4 months ago. Life smacked me in the face. Again.</p>
<p>Three months of looking and still no company would hire a tech without proper schooling. My money slowly dried up. My mother broke her back causing me to stay in town to look after her.</p>
<p>But hope is still not lost...</p>
<p>I've enrolled in a vocational school here in town to continue my IT training and to get some computer certifications. I've taken a part-time job as a stocker at a grocery store. My mother is healing. I'm ready to move forward.</p>
<p>And this is where you come in.</p>
<p>The $20,000 i'm asking for is to help me get back on my feet. I have the drive, but not the means. With this money, you can help me get debt free and on track to a good career. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Exactly Am I Going To Do?</h3>
<p>Here's exactly where this $20,000 is going to go:</p>
<ul>
<li>$13,000 - Pay off student loans. The company they're through is breathing down my neck.</li>
<li>$2,000 - Paying for vocational school. My G.I. Bill just does not cover very much of this.</li>
<li>$3,000 - Buy a car. Driving the old family truck is killing me with gas money. </li>
<li>$2000 - Finding a place to live/living expenses. This is going to be used to find me a place to live and as a base to start saving money.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for perks, there really is no way with this to give any sustantial incentive aside from my absolute gratitude towards you. But, I've come up with three that you might enjoy, and I will post more if you give me good ideas for more.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>My plans for after becoming free of debt and after finishing school vary. My ideas for the moment is finding a steady job here in town and saving money. From there, hopefully I can finish college and finally get out of Enid and even out of Oklahoma (I hear Colorado is nice). I love computers, and I've always been a nerd. I hope someday I can find a job where I can be nerdy all the time.</p>
<p>But even with my future plans still a long ways away, please know that you are helping me immensely. And I am eternally grateful to you. Even just taking the time to read my story gives me motivation to continue on.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that if you decide not to help me, that is perfectly fine. But I encourage you to support your troops in any way you can. There are many of my brothers out there, some with worse stories than mine, that can use your help. I hope you reach out to them. </p>
<p>Thank you and Semper Fidelis,</p>

<p><strong>I love to read.</strong> I read hundreds of books a year.  In my neighborhood, I need to have someone drive me to the nearest library and bookstores because it’s too far and the roads are too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>I believe that we need a book exchange that kids and adults can walk or bike to. Quam Park is the perfect place to host a Little Free Library.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is a Little Free Library?</strong><br/>Little Free Libraries are little shelters that house books. They are a place to exchange books, explore interests and share the joy of reading. Little Free Libraries promote literacy while recycling books.</p>
<p><strong>Take a Book – Return a Book</strong><br/>Little Free Libraries are supported by the communities they are in. If you have a good book that you are done reading and would like to share, drop it off. If you need a new book to read, stop by and take one that looks interesting. And, don’t forget to return it so the next person can read it! Enjoy your new book on the nearby park bench or take it home. Read it alone or share it with a friend. See, isn’t reading fun?</p>
<p><strong>Who is this for?<br/></strong>The entire community. The Quam Park Little Free Library will have books for big kids, little kids, adults, cooks, handymen, adventurers, friends . . . everyone is welcome to take part.</p>
<p><strong>Official Support<br/></strong>On September 4, 2012, I made a presentation to the Pleasant Springs Town Board about my idea. They gave me permission to put a Little Free Library in Quam Park so everyone can enjoy it. They even offered to help with the installation! We’re working with <a href=""http://www.LittleFreeLibrary.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.LittleFreeLibrary.org</a>, too.</p>
<p><strong>Now what I need is help raising money to pay for it. <br/></strong>I need to raise at least $500 to purchase the weather resistant shelter and install it. I'm also collecting donated books. Any additional money will be used to buy new books for the library. <strong><em>Can I count on you? Please?</em> </strong></p>
<p>There are several ways you can help . . .</p>
<ol>
<li>Financially support the purchase of the Little Free Library by donating* money. I even have some special perks for people who help fund this library. Please select a donation amount&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</li>

<li>Spread the word. Talk to neighbors, family and friends. Tell them about our fundraising efforts, even send them a link. Ask them to help. Like us on Facebook. And, mark our campaign as a Favorite.</li>

<p><strong>Sutmae Pawb! Hello everybody!</strong></p>
<p>The Celtic nations of Scotland and Ireland are well known to many people in the United States but it's Celtic cousin - Wales is only now becoming more known. Which is surprising as many famous Americans including Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Bob Hope and Tom Cruise have Welsh heritage. Well we want to bring more awareness of Wales and the Welsh Language and  Culture to Los Angeles in 2013 at the St. Davids Festival in the Barnsdall arts park in Hollywood.</p>
<p>I'm Jason Shepherd the host of the Learn Welsh Podcast. Every week I teach the Welsh Language in 15 to 20 minute podcast episodes for anyone who is interested in Learning the Welsh Language. Last year I was invited to the West Coast Eisteddfod in Los Angeles to teach a series of Welsh Lessons at the first Welsh Festival in Los Angeles for many years. It was a great festival and 1000's of people came. I taught a series of Welsh lessons over two days and they were a great success i'm glad to say. So much so that I was invited back in 2013.</p>
<p>This time the festival will be on the week of St. David's Day. The problem is that the money the festival organizers had to pay for my trip from Wales to Los Angeles, so that I can once again teach Welsh at the Festival has fallen through. So the only way we could think of making sure Welsh is taught at the festival in 2013 is to start a fundraiser.</p>
<p>If you would like to support or are going to the Festival once again at the Barnsdell Arts Park in Hollywood and would like to Learn more Welsh, then any money you are able to pledge towards this project would be gratefully received. Here are some of the great Perks you can get in return for pledging money for this project.</p>
<p>I want to bring the Welsh Language to Los Angeles and by taking part in this fundraiser you can help me to do that.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your support of this project.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Matt and Josh. Ever since we ended up in the same political science department at Wheaton College, we've been passionate about political &amp; economic theory as it relates to reformed theology. So, a few weeks ago, we submitted a proposal to give a paper on those very topics. And we got accepted!</p>
<p>There's just one problem.</p>
<p>THE NETHERLANDS IS OVER 4,000 MILES AWAY! </p>
<p>And we are very poor. That is why we are asking YOU, our friends and family, to help us out. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our trip will cost $2,200 for transportation, and $300 for lodging and food, <strong>bringing the total to $2,500. </strong></p>
<p>$1,000 has already been committed. </p>
<p>If 2 people give $15 every day until January 8th (the conference date) we will reach our goal!</p>
<p>By donating, you will get the satisfaction of supporting two young scholars.</p>
<p>Your investment will improve our prospects for graduate school and future careers.</p>
<p>You will also get a sincere thank-you letter, and an exclusive look at our paper if you ask. </p>
</div>

<h3>Fixing the Economy</h3>
<p>Your donation will help us solve the economic crisis. (Or at least learn from it!)</p>
<p>The conference is titled ""Economics, Christianity &amp; The Crisis: Towards a New Architectonic Critique."" The purpose is to critically analyse of the economic crisis and it's underlying theories from a the perspective of Kuyperian thought.

<h3>In a Nutshell...</h3>
<p>As a longtime socially engaged Buddhist, I am very excited about this opportunity to contribute to the <strong>Buddhist Education for Social Transformation (BEST) project.</strong></p>
<p>BEST supports Asian activists and social change movements to apply Buddhist principles of nonviolence to their work.</p>
<p>I've been invited by program founders Ouyporn Khuankaew and Ginger Norwood to be on the faculty for the inaugural training session, happening this July in Thailand.</p>
<p>BEST has limited funding which is prioritized for supporting program participants, who are activists from marginalized groups in Asia. I don't have enough resources to make this trip on my own, so <strong>I am asking your help to cover transportation to Thailand so that I may support this program and teach a workshop on ""The Mandala of Socially Engaged Buddhism.""</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise $2100 to cover my airfare from Albuquerque, NM, to Chiang Mai, Thailand, this July. This amount needs to be raised by May 1, 2013.</p>
<p>In return for your support, I'm offering some wonderful thank-you gifts: </p>
<ul>
<li>Every gift of $25 and more will receive a thank-you postcard with a beautiful photo of Thailand</li>
<li>Every gift of $100 and more will receive a Thai textile </li>
<li>Every gift of $500 and more will receive a special small Buddha statute from Thailand</li>
<li>All gifts are deeply appreciated and much-needed!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a ""fixed funding"" campaign, which means that if we don't reach $2100, I won't get any of the money. I would so much appreciate your help to meet this goal!</p>

</div><strong>Bursting at the Seams in Lot 32</strong><br/><br/>In November of 2012, The Intersection of Owosso purchased a trailer on Lot 32 in Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Park. This came after several months of building trust and friendships with residents who live in the park. It became apparent that the best way to reduce isolation from resources and opportunities and to build real friendships across socio-economic barriers was to actually move into the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Over the past three years, Lot 32 has been the home of transformational change. In collaboration with other community organizations we have hosted play groups, substance abuse support groups, employment counseling, cooking classes, scouting groups, and more. We have also been an important link between the neighborhood and basic living resources throughout the community. We have built a stronger sense of community through neighborhood block parties, cook outs, and shared holiday meals. Literally hundreds of people have made life-changing connections inside the walls of Lot 32.<br/><br/>The results have been reported not only inside the Pleasant Valley community, but from the broader community as well. Law enforcement reported a 20% decrease in phone calls, service agencies and schools report more trust and cooperation with care plans, volunteers who come to the community notice a more positive and hopeful environment.<br/><br/>All of this activity has taken its toll on our humble little building which we purchased for a price of $800. We have filled that little trailer to capacity so many times that it is literally bursting at the seams. We have big dreams for the future but in order to maintain our current programming and build toward the future, we need to replace our building before the snow flies.<br/><br/>You can help us continue to live life hand-in-hand with our Pleasant Valley neighbors by making a contribution today to help us reach our goal of $2000. Thank you for your past and continued support of this work.<br/><br/>- Marlene Webster, Executive Director<p></p></div>","Bursting at the Seams in Lot 32In November of 2012, The Intersection of Owosso purchased a trailer on Lot 32 in Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Park.

FROM EARLY USERS</b></h2>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><u>Ksenya Sobchak, 33, Moscow, a
Russian TV anchor, journalist, socialite, and member of political opposition</u></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I told you about the gift, which I got from blossomsib.com. I am skeptical about unfamiliar products, but it was recommended by people I trust - natural ingredients, no chemicals or side effects. I took almost the entire course and I feel the extraordinary ease. I feel that the body is completely renewed. Blossomsib really works. Well done guys from Siberia!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>""... DARK CIRCLES UNDER MY EYES HAVE COMPLETELY
DISAPPEARED...""</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><u>Pauline, 32, Novosibirsk</u><br/></p>
<p>
As of today, I have taken a half of the course and a break for 3 days. Positive
moments are: the dream has become deeper; I am getting enough sleep for a short
period of time; dark circles under my eyes have completely disappeared that
makes me very happy!. My skin has become fresher. I feel a surge of strength
and the improvement in mood, regardless of the weather. I do not take any
vitamins and medicines and I did not change my makeup, so, I associate the
effect only with the use of BLOSSOMSIB. No negative moments have been observed,
neither bad reaction of the gastrointestinal tract, nor allergic reactions. I will
definitely continue the course! And good luck to the developers of the product!
Definitely recommend Blossomsib!</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>“… </b><b>MIGRAINES AND </b><b>Blossomsib</b><b>”</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><u>Boris, 63, Novosibirsk</u></p>
<p>My migraine didn't go away for a single moment; sometimes it ""walked""
quietly, but sometimes I had strong pain attacks that it was impossible to lie
down, sit or stand. I managed to remove the pain by potent drugs that were
accumulated in the body and resulted to problems with kidneys, liver, and
stomach. I was offered to use the BLOSSOMSIB drink twice a day before meals
when I felt the symptoms again. The migraine have ""walked"" for a long
time, but attacks did not occur. There was no need to take medicines, but I
still kept them in a pocket. For me it was already a victory. The autumn passed
without attacks, although inner the restlessness did not go away. I did not
notice when my migraines stopped “walking”. Suddenly, it became easier to live!
BLOSSOMSIB has changed my life! I have not only got rid of the excruciating pain
attacks, but also have given up smoking without the use of any kind of help. Now
there are no pills in my pocket, but BLOSSOMSIB is always on my table. </p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It works both ways without causing any side effects, such as a upset stomach. However, it is best taken in an eight-ounce glass of water to help insure adequate hydration throughout the day.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>8. Why
is detoxification of the body important?</b><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The average person is exposed to more toxins through water and air pollution, household cleaning supplies, pesticides, disinfectants, and food additives more than ever before in human history. These toxins are strongly correlated with the occurrence of a wide range of ailments, including disease, cancers, birth defects, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, autism, and dementia. In the world we live in today, detoxification is becoming more essential to prevent disease and create optimal health.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>9. What
does it mean that Blossomsib balances the body’s pH level?</b><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Blossomsib as a solution, is a negatively charged molecule with a cage-like structure that is able to trap positively charged hydronium ions. These ions, when captured, lower the pH in the body. By eliminating them, Blossomsib helps balance the pH to a more neutral, alkaline level, and take the burden off the body’s systems that work hard to keep pH stable and healthy.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>10. 
Why is it important to maintain
proper pH balance?</b><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Because bad bacteria, fungi, yeast, and viruses—as well as diseases such as cancer – thrive in an a more acidic environment, however pH levels of 7.3 and below can be conducive to disease as well. The optimum pH of your body should be slightly alkaline – between 7.35 and 7.45 which is the level that Blossomsib tends to help establish.</span><br/></p>

FEEDBACK
FROM EARLY USERS
Ksenya Sobchak, 33, Moscow, a
Russian TV anchor, journalist, socialite, and member of political opposition
A few weeks ago I told you about the gift, which I got from blossomsib.com. I am skeptical about unfamiliar products, but it was recommended by people I trust - natural ingredients, no chemicals or side effects. I took almost the entire course and I feel the extraordinary ease. I feel that the body is completely renewed. Blossomsib really works. Well done guys from Siberia!
""... DARK CIRCLES UNDER MY EYES HAVE COMPLETELY
DISAPPEARED...""
Pauline, 32, Novosibirsk

As of today, I have taken a half of the course and a break for 3 days. Positive
moments are: the dream has become deeper; I am getting enough sleep for a short
period of time; dark circles under my eyes have completely disappeared that
makes me very happy!. My skin has become fresher. I feel a surge of strength
and the improvement in mood, regardless of the weather. I do not take any
vitamins and medicines and I did not change my makeup, so, I associate the
effect only with the use of BLOSSOMSIB. No negative moments have been observed,
neither bad reaction of the gastrointestinal tract, nor allergic reactions. I will
definitely continue the course! And good luck to the developers of the product!
Definitely recommend Blossomsib!

“… MIGRAINES AND Blossomsib”
Boris, 63, Novosibirsk
My migraine didn't go away for a single moment; sometimes it ""walked""
quietly, but sometimes I had strong pain attacks that it was impossible to lie
down, sit or stand. I managed to remove the pain by potent drugs that were
accumulated in the body and resulted to problems with kidneys, liver, and
stomach. I was offered to use the BLOSSOMSIB drink twice a day before meals
when I felt the symptoms again. The migraine have ""walked"" for a long
time, but attacks did not occur. There was no need to take medicines, but I
still kept them in a pocket. For me it was already a victory. The autumn passed
without attacks, although inner the restlessness did not go away. I did not
notice when my migraines stopped “walking”. Suddenly, it became easier to live!
BLOSSOMSIB has changed my life! I have not only got rid of the excruciating pain
attacks, but also have given up smoking without the use of any kind of help. Now
there are no pills in my pocket, but BLOSSOMSIB is always on my table.

<p>I am a college student studying Physics and European Studies. It is my ultimate dream to work at NASA someday. I currently write a science education blog at <a href=""http://www.downhereonearth.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">downhereonearth.wordpress.com</a>. I've been getting some fabulous opportunities through that blog, but sadly I can't afford to take advantage of some of them them.</p>
<h2><span>I've been given an opportunity.</span></h2>
<p><span>I’m among 15 people who have just gotten selected to go to a NASA event at the Ames Research Center in California this Friday, the 26th. The event is essentially a test for some new rover robotics, along with some other lectures and networking. It’d be a great step for my career and my personal validation. </span></p>
<p><span>However, last-minute flights from Chicago to California are expensive - the event was announced last week, I was selected yesterday, I have to confirm my attendance in 2 days, and the event is in 6 days. Everything is very last-minute and so much more expensive. </span></p>
<h2><span>Please help me grasp that opportunity.</span></h2>
<p><span>I just spent all my expendable money going to a NASA event in Houston that I was also selected for (either I have excellent luck or the people at NASA like me – I’m pretty happy with those options). It was amazing - maybe even life-changing, and if you know me you know that I'm not prone to exaggeration. It was a big deal, and doing it again would be another big deal.</span></p>

<h2><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></h2></div>","Friends and strangers, I need your help.
I am a college student studying Physics and European Studies. It is my ultimate dream to work at NASA someday. I currently write a science education blog at downhereonearth.wordpress.com. I've been getting some fabulous opportunities through that blog, but sadly I can't afford to take advantage of some of them them.
I've been given an opportunity.
I’m among 15 people who have just gotten selected to go to a NASA event at the Ames Research Center in California this Friday, the 26th. The event is essentially a test for some new rover robotics, along with some other lectures and networking. It’d be a great step for my career and my personal validation. 
However, last-minute flights from Chicago to California are expensive - the event was announced last week, I was selected yesterday, I have to confirm my attendance in 2 days, and the event is in 6 days. Everything is very last-minute and so much more expensive. 
Please help me grasp that opportunity.
I just spent all my expendable money going to a NASA event in Houston that I was also selected for (either I have excellent luck or the people at NASA like me – I’m pretty happy with those options). It was amazing - maybe even life-changing, and if you know me you know that I'm not prone to exaggeration. It was a big deal, and doing it again would be another big deal.

<p>In order to sustain our success at the highest level, we

<p>For the past 15 years, our vehicles have been designed around steel
space-frame chassis. Despite being a proven method, the fact that they are made with steel means they are, inevitably, quite heavy. This
year we are taking a big step in developing a carbon fibre monocoque to replace the steel frame. The new chassis will be stronger and stiffer than the steel alternative, while weighing significantly less.</p>
<p>Needless to say, designing and manufacturing a carbon fibre chassis is not an easy task. The design process begins on the computer, where the shape is modeled and the areas requiring stiffness and strength are determined. Once the design has been finalized, the manufacturing phase begins by constructing two moulds, one for each half of the chassis, machined from a special type of composites tooling board. It is within these moulds that one then begins the lay-up procedure, where layers of epoxy pre-impregnated carbon fibre and honeycomb core are placed in precisely determined locations. Finally, these moulds, along with the finished lay-up are placed in a special high-pressure oven known as an autoclave. This last step ensures that all the layers are well bonded using the epoxy resin contained within the carbon fibre pre-preg.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the manufacturing process for a large composite part like our chassis is still a fairly expensive endeavour, as our cost break-down shows.

The McGill Racing Team is a team of undergraduate students from McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Every year we design a formula-style prototype race car to compete in the prestigious Formula SAE
competitions throughout the summer.Formula SAE/Student is an engineering design competition targeted towards university students studying engineering, with the goal to provide students with a hands-on project to apply the skills and knowledge they are taught in their courses. Students are required to take on all aspects of the project, including: Design, Manufacturing, Testing and Maintenance, Finance and Sponsorship, and of course Project Management. ""The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has contracted a design team to develop a small Formula-style race car. The prototype race car is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules whose purpose is both to ensure onsite event operations and promote clever problem solving"" (sae.org).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Courtney Snelling, a recently-barred attorney with a particular interest in international taxation and developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. On July 24th, I learned that I was chosen to participate with 58 other young attorneys from around the world in an educational program of the Paris Bar that will take place in Paris from October through November of this year. This experience will increase my understanding of French law, enhance my ability to work with <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">governments of </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Francophone countries on their tax policy, and link me with dozens of international lawyers who work in Africa. </span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Paris Bar only funds the courses in French law that are part of the program and not the trip to Paris or housing and room and board. The Paris Bar suggests that participants seek funding from the French Embassy in their home country. I have contacted the French Embassy in the U.S. and was told that there are not funds for this program.  So, I am attempting to raise funds from family and friends to support my stay in Paris during this two-month period.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The round-trip plane tickets for the trip are going to cost from $1,500 to $2,000. I am looking for friends and associates to stay with in Paris to reduce the cost of housing to an estimated $1,500 per month ($3,000). I will need an additional $1,500 for food, the daily commute to the educational facilities, and other living expenses during this time. I am raising funds with $6,500 as the goal, but I am also attempting to reduce the costs of the trip in all ways that I can. All support and advice is appreciated.</p>
<p>I am willing to provide valuable tax and French translation services for free to those who are able to contribute. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This program of the Paris Bar - Stage International 2013 - is a very unique program that brings together young attorneys from all over the world to increase understanding of French law.

The core tenets of the approach include working to ensure that every child has the right to an education, a childhood free from trauma and violence, and the hope of a peaceful tomorrow. Project Amal ou Salam has a successful track record of delivering this approach in week-long workshops in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan with volunteers from around the world, in the school that it funds in Jordan and in its community center in Syria.Our OriginsWhile visiting an IDP camp in Syria in 2013, Co-Founders Nousha Kabawat and Aziz Abu Sarah were struck by the bored children mirroring the anger, violence and sectarianism around them and began to imagine a grassroots effort to feed the children’s self-esteem and character. With a background in conflict resolution and peacebuilding in post-war societies, Nousha worked to turn her dream of a multicultural, interfaith community into a reality called Project Amal ou Salam.Free from politics and sectarian dogma, Project Amal ou Salam operates across Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria – few NGOs for Syrian refugee children founded in the past few years are working across borders. According to the UNHCR, to date there are over 3 million registered Syrian refugees, of which more than half are under the age of 17. Since the revolution began in 2011, these children have been forced from their homes and country and have been unable to access basic needs or education. In 2016, children who are five years old - or entering school - have always had a life of war and conflict. Our ImpactThrough our workshops, school and community center, Project Amal ou Salam has supported over 6,000 children in four different countries, aided by more than 100 volunteers from around the world.Project Amal ou Salam Workshops – Jordan and LebanonProject Amal ou Salam’s workshops provide open dialogue, giving the kids a safe space to tackle the issues that they face and develop their own ideas and visions for the future of Syria.

Rethinking charity is the vehicle through which students hone valuable meta-skills for personal development. Our novel curriculum complements the latest approaches to doing good with concepts of logic, epistemology, and metacognition, which carry practical applications in everyday life.</p><p>For example, what is a cognitive bias? How do they keep us from helping others most effectively? How can we keep these biases from affecting our own personal decisions? We extend these concepts to how we think about charity as well. What do clever marketing campaigns have to tell us about the integrity and effectiveness of a given charity? Should decisions about how best to help others be purely emotional?</p><p>With our curriculum, students divide their time between guided discussions, interactive online quizzes and videos, lateral thinking, design challenges, group problem-solving, career exploration, and they round out each semester by taking action on behalf of their favorite effective charities.</p><p><i>SHIC provides innovative services to participating schools and students in three primary ways:</i></p><ol>
<li><i>Seeding local clubs. SHIC is committed to building and nourishing an organic network of organizers and member students. We guide our “ambassadors” (member students, teachers and faculty members leading SHIC clubs) in setting up local clubs, and provide attentive guidance and support throughout the entire process.  </i></li>
<li><i>Innovative Curriculum. Available on our website free of charge, our curriculum has been developed and refined by veteran teachers from around the world, who know firsthand what works in the classroom.</i></li>
<li><i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Attentive Guidance and Support. We will always be available to assist ambassadors and participants with anything they might need. The typical turnaround time for all inquiries is less than 24 hours.</span></i></li>
</ol><h3><strong>Impact - Inspiring a new generation of altruists</strong></h3><p>We invest heavily in programs that guide prosocial personal development. While your initial gift is amplified through student fundraising in dollars, our program prioritizes for individual fulfillment and cultivating a lifelong commitment for the least fortunate.</p><p><strong>Here’s how we go about doing this:</strong></p><p>Mutual reinforcement for enhanced STEM education. In light of the undeniable demand for a new generation of students fluent in STEM concepts, and the acknowledgment of that demand by educators around the world, a program that reinforces already existing curricula is critical. Students come to learn about revolutionizing charity and ultimately leave with an enhanced skill set in preparation for university and beyond.</p><p>Activities that research suggests can shape long-term giving potential. Day 1 begins with a Giving Game. According to research conducted by The Life You Can Save, Giving Games carry tremendous potential for influencing future giving behavior.</p><p>The calculated value of student clubs supporting high-impact charities. By inspiring students to make a practical and significant difference, a typical club could bring in $60,000 - $100,000 to high-impact charities.</p><p><strong>Tangible Benefits</strong></p><p>SHIC offers students and schools an opportunity to signal their progress and accomplishments in the real world. Rather than students simply listing themselves as a standard volunteer, SHIC ambassadors can point to leadership, project management, and STEM skills gained from being, for example, a SHIC club Ambassador. These invaluable accomplishments will be on display within our website, which will contain a comprehensive directory of all SHIC Ambassadors and participating schools, including periodic features on particularly impressive achievements of ambassadors and top-rankings of schools according to various metrics.</p><h3><strong>Why SHIC? Why Now?</strong></h3><p>For students that truly do care, little else beyond intuition and word-of-mouth guides them towards volunteer opportunities. Search results can leave students both without a starting point and the overwhelming impression that charity-as-usual is not enough, considering the magnitude of today’s social problems. Any action feels like a drop in the bucket, which means an entire generation could be absent a guide to make effective choices about charity, despite living in the information age. How, then, can we expect the next graduating class to play a vital role at the forefront of world development and global ethics?</p><p>For young do-gooders living in a world where information is cheap, nothing is more valuable than a roadmap on how best to achieve impact. Our novel curriculum and extracurricular clubs provide a crucial channel for students to discover the latest in global development, embrace the global transition toward applying scientific principles to charity, and above all, embark on the most effective ways to take action. Active students in our program will strengthen the tools that they need to become effective changemakers.</p><h3><strong>Highly Skilled Altruists - The Gap in Human Capital</strong></h3><p>Global development entities of all stripes have roundly acknowledged the importance of mathematical and scientific literacy in combatting the most pressing problems of our time. What this means for the next generation is that general demand for STEM skills will be pervasive, and even regarding charity, the head is of equal importance to the heart.</p><p>In addition to the general global demand for STEM skill fluency, top policy-makers now understand that feeling good about giving is no longer the same as actually achieving a better world. Providing evidence and proving effectiveness in helping others is the new gold standard. With this firmly affixed as the ethos of SHIC, valuable technical skills are reflected in the curriculum by learning about what works in helping the least fortunate and what does not.</p><h3><strong>What is High-Impact Charity?</strong></h3><p>Our chosen high-impact charities have been selected and/or highlighted by charity evaluators GiveWell, Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save, or Animal Charity Evaluators as having made demonstrable strides in doing the most good with the money they’re given when compared to other charitable organizations. Throughout the course of our program, students will be introduced to different cause areas and the leading charities working in each field.   </p><p>The charities we currently support:</p><p><br/><a href=""http://www.shicschools.org/#!the-program/izqo1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467330410/edgzivfxe8ltxnwgtix8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p> </p><h3><b>Operations Direction</b></h3><p>SHIC enjoys several advantages relative to typical startups.

The “internal team” consists of those involved with the program at their home institution in some capacity. SHIC “ambassadors” are students who lead the program at their respective schools, while “officers” are students that take an active leadership role in the program after it is introduced by the local ambassador. Proponents of the program who are either teachers or administrators typically initiate the program with the intention of eventually handing it off to an ambassador, or else they have elected to use our curriculum as a core component of their own classes.</p><p> </p><p>The “external team” is composed of SHIC “coordinators” that identify promising potential ambassadors and lobby for clubs to be established. Coordinators will similarly deliver pilots (often at secondary schools) with the intention of inspiring local students to take the program on themselves. The core “central team” is likewise almost entirely composed of volunteers, including the Executive Director, Founding Advisor, Volunteer Programs Manager and volunteer communications and outreach team. The Chief Operations Officer is the only paid full-time staff member of the entire organization, which allows for a supremely lean operating budget.</p><h3><strong>The Team</strong></h3><p>With nearly a decade of international teaching experience between them, co-founders Baxter Bullock and Tee Barnett combine educational experience and insight with their technical knowledge of world development.</p><p>In the fall of 2015, Baxter and Tee were brought onboard Charity Science to stand in for the senior-level staff, who were to leave for India in January to launch Charity Entrepreneurs. Under the guidance and oversight of co-founder Joey Savoie in India and Operations Director David Moss in the UK, Baxter and Tee received a crash course in running a nonprofit by together handling all of the day-to-day operations of Charity Science. In January, the pair decided to pursue SHIC as a side project with the help of Ravi Patel, eventually teaming up with .impact and Charity Science to launch the project in early March.</p><p><strong><i>Founders</i></strong></p><p><i>Executive Director</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467502355/xyybhvauiciqefuhkcsz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Baxter Bullock currently serves as the Programs Director for Charity Science, a foundation focused on researching and implementing the most effective fundraising methods for the most effective charities.

Do students really need it?</strong></p><p>More than our intuitive senses suggest that students around the world want this project to exist. We interpret coordinator and ambassador demand as a proxy for general student demand, and after launching officially in mid-March, this demand has already outstripped our expectations. We originally expected to have half a dozen pilot commitments by mid-May; we’re on course to double that. In addition, we’ve made projections regarding program appeal and potential impact with teachers experienced in delivering similar content, all of which are very encouraging even at conservative estimates. The ease with which SHIC pilot material can be imported and tested around the world ensures that we will have plenty of opportunities to pivot our curriculum and gauge demand. Relative to other organizations, the Charity Science Foundation enjoys a healthy reputation of being incredibly meticulous in evaluating programs, and SHIC expects to import the same level of rigor and self-auditing techniques into our operation.</p><p> </p><p>As for whether students need this club, this certainly constitutes a more prescriptive answer. Global development entities of all stripes, including the United Nations, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Philanthropy Project, have roundly acknowledged the importance of mathematical and scientific literacy in combatting the most pressing problems of our time. What this means for the next generation of givers is that, even regarding charity, the head is equally as important as the heart. Feeling good about giving is no longer the same as actually achieving a better world.</p><p> </p><p>This need for STEM literacy in making real progress is reflected back at our member students during every session and made palpable through learning about what works in helping the least fortunate and what does not. Equipped with the inspiration and know-how to make a substantial prosocial impact, we want to see an entire global network of students with the technical ability to thrive in the real world and the vision to make it a better place for others.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What if students simply don’t like your curriculum? Would that paralyze the entire program? </strong></p><p> </p><p>Absolutely not. We expect the pilot process to expose weaknesses in our content that we can then rework to make it stronger. In fact, that is the primary goal of distributing these six-week pilots to as many schools as we can – tightening the feedback loop and putting out an even better version of our product than the last will only allow us to go from strength to strength.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can we really expect immediate impact to effective charities through high school students? </strong></p><p> </p><p>Without a doubt, but we don’t want to overstate the immediate impact SHIC will have, especially regarding students at such a formative age who are so far from having a regular income. What we will expect to see from every SHIC club is a fundraising effort for their favorite effective charity as the pilot draws to a close, and quarterly fundraising efforts are built into the program for each club thereafter. Those efforts are the bare minimum we’re likely to see in immediate impact and do not include potential spillover effects, including fundraisers taken on independently as well as altered giving habits of parents.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is your primary value added? </strong></p><p> </p><p>Our core message is ultimately what will attract students and schools to SHIC. Everything else, including the attentive staff support, fundraising guidance, online network for students, and school accreditation, revolves around our message.

Every single Level Guide is forged with at least 15 work hours, compiled initially by experts in international development and shaped by teachers with decades of combined classroom experience.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How can the organization remain sustainable despite giving away SHIC’s primary value added? </strong></p><p> </p><p>The trending model for achieving a foothold in the psyche of a potential customer or end user is to give away a fully functional version of a product. In the first year, SHIC does that by allowing full access to our highest quality content, allowing our brand and our message to grow with the students. When the club becomes an integral part of a student’s extracurricular repertoire and an important part of their lives, or teachers similar to our early adopters in Vancouver and New Zealand want to build our curriculum into their actual courses, we will then have made a product of measurable value. After a year of this sort of growth, SHIC will introduce a paywall for premium content, and a small fee for schools interested in integrating our level guides as part of the wider curriculum. This is the point where SHIC turns from a public service, courtesy of our donors, into a social service. SHIC will then be sustained by schools and teachers with the potential to generate additional revenue to be reinvested for the purposes of enhancing SHIC programs.</p><p> </p><p><strong>SHIC has only budgeted for one full-time staff member. How can SHIC produce a substantial enough impact with a single person? </strong></p><p><br/>We’ve calculated that SHIC can oversee well over 100 clubs at any given time before resources become strained with help from a well-organized volunteer core. Currently, about 15 volunteers actively assist operations directly in curriculum design, development, web design and general administration. For example, each level guide requires roughly 20 hours of manpower, including input from EA teachers that have decades of combined experience. When added to the number of SHIC coordinators and ambassadors, by the start of the new school year SHIC will have built a network of over 50 committed volunteers. The drive and dedication of our EA volunteer core is absolutely crucial to our organizational effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Thank you to our special partners</strong></p><p>SHIC was fortunate enough to have several operational costs covered and also received technical and financial expertise from .impact, a movement-building organization that also operates under the umbrella of the Charity Science Foundation.</p><p>Because the SHIC co-founders are fronting the funds for the initial launch, and thanks to the incredibly active and collaborative effective altruism network, SHIC has made considerable strides in bringing our program to students around the world. The success of Charity Science in ushering other non-profits away from ineffective fundraising practices has translated into considerable support from like-minded charitable organizations. For example, SHIC received $5,000 USD of in-kind funding from The Life You Can Save to conduct Giving Games–an activity that give students a decision-making framework for choosing which charity to support with real money.</p></div>","Thanks for dropping by the Students For High-Impact Charity (SHIC) Indigogo campaign! We want you to make an impact investment in order to help achieve our ultimate goal: Building a global network of students with the technical ability to thrive in the real world and the vision to make it a better place.  We do this by providing any student, anywhere in the world a global network of classes and extracurricular clubs dedicated to achieving the most substantial prosocial impact.Our program pays special attention to how science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) all play a crucial role in the future of international development. We envision a new class of socially conscious leaders with a lifelong commitment to doing the most good possible.                                                                                                                                                     We need your help to complete the first round of program launches for the new school year through December 2016. We would otherwise not be able to deliver programs beyond August to students around the world who can't wait to start learning how best to make a difference. Every little bit nudges us toward our vision!                                                                                                                                                    You can spark a force multiplier for impact.Part-in-parcel with shaping long-term personal development is inspiring students to truly feel themselves making an impact in the here and now. SHIC supporters not only nudge students towards a healthier future, but your initial gift sets off a chain reaction in real dollars as more and more SHIC students plan quarterly fundraising activities for their favorite high-impact charities. 100% of these student-raised proceeds go directly to charity, not to us.Why only do a single good deed when you can initiate cascading positive impact? Here’s how it works:(click here or on the image for a closer look) We see your contribution as an impact investment because concern for others is truly a compounding phenomenon. Students who value charity are far more likely to make it an integral part of their lives later on. To break it down even further, a student persuaded by our program to donate just 1% of their income for an entire lifetime could result in tens of thousands of dollars donated to worthwhile causes.Catherine’s Class - New ZealandCatherine is an educator in New Zealand and also one of our most dedicated volunteers. She found SHIC materials so appealing that she integrated them into her year 13 core curriculum. After finishing our 6-week pilot, her class raised $675 NZD for high-impact charities!Half of the class elected to run a Cool Earth peer-to-peer fundraiser, and the other half a vegan sausage sizzle and video screening for our top-ranked animal welfare charities. On top of that, her students will also run a Giving Game assembly for over 100 students to help promote high-impact giving!“I now realise even more that it is everyone's, including mine, responsibility to help the world in whatever most effective way we can. I'll remember the things I have learnt in this course and it may influence what I choose to study and what career I head into in the future.”- Kimberley, student participant, New ZealandWhat we’re really about: personal growth in rethinking charityOur ultimate goal is to ignite the ambition of young altruists and extend a refined skill set into all areas of their personal development. Rethinking charity is the vehicle through which students hone valuable meta-skills for personal development. Our novel curriculum complements the latest approaches to doing good with concepts of logic, epistemology, and metacognition, which carry practical applications in everyday life.For example, what is a cognitive bias? How do they keep us from helping others most effectively? How can we keep these biases from affecting our own personal decisions? We extend these concepts to how we think about charity as well. What do clever marketing campaigns have to tell us about the integrity and effectiveness of a given charity? Should decisions about how best to help others be purely emotional?With our curriculum, students divide their time between guided discussions, interactive online quizzes and videos, lateral thinking, design challenges, group problem-solving, career exploration, and they round out each semester by taking action on behalf of their favorite effective charities.SHIC provides innovative services to participating schools and students in three primary ways:
Seeding local clubs. SHIC is committed to building and nourishing an organic network of organizers and member students. We guide our “ambassadors” (member students, teachers and faculty members leading SHIC clubs) in setting up local clubs, and provide attentive guidance and support throughout the entire process.  
Innovative Curriculum. Available on our website free of charge, our curriculum has been developed and refined by veteran teachers from around the world, who know firsthand what works in the classroom.
Attentive Guidance and Support. We will always be available to assist ambassadors and participants with anything they might need. The typical turnaround time for all inquiries is less than 24 hours.
Impact - Inspiring a new generation of altruistsWe invest heavily in programs that guide prosocial personal development. While your initial gift is amplified through student fundraising in dollars, our program prioritizes for individual fulfillment and cultivating a lifelong commitment for the least fortunate.Here’s how we go about doing this:Mutual reinforcement for enhanced STEM education. In light of the undeniable demand for a new generation of students fluent in STEM concepts, and the acknowledgment of that demand by educators around the world, a program that reinforces already existing curricula is critical. Students come to learn about revolutionizing charity and ultimately leave with an enhanced skill set in preparation for university and beyond.Activities that research suggests can shape long-term giving potential. Day 1 begins with a Giving Game. According to research conducted by The Life You Can Save, Giving Games carry tremendous potential for influencing future giving behavior.The calculated value of student clubs supporting high-impact charities. By inspiring students to make a practical and significant difference, a typical club could bring in $60,000 - $100,000 to high-impact charities.Tangible BenefitsSHIC offers students and schools an opportunity to signal their progress and accomplishments in the real world. Rather than students simply listing themselves as a standard volunteer, SHIC ambassadors can point to leadership, project management, and STEM skills gained from being, for example, a SHIC club Ambassador. These invaluable accomplishments will be on display within our website, which will contain a comprehensive directory of all SHIC Ambassadors and participating schools, including periodic features on particularly impressive achievements of ambassadors and top-rankings of schools according to various metrics.Why SHIC? Why Now?For students that truly do care, little else beyond intuition and word-of-mouth guides them towards volunteer opportunities. Search results can leave students both without a starting point and the overwhelming impression that charity-as-usual is not enough, considering the magnitude of today’s social problems. Any action feels like a drop in the bucket, which means an entire generation could be absent a guide to make effective choices about charity, despite living in the information age. How, then, can we expect the next graduating class to play a vital role at the forefront of world development and global ethics?For young do-gooders living in a world where information is cheap, nothing is more valuable than a roadmap on how best to achieve impact. Our novel curriculum and extracurricular clubs provide a crucial channel for students to discover the latest in global development, embrace the global transition toward applying scientific principles to charity, and above all, embark on the most effective ways to take action. Active students in our program will strengthen the tools that they need to become effective changemakers.Highly Skilled Altruists - The Gap in Human CapitalGlobal development entities of all stripes have roundly acknowledged the importance of mathematical and scientific literacy in combatting the most pressing problems of our time. What this means for the next generation is that general demand for STEM skills will be pervasive, and even regarding charity, the head is of equal importance to the heart.In addition to the general global demand for STEM skill fluency, top policy-makers now understand that feeling good about giving is no longer the same as actually achieving a better world. Providing evidence and proving effectiveness in helping others is the new gold standard. With this firmly affixed as the ethos of SHIC, valuable technical skills are reflected in the curriculum by learning about what works in helping the least fortunate and what does not.What is High-Impact Charity?Our chosen high-impact charities have been selected and/or highlighted by charity evaluators GiveWell, Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save, or Animal Charity Evaluators as having made demonstrable strides in doing the most good with the money they’re given when compared to other charitable organizations. Throughout the course of our program, students will be introduced to different cause areas and the leading charities working in each field.   The charities we currently support: Operations DirectionSHIC enjoys several advantages relative to typical startups. Most notably, your impact investments will be tax deductible in the US and Canada since we've launched as an independent .impact initiative under the foundational umbrella of Charity Science. Moving forward, we know that our supporters care about being a part of a sustainable initiative. SHIC plans to pivot to a social venture model by generating revenue in various ways. We’ve projected that support via school donations and school accreditation will constitute a sizeable share of our operating budget, allowing serious altruists like yourself to pursue other worthwhile projects.You can find our full funding proposal hereOther Ways to Contribute- To make donations without the 5% platform fees of Indiegogo, please click here for our Generosity.com campaign- For Tax-deductible donations in the US and Canada, please visit our website or contact Tee at tee@highimpacstudents.orgWhat you GetWe made it a top priority of ours to offer perks that mirror our mission and further foster a sense of connectedness with our supporters. We take pride in demonstrating how every dollar will go directly towards strengthening our global network of students making significant strides in their personal development and taking action on behalf of high-impact charities.Our impact investors will have a direct line to our team and the latest news coming out of the SHIC program, including a standing invitation to join our Slack community (an instant messaging platform) to see the inner workings of SHIC, and access to our Facebook group our monthly newsletter dedicated exclusively to informing our supporters about the progress we’ve made together. More involved impact investors also receive t-shirts, so you can kick off a conversation anywhere you go about the importance of guiding the next generation of altruists.What people are saying“I can't thank you enough Tee and Baxter. The organized, reproducible lesson plans and the SHIC brand are exactly what [] student groups need.- Aahan Rashid, student coordinator, Indiana, USA""My experience with the first few levels was overwhelmingly positive...Another great thing about the topics of these lessons is that they immediately capture the attention and interest of the students. The topics come across as both unusual in a school context and extremely relevant and contemporary.""- Roland Reichart, student coordinator, Austria, Vienna “The majority of the students seemed interested in the talk and I could see that the discussions were lively.”- Radim, student coordinator, Brno, Czech Republic “I know Tee and Baxter well - we’ve worked out of the same Vancouver EA office for a long time - and unreservedly recommend them as a team...I’m very excited to throw the support of .impact behind this project.”- Tom Ash, .impact Executive Director, Vancouver, CanadaCurrent Supporters

Figure does not include bootstrap funding by Baxter and Tee at launchSHIC Organizational StructureSHIC relies on an expansive and dedicated network of volunteers that is instrumental to our operations. The “internal team” consists of those involved with the program at their home institution in some capacity. SHIC “ambassadors” are students who lead the program at their respective schools, while “officers” are students that take an active leadership role in the program after it is introduced by the local ambassador. Proponents of the program who are either teachers or administrators typically initiate the program with the intention of eventually handing it off to an ambassador, or else they have elected to use our curriculum as a core component of their own classes. The “external team” is composed of SHIC “coordinators” that identify promising potential ambassadors and lobby for clubs to be established. Coordinators will similarly deliver pilots (often at secondary schools) with the intention of inspiring local students to take the program on themselves. The core “central team” is likewise almost entirely composed of volunteers, including the Executive Director, Founding Advisor, Volunteer Programs Manager and volunteer communications and outreach team. The Chief Operations Officer is the only paid full-time staff member of the entire organization, which allows for a supremely lean operating budget.The TeamWith nearly a decade of international teaching experience between them, co-founders Baxter Bullock and Tee Barnett combine educational experience and insight with their technical knowledge of world development.In the fall of 2015, Baxter and Tee were brought onboard Charity Science to stand in for the senior-level staff, who were to leave for India in January to launch Charity Entrepreneurs. Under the guidance and oversight of co-founder Joey Savoie in India and Operations Director David Moss in the UK, Baxter and Tee received a crash course in running a nonprofit by together handling all of the day-to-day operations of Charity Science. In January, the pair decided to pursue SHIC as a side project with the help of Ravi Patel, eventually teaming up with .impact and Charity Science to launch the project in early March.FoundersExecutive DirectorBaxter Bullock currently serves as the Programs Director for Charity Science, a foundation focused on researching and implementing the most effective fundraising methods for the most effective charities. Before moving to Vancouver in October 2015, Baxter interned with the Centre for Effective Altruism in Oxford, UK.

<p>How the 10th Annual Black365 Knowledge Bowl Came to Be...</p>
<p>Growing up I thought that African Americans were destined to be one, or all of the following: athletes, drug dealers, gang members or entertainers.  </p>
<p>At the age of 14 I underwent heart surgery, which ended my dreams of ever becoming a basketball star. With more time on my hands, because I was no longer practicing, I began to pick up books on Black history. For the first time, I saw myself reflected on the pages of world history. I discovered that Black people were more than just athletes, drug dealers, gang members, and entertainers - but architects, engineers, astronauts and more.</p>
<p>Inspired by this information, I became my high school's first-ever African American valedictorian, was accepted to eight universities and received approximately $50,000 in scholarships!</p>
<p>The Black365 Knowledge Bowl was created with the intention of being the SPARK that sparks the mind of tomorrow's great leaders! During the Black365 Knowledge Bowl teams of young people challenge one another, and themselves, as they answer 101 questions in world history. This is a jeopardy-style quiz competition, that is fast-paced and rewarding for both the young people and the audience...with a positive lasting impact for everyone involved.</p>
<p><br/>What We Need</p>
<p>Every participant walks away with scholarship money and prizes:</p>
<p>First place: $250 (for all four team members) = $1,000</p>
<p>Second place: $150 (for all four team members) = $600</p>
<p>Third place: $75 (for all four team members) = $300</p>
<p>Fourth place: $25 (for all four team members) = 100</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The above scholarship amounts also come with:</p>
<p>Certificates of Participation</p>
<p>Books to continue their studies</p>
<p>Inspirational posters and other works of art</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There you have it, $2,750 in the hands of the deserving college-bound high school students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What Do You Get?</p>
<p>For your contributions, you will receive the satisfaction of knowing you assisted in the ascension of a young person’s life academically and socially! </p>
<p>Also, depending on the level of support, you will have your name, or your organization’s name recognized in the official program booklet. </p>
<p>You will receive a photograph of the 2020 Participants and an autographed Black365 Calendar, which is the basis for the Black365 Knowledge Bowl.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can attend the 9th Annual Black365 Knowledge Bowl and promote your business with banners, decorations, give-a-ways, goodie bags... and more. An event program will be mailed to you.</p>

<p>Building Understanding through International Learning and Development (BUILD) is an interdisciplinary student-led program of the Institute for Global Leadership at Tufts University. BUILD seeks to educate and immerse students in the theory and practice of sustainable development by partnering with rural communities in the developing world to research and implement sustainable initiatives for human, social, and economic development.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT BUILD:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>BUILD is a student-led sustainable development program guided by the four pillars of education, action, solidarity, and leadership, each serving a crucial and complementary role as we work directly with rural communities in the developing world for the general improvement of their economic, social, and infrastructural condition. BUILD conducts powerful and innovative development work that operates in four stages: research, planning, execution, and analysis.</p>
<p>BUILD’s community partnerships are highly independent, long-term, and comprehensive, transforming the student learning experience from the purely analytical to the fully participatory. As one student said, ""We impact real peoples’ lives; the stakes are too high for failure."" Statements such as this have prompted BUILD to assure full community participation and deep human investment in all of our projects. The research, planning, execution, and analysis are shared activities, linking and blending the motivations and goals of the Program’s students and the members of our partner communities, for the their mutual benefit.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM PILLARS:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Education: </em></strong>BUILD educates students about sustainable development, which we define as a process combining economics, anthropology, political science, and principles of social and environmental justice. Students involved in the program attend weekly meetings to discuss competing theories of economic development as well as the various political, social, and economic issues our partner communities may face given their history, geography, culture, and economy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action: </em></strong>BUILD fosters direct interaction between Tufts students and those living in developing communities in order to give students the opportunity to act in the sustainable development process with the ultimate goal of collaboratively implementing sustainable solutions to expressed needs. As interaction depends, BUILD is able to form a Community Development Plan (CDP) written conjointly by BUILD students and community leaders.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solidarity: </em></strong>Direct interaction and collaboration with partner communities produces a crucial sense of solidarity between students and communities. BUILD students spend substantial time with families and youth conducting personal interviews in order to assess local needs on an individual basis. The sense of solidarity cultivated during all stages of the projects is fundamental to BUILD’s effectiveness and to ensuring the longevity of our community partnerships.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leadership: </em></strong>Research and project management enable BUILD students to develop their leadership abilities in a context similar to that of a small development NGO. Grant writing, logistical planning, fundraising, budget formation, and outreach to local NGOs are just a few of the responsibilities of BUILD students, and this practical experience equips students with valuable skills while at the same time providing tangible, innovative development solutions to our partner communities.</p>
<p><strong>PAST PARTNERSHIPS AND PROJECTS:</strong></p>
<p>In Guatemala, BUILD partnered with the community, Santa Anita la Unión, an organic coffee cooperative located in the fertile Quetzaltenango province. Most of the men of the cooperative, and a number of the women, fought against the government with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) from the 1970s to 1990s, and in 1996 this group of combatants handed in their weapons in exchange for the then-abandoned farm. BUILD worked with Santa Anita to implement numerous projects in agriculture, technology, and eco-tourism.</p>
<p>In India BUILD partnered with Thottiapatti, a partner village of 70 households in the Perambalur district of rural Tamil Nadu, India, is a community of individuals with a rich cultural and religious heritage. Thottiapatti lacks access to immediate transportation, toilets, consistent power supply, and medical care. Reflecting the national trend, there have been multiple recent suicides within the village that have torn families apart—leaving an overarching feeling of desolation. In Thottiapattia BUILD has worked to implement projects in public health, technology, and energy.</p>

It aims to strengthen a growing global network of 'subtle activists' committed to developing internal peace as a foundation for a global culture of peace.

pay for a video editor to create our BeThePeace video documentary, to be broadcast on PeaceDay TV on September 23
develop resources to help catapult the whole field of global meditation to a new level of cohesion and collaboration.
recover our costs for running this event, including the costs of creating the website, flyer, promo video, logo, and other marketing materials.
enable us to convene bigger and better events in the future!

What You'll Get

the chance to help co-create one of the largest global prayer and meditation events in history
a profound experience of global peace
an invitation to a private Global Attunement meditation telecast 
all the various perks listed to the right



Who We Are
The hosts of BeThePeace are the leaders of two emerging global peace organizations.
Patrick Kronfli is the director and co-founder of MedMob, which convenes monthly public flash meditation gatherings in over 380 cities worldwide.
David Nicol is the director and co-founder of the Gaiafield Project, that aims to co-create a global network of 'subtle activists' for social and global transformation.
Patrick and David are supported by a large design team, including:

Gaiafield Council members David Todd, Bonnie Bell, Leslie Meehan, Avon Mattison, Myra Jackson, Claudia Welss, Lynda Terry, and Sean Kelly;  
Prayerformance poet and artist Jody Levy
Social media maven and subtle activist Catherine Douglas

BeThePeace has been developed in close partnership with:


Pathways to Peace and the Culture of Peace Initiative, especially through Pathways to Peace founder Avon Mattison, one of the primary moving forces behind the International Day of Peace
The Institute of HeartMath and its Global Coherence Initiative, especially through Brian Kabaker and Claudia Welss

The Shift Network's Summer of Peace program, especially through Philip Hellmich.

Global Significance
We're passionate about the power of global meditation and prayer to inspire the collective imagination of humanity about what's possible on this planet when we come together as One. We believe that creating experiences of profound global communion can help to infuse love, compassion, and joy to the planet, helping us to heal our collective wounds and inspiring us to co-create a global wisdom civilization.
This event, co-designed and co-promoted by many leading organizations in the field, aims to be a model for collaborative global meditations, bringing the whole field forward to a new degree of visibility and cooperation.

If you have an idea, would like to join the SKATEDUCATE movement or want to donate something that is not money? Contact us on info@skateducate.comWe love all of our contributors!! All donations, big or small, are helping us accomplish our goal. We want to make sure that the girls have to pay as little as possible to be on the camp, and every contribution is a step on the way making this dream come true. THANK YOU GUYS! And by the way - everyone who donates to SKATEDUCATE via Indiegogo gets an email with news and thoughts from our firs SKATEDUCATE camp in Aarhus, Denmark. 
Get to know us better - visit our webpage: skateducate.comUpdate: We've got 2 snowskates, 10 Roces helmets and 10 Roces safety equipment sets from Skatepro! Thank you Skatepro - you guys rock! Anne went to Greenland to visit Sisimiut, where we are making a camp in the summer. Watch the cool girls in Sisimiut try snowskates for the very first time!",11.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>The
Migrant and Refugee Communities Forum was established in 1993 in response to
the needs of migrant and refugee communities in North West London. Settled
economic migrants as well as newly arrived refugees struggled in their attempts
to access health and welfare services, employment and education, legal advice,
and housing. They formed community organisations to share their knowledge and
skills and to support each other.</p>
<p>We were
created as a trusted intermediary for shared infrastructure support that
would sustain their on-the-ground work with specific communities. We were
conceived and are still governed by representatives of migrant and refugee
communities. We continue to proudly serve and advocate for the issues these
migrant groups face in London and the UK.</p>
<p><b>What We Do </b></p>
<p>-
Community Organising</p>
<p>-
Leadership Development </p>
<p>-
Non-formal &amp; Alternative Education</p>
<p>-
Mentoring</p>
<p>-
Research &amp; Policy</p>
<p>-
Advocacy &amp; Campaigning </p>
<p><b>The New Beginnings Mentoring Project </b></p>
<p>Mentoring
is our tool for combating isolation and loneliness. We use it to
empower individuals and communities to tackle and overcome the hardships they
encounter as migrants and refugees in London. We use it to impart skills and
knowledge that will bring migrant communities forward and that improve social and
mental wellbeing. We use it to build the capacity of people and groups so that
they themselves can become active multipliers of change. </p>
<p>Besides
offering one-on-one mentoring matches between trained individuals and refugees
in need, the New Beginnings Project has grown around a core of services and
activities that support refugees, migrants and asylum seekers who are
isolated or need extra support to build confidence, access services and develop
new abilities so that they can build happier lives in London. </p>
<p>These
activities include:</p>
<p>- English and Mathematics classes</p>
<p>- Social
theatre workshops</p>
<p>-
Knitting and sewing classes</p>
<p>- Digital
drop-in classes</p>
<p>- Support groups for women, men and young people</p>
<p>-
Cultural Fridays</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need
your help to keep creating New Beginnings for our people and their communities!
The £5,000 we are raising is going towards our non-formal and alternative
education activities budget, especially the Cultural Fridays.</p>
<p>These
Cultural Fridays are weekly get-togethers comprising a portfolio of cultural
and arts and craft skills workshops that strengthen the mental and physical
wellbeing of our beneficiaries, many of which suffer from post-traumatic stress
disorder. </p>
<p>We
usually have 15 attendees at a time and we run 40 such events yearly, meaning
that we have the potential to reach up to 600 individuals alone just through
this aspect of our work. Every session costs us £150 and includes craft
materials, refreshments, travel expenses and snacks for the attendees. We need to raise a total
of £5,500 to be able to continue our Cultural Fridays this year. We have
already raised £500 from our supporters and need your help to cover the
rest.</p>
<p>In return
for your generous support we are offering you the fruits of our work - our
refugees will show you their appreciation and respect by
sending you the items they have created during these Cultural Fridays.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Focusing
on the mental wellbeing of refugees and engaging them in
holistic activities that stimulate the mind and the body, helping them to be
creative and innovative is essential for their integration and participation in
society. </p>
<p>Our New
