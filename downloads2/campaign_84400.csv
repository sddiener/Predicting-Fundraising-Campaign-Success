</div>The Story
</h3>
<div>8 years ago I composed music to a film about Bertrand Piccard, the pioneer that flew around the world in a balloon and announced the Solar airplane. Since then I knew I wanted to contribute to this great idea of promoting clean energy. With joint efforts we can develop the technology that makes us more independent from fossil power. With the technology used in the solar airplane we could divide by two the use of fossil energy. So why isn't it done? </div>
<div>I want to help the only way I know how, by composing and producing music that will carry the idea and spread it as far as possible.</div>
<div>I am a composer based in Switzerland. My work includes some compositions for acclaimed Swiss TV Documentaries and Series. My partner in this endeavor is Steve Sidwell who just won a Grammy! He conducts the SoundFX Choir, that does incredible Sounds only using their voices. <br/>

I was raised on Old School, RnB and Hip Hop music. The sounds of old school music flooded my house on a daily basis. My mom and aunt would do the hustle in our living room. There was an instant relationship and love created with music.  My cousin and I used to “pre-tape”, create our own “DJ Mix” versions of hip-hop songs on a double cassette boom box.  Growing up with music was always my way to deal with life. My way to escape into a world full of beats, rhymes, and rhythms.”I began my own musical journey eight years ago - producing music and working with various like-minded indie artists who share a common goal of putting good music back onto the airwaves. Producing Overdose, (link to song samples) the R&B compilation album I’ve been working on for the past year, is one of the ways I hope to do this. But your help is needed to bring it to life.Overdose, a ten-song compilation, will be the first of several projects, and features artists from across the U.S., including San Diego, Houston, St. Louis, New York and Montreal. Two other projects are in the works. Music isn’t only about a great beat, but full fledge projects. Overdose is my opportunity to not only showcase my production skills, but to add value and increase exposure for the members of We Create Music, a community of more than 7,000 members that I founded last year to promote and connect music creators worldwide. Album BudgetHere is a projected budget to give you an idea of how funds will be allocated.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello and much love from all of us at Ugoplatinum and welcome to our app development fundraising campaign! First and foremost, we at Ugoplatinum recognize that social media accounts for lion's share of time spent on mobile devices*; with that said, we understand the level of necessity having a mobile app these days. Ugoplatinum was made for artists by artists, artists like you or someone you know.</p>
<p>Ugoplatinum will always put music first because we’re more than a business - we’re a movement! We strive to give musicians a serious chance at success by equipping them with the tools that will afford them the opportunity to take their careers in their own hands.</p>
<p>Through Ugoplatinum, musicians gain the exposure they deserve, in turn giving them the choice to advance their career in the direction they choose. With your contribution, you will be giving musicians around the world the opportunity to make their dreams a reality! Our dream is that musicians will seize this opportunity and pursue their dreams to places they never expected. We at Ugoplatinum will encourage them to press on even after those dreams are realized!</p>
<p>We hope you will join our movement and contribute, and know we are going to change the world together! Thank You from all of us at Ugoplatinum and much love!</p>
<p><i>*There are currently more people regularly using mobile devices (tablets and smart phones) than laptops or desktop computers; apps account for 89% of mobile media time, with the other 11% spent on websites (SmartInsights.com).</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Based on the proposals and quotes we've received from various app developers, building the Ugoplatinum app is going to cost between $20,000 - $30,000. This will be going to the app developers for the framework, design, and work hours it will take them to build our app.</p>
<p>We are offering perks for those who help to fund the app. </p>
<p>Everyone who donates will be included on Ugoplatinum.com's permanent Wall of Fame as those who helped to build Ugoplatinum. This will include you photo (if you wish), Your Name, location, and, if you like, even a link to something near and dear to your heart - like your own business, perhaps.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates $20 will receive a free song from any Member Artist on Ugoplatinum.com. </p>
<p>Anyone who donates $50 will receive five (5) free songs from any Member Artists on Ugoplatinum.com. </p>
<p>Anyone who donates $100 will receive ten (10) free songs from any Member Artists on Ugoplatinum.com. </p>
<p>And anyone who donates $500 or more will be entered in a drawing to receive a $78,000 Patek Philippe Nautilus Custom Diamond Men’s Watch. We're giving away one to each of the first five Artists to 'Go Platinum' (sell 1,000,000 individual songs) - and you can be in the running to receive Watch Number six! <a href=""https://ugoplatinum.com/patek-philippe-watch-1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>(Click here for details)</i></a></p>
<p>In the event that we do not reach our entire goal, proceeds will be put toward the app development anyway; we are determined to get this done and will simply use conventional means (loans, investors, revenue) to make up the difference.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You may be familiar with the saying ""Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime."" Instead of donating money to various charities (which can indeed be helpful), your donation will help us to ""teach musicians"" in underdeveloped nations ""how to fish."" It is a fact that the funds generated by people in communities anywhere (as opposed to direct charitable donations) proliferates, since they wind up spending, investing, or contributing in their own communities, as opposed to charitable organizations, which have overhead, and often provide only staples.</p>
<p>Bringing ""garage bands"" in underdeveloped nations into the Ugoplatinum fold will help to accomplish what many traditional charitable organizations cannot.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Since Ugoplatinum was founded by Beat producer <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/phoolishsounds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phoolish Sounds</a>, his dad and a family friend - just regular working folks - all of the risk to date has been ours. However, Ugoplatinum has over 25 years of business experience in that mix, with all of its primary participants being musicians and people who know the music business. One of Ugoplatinum's founders has even had close personal and/or working ties to rock legends like Rick Derringer, Santana, and Journey! </p>
<p>Being ""regular"" people who started Ugoplatinum out of a love for music and a desire to give back, of course we've been working ""on a shoestring,"" building the company out of our own savings and income. Until we get some real revenue flowing (through customer purchases), this will continue to be the case.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the video, since so many more people are on mobile devices than computers and use apps rather than websites these days, we can't reasonably expect things to pick up as fast as they should until we get that app built.   </p>
<p>And as the video said, <i>that's where you come in!</i></p>

<p>Short Summary</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mo Javi is a classically trained and mostly self taught violinist who has been playing for 14 years. He specializes in Classical, Folk, and Blues, and can read music, write music, play by ear, and improvise. He has coined his original style as ""Baroque Folk,"" combining influences from Bach, Mozart, Celtic, and American folk music. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Royal Wedding is Mo Javi's very first Album, and he wants your help in bringing it to its fullest potential. If we can raise $1000, that will cover studio recording, mixing, and mastering expenses for the entire Album. As a result, it will be released FOR FREE. If the people make it, it's the people's. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you donate a substantial contribution of $10 or more (1% of the campaign goal), you will not only get to be awesome, but you will also get early access to Mo Javi's very first collaborative track, ""Don't Cry,"" a R&amp;B/Rock single due for release in December (but YOU get to hear it as soon as it's release ready)!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please listen to Royal Wedding and support this campaign if you believe in the potential of this Album. If anything, please leave feedback (if you liked it or hated it), share it with your friends, and check out all of Mo Javi's other projects by visiting MoJaviMusic.com or just googling his name, ""Mo Javi.""</p>

<p>As fangirls, we love seeing merch inspired by our favorite bands. Music is everything to us and we love the community that being in a fandom provides. We've seen so many amazing music inspired items and artwork that we wanted to provide a place to showcase them. So, we created The Bandom Box. The Bandom Box is a monthly subscription service that brings you unique and fun fan made merch items. You, as a subscriber, will be able to opt in or out for each month after the artist of the month is revealed.</p>
<p>To start the road trip to The Bandom Box, we need to raise money to begin manufacturing the items for the boxes. We are looking to raise $2,500 by selling 100 boxes. All of the money from this campaign will go directly to the first batch of orders and towards securing our LLC to be able to sell online.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, all the funds will go back to you, the investor.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is C.j. Harris and I'm a music producer from Birmingham, AL. I've been making music for over 10 years now. I've sold beats to many independent artists through my website (KingshipMusic.com) and recently gotten into Music Licensing for TV shows. Currently I have 3 publishing deals with companies out of Atlanta and LA. My music has been placed on shows like Bad Girls Club, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Basketball Wives LA, and more. Although I've been blessed to have my music featured on these shows, the residual income hasn't been enough for me to handle all of the expenses to keep my career going and not nearly enough for me to live on. I still work a 9-5 job just like most people.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the only equipment I have ever used to make music is an HP desktop computer (along with music production software) and an old Radio Shack keyboard. Well this past December my computer quit working and I haven't made any music since. This year I plan to jump-start my career as a music producer and entrepreneur by starting my own music production company (Kingship Music, LLC) as well as connecting with more publishers. But just like any other business, you need capital in order to start. That's where you guys come in...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Capital</h3>
<p>In order to successfully launch my company I'll need money for studio equipment &amp; furniture, music production software, online promotion, state registration of my business name, taxes, copyright fees, and membership fees for the music organizations that I have to join. My goal is to raise $10,000 to cover all expenses and any unexpected things that could possibly come up. No donation is too small, no donation is too big. Any amount that you'd like to give will help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>I am excited to be offering some cool perks for this campaign. I will be offering packages that include Exclusive Rights and Non-Exclusive Rights for instrumentals in multiple genres, Limited Edition T-shirts, and Beat Collaborations with a chance at landing a publishing deal. </p>
<p>At the end of the campaign I will be creating a gratitude board that will hang on the wall of my studio with the names of each and every person who donated. It will serve as a constant reminder of the good people who contributed to making my dream become a reality. I will be forever grateful to you all.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute right now, that's OK! Please share it with anyone who may be able to help out! The more people that hear about it, the bigger chance to get it funded. Check out all of the great perks and preview my beat catalog at (KingshipMusic.com) Thanks so much!</p>

<h3>Hello! </h3>
<p>Help us raise money to release our self-titled EP Mischievous Minx! This started as truly a passion project in the winter of 2016 between John Petrucelli and Anastasia Hagermann. Our writing sessions churned out the handful of songs included on the EP. We recorded them this past June and have spent the last 5 months perfecting the tunes for your listening pleasure. By the end of the year we are hoping to raise $6,000 to cover the costs of recording, mixing, mastering, and releasing the EP. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>It means so much to everyone involved in the production that you are a supporter of new compositions by local musicians. Your contributions will go <u>directly</u> towards all the expenses involved with the making, promoting and releasing Mischievous Minx. This includes paying our recording artists, sound engineers and graphic designer. Then the funds received will pay for creating the hard copies of the EP and some super cool merchandise for our fans. Lastly, the remaining money will pay for the costs associated with promoting the cd and the EP release show on December 3rd at Cattivo in Pittsburgh.  </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>You get our eternal gratitude and thanks for helping our music live! In all seriousness though, we listed a ton of cool merch, behind the scenes inspiration and physical copies of the EP as just some of the perks you get for supporting our passion for creating music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is the reflection of the unique blend of pop, jazz and r&amp;b we've been developing over the past year. We think that our band will successfully connect with audiences across genres and serve as a way to get amazing musicians involved from rock, jazz, funk and even classical music as we continue to develop. We have a successful track record of projects, including albums such as ""The Way"" and ""Presence"" by John Petrucelli, and have contributed to dozens of bands and records over the past 5 years. We've also made sure to finish recording the album before asking for your contribution so that we can guarantee delivery of these fresh tunes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Putting a new band together is difficult- we're working with amazing musicians, a videographer, graphic designer and many others behind the scenes to get our music out there! Fortunately, Anastasia and John are both experienced musicians who have traveled the world and recorded before. We have finished the album but need your help to push us over the top!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about your campaign!</li>
<li>Please share our campaign with people you think might be interested in what we're doing!</li>

<p><strong>WHO IS GULLIESON?</strong></p>
<p>I am an inspiring musician located in Pittsburgh, PA.  My musical journey started at the age of 14, it is has been the most effective way to express my thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p> Two years ago,  I've started an independent label with two of my siblings, our mission is to reintroduce creativity, authenticity, and conscious raising musical content. Last year our team successfully gain a larger fan base, through our latest media marketing strategies, the response has been amazing!  Since, our recent media break through I am now able to meet and form new relationships with fans worldwide. My fan base population continues to grow at a constant pace, showing an increase of digital streams, merchandise purchases, youtube and website subscriptions.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with my work and  just getting to know me, I invite you all to check out my music videos as the link is listed below. As you guys take the time to watch my videos, you will notice that every video entails a creative concept. This is done to help bring my lyrics alive, so to speak; creating a more vivid image. I am deeply passionate about about the music I produce, which is why I dedicate a significant amount of time and energy into each project. </p>

<h1>Why I Need You Guys:</h1>
<p>My team and myself have independently financed my musical campaign, though we have gained amazing feedback, we do not have the equability to sustain longevity within the music industry, which is our goal. Utilizing this platform will allow me to gain new supporters, who believe in my talent and wish to aid in my success.</p>
<p>50 songs and 6 videos later I'm realizing with my current team we do not have the money to meet the demands of my fan/supports. In addition to that I'm currently looking to quit my full time job so I can truly pursue this life long dream of mine.  I know there is no way in the world I can truly get to where I want to be in life working a job that takes up most of my time and energy.</p>
<p>The good news is I’ve been able to get some impressive data from my trial runs, which gives me a good indication on the demand for my content.  Me and my team have been able to generate this with a small budget of about 2,000, imagine what we can do if we can reached our crowd funding goal!</p>
<p>Seeing the reactions of others responding to my content is mined blowing!  Knowing that my hard work and efforts are appreciated and respected is rejuvenating and further motivates me to continue pursing my dreams, no matter the adversity that I may encounter.</p>
<p>To give you an Idea of the cost of Production here is a break down of where the funds will be going</p>
<p><strong>Recording</strong></p>
<p>I've already began the recording process but to fully get things completed It will cost around $2000.  This total includes recording, artist collaborations, engineer mixing, production and mastering.  In order to be taken serious in the entertainment industry , it is vital that your content not only be  good but your overall track quality be on a professional level.  So in order to achieve this I will be would like to work with some of the best within that budget.</p>
<p><strong>Videos</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Budget 5000</strong></i></p>
<p>Todays society is very image/ video driven due to the social Media platforms  of today such as Youtube, Instagram, and Facebook etc.  So to keep the content not only flowing but entertaining  I want to provide some dynamic Atypical videos.   In the past I've haven't had the budget to fully bring my Ideas to life, I want to make some of the most mind-blowing and  impactful videos of 2018, to do this it will require better videographers as well as money for accessories for the videos (cars, models etc).  My goal is to give you at minimum 5-6 amazing fan picked videos from off this project.   </p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Budget 6000</strong></i></p>
<p>Last but not least is the marketing process, which can be so complex and expensive however it is very crucial to creating awareness and  expanding your fanbase.  I will be utilizing services such as Youtube Ads, Facebook ads, Streaming ad platforms and any other valuable platforms not listed to get the maximum exposure to TARGETED FANS. I will be pushing the project as a whole but the majority of the marketing will be going towards specific songs (topped rated/streamed)  The project will also be on all digital platforms, Itunes,Apple Music, Spotify,Tidal, Deezer,Amazon music, Google Music etc</p>
<p><strong>EXTRA EXTRA</strong></p>
<p>Any thing in addition to the goal will go towards a larger marketing company and merchandise ass you can see I already have some really fashionable merch for you guys and I'm constantly creating new designs which includes hats, key chains,bags tshirts, jogger suits, leggins etc</p>
<p>If you aren’t in a place to contribute financially that is ok!  You can support my movement by following me on social media platforms and help us get the word out about our campaign!</p>

<h3>ALABAMA ROSE IS RECORDING A NEW RECORD...</h3>
<p>And we're hoping you'll help us make it as badass as possible. </p>
<p>We've been working hard this year and are ready to get back to the studio to record our first full length album. Our goal for this campaign is to raise $3500 towards our recording costs, which will help us to add special elements to our album that we think you'll love. Please help us to spread the word about our campaign!! As incentive to help us, we've been putting together special merch packages for our backers. Here's what you can get!!</p>
<ul>
<li>$20- t-shirt of your choice + physical copy of EP ""Good Times for Bad Girls"" </li>
<li>$50- both Alabama Rose t-shirts + physical copy of EP + sticker pack </li>
<li>$100- we lose our minds + you get a piece of all of our merch (2 t-shirts, EP, sticker pack, custom lighter and matchbook) + physical copy of LP </li>
<li>$100+- minds are blown + all merch items + LP + custom merch specifically made for YOU (art work, photo prints, whatever you like, made for you by Rose herself)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Are We Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Honestly, recording is expensive as hell. Our campaign will help us to raise almost half of what we'll need for our recording time. This is something we've never done for ourselves, and have our fingers crossed for the best. We chose Indiegogo because we get to keep any funds that we receive, even if we don't reach our goal. If we get 175 people to back us with $20, we'll reach it, no problem!! This'll help us to add special elements to our album. Think gospel choir and horn section. That's where we're hoping to go.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Donation Makes A Difference...</h3>
<p>Any amount helps. And we'll be working our butts off right along with you.</p>

<h3>Help Us Spread The Word!!</h3>
<p>Some people can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

<h3>*****INDIE MUSIC TOUR DE FORCE******</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>So I'm a film maker who was in the middle of pre-production on the film<strong> <u>Matt Lewandowski and the Purple people</u></strong> which highlighted a futuristic America and how the empire crumbled.</p>
<p>Covid-19 said, you want to a do a film on a dystopian American future, hold my beer.  So my plans were temporarily thwarted.  Little did Mr. Corona know that I can maneuver my writing talents from the world of film to the world of music.</p>
<p>So the film was a beat by beat thriller of how America entered the 2nd Civil War - I took that same energy and put it towards a concept album.</p>
<p>So I wrote a 14 track/5 Skit album that connects to the movie and is literally a re-hash of everything that happened in America up until December 31st, 2020 - it's basically a timeline of this crazy year - just highlighting everything I've seen but from a 3rd person perspective - we're not taking sides.  I collaborated with some of the worlds greatest unsigned artist to put this thing together, the fact that this was culled together on a shoe string budget in under 2 months is little more than a miracle.</p>
<p>This is the most High Concept risky album that I can think of in a long time.  Consider the genesis of the album being this INDIE FILM about a modern civil war that has manifested itself into a concept album that doubles as an introspective look at America in 2020.  This is the most meta music is going to get in the 21st century lol</p>
<p>If you're worried about, well what Genre of music are we getting?  As you can see per the short medley in the video - we're spanning at least 7 different Genres, From Pop, to dance, to Hip Hop, to Rock, to Pop Punk to Blues and what I once called grunge(even though no one technically liked to call it that in the 90s).  All these genres had a profound influence on me growing up.  So it's a cornucopia of vibes.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to finish production on the Final 4 songs maybe 5 if I'm being more accurate (including the music videos) and then have the whole album mastered.  At this point in the game there might be an investment opportunity as I have my own vanity publishing so there may be an opportunity to come in as an investor and own piece of the publishing and there's a chance to earn money that way if sales sky rocket.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a country so deeply torn apart, it needs an outside perspective - one that can show it the way and help it get back on track.  Maybe this album helps kicks off 2021 to become the greatest rebound year in our countries history - and to have it start with an album from a bunch of underdogs would  exemplify the fortitude of America, and quite frankly the world. A world which has undergone a seismic transformation this year.</li>
<li>My mom cried listening to one of the tracks.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no risks. If I meet the goal.  The album happens .  And whether I meet the goal or not The first single drops August 26th cause that's where my money ran out creating this album.  It ran out mastering that single and producing a music video.   When we meet the goal, the album is a go and will be released October 28th.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Like I said, investing is another way to help from a financial perspective and it might turn out to be a lucrative investment.  Like a stock investment - While it doesn't have the big names as you might like these are all up and coming independent artist.  You can help make this album the factory for future pop and rock stars. </p>
<p>On the creative side i'm always looking to collaborate.  If you are a musician or vocalist and you think maybe you can add something to this album, like I said we're still working on a few of the songs - I love working with other artist and helping promote all crafts.  In that regard we help each other.  I'm open to everything, shoot me your thoughts or questions.  I'm excited about the potential of this.</p>
</div></div>","*****INDIE MUSIC TOUR DE FORCE******
 
So I'm a film maker who was in the middle of pre-production on the film Matt Lewandowski and the Purple people which highlighted a futuristic America and how the empire crumbled.
Covid-19 said, you want to a do a film on a dystopian American future, hold my beer.  So my plans were temporarily thwarted.  Little did Mr. Corona know that I can maneuver my writing talents from the world of film to the world of music.
So the film was a beat by beat thriller of how America entered the 2nd Civil War - I took that same energy and put it towards a concept album.
So I wrote a 14 track/5 Skit album that connects to the movie and is literally a re-hash of everything that happened in America up until December 31st, 2020 - it's basically a timeline of this crazy year - just highlighting everything I've seen but from a 3rd person perspective - we're not taking sides.  I collaborated with some of the worlds greatest unsigned artist to put this thing together, the fact that this was culled together on a shoe string budget in under 2 months is little more than a miracle.
This is the most High Concept risky album that I can think of in a long time.  Consider the genesis of the album being this INDIE FILM about a modern civil war that has manifested itself into a concept album that doubles as an introspective look at America in 2020.  This is the most meta music is going to get in the 21st century lol
If you're worried about, well what Genre of music are we getting?  As you can see per the short medley in the video - we're spanning at least 7 different Genres, From Pop, to dance, to Hip Hop, to Rock, to Pop Punk to Blues and what I once called grunge(even though no one technically liked to call it that in the 90s).  All these genres had a profound influence on me growing up.  So it's a cornucopia of vibes.
Think of it like ""Hamilton"" the musical - Only the story takes place in 2020 America - and everyone of YOU are characters in this story!
This album will literally be a collectors item you can give to your children to help explain your trip through memory lane as you look back at the year of 2020 and the bumpy journey we all went through but it will remind you we are in this together and we WERE in this together.

<h1><b>The Complete Classical Piano Course </b></h1>
<p><b>Four Volumes with CDS &amp; Web Link.</b></p>
<p>by <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">John Geraghty</span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</span></p>
<p>As a private
piano teacher for many years, I have developed an approach to learning the
piano that <i>is fast and effective</i>. It
has worked for every student that I have taught from the ages of 5 <span>– 75 years old. Contrary to what people say, you
don't have to be young to start playing the piano. In fact, I have found that
adults learn faster than kids.</span></p>
<p><b>Why I created the course</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">After seeing lots of piano students learning from You Tube videos, I felt that there was a need for a comprehensive course that can train a music student from beginner level to an intermediate / advance level without the need for a private teacher. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">There are four fundamental problems when learning from You Tube videos.</span></p>
<p>1. You don't learn the grammar (Notes and Rhythm). By not learning how to read the music you end up learning the music by ear. </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">2. You don't learn <i>technique</i>. By not training your fingers you are not able to articulate the music correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">3. You don't learn <i>theory</i>. You don't understand what you are playing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">4. You don't have a consistent teacher. Imagine learning English at school by ten different teachers? Music is a language also.</span></p>

<div>At the moment apart from working on this pitch, I have just sent off Book 3 to have the inside designed. This will probably take between 1-2 months to complete as it's the largest of the 4 books. The other 3 books are finished. </div>
<div>I also have about 25 videos to edit and then I'll have to upload all the videos onto the website, once t<span style=""background-color: initial;"">he website designer has finished the layout.</span>

<div>I'm hoping for around November to have it all finished and printed ready for sale for the Christmas rush! but I can't guarantee this as I'm relying on other people to get there jobs finished and don't want them to rush their work.  </div>

Four Volumes with CDS & Web Link.
by John Geraghty



As a private
piano teacher for many years, I have developed an approach to learning the
piano that is fast and effective. It
has worked for every student that I have taught from the ages of 5 – 75 years old. Contrary to what people say, you
don't have to be young to start playing the piano. In fact, I have found that
adults learn faster than kids.
Why I created the course

After seeing lots of piano students learning from You Tube videos, I felt that there was a need for a comprehensive course that can train a music student from beginner level to an intermediate / advance level without the need for a private teacher. 
There are four fundamental problems when learning from You Tube videos.
1. You don't learn the grammar (Notes and Rhythm). By not learning how to read the music you end up learning the music by ear. 
2. You don't learn technique. By not training your fingers you are not able to articulate the music correctly.
3. You don't learn theory. You don't understand what you are playing.
4. You don't have a consistent teacher. Imagine learning English at school by ten different teachers? Music is a language also.
About the course.

The Complete Classical Piano Course is a comprehensive self-learning
guide to classical piano. The course consists of 4 books, 3 cds and unlimited access to over 800 HD
videos online (mobile friendly!). 


This course is designed for the following students… 
Beginners wanting to learn
from the beginning to an intermediate/advanced standard of reading, playing and technique.

Students that played
""a long time ago"" and now wish to start again.

Intermediate students that
can read well, but would like to learn new skills.
Musicians, songwriters and producers who want to enhance their playing skills.
As a training guide for
all levels of piano teaching.

To work through the course you will only need access to a cd player and a mobile phone or ipad. This course can also be learnt on a keyboard (touch sensitive/pedal). You will not need to sit in front of a computer to learn from it!


THIS COURSE OFFERS NO GIMMICKS, NO FLASHING LIGHTS JUST GREAT CONTENT!

Whats inside...


Book One - Manual

In this book you learn and master the understanding of music. There are three essential parts that you would study.


Notes 
Rhythm
Theory


CD 1

CD
1 covers everything you need to know and more about
reading rhythms, from beginner to advanced levels. 

Book Two - Technique
In Book Two you learn and master technique. There are two training programmes. ""Technique Programme—A""  is an 18-month training programme covering all 12 major and minor keys in scales, arpeggios and broken chords. Each
week, you will learn new exercises that cover the essential techniques that
train every finger and thumb. You will develop control, tone and speed.
Mastering these techniques provides the skills required to play any
type of music style. ""Technique Programme—B""  is a 10-month training programme. This will train you
in general playing techniques. This will not only help with classical piano
techniques, but also other musical styles including jazz through pop piano. CD 2

Audio CD 2 will help develop your
""musical"" ears. When teaching oneself, it is important to know the
pitfalls before you make them. This CD will make you aware of all the
fundamental problems that you may encounter. 

Book Three - Practice Notes

In Book 3—Practice Notes, you
will study how to practise efficiently through “The Art of Practising”. This
volume also serves as a supplementary guide to each level of music found in Book 4—Music. 




CD 3
You also cover aural training found under
sections entitled Aural Awareness. These
points refer you back to CD 3 to listen to the musical examples so that you can
train your ears musically.

Book Four - Music

Book 4—Music  features five
levels of well-known piano repertoire, each level contains six pieces of music
from the Baroque, Classical and Romantic eras.

Each piece of music
introduces new playing techniques that will enable you to improve your piano
playing skills and sightreading abilities.
The music can also be accessed online and streamed and downloaded.
 
Online Videos   
After entering the password, the student will be able to access over 800 HD videos. These videos are there to watch for correct technique. 

Everything that would be played throughout the course has been recorded.
This includes all the scales, arpeggios and broken chords  found in ""Technique Programme—A"".

""Technique Programme—B"" and all thirty pieces of music.                        

Each
piece of music has been played by the right and left hand and also hands
together.


That's the course!
What the funds will be used for.
£5500 would allow me to print off 500 copies of each book and £2500 will allow me to finish the Website.
If I received extra funds then I would use the money for marketing the product. 

Current stage of project.

At the moment apart from working on this pitch, I have just sent off Book 3 to have the inside designed. This will probably take between 1-2 months to complete as it's the largest of the 4 books. The other 3 books are finished. 
I also have about 25 videos to edit and then I'll have to upload all the videos onto the website, once the website designer has finished the layout.

I'm hoping for around November to have it all finished and printed ready for sale for the Christmas rush! but I can't guarantee this as I'm relying on other people to get there jobs finished and don't want them to rush their work.  


On a personal note. 


As you can see it's a pretty ambitious project. There's been a lot of late nights, lots of coffee and a massive steep learning curve. In the last year I've learnt ....
How to write a business plan, pitching to the bank, print on demand, long and short run printers, saddle stitch and perfect bound books, good and bad cameras for HD video filming/lighting and Final Cut Pro editing, online/offline marketing, page design/layouts, negotiating contracts, setting up a new book publishing company ""Green Olive Publications Ltd"" (I wanted the books to look as professional as possible) and finally pitching on Indiegogo!
I really need your help to complete this project and any funding would be gratefully received. 
Thanks
John

Expect a blend of acoustic and electric sounds with a good helping of modern rock and Celtic folk.  You can hear a demo for one track, There But For the Grace of God Go I, on Reverbnation. The second is titled Knotwork- A collection of traditional Irish and Scottish folk songs, electrified and rocked up in the style of bands like the Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly, and the Rumjacks.  The first completed song is Step it Out Mary, which features the amazing Celia on guest vocals.  Oh yeah- You can hear that one on Reverbnation as well.Finally, something I've always wanted to do:  Knotwork will simultaneously be released in both electric and acoustic versions- Same songs, but one album of hard hitting Irish punk, and one arranged for traditional acoustic guitar, mandolin, bodhron, accordion, and fiddle.  This album will be titled Knotwork: The Parlor Mixes, and will be available separately, or bundled with the electric version.  Once again, there's a sample for you to listen to.Where Are We?At present, several of the songs on What This Day Will Bring are each roughly 3/4 recorded.  Sharon Knight and Winter have already contributed tracks, and I am searching for a couple session players to fill in a few of the instruments I don't actually play, like bagpipes and sitar.I have also mostly finished recording 4-5 of the roughly 15 songs on Knotwork and the Parlor Mixes.These are being recorded at my home studio, with the possibility of recording drums and maybe a couple other tracks elsewhere, then sending them off to Robert for mixing and mastering- Essentially the same process we followed for Gypsy Heart.Where Crowdfunding Comes InMy studio has had some major upgrades since recording the last CD, but still needs some work to really bring out the best.  First and foremost is the computer that forms the backbone of the recording setup:  After the old one died, it was replaced with a loaner.  While it's mostly adequate, it has a few issues which can't really be fixed.  There is also the chance that I may need to return it without notice at any time- So, this needs to be replaced.Second are the costs of some of the studio musicians.  Depending on who they are and what kind of working relationship we already have, this can vary pretty widely.  Even the close friends who volunteer (or trade for my backing tracks on their project) still get dinner and gas money.Third are the costs of mixing and mastering.  These are the final steps after the album is fully recorded, and is an art and a science all it's own, and even the major label pro studios usually farm this out to an expert.  I'm lucky to have a longstanding friendship with someone I trust to do a great job at a reasonable cost.Finally, there is the percentage that goes to IndieGoGo, the cost to manufacture the CDs themselves, getting set up on iTunes, Amazon, etc., and producing any perks like t-shirts or posters for backers.When is this all happening?Mostly, right now!  I'm actively recording already, and it's only the hired session players who will need to wait until funding comes through.  I expect to be able to complete the recording portion of the first CD within a month of being funded, and to finish the second while it is off being mixed.  This will probably take a few weeks, and then there's another couple weeks turnaround to print physical CDs.Knotwork and The Parlor Mixes will be recorded concurrently, as it is largely during the mixing phase when they become separate projects.  This means almost no additional time to record, but mixing and mastering will take twice as long.The goal is to finish recording Knotwork/The Parlor Mixes by the middle of August, and have them mastered by the end of September- at which point I should be done recording What This Day Will Bring.  With any luck, finished CDs and digital downloads should be available by Halloween and X-Mas, respectively.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I am from Ireland, I sing Irish traditional song including Sean Nós, which means the old style and is always in the Irish language. 2016 is a big year for Ireland and the Irish because we are celebrating the centenary of the Easter Rising, the great visionary rebellion which started the beginning of the end of the largest empire on earth.</p>
<p>The Easter Rising was led by poets and visionaries who wanted political separation of Ireland from England, and it began with the Easter Proclamation, a document which is of equal significance to Irish men and women as the Declaration of Independence is to Americans.  </p>
<p>Irish people are proud of this proclamation and the extraordinary people who penned it and we are celebrating their vision and courage this year; 100 years after their courageous rebellion (and the execution of its leaders) inspired the Irish people break to their chains of bondage and take their place amongst the nations of the earth.  </p>
<p>I was amongst 9 artists (selected from over 260 proposals) who were selected by the Irish Arts Council to produce an artistic creation which honoured the rising and its legacy and I had <b>1916 - Visionaries and their Words</b> performed to critical acclaim in January and February.

<div>I have composed and rehearsed ten songs for the show <i>1916 - Visionaries and their Words </i>which I now wish to make into an album. I have started this process and have recorded 9 songs in studio and to finish off the project I will need to raise the money to do so. </div>
<div>I wish to record one more song, a number of spoken word pieces which were written by Pearse and Plunkett.  </div> <p>At the moment we have unmixed recordings of most of the songs on the album. We have been performing the show live and have it thoroughly rehearsed but now we need to spend a little more time in studio, mix, master, design and press CDs. I have raised half the money I needed to do this and am now seeking your help to get the final funds together.</p>
<p>In return for your support you can get a copy of the album. A digital download or a physical copy with a 20 page booklet including notes and song words. </p>
<p>I will be producing a limited number of booklets -A5, 32 page, full colour- which will give extensive background on the songs on the album, and info about their authors and the context in which they were written. All this will be beautifully illustrated with archive images I have sourced in over 6 months of research,</p>
<p>And there is lots of other music from my back catalogue of course. Music which is inspired by Irish mythology and history; and which features texts taken from ancient Gaelic manuscripts.</p>
<p>All the funds I raise will go towards producing a beautiful physical memento of the centenary of the Rising, along with a permanent musical homage to the most inspiring Irish men of the past 100 years. The lyrics and music are ready, it is now just a matter of delivering them in a tasteful and high quality format.

As a way to learn more about what drove Pearse, Plunkett, Connolly, Ceannt, and the other signatories of the proclamation, this is a great help because it focuses on what they were passionate about and reveals what gave them their passion. </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This will be my sixth independently produced album.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Darryl Lenard Badley Jr. I am a disabled Army veteran and father of 5. I got saved in the military and that experience catapulted me to help as many of my brothers and sister in arms live better lives and overcome their challenges. Its not always about the building that people attend on Sundays but what we can do for the people we see the other 6 days of the week. When I was medically retired from the Army in 2002 I went to school for music.  Life happened, and I had to get a job. I literally walked into the Radio One office in Richmond, VA and asked for a job in 2003. I was hired on the spot and I never looked back. My love of music, radio, and love for sharing hope is what I live for.  This is my passion. Being a Hope Peddler! With a very Deep Booming Radio Voice.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589961176/sayipz4otlf9a3wqautj.jpg"" src=""""/>My campaign is to do my very best to impact as many of the 18.4 million Christian veterans dealing with all types of issues and drama in their lives and maybe just maybe change the mind of someone who was considering a much worse alternative. <strong>(</strong><b><i>FACT: 19 veterans commit suicide everyday) </i></b><i>That's not counting the ones that tried and failed and now have to live with yet another failure. Can you imagine trying to commit suicide because you consider yourself a failure and you screw that up? Now add to that the number of veterans that deal with their issues with drugs alcohol or other self destructive means.</i></p>
<p><i> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590144474/tdtb8ov2sfgoorgauuw0.png"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p><i>Many of <i><strong>US</strong></i> refuse to get the help we need and don't trust civilian doctors. I want to create a platform that those veterans sitting in his house alone with a bottle of whatever can click on his phone and listen to uplifting music and inspiring content that could be the turning point to their recovery. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590144333/jh9qiwdo0i5j2adhjwsu.png"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p>I need money to make sure I am continuously providing a resource that can help thousands of veterans and do that full time. The end goal is to get that huge number down to 18! Being the ONLY media outlet in the country specifically targeting this population it is a very daunting task. This is why it is my plan to use a similar model for growth as traditional terrestrial station, launch and sustain Christian Warrior Digital Radio affiliates in every market in the united states that host the major media chains.  This will ensure if their is a veteran in Oregon that needs assistance they can reach out to the local affiliate. This will also mean that there are hundreds if not thousands of veterans operating digital radio stations around the country. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>So if you recall in the previous section I am the father of 5! These are my little babies. I am the small guy with the bald head. This at the graduation of the one in the middle who is currently in college. The one next to him is also in college. The one on the other end is already being scouted by college football scouts. and yes, the princess and my grand daughter round out the lot. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589959825/svq0jvfavf3hiunnpunm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Running any operation with excellence requires a time commitment that results in a full time job. The funds for this endeavor will go to purchasing the equipment for broadcasting, Travel, office rental, marketing materials, and salaries for the 3 to 6 employees needed to successfully operate a fully functioning radio station. Our operational budget is a little more than $120,000 annually, 60 percent of that is salary and benefits.</p>
<h3>Internet Radio is the Future</h3>
<p>Here is a staggering number, <u><strong>$1,000,000,000! </strong></u>That is the amount of money that has been gained, at the expense of terrestrial radio in the past 10 years. Digital radio is the terrestrial radio as digital phones are to analog. Eventually, there will no longer be huge antennas broadcast over an AM or FM signal.  The graph below shows the ages of those who consume digital radio. It is fair to assume that if those who are in the 24 and under continue to consume in this fashion, there will be no need for FM radio at all within the next 40 year or less. Taking this into account, we seek to ride the digital tsunami and use the best practices of the top media companies in the World.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are three main risk and challenges that we are facing with this endeavor.</p>
<ol>
<li>So many businesses are struggling due to the current pandemic and the availability of funds to advertise and promote on radio may be lacking. This also will greatly hinder our ability to conduct business face to face.</li>
<li>The second risk is that fact that there is the possibility that the current pandemic drags out longer than anticipated. The more there is suffering the less people are willing to spend money.</li>
<li>The third challenge is push back from organizations that don't understand the facts concerning digital media and the growth it has had over the past three years.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these issues have literally been resolved because of themselves. The national pandemic has shown us that we very resilient when it comes to continuing operations remotely.  The flow of money and resources has shifted but by no means has gone away. The many video teleconferencing platforms and remote file sharing make it just as viable to conduct a successful enterprises from home. As an Army retiree, I have been trained to adapt improvise and overcome in any situation.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are 18 Million Veterans in this country.  I am sure if you are reading this you know a few.  Every one counts. Thats what makes this truly genuine.

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Darryl Lenard Badley Jr. I am a disabled Army veteran and father of 5. I got saved in the military and that experience catapulted me to help as many of my brothers and sister in arms live better lives and overcome their challenges. Its not always about the building that people attend on Sundays but what we can do for the people we see the other 6 days of the week. When I was medically retired from the Army in 2002 I went to school for music.  Life happened, and I had to get a job. I literally walked into the Radio One office in Richmond, VA and asked for a job in 2003. I was hired on the spot and I never looked back. My love of music, radio, and love for sharing hope is what I live for.  This is my passion. Being a Hope Peddler! With a very Deep Booming Radio Voice.
My campaign is to do my very best to impact as many of the 18.4 million Christian veterans dealing with all types of issues and drama in their lives and maybe just maybe change the mind of someone who was considering a much worse alternative. (FACT: 19 veterans commit suicide everyday) That's not counting the ones that tried and failed and now have to live with yet another failure. Can you imagine trying to commit suicide because you consider yourself a failure and you screw that up? Now add to that the number of veterans that deal with their issues with drugs alcohol or other self destructive means.
 
Many of US refuse to get the help we need and don't trust civilian doctors. I want to create a platform that those veterans sitting in his house alone with a bottle of whatever can click on his phone and listen to uplifting music and inspiring content that could be the turning point to their recovery. 
I need money to make sure I am continuously providing a resource that can help thousands of veterans and do that full time. The end goal is to get that huge number down to 18! Being the ONLY media outlet in the country specifically targeting this population it is a very daunting task. This is why it is my plan to use a similar model for growth as traditional terrestrial station, launch and sustain Christian Warrior Digital Radio affiliates in every market in the united states that host the major media chains.  This will ensure if their is a veteran in Oregon that needs assistance they can reach out to the local affiliate. This will also mean that there are hundreds if not thousands of veterans operating digital radio stations around the country. 

What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:
So if you recall in the previous section I am the father of 5! These are my little babies. I am the small guy with the bald head. This at the graduation of the one in the middle who is currently in college. The one next to him is also in college. The one on the other end is already being scouted by college football scouts. and yes, the princess and my grand daughter round out the lot. 

Running any operation with excellence requires a time commitment that results in a full time job. The funds for this endeavor will go to purchasing the equipment for broadcasting, Travel, office rental, marketing materials, and salaries for the 3 to 6 employees needed to successfully operate a fully functioning radio station. Our operational budget is a little more than $120,000 annually, 60 percent of that is salary and benefits.
Internet Radio is the Future
Here is a staggering number, $1,000,000,000! That is the amount of money that has been gained, at the expense of terrestrial radio in the past 10 years. Digital radio is the terrestrial radio as digital phones are to analog. Eventually, there will no longer be huge antennas broadcast over an AM or FM signal.  The graph below shows the ages of those who consume digital radio. It is fair to assume that if those who are in the 24 and under continue to consume in this fashion, there will be no need for FM radio at all within the next 40 year or less. Taking this into account, we seek to ride the digital tsunami and use the best practices of the top media companies in the World.

 
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THIS COMPANY? MY POINT EXACTLY!

Clear channel, now I Heart Media,  leveraged its digital platform and went as far as to re brand itself to reflect the changing times. Doing so has now secured them the second spot of the digital plain behind Spotify. Our goal is to use that same logic and game plan but specifying veterans. 
What if We don't Reach Our Goal?
If the full amount of the funds are not raised, that will mean that I will either have to let some of the staff I intend to hire go and be forced to do the work of two or three myself. Obviously, the buck stops with me but part of the whole point of this endeavor is helping other veterans gain sustainability. But more to the point we are creating a service for veterans unlike anything seen before.

Risks & Challenges
There are three main risk and challenges that we are facing with this endeavor.

So many businesses are struggling due to the current pandemic and the availability of funds to advertise and promote on radio may be lacking. This also will greatly hinder our ability to conduct business face to face.
The second risk is that fact that there is the possibility that the current pandemic drags out longer than anticipated. The more there is suffering the less people are willing to spend money.
The third challenge is push back from organizations that don't understand the facts concerning digital media and the growth it has had over the past three years.

<p>1st September 2017, I made a promise to myself that I would truly start to honour this life path of becoming a singer-songwriter, connecting to the world through my songs and the stage as my home. <br/><br/>I picked up my guitar for the first time in months, and started writing. <br/><br/>The years prior to this moment, had seen a complex duality of who I wanted to be and who I felt expected to be.

<h3><strong>The Breakdown - How are we going to do this? </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Introducing you to the wonderful musician, guitarist and producer who is helping with the full creation of this EP, Michael Stanton. He has worked alongside many other musicians such as Ayla Schafer, Susie Ro and Faeland who are all an integral part of inspiration to my journey.</p>
<p>Michael Stanton and I met in the wintry month of January where we sat down and started to envision the full colour spectrum of the songs. </p>
<p>Meeting Michael has been an incredible blessing on this journey. Until recently, I felt a lack of growth in the right direction. It was important for me that the right producer not only understood my music but also understood the way I danced internally, especially when working on a project that's so vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>The Musical Instruments </strong></p>
<p>We are still at the very early stages of this project, however, these are some of the musical instruments we have envisioned on the tracks that are going to be recorded for the EP. No Musicians have yet been contacted but we do already have a list of musicians we hope to use. </p>
<ul>
<li>Cello</li>
<li>Violin</li>
<li>Percussion </li>
<li>Double Bass</li>
<li>Classical Guitar </li>
<li>Clarinet </li>
<li>Harp </li>
<li>Native Flute</li>
<li>Ngoni </li>
<li>Piano </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Your generous support will go towards the costs of paying the wonderful musicians as this is very important!</p>
<p>A rough outline of where the costs will be going if I meet my target. Any extra money will be going towards a UK and European tour and more media outlets.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Studio Hire  (10%)</li>
<li>Musicians  (15%)</li>
<li>Producer  (15%)</li>
<li>Mixing and Mastering  (20%)</li>
<li>Professional Video  (10%)</li>
<li>Artwork + Printing of CD's  (25%)</li>
<li>Fee's and Postage of perks (5%)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Doing a campaign so early on in this journey does provide some risks, however, if I do not meet my target, I am still committed to fulfilling this task and providing you with an EP. There would be some compromises to how many instruments will be used, the artwork and media outlets, but all perks will be sent towards the end of July.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Plan </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Listed below is a goal-orientated plan! We will keep you informed when we have reached these goals! </p>
<ul>
<li>Making Demo's </li>
<li>Visioning songs and writing of other instrumental parts </li>
<li>Contacting musicians to play parts</li>
<li>Get together to play the songs and change anything that may need changing</li>
<li>Record parts</li>
<li>Master </li>
<li>Release! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I am limiting this project to 3 months. Ideally, this should be enough time to complete all the tasks, however, this is music and there are always short-falls, and mishaps, but I am confident in meeting our goals within a good distance. </p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the crowdfunder, the music, rewards or any other issue, please do not hesitate to contact!</p>

<h3><strong>Lucy Wylde: Who am I? </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When I think about putting myself into words, I always become blank, not because I don't know who I am, but because I have no idea how to describe how my music! </p>
<p>Imagine an array of balmy seas, mixed with a dash of vibrant celestial colour, sunshine, deep blue waters, and a heart full of love. Imagine being faced with a moment of empathy, someone who sees you and is not afraid to express their darkness in the turn of the light. A bridging of two worlds, an acceptance and relief of my journey put into melodies and words. </p>
<p>Every song, carefully grasped by the light of the dark, a moment of balance, truth and beauty. </p>
<p>Born in Devon, Lucy Wylde captures the heart lines of the soul, her celestial essence mixed with the history of her past, brings an emotive picturesque and a calling for the heart to come home. Her melodies transcend landscapes through the mind, creating waves and flutters of seeds and gardens full of pure beauty and oneness. </p>
<p>Her music took a turning point back in January 2017 when she dedicated her path to healing the wounds that she had carried for so long. Through this journey, she met some of the most beautiful soul teachers, guidance, and support from her community, and her heart started to open. She started to remember why she was here and the gift and stories that she wanted to bring to the people. </p>
<p>In September 2017, she made a promise to herself to dedicate her life to her music, for it is her soul mission on this earth. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Such a magical voice!"" -David Ginn</p>
<p>""Totally breathtaking performance! We were blown away by your very unique and unforgettable performance!"" - Jess Bundy </p>
<p>""Everytime I see her, I am stunned by the power of her voice! I cannot help but be mesmerised by her beautiful lyrics and the way that sings with all her heart and soul. Her music melts my heart. She is incredible talented."" Bethany Carter</p>

It was important for me that the right producer not only understood my music but also understood the way I danced internally, especially when working on a project that's so vulnerable.
The Musical Instruments 
We are still at the very early stages of this project, however, these are some of the musical instruments we have envisioned on the tracks that are going to be recorded for the EP. No Musicians have yet been contacted but we do already have a list of musicians we hope to use. 

Cello
Violin
Percussion 
Double Bass
Classical Guitar 
Clarinet 
Harp 
Native Flute
Ngoni 
Piano 

 
Your generous support will go towards the costs of paying the wonderful musicians as this is very important!
A rough outline of where the costs will be going if I meet my target. Any extra money will be going towards a UK and European tour and more media outlets.
 

Studio Hire  (10%)
Musicians  (15%)
Producer  (15%)
Mixing and Mastering  (20%)
Professional Video  (10%)
Artwork + Printing of CD's  (25%)
Fee's and Postage of perks (5%)

 
Doing a campaign so early on in this journey does provide some risks, however, if I do not meet my target, I am still committed to fulfilling this task and providing you with an EP. There would be some compromises to how many instruments will be used, the artwork and media outlets, but all perks will be sent towards the end of July.
 
The Plan 
 
Listed below is a goal-orientated plan! We will keep you informed when we have reached these goals! 

Making Demo's 
Visioning songs and writing of other instrumental parts 
Contacting musicians to play parts
Get together to play the songs and change anything that may need changing
Record parts
Master 
Release! 

 
I am limiting this project to 3 months. Ideally, this should be enough time to complete all the tasks, however, this is music and there are always short-falls, and mishaps, but I am confident in meeting our goals within a good distance. 
If you have any questions regarding the crowdfunder, the music, rewards or any other issue, please do not hesitate to contact!

Lucy Wylde: Who am I? 
 
When I think about putting myself into words, I always become blank, not because I don't know who I am, but because I have no idea how to describe how my music! 
Imagine an array of balmy seas, mixed with a dash of vibrant celestial colour, sunshine, deep blue waters, and a heart full of love. Imagine being faced with a moment of empathy, someone who sees you and is not afraid to express their darkness in the turn of the light. A bridging of two worlds, an acceptance and relief of my journey put into melodies and words. 
Every song, carefully grasped by the light of the dark, a moment of balance, truth and beauty. 
Born in Devon, Lucy Wylde captures the heart lines of the soul, her celestial essence mixed with the history of her past, brings an emotive picturesque and a calling for the heart to come home. Her melodies transcend landscapes through the mind, creating waves and flutters of seeds and gardens full of pure beauty and oneness. 
Her music took a turning point back in January 2017 when she dedicated her path to healing the wounds that she had carried for so long. Through this journey, she met some of the most beautiful soul teachers, guidance, and support from her community, and her heart started to open. She started to remember why she was here and the gift and stories that she wanted to bring to the people. 
In September 2017, she made a promise to herself to dedicate her life to her music, for it is her soul mission on this earth. 
 
""Such a magical voice!"" -David Ginn
""Totally breathtaking performance! We were blown away by your very unique and unforgettable performance!"" - Jess Bundy 
""Everytime I see her, I am stunned by the power of her voice! I cannot help but be mesmerised by her beautiful lyrics and the way that sings with all her heart and soul. Her music melts my heart. She is incredible talented."" Bethany Carter",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong><i>My Story</i></strong></h3>
<p>I have been active in many areas of music for most of my life.  I was enchanted after seeing a movie about an orchestra as a small child and hearing a good choir a few years later.  The seed was planted.  As a young man, I had experience on the piano, saxophone, and the classical guitar, which became my primary instrument for over 30 years.  I took first prize in the Boston Guitar Circle competition in the 1960's.</p>
<p>In 1991 I decided to concentrate on composition rather than performance and developed a unique style that avoids the excessive dissonance and chaos too evident in the works of other modern composers.  My style, while formally atonal, does not shy away from the frequent use of melody and harmony, while at the same time avoiding obvious references to 19th-century tonal music; this style has been characterized as ""locally tonal"".  It is rewarding, both intellectually and emotionally, and its effectiveness is due partly to raw inspiration and partly to my unique way of going about the composition process.  The fact that I never attended a conservatory is one of the happy circumstances that contribute to my unique sound.  My work is structured, organic, and contains an endless variety of musical effects that include homophony, polyphony, orchestral fireworks, leitmotivs, and the occasional tone cluster.</p>
<p>My works to date include operas, song cycles, and chamber music. I composed the well-known Annabel Lee, recorded by Joan Baez in the 60's.  An arrangement of that work for three instruments and mezzo was performed in New York by members of the Metropolitan Opera in 2003  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vd5hIvlCNE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vd5hIvlCNE</a>  My operas include<i> Rostam, Rasputin, The Inca</i>, and a set of three one-acts: <i>The Decision, The Love Machine, and Top Secret.</i> To these may be added an operetta,<i> The Ms Seattle Skyline Contest,</i> with a libretto by Linda Rimel, and the ballet <i>The Brothers of Judar</i>, set to an Arabian Nights story.  My song cycles include a set of five songs to poems of William Blake, a set of 39 songs to classical Indian love poems, and settings of Longfellow for mezzo voice and piano and for SATB chorus.  Other choral music includes <i>There is Peace</i>, to a libretto by Linda Rimel.  My chamber works include Seven Attitudes for Horn, with a version for clarinet.  I have also written string quartets.  I was for many years the President of the Maine Composer's Forum and I am represented by BMI.  Aside from music, I also hold a BS in physics from MIT.</p>
<h3><strong><i>About the Opera Rostam</i></strong></h3>
<p>The opera tells the story of the Persian hero Rostam, as described in the classic 11th-century epic The Shahnameh, by Ferdowsi, who is the Persian's Shakespeare.  His epic is almost unknown in the West and is a masterpiece, and that is why I selected it for my opera.  Rostam is their greatest warrior.  During his 600-year life, he spent exactly one night in the company of a woman, a princess named Tahmina, and the result of that union was his son Sohrab.<br/><br/>According to the story, Rostam, who was off on his military campaigns, knew nothing about Sohrab, and the latter did not know who his father was since Tahmina had reasons for keeping it secret. The movement we are going to perform and record tells of when Tahmina at last, informs Sohrab, who is now a young man, of his father.  Sohrab is inspired by an overwhelming vision of himself and Rostam together ascending the throne.  Despite the tears and pleading of Tahmina, Sohrab gathers his sword and armor and sets off to find his father.</p>
<p>Operas must, of course, tell of conflict, sacrifice, and inevitable death from conspiring events.  Rostam and Sohrab meet on the battlefield in the last movement, but not until Sohrab has been mortally wounded does Rostam discover who his opponent is. He cradles Sohrab as his son dies.</p>
<h3><i><strong>The Goal of the Fundraiser</strong></i></h3>
<p>The goal is to raise sufficient funds to support an Opera Workshop, to be held at the Snow Pond Music Camp, Sidney, Maine, in the Spring of 2018.  We will rehearse and record one movement from the opera with professional-quality musicians, and then approach qualified opera companies with that recording, with the goal of inspiring them to mount a full production.  Nobody is going to produce a new opera unless they are convinced it is a wonderful work that absolutely should be performed.  A great recording of a beautiful movement should convince them</p>
<h3><strong><i>Why should anyone support the fundraising effort?</i></strong></h3>
<p>Well, to start with, this is an opera that sounds like music, as distinguished from many modern works that sound more like noise. This is an opera that people will gladly pay to hear and see, once it becomes known.  An opera that is unperformed solely because it is not yet known. This fundraising is a vital first step in changing that.</p>
<p><strong><em>“A Russian chemist wanted to write an opera, and the result was Prince Igor. That composer had little formal training, but his superb talent made up for it. If a Russian composer can do it, so can an American composer.”</em></strong><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>What we need and how the funds will be applied</i></h3>
<p>The funds raised will pay for the venue, professional musicians, recording costs, miscellaneous expenses, and costs involved with approaching various professional Opera Companies and presenting the finished work</p>
<p><strong>We have a fixed goal of $30,000 for this campaign.  What this means is, if we do not reach this goal, your money will be returned to you.  Even though the goal is $30K, please do not be discouraged to continue donating after the $30K goal is reached.  $50K will allow us to produce an even better demo recording.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here is how the funds will be applied:</strong></p>
<p>$8,000. Musicians and soloists</p>
<p>$2,000. Conductor</p>
<p>$8,000. – Venue rental and expenses – Snowpond Music Camp  <a href=""http://www.snowpond.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.snowpond.org</a></p>
<p>$4,000. – Recording studio time</p>
<p>$3,000. – Post Production – Mixing and Mastering</p>
<p>$3,000. Publicity, Promotion, Promotion <br/><br/>$2,000.Shopping to qualified Opera Production Studios</p>
<p><strong>TOTAL  $30,000</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong><i>Perks</i></strong></h3>
<p>Although I am fully aware that perks are a very important part of any fundraising campaign, I have not gone crazy with tons of different perks.  For larger donations, I am offering valuable original oil paintings depicting scenes from Rostam.  For smaller donations, we have high-quality T-shirts with a screen of original Rostam oil paintings printed on them.  Also, for those who cannot afford a larger donation, we have MP3's of the demo recording and DVD's of the mastered recording if and when it reaches a venue.  I am also offering something I believe to be very interesting.  Free admission vouchers to the Rostam recording session at Snowpond Center for the Arts in Sidney Maine in the Spring of 2018.  Transportation to this event is not included but my feeling is that anyone who has a serious interest in this kind of experience will be willing to spring for the cost of the trip.  I sure hope so anyhow.</p>

In this way, I wish to help everyone to see and bring back the state of joy and harmony that is waiting silently to be seen inside everyone. where the MONEY will go The album will use live recorded instruments, thus a lot of expenses will go for recording, session musicians, studio time, mixing, mastering, and all other work a really good production needs. I'll make sure to create this album as high quality for you as possible! Also, I would like to film a music video for the lead single from the album.The physical printing of the album, the printing of the lyrics book, packaging, etc. will also require important financial investments. thank YOUThank you so much for your support! I hope you know how much it means to me! I am already happy sharing this idea with you. THANK YOU and let’s do something GREAAAAAAAT TOGETHER!",5.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi I’m Andrew, the creator of <strong>Melotivity</strong> app. As many of you guys, I love listening to music while working. I start my workday with searching for the music which could fit my current mood, help me concentrate or motivate me to work harder and cope with my big tasks faster. </p>

<p>Have you had this problem, when you’ve been listening for your favourite track for a while, and then you find yourself unable to concentrate to that important letter because the singer keeps disturbing you? This happened to me a lot, I had to switch the music off and go look for some calm relaxing tunes that would help me concentrate.</p>
<p>Having over 15 years of music making experience I thought - why do I always have to fit with the music’s mood, why not create special music which will fit mine? If  I want to concentrate on a complicated task, I don’t want to be distracted by looking for a suitable track, or if I want to work faster, doing day to day tasks, I want my music to hustle up with me. Here is what I came up with. I’m proud to announce a revolutionary product:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been involved with music since age 11. From being a DJ to being an artist I've experienced many different aspects of the music industry. I have worked in and out several studios throughout New York and Connecticut, I have also performed all around the U.S. That being said, I have been able to grow a solid network to help me reach a substantial amount of people throughout the world. I've released multiple projects so far and have experienced what great marketing can do, as well as the unfortunate results of poor marketing. Each project I've released in the past has had their own budgets, with their own marketing plans. (After all, this is a business).</p>
<p>               After years of funding every project with performance revenue, saved royalties,  and profits from selling merchandise I have always told myself that I would never ask anybody to fund 100% of my project. As time has passed, and the more marketing research for each project completed, I asked myself ""What if I only ask for 50% of what I need?"", This way I'd be able to work to contribute the other 50% myself, prove to my supporters that I'm reliable, at the same time as developing a stronger support system. I've decided to launch this campaign to not only help me fund my next single but to also give my supporters a way to connect with me and my music directly through a project.                     </p>
<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>
<p>The single will be called ""Number One"", it is unlike anything I have ever created before. From the start one of my greatest influences was Richie Valens and the rock music of that decade. Moving from Hip-Hop to EDM I've always tried to incorporate that historic sound somehow, whether it be in a melody or the drums. ""Number One"" not only captures the musical feel I've always wanted to include in my projects, but it is the type of music that I plan to keep creating (if all goes well), it's the beginning of a long road, in which I will need as much support as I can get. </p>
<h3><strong>What Is the Meaning of The Song?</strong></h3>
<p>This song speaks to those who have ever seen somebody somewhere and immediately thought (due to appearance, or any other characteristic) ""they and I should be together"". This then sparks a fantasy in this person's mind creating this perfect world with that person seen, only to find out, in reality, that person is with someone else. (In the song I play the person seen, in the fantasy perspective. I'm a little ugly, so it's a comedic role :D)</p>
<h3>Market Potential</h3>
<p>Already, the song has major commercial appeal, and has more potential to hit the commercial market than any other song I have written. Through my current network, and the production company that will produce the final record, this song is already planned to be shopped out immediately to outlets ranging from TV Networks to Record labels. (Please Note: Those of you who are familiar with the music industry know that production companies will not waste their time shopping out a song without potential.)</p>
<h3><strong>Where Will Your Money Go?</strong></h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I've been involved with music since age 11. From being a DJ to being an artist I've experienced many different aspects of the music industry. I have worked in and out several studios throughout New York and Connecticut, I have also performed all around the U.S. That being said, I have been able to grow a solid network to help me reach a substantial amount of people throughout the world. I've released multiple projects so far and have experienced what great marketing can do, as well as the unfortunate results of poor marketing. Each project I've released in the past has had their own budgets, with their own marketing plans. (After all, this is a business).
               After years of funding every project with performance revenue, saved royalties,  and profits from selling merchandise I have always told myself that I would never ask anybody to fund 100% of my project. As time has passed, and the more marketing research for each project completed, I asked myself ""What if I only ask for 50% of what I need?"", This way I'd be able to work to contribute the other 50% myself, prove to my supporters that I'm reliable, at the same time as developing a stronger support system. I've decided to launch this campaign to not only help me fund my next single but to also give my supporters a way to connect with me and my music directly through a project.                     
The Project
The single will be called ""Number One"", it is unlike anything I have ever created before. From the start one of my greatest influences was Richie Valens and the rock music of that decade. Moving from Hip-Hop to EDM I've always tried to incorporate that historic sound somehow, whether it be in a melody or the drums. ""Number One"" not only captures the musical feel I've always wanted to include in my projects, but it is the type of music that I plan to keep creating (if all goes well), it's the beginning of a long road, in which I will need as much support as I can get. 
What Is the Meaning of The Song?
This song speaks to those who have ever seen somebody somewhere and immediately thought (due to appearance, or any other characteristic) ""they and I should be together"". This then sparks a fantasy in this person's mind creating this perfect world with that person seen, only to find out, in reality, that person is with someone else. (In the song I play the person seen, in the fantasy perspective. I'm a little ugly, so it's a comedic role :D)
Market Potential
Already, the song has major commercial appeal, and has more potential to hit the commercial market than any other song I have written. Through my current network, and the production company that will produce the final record, this song is already planned to be shopped out immediately to outlets ranging from TV Networks to Record labels. (Please Note: Those of you who are familiar with the music industry know that production companies will not waste their time shopping out a song without potential.)
Where Will Your Money Go?
The Final Recording- I have always used my own studio (Studio Red CT) to record all preliminary recordings, as well as some of the final mixes. Due to the love I have for this song and for it's potential, I wanted to make sure I use all the necessary tools possible to produce the best product. I signed a production deal from a studio in New York. I've wanted to record at this studio for a very long time, due to the expertise of those behind it, as well as the top of the line equipment used. Due to current contract litigation's, I am not allowed to publicly announce the name of the studio, but I will give supporters all the details personally once donations have been made. This session will range from ($1,000-$5,000) depending on the duration,what will be added to the song, and for paying the producer and engineer fairly. (Seeing as the maximum range is more than what i'm asking supporters for, I will personally be paying for whatever additional expenses arise such as travel, hospitality, etc.)
The Music Video- I've been wanting to record a music video ever since I wrote my first song! (Keep in mind, every time I write a song, I'm picturing the music video in my head as I write it.) The video for ""Number One"" already has a location in New York City, and has a set date to shoot. All I'm relying on my supporters for here is the videographer's payment ranging from $500-$1,500 depending on the amount of editing, time it takes to shoot, and how many additional employees are needed on set. (I will personally be paying for the space to rent.)
Marketing- Once the product is ready to distribute my marketing plan will take action. This will cover anything from booking shows, social media ads and promos, to printed press. The category of marketing is so extensive that the options could literally go on forever, Once the project is released, this becomes my life on a day to day basis, doing whatever I can to follow the plan and beyond to get the song heard by as many people as possible. I've set my rough marketing  budget to $2,000 but as I said above it's a very extensive category and can go on forever (meaning as much support as possible will be needed.)
I'm looking for as much support as possible to get ""Number One"" heard by the most people, and to take it as far as it can possibly go.  If you're reading this, I'm really counting on you, and everyone you know. The financial figures above very briefly demonstrate what goes into each category which is why I'm only asking my supporters to contribute what they can.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It's (relatively) easy to record music from home. All you need is a 1 or 2 channel interface (many people use a Focusrite Scarlett) and a guitar and/or halfway decent mic. My band Jean Shorts Jesus has an EP called Safe to Sleep, which was recorded entirely in our singer's bedroom. However, because we did not have access to drumset recording equipment, he had to use programmed MIDI drums, which are... less than ideal. As a music production major at my university, I have at best limited (3 hours a week ish, including setup and takedown) access to drumset recording equipment in the school studio, and everyone who is not a production major has at best no access. What people need is a convenient, accessible service to record drums for their musical projects. With this equipment, I can provide that service. It will also enable me to propel my own projects and bands forward (see below).</p>
<p>My dream is to make music for a living. I've been playing drums since the 7th grade, and I will continue to do so well after I die. Currently, I play in the OSU Jazz Band, the OSU drum line, Rhythm and Beavs (the OSU traveling athletics band), the OSU Wind Ensemble (as a concert percussionist), and several non-OSU bands like Jean Shorts Jesus (<a href=""https://jeanshortsjesus.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bandcamp</a>), a jazz-influenced indie punk group, and Church Ladies, a funk/RnB/Soul group.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>First and foremost, you as a user of the internet, regardless of whether you donate, will have access to all of the music I publish, because that's the way the music industry works now. The amount and quality of music I am able to publish is dependent on the success of this campaign.</p>
<p>The primary service I will be offering is simply this: you send me your track, with or without scratch drums, and I will record and send you back a quality recording of drums. I have a fair bit of experience recording drums, but I still have a lot to learn, and this will allow me to expand and develop my skill set. Depending on your preference, I can mix the drums myself and send you back a single stereo track, or I can send you each individual instrument track so that you can mix it or sample it as you desire. As a drummer with around 8 years of experience, I can (if desired) add extra flairs, fills, and frills to give your track that tasty edge.</p>
<p>I also offer drumset lessons (all ages and experience levels).</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>: the OSU drumline is phasing out some of their old equipment, some of which I will buy as soon as it becomes available. If you've never listened to marching percussion before, give <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Qph0CoTn8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this</a> a listen. As soon as I get a hold of that equipment, that is yet another flavor of percussive instrument which I will be able to offer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>The list of what I need to make this happen is surprisingly short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixer/audio interface. My eye currently is on the Allen and Heath ZED-24. This has more channels than I need for just recording my current drumset, but I want to leave room for growth in case I expand my kit or want to be able to record a full studio session.</li>
<li>Nice set of drum mics. The Shure PGA 7 ($500) is the mic kit you hear in the song overlaying my campaign video that the school studio owns. This is a solid all-purpose entry level mic kit. I would like to also buy a couple SM57s ($120 when bundled with a mic stand and cable) for auxiliary miking.</li>
<li>Set of 3 mic stands ($135) and one bass drum mic stand. If I got those SM57s bundled these wouldn't be extra.</li>
<li>Supplies to acoustically treat my basement. I will be DIYing everything to minimize cost, but my estimate to build 3 or 4 bass traps, thick foam or carpet to cover walls, and a couple baffles is $200.</li>
<li>Anything extra will probably go to getting some better drum heads (my current ones are pretty old)</li>
</ul>
<p>All told, this comes out to roughly $2000.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Music is basically free now. As consumers, we have the choice to support musicians and artists financially so that they can keep doing what they love. Every piece of music that I record will be publicly accessible via the wonderful thing we call the internet, regardless of whether you, the listener, pays for it or not. By contributing to this campaign you are directly supporting my musical career and enabling me to give you content. With a home studio the amount of music I will be able to create and publish is unparalleled.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The house in which I currently live is not conducive to the realization of this project, which is part of the reason that I'm so excited to move at the beginning of summer 2019. My new house will have a sizeable unfinished basement which will be my new studio's home. I will have my work cut out for me to soundproof and acoustically treat the space.</p>
<p>There is no chance this equipment will go to waste, unless I die or suffer some hypertraumatic injury which prevents me from playing drums ever again. I have ideas out the wazoo for what I want to accomplish with this, so even if I don't have clients who need drums recorded year-round, I will still be using it for my own bands and projects.</p>
<p>I am still a full-time student. Ideally this project will come to fruition at the beginning of Summer 2019 when I won't have to deal with school, but during the school year I may have less time to devote to it.</p>

<p>The goal of this campaign is literally a life-changer for me.<br/>I would like to fund my upcoming album ""Fragmentation"" however this time it would be completely different as I'd be able to completely focus on the album and not on ""oh sh*t am I going to starve?""<br/>On top of that, it would let me run a real advertising campaign, and not just sending it to the family on Facebook or begging my friends to give it a like.</p>If you help me with this campaign, you will literally change my life forever and I will never be thankful enough &lt;3</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So what are you planning to do with my money?</h3>

<ul>
<li>It will help me pay bills so that I can stay home and actually dedicate the <strong>whole</strong> day to music rather than 2-3 hours.</li>
<li>I will be finally able to run a real ad campaign with things such as posters, videos and most importantly online.</li>
<li>Making merch, which includes CD's, vinyl's and t-shirts.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of female artists from New York University looking for funding to create a music video for the song ""Glorious"" by Olivia Royal.  </p>
<p>“Glorious” is a song performed, written and produced by Clive Davis graduate Olivia Royal. It will be directed by Tisch Film graduate Emily Feng. This video highlights the feminine power within every woman and loosely retells the story of Adam and Eve through a feminist lens. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding to help cover basic production costs like </p>
<ul>
<li>Locations </li>
<li>Equipment rental</li>
<li>Costumes </li>
<li>Lighting</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Set design</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get the opportunity to support art by a group of talented young women and receive a credit in the video with your donation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In industries where most of the roles are occupied by men we are asserting our creative vision and defying expectations. By supporting this project you’ll be supporting young, female artists embarking on their careers. Each of the members on our team are actively challenging old paradigms about women’s roles in media by calling the shots both on screen and behind the scenes. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As our team is made up of college students and recent graduates we are all working to find our footing as artists. After searching for funding through school and scholarships and coming up short, we decided not to simply accept the notion of Do It Yourself but to choose to Do It Together. Art is a collaboration and we're inviting you to collaborate with us on the project. This video will be an exciting journey for our whole team and we want to create something that sparks that same kind of excitement in you. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't donate we would love if you would share this campaign and follow us to keep an eye out for upcoming projects by Olivia Royal, Emily Feng, Brittany Santiago, and Ana Fangayen.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are a group of female artists from New York University looking for funding to create a music video for the song ""Glorious"" by Olivia Royal.  
“Glorious” is a song performed, written and produced by Clive Davis graduate Olivia Royal. It will be directed by Tisch Film graduate Emily Feng. This video highlights the feminine power within every woman and loosely retells the story of Adam and Eve through a feminist lens. 

What We Need & What You Get
We need funding to help cover basic production costs like 

Locations 
Equipment rental
Costumes 
Lighting
Transportation
Set design

You’ll get the opportunity to support art by a group of talented young women and receive a credit in the video with your donation.

The Impact
In industries where most of the roles are occupied by men we are asserting our creative vision and defying expectations. By supporting this project you’ll be supporting young, female artists embarking on their careers. Each of the members on our team are actively challenging old paradigms about women’s roles in media by calling the shots both on screen and behind the scenes. 

Risks & Challenges
As our team is made up of college students and recent graduates we are all working to find our footing as artists. After searching for funding through school and scholarships and coming up short, we decided not to simply accept the notion of Do It Yourself but to choose to Do It Together. Art is a collaboration and we're inviting you to collaborate with us on the project. This video will be an exciting journey for our whole team and we want to create something that sparks that same kind of excitement in you. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't donate we would love if you would share this campaign and follow us to keep an eye out for upcoming projects by Olivia Royal, Emily Feng, Brittany Santiago, and Ana Fangayen.

Founded in 2009, we have performed in local shows throughout our city, small tours outside our city and even released a few singles.

<p>We have partnered with Grammy Award Winning and legendary producer and instrumentalistI Isaiah Sharkey to assist us in our latest production for our upcoming EP expected to release FALL 2021.</p>

<h3>""It's not that you want to sing, it's that you HAVE to sing"" -  my mentor, the Jazz &amp; Blues vocalist Joe Williams</h3>
<p>To  quote a famous comedian, ""I started out as a child"" - a professional child performer, that is. My performing career got sidetracked by 27 years in the U. S. Army (starting with the Vietnam War and ending with the Gulf War), but since retiring, I have returned to performing. I have traveled and entertained in the Boston/Cambridge area where I live, in New York City, all over the United States and in Europe.</p>
<p>Friends and fans everywhere I have performed have been encouraging me to make what I hope will be the first of many music CDs, After consulting with many of my friends who are musicians who have recorded and based on their experiences, it seems that $25,000 is what it would cost to record the music CD (paying the  musicians, paying for the recording rights, paying for a sound engineer, paying for time at a recording studio, etc.). Frankly, I do not have $25,000 extra in my bank account (heck, I'm a retired Army Sergeant on a pension!).</p>
<p>I'm not asking your financial help for living expenses (like I said, I have my pension) but rather for the opportunity to record and share my music. All the songs that will go on this first music CD (I hope there will be more CDs in the future) will be songs that have been written or co-written by friends, past and present.</p>

<h3><strong>Hello!</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Vladimir and I am a pianist, composer and music improviser.</p>
<p>I created this campaign to raise funds for the production of a very innovative (as well as effective!) songwriting, improvising and music composition instructional program resulting from many years of testing and personal teaching experience!</p>
<p>=-=-=</p>
<h3><strong>How Is This Course Different Than A YouTube Tutorial?</strong></h3>
<p>=-=-=</p>
<p>First of all, in this course I intend to reveal the true essence of how to create original music on a piano/keyboard (and other instruments).  This course is not about learning more theory methods or technique exercises. It will be focused entirely on cultivating genuine creativity and composition ability. Furthermore, the principles revealed can also be utilized on any instrument and thus can benefit a musician of any background or discipline. (Great if you're a guitarist, but dabble on the keys for example!)</p>
<p>Let it be known that this course is not only meant for classical or jazz musicians. It is equally (and perhaps even more so) <strong>applicable to electronic music producers, hip-hop beatmakers, pop songwriters and other genres of any modern music (rock and etc).</strong></p>
<p>Essentially, anyone who wants to create their own original melodies, songs or pieces would benefit enormously from this course!</p>
<p>The ultimate premise and intention with this project is to show aspiring and existing musicians alike that creating original songs and musical parts is <u>not</u> dependent on inherent talent or amount of theory knowledge.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, I will demonstrate that “musical talent” is actually available to anyone who can familiarize themselves with playing the piano/keyboard in perhaps a somewhat uncommon, yet highly intuitive and natural way.</p>
<p>The program will help one shape an <strong>effortless music composition approach</strong> that quickly turns idea impulses or melody fragments into completed written songs or (if you prefer) endless improvisational flows of captivating music and progressions!</p>
<p>There is nothing like this currently available. Quite serendipitously, the only reason I am able to share these musical insights today is due to a very unusual personal life journey and music education experience.</p>

<h3><strong>:: My Origin Story ::</strong></h3>
<p>=-=-=</p>
<p>The piano today is an ever-present life-long companion to me, yet things didn’t start out that way at all. </p>
<p>As a child, I found myself captivated by sounds and musical instruments, but because no one around me (not even my family, friends or relatives) shared my interest I never really gave music or piano much of a second thought. Sports and gaming quickly became my favorite childhood pastimes and although I listened to music all the time, the idea of playing piano seemed almost taboo to me. In that mindset, I didn’t want to learn the piano because it seemed like a lot of work for too little reward.</p>
<p>Then, when I was 21, a friend introduced me to a piece of music from Frederic Chopin and for some reason it suddenly ignited a very strong drive and desire in me to learn the piano, despite being at an age which many “experts” considered to be “too old and late for a pianist”.</p>
<p>At first, I dedicated myself to learning just that one first piece that inspired me, however... not longer after, I found myself excited enough to keep going with a second piece, then a third, and...</p>
<p>Before I knew it I found myself taking lessons with an internationally recognized piano teacher and enrolled at a top-level university music program.</p>
<p><strong>Until... I quit...</strong></p>
<p>All those lessons, methods, classes, theory assignments, textbooks, counter-point challenges... phewww..</p>
<p>At a certain point, I simply recognized I was training to become a musical academic and not at all the free, emotionally passionate and expressive creative pianist I dreamed to be.</p>
<p>After getting off that standard academic track, I decided to play the piano only for enjoyment and to me at first that meant jamming around and improvising in the way that I found exciting and fun.</p>
<p>No more exercises, methods, trainings, etc.</p>
<p>To my surprise... not that long after and without really trying, I found myself playing again and making progress on the piano far quicker and more effectively than I ever did during my academically-minded years.</p>
<p>Melodies, chord progressions, and other musical ideas seemed to flow faster, easier and more abundantly than ever before. It was something I couldn’t quite understand, until I took some time to reflect and really analyze what had changed.</p>
<p>After taking some time to really dive deep and noticing what was working and what was not, I was able to recognize certain, highly effective mindsets in my musical training.</p>
<p>Many of my study habits actually appeared to be rather uncommon amongst other musicians, yet I found them to be the very core reason behind my creative dexterity and abundance. </p>
<p>That self-study as well as sessions upon sessions of experience working with my own students privately has now given me the confidence and enthusiasm to share this on a more public level! </p>
<p><strong>This is what this course and program is all about!</strong></p>

The piano today is an ever-present life-long companion to me, yet things didn’t start out that way at all. 
As a child, I found myself captivated by sounds and musical instruments, but because no one around me (not even my family, friends or relatives) shared my interest I never really gave music or piano much of a second thought. Sports and gaming quickly became my favorite childhood pastimes and although I listened to music all the time, the idea of playing piano seemed almost taboo to me. In that mindset, I didn’t want to learn the piano because it seemed like a lot of work for too little reward.
Then, when I was 21, a friend introduced me to a piece of music from Frederic Chopin and for some reason it suddenly ignited a very strong drive and desire in me to learn the piano, despite being at an age which many “experts” considered to be “too old and late for a pianist”.
At first, I dedicated myself to learning just that one first piece that inspired me, however... not longer after, I found myself excited enough to keep going with a second piece, then a third, and...
Before I knew it I found myself taking lessons with an internationally recognized piano teacher and enrolled at a top-level university music program.
Until... I quit...
All those lessons, methods, classes, theory assignments, textbooks, counter-point challenges... phewww..
At a certain point, I simply recognized I was training to become a musical academic and not at all the free, emotionally passionate and expressive creative pianist I dreamed to be.
After getting off that standard academic track, I decided to play the piano only for enjoyment and to me at first that meant jamming around and improvising in the way that I found exciting and fun.
No more exercises, methods, trainings, etc.
To my surprise... not that long after and without really trying, I found myself playing again and making progress on the piano far quicker and more effectively than I ever did during my academically-minded years.
Melodies, chord progressions, and other musical ideas seemed to flow faster, easier and more abundantly than ever before. It was something I couldn’t quite understand, until I took some time to reflect and really analyze what had changed.
After taking some time to really dive deep and noticing what was working and what was not, I was able to recognize certain, highly effective mindsets in my musical training.
Many of my study habits actually appeared to be rather uncommon amongst other musicians, yet I found them to be the very core reason behind my creative dexterity and abundance. 
That self-study as well as sessions upon sessions of experience working with my own students privately has now given me the confidence and enthusiasm to share this on a more public level! 
This is what this course and program is all about!

<p><strong>ARTIST:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CARLENE GRAHAM - Singer / Songwriter / Producer</strong></p>
<p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>For the last 2.5 years, I have been touring worldwide with the Spanish musical Forever King Of Pop - endorsed by Latoya &amp; Jermaine Jackson via The Jackson Family Foundation. We toured Spain, France, Germany &amp; Mexico twice. Due to Covid-19 the tour has been postponed until 2021/2022. </p>
<p>With 21 years of professional experience working with some of the biggest names in the music industry such as Madonna, Shakira &amp; Dionne Warwick, some of my performance highlights to date, include: Singing acapella at The House of Commons in London at the Black Women Mean Business Convention for MP Diane Abbott (2001), Tsunami Appeal Concert at The Royal Albert Hall (2004), ""Stars In Their Eyes"" on ITV as Gloria Gaynor (2004), Primavera Sound of Barcelona (2006), Glastonbury with Spiritualised (2007), Wizink Centre Madrid - Forever King of Pop (2018), Centro Cultural Teatro 1 CDMX, Mexico (2019), Casino de Paris (2019) &amp; Verti Music Hall, Berlin (2020) to name a few!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2020 has seen very little work since February, &amp; cancelled bookings until further notice. Like so many artists out of work, I have had to create &amp; establish a new way of life. So during lockdown I wrote, recorded &amp; produced <u>3 albums &amp; 2 singles from home</u> - with Errol Ross on Music Production. </strong></p>
<p>We are using basic equipment to do this. Our gig equipment to be exact. We have had to utilise our (old) iMac, Mackie Mixer, Focusrite Scarlett, Shure SM58, &amp; HK Speakers, combined with our music &amp; production skills, to create :</p>

After Indiegogo took their cut I ultimately netted $6,590.56 of my goal of $15,575. Turns out crowdfunding during a worldwide pandemic is hard! </p><p>But, I'm powering forward. This record will be made. May have to make some adjustments along the way, but it will happen. </p><p>I pretty much laid it all out in <a href=""https://igg.me/at/kevinmontgomeryGOODTHING/x/5641316#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the explanation of Good Thing in the first campaign</a>, so I'll refer you to that if you are just catching up with this. I probably said too much! So, check it out if you have any questions. </p><p>The two month campaign was tough, but enlightening.

After Indiegogo took their cut I ultimately netted $6,590.56 of my goal of $15,575. Turns out crowdfunding during a worldwide pandemic is hard! But, I'm powering forward. This record will be made. May have to make some adjustments along the way, but it will happen. I pretty much laid it all out in the explanation of Good Thing in the first campaign, so I'll refer you to that if you are just catching up with this. I probably said too much! So, check it out if you have any questions. The two month campaign was tough, but enlightening.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Art Joslin, and I am seeking funding to record my 4th CD. This project, titled ""But Not For Me - Love Songs from the Great American Songbook"" will feature 10 songs that will warm your heart, and remind us why we fell in love. Originally trained as an opera singer, I have been singing these songs for nearly 40 years. Before my wife passed from cancer in 2017, we would perform many of these songs together (she played piano), and sometimes we danced until the early hours. She is the reason I want to record some of our favorites.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding for this project is $18,000. Here is what that money will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Studio Time</strong> - Finding the right studio to record a project of this size is difficult. Luckily, there are two studios in Michigan - 1 in Ann Arbor, and 1 in Detroit, that can provide the right atmosphere for us. A minimum of two days in the studio for tracks, and at least one day for vocals (maybe two).</li>
<li>
<strong>World-Class Studio Musicians</strong> - 15 of the finest professional session musicians Detroit and Ann Arbor have to offer will be recording this project. Assembling a Big Band for 5 of the 10 songs is not cheap. The other 5 songs require a jazz combo.</li>
<li>
<strong>​Phenomenal Arranger &amp; Music Director</strong> - I have hired one of the best jazz arrangers in the Midwest to bring fresh musical ideas to these great standards.</li>
<li>
<strong>A Great Engineer</strong> - not every engineer can run a studio and mix these type of songs. One that is well-versed with jazz, and songs from the Great American Songbook is needed to give the project a polished finish.</li>
<li>
<strong>Secure Publisher Rights</strong> - permission must be obtained for licensing the recording of someone else's work. <u>This is expensive</u>. It is unethical to use someone else's musical work without proper compensation. This is controlled by BMI and ASCAP.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mixing the Project</strong> - It takes an acute ear to mix a project of this size and style to get the right balance between the instruments and the vocals. Mixing includes additional studio time with the engineer, music director, and me.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mastering</strong> - When the final project is mixed, it must be mastered before it can be sent off to a CD replication house. This requires even more studio time, the engineer, and the music director.</li>
<li>
<strong>Graphic Design &amp; Photo Shoot</strong> - A graphic designer will design a pleasing cover and jacket using all new photos specifically for this CD project.</li>
<li>
<strong>CD Replication</strong> - The master is sent to a replication house for replication, printing, and packaging.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Please allow me to give you a little history of why I love these songs so much, and why I would love to record these 10 songs and share them with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I met my beautiful wife in the summer of 1983 and the thunderbolt hit me. Not only was she a sweetheart, but she was one of the finest pianists I've ever known. Classically trained in piano, and I in voice, we performed together for nearly 35 years. One of the pure joys of my life.</p>
<p>Tragically, she passed away of cancer in 2017, silencing a talent and gift that was truly from God.</p>
<p>We shared a love of jazz standards and songs from The Great American Songbook. We danced together as much as possible to these great songs of the greatest generation.</p>
<p>So, I decided to record a CD of ten songs from that very Songbook. These are some of my and my wife's favorites by composers such as Hoagy Carmichael, Johnny Mercer, George &amp; Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Duke Ellington, and others. They represent songs that generate, for me, memories and feelings of love lost, dancing together, and of course, heartbreak.</p>
<p>Over the years, people have written me emails, notes, letters, and Facebook posts asking when I was going to record these songs. </p>
</li>
<li><p>I've had years of experience singing back-up vocals and making recordings in recording studios. I know my way around the studio, and live performance, so you won't have to worry about wasted time and money!</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, the challenge will be to fund this project. Here are the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fully Funded</strong> - The project gets started with a tentative completion date no later than May 1st, 2020 (at the  very latest).</li>
<li>
<strong>Over Funded</strong> - If the project is over-funded, I will use the excess funds to add a few musicians to the mix, have more CD's replicated, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Partially Funded</strong> - I would use whatever funds are available to begin the project. I would try to find more ways to fund the project to it's completion (work at BK, Taco Bell, sell apples on the corner, etc.).</li>
<li>
<strong>Not Funded</strong> - or not funded enough to start . . . I really hope this doesn't happen???!!!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Spread the Word</strong> - Get the word out to as many as you can. Please share this campaign on Social Media and tell your friends.</li></ul>
<p>Thank you so much for your consideration and God Bless You!</p>

<h3>20% rise in domestic violence in 2020<br/>Let's help the charities in helping victims!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>I'm Lilac Sheer, a singer-songwriter, musician &amp; vlogger. I've released 4 albums and always saw my creation as a tool to convey messages of empowerment and personal development.  I also vlog several times a week on my YouTube channel, discussing similar topics.</p>
<p>As a child I knew all too well the feeling of helplessness, never knowing who would bear the consequences of laughing too hard, interfering too much or not doing enough. And when the consequence isn't necessarily related to what we do or don’t do, the lesson we take with us is that we are always at fault, never good enough, and always deserving of the disrespect, which leads us in a vicious cycle to seek the same emotional or physical treatment in future relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p>In these tumultuous times, while we rely on the home, our safe haven, to protect us from the virus threat outdoors, in other homes, victims of domestic violence abuse find themselves trapped 24/7 under the same roof with their perpetraor and women and mothers are being murdered at an unprecedented rate.  The UN recently reported a 20% increase in domestic violence cases since the onset of Covid-19, with organisations &amp; rescue shelters struggling under the load and are in urgent need of donations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603633691/qtuwfpakvpdxrepv3b7f.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/><strong>What can we do together?</strong></p>
<p>With your support, we'll release next month a protest song &amp; animation video aimed at raising awareness and generating donations in light of upcoming International Domestic Violence Awareness Day [November 25th]. This is a not-profit project, whereby the song and videoclip will be used as a fundraising tool for Solace Women's Aid, an organisation dedicated to rescuing women and children suffering from domestic violence and enabling them to enter a new life by providing asylum, shelter, professional care and vocational training.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What is your part as a supporter?</strong></p>
<p>With your support, I'd be able to finalise post-production, publish the song and produce a music video. As an events performer I've had no income since March, yet I wholeheartedly believe that the timing is right and crucial for this project to see the light of day, in order to create a social impact and moral boost.  <u>You are an essential part of this project</u> - Together we will finalise the following: • Mix • Master • Video clip • Distribution • Promotion</p>

<p><br/><strong>What is our message to the community?</strong></p>
<p>Let's say no more.  Let's stand together as a society and say enough.  And while governments are urging musicians to change profession - let's remind everyone the power of artistic expression in changing hearts &amp; minds and it's ability to create real change, even  (and maybe even more so) when times are hard.</p>
<p><br/><strong>I want to release the song with you!  What's the next step?</strong></p>
<p>All you have to do to help release the song &amp; music video, is to purchase one or more of the perks from the campaign list.  <u>Remember - Any donation, large or small - Is viable &amp; important</u>. If you order any of my CDs - these will be sent to you immediately as the campaign ends (throughout December) so it won't take long to receive your goodies.</p>
<p>After purchasing your perks, invite your friends to take part in this exciting process with us - Together, we'll be able to do a real service for the community and make a difference.</p>

<p>This is Omar Tyree, the New York Times bestselling author who used to be the youngest author, writing and selling books in my early 20s over 20 years. Now I’m The Oldhead, who still has a lot to say about what’s going on in our community. Problem is, folks don’t have time to read like they used to. Fortunately for me, I understand how to write and deliver poetry and music, which I’ve been doing behind the scenes for a lonnnnggg time. Now I’m coming back to my vocals skills and roots with an incredible third album, ""The Oldhead Just Spoke"". Why? Obviously, the youth culture has now taken over popular music. Problem is, they’re not saying anything that still needs to be said to our people. I plan to change that with a new mission and a stable of young artists. So for all The Believers of Positive Power Music (PPM), I offer you an opportunity to purchase 18 incredible song for digital download, a physical CD, have you name listed in the foldout booklet, include a recorded vocal shot-out on an appreciation record, advertise your business inside the booklet, purchase and sell 50 CD copies of your own, and the grand finale, co-write and produce one of the featured songs with me.</p>
<p>""The Olhead Just Spoke"", is not just an album, it’s a movement to get our young people to respect the funky truth of age and wisdom. Then I can write, produce and develop more meaningful content for my younger artists. But don’t just take my word it for it, click on the Free song link and listen to an inspirational track yourself - ""Make Em Believe"" featuring my 1st young protégé, Ana Morris . And learn to support Positive Power Music for years to come!</p>

<p>Europe, for the genre I produce music iN, plays a main role and I would love to understand, learn, create, explore and discover on an international level and by that contribute towards music as much as my culture.

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>For those who don’t know me, I am Vixen Noir, a Los Angeles-based singer, songwriter, recording and performance artist, producer, director, as well as a performance empowerment coach. I’ve been a lifelong Artist but only burst onto the music scene in 2013 with my debut single, Dangerous, finally in pursuit of my dream to be a SupaStar entertainer who empowers LGBTQ, POC, Women and Girls worldwide. I have since released an EP, several singles including my latest, MothaFucka, and wowed audiences from San Francisco to Sydney Australia.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years, I’ve experienced a profound renaissance as a Black, Queer, Woman, Activist and Artist. I am now ready to share my journey through new music and videos that I hope will inspire self-love, love and respect for others, courage, healing, transformation, and the acceptance and celebration of gender and sexual diversity. I call this new endeavor, The ‘Rebirth of Vixen’ Project. I’ve divided it into two parts. PART 1: MothaFucka Remix Project and PART 2: A new 7-song EP, titled ‘Rebirth’.</p>
<p>PART 1: MothaFucka Remix Project, is the focus of this campaign. I am finally answering the call to rebirth my latest single, MothaFucka, as a club anthem remix, which pays homage to Black Transwomen while giving them much needed visibility. The remix will be produced by Jasmine Infiniti, a Black transwoman DJ/Producer, and feature Genuwine Beauty, a Black transwoman rap artist. (Pictured below lft to rt)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535426292/xqxinbuih2sgwc7xrao9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>An accompanying music video will feature a cast of 8 Black Transwomen, uphold them in the most honorable and authentic light, and pay tribute to those who are no longer with us. Through this project we hope to also inspire the elimination of transphobic hatred and ignorance. So far, Fern Rose Mitchell, Dayna Catchings, Melanie Loraine Bryant, Kaityanna Delarosé Phillips, Jerri Lee and Chela Demuir-Cartier are confirmed to feature in the music video. (Pictured below top to bottom, lft to rt) We are in the process of securing the remaining 2 cast members.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534843694/iyzgwlhox7cschfgbepl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why make the MF Remix Project a platform for Black Transwomen voices? </strong></p>
<p>If there’s one thing I’m deeply passionate about, it’s my Black LGBTQ family! And my Trans Sisters, for whatever reason, have always held a very special place in my heart! And it breaks my heart and angers me, the alarming rate at which Black Transwomen are harmed and murdered in this country! Startling! Through this project, I want to provide an opportunity for these women to say whatever they need to or want to say to the world. I want society to see and respect Black Transwomen as magnificent and brilliant human beings with valuable contributions to make to this planet like everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p><strong>(PLEASE NOTE: To help us meet our pre-production and Sep 8 shoot day costs of $3113, we gladly welcome contributions via PayPal to <a href=""mailto:vixen_noir@hotmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vixen_noir@hotmail.com</a> and Venmo to @Vixen-Noir. This will allow us more immediate access to funding, and ensure a successful project. THANK YOU.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>All we need to fulfill this project is $5,500. </strong>After much research, negotiation, juggled schedules and more I found the most reasonable resources possible (from super discounted to volunteer) and a shoot date that fits everybody’s schedule! Whew! September 8, 2018 is the day! We have everything in place and ready to go. Now all we need is your support to make it happen. From $5 to $5000, every amount counts! Your patronage will help cover the following costs:</p>
<p><strong>For the Remix </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DJ/Producer (to remix the song)</li>
<li>Artist fees for the feature rap artists</li>
<li>Recording studio time</li>
<li>Mastering the finished remix</li>
<li>Cover art design</li>
<li>Distribution (online stores and music sites incl. iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, iHeart Radio, etc.)</li>
<li>Promotion (online and release party)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the Music Video</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Video Producer/Cameraman/Editor</li>
<li>Stipends for 8 video cast members</li>
<li>Space rental (pre-shoot workshop &amp; day of shoot green/dressing room)</li>

<li>Supplies/Materials (Poster boards, markers, glue, first aid kit, etc.)</li>
<li>Costumes (incl. a crown for each cast member and additional costume items and accessories)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PERKS!</strong></p>
<p>To show our appreciation, we have some great perks lined up! Downloads of the remix and/or the music video before released to the world; special limited design MothaFucka T-shirts, behind-the-scenes photos of the cast in action, and more! For a $5000 contribution, you can be the Executive Producer of this project, be credited as so on the remix and the music video, along with other special perks. And for $300 you can sponsor a cast member to be in the music video, ensuring her voice is heard; including costume needs, local roundtrip transportation to and from shoot, meals/beverages and a stipend. How awesome is that?! <strong>MORE PERKS COMING!</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT WE HOPE FOR</strong></p>
<p>With the current climate of ongoing police brutality, discrimination, institutional and societal racism and transphobia, hate crimes and the alarming number of Black transwomen being murdered, it is our hope that the MothaFucka Remix Project can make a difference. It is our hope that through this project, we are able to reflect and uplift the brilliance, beauty, strength and power of Black Transwomen and resonate the message, #<cite>BlackTransWomensLivesMatter</cite>, loud and clear to the world!</p>
<p>We are all 200% committed to this project, and would be ecstatic to have you be a part of this journey with us! If we are not able to raise the entire $5500, the quality, the content and the participation of all who are committed to this project will be greatly compromised and we may not be able to effectively bring it to fruition, if at all.</p>
<p>However, if you aren’t able to contribute at this time, don’t fret! SPREADING THE WORD is a HUGE help. Indiegogo makes it really easy for you to share this campaign with your community via social media and email. I know that if we all pull together in strength and numbers, we will be successful!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>With love and gratitude…</p>

I call this new endeavor, The ‘Rebirth of Vixen’ Project. I’ve divided it into two parts. PART 1: MothaFucka Remix Project and PART 2: A new 7-song EP, titled ‘Rebirth’.
PART 1: MothaFucka Remix Project, is the focus of this campaign. I am finally answering the call to rebirth my latest single, MothaFucka, as a club anthem remix, which pays homage to Black Transwomen while giving them much needed visibility. The remix will be produced by Jasmine Infiniti, a Black transwoman DJ/Producer, and feature Genuwine Beauty, a Black transwoman rap artist. (Pictured below lft to rt)

An accompanying music video will feature a cast of 8 Black Transwomen, uphold them in the most honorable and authentic light, and pay tribute to those who are no longer with us. Through this project we hope to also inspire the elimination of transphobic hatred and ignorance. So far, Fern Rose Mitchell, Dayna Catchings, Melanie Loraine Bryant, Kaityanna Delarosé Phillips, Jerri Lee and Chela Demuir-Cartier are confirmed to feature in the music video. (Pictured below top to bottom, lft to rt) We are in the process of securing the remaining 2 cast members.

Why make the MF Remix Project a platform for Black Transwomen voices? 
If there’s one thing I’m deeply passionate about, it’s my Black LGBTQ family! And my Trans Sisters, for whatever reason, have always held a very special place in my heart! And it breaks my heart and angers me, the alarming rate at which Black Transwomen are harmed and murdered in this country! Startling! Through this project, I want to provide an opportunity for these women to say whatever they need to or want to say to the world. I want society to see and respect Black Transwomen as magnificent and brilliant human beings with valuable contributions to make to this planet like everybody else.
WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
(PLEASE NOTE: To help us meet our pre-production and Sep 8 shoot day costs of $3113, we gladly welcome contributions via PayPal to vixen_noir@hotmail.com and Venmo to @Vixen-Noir. This will allow us more immediate access to funding, and ensure a successful project. THANK YOU.)
All we need to fulfill this project is $5,500. After much research, negotiation, juggled schedules and more I found the most reasonable resources possible (from super discounted to volunteer) and a shoot date that fits everybody’s schedule! Whew! September 8, 2018 is the day! We have everything in place and ready to go. Now all we need is your support to make it happen. From $5 to $5000, every amount counts! Your patronage will help cover the following costs:
For the Remix 

DJ/Producer (to remix the song)
Artist fees for the feature rap artists
Recording studio time
Mastering the finished remix
Cover art design
Distribution (online stores and music sites incl. iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, iHeart Radio, etc.)
Promotion (online and release party)

For the Music Video

Video Producer/Cameraman/Editor
Stipends for 8 video cast members
Space rental (pre-shoot workshop & day of shoot green/dressing room)
Craft services (food & beverages for pre-shoot workshop & day of shoot)
Supplies/Materials (Poster boards, markers, glue, first aid kit, etc.)
Costumes (incl. a crown for each cast member and additional costume items and accessories)

PERKS!
To show our appreciation, we have some great perks lined up! Downloads of the remix and/or the music video before released to the world; special limited design MothaFucka T-shirts, behind-the-scenes photos of the cast in action, and more! For a $5000 contribution, you can be the Executive Producer of this project, be credited as so on the remix and the music video, along with other special perks. And for $300 you can sponsor a cast member to be in the music video, ensuring her voice is heard; including costume needs, local roundtrip transportation to and from shoot, meals/beverages and a stipend. How awesome is that?! MORE PERKS COMING!
THE IMPACT WE HOPE FOR
With the current climate of ongoing police brutality, discrimination, institutional and societal racism and transphobia, hate crimes and the alarming number of Black transwomen being murdered, it is our hope that the MothaFucka Remix Project can make a difference. It is our hope that through this project, we are able to reflect and uplift the brilliance, beauty, strength and power of Black Transwomen and resonate the message, #BlackTransWomensLivesMatter, loud and clear to the world!
We are all 200% committed to this project, and would be ecstatic to have you be a part of this journey with us! If we are not able to raise the entire $5500, the quality, the content and the participation of all who are committed to this project will be greatly compromised and we may not be able to effectively bring it to fruition, if at all.
However, if you aren’t able to contribute at this time, don’t fret! SPREADING THE WORD is a HUGE help. Indiegogo makes it really easy for you to share this campaign with your community via social media and email. I know that if we all pull together in strength and numbers, we will be successful!
Thank you.
With love and gratitude…

<p><u><strong>Beat 106 Scotland</strong></u></p>
<p>In November 1999 Scotland's Music Revolution playing Today's Best Music was launched. It was the station that featured some of Scotland's best home grown DJs and produced some of the most memorable club nights in Scotland.</p>
<p>How do I know ? I was there. My name is Richard Wilkinson and I helped launch Beat 106 back in 1999. It's time to bring the hugely influential brand back into the Scottish music and radio landscape.</p>
<p>This campaign is to bring the station back initially as an app and online based radio station so that everyone can listen to the station non just in Central Scotland but everywhere and anywhere.</p>
<p>Whether you were there at Club 106 nights across Scotland's premier clubs listening to Trevor Reilly, Stevie Kerr, Lisa Littlewood, Paul Mendez, Colin Tevendale, Simon Foy, Scott Mackay and many more. Whether you were at T in the Park listening to the Beat Bus in the campsite. Whether you were at Love Beat Live or any of the live events that Beat 106 hosted, it was THE radio brand that defined a generation of young Scots before it was sold (to the English !). Scotland needs it radio identity back and Beat 106 will be the station for all dance music lovers but we need you to make it happen !</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>Building a radio station sadly costs money but it needn't cost the earth:</p>
<p>We would like £25,000 to build a station that includes building the app to listen to the station and to design website for you to listen to it too. We need equipment, a play out system and the requisite technology to get that radio station on air and into your ears ! Any extra money raised will go to live events we have planned through 2020 and beyond. If we raise a massive amount more than the £25,000 target we'll look to developing a basic permanent studio at a location in Central Scotland so that we can have guests, live DJs and so much more.</p>
<p>Everyone that contributes £30 or more gets 1 invite to our live launch event sometime in Q2 2020 at a time and location tbc.</p>
<p>Everyone that contributes £50 or more gets 2 invites to our live launch event sometime in Q2 2020 at a time and location tbc.</p>
<p>Everyone that contributes £100 or more gets 2 invite to all Beat 106 Scotland's proposed live events in 2020.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates £1000 or more and if the target reaches £100,000 or more will get a studio tour at some point in the future after the station launches. They will also get 2 invites for life to every Beat 106 Scotland event.</p>
<p>This radio station will go ahead whether the target is reached or not. All contributions are welcome and greatly received no matter how big or small.</p>
<p>Contributors who wish to go to our live events must be 18 years or over or fulfil the age requirements and restrictions of the requisite live music venues.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></p>
<p>Beat 106 made a massive social impact when launched in 1999 at it's peak it was listened to by over 500,000 listeners (Source RAJAR):</p>
<p>A radio station that you can take with you wherever you go.</p>
<p>A radio station made in Scotland, based in Scotland, with Scottish owners.</p>
<p>A music format that is no longer delivered on traditional analogue radio in Scotland.</p>
<p>A radio station without the same regulations that a traditional analogue station has.</p>
<p><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>At the moment it's just one person planning on delivering this project. With your support I'd love to be able to hire live presenters (some of the DJs mentioned above and more), producers, sales staff. The original Beat 106 launched with a budget of nearly £2 million and was sold to a radio group in London less than year after launch for just under £34 million. It's a costly and complicated business launching and running a radio station but from small acorns we'll build an essential radio service for Scotland's dance music loving audience.</p>

<p><i>Beth McKenna Jazz Orchestra is premiering an exciting brand new suite (seven movements) in March 2016. An original jazz-rock fusion work written by McKenna, ""Home: Montréal"" features an 18 piece ensemble of some of Montreal's most in demand and versatile musicians, including Grand Prix du Jazz 2015 (FIJM) winner, <b>Rachel Therrien. </b></i></p>
<p><i>The suite reflects on 7 inspirational, iconic and influential locations in the city. We need your help to record all seven movements (7 tracks) so we may record the full suite to share, instead of a 4-track incomplete-suite studio demo recording to give to help get this work shared internationally in conjunction with our live premiere on March 24th, 2016! <br/></i></p>
<p>We've decided that we need to surpass the requirements of our grant project (4 tracks for the CALQ), since that would produce an incomplete CD, so we are working via crowdfunding to record the remainder of the music written for this project, still releasing it to the public for easy access (free platforms) as of March 24th, 2016. Without your help, this can't happen!</p>

<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">ABOUT THE PROJECT ---------</span></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">MONTREAL. One of the most incredible cities in the world. Bilingual,<br/>multicultural, historically colourful and unique its own from any other place on the planet. Inspirational and the driving force for Beth McKenna Jazz Orchestra's (BMJO) newest work, ""HOME: MONTRÉAL"".</i></span></span></h3>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">Photo credit - B. McKenna</i></span></span></div> <p>Moving forward from our first non-commercial demo recording CD, ""START"", which was inspired mainly by life experiences and transitional periods, Home: Montréal is a completely new work that observes Montréal in a very unique perspective and illustrates it as seven jazz-rock soundscapes of the city, in dynamic, energetic and epic music of multiple genres that changes and transforms throughout each movement. </p>
<p><i>The music of Home: Montréal brings Montreal via very colourful and textural musical illustration to the concert hall and listeners anywhere in the world. With 7 inspirational and very unique places in the city represented, listeners all over the world can get explore the incredible city from McKenna's music and soundscapes in ""Home: Montréal"".</i></p>
<p>BMJO is recording our 2nd project, ""Home: Montreal"", over an hour of epic, adventurous contemporary-jazz/cinematic jazz music for 18-piece jazz orchestra, bringing together many of Canada's greatest upcoming professional musicians based in Montreal, QC. </p>
<p>The piece is composed through seven movements (musical chapters), developed and interpreted by Montreal musicians and performers, but the piece is challenging, intense, demanding and one that stands out from other jazz orchestra literature in such a unique way, with driving indie rock, jazz, pop, groove and popular music influences.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b><i>How would we describe ""Home: Montreal""? </i></b>- Home: Montreal is inspired by Darcy James Argue's Brooklyn Babylon in concept---being a multi-movement work that illustrates a perspective artistically through music. Home: Montreal breaks away from the ""norms"" in big band, away from the ""old-school"" traditional and classic sound of Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Glenn Miller, towards pulling in influences of rock, indie, fusion, groove, R&amp;B, soul and modern contemporary jazz. Beth's compositions are written to reach wider audiences, creating greater demand for jazz as a genre and sustainability for jazz musicians. </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><i>The purpose of Home: Montreal is to create a piece that takes the listener to the city without leaving the concert hall, and illustrates the city for any listener, regardless having ever visited Montreal. The music is open to interpretation, and BMJO's development of this work makes it an authentically Montréal performance, 100%, by the professional artists who live and thrive here.</i></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span><br/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The music, which changes and evolves dramatically as an adventure through each movement, thrills listeners and engages them with changing through-composition and soaring textures throughout the work... each movement a multi-section work of its own. Beth employs the use of electronics, effects, modern non-traditional jazz orchestra writing practices and new contemporary techniques to further extend her writing palette in this work. Beth's writing style is very unique, pushing her musicians in their abilities, their stylistic and artistic performance and in their work together as an ensemble, many of them working together for the first time.</span></p>
<p><b><i>We've run into a VERY CHALLENGING situation with this project, and we need to ask for YOUR help!!---  The work for developing, composing and producing ""Home: Montréal"" has evolved and developed into so much more so quickly from it's initial conception and planning, to the full seven movements that it is today, that we need to ask the public for their support so we can present this project and share it with audiences as a full work, in it's full format!</i></b></p>
<p><i>Our </i>c<i>urrent project budget </i><b><i>allows only for one day </i></b><i>of recording in the studio, </i>and our newest work, ""Home: Montréal"", will <b><i>need at absolute minimum, two days of studio for the full ensemble in order to record all seven tracks!</i></b> (This doesn't include separate small sessions to track overdubs and some of the solos if needed!) </p>

<h3>Background Information on BMJO and ""Home: Montréal""</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">BMJO was founded and established by Beth McKenna in June 2013 at the age of 23, soon after graduation from McGill's Schulich School of Music with a Bachelor of Music (Jazz Sax) and Bachelor of Education, at a crossroads and wanting to make a positive and big difference in the jazz community while establishing herself as a big band leader. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Now into this project's third year, we're looking for some extra funding and help from all of our supporters, to make our goals for our second project a full-length reality and deliver top-quality music and production quality that will take this project to the next level and beyond! </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The music is entirely written by McKenna, <i>and BMJO features musicians who are some of the most versatile and skilled players in the city---who perform professionally on a regular basis in symphony orchestras, musical theatre, jazz, rock, R&amp;B, improvisational music, classical, who are leaders of their own ensembles, writing and producing their own music.</i></span></li>

<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>This project was <b>funded by the Conseil des Arts et Lettres du Quebec's ""Grants for Up-and-Coming Artists: Music"" for TWO consecutive years</b> 2013-14 and 2014-15 in the ""Up-and-Coming Artists - Music - Creation/Exploration/ Research""</i> grants, but in <b><i>order to fully record this full suite</i></b> to the best it can possibly be this year and fully share it with everyone, <b><i>we need to record over two days (7 tracks totalling over one hour of music).<br/><br/></i></b></span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>This project's CALQ grant budget covers recording for one day---which only will allow time for 4 tracks to be recorded</b>... we want to instead record a full-length suite spanning the entire suite of ""Home: Montreal"", consisting of 7 tracks, over an hour of intense contemporary-jazz/fusion music for this all-Canadian, professional large jazz ensemble.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>This recording will be used for sharing and audience development with the public</b>, for promotion and booking of future concerts and festival bookings as well as future grant-funded initiatives and development for this ensemble. The recording will also be shared as much as possible worldwide on non-commercial platforms after March 24th, the premiere date for ""Home: Montréal"".</span></li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">This project is far from anything else that has been experienced in Montreal, and is a huge initiative in Montreal's arts and cultural scene. The project has involved many of Montreal's freelance musicians from different generations as rehearsal subs and collaborators, benefitting more than the 18 musicians involved in the core ensemble.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This project has received support, influence and mentorship from some of the best jazz artists in the Canadian and NYC communities, working with: </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">2x GRAMMY Nominee <b>Darcy James Argue</b> (Darcy James Argue's Secret Society)</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">2x JUNO award winner <b>Christine Jensen </b>(L'Orchestre Nationale de Jazz de Montréal, Christine Jensen Jazz Orchestra)</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">GRAMMY award winning composer <b>Jim McNeely</b> (Thad Jones, Mel Lewis Big Band, Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, BMI Composers Workshop) and </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Montreal's own <b>John Roney</b> (Effendi Jazzlab, John Roney Trio). </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've also received inspiration and influence from meeting in person with GRAMMY award winning bandleader and composer, </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Maria Schneider</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> as well in NYC in November 2015, discussing the project and writing. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My writing and the music in the project can be best described as a mix of contemporary jazz influences (Brad Mehldau, Christine Jensen, Maria Schneider, Pat Metheny, Keith Jarrett, Radiohead, Donny McCaslin), mixed together with popular music idioms to reach wider audiences and to take the listeners on an intense, driven and adventurous soundscapes visit through Montreal, without leaving the concert hall. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The music has drastically evolved and become much more focused, intense and colourful from START, where we grew as musicians, artists and performers--as well as myself as a composer and bandleader.</b>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With your help and financial support for this project, I'm really excited to make this a reality and tell the full story about Montreal through music, rather than a short, intense 3-4 track, dramatic cliffhanger of a recording, that cuts the ensemble short on showing and sharing the full compositional and very colourful, epic and adventurous work of Home: Montréal!</span>

</ul>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get--------------</h3> <ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>We need your support for funding support and the financial backing for a second session of recording studio time, so we can record and finish this project in its full setting.</b> </span></li></ul>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact----------------</h3> <p><i>This project is one that is unlike anything else in the music industry today, but ""Home: Montréal"" was initially inspired from <b>Darcy James Argue's Brooklyn Babylon</b> in general broad concept of programmatic music inspired by visual subjects and re-telling stories through music</i>. The idea behind our music is to engage our audiences, to fuse rock, pop, contemporary jazz, groove, world, and film music... with the big band! </p>
<p><b><i>OUR GOAL: We're taking Jazz Orchestra and modern contemporary jazz back to the mainstream</i></b>, performing music that is multiple-genres, reshaping jazz away from the classic tradition and building it as a popular genre! We want to make big band and jazz orchestras popular again, especially by sharing our music with listeners who typically follow mainstream artists. The band is an incredibly diverse cross-section of the Montréal jazz scene, featuring men and women, a split of anglophones/francophones and an all-Canadian roster of regular members of the band!</p>
<p>By contributing to this, BMJO's 2nd project, <b><i>not only will you be supporting Montreal artists, but helping with a monumental and very unique MONTREAL-based and inspired musical work to reach audiences worldwide.</i></b> Releasing the suite with only 4 tracks will leave it representing only ""half"" of the suite I originally wrote, inspired by 7 places in the city.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This project is one of the most innovative jazz projects that pushes towards the mainstream music community in Montreal, to date</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Is unique to the incredible city of Montreal, but the music of the project is so diverse, multifaceted and accessible/multi-genres, that it will attract audiences beyond those who are jazz listeners. </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Continued success after BMJO's first recording, ""START"", with a complete evolution in the ensemble's sound, Beth's writing and musical style.</span></li> <li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Will help to affect change in the jazz community and expand on jazz as a style and genre.</span></li>

MONTREAL'S PUBLIC REACTION TO BMJO'S FIRST RECORDING - ""START""!""TOP 3 - MONTREAL JAZZ ARTIST OF THE YEAR 2015"" - CAMUZ""TOP 5 - BEST JAZZ ACT - MONTREAL - 2015"" - CULTMTL
--------------------------------
Beth McKenna Jazz Orchestra is premiering an exciting brand new suite (seven movements) in March 2016. An original jazz-rock fusion work written by McKenna, ""Home: Montréal"" features an 18 piece ensemble of some of Montreal's most in demand and versatile musicians, including Grand Prix du Jazz 2015 (FIJM) winner, Rachel Therrien. 
The suite reflects on 7 inspirational, iconic and influential locations in the city. We need your help to record all seven movements (7 tracks) so we may record the full suite to share, instead of a 4-track incomplete-suite studio demo recording to give to help get this work shared internationally in conjunction with our live premiere on March 24th, 2016! 
We've decided that we need to surpass the requirements of our grant project (4 tracks for the CALQ), since that would produce an incomplete CD, so we are working via crowdfunding to record the remainder of the music written for this project, still releasing it to the public for easy access (free platforms) as of March 24th, 2016. Without your help, this can't happen!

ABOUT THE PROJECT ---------
MONTREAL. One of the most incredible cities in the world. Bilingual,multicultural, historically colourful and unique its own from any other place on the planet. Inspirational and the driving force for Beth McKenna Jazz Orchestra's (BMJO) newest work, ""HOME: MONTRÉAL"".

Photo credit - B. McKenna Moving forward from our first non-commercial demo recording CD, ""START"", which was inspired mainly by life experiences and transitional periods, Home: Montréal is a completely new work that observes Montréal in a very unique perspective and illustrates it as seven jazz-rock soundscapes of the city, in dynamic, energetic and epic music of multiple genres that changes and transforms throughout each movement. 
The music of Home: Montréal brings Montreal via very colourful and textural musical illustration to the concert hall and listeners anywhere in the world. With 7 inspirational and very unique places in the city represented, listeners all over the world can get explore the incredible city from McKenna's music and soundscapes in ""Home: Montréal"".
BMJO is recording our 2nd project, ""Home: Montreal"", over an hour of epic, adventurous contemporary-jazz/cinematic jazz music for 18-piece jazz orchestra, bringing together many of Canada's greatest upcoming professional musicians based in Montreal, QC. 
The piece is composed through seven movements (musical chapters), developed and interpreted by Montreal musicians and performers, but the piece is challenging, intense, demanding and one that stands out from other jazz orchestra literature in such a unique way, with driving indie rock, jazz, pop, groove and popular music influences.

How would we describe ""Home: Montreal""? - Home: Montreal is inspired by Darcy James Argue's Brooklyn Babylon in concept---being a multi-movement work that illustrates a perspective artistically through music. Home: Montreal breaks away from the ""norms"" in big band, away from the ""old-school"" traditional and classic sound of Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Glenn Miller, towards pulling in influences of rock, indie, fusion, groove, R&B, soul and modern contemporary jazz. Beth's compositions are written to reach wider audiences, creating greater demand for jazz as a genre and sustainability for jazz musicians. 
The purpose of Home: Montreal is to create a piece that takes the listener to the city without leaving the concert hall, and illustrates the city for any listener, regardless having ever visited Montreal. The music is open to interpretation, and BMJO's development of this work makes it an authentically Montréal performance, 100%, by the professional artists who live and thrive here.

The music, which changes and evolves dramatically as an adventure through each movement, thrills listeners and engages them with changing through-composition and soaring textures throughout the work... each movement a multi-section work of its own. Beth employs the use of electronics, effects, modern non-traditional jazz orchestra writing practices and new contemporary techniques to further extend her writing palette in this work. Beth's writing style is very unique, pushing her musicians in their abilities, their stylistic and artistic performance and in their work together as an ensemble, many of them working together for the first time.
We've run into a VERY CHALLENGING situation with this project, and we need to ask for YOUR help!!---  The work for developing, composing and producing ""Home: Montréal"" has evolved and developed into so much more so quickly from it's initial conception and planning, to the full seven movements that it is today, that we need to ask the public for their support so we can present this project and share it with audiences as a full work, in it's full format!
Our current project budget allows only for one day of recording in the studio, and our newest work, ""Home: Montréal"", will need at absolute minimum, two days of studio for the full ensemble in order to record all seven tracks! (This doesn't include separate small sessions to track overdubs and some of the solos if needed!)

Background Information on BMJO and ""Home: Montréal""

BMJO was founded and established by Beth McKenna in June 2013 at the age of 23, soon after graduation from McGill's Schulich School of Music with a Bachelor of Music (Jazz Sax) and Bachelor of Education, at a crossroads and wanting to make a positive and big difference in the jazz community while establishing herself as a big band leader. 


Now into this project's third year, we're looking for some extra funding and help from all of our supporters, to make our goals for our second project a full-length reality and deliver top-quality music and production quality that will take this project to the next level and beyond! 
The music is entirely written by McKenna, and BMJO features musicians who are some of the most versatile and skilled players in the city---who perform professionally on a regular basis in symphony orchestras, musical theatre, jazz, rock, R&B, improvisational music, classical, who are leaders of their own ensembles, writing and producing their own music.

This project was funded by the Conseil des Arts et Lettres du Quebec's ""Grants for Up-and-Coming Artists: Music"" for TWO consecutive years 2013-14 and 2014-15 in the ""Up-and-Coming Artists - Music - Creation/Exploration/ Research"" grants, but in order to fully record this full suite to the best it can possibly be this year and fully share it with everyone, we need to record over two days (7 tracks totalling over one hour of music).
This project's CALQ grant budget covers recording for one day---which only will allow time for 4 tracks to be recorded... we want to instead record a full-length suite spanning the entire suite of ""Home: Montreal"", consisting of 7 tracks, over an hour of intense contemporary-jazz/fusion music for this all-Canadian, professional large jazz ensemble.


This recording will be used for sharing and audience development with the public, for promotion and booking of future concerts and festival bookings as well as future grant-funded initiatives and development for this ensemble. The recording will also be shared as much as possible worldwide on non-commercial platforms after March 24th, the premiere date for ""Home: Montréal"".




This project is far from anything else that has been experienced in Montreal, and is a huge initiative in Montreal's arts and cultural scene. The project has involved many of Montreal's freelance musicians from different generations as rehearsal subs and collaborators, benefitting more than the 18 musicians involved in the core ensemble.



This project has received support, influence and mentorship from some of the best jazz artists in the Canadian and NYC communities, working with: 
2x GRAMMY Nominee Darcy James Argue (Darcy James Argue's Secret Society)
2x JUNO award winner Christine Jensen (L'Orchestre Nationale de Jazz de Montréal, Christine Jensen Jazz Orchestra)
GRAMMY award winning composer Jim McNeely (Thad Jones, Mel Lewis Big Band, Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, BMI Composers Workshop) and 
Montreal's own John Roney (Effendi Jazzlab, John Roney Trio). 

I've also received inspiration and influence from meeting in person with GRAMMY award winning bandleader and composer, Maria Schneider as well in NYC in November 2015, discussing the project and writing. 



My writing and the music in the project can be best described as a mix of contemporary jazz influences (Brad Mehldau, Christine Jensen, Maria Schneider, Pat Metheny, Keith Jarrett, Radiohead, Donny McCaslin), mixed together with popular music idioms to reach wider audiences and to take the listeners on an intense, driven and adventurous soundscapes visit through Montreal, without leaving the concert hall. 



The music has drastically evolved and become much more focused, intense and colourful from START, where we grew as musicians, artists and performers--as well as myself as a composer and bandleader.




With your help and financial support for this project, I'm really excited to make this a reality and tell the full story about Montreal through music, rather than a short, intense 3-4 track, dramatic cliffhanger of a recording, that cuts the ensemble short on showing and sharing the full compositional and very colourful, epic and adventurous work of Home: Montréal!


   What We Need & What You Get-------------- We need your support for funding support and the financial backing for a second session of recording studio time, so we can record and finish this project in its full setting. 
This means the money to pay the fees for hiring the 18 professional BMJO musicians for a second studio session (+$ for studio rental + engineers), plus the mixing, mastering, production and other fees associated with producing a recording project with 19 musicians! 


We want you (the audience and listeners!!!) to be a part of this!! We want to share this incredible experience with you as much as we possibly can!Your help and support, is the only way that Home: Montréal will become a full-length 7-track complete recording of the entire suite--- a project extension from the growth of our initial four tracks ---while simultaneously building awareness and support for this project!




PERKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!--------------

-------------The band and I are offering lots of cool BMJO project perks as a small thank you for your support, to help fund a second recording session to track this full suite---So we can share the whole thing with the Montreal public as well as listeners around the world!-------------

The Impact---------------- This project is one that is unlike anything else in the music industry today, but ""Home: Montréal"" was initially inspired from Darcy James Argue's Brooklyn Babylon in general broad concept of programmatic music inspired by visual subjects and re-telling stories through music. The idea behind our music is to engage our audiences, to fuse rock, pop, contemporary jazz, groove, world, and film music... with the big band! 
OUR GOAL: We're taking Jazz Orchestra and modern contemporary jazz back to the mainstream, performing music that is multiple-genres, reshaping jazz away from the classic tradition and building it as a popular genre! We want to make big band and jazz orchestras popular again, especially by sharing our music with listeners who typically follow mainstream artists. The band is an incredibly diverse cross-section of the Montréal jazz scene, featuring men and women, a split of anglophones/francophones and an all-Canadian roster of regular members of the band!
By contributing to this, BMJO's 2nd project, not only will you be supporting Montreal artists, but helping with a monumental and very unique MONTREAL-based and inspired musical work to reach audiences worldwide. Releasing the suite with only 4 tracks will leave it representing only ""half"" of the suite I originally wrote, inspired by 7 places in the city.

This project is one of the most innovative jazz projects that pushes towards the mainstream music community in Montreal, to date

Is unique to the incredible city of Montreal, but the music of the project is so diverse, multifaceted and accessible/multi-genres, that it will attract audiences beyond those who are jazz listeners. 

Continued success after BMJO's first recording, ""START"", with a complete evolution in the ensemble's sound, Beth's writing and musical style. Will help to affect change in the jazz community and expand on jazz as a style and genre.



Risks and Challenges----------------

Like any project, there are risks and challenges. 


  We have the networks, connections, presence and reputation on the Montreal and Canadian music scene to have this music distributed and to make a great impact!
If we fall short on funding, we will only be able to record an extra track or two to make it an incomplete recording of the suite to share, instead of all 7... means we would be doing a partial day in studio, etc. 



January 2015 interview with Richard Dagenais, Global Montreal Morning News



We have STRONG professional connections with major media and communications links for solid promotion of this project via social media, radio, TV, YouTube, BandCamp, online distribution, and internet radio. We have already started to develop a following for this ensemble. This suite is one that is intense, emotional, driving, epic, and adventurous, featuring some of Montreal's top artists in the jazz community, it will continue to receive airplay and a following. 




From START, BMJO was named in the Top 3 for ""Montreal Jazz Artist of the Year 2015"" - CAMUZ and Top 5 for ""Best Jazz Act"" - CultMtl. With Home: Montréal, we will only grow from here! Home: Montréal is a HUGE evolution from START, and we cannot wait to premiere this to the public!

Results - Montreal Jazz Artist of the Year 2015 - CAMUZ.ca 


Other Ways You Can Help Make This a Success!!! ---
Not able to contribute financially to help us get to our goal and record this as a full 7-track CD? There's still other ways in which you can help!  Share our video and this campaign on social media (Twitter, FB, Instagram, Pinterest, via e-mail, etc.)! We REALLY need the word out to get this finished!
Pass this along to media/bloggers/TV/Radio outlets (ESPECIALLY in Montreal and in the Canadian jazz scene!) to get the word out!
Plan to come to the March 24th premiere of Home: Montreal at L'Astral, and invite your friends to come with you! - TICKETS ARE AVAILABLE online and at L'Astral as of February 1st, 2016!


Thank you so much, we're grateful for the support in helping us reach our funding goal! We look forward to premiering ""Home: Montreal"" live, at L'Astral on March 24th, 2016!",9.0,2,"1 Campaign

<div>No Convention is a band that's about more than just making music.  There's been a lot of talk throughout the years about how rock is dying or dead, the music industry is an impenetrable fortress unless you are uber connected, blah, blah, blah.  We disagree, and we're gonna prove it!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We've released a new album, titled ""Welcome To Hollywood"", and it's  the most raw, honest, balls-out rock 'n roll music this world has seen in awhile.  We're taking the album on the road this Summer, criss-crossing the US.  Along with putting a lot of smiles on peoples' faces and proving that rock is indeed alive and well, we're also gonna help out one of the most worthy causes on the planet: the fight against drug abuse in our society.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>No Convention will donate 30% of our profits from this campaign, and the tour it will fund, to the Foundation For A Drug Free World (<a href=""http://www.drugfreeworld.org)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.drugfreeworld.org)</a>.  The Foundation is a nonprofit public benefit corporation that empowers youth and adults with factual information about drugs so they can make informed decisions and live drug-free.  Additionally, their Truth About Drugs campaign consists of activities that anyone can join which popularize drug-free living. These activities are simple, effective and can involve people of all ages.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We will literally take all of our proceeds from the campaign and the tour (the total amount we raise and make from playing shows, merchandise sales, and anything else), subtract our campaign and tour expenses, take 30% of that number, and give it to The Foundation.  AAAAAND . . . we'll have a bunch of swag and info on their programs to pass out both at shows and while we're on the road between venues!</span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We'll be visiting approximately 25 cities over a 33 day period, playing venues of varying sizes, and spreading the word about our band and our pledge to help the Foundation For A Drug Free World wherever we go!</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Making The Tour &amp; What You Get For Helping</h3> <p>We need to raise $40,000 to break even on expenses.  Here's some of the stuff we'll be getting with all that crazy dough:</p>

<div>Every member of No Convention has dedicated themselves to the success of this band, the revitalization of rock 'n roll, and the cause of helping as many people as we can with our music.  We're taking the opportunity to bring our nasty little rock album on the road while helping those in need re-gain life with the money we raise for the Foundation For A Drug Free World.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>To put this in to perspective, there are an estimated <b>208 million</b> people consuming illegal drugs internationally.  Obviously, this is not a small problem, and that number doesn't even begin to touch the people illicitly using and abusing prescription medications.  If we can help even one person go the other way, or dig themselves out of the hole they've gotten themselves into with drugs, our efforts would be more than justified.  And we can easily touch hundreds, if not thousands and beyond, if we get the buzz for this tour and the Foundation For A Drug Free World happening fast and big!!!<span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>Contributing to a cause like The Foundation in and of itself is awesome and a huge help, even on an individual basis.  What's really great about this campaign and about your donating to The Foundation via this campaign, is that you'll be helping to build something that will take the word on the streets, grass roots style, and get masses of people behind the campaign across the country.  Instead of helping one person, or even 10 people, we're gonna make it so that your contribution helps hundreds, and maybe even thousands or millions!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Again, we completely believe in this cause and we're all totally on-board!  Who wants to help?</span></div>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As awesome as tours are (and they REALLY are!), they are also not necessarily the glamour job that a lot of people think of.  We're gonna be spending the majority of our time in cramped quarters driving across country.  That's 7 guys driving, sleeping, eating, hanging out, in a crowded space for the majority of a 33 day tour.  Not undoable, but a bit daunting to say the least.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There's also the challenge of raising these funds, as we do need the entirety of our goal to make this work.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Aside from that, we're looking forward to our first cross-country tour and we're excited for the benefits it'll have both for our band and the many that we're gonna help through our donation to the Foundation For A Drug Free World! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>How can we be so confident?  Aside from our working out our budget to a tee and being fully dedicated to the tour and The Foundation, we've got some marketing tricks up our sleeve to get this campaign funded.  This includes creating partnerships with companies to sponsor our band (see Perks) as well as cross-promote the campaign, putting together a HUGE hash tag campaign to get tons of visibility on social media, getting in touch with local governments and police teams to help promote and set up events geared toward reaching the masses, and being super resourceful with our ""road conditions"" to make them totally workable.</p>

composer with huge passion for music creation. I started composing when I was
only 9 years old. Even though I'm young I have been in successful projects in
a role of a composer.<div>
</div>
<p>Nowadays I study in a Sibelius High-School in Helsinki, partly
as a pianist and a composer and I often work with other musicians to bring live
to my compositions. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>When composing, I want to create music apart from the
mainstream. As myself I think that music is a ""language of feelings""
which everyone can understand. Music has endless opportunities, never there will
be a day when there's no difference between songs. There are always going to be
something unique, fresh and new.""</p>

kinds of game developers, especially for indie developers. <b>Royalty-free music</b>
is one of the greatest music markets in the world, as example the trailer music
markets.<div>
</div>
<p>Royalty-free soundtrack sales are little bit smaller, but slightly
developing area, because there is a great demand for music among the indie
developers. Its lot easier and profitable to just buy royalty free songs
without hiring an actual composer with high cost. If you analyze as example
game projects here in Indiegogo you can easily notice how much money hiring a
composer can really cost. </p>
<p>So basically <b>anyone who buyes this album can freely use the music and publish their game including the soundtrack without royalties of anykind.</b><br/></p>

<b><i>Elias Luukkanen:</i></b><br/>
</div>
""Well, there two different reasons why this is 20% from the main budget.
First of all, I work alone, but I’m also studying and working along the
composing. It is really stressful to only just study along the job. Not recommended
to anyone. <br/>
<br/>
But also high-quality composing equipment can be expensive. Do you
have any idea how much it can be? Expenses can easily rise up to 5000$, because
composing programs (DAW), and Virtual Instruments (VST) are really expensive. In other words, with your help, we're able to create unique. 20 % from the 3500$ could really help me to keep up the composing.<br/>
<br/>
So if this project succeeds I strongly believe I'm going to use this section of
budget to buying more equipment. But the point the least that I can do is to try to cover the previous
costs.<div>

<h4><br/></h4>
<h3>First the Risks, then the Challenges:</h3>
<p>As in every project, there are risks and challenges. It would
be lying to say that there's no risk at all. Of course the worst scenario you
could imagine is that seas could dry, an atomic bomb could explode or the worst
- Indiegogo would have a bankrupt. Only after then the future of this project
would be unsure because of these circumstances. </p>
<p>But in truth I'm putting all my effort for this project. It
will be finished properly in time because there is only few songs still to be
composed. In other words, album is almost completed. </p>
<p>The main challenge is to get prizes of the album done in time,
+ all other extra song rewards.</p>
<p>Shipping of physical perks is new to me, but I working on it. But the finishing of the album will not be an
overwhelming challenge.<br/></p>
<p>After all, challenges are
made to make life interesting.</p>

""There are many tales to be told, but even more sounds to
be heard.""




Almost everyone must have once played or heard about typical
fantasy/adventure games where protagonist has to slay a dragon, an evil god or
something that ilk. 
When these first typical RPG games were published they were
great success. Never the less, soon after many other developers started to
follow their example and create similar game. Since then the Role-Playing Games
genre was born. 
Tales of Sound and Music is following the same example of the
first RPG games, but not as a game. It's a vast music album project created by Elias Luukkanen.

ContentsThis is a high-quality royalty-free music pack which has over
15 different songs and themes played with orchestral instruments. But that is
not the end of it, there are over 4-6 different versions/variations from each
song played with different instruments which makes them as a separate unique
songs. By that all combined there are over 45 songs in this album, which is
quite a lot!                                   






Creator of the Project





Elias is young Finnish self-taught composer with
great ambition to make composing as his full time job. Even though of his age
he has already participated in many kind of projects as a composer. 
                                                            Check out his website: 

 www.eluukkanen.com
Elias has created the music, but Roxana Hasanat has made the beautiful cover art for this album. Visit her website to see her wonderful art and games!
http://thelegendofauferre.com/






             Let the composer tell about himself









""My name is Elias Luukkanen. I'm 18-years old Finnish
composer with huge passion for music creation. I started composing when I was
only 9 years old. Even though I'm young I have been in successful projects in
a role of a composer.

Nowadays I study in a Sibelius High-School in Helsinki, partly
as a pianist and a composer and I often work with other musicians to bring live
to my compositions. 

When composing, I want to create music apart from the
mainstream. As myself I think that music is a ""language of feelings""
which everyone can understand. Music has endless opportunities, never there will
be a day when there's no difference between songs. There are always going to be
something unique, fresh and new.""













Information about the album



The plan is to sell this royalty-free album widely to all
kinds of game developers, especially for indie developers. Royalty-free music
is one of the greatest music markets in the world, as example the trailer music
markets.

Royalty-free soundtrack sales are little bit smaller, but slightly
developing area, because there is a great demand for music among the indie
developers. Its lot easier and profitable to just buy royalty free songs
without hiring an actual composer with high cost. If you analyze as example
game projects here in Indiegogo you can easily notice how much money hiring a
composer can really cost. 
So basically anyone who buyes this album can freely use the music and publish their game including the soundtrack without royalties of anykind.






Why this project is in Indiegogo?


Briefly explained











There are 3 main reasons...


Reason 1 (25% from the budget)



Marketing


If we want to have people’s attention for this album, there must be enough money for it. Marketing is not free from expenses and definitely
not cheap. There are dozens of ways to market this product widely as example
many various sites where we can sell this music album. 


Also the creating of our own website where this product will be sold is one of
the top priorities. At the moment the website has already been developed.  
Please, take a look. 


www.eluukkanen.com





Reason 2 (20%)



Future Development












Elias Luukkanen:

""Well, there two different reasons why this is 20% from the main budget.
First of all, I work alone, but I’m also studying and working along the
composing. It is really stressful to only just study along the job. Not recommended
to anyone. 

But also high-quality composing equipment can be expensive. Do you
have any idea how much it can be? Expenses can easily rise up to 5000$, because
composing programs (DAW), and Virtual Instruments (VST) are really expensive. In other words, with your help, we're able to create unique. 20 % from the 3500$ could really help me to keep up the composing.

So if this project succeeds I strongly believe I'm going to use this section of
budget to buying more equipment. But the point the least that I can do is to try to cover the previous
costs.







Reason 3








Your Influence to this Project (20%) 













It would be fantastic to have real people to give their inspiration and
influence to this very project. I have worked with different people in projects
connected in music, and the most valuable thing in it is the collaboration
itself. It has taught me many useful skills, gave me new thoughts and more
experience. 





Three ways to support this project:







1. Your feedback counts


By commenting your thoughts, criticism or supportive message on the comment section, you help me to improve as a composer. In many cases the feedback more valuable than money.








2. Share on Social Media


If you're interested about this project, share it on social media. 
By spreading the word, you ensure the project's success! Your
support matters.

3. Contribute and Earn one of the perks!!!

characters roles; some of them are quite reasonable.

2. 
Your name will be put to albums cover, in every
ToSaM album whether it is digital or physical!!!








First the Risks, then the Challenges:
As in every project, there are risks and challenges. It would
be lying to say that there's no risk at all. Of course the worst scenario you
could imagine is that seas could dry, an atomic bomb could explode or the worst
- Indiegogo would have a bankrupt. Only after then the future of this project
would be unsure because of these circumstances. 
But in truth I'm putting all my effort for this project. It
will be finished properly in time because there is only few songs still to be
composed. In other words, album is almost completed. 
The main challenge is to get prizes of the album done in time,
+ all other extra song rewards.
Shipping of physical perks is new to me, but I working on it. But the finishing of the album will not be an
overwhelming challenge.
After all, challenges are
made to make life interesting.

  Wow, you really did read the whole campaign information! Thank you very much!

Community is everything, and every little bit helps!</p>

<h3>Some backstory:</h3>
<p>After a looooooong hiatus from my singer/songwriter career (during which I recorded 3 albums and toured throughout the Northeast and across the U.S.) I wrote a new collection of songs. </p>
<p>These songs come from growing up and growing older. They come from listening to others and examining myself. They come from loss, grief, joy, love. They come from a deep appreciation of the folk, Americana, country, and singer-songwriter artists who have buoyed my spirit throughout my life.</p>
<p>This collection of songs started with a question:</p>
<p>""If you were the woman that you wanted to be...,"" how would you spend your life?</p>
<p>It's related to the question Mary Oliver poses in her poem, A Summer Day: ""Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life.""</p>
<p>This album is my answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So what does it take to make a record? </h3>
<p>Whereas years ago making a record was a magical effort behind secret doors -- nearly impenetrable to independent artists like me, and completely closed off to you -- times have changed. YOU AND I ARE THE RECORD LABEL. </p>
<p>With studio, tracking, musicians, mixing, mastering, and manufacturing, the cost of recording a single song is about $3267. Of course, there's also promotion. </p>
<p>I began pre-production in May 2019, with producer Shane Alexander at Buddhaland Studios in Thousand Oaks, CA. The main tracking and mixing will be done in August by Brian Yaskulka (Lisa Loeb, The Rescues) at his Secret World Studios in the historic Sound City complex in Van Nuys, CA. Denny Weston, Jr. (KT Tunstall, Santana) will play drums. Darby Orr (Naked to the World, Gary Myrick) will play bass. Carl Byron (CALICO the band, Young Dubliners) will play organ/keys.</p>

Influences of traditional – ethnic elements like the use of sitar and oud are very frequent and relegate to a variety of other musical styles.

The mixture of the high qualities of all the above genres, as seen by the Manhattan Project band, gives birth to the pragmatic approach to our music : the tendency to experiment with no limits and judge the result regardless of music theories or “mistakes” of rules that might characterize the individual elements.                The band’s line-up is consisted of George Constantine Kratsas ( EMG artist) on guitars, Leonidas Diamadopoulos on keyboards, Antonis Karpanos on the bass, Nikitas Mandolas on the drums and Tasos Seremetis on the oud.                Currently, Manhattan Project is on the verge of releasing their debut full-length album, expected in mid-October 2016. An indiegogo campaign was just launched, aiming at the economic support by MP’s fans for the album’s expenses: funding the artwork commission, the production of the album’s physical copies, the upcoming promo-clip.                Manhattan Project’s aim is to do a lot of live performances in Greece as well as abroad, and co-operate with a reliable record company.Discography & clips :July 2015:             Promo-clip of the self-titled song “The Manhattan Project”,                                 taken from the band’s upcoming full-length album.                                 Youtube link :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0wqXLuBgrgJanuary 2015:     Promo-clip of the song “The God Complex”, taken from the band’s                                upcoming full-length album.                                Youtube link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Pow6QY3LIMarch 2014:      Release of “Abducted Cosmos”, George Constantine Kratsas’                               personal album,composed by George and performed by                               Manhattan Project.Bandcamp link:                                                                                                                               https://georgeconstantinekratsas.bandcamp.com/releasesOctober 2013:   Promo-clip of the song “Samsara”, performed in-studio by                               Manhattan Project. Youtube link:                               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWGfB0yct04July 2013:           Release of “Into the Abyss of Time”, Leonidas Diamandopoulos’                               personal albumDistinctions, Awards and Sponsorships :2016:                     Official EMG Artist – George Constantine Kratsas                                Engl Amps Sponsorship – George Constantine Kratsas                                Two Notes Audio Engineering Sponsorship – George Constantine Kratsa2014:                     Best Keyboardist of the Lives Award, prize : 1000euro Yamaha keyboard –                                           Leonidas Diamandopoulos                                Participation in Schoolwave Festival – Manhattan Project2012:                     Volos Elite Guitar competition – 1st prize – George Constantine Kratsas",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p>I'm Katrice Cornett and I am the founder of Refreshing Cafe a platform for Independent Gospel, Christian &amp; Inspirational Artists.  In 2012, my son Jermaine Jones also known as ""The Gentle Giant"" was sent home from American Idol Season 11 with the whole world watching him be degrated and made to look like a criminal on national TV.  This series of events sent our world into a tailspin. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534465110/qkxlqzq1dtkbu80xorf1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At the time I was trying to get my newly founded performing arts center off the ground and recover from such a devastating blow to my son's music career.  I felt the need to develop something to fight back.  So we birthed Refreshing Cafe, a place where artists can come and network, build their fan base, be appreciated, earn money and get a real understanding of who they are in the industry, at the same time, perfect their artistry without judgement.   We provide them with guidance, artist development tips, marketing materials, and foundational knowledge of how to establish themselves as a business. </p>
<p>Refreshing Cafe has completed its sixth season this July 2018.  This CD compilation project is the next level of Refreshing Cafe.  This is an opportunity offered to the artists who choose to become a part of our community.  Many of the independent artists who grace our platform come with original material.  Their creativity is appreciated by our audiences and we encourage them to use our platform as a place to introduce their music to the world.  However, being able to produce, record and distribute their original compositions for some of them seems impossible to achieve because of the lack of knowledge on how to do it, but mostly because of the financial commitment it takes to produce a quality project that will be recognized and competitive in the industry.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534470097/pgnaz5wp5meqjo9qmjqq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will allow Refreshing Cafe to achieve our dream of being able to give our artists the opportunity to produce, record and distrbute their own compositions.  Each artist will not only be apart of this project but they will receive a professionally recorded single that will introduce them to the industry which can take their music careers to the next level.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our campaign goal is $10,000.  This funding will allow us to pay for recording studio sessions, musicians, background singers, graphic designers for cd artwork and marketing promotions, advertising, cd replication, marketing campaigns, a cd release concert which will require building rental, sound, lighting and stage crews, distribution campaign, music and promotional videos, photo shoot and t-shirts, hats and marketing paraphernalia.</p>
<p><i><u><strong>We are excited to offer the following perks:</strong></u></i></p>
<ul>
<li>One (1) Digital Download of Single of your choice</li>
<li>One Autographed photo &amp; Digital Single Download</li>
<li>Invite to Pre-Launch Listening Party &amp; Autographed Photo </li>
<li>Refreshing Cafe T-shirt &amp; One(1) Digital Download of CD</li>
<li>VIP Seating at the Release Party, CD &amp; Your Name will be listed on the CD credits as a sponsor</li>
<li>Private Concert for top 25 sponsors, Professional Photo taken w/Artists, Autographed CD &amp; Your Name will be listed on the CD credits as a sponsor</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The opportunities for indie artists have never been greater.  There are so many options to choose, methods to follow and results to achieve.  With supporters such as yourself it allows the artist to become totally creative with their projects.  It also helps make the industry more diversified.  Without the controlling demands of a record label, it allows the indie artist the opportunity to share their uniqueness.  </p>
<p>One of the greatest challenges of being an indie artist is funding and getting exposure, most of the time.  We have access to a worldwide audience but marketing and campaigning can become costly when trying to promote a new project.  That's where you come in.  Crowdfunding platforms such as this one help us to be able to compete with the record labels who have the funding.  </p>
<p>Your support through this platform will allow us to produce a music video which is one of the major ways to distribute music through platforms such as Youtube, Vimeo and others.  Some of the other marketing and advertising forums such as radio, and social media ads are other ways your support will help us to promote this project to make it a huge success.  </p>
<p>In short, with your generous support it will minimize the risks and challenges of this project tremendously.  You will be instrumental in being a vital part of the debut launch of five of the artists who are participating in this compilation project.  </p>
<p>I have been an indie artist for over 20 years and I would not have lasted this long without the support of my fans and people like you who believe in supporting the creatives community.  I thank you and I appreciate you.  I have overcome many hurdles and kept going in the face of many closed doors.  Many times I wanted to quit, but just in the knick of time someone would come along and let me know how my music kept them going, or I would receive a donation from someone who was blessed by my music.  These are the times that make it all worth it.  </p>

<p>Refreshing Cafe has given me the chance to help other indie artists who may be feeling that same way.  They may be on the vurge of giving up, but we can help them understand that the struggle is well worth it when one person is uplifted by their music.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>I do understand that every one may not be able to give a monetary donation to this project.  If this is you, you can help by spreading the word.  I encourage you to use the Indiegogo share tools to share our campaign with your friends and family.  We will also need volunteers to help with the CD Release Concert which will be in June 2019.  If you are interested in volunteering these are the areas that are available:</p>

What's so special about this project?

Let me be straight, and say that pretty much everything I do artistically is influenced by my Catholic faith. (Augustine is my confirmation name.) That being said, the word catholic is defined as universal. 
By honestly looking at the challenges faced when trying to reconcile my spirituality while living in the real world, I hope this album profoundly affects everyone who listens to it in some small way: lyrically, musically, or spiritually.


How do the contributions help?
As can always (sometimes annoyingly) be expected of myself, every note and word is carefully chosen. To paraphrase what someone once said about my music, ""a new layer of onion is peeled off in each listening."" Instrumentation and production are of the utmost importance to accurately paint my story.



This particular fundraising effort is first and foremost to pay the superstar producer, Marc Lacuesta. He has a roster of Nashville successes, and I am especially excited for his vocal production talents. He and I went to Berklee together and can't wait to be working with each other again. If we raise enough, we'll also be able to use it to pay for:

The other musicians playing on the project, who have put in so much time already to make these songs come alive.
Marketing! It doesn't happen on its own...


What are the perks?
All people who contribute $25 or more will get the dual, digital album of Convert Augustine and Consummate Augustine. Of course, the physical albums are an option, as well.

My favorite perk is a choose-your-own adventure video series about the songs in the Augustine series. I'll personally hold your hand and bring you as deep as you dare into your choice of musical composition, lyrics, and/or the philosophies of each song.

There are some other fun things you can get, like:

A singing telegram.
A full song I write just for you.
A personalized tour of New Orleans.
Bound scores of the albums to follow along at home.
Time in the studio with us.
A really big thank you and executive credit on the album.

<div>
<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Is TheOverflow legal?</h1>
<div>Of course! Launching TheOverflow required many complex legal approvals which have by God’s grace all happened. Through an agreement with our distributor, we ensure all Artists are paid based on their “share of listens” on the service <br/>
</div>
<div>
<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;"">How much will it cost?</h1>
You can access The Overflow service for $4.99 a month, after a FREE 7 day trial without adding a credit card. There are no commitments, and you can cancel at any time.

By adding your credit card, you can extend your trial for FREE for up to 21 days.That's a total of 28 days FREE. <br/>
</div>
<div>
<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Why is TheOverflow Not Free?</h1>We get this question a lot surprisingly.<br/><br/>The Christian music we know and love takes money to create, record and distribute. It's a very expensive process, and as people who benefit from it, we all have a responsibility to compensate the artists, musicians and labels that produced the music. <br/><br/>TheOverflow is a paid subscription service, and we payout a large portion of our revenue to the rights holders - labels and artists. By using theOverflow, you help support and grow the christian artists and its community - so thank you in advance!<br/>

<h1>How does The Overflow get its music catalog?</h1>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">We work with labels, distributors and aggregators around the world to legally license their music and make it available on The Overflow.

If you are an independent artist who wants to submit to TheOverflow - please use either TuneCore or CDBaby, and make sure you select 7Digital as one of your digital stores. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;"">What makes TheOverflow different from the iTunes or other download stores?</h1>Well, for starters, they’re not designed for Christian &amp; Gospel music fans! Secondly, download stores are just that – for downloads. They’re intended for one-off album purchases. With TheOverflow, you get unlimited Christian and Gospel music for $4.99/month – less than two lattes from your favorite barista, and about the cost of six albums a year from a download store. The cool thing about TheOverflow is you can still save songs, albums or playlists for offline listening. So, you can stream it, or save it. Either one. All for $4.99/month. ﻿<br/>
</div>
<div>
<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;"">What does the name “TheOverflow” mean?</h1>We love telling this story at TheOverflow. The story actually starts with the first formal presentation ever made, and before the company was formed back in the Spring of 2011. The title of that story was “One smooth stone felled a giant”. Why the David and Goliath analogy? Well, when you’re trying to compete with the world’s biggest company (Apple) and the world’s biggest e-commerce company (Amazon), you’d better have God on your side or you’re finished! <br/><br/>As the unnamed company was growing, it was co-founders Stephen Relph and Chris Shaban desire to find a name that Christians would understand, and the world would want to understand. While trying to find a name, we were at a complete loss. Well, one weekend Christian artist Aaron Gillespie was staying at Chris’ house, he suggested that “whatever you do, put ‘the’ in the name”. After an unsuccessful brainstorming session at a restaurant, Chris shared Aaron’s feedback with Stephen. We decided to pray and seek God’s help right then and there to find the name. Within minutes, we said, “what about TheOverflow?”. Convinced the URL would no longer be available (note: the URL you want is pretty much never available), we checked anyway, and it was available. We knew that “Overflow” is found in Psalm 23, but were woefully unaware of the full context. What blew us away was that in this Psalm David (…that shepherd boy who wielded that one stone!) is talking about how God will “…Prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.” We were frankly blown away. What an affirmation of the leading of the Holy Spirit! Within days, TheOverflow.com was purchased. <br/><br/> So… it’s our prayer and our belief, that God will use TheOverflow to help you go deeper in your faith, and impact the world for the glory of Jesus Christ. Remember, “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden” (Matthew 5:14). So… don’t hide your faith, OVERFLOW!!!<br/>

    Risks & Challenges You may not like the music...but you can at least be happy knowing you'll get to keep the music longer than the 2 minutes it takes to eat a plate of potato salad...

    Other Ways You Can Help Maybe you're not into music and don't want to donate $1 or $15 for music...You can still help by sharing the campaign on your instagram, facebook, twitter, tumbr...or whatever.

<h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
<p>I've been a musician most of my life. In 2012 I began a spiritual journey of creating instrumental music in the tuning frequency of <strong>432Hz</strong> which opens the atmosphere to spiritual encounters, healing and restoration.This resulted in a catalog of 12 albums-<strong>the 432experience collection</strong>-which can be found on my website: <a href=""https://www.tasteofmanna.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.tasteofmanna.net/</a>   </p>
<p>It's been quite a journey! It has also been two years since my last album.</p>
<p>A lot has happened and changed during that time; but, one thing has never changed: My desire to create music that captures the <i>Sound of Heaven, </i>and opens Heaven in fresh new ways.</p>
<p>Now-after a two year hiatus- a new CD, ""Gates of Ascension"" is at hand!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>And, I need your help to release it!</strong></p>
<p>This is an important project because it reveals where I am at in my journey. There's a deepening awareness of the heavenly realms of Glory that I am excited to share with you.</p>
<p>It's important for another reason, too. While my creative heart and process has not changed, the <u><i><strong>platform</strong></i></u> has! All the other albums are in digital format only. With the release of ""Gates of Ascension"" I am moving from ""digital only"" to included physical product.</p>
<p>My wife, Donna, and I have had many people asking for physical CD's. We also know there are many venues we want to reach that require physical product.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>It's time to expand!</strong></u></p>
<p>I believe ""Gates of Ascension"" is the right project at the right time for such a move. You, as a contributor, have a very important role to play in making this happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Makes this CD Important</h3>
<p>There were two personal experiences that has a powerful impact on me leading to the creation of ""Gates of Ascension.""</p>
<p>The first was a time of deep meditation on the experience the Apostle John had while exiled to Patmos. In a vision, he was shown a door standing open in Heaven and was called to come up. He was immediately caught up in the Spirit and taken through the door. I was made aware of how powerful and personal the connection is between Heaven and earth in radical new ways.</p>
<p>The second experience was a vision I had in which the Spirit of God took me to the beginning of a mountain trail, and He showed me a  gate set in place that opened to an ascending path leading to what He called the ""Mountains of Worship.""</p>
<p>These experiences ignited the creative fire for this new CD. <u><strong>Each track is a Gate of Ascension</strong></u>. The invitation is to step through these ""Gates"" into the atmosphere of Heaven and be taken to the Mountains of Worship.</p>
<h3>The Songs</h3>
<p><strong>1. <u>""Gates of Ascension""</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""I am the gate; whoever enters through Me will be saved. They will come in and out, and find pasture."" (Jesus)</i></p>
<p><strong>2. <u>""By a Hidden Path, I Come""</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""One dark night, fired with Love's urgent longings, ah, the sheer grace, in the darkness I went out unseen, my house being all now still"" (John Michael Talbot)</i></p>
<p><strong>3.<u> ""Distant Lands""</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, whose heart is set on pilgrimage. As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a spring; the rain also covers it with pools. They go from strength to strength; each one appears before God in Zion."" (King David)</i></p>
<p><strong>4. <u>""Captivated by Beauty, Raptured in Love""</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""For you reach into my heart. With one flash of your eyes I am breathless-I am overcome by merely a glance from your worshipping eyes, for you have stolen my heart. I am held hostage by your love..: (King Solomon)</i></p>
<p><strong>5.<u> ""Heaven's Shores""</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Prophet of God, in quest of the uttermost, long have you searched the distances for your ship. And now your ship has come, and you must needs go. Deep is your longing for the land of your memories and the dwelling place of your greater desires; and our love would not bind you or our needs hold you."" (Gibran)</i></p>
<p><strong>6. <u>""Chambers of Ecstasy""</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""O lamps of fire, in the splendor of which the deep caverns of sense, dim and dark, with unwonted brightness give light and warmth together to their beloved."" (St. John of the Cross)</i></p>
