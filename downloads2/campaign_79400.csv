</h3>
<p>Firstly we just want to thank you so much for taking time to view our Indiegogo campaign - you ROCKSTARS! Before we explain our campaign to you, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. </p>
<p><i><a href=""http://www.danzemacabre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Danze Macabre</a> is a female fronted classic/melodic rock band hailing from the New Forest, England, UK. Song writing twins Mark (guitar) &amp; Steve (bass) Owers (formally of '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779z6xVqwnA"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779z6xVqwnA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lionsheart' </a>&amp; '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HdyYC_-woU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Psychics'</a>) teamed up with classically trained vocalist Nell Montague-Rendall whilst working on a different project in 2014. Upon listening to a playback of some recordings, it became clear to the twins that this was the voice they had been looking for. The voice to help deliver their unique brand of powerful yet melodic rock in the right way - the BEST way. After a short discussion with the band's now music publisher and manager, Danze Macabre was born! The band has come a long way in a very short time; working in the studio on their début album, releasing their first <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D710ut2fRWc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">music video 'Jamaica Inn'</a>, organising the singles official download release date - and now creating this very special Indiegogo campaign! Take a look at some extra special 'Making of' features under the 'Gallery' page.</i></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Are We Doing?</h3>
<p>We need your help to create our next music video for our self-titled track '<i>Danze Macabre</i>', and put the finishing touches to our début album.</p>
<p>Once again, we have teamed up with the creative crew from our first <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D710ut2fRWc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">music video 'Jamaica Inn'</a> to bring you an exciting, dark, gothic tale of a young woman who attends a glamorous masked ball where all is not quite as it seems. Think along the lines of the cult films '<i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_b-zpSnoHs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eyes Wide Shut</a></i>' and '<i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PewtQsgN5uo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rosemary's Baby</a></i>'.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

Danze Macabre is a female fronted classic/melodic rock band hailing from the New Forest, England, UK.

The band has come a long way in a very short time; working in the studio on their début album, releasing their first music video 'Jamaica Inn', organising the singles official download release date - and now creating this very special Indiegogo campaign! Take a look at some extra special 'Making of' features under the 'Gallery' page.

What Are We Doing?
We need your help to create our next music video for our self-titled track 'Danze Macabre', and put the finishing touches to our début album.
Once again, we have teamed up with the creative crew from our first music video 'Jamaica Inn' to bring you an exciting, dark, gothic tale of a young woman who attends a glamorous masked ball where all is not quite as it seems. Think along the lines of the cult films 'Eyes Wide Shut' and 'Rosemary's Baby'. 
To give you an idea of our vision, take a look at a few of our creative ideas (photo source: www.pinterest.com):

                    
   
What We Need & What You Get
 We need £20,000 of your hard earned dough to make this music video and album everything we want it to be. This will help us fund production costs for the video, which includes a fantastic location, wonderful creative team, gorgeous period costumes, hair & makeup, set design & props, and additional studio time we need to finish the album.
""Nothing in this life comes for free"" - so we have some rather exciting 'perks' in store for you all:


We have created a fabulous Danze Macabre 4 track EP exclusively for you Indiegogo-ers. Get a digital version for just £10, or a limited edition singed copy for £25.
Get a special 'Thanks' on Facebook + a download of our first single 'Jamaica Inn' for £5, or....spend a teeny bit more for a 'Postcard' with a message from the band (+ 'Jamaica Inn' download) for £7.
£25 gets you our EP download + an official Danze Macabre T-shirt.....who doesn't like a bit of good ol' band merch!!
Danze Macabre Packages (limited) - our Basic package gets you all the above PLUS a hand written lyric sheet of our track 'Danze Macabre' for £180. Our Ultimate package gets you ALL the above, PLUS a special mention on our debut album sleeve for £250.

You don't even need  to buy a perk - you can simply contribute whatever you can afford. Seriously, if you can only donate £1, that gets us that little bit closer to pursuing our dream!

<p></p>
<p>Today, many teens spend too much time on their
cell phones. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation study (2010), “<i>Kids and teens ages 8 to 18 spend
seven-and-a-half hours a day, seven days a week, engaging with media, more time
than they spend with any other activity besides sleeping</i>.” As a public
school teacher and a parent, I see this trend as a serious problem that is
negatively affecting the socio-emotional skills of our youth. This issue encouraged me to take action and and create MUFFASA. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">MUFFASAstands for </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">M</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">usic </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">U</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">nites </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">F</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">riends </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">F</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">amilies </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">nd </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">S</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">chools </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ssociation.

Campaign Name: Guitars Over Cell Phones


Description

Today, many teens spend too much time on their
cell phones. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation study (2010), “Kids and teens ages 8 to 18 spend
seven-and-a-half hours a day, seven days a week, engaging with media, more time

negatively affecting the socio-emotional skills of our youth. This issue encouraged me to take action and and create MUFFASA. MUFFASAstands for Music Unites Friends Families And Schools Association. It is a multicultural music
education and youth mentoring project created by Ulises Rodriguez Palada and a group of parents from the Chaska-Shakopee area in Minnesota, United States. The program will be funded through fundraising
activities like this, grants, and generous donations. For more information about our
program, please visit www.muffasa.org 
One of the goals
of this campaign is to provide selected kids with an opportunity to reduce their
cell phone use and instead invest that time in a more productive activity, such
as playing guitar. Research has shown
the tremendous benefits that playing a musical instrument provides. Some
benefits include the improvement of cognitive, emotional, cultural, and
academic skills. 





What are the Objectives of this Campaign?
At the end of the 2015 - 2016
academic school year, selected students for the project will be able to:
* Learn the basic skills to play guitar.
* Improve their socio-emotional
skills. 
* Increase
their engagement in school. 
*  Improve
their academic performance.
* Reduce their dependency on
electronics.


Who is Going to be Benefited from this Project?

Fifteen students grades 6 - 12
from the Chaska-Shakopee area who demonstrate outstanding ability, interest,
and discipline to play acoustic guitar. Priority will be given to underrepresented students and those kids who have a lot of musical potential, but are struggling to put their cell phones down.  


Timeline

Selected
students will receive a gently-used guitar and weekly beginning guitar lessons from Mr. Rodriguez Palada. Classes will be one hour and fifteen minutes long and will be offered at one of the schools in the
Chaska-Shakopee area. Sessions will go from October, 2015  to March,
 2016. At the end of the program,
students will plan and perform a guitar concert for their community. 


What I Need  I need to raise funds to buy gently-used guitars, rent a classroom, and cover for instruction expenses. All the money raised from the campaign will be used to cover the following:

<p>My name is Solomon Jaye and I'm a musi-holic.

<h3>What is 'Ordinary Man'?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>‘Ordinary Man’ is the culmination of my time living in New York working an AWFUL telemarketing job, falling in and out of love, and just trying to make something out of everyday existence.</p>
<p>Musically, this album is a tribute to my appreciation of 60s and 70s music (“real” music with “real” musicians and singers). Each song features all live instruments and pays homage in its own way while holding onto a contemporary sensibility. I took every ounce of me and poured it into something I can share. Raw, candid emotion. Not for fame and superstardom, but for you to listen and say “wow… I felt that.” This album is about life, love, happiness, and pain. </p>
<p>For the last 11 months, I've been working with an amazing team that believed in my work. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Grammy Award winning engineer Clark Germain, producer Jamey Tate (Al Jarreau, Mindi Abair, David Benoit, David Pack), keyboards by Jeff Babko (“Jimmy Kimmel Live,” Frank Ocean, Jason Mraz), guitars by Justin Smith (“Mad Men,” “Wicked,” “Book of Mormon,” LA Philharmonic), bass by David Hughes (David Benoit, Chaka Khan, Melissa Etheridge) and drums by Jamey Tate. Thanks to them and the mental support of my friends, family, and fans, the project is in the final stages.</span></p>

<li>After that, I'll continue working hard to mass produce this product and present it to the world!</li>

for professional management of projects I was assigned in the local
Municipality. In December 2013, the Mayor appointed me, Director, of Dom na
Mladi (House of Youth) in Stip, Macedonia.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My first responsibility was to watch over
completion of the urgent repairs required for the physical facility. I did so, using
local funds and by securing Grant funds from a Swiss agency. We completed
repairs, according to stipulations, in December 2014.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now, I am responsible to create and administer
this Crowd Funding Campaign, on Indiegogo. Our purpose is to raise funds to
purchase sound and light show equipment. With this equipment installed, DNM will
generate income and achieve sustainability. Next, with income generated from music
festivals, concerts, and gigs, DNM will expand its programing across a full
spectrum of the Arts!</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I want to thank US
Peace Corps, Macedonia for responding positively to my request for a Community
Development Volunteer to join our Staff. As you know, Peace Corps Volunteers
serve only in countries where they are invited. The three Peace Corps goals
encompass development of mutual understanding and friendship and to strengthen Staff
with specialized skills a Volunteer might bring to the work. When Community
Development Volunteer, Jim Willis, joined our Staff-Team, in January 2015, I
directed him to assist us with strategic planning and writing skills. The text
below is one example of how he supports us in our work. Thank you, Jim.</p><br/> <p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Broad
grassroots support drives this project. And, it is promoted by both local and national
government. Your donations will be deposited in a special bank account at the
national level and administered by the Director of DNM and the Mayor of Stip.
The acquisition of professional sound &amp; light show equipment is the next step
in DNM’s strategic plan. With this equipment in place, DNM immediately becomes
sustainable and self-supporting of its continued operation and future expansions
of programming. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Resurrecting DNM is truly worthy of your support.
This project will be successful and it already has traction. I count myself
grateful to be a part of this community effort. I ask you to join too.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><b>What is Dom na
Mladi?  </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dom
na Mladi (DNM) means “House of Youth” in Macedonian language. DNM is located in
Stip, Macedonia, a town of approximately fifty-five thousand residents, which
is also home to a significant, National University and Music Academy. The
town’s location----in east-central Macedonia----is approximately one hour and
fifteen minutes, by car, southeast from the capital city, Skopje. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">DNM
is a government organization operating from within the Stip Municipality. The
Municipality provides basic, operating funds (for utilities and maintenance)
and employee salaries are supported through the National Minister of Culture.
In April 2015, the national government approved funding to hire six new
employees, who bring skills necessary to realize DNM’s “Vision.” </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
building and grounds are a unique assembly of irreplaceable elements, situated
half way up Isar Hill, which is near the center of town. Atop Isar are the
ruins of an ancient fortress which amplifies the “presence” of this dramatic
scene. The DNM building contains a concert hall (200 to 300 people) with an
elevated stage, a bar, a large adjacent room for multipurpose uses, three
office spaces and three areas appropriate for classrooms and training. The
grounds consist of an outdoor amphitheater (1000 to 1200 people); an additional
out-building; two open-air bars; and performance areas terraced on two levels. An
enormous, steel-structured “Umbrella” shelters the outdoor stage from weather
and also functions to symbolize the “Spirit” of DNM. The “Umbrella,” is the
official DNM Logo. As one can see from the photographs, the “Umbrella,” also symbolizes
DNM’s current need for infrastructure improvement.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Historically, Stip----where DNM
is located---- has always been known as a town hungry for music and the Arts.
Approximately eight years ago, the national government designated Stip to be the
home to a new, national university. This university in Stip became significant
in a very short time. It now enrolls nearly fifteen thousand domestic and international
students. DNM will become an integral part of the ""town/gown""
relationships here as this community, at-large, continues to blossom. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">New highway construction----to be
completed next year----will put Stip just 45 minutes from the National Airport
located in the capital city, Skopje. Because of its location, Stip is already
the eastern transportation hub. One of five high schools in Stip is dedicated solely
to music. Local professors and working artists are abundant here; they will
propel high-quality ""after school"" mentoring across a spectrum of the
Arts.</p><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436787595/vwu3l00uf4pwvbc7d7lv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><b>Brief History</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When Macedonia was a part of Yugoslavia, this facility provided
dining, housing, sports, and entertainment for military officers. The public
gathered here too. Throughout the community, DNM was known as “the place” to go
in the evening to relax, enjoy a drink, listen to live music, and dance. When
Macedonia became independent, the national government remodeled DNM and used
this facility as a music-center for youth in the region. The music center flourished.
For several decades, DNM enjoyed its reputation for being the “happening place”
for Rock, Blues, Jazz and Underground music across the Balkans. Many artists
wanted to perform at DNM because they knew the people of Stip were a special
audience that genuinely understood and appreciated high-quality music of all
kinds. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The best bands played here; as did many European and International
Artists. When spoken, the words “Dom na Mladi” still engender pride across
generations, who remember, fondly, their experiences during its “heyday.” The
phrase “I will meet you at the Umbrella,” continues to evoke elation and wonder
about the not too distant past, when so many creative accomplishments were
happening here. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When Macedonia made the wise decision to create a center for
youth, in Stip, their decision rippled across the Balkans. People began to
notice; large crowds of young people attended performances here. By
demonstrating the power of music to engage youth around high values and common
purposes (when they have a special place) DNM put Stip on the map! </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As you know, Macedonia became an independent Democratic Republic
in 1991. Start-up is never easy. Because unemployment is high, many youth need
to leave Macedonia to earn a living in other countries. Strategically, this
trend must be reversed. It is true for all peoples that the future of one's
country rests in the hands, hearts, and minds of its young. The youth of
Macedonia know the future of their Republic rests in their hands. They know
they need to “lift their country up by its own bootstraps.” Spirit, hope,
passion and perseverance are four key energies that drive accomplishment of a
challenge----this large!  So, this
project to revitalize DNM goes straight to the heart of the matter.</p><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436787683/rnndqt3emukxzoqwsjmm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Rationale for the Project</b><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We all know that shared-music and the Arts have the power to

<p>Misa E’ Gallo
nace del Hip-Hop pero se expande por todo un conglomerado de géneros musicales
tomando prestado la energía del Funk, la actitud del Rock, la elegancia e
improvisaciones del Jazz, el sazón de la Música Latina entre otros. Estos
ingredientes crean una fusión única que apela a los sentidos y a la
cotidianidad reconociendo ritmos y melodías pero que obliga a retorcer el
cuerpo con dicha innovación. </p>
<p><b>Historia: </b></p>
<p>Misa E’ Gallo Comenzó su
primera gira programada en Febrero 2015 “Guerrilla Tour” en el que se
incluyeron visitas a Orlando, Miami y Fort Lauderdale , Florida y todo Puerto
Rico. Como un esfuerzo continuo se propone mantener el tour hasta finales de
Mayo 2015. Para en ese entonces darle paso  a los nuevos esfuerzos; disco,
videos musicales, campañas publicitarias y gira de espectáculos. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1355618/files/20150404163431-CoverPictureMisaEGalloAbril2015.png?1428190471"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>El Proyecto: </b></p>
<p>Hemos
trabajado muy fuerte y poco a poco hemos logrado cumplir nuestras metas; como
haber lanzado  nuestro primer EP y comenzar a grabar nuestro primer disco
y con este proceso es que se pone la cosa buena. En nuestros planes de
llevarles nuestra música y su mensaje de la manera que ustedes merecen con la
mayor claridad y calidad posible hemos decidido hacer un video musical de una
de las canciones que saldrá en el disco, “El loco”, una de nuestras favoritas.
Un vídeo que plasmará la esencia de la canción y de lo que es Misa E' Gallo
llevándote en un mundo visual y haciéndote parte de este movimiento. Como
ustedes ya saben una producción de excelencia y profesional conlleva un serie
de gastos que se nos ha hecho muy cuesta arriba conseguir. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Trama del Video</b>:</p>
<p>La historia del
vídeo toma lugar en algún casco urbano puertorriqueño. En la historia podemos
observar como la ambición de exceso de dinero y poder lleva a líderes del país
a la deshonra, manipulación y como resultado la sociedad, en especial la clase
trabajadora, llega a un nivel absurdo de estanque, abacoro y dificultad
económica y social. En respuesta a esto Gerry y Victor, cantante y bajista de
Misa E’ Gallo, deciden reunir a la banda y todos los artistas de Puerto Rico
desde pintores, fotógrafos, bailarines, artistas plásticos, deportistas,

Este video es bien importante para nosotros ya que no solamente es el primer sencillo, de nuestro primer disco. Si no que representa nuestra lucha diaria como artistas sobreviviendo en el sistema.  Misa: 
Misa E’ Gallo
nace del Hip-Hop pero se expande por todo un conglomerado de géneros musicales
tomando prestado la energía del Funk, la actitud del Rock, la elegancia e
improvisaciones del Jazz, el sazón de la Música Latina entre otros. Estos
ingredientes crean una fusión única que apela a los sentidos y a la
cotidianidad reconociendo ritmos y melodías pero que obliga a retorcer el
cuerpo con dicha innovación. 
Historia: 
Misa E’ Gallo Comenzó su
primera gira programada en Febrero 2015 “Guerrilla Tour” en el que se
incluyeron visitas a Orlando, Miami y Fort Lauderdale , Florida y todo Puerto
Rico. Como un esfuerzo continuo se propone mantener el tour hasta finales de
Mayo 2015. Para en ese entonces darle paso  a los nuevos esfuerzos; disco,
videos musicales, campañas publicitarias y gira de espectáculos. El Proyecto: 
Hemos
trabajado muy fuerte y poco a poco hemos logrado cumplir nuestras metas; como
haber lanzado  nuestro primer EP y comenzar a grabar nuestro primer disco
y con este proceso es que se pone la cosa buena. En nuestros planes de
llevarles nuestra música y su mensaje de la manera que ustedes merecen con la
mayor claridad y calidad posible hemos decidido hacer un video musical de una
de las canciones que saldrá en el disco, “El loco”, una de nuestras favoritas.
Un vídeo que plasmará la esencia de la canción y de lo que es Misa E' Gallo
llevándote en un mundo visual y haciéndote parte de este movimiento. Como
ustedes ya saben una producción de excelencia y profesional conlleva un serie
de gastos que se nos ha hecho muy cuesta arriba conseguir. 

Trama del Video:
La historia del
vídeo toma lugar en algún casco urbano puertorriqueño. En la historia podemos
observar como la ambición de exceso de dinero y poder lleva a líderes del país
a la deshonra, manipulación y como resultado la sociedad, en especial la clase
trabajadora, llega a un nivel absurdo de estanque, abacoro y dificultad
económica y social. En respuesta a esto Gerry y Victor, cantante y bajista de
Misa E’ Gallo, deciden reunir a la banda y todos los artistas de Puerto Rico
desde pintores, fotógrafos, bailarines, artistas plásticos, deportistas,
malabaristas, músicos, actores etc. Para organizar un contraataque artístico
representando a la clase trabajadora puertorriqueña.
Esto desemboca en una “guerra” (literal) artísticas donde las pistolas
son guitarras y bajos, los francotiradores son fotógrafos urbanos, las cuchillas
son pinceles y las granadas bombas de colores etc. Y se enfrentan a un grupo de
funcionarios que  lucharán hasta el fin por mantener su poder económico,
sus trucos y corrupción. La función es volver a demostrar lo que se nos ha
demostrado la historia tantas y tantas veces; que el cambio comienza por la
expresión y la mejor manera de expresarnos es a través del arte. Se desarrolla
una batalla intensa en donde solo saldrá un ganador… ¿Quién Será?
Presupuesto
aproximado: 
El video esta cotizado para el mínimo de necesidades, mas un 10% de
contingencia para un total de 6,370.00 como producción ideal. Pero sabemos que
la realidad es otra, por lo que solicitamos a través de esta campaña 3,500.00
en ayudas, mientras, nosotros seguiremos trabajando duro para cubrir el resto
de necesidad.

Some of you may know me as the lead singer and front man of the band Souls Harbor. I’m starting a new venture with Sonny Bond, Davey Masteller and Doug McCarthy. It will be an alternative rock project that embraces energy, well written songs, great musicianship and compassion. 
Hailing from the Low-Country of South Carolina in the town Hilton Head, Akilavue is comprised of a group of musicians that found a common thread amidst their very different experiences and backgrounds. With a raw, in-your-face rock sound, that displays an energy and drive that can only come from the melding of the unique backgrounds of it’s individual members. From the Southern-styled rock background of the guitarist Sonny Bond, to the seasoned jazz experience of Davey Masteller, the thundering metal/punk influence of drummer Doug McCarthy and the raw and powerful vocals of Doug Marshall, Akilavue is sure to strike a chord with music lovers of all varieties.



Our campaign is to raise much needed money to continue this project that we have been working on for the past 9 months. We have, as a band, have came to the realization that we need the help of our music community which includes, our personal fans of us, friends and family as well as new fans, to chip in to help us get this project completed. It is important to us, to keep music in our lives and to continue to create music for our fans.



There is no doubt, that with your donations that our passion of making an album that will include a digital download version, a compact disc version and a vinyl version of this full length, along with a music video to coincide with the release, even closer within our grasp. 


Majority of the money collected will go towards producing, engineering, mixing and mastering of the album. The remaining money will go towards artwork, packaging, merchandise etc..to ensure our fans a high quality product. If we do well and have enough leftover, on Indiegogo,we would like to use the rest of the money towards a legit music video.


We have collectively discussed the perks and we feel we have came up with some really solid packages to make our fans feel they are getting their money’s worth. We want our music in your hands, we want you to crank it loud in your car and in your headphones. We want you to sing our songs when we play them in front of you and for you the fan, to feel what we felt when we were writing them!!! 

If for some reason we do not meet our goal, whatever money’s collected will go toward the most important thing, THE MUSIC! 

Whether it has been because of a work schedules, to playing gigs to make ends meet as well as finances, that has held up the process of finishing this album in a timely manner, we feel your donations will eliminate these obstacles. If you are in a position where you cannot donate, spreading the word to your friends and family is just as important.

<p></p>
<p>'Duo Diez' is an innovative and eclectic musical collaboration between guitarist Dimitris Dekavallas and violinist Violeta Barrena. Since meeting at the Royal Academy of Music as students back in 2005, we discovered a shared interest in playing and promoting Spanish, Ladino and Latin American classical music. We decided to work together in 2012, and this signalled the beginning of Duo Diez.</p>
<div>
<p>Since then, we've been performing and touring all over the world and have loved every minute of it. However somehow in the whole three years we've been playing together, we never actually released an album... until now.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>'From Granada to Buenos Aires'</b></h2>
<p>Our debut album '<b>From Granada to Buenos Aires</b>' was recorded with Grammy Award-winning producer <b>James MacMillan</b> in his home studio in Hastings, and features 18 varied and exciting tracks. These are drawn from our musical roots in Latin-American and Spanish and Ladino folk music and also feature some of our own compositions and arrangements as well.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Even more excitingly, we've booked the major London Venue of <b>Conway Hall</b> to launch our album with a enthralling programme of music drawn from our standard repertoire and from the album itself! The event will be on the 12th November, and you can find more information on the performance here: <a href=""'From%20Granada%20to%20Buenos%20Aires'"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://conwayhall.org.uk/event/from-granada-to-buenos-aires/</a></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Unfortunately in today's tough climate, release costs are significantly higher than they used to be and artists regularly have to put up these costs themselves. Whilst we've personally funded over <b>£5,300 </b>of the album, we need external support from here onwards to make sure our investment goes as far as possible. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In return for your generous help we're offering some fantastic pledge rewards to make you a part of what we're doing!</span></p>

</div><p></p></div>","Hi there!


We're Duo Diez, and we need your help to make our album come to life...




'Duo Diez' is an innovative and eclectic musical collaboration between guitarist Dimitris Dekavallas and violinist Violeta Barrena. Since meeting at the Royal Academy of Music as students back in 2005, we discovered a shared interest in playing and promoting Spanish, Ladino and Latin American classical music. We decided to work together in 2012, and this signalled the beginning of Duo Diez.

Since then, we've been performing and touring all over the world and have loved every minute of it. However somehow in the whole three years we've been playing together, we never actually released an album... until now.

'From Granada to Buenos Aires'
Our debut album 'From Granada to Buenos Aires' was recorded with Grammy Award-winning producer James MacMillan in his home studio in Hastings, and features 18 varied and exciting tracks. These are drawn from our musical roots in Latin-American and Spanish and Ladino folk music and also feature some of our own compositions and arrangements as well.


Even more excitingly, we've booked the major London Venue of Conway Hall to launch our album with a enthralling programme of music drawn from our standard repertoire and from the album itself! The event will be on the 12th November, and you can find more information on the performance here: http://conwayhall.org.uk/event/from-granada-to-buenos-aires/
Unfortunately in today's tough climate, release costs are significantly higher than they used to be and artists regularly have to put up these costs themselves. Whilst we've personally funded over £5,300 of the album, we need external support from here onwards to make sure our investment goes as far as possible. In return for your generous help we're offering some fantastic pledge rewards to make you a part of what we're doing!
So to sum up our pitch, we are asking for funding for three key points:

1. Organising a Tour to promote the album2. Venue Hire for a follow-up event3. Marketing and PR Costs

And a more detailed breakdown:

We need to raise a total of £2,000 to organise a US Tour
Another £2,000 to cover hire and promotion costs for one of London's top venues - such as St. John's, Smith Square, Cadogan Hall or the Purcell Room.

On top of this, we need a budget of £1,000 to spend on professional marketing and PR throughout the rest of the next year. This will help us develop as artists
The remaining £1,000 should cover campaign costs (including Indiegogo's commission) with a small amount of contingency funding.


Even more excitingly, we've booked the major London Venue Conway Hall to launch our album with a enthralling programme of music, drawn from our standard repertoire and from the album itself.

What We Have Already Invested

This project is not something that we've only just started making - we've been working on this since October 2014, and have invested significant amounts of money into this project as an ensemble to ensure that we have a level basis to produce the most professional product possible.

We raised £1,000 ourselves to record the album

£1,000 spent to commission 3 exclusive bonus tracks from composers

£600 to record the bonus tracks at a very high budget studio, utilising a top engineer (as a particularly incredible favour!)

£2,000 for the hire, event management and promotion of our Album Launch event at Conway Hall

£700 for the printing costs of the physical album



The Impact


The essence of being a recording artist is that in the 21st century, the biggest record labels hold diminishing influence over the music industry. Physical CD sales are far lower than they used to be and if you don't have the means to invest in marketing yourself, it is very difficult to reach a large enough audience.  
That's where you come in. 
By backing us today you will enable us to take our music to the next level! We will be able to go on tour, perform to more people and have the freedom to focus on perfecting our music rather than worrying constantly about how to pay the bills. It would be a life-changing, and indeed a career-changing difference.







We've also secured a worldwide distribution deal for our album with the innovative Demerara Records, who are specialists in working with New Music and who operate solely as an online-based label. They are a fantastic example of how a label can work 'against the grain' with enormous success and we're delighted to be working with them on this project.

Risks & Challenges

<p><b>The Man Behind the Music </b></p>
<p>My name is Rob LaFond, I’m a songwriter and a musician. I can’t stop writing songs. I have been playing music since I was a little kid, hammering out notes on my uncle’s Wurlitzer electric piano. Throughout my teens, I would stay up for nights, writing music and penning lyrics - every word helping me discover myself and find purpose. However, I thought I couldn’t sing. I couldn’t. But something pushed me to keep doing it. I started to find my own unique voice. It was then that I realized, being a great artist is not about being better than everyone else. It’s about contributing to a larger conversation and expressing yourself freely. </p>
<p>After completing two albums, I’m super pumped to announce that I am hard at work planning the next steps to create more music to inspire you to find and develop your inner voice. Right now I am working on a trilogy of EPs. I have already released the first EP “When We Fly” but now I need YOUR help to produce the next one, “High and Low.” When the trilogy is complete, each title will come together to make a complete sentence:</p>
<p><b>“When We Fly High and Low…”</b></p>
<p>I’m so excited about these songs. This project will help tell the story. I started writing these while driving across the country from Boston to LA. My eyes were wide and filled with possibility. I found an apartment in Silverlake where I started writing and recording the demos. Songs that I wrote years ago are just starting to make sense to me now. </p>
<p>I’ve been down many roads from Boston to LA</p>
<p>Seen the sun shine so bright and I’ve seen it rain for days</p>
<p>Stood upon the mountain and looked down at the Sea</p>
<p>Seen my reflection and didn’t know it was me</p>
<p>On a springtime in LA</p>
<p>By supporting this initiative, you can help me not only create my music, but help me reach a larger audience. </p>
<p><b>This is where you come in…</b></p>
<p>I am humbly asking for the support of my community in order to produce, record and promote this EP. All the people that have been listening to my music, coming out to the shows and backing my career thus far, THANK YOU! You have meant the world to me. </p>
<p>This next phase is sure to be a success and I am inviting you to become a part of the process. </p>
<p>Your financial support will go towards studio time, hiring a producer, mixing engineers, studio musicians, mastering engineers, radio trackers, a music video, hiring a publicist and eventually, help cover the actual duplication of the album when it’s ready to be in tangible form! </p>
<p>I have teamed up with some incredible people to offer you exclusive perks. The incredible artist, Joey Feldman has jumped on board to offer exclusive original prints for some of you lucky supporters! For aspiring songwriters and musicians, I was able to get Raymond Richard (who will be producing this album) on board to mix and master a song for you for a donation of only $350. </p>
<p>For music enthusiasts and entertainment lovers - you have the chance to book my band, for a house concert or private party of your choice. </p>
<p><b>This will be a success</b></p>
<p>I have a very distinct vision for this which I am really excited to share with you. I’ve spent the last year and half playing these songs with my bands in front of many audiences and have really honed my skills. I’ve spent time doing vocal lessons, practicing, performing, working on song lyrics and jotting down melodies. This is a fully thought out idea. Everything down to the T-shirt has a succinct artist vision.</p>
<p>Moving from the East to the West Coast has really helped build my character and my experience in the music industry. I know what it is like, day in and day out, as I spend my days working at KCRW, working with artists in the business. </p>
<p>For the past year, I have been playing all around LA and networking with other musicians. A huge majority of these shows, I produced. Part of my vision is to connect with other artists and build a true arts community where we can all share our creations, express our true emotions and be better individuals. </p>
<p>On the musical side, I have sharpened my skills and proved my diversity by playing all of the instruments on my debut album “Shadows in the Room” (which was self recorded in 2007). </p>
<p>My second recording, which is the start to this series “When We Fly,” came out in March of 2014 and received radio play at KCRW in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>With your support, I know the second part of this trilogy will ‘fly high’ and take my career to the next level. I am inviting you to become a part of my creative process and make it possible. Please help me see my creative vision through.</p>
<p><b>Be a Part of the Story!</b></p>
<p>Check out the perks and be sure to grab your copy of the EP before we even start the recording process. Don’t have any extra funds this month? That’s ok - beyond the money, we need your help spreading the word, so please share this on your Facebook, Twitter and social media channels - every little bit helps!</p>
<p>Once again - Thank you!!!</p>

Seen the sun shine so bright and I’ve seen it rain for days
Stood upon the mountain and looked down at the Sea
Seen my reflection and didn’t know it was me
On a springtime in LA
By supporting this initiative, you can help me not only create my music, but help me reach a larger audience. 
This is where you come in…
I am humbly asking for the support of my community in order to produce, record and promote this EP. All the people that have been listening to my music, coming out to the shows and backing my career thus far, THANK YOU! You have meant the world to me. 
This next phase is sure to be a success and I am inviting you to become a part of the process. 
Your financial support will go towards studio time, hiring a producer, mixing engineers, studio musicians, mastering engineers, radio trackers, a music video, hiring a publicist and eventually, help cover the actual duplication of the album when it’s ready to be in tangible form! 
I have teamed up with some incredible people to offer you exclusive perks. The incredible artist, Joey Feldman has jumped on board to offer exclusive original prints for some of you lucky supporters! For aspiring songwriters and musicians, I was able to get Raymond Richard (who will be producing this album) on board to mix and master a song for you for a donation of only $350. 
For music enthusiasts and entertainment lovers - you have the chance to book my band, for a house concert or private party of your choice. 
This will be a success
I have a very distinct vision for this which I am really excited to share with you. I’ve spent the last year and half playing these songs with my bands in front of many audiences and have really honed my skills. I’ve spent time doing vocal lessons, practicing, performing, working on song lyrics and jotting down melodies. This is a fully thought out idea. Everything down to the T-shirt has a succinct artist vision.
Moving from the East to the West Coast has really helped build my character and my experience in the music industry. I know what it is like, day in and day out, as I spend my days working at KCRW, working with artists in the business. 
For the past year, I have been playing all around LA and networking with other musicians. A huge majority of these shows, I produced. Part of my vision is to connect with other artists and build a true arts community where we can all share our creations, express our true emotions and be better individuals. 
On the musical side, I have sharpened my skills and proved my diversity by playing all of the instruments on my debut album “Shadows in the Room” (which was self recorded in 2007). 
My second recording, which is the start to this series “When We Fly,” came out in March of 2014 and received radio play at KCRW in Los Angeles. 
With your support, I know the second part of this trilogy will ‘fly high’ and take my career to the next level. I am inviting you to become a part of my creative process and make it possible. Please help me see my creative vision through.
Be a Part of the Story!
Check out the perks and be sure to grab your copy of the EP before we even start the recording process. Don’t have any extra funds this month? That’s ok - beyond the money, we need your help spreading the word, so please share this on your Facebook, Twitter and social media channels - every little bit helps!
Once again - Thank you!!!

</div></div>","UPDATE: Market EP production will start in December 2015. Pre-production phase is almost done!


I'm Nicolas Eddowes, a 20 years old Singer/Songwriter from Lima, Peru who writes indie pop music with rock, funk, and folk elements. 

I had the idea of making an album a long time ago, and I have written many songs and the songs for ""Supermarket"" are available for you to listen below in its demo phase (go straight to the ""Songs"" part). Some of the artists that influenced me the most are: Regina Spektor, Ingrid Michaelson, Of Monsters and Men, Foster The People, Lykke Li, Miss Li, Gossling, La Roux, and Bruno Mars


I intend to improve every song greatly before releasing the album. Look at this demos:






Listen to my band Demo here (Spotify) 

Listen a Demo from my album (Spotify)




During my summer vacation this year, I got to work in the USA and got a lot of experience, but I had negative stuff too. This inspired me to write music, and only with the GarageBand app the ideas started to flow.






""Supermarket"" consists of 8 tracks, out of which seven are songs, and one is a little introduction. You can listen what I already have. Keep in mind that all of the songs still need to be polished. 

 
Every person involved is being supportive with the budget. I already own a little equipment at home, but obviously there's a lot more work to be done. I'm at the stage where I'm pulling everything together taking the project from my phone to a computer to work with a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).
I have the songs, the ideas, and a team of people who are willing to help me. Let's talk about costs




I've chosen to use drums samplers, to get a professional, clean sound without the hassle of the edition process.
A recording engineer (Robert Chavez) will take care of this process. He'll be really involved with the production too. The album will have a real drum sound. He will charge $200 for programming drums for 5 songs.



I have a cousin who is a musician (Gustavo Villegas), who plays with many bands (Paramusicales, Cocaina...) and has experience working in studios. He owns a home studio and has everything required to record bass tracks. 

We'll use an audio interface with a direct box.



You can listen to his band's EP here (Spotify)


Gustavo will also help me record the electric and acoustic guitar lines. For the electric guitar, we'll use a direct box and an audio interface as well. For the acoustic guitar, we'll work with a condenser microphone and an interface in a quiet space.
He's charging me $180 for all of this work.




Gisela Perez-Ruibal is a professional piano player and she's going to do both parts. As we'll work with MIDI for some tracks, we are going to do piano parts, synthesizer parts, even strings in this process. A keyboard will be plugged through the audio interface and a USB cable (MIDI) to record. Arrangements will cost $240 ($30 per track).


You can listen to her work here (Spotify)




Orchestral Programming, in this case. This is going to be easily achieved with Miroslav Philharmonic. It sounds really good and practically there's no additional monetary investing in this part, it's included in the arrangements.

I'll probably do most of the vocals (if not all of them) for each song, even backing vocals. The tracks should be recorded in a professional studio, to get the best quality possible. The average price for recording voice in a studio is $30 an hour. I'm assuming I'll need around five two hours sessions, which would mean I'd need $300 for recording sessions. However, this is by no means fixed: it could take more or less sessions to finish recording.



I've decided to use one service with a great price and quality. You can check the service here. It includes Mastering on its prices. I'm using his album mix rate for 6 songs ($240), and for the singles I will be using the single song mix with 33-48 tracks rate ($110 each). That's a total of $460 for mixing and mastering.
UPDATE: Costs will be similar since I've decided to release an EP first, I would take the 3 song EP rate ($190), and the 5 song rate ($260), making a new total of $450 for mixing and mastering.

All I need is good photo session and some text, and for this I would spend only $50 for the photography and design (including singles and album artworks).


(not final artwork)

To do this I'm using CD Baby. It lets you to get your music on every digital platform and even physical copies.
 For this they charge $14,95 for each single (9,95 per song + 5 for an UPC barcode) and $69 for each album (49 per album + 20 for an UPC barcode) you release. I'm planning on releasing 2 singles and the album, which would come to $83,95.
UPDATE: Since I'm releasing an EP instead of individual singles, consider two album releases rates ($69 times 2 = $138, compared to the $83,95 previous total)


UPDATED!I need to stick to a short list because of the low-budget project.
Stuff like Digital downloads, CDs, Vinyls, Posters and T-shirts will be given depending on how much you pledge, don't forget to look at the perks I've prepared
Feel free to suggest any other reward and I'll definitely look into it.

                                                       anything you want for a Bonus Track


If I get to my funding goal, Supermarket would be done as described previously. If I don't reach the goal, I'd have to record the songs I can afford with that amount. But, If I exceed the goal, then I'll probably add more songs to the album,  spend more on production (so I can have an even better product), and I might even consider making a Deluxe Edition!
Considering this is an album, and music production can be really expensive, why do I need so little money compared to other artists? I'm recording with my own equipment and with people I already know, which makes it cheaper. I'm working on the stuff I need, but the money I already have for the project won't be enough to record and mix every song.

Mixing original materials and original music with things taken from corporately owned mass culture and the world around them, Negativland re-arranges these found bits and pieces to make them say and suggest things that they never intended to. In doing this kind of cultural archaeology and “culture jamming” (a term they coined way back in 1984), Negativland have been sued twice for copyright infringement.</p><p>Over the years Negativland’s “illegal” collage and appropriation-based audio and visual works have touched on many things – pranks, media hoaxes, advertising, media literacy, religion, the evolving art of collage, the bizarre banality of suburban existence, creative anti-corporate activism in a media-saturated and multi-national world, file sharing, intellectual property issues, wacky surrealism, evolving notions of art and ownership and law in a digital age, and artistic and humorous observations of mass media and mass culture.</p><p>While it is true that, after being sued, Negativland became more publicly involved in advocating significant reforms of our nation’s copyright laws (more recently finding themselves being brought to Washington DC and Capitol Hill as citizen lobbyists for copyright and art issues), Negativland are artists first and activists second. All of their art and media interventions have intended to pose both serious and silly questions about the nature of sound, media, control, ownership, propaganda and perception in the United States of America. Their work is now referenced and taught in many college courses in the US, has been written about and mentioned in over 150 books (including “No Logo” by Naomi Klein, “Media Virus” by Douglas Rushkoff, and various biographies of the band U2), cited in legal journals, and they often lecture about their work here and in Europe.</p><p>Since 1981, Negativland and an evolving cast of characters have operated “Over The Edge,” a weekly radio show on KPFA FM in Berkeley, California. “Over The Edge” continues to broadcast three hours of live, found-sound mixing every Thursday at midnight, West Coast time, also streamed online. In 1995 they released a 270-page book with 72-minute CD entitled “Fair Use: The Story of the Letter U and the Numeral 2,” documenting their infamous four-year long legal battle over their 1991 release of an audio piece entitled “U2”. They were the subjects of Craig Baldwin’s 1995 feature documentary “Sonic Outlaws” and created the soundtrack and sound design for Harold Boihem’s 1997 documentary film “The Ad And The Ego,” an excellent in-depth look into the hidden agendas of the corporate ad world and the ways that we are affected by advertising. In 2004 Negativland worked with Creative Commons to write the Creative Commons Sampling License, an alternative to existing copyrights that is now widely used by many artists, writers, musicians, film makers, and websites. In 2005, they released the elaborately packaged “No Business” (with CD, 15,000-word essay, and custom-made whoopie cushion), and debuted “Negativlandland” – a large visual art show of over 80 pieces of their “fine art” works, videos, home-made electronic devices, and a life-sized animatronic Abe Lincoln robot, at New York City’s Gigantic Art Space. That art exhibit continues to change and evolve and has traveled around the country, showing in Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis, Houston, and Richmond, VA.</p><p>In 2007, Negativland released “Our Favorite Things”, a feature-length DVD collection of their many years of collaborative film work, and in 2008 they surprised themselves and everybody else by putting out a toe-tapping all-songs project of one member’s compositions called “Negativland Presents Thigmotactic,” and they continue to occasionally visit Washington DC as citizen lobbyists.</p><p>More recently, Negativland has been performing a show of radically new audio-visual versions of many Negativland fan-favorites that have never before been heard live. Negativland’s current performance project, entitled “Content!,” finds them teaming up with electronic musician Wobbly, and “live cinema” video artist Steev Hise, to create a visual and sonic performance that reinvents favorite past and present dialog cut-ups, while showcasing Negativland’s homemade electronic noise-making devices that they call “Boopers,” and relying heavily on group improvisation.</p><p>And in 2014, for their first new audio release in six years, “It’s All In Your Head” finds the group tackling their biggest subject ever: God.  This ambitious and densely-crafted double CD is packaged inside an actual King James Holy Bible which has been appropriately repurposed into a “found” art object. Negativland mixes found music, found sound, found dialogue, guest personalities and original electronic noises into a compelling and thoughtful musical essay on monotheism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, neuroscience, suicide bombers, 9/11, colas, war, shaved chimps, and the all-important role played by the human brain in our beliefs. The audio is presented as a live radio broadcast (modeled after the “Over the Edge” radio program). This theater-of-the-mind project has been assembled from basic tracks recorded live in front of blindfolded studio audiences, and documents the unique style of live collage performances that Negativland has been presenting on stages, and on radio, since the formation of the group in 1980.</p><div>

<p><b>BIG TIME MEDIA QUOTES ABOUT NEGATIVLAND’S WORK THAT MAKE THEM SOUND LEGIT- </b></p>
<p>Declared heroic by their peers for refashioning culture into what the group considers to be more honest statements, Negativland suggests that refusing to be original, in the traditional sense, is the only way to make art that has any depth within commodity capitalism…</p>
<p>– NEW YORK TIMES</p>
<p>Negativland isn’t just some group of merry pranksters; its art is about tearing apart and reassembling found images, objects, and sounds to create new ones, in an attempt to make social, political and artistic statements. Hilarious and chilling.</p>
<p>– THE ONION</p>
<p>It’s an often ignored request, but you may pay more attention to the phrase “Please remember to take all your belongings” after seeing Negativland’s eerily mesmerizing new project…</p>

This theater-of-the-mind project has been assembled from basic tracks recorded live in front of blindfolded studio audiences, and documents the unique style of live collage performances that Negativland has been presenting on stages, and on radio, since the formation of the group in 1980.
  
BIG TIME MEDIA QUOTES ABOUT NEGATIVLAND’S WORK THAT MAKE THEM SOUND LEGIT- 
Declared heroic by their peers for refashioning culture into what the group considers to be more honest statements, Negativland suggests that refusing to be original, in the traditional sense, is the only way to make art that has any depth within commodity capitalism…
– NEW YORK TIMES
Negativland isn’t just some group of merry pranksters; its art is about tearing apart and reassembling found images, objects, and sounds to create new ones, in an attempt to make social, political and artistic statements. Hilarious and chilling.
– THE ONION
It’s an often ignored request, but you may pay more attention to the phrase “Please remember to take all your belongings” after seeing Negativland’s eerily mesmerizing new project…
– NEWSWEEK
Negativland is arguably the preeminent audio collage collective of our time.
– HI FRUCTOSE
Negativland argues persuasively that creators should be able to appropriate bits and pieces of anything and incorporate then into their work without fear of legal action.
– UTNE READER
Negativland, longtime advocates of fair use allowances for pop media collage, are perhaps America’s most skilled plunderers from the detritus of 20th century commercial culture…the band’s latest project is razor sharp, microscopically focused, terribly fun and a bit psychotic.
– WIRED MAGAZINE
For more than 20 years, Negativland has earned renown for manipulation of both tape and media.
– LOS ANGELES TIMES
Collage pioneers…..genre-defying, densely layered, strangely accessible…..
– WASHINGTON POST
Negativland…known for their media pranks….
– TIME MAGAZINE
Negativland are at it again…a parody of soft drink marketing.
– ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY
Scathing and entertaining…they believe that the sheer volume of advertising is degrading to the mental and physical environment
– BUSINESS WEEK
A provocation and a punk-inspired commentary on our mercenary culture…eloquent and impassioned spokesmen for ideas like a “creative commons”…it’s salutary to see these smart and influential guys get a gallery show.
– ART IN AMERICA
Fearless artistes or foolhardy risk-takers….by constantly haranguing the listener with authentic advertising spiel and highlighting its transparency, they kill the messenger, kill the message and produce highly entertaining art simultaneously.
– L.A. WEEKLY
Musical-collage pioneers…..genre-defying, densely layered, strangely accessible…..
– URB
Twisted genius…compelling…..parody and satire as a grass roots weapon of consumer resistance.
– ROLLING STONE
The band hilariously juxtapose and layer sound bites and jingles…to help their targets hang themselves. What if the Pepsi execs actually like the album?

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>lightcraft is a five-piece indie-rock/dream-pop band from Jakarta, Indonesia, a land that is rife with corruption and political chaos. We make music that comes straight from the heart, derived from our respective experiences in life, music that is melancholic yet anthemic, which aims to tug your heartstrings and lift you up at the same time. After meeting each other during their university days in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, lightcraft was formed in 2004. By 2006, we released an EP titled ""The Modern Seasons"", which caught the eye of the local music scene. In 2008, a debut album followed, called ""Losing Northern Lights"". After a series of line-up changes, they finally reconvened in their hometown of Jakarta, and proceeded to officially unveil their sophomore album, ""Colours Of Joy"", in January 2014.</p>
<p>lightcraft has performed at shows and festivals in a number of countries across South-East Asia, including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. In 2014, the band managed to play the prestigious Baybeats Music Festival 2014 in Singapore, as well as Java Soundsfair 2014 in Jakarta, Indonesia. In January 2015, lightcraft played their first-ever show on Indian shores - and their first outside of South-East Asia - when they performed at Saarang 2015 in Chennai, India. Before they went to India, however, they were notified of something very monumental in their musical journey so far: lightcraft was invited to perform at Canadian Music Week 2015.</p>
<p>We were shocked, to say the least. Our dream was to spread our wings as wide as possible, and suddenly, we were given the opportunity to do so at a music festival that is rich in history; recognised as one of the best music events in North America, and indeed, the world. This could be the big break that we need, and on a larger scale, what the Indonesian music industry needs. This year - having been going on for 33 years - Canadian Music Week (or CMW) is set to showcase the likes of The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, John Mellencamp, Alvvays, Lights, Colbie Caillat, Ben Lee, and many more, all descending upon Toronto and performing across ten days from May 1-10, 2015 in various venues dotted around the city. For lightcraft to be chosen among them as a representative of Indonesia is a very big deal indeed, both for us and for our country.<br/></p>
<p>Thus, what we would like to ask of you is this: help us get there, help us fulfil the dreams of many and help us open the door for our fellow compatriots in the Indonesian music industry so that we can show the world what we're made of. We need you to help fund our flight tickets and accommodation costs, so that we could fulfil the invitation to perform at Canadian Music Week 2015; so that we could make Indonesia proud; so that we could help place Indonesia under the global spotlight as a force to be reckoned with in terms of our music industry.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We're going to be very straightforward here: the amount we need that we've calculated to get us to fly out to Toronto, Canada and bag an adequate place to stay is approximately US$10,000. That amount will cover all five members of the band's return flight tickets from Jakarta to Toronto and back, as well as accommodation for ten days, but if we could raise at least US$8,000 from you via Indiegogo, then we'll be more than happy. Why will we be there for the whole duration of Canadian Music Week 2015, you ask? Because besides playing showcases that are organised by CMW 2015, we will also be playing shows outside of the festival, and if things go as planned, we shall be performing in a couple of cities around Toronto, including Mississauga and Hamilton. We've also made plans to follow all the seminars and talks that will be part of the festival, so that we could learn a lot of stuff about the music industry on a global scale and bring back home that priceless knowledge and apply that to the local music industry in Indonesia.</p>
<p>To be honest, we wouldn't be able to afford half of the total amount of money on our monthly wages alone, let alone the full US$8,000. That's why we need your help. But don't worry, as there are a few rewards in store for those of you who have parted with their hard-earned money to assist in our cause: social media mentions, handwritten postcards, pins, t-shirts, CDs, your name mentioned in our next album credits, signed merchandise and more!</p>
<p>If all does not go to plan, the funds that you have pledged will be partially donated to a charity of your choice, while the rest of it will be used to fund the recording sessions of our next album, which we are planning on releasing in early 2016. So we assure you that your money will not go to waste!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Imagine the possibilities that could happen if your contributions were to successfully get us to Toronto, Canada for Canadian Music Week 2015. It could spell a new era for the Indonesian music industry; an industry that is brimming with untapped talents. It could also help in putting Indonesia under the global spotlight as a country. People will definitely notice what Indonesian musicians can do, and people will finally discover what Indonesia is really like: a developing country with cultural heritage and creative minds that could help in changing the world for the better. You won't just be giving lightcraft a helping hand; you'll be helping a whole country. And we promise that we will try our best to make what we've just said a reality, because it is possible.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Let's face it: there will be hundreds of acts that will be playing Canadian Music Week 2015 armed with the same aims as we are, and they're there because they're awesome. Your funds, however, will prove to be a major help as we try our darnedest to get ourselves noticed while we're there; so that we are able to deliver on our promises.</p>
<p>The second risk that we may face is show cancellations. As you might've noticed, many gigs have fallen victim to getting cancelled due to various reasons, be they floods, fire, cancelled flights and more. We sincerely hope that none of them will happen when we get there, but we just want you to understand that there's always those risks lingering around.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute for some reason, hey, we understand. But what you can do, though, is to help us spread the word about our campaign. Tell your family, relatives, friends, work colleagues, football teammates, and anybody else that you could think of, and get them to pledge to our cause or spread the word as well!</p>

    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute for some reason, hey, we understand. But what you can do, though, is to help us spread the word about our campaign. Tell your family, relatives, friends, work colleagues, football teammates, and anybody else that you could think of, and get them to pledge to our cause or spread the word as well!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who We Are<br/>
</h3>
<p>Formed in 2007, after the onset of the Saffron Rebellion, The Rebel Riot has been using music to fight against 
injustice, poverty, harsh censorship laws, and violent government
 crackdowns. In a country where the average musician struggles to get 
their hands on an instrument, let alone practice, The Rebel Riot has 
given a voice to those who are angry, frustrated, and disenchanted with 
the injustice around them, while creating an outlet to work for social 
change by any means possible; for example, by playing shows to raise 
money for different causes, caring for
 the disenfranchised, like HIV positive children and the mentally ill, feeding the homeless during weekly Food Not Bombs donation 
nights, and exposing the harsh living conditions 
and 
human rights violations of the Burmese people. <br/></p>""Dressing in Punk style is a serious act of rebellion in Burma where 
most men still wear traditional dress...even in the economic capital 
Yangon (formerly Rangoon). But for the band Rebel Riot--- a leading force in the 
small punk scene ---punk is far more than just a superficial copy of its 
Western counterpart. Here, what is probably the most rebellious of all 
subcultures in the Southeast Asian country is going up against one of 
the world's most authoritarian regimes. Punk gives young Burmese a 
chance to symbolically spit in the face of the hated government, which 
took power in 2010 in the wake of what was widely considered a 
fraudulent election. Although the government has shown initial signs of 
greater open-mindedness, which included the release of political 
prisoners in recent months, Burma is still far from a state that 
embraces the rule of law (<a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/rotten-vicious-times-burma-s-punk-scene-fights-repression-underground-a-817185.html)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/r...</a>"".<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3> <p>We regularly play shows to raise awareness about the Burmese government and our work with Food Not Bombs (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/fnbmyanmar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/fnbmyanmar</a>). Unfortunately, while we've had the chance to release two E.Ps (Puppet Society [2013] and Fuck Religious Rules [2014]), we still cannot afford our own 
instruments (we make about $65 USD a month). As a result, we need to save all our money just to rent them ($200 USD for 4 hrs!) and a place to
 practice, while still fighting for opportunities to play shows – a harsh 
reality not just for punks, but all musicians in Burma. This campaign will help us to raise the money to buy the instruments and gear that us and our community can use to play shows and spread our message to as many people as possible.<br/></p> <ul> <li>We priced out the gear at the local music shop, here in Rangoon, and it comes to about $4500 USD plus tax (and indiegogo fees).</li>

</h3> <p>My name is Jennifer Bellor and I am a composer who is passionate about producing music that crosses boundaries between contemporary classical, jazz, rock, and hip hop. I write music for big band, opera, large ensemble, small ensemble, dancers and artists. I have enjoyed so many wonderful opportunities along the way collaborating with talented musicians and artists from diverse musical and artistic backgrounds. </p>

As an undergraduate at Cornell University, I began pursuing composition. This project will encompass and enhance my composition of the music, and my performance as a vocalist.<br/><br/>My passion to bring musicians from various backgrounds together started with musical relationships created with friends and colleagues back when I was studying at Eastman School of Music. In 2009, The New Jazz Ensemble Director Dave Rivello approached me about writing a piece for his ensemble, and I was inspired and encouraged to take pieces  that I wrote for a classical ensemble and create alternate versions. I was hooked; creating music that incorporates improvisation with my style of music was exactly what I wanted to do artistically. I experimented with different styles and instrumentation, and continued 
on an exciting path collaborating with musicians who were equally 
enthusiastic with what I was doing. <br/><br/>
<p>This is an mp3 of a recording from a performance of a piece originally written for jazz players, then arranged to combine both jazz and classical: jazz trumpet, string quartet, vibraphone, piano, bass, and drums. Jazz trumpet player Mike Kaupa approached me about writing this piece for him and his colleagues at Eastman School of Music in 2012. This piece is titled ""Out of the Shadows"":</p>

<p><cite></cite>Currently residing in Las Vegas, while teaching at UNLV, I have another opportunity for my growth as an artist; sharing ideas and collaborating with and getting to know the musicians. Last May, in a discussion with a fellow composer, I was introduced to the short story by Charles Baudelaire titled, ""The Generous Gambler"", and  encouraged to create a concept album based loosely off the story. While envisioning what my own concept album would be, I re-listened to some influences of mine such as Wax Tailor and Pink Floyd. I revised older pieces, composed new ones, and incorporated compositions like ""Out of the Shadows"". The album will be a tour through different levels of her own faults and desires. This is a recording from the first rehearsal of ""Familiar Stranger"" involving UNLV musicians.

<p>This summer was spent composing and planning out how, when and where I will record. I will be using both the UNLV and Eastman studios to record. After rehearsals , December 4-6 will be the days I will record with UNLV musicians. Over winter break I will be traveling to Rochester, NY in order to record with Eastman musicians the pieces that involve jazz improvisation.  The pieces have varied instrumentation, ranging from smaller ensemble pieces featuring soprano, piano, electric guitar and bass, to larger ones that feature voice, string quartet, woodwinds, percussion and a rapper.</p>
<p>Creating an album has been a longtime dream of mine, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to share and create my music with such wonderful musicians here in Las Vegas and in Rochester, NY. In order to complete this album, I need to make sure that I have the
necessary funding for: time in the recording studios, mixing, and fair compensation for the talented performers taking time to
prepare and record my music.

<p>Please help me in making my dream a reality by contributing in any way you are able, whether it be by donation or sharing with your friends on social media. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In my discussions with the UNLV and Eastman recording studios, I found that in order for me to successfully record all thirteen tracks on my album,  mix each track, and compensate the 21  performers, I will need to raise at least $10,000.  After recording, I will spend the majority of winter break and early spring working with sound engineers to mix the recordings. <br/></p>

With our 11th season, we're Looking Forward: expanding our reach to new locations such as Baltimore's War Memorial, adding to our repertoire with new pieces and new productions, and searching out new ways to present the important music being created right in this moment in time to new audiences. GNE has worked hard during its first ten years to create a firm foothold in the cultural life of the nation's capitol, and has succeeded in providing excellent productions of wonderful and rarely-heard masterworks of modern music, from large ensemble pieces such as Louis Andriessen's  De Materie and La Commedia to smaller yet equally important and engaging pieces like Martin Bresnick's Pine Eyes and Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians. Equally important is our mission of promoting the works of composers who are building careers or who have already started to make their mark on the new music world such as GNE members Armando Bayolo, Mark Sylvester, Kevin McKee, and Blair Goins as well as longtime GNE friends and collaborators like Robert Paterson, D.J.

</strong><h3>Puedes ser parte de Travelling!</h3>
<h3>Mi pasión por la música se inició desde que, en mis primeros días de vida, escuchaba a mi abuelo, Oscar Gacitúa, tocar al piano Chopin, Beethoven, Bach, Schubert y la música de los grandes maestros en la sala de mi casa. La fuerza emocional de esta música me llevó a mi segunda gran pasión, el teatro. Junto a la Compañía Tryo Teatro Banda he podido vivir la fusión de ellas, en obras que han sido vistas por miles de personas como La Expulsión de los Jesuitas, La Tirana, Afrochileno y La Araucana, y junto al director Cristián Plana en las obras Comida Alemana, Castigo, Paso del Norte y Almagro. En el cine también he podido expresarlas, cantando en la película El Club, de Pablo Larraín y actuando y cantando en Te amo, made in Chile, y Perla, de Sergio Castilla. </h3>
<p>La composición musical siempre me acompañó y hace tres años lancé mi primer disco, Still Me, iniciando mi camino solista. Mi universo musical se ha ido nutriendo de diversos lenguajes, popular medieval, celta, rock, pop, folk, que hoy se plasman en canciones que integrarán mi segundo trabajo, Travelling, trabajando con maravillosos músicos chilenos como Tata Barahona y Jorge Matamala de Calenda Maia, Marcelo Córdova, Esteban Sumar, Andrés Pérez, Pedro Foncea, Daniel Baeza y Roberto Gacitúa, entre otros. </p>
<p><strong>Porqué Necesito tu Contribución?</strong></p>
<p>He querido grabar este segundo disco con los más altos estándares artísticos y técnicos, por eso, junto al Sello Discográfica del Sur haremos el registro en Estudios del Sur, uno de los mejores a nivel continental. </p>
<p>El financiamiento de este proyecto contempla un monto final de U$ 8.000 que considera honorarios de los músicos (U$ 1.500), costo Estudios del Sur (grabación, mezcla y masterización U$ 4.000), Reproducción Copias del Disco (U$ 2.500).</p>
<p>Todos estos costos son asumidos por mí y te invito a ayudarme a financiar este sueño. </p>
<p><strong>Cuál es el Aporte de mi Música?</strong></p>
<p>Este disco significa mucho para mí, refleja una maduración en mi creación y lo realizaré a todo evento, porque tengo la convicción de que será un aporte en la escena musical chilena ya que logra una fusión de diversos lenguajes musicales que enriquecen el sonido del rock y el pop, columnas vertebrales de mi propuesta.  </p>

My name is CAMM, I'm a Hip Hop artist, songwriter, and producer born and raised in the Home of the Blues, (Memphis, TN). I  bring a refreshing and soulful sound to the genre by resurrecting traditional Hip Hop influences such as A Tribe Called Quest and Biggie and incorporating elements of Pop, Soul, Jazz, and Gospel music. I just want to create and tell stories in ways they've never been told before. As the son of a pastor, I got my start in the church. My gift as a musician and an artist were discovered and flourished there. But instead of pursuing Gospel music, I wanted to make an impactful splash on the Hip Hop industry. I'm gospel, not in the sense that I sing or write gospel music, but that I bring good news. I'm going against the usual grain of ""money, hoes, and clothes"" in Hip Hop. My music has and always will project a spirit of fun, love, and consciousness.<p>

<p>“Higher Learning” is my debut album, set for release on January 14th, 2016. It is the culmination of years of development and soul searching for me, as an artist and as a man. “Higher Learning” is a concept album with themes, recurring motifs, and socially relevant issues depicted in many of the 1990s Black Films such as John Singleton’s 1995 classic “Higher Learning”. This album is an opportunity for me to further educate the community on socially relevant issues. It will also serve as an enhancement to the culture of Hip Hop and the usual degree of content spread.</p>

</div></div>","The Goal: Release an amazing FREE album full of music that touches hearts, tells stories, inspires, and brings the jam:  What's good everybody! My name is CAMM, I'm a Hip Hop artist, songwriter, and producer born and raised in the Home of the Blues, (Memphis, TN). I  bring a refreshing and soulful sound to the genre by resurrecting traditional Hip Hop influences such as A Tribe Called Quest and Biggie and incorporating elements of Pop, Soul, Jazz, and Gospel music. I just want to create and tell stories in ways they've never been told before. As the son of a pastor, I got my start in the church. My gift as a musician and an artist were discovered and flourished there. But instead of pursuing Gospel music, I wanted to make an impactful splash on the Hip Hop industry. I'm gospel, not in the sense that I sing or write gospel music, but that I bring good news. I'm going against the usual grain of ""money, hoes, and clothes"" in Hip Hop. My music has and always will project a spirit of fun, love, and consciousness.

</div></div>","I am Shawn Majors, an artist from Kansas City, MO.  This campaign is important to me because it is allowing those that believe in ensuring that Kansas City music stays alive with not only the music that you want to hear but the experience along with it.  Each campaign has something special for each contributor.  Each package comes with a pre-sale copy of the album titled, ""No MOre Love.""  As you enhance your contributions you will experience more and more options to not only to the music but other business ventures that I have pursued and will share with the world.


The album will not only be a music narrative by way of Hip-Hop but a visual by way of short film.  This campaign is to give those that have followed, supported, and look forward to an artist that will not only provide motivation and substance through music but by way of action.  I ensure that the short film will paint a very vivid picture of the culture, our surroundings, what we are doing to move forward, how we continue, and acknowledging those that are making their mark.  It is important to support this movement every step of the way.

Each campaign is designed to support and maintain the movement through music and art, a passion that I feel obligated to share with you.  Support and tell others about your contribution.  Thank you and always remember to Love Yourself!

</p><p>Hello Everyone!  For those of you who don't know me, allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Chip Ratliff, and I am a musician, writer, producer, and speaker born and raised in Chicago, IL.  If you really want to learn more about me, there's all kinds of bio info and opportunities to hear my previous recordings on my website <a href=""http://www.chipratliff.net./"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.chipratliff.net.</span></a></p>
<p><b><i><br/>Inspiration</i></b></p>
<p>Recent events in my life have made me realize that NOW is the time to share my gifts with all of you!  This album brings me back full circle to the reason I started writing and performing: to share MY original music with the world. The album will also serve as a launch pad that will allow me to positively entertain and inspire the global community!  It will consist of new original titles that span across the various musical styles that have influenced me: funk, groove, blues, dance, even some acoustic stuff!</p><p>Here's a sample of previous releases:</p>

<p>I really want this release to have a “live band” feel to it.There’s nothing like the creative energy of musicians in a studio, feeding off each others energy. Since I have had the pleasure and honor of meeting and working with some extremely talented musicians throughout the years. With this album, we are coming together in the studio to record!

<p>Saxophonist Chris Greene </p>

<p>Drummer/Percussionist, Charles “Lil’ Chip” Dubos III</p>
<p>Keyboardist, Tony Cazeau</p>
<p>More musicians TBA!</p>
<p>I’m also hoping the music will inspire young people to play an instrument, be original, and not afraid to create from their heart.

<p></p>
<p>Over 20 years ago, I wasn't a DJ yet, my best friend used to call me Kamikaza for my character. Later, another friend asked me if kamikazas were Japanese Georgians, because it sounds like a mixture of these two languages. I laughed then and loved the idea. So when I've started writing this album it came naturally to call it ""Japanese Georgians"", because all what you are going to hear is very personal.</p>
<p>I think that contemporary music, especially techno, is missing a concept behind it. Nowadays all modern art has become conceptual, but not so many underground musicians are making videos or writing about their creations. This album is different. Every track of the album has its own story and will have its own video as a visualization of emotions I've put in each and everyone of them.</p>
<p>I have several releases already, still a debut album is something special. As I've found a vision and inspiration for my first LP only now, I've put a lot of emotions into the record, as well as all my passion to electronic music as a DJ and music journalist. </p>
<p>I don't want to release the album on big label, as I wish to have a freedom to make design, promotion, videos etc as I see it. So I have chosen my home Platz fur Tanz label. However, being an independent artist without the major funding is not easy.</p>

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>The music you
have just listened on the video is composed by Sergey Akhunov, a
Ukrainian-Russian composer. We are planning this peace of music to be a part of
a new CD, which is to be accomplished by the end of the year. </p>
<p>This
crowdfunding campaign is organised to raise money for the recording of the
piano trio, called “Tchaikovsky”. </p>
<p>I have
composed this trio in June 2014. It was a prestigious commission made by Levitan’s
Festival in Plyos (Russia) , and it is written for violin, cello &amp; piano. A
premiere of the trio became a prominent event of the Levitan’s Festival in
September 2014. Here is a small excerpt from the world premier:</p>

<p>p.s. Here is a small excerpt from Russian critic Anna Kocharova's article for the inside booklet of  Sergey Akhunov - CHAMBER WORKS CD: </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When viewed against the background
of incredible sound experiments, the music of composer Sergey Akhunov (b. 1967)
is traditional. The author uses familiar methods of working with instruments,
and his compositions always manifest a harmonic scale that is distinct and
clear to the ear and have a clear-cut form. The composer himself stresses that the
continuation of traditions and rethinking of what has already been accomplished
is important to him. However, any simplified attitude to himself is the personal
view of the author, which may be too exacting. When speaking of his work as a
composer, Sergey Akhunov stresses that any piece takes on a definite shape only
when he has a revelation and music “comes” to him. This admission is highly
characteristic of his creative work. Fortunately, it is completely devoid of
any opportunism and desire to please the listener and surprise professional
musicians. This music is profoundly sincere and open, which gives it an
undeniable advantage.</p>
<p>However, there is a catch for the
listener in this seeming simplicity, because this simplicity cannot in any way be
equaled to primitiveness. Behind each composition, there is a whole chain of meanings
and associations, poetic lines and picturesque prototypes. Behind the harmony
and transparency of sound, there is the author’s interest in music of the pre-Bach
period. And not only in the pre-Bach period but also in the earlier Greek modes
or scales of music and numerical interval construction theories. Behind his ideas
there are specific performers and friends who have somehow or other influenced
the author. But all of this is only the impetus for composing, by no means providing
us with any definite code for deciphering.</p>

of incredible sound experiments, the music of composer Sergey Akhunov (b. 1967)
is traditional. The author uses familiar methods of working with instruments,
and his compositions always manifest a harmonic scale that is distinct and
clear to the ear and have a clear-cut form. The composer himself stresses that the
continuation of traditions and rethinking of what has already been accomplished
is important to him. However, any simplified attitude to himself is the personal
view of the author, which may be too exacting. When speaking of his work as a
composer, Sergey Akhunov stresses that any piece takes on a definite shape only
when he has a revelation and music “comes” to him. This admission is highly
characteristic of his creative work. Fortunately, it is completely devoid of
any opportunism and desire to please the listener and surprise professional
musicians. This music is profoundly sincere and open, which gives it an
undeniable advantage.
However, there is a catch for the
listener in this seeming simplicity, because this simplicity cannot in any way be
equaled to primitiveness. Behind each composition, there is a whole chain of meanings
and associations, poetic lines and picturesque prototypes. Behind the harmony
and transparency of sound, there is the author’s interest in music of the pre-Bach
period. And not only in the pre-Bach period but also in the earlier Greek modes
or scales of music and numerical interval construction theories. Behind his ideas
there are specific performers and friends who have somehow or other influenced
the author. But all of this is only the impetus for composing, by no means providing
us with any definite code for deciphering.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><p>First of all, THANK YOU. Because you are each individual, invaluable, mighty patrons of the arts (ahhts, in Massachusetts), I have been able to make music for a living, since quitting my day job in 1997. You have come to live shows. You have bought CDs and downloads. You have shared this music with your communities. You have posted and shared music, videos, tourdates and more on social media.</p>
<p>You are, quite literally, the solid frame of the vehicle I exist within, doodling around on the guitar and scratching lyrics into dime store notebooks. Even if you didn't know it. It's You. You. You. Thank you. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Why Are We Here?</h3>
<p>I made you something special: ""<i>Plainfield</i>,"" my best record to date. An intimate, stripped down, solo acoustic, live in the studio recording. <span>With gratitude and humility, </span>I ask you, esteemed patrons, to join me in co-creating, releasing and promoting <span>""<i>Plainfield</i>,""</span> helping it find a footing and new audiences further than previously possible. <br/></p>
<p>I've released seven albums (seven!) with virtually zero budget for serious promotion. Ugh! That's like starting a road trip with an empty tank of gas. In the desert. You're not going to get very far. This time, let's fill the tank and pack all the provisions! Hire a publicist, get a radio promoter on the horn (is that a thing?), sidle up to savvy social media captains, bestie a blogger, cruise a critic (wait, that came out wrong), and promote, promote, promote. <span><span>I've thought up a long list of special perks and one of a kind incentives to add fun, flair and inspiration to the campaign. </span></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>What Makes You So Special, Anyways?</b></h3>
<p>Inspired by the likes of Audre Lorde, bell hooks, James Baldwin, Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Angela Davis and more, I embrace my identity, my duty, my innate responsibility, within the skin I'm in, to speak the truth as I see it. Tagging alongside a lineage of political artists, critical thinkers, and outspoken writers, tirelessly illuminating hidden power structures and institutions of oppression, whether visible, invisible, internal or external. And, although, it may be the road less commercially traveled (um, much less, much much less traveled), I remain committed to this path, this long road, this musical journey. And, it would not be possible, at all, if you weren't there to listen, groove, share, care.</p>

<p>So, patrons of the ahhts, you happen to be the best record label around. A grass roots collection of like-minded individuals in common appreciation of, support for, and encouragement toward outspoken, uncensored art from independent artists who maintain complete control of their work.</p>
<p>This is what the modern music industry looks like. This is how it's done in the 21st century. Let's keep it goin'. Let's do 'dis.

<h3><b>What Are You Gonna Do With All The Money?</b></h3>
<p><span>Right
 off the top, before anybody gets anything, Indiegogo takes 5%, Paypal 
takes another 3 to 5%, and there is an additional 3%+$0.30 in processing
 fees for each credit card transaction. For every 10,000 raised, roughly
 3,000 will go toward fulfilling the rewards. The rest goes toward the 
costs of the project: paying for studio time and the recording engineer;
 musicians and producers (but, in this case, them is me), graphic 
designers, web designers, radio promoters, publicists, videographers, 
and promoting the videos online; plus, design and manufacturing of 
posters, promotional materials and merchandise. The more of a creative 
team's time, energy, and effort I can pay for, the further this record 
will go.</span></p>
<p>""<i>Plainfield</i>"" was, actually, already recorded this summer. It still needs final mixes and mastering. Studio fees have been accruing and still need to be paid. It will cost $8,000 to finish paying for the recording, artwork production and first pressing of CDs alone. The crucial focus of this campaign, hiring the bare minimum publicity team for radio and press, could easily cost $1500-$5000 or more, and in some cases per month! With $20,000 I can extend the publicity campaign, produce a video or two, and promote them online. $30,000 or more will allow me to push harder and even further with a longer PR campaign, and solidify tour support in key regions of the country that are wonderful but expensive to build upon. (West coast!) A stretch goal of $40,000 or more would allow me to tour more in regions where I rarely visit (Southeast, Southwest and the space between Austin and Seattle). And in some cases, I could afford to bring a band on the road! It would be such a thrill and a treat to take a band on the road, but they keep wanting money and food. Whatever. Currently, only the rare New England venue gets to see a full band show. The more we have to work with, the better the chances that this record will reach a wider audience than I have in the past. That's what you will be a part of: sharing this work that you've enjoyed for years out in the wide world. You will make this magic.</p>

PAMELA MEANS 
Plainfield

The new album!


First Things First...

First of all, THANK YOU. Because you are each individual, invaluable, mighty patrons of the arts (ahhts, in Massachusetts), I have been able to make music for a living, since quitting my day job in 1997. You have come to live shows. You have bought CDs and downloads. You have shared this music with your communities. You have posted and shared music, videos, tourdates and more on social media.
You are, quite literally, the solid frame of the vehicle I exist within, doodling around on the guitar and scratching lyrics into dime store notebooks. Even if you didn't know it. It's You. You. You. Thank you. 

Why Are We Here?
I made you something special: ""Plainfield,"" my best record to date. An intimate, stripped down, solo acoustic, live in the studio recording. With gratitude and humility, I ask you, esteemed patrons, to join me in co-creating, releasing and promoting ""Plainfield,"" helping it find a footing and new audiences further than previously possible. 
I've released seven albums (seven!) with virtually zero budget for serious promotion. Ugh! That's like starting a road trip with an empty tank of gas. In the desert. You're not going to get very far. This time, let's fill the tank and pack all the provisions! Hire a publicist, get a radio promoter on the horn (is that a thing?), sidle up to savvy social media captains, bestie a blogger, cruise a critic (wait, that came out wrong), and promote, promote, promote. I've thought up a long list of special perks and one of a kind incentives to add fun, flair and inspiration to the campaign. 

What Makes You So Special, Anyways?
Inspired by the likes of Audre Lorde, bell hooks, James Baldwin, Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Angela Davis and more, I embrace my identity, my duty, my innate responsibility, within the skin I'm in, to speak the truth as I see it. Tagging alongside a lineage of political artists, critical thinkers, and outspoken writers, tirelessly illuminating hidden power structures and institutions of oppression, whether visible, invisible, internal or external. And, although, it may be the road less commercially traveled (um, much less, much much less traveled), I remain committed to this path, this long road, this musical journey. And, it would not be possible, at all, if you weren't there to listen, groove, share, care.


Modern Day Movers and Shakers 

So, patrons of the ahhts, you happen to be the best record label around. A grass roots collection of like-minded individuals in common appreciation of, support for, and encouragement toward outspoken, uncensored art from independent artists who maintain complete control of their work.
This is what the modern music industry looks like. This is how it's done in the 21st century. Let's keep it goin'. Let's do 'dis. 



What Are You Gonna Do With All The Money?
Right
 off the top, before anybody gets anything, Indiegogo takes 5%, Paypal 
takes another 3 to 5%, and there is an additional 3%+$0.30 in processing
 fees for each credit card transaction. For every 10,000 raised, roughly
 3,000 will go toward fulfilling the rewards. The rest goes toward the 
costs of the project: paying for studio time and the recording engineer;
 musicians and producers (but, in this case, them is me), graphic 
designers, web designers, radio promoters, publicists, videographers, 
and promoting the videos online; plus, design and manufacturing of 
posters, promotional materials and merchandise. The more of a creative 
team's time, energy, and effort I can pay for, the further this record 
will go.
""Plainfield"" was, actually, already recorded this summer. It still needs final mixes and mastering. Studio fees have been accruing and still need to be paid. It will cost $8,000 to finish paying for the recording, artwork production and first pressing of CDs alone. The crucial focus of this campaign, hiring the bare minimum publicity team for radio and press, could easily cost $1500-$5000 or more, and in some cases per month! With $20,000 I can extend the publicity campaign, produce a video or two, and promote them online. $30,000 or more will allow me to push harder and even further with a longer PR campaign, and solidify tour support in key regions of the country that are wonderful but expensive to build upon. (West coast!) A stretch goal of $40,000 or more would allow me to tour more in regions where I rarely visit (Southeast, Southwest and the space between Austin and Seattle). And in some cases, I could afford to bring a band on the road! It would be such a thrill and a treat to take a band on the road, but they keep wanting money and food. Whatever. Currently, only the rare New England venue gets to see a full band show. The more we have to work with, the better the chances that this record will reach a wider audience than I have in the past. That's what you will be a part of: sharing this work that you've enjoyed for years out in the wide world. You will make this magic.

Other Ways to Help...Remember, a smile and a share go a long way. If you ain't got no money, honey, that's alright! Share this campaign, like a link, tweet a tweet, post a post. You never know how far it could go. Use these:#PamelaMeans#plainfieldthealbum

<h3>How did it start?</h3>
<p>Life has been quite a journey. After growing up, surrounded by the beautiful latvian country side, filled with wild days in the mesmerizing nature, I quickly realized, that everything I wish for in life is connected with music. A bunch of songs and music projects later, after having great times in Jazz and cover bands, I started to perform my own music. Played shows in bars, cafés and on folk festivals, and then eventually moved to Innsbruck. Here I work in a culture centre, where I organize concerts and open stage events for local musicians. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475710975/aeagxindnmakxatrrhw6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What is the project about?</h3>
<p>Through my work-related cultural network I met Christoph Holzknecht, with whom I started to perform in concerts and create a new program - mix from older songs and fresh material. So far we have played shows, festivals, parties and managed to create a sound that we both believe in. We still hold on to my simple and melancholic melodies (although Christoph did put some effort into changing my mind, but I am a stubborn lady). Mixing my songs with Christoph's electronic arrangements, beats and beautiful atmospheres, we managed to create our own little playground. And we would like to share it with you!</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZMcVEi_BMhY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Your investment in pre-ordering the material (and by doing so, also showing your trust in us) would mean the world to us. Everything that we put into the recording is hard work and love (and also some glasses of wine and sleepless nights) and we do hope (like all musicians do) that it brings joy to you as a listener.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Releasing music can been quite expensive. I have been saving money to pay all the wonderful people who have helped me so far and have showed trust in us even knowing my limited budget. All raised money is going to be invested into the production costs of our CD and Vinyl and therefore will be be completely bound to music (no, this really isn't a vacation fund).</p>
<p>In more details, your investment will help to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing and mastering of the album</li>
<li>Printing and packaging of CD's and Vinyl's</li>
<li>Costs for cover art</li>
<li>Costs for studio time</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the perk list and hopefully you can find something attractive for you! From simple and common perks as pre-ordering the CD or a vinyl and digital thank you, to special home gigs and home made poetry collections (believe me, you want to see this, I have always been a terrible visual artist, but I will try my best and put my heart in it). As most of my songs on the album have been inspired by the people surrounding me, you can also get your own special and unique song! I will write and release it especially for you (credits included)!</p>
<p>If we won't reach our goal of 2500 Euros, we still want to release the record. However, we would have to cut everything down to a minimum (and I will have to save money for another year to repay all the amazing people who have invested work in this project). </p>
<p>If we get a little extra money, we would invest it in the promotion, as this is an expensive and time consuming task.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that a lot of you out there have different priorities and we completely understand that. There are tons of people in need and as long as we all are aware of that and try to help each other, I feel blessed and happy!</p>
<p>However, there are still several ways how you can help us on our journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please spread a word about the campaign, show it to your friends, show it to your family! Maybe there is someone out there, who would be interested in supporting us.

<li>You can also give us a like on Facebook, as a lot of bookers check out the FB pages. This helps us to get gigs: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/baibadekenamusic/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/baibadekenamusic/?fref=ts</a>

<p><strong>Hello all,</strong></p>
<p>My name is Will. I am a musician and a DIY recording engineer obsessed with vintage recording gear. I love recording music as much as I love writing and playing it. My project is Skinshape - a sort of trip-hop/funky/souly/something-like-that project. It's ultimately a bedroom studio thing, and I started making Skinshape when I was a little-un at the age of 16. Nine years later, here I am still cooking tunes in the bedroom... I've put out two albums in the last two years, the first of which was self-titled (2014) and the other called 'Oracolo' (2015) - make sure to check them out!</p>
<p>The time has come for my third album to be released, it is about 90% done - and I am really really excited about getting the music out there for people to hear. If you've checked out the video; that song will be on the album too!</p>
<p><strong>The dilemma:</strong> recording and releasing an album tends to be quite an expensive process. With me it is no different! I have with me the music, recorded and very nearly finished. BUT I don't have the finances to make the last part of the process happen and make my dream a reality. </p>
<h3>All Money Raised Will Go To:</h3>
<p>* Mastering &amp; manufacture of the vinyl for the release (500 units).</p>
<p>* Getting the Musicians Paid - The album would not have been possible without these guys, they really really deserve it.</p>
<p>* Artwork Costs - although not finished yet, this artwork is going to be pretty special - and I wish to pay the artist as much as he deserves for his work!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>If You Aren't Able To Contribute...</h3>
<p>It's no big deal - I appreciate you checking out my project anyway - and hopefully you enjoyed the music. If you'd like to share it to anyone else that would also be fantastic!</p>
<p>Thanks Everyone.</p>

<h3><strong>About Me and My Campaign</strong></h3>
<p>Thank you for dropping by my campaign page! My name is Lisa Nicole. I call a small town in BC, Canada home, although I spend a lot of the time on the road performing across Canada and song-writing down South in Nashville.<br/><br/>I come from an authentic country upbringing and was heavily influenced by the sounds of Shania Twain, Martina McBride, and the Dixie Chicks. My own love of singing started at the age of 18 and by 15, I was playing regular jam sessions in Kootenay-area bars. I’ve never looked back.<br/><br/>After releasing my first EP in 2013 and touring across Canada, I won the BCCMA/Music BC Artist Development Project in 2015, which led to the 2016 release of my sophomore EP, Come Find Me, produced by Tom and Carly McKillip, and a national publicity and radio tour.<br/><br/>This year, I’ve released the title track from Come Find Me to radio, showcased at Canadian Music Week and even shared a duet on stage in Nashville with Keith Urban. With your help, I want to continue my career momentum by giving the single release of “Mad About It” the biggest combination of radio, publicity, and social media exposure to date. This campaign will bring more Canadian country music to more fans across the country and give them a song that is catchy and relates to them on a personal level.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am very fortunate to have received a grant from Creative BC to pay for 50% of my funding for this project. The remaining funding I need to execute this project is $6787. The funding I am asking for will cover the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filming a music video with Vancouver with director<strong> <a href=""http://www.platerovisual.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edward Platero</a> </strong>from Toronto. My photographer, <strong><a href=""http://www.erichsaide.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Erich Saide</a> </strong>will be present to capture single photos. Other costs for the video include lighting and equipment rentals, a hair and make-up person, a stylist, and location costs.</li>
<li>A radio and Spotify campaign by <strong><a href=""https://www.pitbullpromotions.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pitbull Promotions</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Publicity from <a href=""http://www.novacurrent.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Nova Current Creative Solutions </strong></a>to seek out PR outlets and set up interviews.</li>
<li>A social media campaign and single artwork graphics designed by <a href=""http://www.feistycreative.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Feisty Creative</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To give back to you for giving to me, I have set out some unique perks I am really excited about! I have exclusive photos from my Come Find Me photo shoot and fan packs. I am giving away my VERY first pair of cowboy boots I ever bought. A couple of my favorites are the Bootcamp with Lisa Nicole where I get to kick your butt! The “Day in the Kootenays” because I love and am proud of where I am from. It is the most beautiful place, summer or winter.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Influence</h3>
<p>Over the years of building my career, I have created a fan base that I am overly grateful for. I want to continue inviting new and old fans to appreciate my music. It’s an incredible feeling to have your songs touch other people in the way they did when you wrote it.  I love writing and performing relatable music. If I feel it, I’m sure someone else will.  I don’t sell party songs very well, I’m not the party hard every weekend beer sluggin’ type of girl. Although I do have friends that like to let lose and so I write about them.  This song represents a different side of me. The side that shows I am real and I can get angry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The music industry requires a lot of dedication and perseverance. Finance can always be a struggle for independent artists like myself. One needs to be well funded to keep up with the conventional standards. Criticism can be hard to deal with because not everyone will love you. The stress that often coincides with a rejection call or email can derail your motivation.<br/><br/>That said, I do persist and I have always been the type of artist to push forward and not focus on the negativity. It can be hard to ask for help, like I am now, but I have to put my pride on the table and just ask.  I have had many part time jobs to support my career and still do. Every penny I make goes directly to my music. I don’t own a house. I own a career. My ‘mortgage payment’ goes towards my career and that is a sacrifice I decided to make.  I have not drifted from my goals since I started pushing my career in 2012 and will persevere.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Can't donate? You can still help!</h3>
<p>If you can’t help monetarily, that is okay.  There are other ways! You can share this campaign by emailing it, txting it, shout it out to the world! You can also simply follow me on any of my social media channels @lisanicolemusic. <br/><br/>And please join my mailing list at <a href=""http://www.lisanicolemusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lisanicolemusic.com</a>. If Facebook ever disappears I need to make sure I have all my fans emails tucked away for safe keeping :) Much love and I thank you all kindly, xoxo<br/><br/>Lisa Nicole</p>

Over the years of building my career, I have created a fan base that I am overly grateful for. I want to continue inviting new and old fans to appreciate my music. It’s an incredible feeling to have your songs touch other people in the way they did when you wrote it.  I love writing and performing relatable music. If I feel it, I’m sure someone else will.  I don’t sell party songs very well, I’m not the party hard every weekend beer sluggin’ type of girl. Although I do have friends that like to let lose and so I write about them.  This song represents a different side of me. The side that shows I am real and I can get angry.

Risks & Challenges
The music industry requires a lot of dedication and perseverance. Finance can always be a struggle for independent artists like myself. One needs to be well funded to keep up with the conventional standards. Criticism can be hard to deal with because not everyone will love you. The stress that often coincides with a rejection call or email can derail your motivation.That said, I do persist and I have always been the type of artist to push forward and not focus on the negativity. It can be hard to ask for help, like I am now, but I have to put my pride on the table and just ask.  I have had many part time jobs to support my career and still do. Every penny I make goes directly to my music. I don’t own a house. I own a career. My ‘mortgage payment’ goes towards my career and that is a sacrifice I decided to make.  I have not drifted from my goals since I started pushing my career in 2012 and will persevere.

<h3>Short summary</h3>
<p>My ideas are not original, including vinyl-on-demand. What’s unique is my plan to offer high quality, low quantity vinyl records at an affordable price. With an anticipated cost of less than half of most vinyl cutting services it will be possible for musicians to sell records at a competitive price and still make a profit. For short runs lathe cutting is the best option around and I plan to make it even better by offering services at an unbeatable price.<br/> </p>
<h3>I heard lathe cutting is bad! </h3>
<p>The mono lathe cutters from the 1930s that many people use do sound bad! The system I will be is using is a contemporary German manufactured unit with full stereo and a dynamic range of 20 Khz. It’s a real time cutter and has a diamond stylus to insure the cleanest cut possible. Using high quality materials, the records stand up to many dozens of plays with little effect in quality. In fact you can hear an audio sample of the cutter <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dw6IVyc8djO5z2_cl1oBvar7uZbqoLnx/view"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. (Song: Move on - Josef Saddler).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is vinyl on demand?</h3>
<p>Vinyl on demand is an arrangement to make records only as they are sold. There are no up front costs for the artist, and therefore no risks and no unsold inventory. For the consumer it costs a little more than pressed records; but allows artists to offer their music in this great format.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to keep the expenses at a bare minimum without getting into DIY solutions. The setup requires a high quality record cutter and amplifier, professional turntable, specialized vacuum equipment, cutting stylus, supplies, etc. What you get is special pricing on top of an already amazing vinyl cutting deal, and the satisfaction that you are helping on demand records to be accessible to great new artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In supporting this project you do a couple of important things.<br/>First you will help launch and amazing new service, one that will help fill a void in the industry, quality affordable vinyl. Some of the most interesting music being made is by small bands and artists with limited resources and this is the best way to get their music on vinyl.<br/><br/>You also give a young and ambitious kid the resources to take the next steps in something I am really interested in. Many kids my age like music but I live for music; I have a FM pirate radio show, I make my own music and I have a record label that represents several talented artists. I do all of this because I enjoy it but I am also learning to run a business better at the same time.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are more challenges than risks in accomplishing the goals of this campaign if its funded. The biggest concern relates to the amount of time it may take to learn the system well enough to offer professional quality services, which is my top priority. Fortunately my budget includes in depth training on this particular cutter so I can learn every feature, and how to prevent most mistakes in operating the machine. I am also part of an active forum with many knowledgeable people and have the support of others who can help me when I can’t find it elsewhere.</p>
<h3>I want to contribute but I am nervous!</h3>
<p>I understand that I am asking for a lot of money, and you have may have questions. You may be wondering if I have the dedication to follow through with my plans or what will happen if I don't reach the target goal. </p>
<p>First let me assure you that this is not an idea I thought of last minute This is a project I have had in mind for almost a year and dedication to music production and promotion goes back several years. I have a weekly low power FM radio show and a record label with 5 signed artists from Europe. I have a home studio with lots of gear I have collected over the past few years and I make my own <a href=""https://www.audiotool.com/user/billhergonson"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">electronic music</a>. I know a ton about the genres of music that interest me and am a total nerd for technology and music. I couldn't be more motivated or dedicated to my music interests.

Muchas pruebas, obstáculos y situaciones familiares han prolongado el proceso de terminar el album. Pero gracias a Dios estamos en las etapas finales.

<p>After two years of intense touring and musical apprenticeship with some of the greats, <strong>Ryan McNally has got another album ready to press...and he needs your help to make it happen! </strong></p>
<p>A mix of originals and covers (including some of the earliest country-blues songs ever recorded!) the collection has a whole new sound inspired by everything from Calypso to old-time fiddle music. The 10 songs of Ryan's <i>third</i> full-length album will be recorded live off the floor at Bob Hamilton's renowned Old Crow recording studio in Whitehorse, Yukon. Along with a whole exciting line-up of instruments (tuba, baritone sax, drum,harmonica...) and Ryan's regular foot-tapping good guitar licks,  this will also be the first album on which he'll be presenting his recently acquired fiddle skills!  </p>
<p><strong>If you know Ryan's music then you probably just want to skip straight to the Perks section and support the project! Otherwise, read on...</strong></p>
<h3>You Don't Know Ryan McNally???</h3>
<p>Quebec native and Yukoner these last 10 years,  Ryan McNally has been performing both originals and covers on stages across Canada, the U.S. and China for over 15 years. </p>
<p>From apprenticeships in old blues song and history with Andy Cohen in Memphis, to rockabilly and jazz solo guitar with Paul Pigat in Vancouver; to studying fiddle with Sammy Lind and jazz-blues aficionado Aaron Gunn in New Orleans Ryan never ceases to push beyond his own limits and sharpen his musical chops. </p>
<p>With this new album he plans to do just that by exploring new band arrangements,  different guitar styles and connecting the dots between the old blues and Calypso that he's been immersed in through his travels to New Orleans, Memphis and elsewhere. </p>
<p>The musicians who'll be recording on the album are all incredibly talented; Marc Lindy on tuba ; Olivier de Colombel on baritone sax and Patrick Hamilton on bass drum and vocals.Two out of three have been accompanying Ryan in his live performances for quite a while and the easy cohesion of bandmates is apparent in their live and recorded material. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In reality, the album will end up costing a minimum of $15,000. We're asking for $7,000 because that will cover the majority of urgent costs and will make for a true collaboration on all fronts between you, the project supporters, and Ryan. </p>
<p>Funds will go towards all aspects of the production, from hiring musicians and paying for the studio and technician, to mixing and mastering the album, to printing cds (and vinyls if we make it to our full goal!)...and hey, maybe even some promotion of the album if we pass our goal a bit so more people can hear this awesome music!</p>
<p>We've decided to opt for Flexible Funding, which means that even if for some reason we <i>don't</i> reach the full amount your contribution will still be able to go towards completing the project! </p>
<p><strong>PERKS</strong></p>
<p>Perks are what you get in gratitude for your support of the album project!</p>
<p>You can get full details on each perk by clicking on them in the right hand column where they're all listed, but here are the basic details...</p>
<p>For a $ 20 contribution you get a digital album &amp; personal thank you note </p>
<p>$ 35 = a signed copy of physical album </p>
<p>$75 = a vinyl of the new album (***note that this perk will only be available IF we reach our full goal!)</p>
<p>$100 = a private guitar lesson with Ryan McNally (in person if in Whitehorse or at a tour location, or via skype)</p>
<p>$200 = full anthology of Ryan McNally's cds, plus a signed poster and t-shirt</p>
<p>$500 = a song written for you by Ryan!</p>
<p>$ 700 = Ryan will be your personal chauffeur for a day in his classic 1965 F100 Ford pickup (***limited to Whitehorse residents)</p>
<p>$1000 = a house concert in the Yukon </p>
<p>$2000 = a house concert anywhere in Canada!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>ALBUM RELEASE GOAL: Fall 2018 </h3>
<p>Our goal is to send out all the perks by late fall or early winter 2018!</p>
<p>**Please note that for house concerts we'll need to be in touch about booking a date and we're aiming to have them all scheduled for winter 2018 or spring 2019.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're deeply grateful for any amount you can contribute to help this album get off the ground! We also totally understand that not everyone will be able to support the project financially, so...</p>
<p>If you're not able to support the campaign financially at this time (or even if you are) it would be GREAT if you would share the campaign around with your networks...(P.S. A little tip: it always helps a lot if you write something recommending the campaign in your post instead of just sharing the link, though either way we'll appreciate it :)). </p>

<p><strong>In today's modern music industry we see less bands pounding the pavement touring and more internet related means of making an income.

<p><strong>Uncle Sid stays true to the roots of rock and roll, we have our own little modern nuances up the ol sleeve, and we have also been on the road several times, mostly out of our own pocket. However, for this tour we will be traveling to distant lands in a galaxy far far away and some with haunted Castles (actually it's in the UK , but still farrrr!!!) and with your help we will also become a touring juggernaut just as our forefathers in Rock'n Metal once were and still are.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Just recently on April 28th, 2018 Uncle Sid was very fortunate to be given the opportunity to support one of Britain's finest acts : URIAH HEEP and with our UK tour just around the corner we may have another opportunity to share the stage with them again, with your help Uncle Sid will be able to keep the touring roots of rock alive and hopefully inspire others to take the torch and pass it on as well.</strong></p>

<p>The cost of an event like the Riverview Jazz Festival runs well over $70,000.

We are seeking $10,000 to help us subsidize the cost of the musicians' fees. This will enable us to pay the performers more generously so that they can generously give you more of what you've come to expect from them and us. It's also important to us that we keep the festival free to the public, and by helping directly support the musicians, you will become an integral instrument in helping us fulfill our mission of bringing jazz to the people.</p>

<p>Hello! I'm Magenta - a singer-songwriter, choir leader and singing teacher based in London. I've been writing songs since my early teens and I am finally self-releasing my debut single - <i>Circles</i> - on June 8th. This is a real passion project and an incredibly exciting step - I can't wait to share my music with you all. I'm at the start of my promotional campaign and i've already been picked up by BBC Introducing East Midlands and <i>Circles</i> is Song of the Week. </p>
<p>So, why do I need your help? I am looking for your support in helping me to continue my musical journey, releasing a four track EP and creating more music. Producing music is extraordinarily expensive - my single cost in the region of £500 to record, and that involved a lot of mates rates along the way (I am hugely grateful). I would love to release my EP in late 2018 but to do this I need your backing to cover session musicians, a producer, recording vocals, mixing and mastering as well as a promotional campaign. All of these elements are essential for my music to reach you. </p>
<p>During my career I have worked with jazz star Wynton Marsalis, Disney, trance DJs Genix and Solarstone, as well as singing lead vocals for leading major dance labels. Most recently I have been writing with songwriting veteran Michael Garvin (23 #1s including Jennifer Lopez’ Waiting for Tonight and George Benson’s Never Give Up on a Good Thing) and I am currently writing with the DWB production team. Alongside songwriting, I conduct choirs and appeared on The One Show in 2015 when I was named BBC ‘Unsung Hero’ for my work with community music. In 2017 I had the opportunity to work with Gary Barlow on his West End musical GIRLS. I led two mass choirs assembled to perform with Barlow at the Royal Variety Show and the Olivier Awards and also recorded a track with him that I later performed with the cast of GIRLS on the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing. My music is influenced by artists such as Joni Mitchell, Carol King and the Cardigans. </p>
<p>Within this site there are various offers - everything from receiving a signed copy of my single to a bespoke lullaby written especially for a little one in your life, written and recorded by my wonderful musician friends Karen and Mike Eaves. </p>
<p>If you are unable to support me financially I am still incredibly grateful for your help - please share my music on social media or this campaign using the Indiegogo share button.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Thank you so much, as always, for your support - I truly truly appreciate it. </p>

<h3>THIS IS ME</h3>
<p>Daniele was born in Rome on February 10th 1992. </p>
<p>He has been singing since the age of 10 and over time, what seemed like a simple passion, has become a true profession. In the his early years as a singer, Daniele perfected the Voicecraft Method thanks to Gabriella Scalise and continued his studies abroad while attending various Singing/Performing Arts academies. Among the most important are the MALTA ACADEMY OF PERFORMING ARTS (Malta) , WEST FINLAND COLLEGE (Finland) SETH RIGGS ACADEMY (Los Angeles), where he studied SLS - Speech Level Singing. </p>
<p>At the age of 16 he was chosen as the protagonist of the first season of the tv show “Ti lascio Una Canzone,” broadcasted live on RaiUno by the Ariston Theater. </p>
<p>A turning point in Daniele’s career came in 2012 as a semi-finalist on the TV show ""The X FACTOR”.  On November 29, 2012, during the semifinal of the show, he presented his first original song “UN GIORNO IN PIU,’” written especially for him by American songwriter Gavin De Graw. </p>
<p>On April 18 2014, iTunes and all digital stores released his second single ""ORA CHE SEI GRANDE”</p>
<p>In January 13 2018, ITunes and all digital stores released his third single “GAME ON”. The song represents the Daniele’s true artistic soul: an international sound that unites pop and rock.</p>
<p>The song has been broadcast on various Radio Stations throughout The United States and won an award as ""BEST VIDEO POP OF THE MONTH"" .</p>

<h3><strong>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP</strong></h3>
<p>This project will be impossible without your contribution to help me cover the costs associated with producing a CD and the Official Videoclips. I have set my funding goal at 15,000 Euros in order to help us cover these aspects of the project: </p>
<p>- Writing Sessions with the best songwriters</p>
<p>- Production of tracks, which will be new and original arrangements.</p>
<p>- Recording of live musicians to offer the best quality of sound possible</p>
<p>- Vocal recording studio sessions and final mixing and editing by professional sound engineers</p>
<p>- Album art and design and production</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3><strong>CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR BENEFITS</strong></h3>
<p>Music is my life and i can't live without it. Nowadays major recording labels sponsor and help only a few artists and most of the contracts they offer are ridiculously binding, That's why i need to do it by myself. I hope that if you have ever enjoyed one of my performances, live or on TV, you will consider donating.</p>
<p>THANK YOU VERY MUCH. </p>

This project will be impossible without your contribution to help me cover the costs associated with producing a CD and the Official Videoclips. I have set my funding goal at 15,000 Euros in order to help us cover these aspects of the project: 
- Writing Sessions with the best songwriters
- Production of tracks, which will be new and original arrangements.
- Recording of live musicians to offer the best quality of sound possible
- Vocal recording studio sessions and final mixing and editing by professional sound engineers
- Album art and design and production
 
CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR BENEFITS
Music is my life and i can't live without it. Nowadays major recording labels sponsor and help only a few artists and most of the contracts they offer are ridiculously binding, That's why i need to do it by myself. I hope that if you have ever enjoyed one of my performances, live or on TV, you will consider donating.

<p>Lumina is a professional women’s ensemble dedicated to the mystery, beauty, and hope inherent in music. Based in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, Lumina has collaborated with faith communities, schools, and choral organizations to present concerts, special church services, and educational workshops. Our programming draws from a rich and diverse well of musical sources, including Medieval chants, Renaissance motets, and folk song traditions, as well as works by living and local composers. Our goal is to share the spiritual experience of music through performance, participation, and education.</p>
<p>Lumina has been singing together for four years, and we focus on music with hope, healing, and light. We've had fun singing together and for our wonderful audiences, many of whom have asked about a recording—so, we're about to answer that request and further our mission to adding a little light and compassion in the world!</p>
<p>In this campaign, <strong>we are looking to fund a recording to give away to individuals in hospice care, their families, and care partners</strong> as they look to music as a source of healing and hope.</p>
<p>Any amount will help defray printing cost of rehearsal, recording, studio time, and printing. The American Composers Forum (ACF) has generously agreed to be our fiscal sponsor for this project in order to make your contributions tax-deductible.</p>
<p>You, of course, can help us fund this and receive all the tracks! We would ideally need $10,000 to get us to that first printing of 1000 CDs for distribution to hospitals and hospice organizations. You can contribute $25 or higher to receive your own digital copies of the tracks, and many rewards also include Lumina swag or appearances WITH the ladies of Lumina. <strong>Any additional funds raised over our campaign minimum will be used to print more CDs to give away</strong>. Not for sale! </p>
<p>Our rewards are just like us: UNIQUE. Do you want to sit in on the recording experience and hear the bloopers in real time? Would you dare to have coffee with Lumina for an hour?! All these rewards go toward helping comfort patients and their family and friends!</p>
<p><strong>Specifically, do you have an event (a party, a BBQ, etc.) on Saturday, May 26th? Lumina will come to you!</strong></p>
<p>We're hitting the road in an RV to come to sing for you! May 26th, we'll be able to pop by your celebrations to offer you all the perks of being a supporter, plus 15 minutes of music to entertain your guests. We know: How do you even begin to plan your day a month away? Let us help you! Find some friends, find some food, relax into the lovely Saturday that we know it will be, and let us serenade you! Your schedule will have to be a bit flexible, but we will be in contact with you to schedule our trip so it's convenient for you and efficient for us. We can only stay in the metro area, but perhaps if you live outside, consider sending a surprise singing telegram to someone you know (or don't know?)! As a Firework Supporter, you also get an exclusive access to a secret perk, to be redeemed at your event!</p>
<p>With your help, we can provide this free access to music—we will not sell these tracks once they are recorded! <strong>Our campaign ensures a grassroots movement of compassion and love, and we are so grateful to share this with our community of healers.</strong></p>
<p>If a financial gift isn't in your budget, please consider sharing this with your friends on social media, members of your choirs, and most of all, reach out to us so we know you're just as excited about this as we are!</p>

<h3>About This Campaign</h3>
<p>We are a band of guys who share a lot of life together.  We began the project of what is now Shiny Penny in the heart of Kokomo, IN years ago.</p>
<p>We enjoy nature adventures, long boarding, playful experiences with yorkies, and really good pizza (amongst other things).</p>
<p>We also like community a lot. As a result of the music we've written and the shows we've performed throughout our journey, we've been able to be in community with so many of you (and it's beautiful). </p>
<p>Through the years, we've experienced ups and downs along the way. We've worked hard, played hard, and invested much into what we do. With all of this, we've also grown. Through our growth, we've recognized a desire to do more with Shiny Penny than we ever have before.</p>
<p>We started this campaign because we have new music to make and to share with you, and though we have big ideas for the band's future, we simply don't have the means to do it all on our own. </p>
<p>We've created what we believe is our best music to date, and we're passionate about the message and story it brings to the table. We also have new ideas to enhance our shows and the overall experience that we believe will bring us closer together with you all.</p>
<p>Our dream is take Shiny Penny to the next level on all fronts, and with your help, we believe we will get there soon.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise $25,000. All of the money received will go towards the many aspects of what we plan to achieve with the future of Shiny Penny, including:</p>
<div><ul>
<li>Fresh, high quality recordings of our new music </li>
<li>Purchasing a new, reliable vehicle and trailer for our travels</li>
<li>Music videos</li>
<li>Stage production (sound, lights, props, etc)</li>
<li>Camera gear and computers to help us provide more higher quality video content to you on a regular basis</li>
<li>Fresh, official Shiny Penny merchandise</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul></div>

<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Is Important</h3>
<p>Though we're just a small part of a really big world, we recognize that extraordinary things usually come from the seemingly ordinary. We've been given gifts to write, share, and perform music, and we believe that God is calling us to share these gifts with as many of you who will listen. We seek to inspire, encourage, and help our fellow humans in any way we can, and this music gives us an avenue to do it.</p>

While we realize the challenges ahead of us, we think that by participating in competitions, festivals, and young artists schemes, we will be able to make our ensemble a sustainable and long term project. <br/><br/>We've been very working hard and doing whatever we can to create opportunities for ourselves.<br/>We had a small, self organized tour of central Italy, during which:</p><ul>
<li>we competed in the Maurizio Pratola International Music Competition in L'Aquila and were awarded first place,</li>
<li>we performed concerts in L'Aquila, Roccantica, Forano, and Montebuono.</li>
</ul><p>In August, we've been invited to perform fringe concerts at the MA Festival in Bruges and Utrecht Oude Muziek, two of the world's most important early music festivals:</p><ul>

<li>August 27, 15:30 - Polman's Huis, Utrecht, Netherlands</li>

We became ensconced in the process with Nik, recording at <b>Andrew McPherson's (Eccodek) Monastereo Studio</b> in Guelph, Ontario, Canada.

What you get is to follow our journey with this record, with regular updates, daily interaction if you want and special messages only pledgers will receive. Plus of course you get the pledge you choose.<br/></p><div>
</div><ul> </ul><div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your help will get this album completed and into the hands of not only <b>fans of Celtic and World Music worldwide, but taste-makers, radio stations, the music press, record companies, booking agents and venues</b>! Like our last campaign where we raised over $6,600 to showcase at the world's largest International Folk Conference in Kansas City in front of hundreds of industry professionals from all over the world, we need to plant even more seeds now. <b>Thanks to everyone who donated to that, our very successful first campaign. Now we need your help to get this record to the next level and through the next several phases.</b><br/></p>
<p>So, here we go again....ready to jump on board?<br/></p>
<p>There are a lot of folks we need to send this record to around the world who we met in Kansas City. <b>This is really the followup of what we did in Kansas City.</b> We can't wait to hear what you and they have to say about this record and what can come from this push into new territories.<br/></p>
<p><b>Phase One</b> - raise ~$3000 to release the record (Mastering, Artwork, Manufacturing) will press an initial 1,000 units.<br/></p>
<p><b>Phase Two</b> - raise ~$1500 minimum to create a professional video to promote everywhere</p>
<p><b>Phase Three</b> - raise ~$1500 to promote in Canada (publicist, materials and postage to radio, press, taste-makers and web-blogs)<br/></p>
<p><b>Phase Three</b> - raise ~$6,000+++ to promote to several territories including USA, Europe, Australia and elsewhere (limited only by the budget available and this will determine numbers, length and scope). The more we raise, the more we promote. There is no limit really, but $6,000 covers an initial campaign into the US (500+) and about 50 packages targeted around the world.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are no risks. The record is done and we will manufacture it and send it out. But without the budget above, it will limit what we will be able to do. Ideally, the band would like to be able to follow all of the steps of the release, especially the aspect of promotion here in Canada and globally. The more funds that are raised, the more we can move forward to promote 'Latitude' around the world. </p>
</div> <div> </div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><div> </div><p>We realize that not everyone can help financially. If you would like to help in some other way, the band will need folks to assist with the mail-outs (locally), postering (wherever we are playing), or even <b>simply sharing the campaign with your friends! </b>Please talk to any of the band if you can help! Share, share and share some more. As much as you can! It will help more than you might think. Let's start a tweet trend! Haha! Thanks for any way you can assist. It is very much appreciated!

Your help will get this album completed and into the hands of not only fans of Celtic and World Music worldwide, but taste-makers, radio stations, the music press, record companies, booking agents and venues! Like our last campaign where we raised over $6,600 to showcase at the world's largest International Folk Conference in Kansas City in front of hundreds of industry professionals from all over the world, we need to plant even more seeds now. Thanks to everyone who donated to that, our very successful first campaign. Now we need your help to get this record to the next level and through the next several phases.
So, here we go again....ready to jump on board?
There are a lot of folks we need to send this record to around the world who we met in Kansas City. This is really the followup of what we did in Kansas City. We can't wait to hear what you and they have to say about this record and what can come from this push into new territories.
Phase One - raise ~$3000 to release the record (Mastering, Artwork, Manufacturing) will press an initial 1,000 units.
Phase Two - raise ~$1500 minimum to create a professional video to promote everywhere
Phase Three - raise ~$1500 to promote in Canada (publicist, materials and postage to radio, press, taste-makers and web-blogs)
Phase Three - raise ~$6,000+++ to promote to several territories including USA, Europe, Australia and elsewhere (limited only by the budget available and this will determine numbers, length and scope). The more we raise, the more we promote. There is no limit really, but $6,000 covers an initial campaign into the US (500+) and about 50 packages targeted around the world.
  Risks & Challenges There are no risks. The record is done and we will manufacture it and send it out. But without the budget above, it will limit what we will be able to do. Ideally, the band would like to be able to follow all of the steps of the release, especially the aspect of promotion here in Canada and globally. The more funds that are raised, the more we can move forward to promote 'Latitude' around the world. 
  Other Ways You Can Help We realize that not everyone can help financially. If you would like to help in some other way, the band will need folks to assist with the mail-outs (locally), postering (wherever we are playing), or even simply sharing the campaign with your friends! Please talk to any of the band if you can help! Share, share and share some more. As much as you can! It will help more than you might think. Let's start a tweet trend! Haha! Thanks for any way you can assist. It is very much appreciated! Lindsay, Glen & Barry",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</h3><p>Hi everybody! </p><p>My name

player and musical director for the legendary Joe Strummer. Oh I know. Kevin the
nerd in Repo Man. Well, I've done a lot of things in this long life of mine but
the one thing that I've never done and always wanted to do is make a solo
album. And so it begins with a five song EP. Don't get me wrong, I got 50 more
where these came from. You see, I don't have a choice in the matter. I was put
on this great earth to make music. But at this point in history, us musicians
need a little help from the people. The giant dinosaur that is the music
industry has closed the castle doors and only mousketeers can dwell within its
walls. That's good news because now us old veterans and craftsman don't need
the shitty committee to approve our content, age, game plan, etc. It's in our

songs to you the people. My music is heartfelt. I'm on a mission to make the
world a less shitty place one song at a time. This is just the beginning. </p>

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
</div>
<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my Indiegogo campaign. My name is Steve
Fulton (Boise, Idaho). I create, live and breath music. I’ve
always been moved by music-
even
when I was a child, and as I've grown music has become my
solace, my passion and my lifelong career. </p>
<p>I have been a record
producer/engineer and recording studio owner (Audio Lab) for over 24
years. I’ve been in countless bands, released many records,
performed hundreds of live concerts, produced music-oriented events
around the nation, sat in as a session musician for countless numbers
of bands, and have stories from the road that have molded me into who
I am today.</p>
<p>
I
am hoping that sharing my songs can provide this place of solace for
others.</p>

</ul></div>
<div><b>What if we don’t reach our goal?  </b></div>

What We Need and What You Get


Up to now our festival has been a labour of love. This year we are working hard to be able to offer all collaborators and participating artists a small recompense for their time and work. 

By next year we could be almost entirely covered by sponsorship and ticket sales, but this year we need your help to cover the expenses involved in the organisation of a festival, such as: 


Marketing & Communication (promotional material, print costs, web...)


Logistics & Production (stands, market, transportation...)
Infrastructure (outdoor bathrooms, generator...)
Program coordination (DJ's, performing artists, workshop hosts...)
Permits, taxes, insurance, etc...

What if we don’t reach our goal?  
We won't be able to include some aspects in this year's festival but hey, the show must go on! Every cent raised here will go toward staging the best festival we can.

THE PERKS! Buy your tickets now and get a great deal on the price and additional crowdfunding extras. We've also included other ways for our supporters to help us MAKE the festival even if they can't join us this year.

////////Risks and Challenges




Budgeting: The 20,000€ financial goal of this crowdfunding campaign covers 1/3 of what we need. Combined with additional ticket sales it will make up 2/3 of our total 2016 income. Having this money in advance will allow us to make all the festival improvements a reality this year.


Sponsors: As a startup we don't have established sponsors yet - we're completely self-funded. We're attracting growing sponsor interest and estimate that sponsorship will cover the remaining 1/3 of this year's expenses. By promoting our music festival on wheels, we're extending the appeal to other target markets and  potential sponsors.

A lot to do: Insurance, liability cover for attendees, city council meetings and permits in two cities, booths, outdoor bathrooms, power, music systems, taxes, ticket promotion, communication... there is a lot for us to do to get all the moving parts working together for a successful festival. 


Infrastructure: As we are outdoors by the beach, we have to create the entire infrastructure from scratch. This year we want to include a skate park area right there to have all the workshops in one place.


Better ticketing controls: This year we are using a new platform with better secure payment options and improved customer experience. One of the best ways you can support us is by attending and experiencing it for yourself!


Biggest challenge: to be able to enjoy the festival ourselves! We would LOVE to be able to enjoy the festival dancing with you! If we have resources in advance, we can do just that. Thank you!

Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't help us out financially, please help sharing our campaign through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media platforms to spread the love!

If you are part of the roller skate community you can also help us by putting word out locally to skaters of all stripes, and help us share this experience with more and more skaters.

The impact of this event on peoples lives and the quality of the attending DJ's, musicians, artists and athletes, positions our festival as a benchmark for skating events.
We are the world's premier skate music festival and we hope to count on your support!
THANK YOU ♡


Together we can make our dreams come true! ♡

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Great Poet. Great Composer. </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Great Project. </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a soprano working in the music field since twenty years. I am dedicated mostly at the XX and XXI Centuries repertoire. During the last years I recorded for iTinerant the new works <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/quintanar-piano-concerto-heras-divertimento-lavista/id1193776250"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cantata Concertante N.3 <i>Phos Hilaron </i>(Joyful Light) </a> and <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/juan-trigos-symphony-no-4-nezahualc%C3%B3yotl-icuicahuan/id1177948697"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Symphony N.4 <i>Nezahualcoyotl Icuicahuan </i>(Chants of Nezahualcoyotl)</a> by Mexican-American composer Juan Trigos. I have been invited at Eastman School of Music (Rochester, NY) to premier his most recent new work the String Quartet II, for soprano and string quartet in April 2017. In May of the same year, I will fly to Mexico to record one of his operas <i>Historia de Cabeza</i> (<i>Head's History</i>).</p>
<p><strong>With your help, in 2015 I have been able to produce Juan Trigos' opera DeCachetitoRaspado in Atlanta receiving a mention as one of the five most important new productions in the Atlanta's music scene 2015. </strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Now you have the opportunity to be part of another great, amazing, project! Commission Juan Trigos a new song cycle with texts by Ezra Pound to the renowned Mexican-American composer and realize the world premier recording of this new work for iTinerant. This CD is truly important for my career in this moment because it is my first CD completely produced by myself.</strong></p>
<p>Juan Trigos is one of the greatest living composer, especially for voice. His music is alive and original. In it, every note is part of a perfect structure without loosing the depth of the emotions. His vocal works' catalogue includes works for solo and ensemble, three Cantatas and a Mass for solos and chorus with ensamble and/or orchestra, five operas and a symphony with voice. Is missing just a song cycle for voice and piano!!! </p>

We have raised 20% of our goal of $15,000 needed to pay the expenses related to this awesome opportunity. Our hard work, talent, show and songs got us the gig. No buy-ons. no politics.

We traveled all over the states, and made many new fans and friends. We have also become friends with Adam Ant's band: Joe, Will, Jola and Andy, as well as the management and crew. We can't wait to see them all again. Adam was super nice to us, and we are so proud to perform on the same stage as an artist of his rock-star stature.</p>
<p>Now for the first time, (and thanks to Adam Ant) Glam Skanks have the opportunity to take our show to an international audience, take our careers to a new level, and our music to the other side of the pond.

<p>Previous ""Songs from the Bishop"" events have been run with token payments to performers, borrowed equipment, and time hacked out of already overloaded schedules. But the first place your funding will go to is increasing the amounts we can afford to pay performers and add more more performers if possible.

<p>All funding will be used to fund the 2017 Songs from the Bishop event and any remaining funds will be held in trust at the Stinson Community Association for the 2018 Songs from the Bishop.</p>
<p>We're asking you to help keep Songs going.  Keep our children dancing, and our friends and neighbors having a great way to enjoy a summer evening in the park together. It's one of the Community Association/Planning Team's primary events, and hopefully this year, we can strengthen our outreach to residents in our divided community.</p>
<p>For the many of the residents of our neighbourhood, this is the only time they see live music, and we frequently have folks dancing with walkers or children in the square!</p>

<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>Music was always playing a big part in my life, in many different forms, shapes and sounds. With a background in western classical music, singing in children's choir and then studying at the Music Academy in Tel Aviv, but also with a big love to Rock music from the 70's, and then studying classical Indian music in India and around, one day I found myself in a different and wonderful space. This was the space of the sacred sounds played in a Kundalini Yoga class I went to for the first time. This powerful practice immediately got my attention and supported me in times of transition.</p>
<p>I continued to practice with devotion and started to go deeper and deeper into the sacred sounds,  discovering a creative material within myself that I wasn't aware of before. It was truly liberating. So I've continued to explore and experiment more, composing the Mantras, the sacred and elevating words of the Guru's and Masters.  </p>
<p>The music in this project can be used in your Yoga class, in your own personal practice and even just listening in the car or at work. This project is made to elevate and support your spiritual journey as well as your human experience and everyday life.</p>

<p>Mantras are combinations of words that were spoken by spiritual teachers and masters in higher states of consciousness. The purpose of repeating and chanting the mantras is to clear the subconscious and plant new seeds of consciousness.</p>
<p>There are mantras for every mood or need, like mantra for protection, for courage, healing, abundance, mental balance and more.</p>
<p>This is an ancient technology you can find in any spiritual tradition, and it doesn't have to come with a religious connection.  Everyone can chant and you don't need to have a musical background. </p>

I spent a lot of my time fusing together different types of music. My experiments wound up getting the title ""Grunge Jazz"" I have experimented into other genres from time to time but when push comes to shove Grunge and Jazz are the two places where I wander back to relearn things. <br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This campaign will accomplish 4 things for me. <br/></p>
<p>1)  An awesome print of a CD of my new EP ""Ugly"".</p>
<p>2) Will give this project a fighting chance  to  being promoted the best it can with ads on social media and other kinds of press. <br/></p>
<p>3) Print stickers to put up next to your ex-girlfriend or boyfriends phone numbers in every bar and McDonald's in the San Francisco Bay Area.  <br/></p>
<p>4) Get me back into the recording studio to redo some of the songs. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The big help I will get with this campaign is advertising. I have enjoyed a decent amount of success running ads on a small scale. In the process I have made new friends. This campaign will help cultivate fans.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I need $5,000 for duplication and promotion of the EP. Around $1000 will go to duplication and the rest will go to promoting (Print, social media) and promotional materials (Stickers, T-Shirts).<br/></p> <ul><li>Perks for this campaign will include:<br/>A children's album that I recorded for my daughter; a copy of my older critically acclaimed album ""Random Acts Of Grunge Jazz""  with some bad ass cameo's from Curtis Ohlson (Ray Charles, George Duke, Bob Weir, Pete Escovedo)Brian Collier (Lauryn Hill, Santana, Freddy Clarke) and Mick Mestek (Tower Of Power) <br/>
</li></ul>
<ul> <li>If I  don't reach my goal on Indiegogo I will use what money I do raise to get promotional materials. <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>I have been working at making my niche in music for a half my life now. Thanks to the internet and a bunch of trial and error I have found a way  of getting outstanding results in exposure. My career could make a nice size leap with the right kind of funding.This campaign is a great opportunity to see what works  for other indie musicians.  <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges <br/>
</h3>some say the music industry is almost non existent. I don't believe that. With the computer age mutating into a information monster it's not a choice of throwing in the towel but finding ways to get this monster to sit and fetch a ball for us.

</li> </ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short SummaryMy name is Mike Glendinning and I am a songwriter from the San Francisco Bay Area. I spent a lot of my time fusing together different types of music. My experiments wound up getting the title ""Grunge Jazz"" I have experimented into other genres from time to time but when push comes to shove Grunge and Jazz are the two places where I wander back to relearn things. 

This campaign will accomplish 4 things for me. 
1)  An awesome print of a CD of my new EP ""Ugly"".
2) Will give this project a fighting chance  to  being promoted the best it can with ads on social media and other kinds of press. 
3) Print stickers to put up next to your ex-girlfriend or boyfriends phone numbers in every bar and McDonald's in the San Francisco Bay Area.  
4) Get me back into the recording studio to redo some of the songs. 

The big help I will get with this campaign is advertising. I have enjoyed a decent amount of success running ads on a small scale. In the process I have made new friends. This campaign will help cultivate fans.  

  What I Need & What You Get I need $5,000 for duplication and promotion of the EP. Around $1000 will go to duplication and the rest will go to promoting (Print, social media) and promotional materials (Stickers, T-Shirts). Perks for this campaign will include:A children's album that I recorded for my daughter; a copy of my older critically acclaimed album ""Random Acts Of Grunge Jazz""  with some bad ass cameo's from Curtis Ohlson (Ray Charles, George Duke, Bob Weir, Pete Escovedo)Brian Collier (Lauryn Hill, Santana, Freddy Clarke) and Mick Mestek (Tower Of Power) 

 If I  don't reach my goal on Indiegogo I will use what money I do raise to get promotional materials. 
    The Impact  I have been working at making my niche in music for a half my life now. Thanks to the internet and a bunch of trial and error I have found a way  of getting outstanding results in exposure. My career could make a nice size leap with the right kind of funding.This campaign is a great opportunity to see what works  for other indie musicians.  
    Risks & Challenges 
some say the music industry is almost non existent. I don't believe that. With the computer age mutating into a information monster it's not a choice of throwing in the towel but finding ways to get this monster to sit and fetch a ball for us. As for risks, well, I guess this is the really good news because if you think about it with the right decisions things ave very possible. 
  Other Ways You Can Help If you just can't contribute, you can still help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign. Please use Indiegogo share tools!
Tell your friends about my work and join me on the social media sites I hang out on and use to get to know people who like my music. 
   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>More About This Project</h3>
<p>Cindy McElroy grew her musical roots on Drummond Island in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.The singer/songwriter draws from her life experiences and travels around the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe. Inspired by icons James Taylor, Carole King, The Beatles, Elvis Costello, and Eva Cassidy her music takes on an acoustic flavor. With the recent additions of Guiseppe Stella (Jerry Lee Lewis, Bobby Gentry, Stax Records) as producer and drummer, Jon Herrmann (Steppin' In It, The Lash, Larry McCray) as engineer and bassist, Ron Bretz on guitar, Michael Mleczko on keys, and many other gifted musicians involved, the current project, ""Word Might Get Around"", has flourished. Cindy feels they hear her music the same as she does and the sound is fantastic.</p>
<p>The loss of her grandmother in 1987 and her mother in 2006 to Alzheimer's Disease turned her musical focus to the disease. ""The Queen of Norway"", co-written by friend and author, Rich Hill (A Deckhands Tale), focuses on Cindy's personal experiences related to Alzheimer's. Any funds received above the goal of this campaign will be donated to the Alzheimer's Association. Here is a blog written by Cindy in 2012 about the disease. <a href=""https://cindymcelroy.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/alzheimersfeel-the-love/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://cindymcelroy.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/a...</a></p>
<p>Cindy is involved in the music scene in Lansing Michigan and feels she owes much to her friends and family who have been supportive over the years. Ultimately, she views the successful completion of this E.P. as instrumental in her desire to give back to those who have helped in her journey.</p>
<p>In order to continue moving forward with the recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, duplication, licensing, and general administrative costs, we need to raise some money. Your help in this regard will allow us to finish this project while maintaining a high quality in recording production.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need to pay the following musicians and engineers...</p>
<p>Jon Herrmann (engineer/co-producer/bassist); Guiseppe Stella (producer/drummer); Glenn Brown (mastering engineer); Michael Mleczko (keyboardist); Ron Bretz (guitarist); Jon Gewirtz (saxophone); Shawn Bell (trombone); Micah Ling (cello); and a vocal choir on ""Sweep Me Away"".</p>
<p>We also need to pay for the use of Troubador Recording Studio, Epiphany Recording Studio, artwork and layout for the CD's, and duplication. Here's a more detailed breakdown...</p>

<p>       aka Pierre Tran. I've had a fascination with creating for as long as I can remember.

<p>         For the last few years, I have gone through many serious life changes. Through these changes , I am grateful to be alive and that I still have what I have left.

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     With your support, I'm able to live out my dream &amp; passion. Making art means the world to me, and anyone who's ever met me knows how important it really is. By funding this current project, I'm able to gather more resources to produce as much quality work as I can. I hope my passion will resonate with you, and inspire you in any way possible. I write, compose, produce and play every instrument on this record.</p>
<p>The 5-songs are currently in demo form, and this is where the funding is going.</p>
<ul>
<li>$1500 - Mixing</li>
<li>$500 - Mastering</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently in contact with a french sound engineer by the name of Nicolas Essig, who has done work with Lana Del Rey, Coldplay, Brandon Flowers, and more. I feel that we would be the perfect pairing sonic-ly and I would absolutely love to be able to be mixed by him</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>              This current project as pierre XO is a 5-song compilation that encapsulates all that I've been through; love, heartbreak, joy, anger, escape &amp; adventure. The sound is along the lines of older alternative bands such as the Cure, the Killers, to more contemporary influences such as Crystal Castles, Phantogram &amp; Tame Impala. I am a huge fan of genre-blending and hope that what you'll hear is something new &amp; original. Emotional depth, accessibility, dance-ability and energy are all things I want to combine &amp; showcase.</p>
<p>Every project that I'm involved with I put 120% of myself in, never letting it go unfinished and following through even if that means skipped meals and lost sleep. My past work has resonated with many and I hope to inspire originality, emotional depth, and freedom with this current project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>      I've never liked money in art, and I've always tried to stray far from it as possible. Everything I've done in the past has been for free; from performing at charity events to releasing music videos. However, to create the best work, I would need more time and funds in order to write/record &amp; produce with a growing team. I want to be able to make the best quality work as I can, but it gets extremely difficult with the little finances and little time I have now. I have an innate desire to express myself and connect with people through art &amp; music, and I would love your help and support in making this possible!</p>
<p>     Yet no matter the circumstances, I will always find a way to create regardless. I will always live, eat, &amp; breathe art.</p>

I have written and recorded two albums previously, but<strong> this project is driven by my goal of getting onto television and film. </strong>I have learned a lot about myself from my previous works but<strong> I am ready to take my music to the next level. </strong>
</div><p>While I lived in France, I took the “Mumford and Sons” approach to writing music. I wrote as many songs as I could, then from sixty or so songs, I chose my best six. I recorded these songs at Splintered Wood Records with Cameron Kennedy. We were just two people for one big project, and I can’t thank him enough for the work he did. Through endless re-recordings and re-writes, the final product came to be. <strong>With <i>Closer </i>I am aiming to do my first national radio campaign in order to create licensing opportunities for myself, through Tinderbox music.</strong></p><p><strong>It’s All About The Music:</strong></p><p>Whether it be on national television or at a local show, at the end of the day, all I want is to make and play music that people will enjoy.

My dream is to write music for a living. I have written and recorded two albums previously, but this project is driven by my goal of getting onto television and film. I have learned a lot about myself from my previous works but I am ready to take my music to the next level. 
While I lived in France, I took the “Mumford and Sons” approach to writing music. I wrote as many songs as I could, then from sixty or so songs, I chose my best six. I recorded these songs at Splintered Wood Records with Cameron Kennedy. We were just two people for one big project, and I can’t thank him enough for the work he did. Through endless re-recordings and re-writes, the final product came to be. With Closer I am aiming to do my first national radio campaign in order to create licensing opportunities for myself, through Tinderbox music.It’s All About The Music:Whether it be on national television or at a local show, at the end of the day, all I want is to make and play music that people will enjoy.

<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>Patrick and Katie are two UAL graduates and filmmakers looking to breathe life into Cult Party's second single release ""Kiss (Two)"" from the album <i>Eternal Love and the Death of Everything</i> (2016).</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Be it depression, addiction or grievance, there is a constant and underlying desire to express the struggles one goes through in an overall bid to make peace with the world around us. Cult Party’s ""Kiss (Two)"" will look to communicate the anxiety and frustration that accompanies such inner turmoil through the medium of dance.</p>
<p>The music video follows a support group and its leader, as one by one, individuals anxiously reveal their innermost turmoil and anguish. The protagonist Nina, however, struggles to rally the right words to discuss her feelings of worry and instead abandons language for dance, as her own form of individual expression. From here on, Nina dances and interprets Cult Party's ""Kiss (Two)"", until herself and the character hit an invisible wall and come crashing back down to reality.</p>

<p><i>Lo-fi/folk artist, Leo Robinson.</i></p>
<p>Cult Party is a Manchester-based project born from the mind and heart of Leo Robinson. Beginning in 2011 with a tape recorder and an acute sense of longing, Cult Party has transformed over a period of five years as the recordings and live performances have grown in scale and ambition, manifesting in Leo's latest release <i>Eternal Love and the Death of Everything</i>, an album created in devotion to the complexities and beauty of ecological processes and the births and deaths that they encompass. The songs are bursting with Whitman-esque transcendental ideas, a flowing tapestry of personal folklore and a reverence for the traditional folk music of north America.</p>
<p>Leo is currently working on his visual art as well as a new album, which will be his first vinyl release, and is expected to be available before spring 2017.<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cultparty"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook.com/cultparty</a><br/><br/>Stream, purchase and download Cult Party's ""Kiss (Two)"" and the album <i>Eternal Love and the Death of Everything </i><a href=""http://maybles.bandcamp.com/album/eternal-love-and-the-death-of-everything"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

In addition to this, myself and Katie really wanted the chance to experiment with actual film stock because well, you just can't fake film.</p>
<p>Regarding the overall feel and message of the video, we look to capture the anxiety that comes with public speaking, especially in harkening back to those early school days in which speaking aloud in front of your peers would often terrify and disorientate. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474539241/lwjbag4trulnvvjwzqyd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

 MERCI POUR VOTRE SOUTIEN. ENGLISH VERSION Who are we ?We are SWEET SYSTEM Parisian jazz vocal trio : 3 swinging ladies !
 When first getting started over 15 years ago, we were mostly known for 1930's-40's swing music.  As time went on, we broadened our repertoire adding a mix of jazz standards and original compositions, as well as a few ""pop"" songs (seen through a ""jazz lens"") - always with a generous dose of swing!Among our accolades, we are most proud of having won the Grand Prix des Révélations at the famous Festival d’Antibes Juan-les-Pins in France. To date, we've recorded 2 albums on the label Black & Blue :  ""Jazz Fever"" (with the Dany Doriz Sextet  2004) and our own ""Living in Paris"" (2013). Our current stage show Jazz Club et Talons Aiguilles (""Jazz Club and Spike Heels"") has been playing in Paris at the Sentier des Halles Theatre since November 2016 (following successful runs at the Avignon Theatre Festival and Théâtre le Ranelagh). The show tells the story of three expatriate jazz singers as we share our adventures of Parisian life and love through a mix of scat, humour, dance and swing - that's entertainment! Our GoalOur dream is to pay tribute to the First Lady of Swing: ELLA FITZGERALD, for her 100th birthday (born April 25th, 1917).  Ella inspires us, excites us, motivates us ... We never cease to be enchanted by her tone, her phrasing, her virtuosity, freshness, humour, timing and above all her SWING. Ella is as fresh as the day she was born! This is why we are chomping at the bit to carry out the colossal task of transcribing and reharmonizing (for three voices, no less! )  her best-known songs and pyrotechnical SCATS to pay her homage as we know best.Your ParticipationFirst and foremost, by contributing to this project, you will help us all to realize this dream together.  Each and every contribution, no matter how big or small, is greatly appreciated by all three of us!  It's thanks to your participation that we can bring this dream project, so dear to our hearts, to fruition! You'll find a number of ""perks"" or rewards in the right-hand collumn - posters, signed CDs, comp tickets to the Happy 100th Birthday Ella concert at a famous jazz club in Paris (April 25th 2017) ... or maybe you'd like to co-produce the album or have your own serenade or private house concert... All this and more are possible! What we will be able to finance when you help us achieve our goal of 9,000€ :
studio time (6 days )

mastering (3 jours)
