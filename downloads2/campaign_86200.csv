Somos una banda de Metal de Quito, Ecuador. Nacimos a finales del 2003 y hasta el día de hoy hemos lanzado tres discos, algunos videos y hemos tocado en los más grandes festivales del Ecuador, habiendo recorrido gran parte del país. 



En Abril de este año, vamos a unir fuerzas con una banda de Finlandia, Khroma, con quienes vamos a realizar una gira de 22 fechas en 25 días, recorriendo más de 10000 kilómetros de carretera para visitar 22 ciudades de Bélgica, Suiza, España, Francia, Italia, Holanda, Alemania, Dinamarca, Polonia y República Checa. 


Como parte de este proyecto, viajará con nosotros el director Carlos Andrés Terán, de la productora Vertigo, con quien vamos a hacer un documental acerca de nuestras experiencias en Europa, y el encuentro entre bandas de Metal provenientes de partes muy distintas del mundo.



Somos una agrupación independiente que siempre ha funcionado en base a la autogestión. Hemos trabajado muy duro y hemos visto la recompensa en contar con un público propio, del cual estamos muy agradecidos.


En el 2015 lanzamos Portales, considerado un disco ""vital"", ""inmenso"" y uno de los 5 mejores discos ecuatorianos del año según Plan Arteria. Portales es la conclusión de varios años de trabajo y está ""hecho para reventar las cabezas del público metalero más exigente, a través de una combinación de elementos experimentales y agresividad"" (Radio Cocoa). 


Creemos en nuestro trabajo y queremos que lo escuchen fuera del Ecuador. Tenemos muchos planes para este año, pero necesitamos de tu apoyo para poderlos cumplir. Alcanzar el objetivo de esta campaña nos permitirá lograr un objetivo que tenemos desde hace mucho tiempo y cumplir con un sueño, que es recorrer otras partes del mundo tocando nuestra música. También nos permitirá crear más videos, otros documentales, y publicar nuestra música en nuevos formatos, todo lo cual podremos compartir con todos ustedes.   Lo que necesitamos Para cualquier banda es un reto llegar a tocar fuera de su país, y para nosotros han habido muchos obstáculos por sortear para llegar a este punto.

Necesitamos un mínimo de $3000 que nos permitirán cubrir necesidades de la gira como un transporte propio, alquilar equipos, y preparar la mercadería y discos que necesitamos para la gira y para las recompensas de esta campaña, así como ayudarnos a cubrir nuestros gastos.

Si logramos recaudar más de $5000 vamos a publicar un libro de tablaturas oficiales de todas las canciones de Colapso, que vendrá acompañado de un DVD con el documental de la gira, y se lo entregará como recompensa adicional a los contribuyentes de más de $45.

Nuestro compromiso
Para nosotros cumplir esta gira será la conclusión de un largo camino, y el principio del resto de nuestra existencia como Colapso. Creemos en la fuerza y calidad de nuestro material discográfico, y creemos en llegar con nuestra música a otros lugares del mundo. La presencia de bandas independientes ecuatorianas en Europa le abre las puertas al intercambio musical entre Ecuador y Europa, lo cual beneficia a nuestra escena local.
La calidad de nuestro trabajo durante los últimos 12 años es la garantía de que al apoyarnos, respaldas una iniciativa que va a rendir frutos.
Vamos a mantenerlos constantemente informados de nuestro recorrido, y de todo lo que vamos a conocer y hacer en Europa. Se parte de este viaje.
 Tu ayuda difundiendo esta campaña es muy importante. Por favor coméntala y compártela por redes sociales.

English:

We're a Metal band from Quito, Ecuador. We started around late 2003 and to date we have released three albums, a few videos, and we've played on the biggest stages in Ecuador, having played throughout most of the country.


Come April this year, we will join forces with Finnish band Khroma, with whom we'll do a 21-23 date tour of Europe over 24 days, traveling over 10000 km on the road to play in several cities of Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Poland and Czech Republic.


As part of this project, we'll travel with director Carlos Andrés Terán, of Vertigo productions, with whom we'll film a documentary about our experiences in Europe, and the meeting of bands from two very different parts of the world.

We're an independent band, and we've always had a DIY attitude. We've worked very hard and we've seen a reward in gaining a local audience of our own, for which we're very grateful.
In 2015 we released Portales, called a ""vital"" and ""immense"" album, and listed among the top 5 Ecuadorian albums of the year by Plan Arteria. Portales is the fruit of several years of work and it's ""made to blow away the most demanding metalhead audience, through a combination of experimental elements and aggressiveness"" (Radio Cocoa). 
We believe in the quality of our work, and we want our music to be heard outside of Ecuador. We have a lot of plans for this year, but we need your support to make them happen. Reaching the goal of this campaign would allow us to achieve a long held objective, and accomplish our dream of traveling to other parts of the world playing our music. It will also allow us to carry on creating more videos, new documentaries, and publishing our music in new formats, all of which we'll be able to share with you.
What we need
It's a challenge for any band to play outside of their home country, and there have been many obstacles for us before we could get to this point.
We need at least USD $3000 which will help us cover tour expenses such as transportation, gear rental, and making merch for sale and to reward your contributions, as well as cover other expenses.
If we can get over USD $5000 we'll publish an Official Tab Book with all of our songs, which will include a DVD of our Tour documentary and which will be added as a reward in every level over USD $45.
What you get
For USD $5: Our eternal gratefulness, plus your name will be included under Special Thanks in our documentary credits,  and a digital download of an exclusive poster, the lyrics and story of Colapso.
For USD $30: Your name will be included under Special Thanks in our documentary credits,  and a digital download of our entire discography (Portales, Destino Infierno, Después del Dolor), the official Colapso Tab Book, an exclusive poster, and the lyrics and story of Colapso.
For $45: You'll get a Limited Edition Official Tour T Shirt, your name will be included under Special Thanks in our documentary credits, a signed poster and stickers, and a digital download of our entire discography (Portales, Destino Infierno, Después del Dolor), the official Colapso Tab Book, an exclusive poster, and the lyrics and story of Colapso.
For $60: You'll get 2 Tickets to one of our shows on the tour, or to our homecoming show after we return to Quito, our album Portales in CD format, a Co-production credit in our tour documentary, a signed poster and stickers, and a digital download of our entire discography (Portales, Destino Infierno, Después del Dolor), the official Colapso Tab Book, an exclusive poster, and the lyrics and story of Colapso.
Por $120: You can choose between an original artwork by Diego Rojas (Design, Illustration), or 5 hours of drum, guitar, or bass lessons with the members of the band (Only available in Quito), and you'll get a Co-production credit in our tour documentary, a signed poster and stickers, and a digital download of our entire discography (Portales, Destino Infierno, Después del Dolor), the official Colapso Tab Book, an exclusive poster, and the lyrics and story of Colapso.
For $200: You'll get an invitation to a private concert and party outside of Quito (Doesn't include transportation), a Limited Edition Official Tour T Shirt and Hoodie, our album Portales in CD format, a Co-production credit in our tour documentary, a signed poster and stickers, and a digital download of our entire discography (Portales, Destino Infierno, Después del Dolor), the official Colapso Tab Book, an exclusive poster, and the lyrics and story of Colapso.
Our Commitment
For us, achieving this goal would mark the end of a long path, and the beginning of the rest of our existence as Colapso. We believe in the power and quality of our recorded material, and we believe in reaching other parts of the world with our music. The presence of independent bands from Ecuador in Europe helps establish the avenues for musical exchange between Ecuador and Europe for the benefit of our local scene.
The quality of our work of the last 12 years is our warranty that by supporting us, you're supporting an initiative that will accomplish its goals.
We'll keep you constantly informed of our activities, and of everything we're going to find and do in Europe. Join us in this journey.

<h3>THE ALBUM</h3>
<p>I've had the great fortune of leading a career that has stepped into many different musical settings. However, almost all of my creative work has been on behalf of other artists—I have not yet had the chance to put out my own music with my own stamp and signature on it. <strong>With your help, I'm thrilled that I'll be able to change that! This fall, I'll be recording my debut jazz album under my own name.</strong> I have been writing jazz music for a large portion of my life, and am eager to finally commemorate some of it on a recording. Releasing my own project will not only help to change how I view myself as an artist, but will also be fundamental in helping me look at how I approach future creative collaborations. </p>
<p>For those of you who don't yet know my work, I'll direct you to this video of a piece I wrote for jazz quartet and choir that was released on inauguration day of this year as a musical counterpoint to the current political rhetoric. All funds raised from this project were donated to the Brave New Films foundation. </p>

<p><strong>I'm very lucky to have a band of exceptionally gifted musicians. While I'm eternally grateful that they share their talents and friendship with me, I want to ensure that I pay them what they're worth. </strong>This is the chief motivation for initiating this campaign. The funds raised on Indiegogo will also cover the production costs, which are detailed below, but my central focus is on compensating my fellow musicians—just as I would like to be if the roles were reversed. Too often we undervalue the talents of musicians, and I don't want to in any way tarnish my music with that stigma. <b>Crowdfunding is the modern form of patronage</b>, a practice which has allowed artists to make art for most of human history. I need your help to allow all of my collaborators to do what they do best. While I can't promise a specific and monetary return on investment, a contribution to this campaign is direct patronage of musical talents at their finest.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The album will be recorded in Pittsburgh, PA at the beautiful Audible Images recording studio. Most of my core band resides in New York City, so I wanted to record somewhere on the East Coast, and I was offered a wonderful deal to record in Pittsburgh. This studio offers a gorgeous piano, a spacious room, and microphones that were used on classic jazz records in the 60s and 70s. I intend on recording the quintet all live in the same room, a practice that is rarely implemented in modern recording, to maintain the warmth and authenticity of sound that so many classic jazz records have. </p>

<h3>THE BOTTOM LINE</h3>
<p>Compensation for the musicians will make up about ⅔ of the budget. I will also be covering the quintet's travel costs from New York City (and myself from LA) to our rented studio in Pittsburgh, and their room and board while we're recording. Other costs include:</p>
<p>$1500—studio rental and engineering from Grammy Award-winning engineer Jay Dudt</p>
<p>$1000—Mastering, CD production, and distribution. I will be contributing my own funds for the remainder of these costs as they will exceed $1000.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>There are some wonderful perks that you can explore in exchange for donating to this campaign. From digital downloads of the music, to signed albums, producer credits, and some experiential perks, there's something for everybody! If you have any suggestions for perks that you would love to receive, please shoot me a message and we might be able to add it! </p>

<p>Indiegogo allows me to collect funds, even if the full goal isn't met. However, if I can't raise a minimum of $5000, I won't be able to make up the remainder and will have to pull the plug on the project. If I have not reached $5000 3 days prior to the end of the campaign, I will cancel the Indiegogo campaign and you will be refunded your contribution. <strong>Please know that when you contribute to the project, your card is charged immediately upon checking out</strong>. This is different than Kickstarter and I don't want anybody to be blindsided by it.</p>
<h3>THE STRETCH GOAL</h3>
<p>I'm a really big fan of vinyl. Once before on a collaborative album that I crowdfunded, we tried to promise top donors vinyl copies of the record only to find out just how expensive pressing vinyl is these days. We had to let them down easy, and I was dismayed that I couldn't own my own music on vinyl. SO, my ultimate stretch goal is to raise an additional $2500 to press a very limited run of vinyl copies of the music. If we achieve this, the top 10 donors would automatically receive a vinyl copy, and hopefully some other top donors would as well. I will keep two copies—one to frame on the wall, and one to wear out with the needle.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>CROWDFUNDING—MODERN PATRONAGE</h3>
<p>Patronage has been a central tenet of the arts since the dawn of society. Art is not created in a bubble. It reacts to the world around it, and it is facilitated and supported by those with the means to do so. As with everything in the global, digital age, patronage has morphed into a collaborative effort we call crowdfunding. Through your donations, you each become patrons of my art and thus become inherent parts of the artistry itself.<strong> I want to bring you all inside the process with me and share myself, both through my music and through behind-the-scenes content.</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge will be ensuring that I raise the full amount. If I cannot raise the $7500 I will be forced to face a painful decision of what I can sacrifice and still record my music. As it is, the musicians I'm hiring probably deserve 10x what I will be able to pay them after a successful campaign, but if I can't raise the full amount, then they probably won't be able to participate as they all have bottom lines they need to meet. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to a financial contribution, or if you're not in a place to contribute financially at all, a huge way to help this campaign is by spreading the word. Indiegogo offers some wonderful and intuitive share tools that you'll see right on this page. Please share this however is most natural and compelling for you—tell your friends and family on the phone, or in an email, or by carrier pigeon!</p>
<p>I can't thank you enough for taking the time to consider my endeavor, and I can't wait to share my music with you! </p>
</div></div>","THE ALBUM
I've had the great fortune of leading a career that has stepped into many different musical settings. However, almost all of my creative work has been on behalf of other artists—I have not yet had the chance to put out my own music with my own stamp and signature on it. With your help, I'm thrilled that I'll be able to change that! This fall, I'll be recording my debut jazz album under my own name. I have been writing jazz music for a large portion of my life, and am eager to finally commemorate some of it on a recording. Releasing my own project will not only help to change how I view myself as an artist, but will also be fundamental in helping me look at how I approach future creative collaborations. 
For those of you who don't yet know my work, I'll direct you to this video of a piece I wrote for jazz quartet and choir that was released on inauguration day of this year as a musical counterpoint to the current political rhetoric. All funds raised from this project were donated to the Brave New Films foundation. 

I'm very lucky to have a band of exceptionally gifted musicians. While I'm eternally grateful that they share their talents and friendship with me, I want to ensure that I pay them what they're worth. This is the chief motivation for initiating this campaign. The funds raised on Indiegogo will also cover the production costs, which are detailed below, but my central focus is on compensating my fellow musicians—just as I would like to be if the roles were reversed. Too often we undervalue the talents of musicians, and I don't want to in any way tarnish my music with that stigma. Crowdfunding is the modern form of patronage, a practice which has allowed artists to make art for most of human history. I need your help to allow all of my collaborators to do what they do best. While I can't promise a specific and monetary return on investment, a contribution to this campaign is direct patronage of musical talents at their finest.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The album will be recorded in Pittsburgh, PA at the beautiful Audible Images recording studio. Most of my core band resides in New York City, so I wanted to record somewhere on the East Coast, and I was offered a wonderful deal to record in Pittsburgh. This studio offers a gorgeous piano, a spacious room, and microphones that were used on classic jazz records in the 60s and 70s. I intend on recording the quintet all live in the same room, a practice that is rarely implemented in modern recording, to maintain the warmth and authenticity of sound that so many classic jazz records have. 
 
THE BAND
The core band is a quintet:
Daniel Weidlein—Saxophones
Christian Li—Piano
Mike Bono—Guitar
Raviv Markovitz—Bass
Roberto Giaquinto—Drums
I have played numerous shows in New York City with these four incredible musicians and am thrilled to have them be a part of this. Raviv and Mike were both part of the Jazz Mentor Fellowship with me at the Stanford Jazz Workshop, and Christian and Roberto are both graduates of Berkelee School of Music who each have a long list of impressive credits as touring musicians.
The band will also include numerous special guests. That instrumentation will include a string quartet, singers, and a clarinetist/flautist.

I’ve been dreaming of releasing an album since I first fell in love with writing songs at 12 years old, and I can’t tell you how crazy it is to be here, telling you all about this nearly-finished album I’ve worked on tirelessly ever since the idea of it was formed. </p><p>This album is pretty much my baby now, and I’ve been doing everything in my power to make it the best it can possibly be! I’ve fallen in love with watching it come together, and with a little help from you, this project can be something I can share and enjoy with you and the rest of the world! Now, I’m not about to sit here and ask for your support without giving you something in return, so besides the album itself, I’ve put together something pretty special that I think you’re gonna like :) </p><p> </p><p><strong>The Game Plan </strong></p><ul>
<li>I’ve written and recorded 11 complete songs, and I’m going to send each of them to be professionally mixed and mastered by a very talented friend of mine!</li>
<li>And in order stretch this album as far as it can go, I will also be developing a marketing and promotional plan, complete with advertising, playlisting, and maybe some really cool videos if I can raise the funds!</li>
<li>I’m sure you can imagine that all this won’t be cheap, but I’ve been planning this for an INSANELY long time to ensure that every penny will be used to its fullest potential—It'll all be totally worth it! </li>
</ul><p>I obviously want to make sure that this is all worthwhile for you as well! That’s why I’ve prepared a bunch of different gift packages with stickers and shirts, designed completely around “Insult to Injury” and all that It’s about! (or not about?) </p><p> </p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>On the surface, “Insult to Injury” can be interpreted as a 16-year-old girl dealing with a breakup by writing songs, and honestly that’s how it started so you weren’t too far off, haha! But as I tie up these last loose ends and see this project fully pull itself together, I can’t help but realize how much more it means. </p><p>I realized that, as I continued writing, I wasn't just writing about the breakup—It wasn’t entirely about that. Insult to Injury was also heavily inspired by the heartbreak of losing so many people as a result of it. It’s about figuring out who you’ve got around you, and finding out who was never there to begin with. It’s about change—drastic changes at that—and realizing that you were never the one in control of your situation.  </p><p>And most importantly, Insult to Injury is about remembering Who is. </p><p>Writing this album has been an incredibly healing process, and I can confidently say that I’ve finished it as a better person than I was before I began. I want nothing more than to share these songs with the people who have been in situations similar to mine (which is unfortunately nearly everybody hahaha) and I hope that they will bring you the same comfort they brought me :) </p><p> </p><p><strong>Other (free-er) ways you can help! </strong></p><p>I totally get it—some people won’t be able to support the project financially. And that’s totally okay because there’s a ton more you can do to help me get this album out into the world! </p><ul>
<li>Easiest thing you can do is <strong>share this fundraiser with everyone you know!</strong> Family, friends, anyone who would be interested in helping out (or anyone who likes wearing cool shirts!) If you post about it on Instagram, tag me (@leila.dandan) because I’d love to see it! </li>
<li>
<strong>Hang out with me on social media</strong>! Not only will I be very happy to see you there, but every like, comment, follow, and share makes the algorithm very happy as well haha. My stuff will have more of a chance to be seen because of it! </li>

That’s why I’ve prepared a bunch of different gift packages with stickers and shirts, designed completely around “Insult to Injury” and all that It’s about! (or not about?)  Why?On the surface, “Insult to Injury” can be interpreted as a 16-year-old girl dealing with a breakup by writing songs, and honestly that’s how it started so you weren’t too far off, haha! But as I tie up these last loose ends and see this project fully pull itself together, I can’t help but realize how much more it means. I realized that, as I continued writing, I wasn't just writing about the breakup—It wasn’t entirely about that. Insult to Injury was also heavily inspired by the heartbreak of losing so many people as a result of it. It’s about figuring out who you’ve got around you, and finding out who was never there to begin with. It’s about change—drastic changes at that—and realizing that you were never the one in control of your situation.  And most importantly, Insult to Injury is about remembering Who is. Writing this album has been an incredibly healing process, and I can confidently say that I’ve finished it as a better person than I was before I began. I want nothing more than to share these songs with the people who have been in situations similar to mine (which is unfortunately nearly everybody hahaha) and I hope that they will bring you the same comfort they brought me :)  Other (free-er) ways you can help! I totally get it—some people won’t be able to support the project financially. And that’s totally okay because there’s a ton more you can do to help me get this album out into the world! 
Easiest thing you can do is share this fundraiser with everyone you know! Family, friends, anyone who would be interested in helping out (or anyone who likes wearing cool shirts!) If you post about it on Instagram, tag me (@leila.dandan) because I’d love to see it! 

Hang out with me on social media! Not only will I be very happy to see you there, but every like, comment, follow, and share makes the algorithm very happy as well haha. My stuff will have more of a chance to be seen because of it!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Short Summary</p>
<p>I have been playing classical guitar since I was nine and electric since I was thirteen. Music has been my  passion since then.</p>
<p>This  extraordinary  year has been bad in many ways but has also brought an opportunity for reflection and meditation. It has left us time to think on what really matters for us. In my case I have started to write rock songs and play the electric guitar again. At the same time, I have composed and re-arranged pieces for classical guitar as never before. </p>
<p>This project is about bringing my two passions together, and I am offering you an  opportunity  to be part of this journey. The aim is to record two complete albums, one of my own compositions  for classical guitar, and another with rock songs inspired by the music I listened to and love from the 70s and 90s. Rock in its most pure  and savage form. The lyrics are bilingual, in English and Spanish. Some songs were written twenty years ago, but most of them are from 2020. For the Prog Rock LP Recording I count with the legend from Uruguay, Popo Romano in the bass and in the drums Rickard Jonsson from Sweden. Both musicians have already recorded three singles, to be released soon as a pre-launch of the final Double LP recording. </p>
<p><strong>About me</strong></p>
<p>My name is Sebastián Caldas. I was born in Uruguay and moved to Sweden when I was just two years old.</p>
<p>I started playing a classical guitar in Malmö with Inger Alebo when I was nine and have not stopped since then.</p>
<p>Being the second youngest of five brothers and a sister I was very much influenced by their musical tastes , mainly heavy metal from the 80s and the vinyl albums of Herbert von Karajan directing Beethoven’s Symphonies  that my father listened to , as well as folk music from Latin America.</p>
<p>When I was twelve, I moved back to South America, and continued to study classical guitar with Anselmo Grau and Regina Carrizo</p>
<p>When I first heard Yngwie Malmsteen it blew my mind, so I borrowed an electric guitar , and formed a band. We played from Black Sabbath to Ugly Kid Joe, Megadeth and our own songs.</p>
<p>After high school I decided to focus on the classical guitar and the rock music was put on ice.</p>
<p>I got a Bachelor´s Degree from Musikene in classical guitar , having Marco Socías as teacher and a master’s degree from Musikhögskolan in Piteå with Jan-Olof Eriksson.</p>
<p>I have recorded so far two solo albums with the label</p>

<p>Sådan lyder første linje af pladens allerførste sang. Modet svigter os alle fra tid til anden - når vi igen er klar, som jeg blev det, efter mange år med bl.a. en stemme der drillede - så vil vi også gerne hjælpe andre til at gøre det samme. Mine syv sange på pladen er en tur tilbage til mine erindringer, udfordringer og personlige aha-oplevelser, og det er mit håb, at andre vil kunne gøre brug af sangene til at lade sig inspirere og finde al deres mod frem. Jeg hedder <strong>Rie Hagbard</strong>, jeg er uddannet sanger og musikunderviser fra Rytmisk Musikkonservatorium, og jeg har her en hel kuffert fuld af hjertelige og livsbekræftende sange til jer!</p>
<h3>God musik fortjener god lyd!</h3>
<p>Og det gør de lyttende ører også. Jeg har været så heldig at få Gateway Music til at distribuere denne kommende plade, men økonomien står jeg helt selv for. Og der er mange udgifter i forbindelse med op-øvning, indspilning og musikproduktion. Jeg søger 10.000,-, som vil gå til leje af studiet, hvor sangene er blevet indspillet. Som støtte til mit projekt får du en masse retur: Du får naturligvis dit eget eksemplar af cd'en (som har release i efteråret 2018) og bliver krediteret med navns nævnelse. Dernæst er der andre musikalske forkælelser i vente, afhængigt af, hvilken beløbstørrelse, du vælger. Takkegaver såsom koncertbilletter til Rie Hagbard &amp; trio, koncertbilletter til Rie Hagbard &amp; Trio kombineret med drikkevarer, koncertbilletter til gospelkoncert, sangworkshop-gavekort og performance-gavekort. Skulle vi ikke være nået helt i mål med crowdfundingen, vil du ikke mærke noget til det; du modtager gaverne uanset udfaldet!</p>
<h3>En tur tilbage går alle steder hen</h3>
<p>I efteråret 2017 stod jeg med min pianist i Gl. Holte Kirke og opførte for første gang disse syv sange foran et publikum - og det blev en fantastisk aften med nærvær, glæde, grin, tårer og masser af genkendende nik og blikke rundt omkring fra tilskuerrækkerne. ""En tur tilbage"" rummer noget for enhver smag, og følelsesmæssigt bliver man bragt vidt omkring når man tager med på den lille rejse, pladen udgør. En koncertgæst udtaler:</p>
<p>""Så snart, jeg hørte de første sætninger sunget, blev jeg draget og fløj med på en magisk rejse. Nærmest som at sidde i den flyvende kuffert i Tivoli og få historier fortalt - sådan blev også jeg fløjet igennem et landskab af både smerte, håb og kærlighed. For mig er det musik, som virkelig fortjener at blive delt i verden.""</p>
<p><strong>Støt mit pladeprojekt</strong> hvis du elsker musik og gode tekster og hvis du har lyst til at hjælpe en kunstnerisk sjæl som min til at finde sit karrieremæssige springbræt og komme ud over kanten og sprede lys, stemning, glæde og genkendelighed blandt en masse mennesker. Og fordi verden aldrig kan få for meget dejlig, rørende og swingende musik. </p>
<p>Har du ikke økonomisk mulighed for at støtte tilblivelsen af pladen, håber jeg at du vil hjælpe mig videre ved at dele nyheden om min crowdfunding på de forskellige medier, du har adgang til. Det i sig selv vil også være et stort bidrag! På forhånd tusind tak.</p>

Sådan lyder første linje af pladens allerførste sang. Modet svigter os alle fra tid til anden - når vi igen er klar, som jeg blev det, efter mange år med bl.a. en stemme der drillede - så vil vi også gerne hjælpe andre til at gøre det samme. Mine syv sange på pladen er en tur tilbage til mine erindringer, udfordringer og personlige aha-oplevelser, og det er mit håb, at andre vil kunne gøre brug af sangene til at lade sig inspirere og finde al deres mod frem. Jeg hedder Rie Hagbard, jeg er uddannet sanger og musikunderviser fra Rytmisk Musikkonservatorium, og jeg har her en hel kuffert fuld af hjertelige og livsbekræftende sange til jer!
God musik fortjener god lyd!
Og det gør de lyttende ører også. Jeg har været så heldig at få Gateway Music til at distribuere denne kommende plade, men økonomien står jeg helt selv for. Og der er mange udgifter i forbindelse med op-øvning, indspilning og musikproduktion. Jeg søger 10.000,-, som vil gå til leje af studiet, hvor sangene er blevet indspillet. Som støtte til mit projekt får du en masse retur: Du får naturligvis dit eget eksemplar af cd'en (som har release i efteråret 2018) og bliver krediteret med navns nævnelse. Dernæst er der andre musikalske forkælelser i vente, afhængigt af, hvilken beløbstørrelse, du vælger. Takkegaver såsom koncertbilletter til Rie Hagbard & trio, koncertbilletter til Rie Hagbard & Trio kombineret med drikkevarer, koncertbilletter til gospelkoncert, sangworkshop-gavekort og performance-gavekort. Skulle vi ikke være nået helt i mål med crowdfundingen, vil du ikke mærke noget til det; du modtager gaverne uanset udfaldet!
En tur tilbage går alle steder hen
I efteråret 2017 stod jeg med min pianist i Gl. Holte Kirke og opførte for første gang disse syv sange foran et publikum - og det blev en fantastisk aften med nærvær, glæde, grin, tårer og masser af genkendende nik og blikke rundt omkring fra tilskuerrækkerne. ""En tur tilbage"" rummer noget for enhver smag, og følelsesmæssigt bliver man bragt vidt omkring når man tager med på den lille rejse, pladen udgør. En koncertgæst udtaler:
""Så snart, jeg hørte de første sætninger sunget, blev jeg draget og fløj med på en magisk rejse. Nærmest som at sidde i den flyvende kuffert i Tivoli og få historier fortalt - sådan blev også jeg fløjet igennem et landskab af både smerte, håb og kærlighed. For mig er det musik, som virkelig fortjener at blive delt i verden.""
Støt mit pladeprojekt hvis du elsker musik og gode tekster og hvis du har lyst til at hjælpe en kunstnerisk sjæl som min til at finde sit karrieremæssige springbræt og komme ud over kanten og sprede lys, stemning, glæde og genkendelighed blandt en masse mennesker. Og fordi verden aldrig kan få for meget dejlig, rørende og swingende musik. 
Har du ikke økonomisk mulighed for at støtte tilblivelsen af pladen, håber jeg at du vil hjælpe mig videre ved at dele nyheden om min crowdfunding på de forskellige medier, du har adgang til. Det i sig selv vil også være et stort bidrag! På forhånd tusind tak.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi Everyone!</p>
<p>I'm <strong>Rachael Fahim</strong> and I have been invited to perform at <strong>SXSW Festival</strong> - all the way over in Austin, TX. This is a <i>huge</i> opportunity for an aussie artist like me, and also a huge undertaking for me. Which is why I am hoping that you will get involved and help me and my band get from this little island over the Pacific Ocean and onto that stage in Texas.</p>
<p>SXSW is happening 11th-17th March 2019. It's one of the biggest festivals in the world helping emerging artists like me get onto the world stage, and for everyone who loves music it is right at the heart of our hearts! To even be invited means our hard work has paid off, but now I am asking for your help to actually get there. I wish it was as simple as jumping on the next flight...</p>
<p>We are looking for support to help us do this thing properly! To help arrange visas to perform, and to get our instruments (and ourselves) over to Austin safely. An appearance at SXSW also involves finding somewhere for me and my band to sleep at night, keeping the band alive and also putting our best foot forward to stand out amongst all the other acts there. </p>
<p>Every little helps, and we want to try and give back to every person who gets involved! Check out the perks of the campaign (hint: look just a little to your right...) for what I want to send you to say thank you for your support. From a simple but heartfelt thank you note, right through to an incredible package of merch plus money-can't-buy opportunities! Even if you can't make a pledge, please feel free to get involved by spreading the word - and even just listening to my music.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has already helped us on our way - you are all incredible! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I grew up outside New York City, and was fortunate to be surrounded by the the arts.  My father was a concert booking agent, and my mother an artist.  There was always a variety of music playing in our house, particularly the classic Broadway musicals of the 50s and Jazz.  Early influences include my dad's clients Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Carlos Montoya. This background led me to pursue degrees in music at Bard College and NYU, where I created everything from piano sonatas to computer generated pieces based on fractals. </p>
<p>While my songwriting fits within the broad ""modern folk"" category, I believe what sets it apart are the subtle influences from my jazz and chamber music experiences that come through.  Arcadia is  my most multi-textured record to date, and includes a great array of singers and musicians including Jud Caswell (producer/guitar), Bill Holden (dobro), Colin Kolmar (percussion), Jim Lyden (bass), Alex Millan (bass), Kevin Oates (cello), Janice O'Rourke (vocals), and Ben Hunsberger (organ, piano). </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $3,000  to help to make sure we can finalize the recording, mixing, mastering and manufacturing of this record, and have it in hand when I attend the 2018 NEFRA conference, the 2nd weekend of November.  Having something brand new to offer will be a great way to pique the interest of the presenters and DJ's I will be meeting there.  </p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunities I have had to perform regularly in Maine over the past 15+ years, as well as the recognition my songs have received: ""Change"" from Arcadia is a finalist in the 2018 Maine Songwriter's Association Song Competition, and I placed 3rd in the 2016 competition, I was also an 8-time finalist in the New England Songwriting Awards.  However, I believe now is the time to introduce my music to a wider audience and let these songs realize their greater potential.</p>
<p>This record will get made eventually with or without your help, but it will take longer if I am funding it on my own.  And believe it or not, I have material for another record waiting in the wings, so let's get it done and out there for the world (or at least New England) to hear, so I can sell a few, get some new gigs to generate funds to pay for the next one so I don't have to ask for your help! :-)</p>
<p>What do you get out of all this? The main thing is you will be the first ones to have the record in your hands, but depending on what you contribute there are a range of other additional goodies ranging from a complete collection of lyrics from all the songs I've recorded since 2004, to a live concert in your living room. </p>
<p>I understand not everyone is in a position to make a monetary contribution, but you can still help-- -please spread the word - tell your friends - share on social, etc.  THANK YOU!</p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Hey guys! My name is Deborah Puig and I am a solo violinist hailing from Fredericksburg, Virginia. This will be my first ever original album, and I am super stoked to be able to work on this with Asher at Kingship Recording. However, in order to reach my goal, I’ll need the help from all of my wonderful supporters!</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>As any soloist, I am a 100% DIY artist. I am starting off without management, funding all of my videos, promotional material, and musical endeavors on my own.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $4,000 that will go towards this album. That includes:</p>
<p>- Full production of 12 songs with Asher Condit in Avon, CT (Pre-Production, Recording, Mixing and Mastering)</p>
<p>- CD Duplication </p>
<p>- Costs of any IndieGoGo Perks and Rewards (Shipping and Handling, the costs of creating some of these prizes, etc)</p>
<p>Any money raised over the $4,000 will go towards:</p>
<p>-My music video for an original song</p>
<p>-Funding an album release party that everyone will be able to attend</p>
<p>I am so incredibly excited to be doing this, and even more excited to include all of my friends, family, and supporters as I start of on this musical journey. As a shoutout to all those that support and back me on this project and future projects to come, I will be offering special prizes and packages!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This LP will be a huge milestone for me as I finally start down a path to chase my dreams of inspiring the world. Every contribution, no matter how small it may seem to some, can make a huge difference. It tells me that not only do I have such wonderful people supporting me, but that I CAN make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Being a solo artist has many risks and challenges, especially on the financial front. I, like most, have bills to pay, and cannot put all of my earnings into this project to make it take wing, as much as I would like to. It is also not something that happens overnight, there are other people involved with this project, spending their time and resources towards this. However, with the support and love I have received, it has given me the strength to pursue this at whatever cost it may be. With your help, we can do anything, even change the world with music.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Any donation amount helps me towards this goal, but if you're unable to donate, sharing and spreading around my Indiegogo video goes a long way! Anytime you share my cover video, indiegogo video, or even my page with friends and family it goes a long way towards supporting my project. Any way that you guys can support will help me and I love you all! </p>

We've been playing together as Says Things for about three years, and in other configurations much longer. Over the years we've developed a deep rapport and a unique improvisational language. You can listen to two (unmastered) tracks from the album <a href=""https://saysthings.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here!</a></p>
<h3>The Album</h3>
<p>The album is fully recorded and mixed.

We're thinking of this as a preorder as opposed to crowdfunding, so we're not adding a bunch of crazy ""perks"" - basically just the album!

<h2 class=""heading""><strong><span>WHY DO SOME PEOPLE FEEL FRAZZLED, ISOLATED AND BURNT OUT,</span></strong></h2>
<h2 class=""heading1""><strong><span>WHILE OTHERS STAY CALM AND CONNECTED, NO MATTER WHAT?</span></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>What's the idea?</strong></h2>
<p>Amidst terrifying talk of nuclear threat, doom and destruction, a <strong>positive atomic energy</strong> is being revived in the heart of Galilee, Israel, giving a comforting feeling of Instant Calm. A powerful application of sound waves, as used in pre-biblical times for healing and transformational purposes.  </p>
<h2>What secrets does our past hold for our health and wellbeing today?</h2>
<p><strong>Share an ancient healing and transformational tool used for deep  calm, relaxation, rejuvenation, focus and clarity, especially during turbulent times of change. </strong></p>
<p>In ancient times the atomic use of sound was recognized as a powerful healing &amp; transformational tool. There was strong cosmic connection with ancient sites and structures. Though this power, rooted in the irresistible magnetic force, has been largely forgotten for the last 3000 years, it is my life's work to revive these secrets for our benefit today.</p>
<h2><strong>Who am I and what is Voices of Eden? </strong></h2>
<p>My name is Eliana Gilad, Founder of Voices of Eden Ancient Healing &amp; Transformational music, author of forthcoming ""Miriam's Secret, Discovering Your Inner Well of Wisdom"".</p>
<p>A former CBS broadcaster with an extensive academic and practical background in history, archaeology, ancient music and the University of Life, it's been my passion to rediscover this ancient music modality, prove its power by pioneering international medical research, and find practical applications for it to make our world a better place for all today.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I call my discovery “Voices of Eden”?  Imagine what will happen as individuals connect to their inner truth, listen to their authentic voice, trust it and express it. Each voice gets heard and creates a united whole. Voices of Eden is a practical experiment of creating Eden on earth.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Now's the time to spread the word! </strong></h3>
<p><strong>My team and I have been invited to present at the International Archaeology &amp; Music Conference in China 21-25 October 2012, and at TEDxVail Women Conference in USA  first week of December 2012.</strong></p>
<p>Voices of Eden music empowers and inspires transformation as we reconnect with the magnetic feminine power found at the earth's core. Ancient healing and transformational music was practiced in the ancient near east to help people remain balanced and focused during times of change.  Unique and universal, a bridge between East and West, this sonic healing application is being revived today for modern use.</p>
<h2>What's the plan?</h2>
<p>1)  We have planned a live event this month at an ancient healing music site in Galilee which will attune folks to the magnetic energy of the spot as we demonstrate a live application of this special music.</p>
<p>2) We'll record perfectly imperfect human voices crooing a Cosmic Melody, which I composed at the turn of the Millenium, inspired by a collaboration with Barbara Marx Hubbard and her unique ""Attuner"" instrument, tuned to the vibratory rate of the earth's rotation. </p>
<p>3) We'll prepare a multi-media presentation incorporating the recording from the live event.</p>
<p>4) We'll travel to China and the US to the International Conferences we are invited to with this presentation, to share the experience of this ancient healing and transformational music modality, with its keys to improve our lives today.</p>
<p>5) <strong>We have been invited by the International Music Archaeology Conference organizers to present a reconstructed Ancient Musical Instrument by Israeli world authority Moshe Frumin <a href=""http://www.moshefrumin.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.moshefrumin.com</a>, which will be played at the Concert of Restored Ancient Musical Instruments at the Conference in China.</strong></p>

<h2>How can you help?</h2>
</div>
<h3>We have invested $10,000 of our personal money (not including our time) to seed this project, so that you and 1000s of others can experience its power too.  </h3>
<h3>We now need $8000 to get to China and the US, and to produce the live recording and multi-media presentation. All our expenses are paid once we get there.</h3>
<h3>Here's how the $8,000 will be spent:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>2 return flight tickets to China and USA from Israel. (Event organizers in China and USA are covering our expenses once we arrive ) - $5,000.</p>
<p>Organizing, recording and filming the live event at an ancient healing music site in Galilee, Israel, to demonstrate a practical application of this atomic use of sound - $1,300.</p>
<p>Producing a multi-media presentation including video editing, graphics, website, handouts for the prestigeous International Events in Suzhou, China and Vail, USA - $1,700.</p>
<p>We promise that all funds raised will go directly to record and film this Ancient Healing Music modality, and to enable us to travel to present this music live world-wide, so we can <strong>spread the word </strong>about the revival of the secret keys to calm and focus. </p>
<p>If we do not reach the target, we won't be able to take up the invitations to present at the conferences.</p>
<p>If we exceed the target, we will be able to invest more and improve the quality of the presentation material, and travel to more destinations to give live workshops.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Why support us?</h2>
<p>By supporting us in funding this project so we can present at the Conferences, it’s a chance for you to experience Voices of Eden music, to listen to and express your unique voice as we encourage you to sing along and feel the healing benefits from the inside out. To describe more specifically:</p>
<p>We will produce, record and film a unique event at an ancient archaeological healing site in Galilee, Israel where regular people will gather to learn the powerful Cosmic Melody, and sing 100% naturally, no synthesizers, no ""performance"", but truly authentic power. </p>
<p>The recording and film of the event will be incorporated in a multi-media presentation to be shown at the prestigious International Conferences of Music &amp; Archaeology in Suzhou and Beijing, China, and at TEDxVail Women in Colorado, USA.</p>
<p>We will present at these events as invited, and give full credit to all our supporters in our PR and at the events, and as this material spreads around the world.</p>
<h2>We've been spreading the word, now it's time for more</h2>
<p>We've presented 3 times at the <strong>United Nations</strong>, being cited ""for helping so many people all over the world"" and in Beijing, China last year, exploring the strong healing music ties between ancient China and ancient Israel.</p>
<h3><strong>We're passionate about spreading this medically proven ancient healing music modality to help you and and many others as possible world-wide today.</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes slow can be the fastest route, and less is more. Attuned to the magnetic core, We are here to provide a safe environment so that each voice can be heard and appreciated. </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello, my name is Sean Christopher Dockery and I am a New-Age music composer.  I am trying to raise funds for a proper promotion of my newest album, Sean Christopher (featuring Andrew Sords) - Transcendence.  The promotion will be with New Vision Promotions, which will cost approximately $1700 (please see the breakdown of the costs below).  I would also like to advertise the album on Echoes, which is one of the largest broadcasters of New Age music in the world.  One week of advertising is approximately $750. </p>
<p>Transcendence is a New-Age album which features beautiful violin performances by renowned concert violinist Andrew Sords (<a href=""http://www.andrewsords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.andrewsords.com</a>).  The album also features beautiful children &amp; adult choirs.  Transcendence took me the better part of 1 year to compose, arrange, and produce and I honestly believe that it is my best work to date. </p>
<p>I used a similar promotion for my last, Sojourns, and it made a huge impact on getting my album to most of the New-Age music broadcasters in the world, which lead to my music being heard by a whole lot of people…..which is the reason I keep writing.  My wife (Ann Marie) and I were in a better financial situation at that particular time and didn’t have a baby to support, which we do now, so we had no problems back then in pulling out a credit card to finance that promotion.  Now that we have our beautiful baby-boy we cannot afford to get into more debt to do a proper promotion on my newest CD……hence the reason Ann and I thought that Indiegogo could possibly be the answer to our prayers regarding this…..since the costs of producing the album has exhausted our saving for the time being.</p>
<p>Every penny literally would help us in our goal with the album.  Even if you cannot afford anything, just letting your friends and family know about our Indiegogo campaign would be a huge help.  Also, if you know anyone who enjoys New-Age music please send them to my website at <a href=""http://www.SeanChristopher.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.SeanChristopher.com</a>.  Every CD I sell will help in our cause.  </p>
<p>If I fall short of my goal I will still do the New Vision promo (as long as I can raise at least close to half the $1700 needed for that) we would then, hesitantly, pull put a credit card out to complete this, because having my album heard by lovers of New-Age music is extremely important to Ann and I.  If Ann and I are fortunate enough to <strong><em>exceed</em></strong> the financial goals here on Indiegogo, we will use that to pay for extra advertising time on Echoes.  </p>

<p> </p></div>","Hello, my name is Sean Christopher Dockery and I am a New-Age music composer.  I am trying to raise funds for a proper promotion of my newest album, Sean Christopher (featuring Andrew Sords) - Transcendence.  The promotion will be with New Vision Promotions, which will cost approximately $1700 (please see the breakdown of the costs below).  I would also like to advertise the album on Echoes, which is one of the largest broadcasters of New Age music in the world.  One week of advertising is approximately $750. 
Transcendence is a New-Age album which features beautiful violin performances by renowned concert violinist Andrew Sords (www.andrewsords.com).  The album also features beautiful children & adult choirs.  Transcendence took me the better part of 1 year to compose, arrange, and produce and I honestly believe that it is my best work to date. 
I used a similar promotion for my last, Sojourns, and it made a huge impact on getting my album to most of the New-Age music broadcasters in the world, which lead to my music being heard by a whole lot of people…..which is the reason I keep writing.  My wife (Ann Marie) and I were in a better financial situation at that particular time and didn’t have a baby to support, which we do now, so we had no problems back then in pulling out a credit card to finance that promotion.  Now that we have our beautiful baby-boy we cannot afford to get into more debt to do a proper promotion on my newest CD……hence the reason Ann and I thought that Indiegogo could possibly be the answer to our prayers regarding this…..since the costs of producing the album has exhausted our saving for the time being.
Every penny literally would help us in our goal with the album.  Even if you cannot afford anything, just letting your friends and family know about our Indiegogo campaign would be a huge help.  Also, if you know anyone who enjoys New-Age music please send them to my website at www.SeanChristopher.com.  Every CD I sell will help in our cause.  
If I fall short of my goal I will still do the New Vision promo (as long as I can raise at least close to half the $1700 needed for that) we would then, hesitantly, pull put a credit card out to complete this, because having my album heard by lovers of New-Age music is extremely important to Ann and I.  If Ann and I are fortunate enough to exceed the financial goals here on Indiegogo, we will use that to pay for extra advertising time on Echoes.  
Thank you very much for looking at my Indiegogo project.    
God-bless,
Sean Christopher Dockery

<p>You may have seen me about your town. I am the self-produced vocalist, romantic polyglot born in San Francisco, bred in New York City, and fed in Paris, the City of Lights.</p>
<p>For years, I have funded all of my music endeavors, studio time, and mixing sessions.</p>
<p>This past year, my single ""Psychosomatic Love"" hit the Northern California airwaves.</p>
<p>I now need your help to finance the official music video to my hit single, and make it a global sensation! </p>

<p>Hitchcockian and psychological, ""Psychosomatic Love"" began upon seeing a beautiful girl on a rainy Parisian Metro ride. Brief dialogue, a date in the park, and failed attempts to kiss, then to remeet, the romance went nowhere fast, leaving me a tad sad, head in hand, and eventually pen in pad, walking about the majestic town obsessively searching for this elusive beauty. </p>
<p>With a bit of a broken heart, and yearning for fulfillment, the never-begun never-ended love story gave me the material for a great song. And thus, in a small Parisian bedroom, crooning words of desire, was born the early draft to my hit single, ""Psychosomatic Love,"" for which, after relocating continents, 2 years of reworking, and being featured on the radio, I am finally making the music video!</p>
<p>I could not be more excited... And so should you.</p>

<p>I am a huge fan of Mr. Hitchcock, the suspense king, and particularly of his masterpiece, Psycho, a huge influence for this video. </p>

<p>A touch autobiographical, the video will show me spotting off in the distance, in the middle of downtown San Francisco, the beautiful silhouette of a fleeting woman. </p>
<p>I follow her, further investigating who this beautiful creature may be, finally finding her in the most remote and cinematic of places: an isolated motel.</p>

<p>We found a location, a VACANT MOTEL, in the middle of California, Hitchcockian regalia and cinematic quality intact, where a great part of the video will be shot. I cannot stress the importance and beauty of this motel, preserved in 1960's style. I am super excited for this alone.</p>

<p>The other part of the music video will be shot in studio, where landscapes will be projected onto a white wall as, sitting in a classic lowrider, I simulate driving across the projected Northern California Coast, flowers in hand, hair in the wind, yearning to finally meet my destined love, one-on-one!</p>

<p>This driving sequence is inspired by Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 2, when Thelma is driving to seek her vengeance. Tarantino plays homage to classic films while giving it a new spin, by placing Thelma in a studio, projecting the pre-recorded footage, a vintage touch in our modern age.</p>

<p>All of the money received will be going to the production and completion of this music video.</p>
<p>Locations are often the most expensive, yet the most important aspect of film making. Here are the lowest costs we've managed to obtain for the production of the epic video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motel Location: $4000 for 24 hours</li>
<li>Studio: $1000 for 10-hour day</li>
<li>Lowrider Car: $500 for a 10-hour day</li>
<li>Cinema Quality Camera and Lens Package with Support Rig: $1875 (special favor rate!) per weekend</li>
<li>Transportation (equipment and crew) and feeding our volunteer crew: $500</li>
<li>Post-Production Costs: Did you know that a basic edit for a 4-minute music video takes at least 30-40 hours of work? There is compositing, special effects, and color grading for a high-concept video such as this one, adding up to 80-120 hours of work. Although a friend has volunteered to help, this significant time investment deserves a little bit of compensation.</li>

You may have seen me about your town. I am the self-produced vocalist, romantic polyglot born in San Francisco, bred in New York City, and fed in Paris, the City of Lights.
For years, I have funded all of my music endeavors, studio time, and mixing sessions.
This past year, my single ""Psychosomatic Love"" hit the Northern California airwaves.
I now need your help to finance the official music video to my hit single, and make it a global sensation! 

Beginnings in Paris, radio play in Northern California, and soon in a home near you!
Hitchcockian and psychological, ""Psychosomatic Love"" began upon seeing a beautiful girl on a rainy Parisian Metro ride. Brief dialogue, a date in the park, and failed attempts to kiss, then to remeet, the romance went nowhere fast, leaving me a tad sad, head in hand, and eventually pen in pad, walking about the majestic town obsessively searching for this elusive beauty. 
With a bit of a broken heart, and yearning for fulfillment, the never-begun never-ended love story gave me the material for a great song. And thus, in a small Parisian bedroom, crooning words of desire, was born the early draft to my hit single, ""Psychosomatic Love,"" for which, after relocating continents, 2 years of reworking, and being featured on the radio, I am finally making the music video!
I could not be more excited... And so should you.



(Drumroll...)
Alfred Hitchcock.
I am a huge fan of Mr. Hitchcock, the suspense king, and particularly of his masterpiece, Psycho, a huge influence for this video. 
Alfred Hitchcock
Like a great Hitchcock film, the video will be suspenseful from the get go.
A touch autobiographical, the video will show me spotting off in the distance, in the middle of downtown San Francisco, the beautiful silhouette of a fleeting woman. 
I follow her, further investigating who this beautiful creature may be, finally finding her in the most remote and cinematic of places: an isolated motel.

We found a location, a VACANT MOTEL, in the middle of California, Hitchcockian regalia and cinematic quality intact, where a great part of the video will be shot. I cannot stress the importance and beauty of this motel, preserved in 1960's style. I am super excited for this alone.


The other part of the music video will be shot in studio, where landscapes will be projected onto a white wall as, sitting in a classic lowrider, I simulate driving across the projected Northern California Coast, flowers in hand, hair in the wind, yearning to finally meet my destined love, one-on-one!

This driving sequence is inspired by Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 2, when Thelma is driving to seek her vengeance. Tarantino plays homage to classic films while giving it a new spin, by placing Thelma in a studio, projecting the pre-recorded footage, a vintage touch in our modern age.




And a major part of the team is here, to make this vision come true. Jeremy Peel, creative, art and music video director is onboard to co-direct this video!

Music Video Director and Cinematographer
Check out Jeremy's work www.jeremypeel.com

We've gathered a complete film crew consisting of friends in the film business who have offered their support for this project.


Much to be invested and more to be gained. The cinematic video calls for a cinematic budget (a 4-minute cinematic budget that is).
All of the money received will be going to the production and completion of this music video.
Locations are often the most expensive, yet the most important aspect of film making. Here are the lowest costs we've managed to obtain for the production of the epic video:

Motel Location: $4000 for 24 hours
Studio: $1000 for 10-hour day
Lowrider Car: $500 for a 10-hour day
Cinema Quality Camera and Lens Package with Support Rig: $1875 (special favor rate!) per weekend
Transportation (equipment and crew) and feeding our volunteer crew: $500
Post-Production Costs: Did you know that a basic edit for a 4-minute music video takes at least 30-40 hours of work? There is compositing, special effects, and color grading for a high-concept video such as this one, adding up to 80-120 hours of work. Although a friend has volunteered to help, this significant time investment deserves a little bit of compensation.



We will begin shooting 4 weeks after this campaign ends. This gives us ample time to prepare every scene, book the locations, gear, crew, and extras.
The video will be released and ready for global exposure early 2014.

<h3>Vi vil beholde Redrum i Hammerfest!</h3>
<p>Det er bare en uke igjen til Cato Eriksen tar frem slegga og knuser Redrum. Inventaret legges ut for salg og scenen der vi alle har hatt store musikkopplevelser forsvinner fra byen. </p>
<p>Det er utrolig trist. Vi kan ikke la det skje. Vi trenger hjelp til å beholde Redrum. Vi trenger din hjelp til å få på plass egenkapital. </p>
<p>Hvis 400 personer betaler en tusenlapp hver har vi det vi trenger!</p>
<p>Det må vi klare å hoste opp sammen i oljebyen Hammerfest!</p>
<p><b>Hvis det ikke blir kjøp, får du tilbake pengene dine - minus noen prosenter som indiegogo tar.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Hvem er vi?</h3>
<div>Det begynte med at Caroline Greiner intervjuet Vibeke og Cato på Redrum til avisa. Da forstod hun at det neste helg er slutt for Redrum. Caroline er glad i musikk, festivaler, konserter og gode opplevelser. Derfor fikk hun panikk. </div>
<div>Hun har erfaring med å drive bedrift i Hammerfest. Hun startet og eier Gründersenteret Verk og lokalavisa Hammerfestingen sammen med Synnøve Aukan og Edel Maria Brynjulfsen. </div>
<div>Det er ikke Verk som firma som gjør dette, men vi gjør det i Verk sin ånd. Vi vil ha Redrum for å trives i Hammerfest. </div>
<div>Vi vil ha en levende by, med møteplasser og steder der vi alle får gode opplevelser.</div>
<div>Dette tiltaket er i vår lokalpatriotiske ånd. Det er en dyktig driver med på laget, men arbeidsituasjonen gjør at vi ikke går ut med navnet enda. </div>Hvordan eierkonstellasjonen blir er fortsatt i startgropa. <p>Nå må vi se om vi klarer å engasjere deg nok til at du bidrar med ditt. </p>
<p><b>Alle monner drar!</b></p>
<h3>Hva trenger vi og hva får du igjen?</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Vibeke og Cato selger Redrum for 1,6 millioner kroner. <br/>
</li>
<li>Banken finansierer ikke mer enn 50 prosent av kjøpesummen.<br/>
</li>
<li>Vi klarer å få opptil 400 000 fra annet hold, men trenger de siste 400 000  for å få kjøpe Redrum. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Det er nå eller aldri. </li>
<li>Bidra med det du kan og behold en av norges beste rockescener og byens beste utested.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Hva er Redrum for deg?</h3>
<p>Hva er Hammerfest uten Redrum. </p>
<p>Redrum er en kultur. Det er rockekonserter. Det er bolyst. Det er lærlingeplasser og arbeidsplasser. Det er kjærlighet og galskap. Det er musikk. Det er deg og meg. Det er rockn roll. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Redrum er mere enn en vanlig arbeidsplass. </p>
<p>Som Vibeke selv sier det:</p>
<p>Her har mange unge mennesker fått vokse opp, og lært mye om arbeidslivet. </p>
<p>Redrum har tatt imot mange elever fra barne, ungdom, og videregående skole. </p>
<p>De har fått lære viktigheten av arbeidsmoral, de har fått lære om kontrakter og arbeidsrutiner. </p>
<p>De har fått litt ""kjeft"" underveis, slik at de vet hvor grensen går for hvordan en opptrer i arbeidslivet. </p>
<p>De er blitt sett, de har fått trøst, de har møtt forståelse og de er blitt stor pris på av mæ &amp; Cato. </p>
<p>De er blitt fantastiske arbeidstakere, for framtidige arbeidsplasser. </p>
<p>Mange av de er ute å studerer, men de skal hjem til Hammerfest å jobbe &lt;3 </p>
<p>Vi er en egen redrum familie, hvor sorg og glede går hånd i hånd :) </p>
<p>Redrum er ikke en vanlig uteplass, hvor øl, vin og brennevin står i fokus. </p>
<p>-vi har opplevelsen som fokus!</p>
<p><b>Og alle skal ha det bra, de på jobb, gjester og artister. </b></p>
<p>-det har vi vel lykkes ganske godt med, sier Vibeke Nilsen,</p>
<br/><p></p>

Det begynte med at Caroline Greiner intervjuet Vibeke og Cato på Redrum til avisa. Da forstod hun at det neste helg er slutt for Redrum. Caroline er glad i musikk, festivaler, konserter og gode opplevelser. Derfor fikk hun panikk. 
Hun har erfaring med å drive bedrift i Hammerfest. Hun startet og eier Gründersenteret Verk og lokalavisa Hammerfestingen sammen med Synnøve Aukan og Edel Maria Brynjulfsen. 
Det er ikke Verk som firma som gjør dette, men vi gjør det i Verk sin ånd. Vi vil ha Redrum for å trives i Hammerfest. 
Vi vil ha en levende by, med møteplasser og steder der vi alle får gode opplevelser.
Dette tiltaket er i vår lokalpatriotiske ånd. Det er en dyktig driver med på laget, men arbeidsituasjonen gjør at vi ikke går ut med navnet enda. Hvordan eierkonstellasjonen blir er fortsatt i startgropa. Nå må vi se om vi klarer å engasjere deg nok til at du bidrar med ditt. 
Alle monner drar!
Hva trenger vi og hva får du igjen?


Vibeke og Cato selger Redrum for 1,6 millioner kroner. 

Banken finansierer ikke mer enn 50 prosent av kjøpesummen.

Vi klarer å få opptil 400 000 fra annet hold, men trenger de siste 400 000  for å få kjøpe Redrum. 




Det er nå eller aldri. 
Bidra med det du kan og behold en av norges beste rockescener og byens beste utested.




Hva er Redrum for deg?
Hva er Hammerfest uten Redrum. 
Redrum er en kultur. Det er rockekonserter. Det er bolyst. Det er lærlingeplasser og arbeidsplasser. Det er kjærlighet og galskap. Det er musikk. Det er deg og meg. Det er rockn roll. 

Redrum er mere enn en vanlig arbeidsplass. 
Som Vibeke selv sier det:
Her har mange unge mennesker fått vokse opp, og lært mye om arbeidslivet. 
Redrum har tatt imot mange elever fra barne, ungdom, og videregående skole. 
De har fått lære viktigheten av arbeidsmoral, de har fått lære om kontrakter og arbeidsrutiner. 
De har fått litt ""kjeft"" underveis, slik at de vet hvor grensen går for hvordan en opptrer i arbeidslivet. 
De er blitt sett, de har fått trøst, de har møtt forståelse og de er blitt stor pris på av mæ & Cato. 
De er blitt fantastiske arbeidstakere, for framtidige arbeidsplasser. 
Mange av de er ute å studerer, men de skal hjem til Hammerfest å jobbe <3 
Vi er en egen redrum familie, hvor sorg og glede går hånd i hånd :) 
Redrum er ikke en vanlig uteplass, hvor øl, vin og brennevin står i fokus. 
-vi har opplevelsen som fokus!
Og alle skal ha det bra, de på jobb, gjester og artister. 
-det har vi vel lykkes ganske godt med, sier Vibeke Nilsen,

<h2>Nashville Rescue Missions and The Next Door, helping women, children and men off the streets! </h2>
<p>My name is Ashley Martin, I am a singer songwriter from Ohio and Nashville. Six years ago I was living in Nashville attending Belmont University and working as a hostess at Big River Brewery (now Rock Bottom) by the Honky Tonks. My employer hired one homeless person per year to encourage and support them in getting back on their feet. Little did I know when I came into work that night my life would be changed forever! Wendy was hired as a new hostess that I was to train. As the night progressed she shared her story with me. I realized when our shift was over she had no place to go home to. I offered for her to stay with me! I was 19 at the time and needed help guiding her off past habits that I had no clue how to handle! So I went to the advisors at Belmont and they referred me to ""The Next Door"" for assistance.  They took Wendy in the very next day and gave her the support she needed! </p>
<p>Two years after I wrote a song about Wendy and it was chosen to be on my first E.P record that released this past February! <strong>We will release the</strong> <strong>""Wendy Baby"" music video the night of the event. I am SOOO EXCITED!!! </strong></p>

<li>I am a Disabled Marine Corps Veteran that became a Commercial and Film set photographer upon my return home but a humbling life experience has led me to live in the world of Photojournalism and Documentary work.</li>
<li>My campaign is one of art, culture and life in the city of New Orleans. In all aspects of life we must give back to the places and people who made us who we are. In essence, I owe a lot to the beautiful people and the amazing city of New Orleans. I've submitted my work for the last three years to be considered and didn't get selected but this time I've finally hit the mark!</li>
<li>My job is to capture and document the live performances by major international (eg, Eric Clapton &amp; Carlos Santana) and local artists (Honey Island Swamp Band &amp; The Treme' Brass Band) on and off stage as well as the life, culture, art and the patrons enjoying the festivities.</li>

I am a Disabled Marine Corps Veteran that became a Commercial and Film set photographer upon my return home but a humbling life experience has led me to live in the world of Photojournalism and Documentary work.
My campaign is one of art, culture and life in the city of New Orleans. In all aspects of life we must give back to the places and people who made us who we are. In essence, I owe a lot to the beautiful people and the amazing city of New Orleans. I've submitted my work for the last three years to be considered and didn't get selected but this time I've finally hit the mark!
My job is to capture and document the live performances by major international (eg, Eric Clapton & Carlos Santana) and local artists (Honey Island Swamp Band & The Treme' Brass Band) on and off stage as well as the life, culture, art and the patrons enjoying the festivities.
What I Need & What You Get
What I need is travel funding (Rental Car, Gas & Food from Atlanta to New Orleans and back (I've already secured lodging for the week that I will be there). In addition, I'll need two extra camera batteries, an extra battery charger and and four extra 8GB CF Memory cards. I've had everything properly planned yet an unforeseen family emergency has caused me to use the funds that I've saved. Although this would be one of, if not the biggest project in my career, above all else, family is most important. 
Here is the breakdown for expenses Rental Car - $350.00 (Standard size for a week), Fuel for the vehicle (Round trip is 982.2miles) along with fuel within the city (Roughly 55 gallons for a vehicle that uses 23-25 mpg @ $3.51 per = $193.05) Camera Batteries (2 @ $69.99 each) Battery Charger ( 1 @ $45.99), 8 GB Compact Flash memory cards (4 @ 29.99 each) and Meals for the week (a rate of $40.00 per day for seven days = $280.00).

<div>
<p>Hi!</p>
<h4>My name is Minami. I've been singing Jazz, Latin and Bossa Nova professionally in Japan and Berlin for many years and it has always been a dream of mine to make my own album. I want to produce my first album in the spring of 2015 with the best musicians and the best recording studio in Berlin, the city I have called home for over 3 years now. It's really important for me to make the best album I can because I want to donate a portion of the proceeds from sale of the album to animal rights groups in Japan. </h4>
<p><i>With your help, you can be part of getting my music out to the world, which in turn will allow me to do my small but important part to help improve the situation for animals in Japan.</i></p>

私のデビューアルバム制作のための支援者を募集します！！</b>

<h4>
このキャンペーンについて
</h4>
<p>ドイツ・ベルリンのレコーディングスタジオで一流ミュージシャンたちと自分のデビューアルバムを制作したい！<span><span>21歳の頃からジャズを歌い始めクラブやホテルでずっと歌って来ました。</span><span>いつかCDを作りたいと思ってはいたものの多額の費用の問題でスポンサーのいない自分には無理なんだとあきらめていました。</span>ドイツに拠点を移し音楽を続けているうちにさらなる目標を達成したいと思うようになりました。アルバムが作れたらレコード会社や音楽活動での有利なプロモーションができる。これから多くの人に自分を知ってもらうためにも今回のプロジェクトを成功させ皆さんに私のアルバムをお届けしたい！</span></p>
<h4>音楽とその先のゴール</h4>
<h4>
芸術家としての私の使命は自分のためだけの音楽ではなく、あらゆるところで「心の平和」を訴えゆく存在になることです。様々な社会問題がある中で特に日本の
ペット殺処分問題に大変心を痛めています。命を軽視する社会であってはいけない。自分の音楽や動物愛護活動を通して「命の尊さ」を人々に訴えてゆきたい。
芸術は自分を映し出す鏡です。平和な社会を望む自分にできる事は何か、その目的があるから音楽がさらに価値あるものになると思っています。
</h4>
<h4>
自分の愛する音楽が動物たちの命を救う事に繋がればこれほど嬉しい事はありません。そのためのお手伝いができるように今後の全てのCDの売り上げの15%
を日本の動物愛護団体に寄付する事。そして日本のペットが置かれている現状を海外の人も含めより多くの人たちに伝えて行く事がもう一つの私の目的でもあり
ます。
</h4>
<h4>
アルバムを作り今
回のプロジェクトを成功させる事が出来たら、私が愛する創造的な芸術と共に私の存在意義を感じることができます。尊い命の保護に貢献できる事は、私にとっ
てとても幸せなことです。皆さんと共に願う「命を尊ぶ社会の実現」に私がお役に立てるよう、ご支援いただけたら嬉しいです。

About this Campaign


Hi!
My name is Minami. I've been singing Jazz, Latin and Bossa Nova professionally in Japan and Berlin for many years and it has always been a dream of mine to make my own album. I want to produce my first album in the spring of 2015 with the best musicians and the best recording studio in Berlin, the city I have called home for over 3 years now. It's really important for me to make the best album I can because I want to donate a portion of the proceeds from sale of the album to animal rights groups in Japan. 
With your help, you can be part of getting my music out to the world, which in turn will allow me to do my small but important part to help improve the situation for animals in Japan.






What I Need ... What You Get





In order to make this album happen, with the help of my contributors I need to raise US$7000. The budget covers:


Studio fees (2 days of recording, plus mastering and mixing)
Musicians' fees (2 days of studio recording)
CD production (layout, design, pressing, etc)
Buying licensing and rights from GEMA

Taxes, transfer fees, etc.


In exchange for your contribution, no matter how big or small, you will not only receive my heartfelt thanks, but also something special and personal from me to show you how grateful I am that you are with me on this exciting project.

This campaign is ALL or NOTHING. I absolutely cannot make this album without your help, so if we don't reach the goal then the album doesn't get made and I don't receive any of the donations pledged (ie, you get your money back, your credit card won't be billed). So let's do this and go all the way!



(If we surpass our goal, then the money can go towards making the album EVEN BETTER - with more photos, more songs with even more excellent guest musicians, and if possible even a massive release party in one of Berlin's top jazz clubs!)
The album will be recorded at UFO Sound Studio in Berlin and will feature the best jazz musicians in the city:



UFO Sound Studio in Berlin



Other Ways You Can Help

 Even if you are not in a position to contribute any money to fund this album, you can still help this dream album become a reality. 
Please help spread the word by sharing this campaign via Facebook, Twitter, email, or even through word of mouth to anyone you know who might be interested in becoming part of this exciting project which has been a dream of mine for many years.
Thank you!
xoxo
Minami

私のデビューアルバム制作のための支援者を募集します！！


このキャンペーンについて

ドイツ・ベルリンのレコーディングスタジオで一流ミュージシャンたちと自分のデビューアルバムを制作したい！21歳の頃からジャズを歌い始めクラブやホテルでずっと歌って来ました。いつかCDを作りたいと思ってはいたものの多額の費用の問題でスポンサーのいない自分には無理なんだとあきらめていました。ドイツに拠点を移し音楽を続けているうちにさらなる目標を達成したいと思うようになりました。アルバムが作れたらレコード会社や音楽活動での有利なプロモーションができる。これから多くの人に自分を知ってもらうためにも今回のプロジェクトを成功させ皆さんに私のアルバムをお届けしたい！
音楽とその先のゴール

芸術家としての私の使命は自分のためだけの音楽ではなく、あらゆるところで「心の平和」を訴えゆく存在になることです。様々な社会問題がある中で特に日本の
ペット殺処分問題に大変心を痛めています。命を軽視する社会であってはいけない。自分の音楽や動物愛護活動を通して「命の尊さ」を人々に訴えてゆきたい。
芸術は自分を映し出す鏡です。平和な社会を望む自分にできる事は何か、その目的があるから音楽がさらに価値あるものになると思っています。


自分の愛する音楽が動物たちの命を救う事に繋がればこれほど嬉しい事はありません。そのためのお手伝いができるように今後の全てのCDの売り上げの15%
を日本の動物愛護団体に寄付する事。そして日本のペットが置かれている現状を海外の人も含めより多くの人たちに伝えて行く事がもう一つの私の目的でもあり
ます。


アルバムを作り今
回のプロジェクトを成功させる事が出来たら、私が愛する創造的な芸術と共に私の存在意義を感じることができます。尊い命の保護に貢献できる事は、私にとっ
てとても幸せなことです。皆さんと共に願う「命を尊ぶ社会の実現」に私がお役に立てるよう、ご支援いただけたら嬉しいです。



私たちに必要なこと


アルバムを作る為のCD制作には実際にたくさんの費用がかかります。

スタジオ代 (レコーディング2日間＋マスタリング、ミキシング)
ミュージシャン出演料(2日間)
CD 製造 (プレス, レイアウト, デザイン, etc)

著作権, 権利


税金, 送料, etc　
合計　7,000ドルの金額を調達しなければなりません

＊アルバムのレコーディングは来年の春までに済ませ晩春には完成させる予定です

こ
のクラウドファンディングキャンペーンの目的は支援してくださる人たちと一緒にこのプロジェクトを成功させる事です。しかしながら期限内(40日間)に目
標金額に到達しなかった場合、プロジェクトは不成立となり資金調達は実施されません。その場合は支援者からの寄付金はリターンされ私からの特典を提供する

Additional costs: Finnish taxes (& Indiegogo platform fee  5% + credit card fee 3%) 250.000 €

(The future campaigns will be planned and scheduled according to the result of this first campaign).5000 funders x 50 € = 250.000 € IDEAL GOAL!!!

<h3>Help Us Record a New Album</h3>
<p>We are excited to be heading into the studio to record our fourth
full-length! We’ve been crafting our tunes over the past year and have studio
time booked with <a href=""http://www.jessegander.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Gander</a>
starting in May.</p>
<p>Our new material draws on our tradition of DIY ethics, critical anthems and
pulling the punk rock community together. It’s the culmination of all the
things we’ve learned, good or bad through the last 4 releases. It will also feature
a guest appearance by local folk hero and our friend <a href=""http://jeffandrew.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Andrew</a> with his violin.</p>
<p>What we don’t have unfortunately, is the means to pay for it.</p>
<p>We are turning to our friends, fans and such. Will you help us out?</p>
<p>We are independent. We have no funding from labels or corporate sponsors
(haha yeah right). We don’t make a profit here at Rebel Spell Incorporated; we
do this because we love it. The songs we’ve been building have this new album
poised to be our best work yet and with enough funding the icing on the whole
thing will be the talent and experience of one of canada’s best punk
engineer/producers. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/506402/files/20140413215948-rehearsin.jpg?1397451588"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<h3>Production Budget</h3>
<p>Our rough budget for this production is as

<p><span>·<span>

<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Vinyl Pressing $3000 </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>CD Pressing $2500</p>
<p>That should run us about $14,200 or so. We
are hoping to raise $10,000 with this campaign, and cover the rest through a
fundraiser tour and album sales after-the-fact. If the campaign falls short of
this, you will still get your perk, no worries there. We still receive funding. Every little bit counts!<br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We know you don't have to pay these days to get music and we are extremely
grateful to those of you who have helped us over the years, for everything from
buying a cd or download to giving us a patch of carpet to sleep on. </p>
<p>We have a list of perks that come with your
donation. Want something from us that you don’t see? Send us a message and
we’ll try to hook you up with whatever cool thing your heart desires.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>And if you can’t contribute and money right now, we understand. You could
still give us a hand by posting this to your social media and letting people
know.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I've played music and sang for as long as I can remember. Growing up in a home surrounded by a family of musicians, it just made sense. I can't remember a family gathering where we didn't at some point pick up an instrument and begin singing and playing our favorite hymns or worship songs. Although I've been involved with music my whole life, I was never able to write songs. I was never motivated by stories of break ups, long lost lovers, and romance. It wasn't until I fully surrendered my life, including my talents and abilities, to Christ that I was filled with a song. </span><br/></p><p>Over the past year, I've been writing about what matters the most to me. I truly believe that within the Christian music genre we need more songs that are transparent and honest. Our music not only needs to be relatable on the good days, but the bad days as well. These songs were inspired by my community, and are about real struggles, faith, doubt, sin, and most importantly, they're about a passionate pursuit between <b>creation</b> and <b>the Creator</b>. This is why I've decided to call the title of my record, <b><i>Chasing</i>.</b> We are all chasing something, but the good news is, God is personally inviting each of us to chase after Him. </p><p>I will be recording this album with my very talented friend, Keith Harris. We will be recording in Nashville, Tennessee as well as St. Louis, Missouri, in late October with the hopes of releasing the record to the public in late November. </p><p><b>THE CAMPAIGN </b></p><p>You may be asking yourself, ""Okay, but what does this have to do with me?"" It has <b>EVERYTHING</b> to do with you! This record cannot happen without your help. To record an album, there are many expenses (all of which are included in the $6,000 goal) such as paying the engineer, mixing and producing fees, ordering physical copies of the CD, creating album artwork, paying musicians, and much more. I've chosen to do a ""Flexible Campaign,"" which means that if <i>I don't reach my goal, </i>I will still receive all your donations. Not reaching my goal simply means that I will either be able to record less songs, or will have to wait until I save more money to record. Without the help of my community,<i> I will not be able to make this record</i>.

Growing up in a home surrounded by a family of musicians, it just made sense. I can't remember a family gathering where we didn't at some point pick up an instrument and begin singing and playing our favorite hymns or worship songs. Although I've been involved with music my whole life, I was never able to write songs. I was never motivated by stories of break ups, long lost lovers, and romance. It wasn't until I fully surrendered my life, including my talents and abilities, to Christ that I was filled with a song. Over the past year, I've been writing about what matters the most to me. I truly believe that within the Christian music genre we need more songs that are transparent and honest. Our music not only needs to be relatable on the good days, but the bad days as well. These songs were inspired by my community, and are about real struggles, faith, doubt, sin, and most importantly, they're about a passionate pursuit between creation and the Creator. This is why I've decided to call the title of my record, Chasing. We are all chasing something, but the good news is, God is personally inviting each of us to chase after Him. I will be recording this album with my very talented friend, Keith Harris. We will be recording in Nashville, Tennessee as well as St. Louis, Missouri, in late October with the hopes of releasing the record to the public in late November. THE CAMPAIGN You may be asking yourself, ""Okay, but what does this have to do with me?"" It has EVERYTHING to do with you! This record cannot happen without your help. To record an album, there are many expenses (all of which are included in the $6,000 goal) such as paying the engineer, mixing and producing fees, ordering physical copies of the CD, creating album artwork, paying musicians, and much more. I've chosen to do a ""Flexible Campaign,"" which means that if I don't reach my goal, I will still receive all your donations. Not reaching my goal simply means that I will either be able to record less songs, or will have to wait until I save more money to record. Without the help of my community, I will not be able to make this record. It's up to YOU to help me make this dream a reality! To give to my campaign, all you need to do is hit the ""Contribute Now"" button and you will be guided through the giving process. But it doesn't end there! Based on the amount of support you give, you will also receive perks!

project called <b>Old table</b>. Because of cosmic good fortune I’ve been blessed with
a supportive family and community of friends that have allowed me to play many,
many shows, and make a generous number of self-released albums, mostly under the
“<b>Intellectual Bird Records</b>” (or IBR) label. </p>

Hello my name is Will, for over ten years I have had this punk rock band / recording

Musicianship of Utmost Quality


Old table started as a one man recording project and

""Excuse Maaay!""


At this point in the (anti-)career of the band, I feel it’s
time to attempt to confront the world of “musical business”. To try to present
a product and a package that is confident about it’s own existence and with
what it’s image projects. This record wants to naively:

We were founded 14 years ago by Gospel Music Hall of Fame inductee and long time Blackwood Brothers member, Rick Price. Performing some 240 times a year, the quartet currently thrives as a living tribute to the original Blackwood Brothers while remaining focused on the contemporary edge of Southern Gospel music. Rick has assembled a vocal supergroup that tours with him full time. Luke Yates, Paul Secord, and Hunter Sparkman help insure the tradition of Gospel music is upheld with tight harmonies, soaring melodies, and inspiring vocal arrangements.

Craig is a veteran Hollywood director with credits like Michael Jackson's Victory Tour, NBC's Must See TV campaign, and The Wonder Years. He was even head of Lucasfilm's LA division and operated LA's first music video studio! We can only call it divine intervention that our paths crossed...and that he was inspired by our song.

The impact of this project will be dynamic and far reaching. We can bring much needed attention to our vets and help America recognize the honor that our defenders of freedom deserve, all the while growing the audience for our style of vocally driven Gospel music. ""I'll Stand"" will anchor a full concert lineup of both traditional and original favorites that you will know and love. The DVD will also include interviews and behind the scenes footage of the event. Our audiences have asked for something like this for years, but the pieces have never come together like they are right now. For God and country, it's time to take a Stand and we need you to be a part of it.</p><p>The estimated final cost of the completed ""I'll Stand"" Concert DVD project is $22, 450.

The venue is provided nearly free of cost and we also have a team of volunteers contributing to the effort on concert night. The final product of this kind of setup will stand the test of time and continue to be relevant and look great many years down the road. We've called in a bevy of favors to reduce production cost and have managed to cut it nearly in half from the original $40K!</p><p>In return for your generous contributions we offer some exciting gifts, from first run and autographed CDs/DVDs to personal video messages with Blackwood Legacy singing your favorite song, Dinner with the quartet, and even Executive Producer credit right on the DVD cover!!!</p><p>If we're not able to raise the total $22,450, we will carry on with the project in ernest, while shrinking the scale to match our budget.

I will send out CD's to anyone who has ordered them by Dec. 14  even if the campaign isn't over. This is safely within the deadline UPS and USPS for a Christmas delivery, if that is important to you.</div><div>
<h3>What I'm Offering</h3>I am offering the traditional option of buying one CD, but I also am offering the ability to buy a stack of these CD's at a greatly reduced price to give as holiday gifts. </div><div>Or really any kind of gift. </div><div>Sharing indie and affordable music with friends, family, co-workers and neighbors is the goal!<br/>
</div><div>With the help of photographer Jessica Greaux and the multi-talented visual artist Lindsay Elgin, I have designed an 11x17 poster that contains all the album lyrics, and can be folded up into a neat booklet. </div><div>If I don't reach my entire fundraising goal, don't worry. You will still get your CD in the mail just the same. I will just absorb the additional cost myself.<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Please be an Early Bird! </h3> <p>If you are one of my early supporters in this campaign, please choose the early bird offers as these are where I've given the best discount on my offers. <b><i>I really really want you to have an affordable way to have a stack of my CD's to give away as gifts.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b></p>
<h3>Night Owl? No problem!</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Never fear. My later supporters will still have reduced price perks available to them as well. </span></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Why I'm so excited to share this project with my community</h3>I love writing music, arranging it and recording it in a studio. I love challenging myself to write jazz influenced harmonies on the guitar that still fit into the genre of folk and pop acoustic music.  
<p>And one of the magical parts about studio recording is you have the ability to write and record richly layered vocal harmonies to fill out a song.  So I'm very excited to share these arrangements with you. </p>
<p>Also, on this album I got to work with a bunch of amazing artists. David Peters is a highly sought after engineer and producer based out of LA, and this is my second project with him. Since he is also songwriter himself, his style of working in the studio is powerful and one of a kind.</p>
<p>I also go to work with Jimmy Paxson on drums  (currently playing with Ben Harper), Mike Valerio (LA Philharmonic and a huge list of movie and TV scores), and Julie Wolf on keys (who is the songwriter's favorite pianist, most recently with Carly Simon), as well as a handful of other great musicians.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <br/><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The album has already been recorded, mixed, mastered and designed. </p>
<p>So at this stage of the game the risks are pretty minimal. </p>
<p>However, I suppose it is <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">possible </i>that a huge nor'easter will dump 5 feet of snow on the CD factory in New Jersey and delay the CD's being printed. And, while the goal is to have CD's in your hands by 12/25, if either the CD factory or the US Postal Service is delayed then you might get your shipment a few days late. </p>
<p>I don't see these as being major risks. But if you are counting on these arriving by 12/25, it is possible they'll be a few days late.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Whether you back this campaign or not, please share this with your friends who enjoy acoustic singer-songwriter music. </p>
<p>There are sharing tools on this website you can use. Or you can send them an old fashioned email with a link to this site. Or tell your friend at work. Or that neighbor you run into while you're walking your dog. You get the drift... Your help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Not sure who might like my music? I have been told that people who like my music tend to also like the music of Jonatha Brooke, Dar Williams, Kathleen Edwards, K'eb Mo, India Arie, Ani DiFranco, Kris Delmhorst, Peter Mulvey, and/or Erin McKeown.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Won't be Streaming</h3>
<p>Nope. Spotify, pandora or iTunes will not have this album for the foreseeable future.  Just good ol' fashioned CDs! (Ok, they're not that old fashioned. But you get my point.)</p>

What I'm OfferingI am offering the traditional option of buying one CD, but I also am offering the ability to buy a stack of these CD's at a greatly reduced price to give as holiday gifts. Or really any kind of gift. Sharing indie and affordable music with friends, family, co-workers and neighbors is the goal!
With the help of photographer Jessica Greaux and the multi-talented visual artist Lindsay Elgin, I have designed an 11x17 poster that contains all the album lyrics, and can be folded up into a neat booklet. If I don't reach my entire fundraising goal, don't worry. You will still get your CD in the mail just the same. I will just absorb the additional cost myself.    
Please be an Early Bird!  If you are one of my early supporters in this campaign, please choose the early bird offers as these are where I've given the best discount on my offers. I really really want you to have an affordable way to have a stack of my CD's to give away as gifts.

Night Owl? No problem!
Never fear. My later supporters will still have reduced price perks available to them as well. 

Why I'm so excited to share this project with my communityI love writing music, arranging it and recording it in a studio. I love challenging myself to write jazz influenced harmonies on the guitar that still fit into the genre of folk and pop acoustic music.  
And one of the magical parts about studio recording is you have the ability to write and record richly layered vocal harmonies to fill out a song.  So I'm very excited to share these arrangements with you. 
Also, on this album I got to work with a bunch of amazing artists. David Peters is a highly sought after engineer and producer based out of LA, and this is my second project with him. Since he is also songwriter himself, his style of working in the studio is powerful and one of a kind.
I also go to work with Jimmy Paxson on drums  (currently playing with Ben Harper), Mike Valerio (LA Philharmonic and a huge list of movie and TV scores), and Julie Wolf on keys (who is the songwriter's favorite pianist, most recently with Carly Simon), as well as a handful of other great musicians.
    Risks & Challenges The album has already been recorded, mixed, mastered and designed. 
So at this stage of the game the risks are pretty minimal. 
However, I suppose it is possible that a huge nor'easter will dump 5 feet of snow on the CD factory in New Jersey and delay the CD's being printed. And, while the goal is to have CD's in your hands by 12/25, if either the CD factory or the US Postal Service is delayed then you might get your shipment a few days late. 
I don't see these as being major risks. But if you are counting on these arriving by 12/25, it is possible they'll be a few days late.
    Other Ways You Can Help Whether you back this campaign or not, please share this with your friends who enjoy acoustic singer-songwriter music. 
There are sharing tools on this website you can use. Or you can send them an old fashioned email with a link to this site. Or tell your friend at work. Or that neighbor you run into while you're walking your dog. You get the drift... Your help is greatly appreciated!
Not sure who might like my music? I have been told that people who like my music tend to also like the music of Jonatha Brooke, Dar Williams, Kathleen Edwards, K'eb Mo, India Arie, Ani DiFranco, Kris Delmhorst, Peter Mulvey, and/or Erin McKeown.

Won't be Streaming
Nope. Spotify, pandora or iTunes will not have this album for the foreseeable future.  Just good ol' fashioned CDs! (Ok, they're not that old fashioned. But you get my point.)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span>Paper Waves is a project based on collaboration in songwriting, support, leadership, and goofy shenanigans. Our talented, all-female lineup, consisting of Bridget Duggan, Christiana Usenza, Lorie Lin, Gabrielle Otto, and Jane Carter, is well-versed in a variety of instruments and musical backgrounds, with a diverse instrumentation that includes guitar, cello, ukulele, keys, drum set, vox, and the cajon! As trained musicians since youth, we have all been playing music either professionally or for fun for most of our lives, but it wasn’t until Paper Waves that we discovered our passion and excitement for writing and collaboration. The group inspires us to push our preconceived limits and hone our musicianship through songwriting, practicing and performing. </span></p>
<p><span>Our dynamic, fun and energizing chemistry has resulted in the creation of an abundance of many new tunes, varying in style, from sexy and humorous (“Tiger Song”), to heartfelt (“The Night”), good ol’ bluesy (“Play It Cool”), to sweet folk (“The Space”), upbeat rock (“White Flag,” “Fire Inside”), and melancholic pop (“Seas Apart”). These songs are slated for our debut album, and hopefully with a little help from you, we'll be able to make this project a reality!</span></p>

<p>For the past year and a half we have been feverishly working on recording and releasing an EP and launching our new band, Daughter &amp; Son. It has been a long and careful process trying to make it happen, and we made sure to put the time and hard work into doing it right.  Thankfully, the time has come to share Daughter &amp; Son with all of you!</p>
<p>On March 26<sup>th</sup> our self titled EP was born into this world and, just like any baby, we want to take good care of it so it can grow up to be big and strong. Pledging to our campaign will help us create a loving home, supportive family and a nurturing environment for it to learn how to stand and walk on it’s own two legs. Since we have no record label or independent funding behind us, we plan on taking do-it-yourself to a whole new level, and we need your help!</p>
<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS:</strong></p>
<p>You pick from one of the 11 amazing perks we have offered on this page. The monetary amount from that perk is donated to our campaign. At the end of the campaign, we send you everything promised in the perk you chose. Its that simple!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOUR MONEY WILL BE USED FOR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Press and Marketing</strong> – How often is it that you are reading your favorite paper, magazine or blog, and a picture or headline jumps off the page and catches your eye? Have you ever discovered a new band from reading the latest buzz or from checking out a new video or song they just released? These artists arrive at your fingertips because they have people who work hard to get them there. And as in any business, the better the person is at the job, the more you have to pay them. The majority of your pledges will be used to hire a heavy hitting Press Representative to get Daughter &amp; Son known, seen and heard, where it counts.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Touring</strong> – The most important piece of the puzzle for any band is performing and gaining new fans through playing shows in cities and regions outside of where they are based. We want to come and perform in a town near you! However, touring costs are high with travel expenses, lodging and the cost of living while on the road. Another portion of the money you donate will help us cover these costs so we can meet and play for all of you in the very near future. Please let us know in what cities you’d like to see us play!</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Promotional Materials</strong> – The best way to discover anything new is word of mouth. Since we are a brand new band, we need to get our music and name out there to as many people as we can. This means we will need fun things to sell. From stickers to posters to t-shirts to tote bags to underwear to you name it – we want to get it out and into your hands. Let us know what type of merchandise you’d like us to make so we can decorate you in D&amp;S style.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>EP Production Costs</strong> – Even though our EP is finished and we were able to make it without spending too much money, it did cost us quite a bit to have the actual EP’s reproduced so you can get your own copy through CD Baby shipped into your very own hands. Part of the money you donate will be used to pay off these expenses and also to help us begin recording our next EP, Daughter &amp; Son – Volume 2, which we hope to have out by Fall, 2013. </li>
</ul><p>During this campaign we will be keeping you updated about the tours we’re planning, the songs we’re writing and recording, and we’ll also send you treats and free gifts the more you help us spread the word to your family and friends to help us reach our goal. We want to hear from you and so we can share our exciting journey with you every step of the way. Thank you so much!</p></div>","WE HAVE RECENTLY LAUNCHED OUR NEW EP!!

EP Production Costs – Even though our EP is finished and we were able to make it without spending too much money, it did cost us quite a bit to have the actual EP’s reproduced so you can get your own copy through CD Baby shipped into your very own hands. Part of the money you donate will be used to pay off these expenses and also to help us begin recording our next EP, Daughter & Son – Volume 2, which we hope to have out by Fall, 2013. 
During this campaign we will be keeping you updated about the tours we’re planning, the songs we’re writing and recording, and we’ll also send you treats and free gifts the more you help us spread the word to your family and friends to help us reach our goal. We want to hear from you and so we can share our exciting journey with you every step of the way. Thank you so much!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>          A little about me and this venture…</h3>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class=""WordSection1"">
<div>
<p>Writing songs for me has always been a way to work through and process emotions.  To me, music is medicine for the soul. It has healed me from pain and allowed me to feel in a way that other things just can't tap. It is a true universal language. No matter what race, creed, skin color, or societal status you are, when you hear music, you feel. Music over time has proved to be the one unifying element we have as a human race and world community. It can inspire, uplift, and penetrate people to ignite their light and life force. It cuts through all things, and with the right intention can create a profound and positive ripple in the world so we can together work towards prosperity, abundant growth, and well being for all.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>My journey continues with the completion of this album in the hope of inspiring, uplifting, and healing the planet.  I want to create something people will be able to listen to, find some respite, and be moved as a whole.</p>

This opportunity represents the single most important chance for us to turn on new fans from around the world and catapult our music onto the world stage. Unfortunately, driving from Seattle to New Orleans while performing in a dozen or more new places faces us with some very considerable expenses and risks. We plan on taking two and a half weeks to tour down to New Orleans and about ten days to play in a variety of situations in the Crescent City and surrounding area. This will be the first time the band has ever performed in the South, and because of this our connections in the area are very limited. We need to ask you for help in covering the expenses of this trip to help make this dream become a reality.  The Good News:The tour is booked, we bought a van to take us on our journey, (and many more to come) and the band members are willing to take the considerable financial risks that come from going out on a  long tour. We have locked down some very special shows in NOLA that will have us performing for hundreds (perhaps thousands!) of new fans, music industry insiders, and talent buyers from all over the world.The Bad News:We will not be making enough money from our performances on this tour to even scratch the surface of the expenses that we will incur, let alone pay the pro-talent musicians who make up the Polyrhythmics. To bridge this gap, we find need to pursue independent fund raising to make this dream come true and thats where we need you.What the Money is Used for:Expenses:
$2,500 in gas Seattle to New Orleans, LA and back again.
$2,000 in cheap motels for nights when where our connections for lodging run dry.
$4,000 for food. We travel with three 6 foot+ dudes, it gets quite pricey.
$600 for an oil change for ""Jessica"", our 12 passenger Sprinter van.
$1,000 to hire outside help in cities where we know no one to get us in newspapers, on radio, and to have flyers hung prior to our arrival.
We are calling on our fans, friends, family members and generous strangers to donate whatever they can to help Polyrhythmics make this trip to New Orleans as successful as possible. Every donation through Indie Go Go goes directly to the band, so you can be certain it will be safely and honestly used for the purpose of this tour. While we are trying to cover our enormous expenses of $10,000-- essentially asking you to donate generously, we do have some unique perks to give back in thanks, from a handmade Shekere by our percussion player Lalo, to hard to book private lessons with members of the band, we think you will find something that can make any donation a little more special.Polyrhythmics has long known we are apart of the most unique, generous and savvy circle of music fans in the world, and from our soul to yours, Thank You!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Her Story</h3>
<p>Brooklyn Mecca and Oyasound are the creative projects of Dj Sabine. Dj Sabine's events focuses on the exposure and pleasures of African Diasporic music. Oyasound music production label and Ep is currently in the works. Dj Sabine's mainstay and cultivation has been the monthly event Brooklyn Mecca which has been coined the home of ""Grassroots Dance Culture"". Dj Sabine spins Global Soul: House, Afrotech, Afrobeat, Haitian Roots and other diasporic tunes. Her main influences are her spirit guides, ancestors, and warrior women. Her ear for music soothes the innate part of herself and others that honors the sounds of drums, the power of words, and the healing affect of conjuring up pure positive feeling and emotion. She has had the great opportunity to spin nationally in the US in NYC, Atlanta, St. Louis, Memphis, Chicago, Omaha, Boston, Miami, LA/Oakland, NJ, Washington DC, Dallas, Denver and internationally in Montreal and Cancun. <br/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dj Sabine's goal is to visit a new continent each year. This year it's Europe! 
She will share her interpretation of house &amp; electronic music and 
gain inspiration from the sights &amp; sounds of various countries. The intention is to globally connect with djs/producers, club owners/promoters, and dancers to create future Oyasound projects such as Eps, music workshops/conferences, and performances/events. Essentially, expanding the Global Soul sound and house music community. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What She Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All it takes is 250 people to donate $20 each to reach her $5000 goal! This will cover airfare, transportation, lodging, meals, dj/promotional items. $50 or more will get you an exclusive Dj Sabine mix. $150 or more will get you an exclusive Dj Sabine mix &amp; Brooklyn Mecca/Oyasound t-shirt. Any contribution is greatly appreciated and will certainly help Dj Sabine reach her Europe goal by the fall of this year! <br/></p>

</div></div>","Her Story
Brooklyn Mecca and Oyasound are the creative projects of Dj Sabine. Dj Sabine's events focuses on the exposure and pleasures of African Diasporic music. Oyasound music production label and Ep is currently in the works. Dj Sabine's mainstay and cultivation has been the monthly event Brooklyn Mecca which has been coined the home of ""Grassroots Dance Culture"". Dj Sabine spins Global Soul: House, Afrotech, Afrobeat, Haitian Roots and other diasporic tunes. Her main influences are her spirit guides, ancestors, and warrior women. Her ear for music soothes the innate part of herself and others that honors the sounds of drums, the power of words, and the healing affect of conjuring up pure positive feeling and emotion. She has had the great opportunity to spin nationally in the US in NYC, Atlanta, St. Louis, Memphis, Chicago, Omaha, Boston, Miami, LA/Oakland, NJ, Washington DC, Dallas, Denver and internationally in Montreal and Cancun. 


The Impact
Dj Sabine's goal is to visit a new continent each year. This year it's Europe! 
She will share her interpretation of house & electronic music and 
gain inspiration from the sights & sounds of various countries. The intention is to globally connect with djs/producers, club owners/promoters, and dancers to create future Oyasound projects such as Eps, music workshops/conferences, and performances/events. Essentially, expanding the Global Soul sound and house music community. 


What She Needs & What You Get
All it takes is 250 people to donate $20 each to reach her $5000 goal! This will cover airfare, transportation, lodging, meals, dj/promotional items. $50 or more will get you an exclusive Dj Sabine mix. $150 or more will get you an exclusive Dj Sabine mix & Brooklyn Mecca/Oyasound t-shirt. Any contribution is greatly appreciated and will certainly help Dj Sabine reach her Europe goal by the fall of this year!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">	We are Diego's Umbrella--
an independent, San Francisco-based Gypsy Rock band that has been
building a group of fiercely devoted fans since 2005.  With 3
self-produced albums under our belt, and no distribution from any
label, we take our music to the people the old fashioned way:
relentless touring.  And that suits us just fine, because we love to
play live. 
</p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">	Our touring came to an
abrupt halt in November, when our van, which we lovingly called, “The
Plumber,” hit a patch of black-ice on the way home from a show in
Tahoe.  The van, with trailer attached, did a 180 across traffic and
ended up in a ditch.  We were all shaken, but thankfully no one was
badly hurt.  Sadly, the same could not be said for The Plumber.  Our
trusty van, which had become a home to us all, was totaled.  
</p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">	We haven't let it stop us,
but the months since the accident have been challenging for us. 
We've had to travel to shows by caravaning in smaller cars, which has
been extremely expensive in terms of gas, and stressful because not
all of our cars are completely reliable.  It also doesn't sit well
with us to know that the caravan has increased the size of our
eco-footprint.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Which brings us to our request: help us get back out on the road with a reliable van and trailer, so we can get back to doing what we do best.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The best thing about being is Diego's Umbrella is that, every night, we get a chance to make people happy.  By the time we've hit our final song, we, and our audiences, usually end up an exhausted, ecstatic, beautiful mess.  It's an experience and an audience unlike any of us have ever had in other bands; we truly give our fans everything we've got and they give it right back.  We toured for nearly half of 2010, and our plan for 2011 was to take the touring even further; we are working on our first extended East-Coast tour in the Summer, and have even been batting around some Southern US dates.  Without a reliable vehicle for us to tour in, our plans and progress will definitely be slowed, and some touring may even have to be canceled.  And that is a genuinely heartbreaking thought for us.   <br/></p>
<p>  <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So that brings us to our specific goals, and how you can help!  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are aiming for $12,000 total, which will be divided between $10,000 for a new van, and $2,000 for a trailer.  We will be looking for the best possible used van for the money, hopefully no older than 2002.  And the trailer will be a wonderful thing for us, because up to now we have always rented, which has been wasteful considering how much time we spend on the road.</p>

<p>I love music.</p>
<p>I grew up on AOR radio.  AOR stands for Album Oriented Rock, and that meant the station played more than just the hits. I discovered tons of terrific singers and bands thanks to those stations.</p>
<p>For example, back in 1984 (and into 1985), Bruce Springsteen’s “Born In The USA” album spawned seven singles.  Every one of those was a top ten hit.  My favorite songs off that album aren’t any of those seven, though.  They are “No Surrender”, “Bobby Jean” and “Workin’ On The Highway”.<br/><br/> I owned the record, of course.  Since it went 15 times platinum (platinum is a million sales), there’s a chance you did, too (or at least, someone you know owned it).  But I grew to really love those three songs from hearing them on the radio.</p>
<p>I still really like them, though I couldn’t even begin to guess when a radio station played them last.  For that matter, you don’t really hear those seven hit singles any more, either, at least not most of them.  “I’m On Fire” is suddenly getting a lot of airplay on a station here, so there’s a pretty good chance that a station near you is playing it all of a sudden, too.<br/><br/> A lot of stations these days “test” the music they play.  They do tests over the phone or in auditoriums, with a couple hundred people who fit the demo of their station.  This isn’t just a 2013 phenomenon; it’s been going on for years and years.  That’s why you can travel from town to town and coast to coast, and find stations that play almost the exact same music.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t apply to every single station in America.  But it applies to a lot of them.  Too many.  They become afraid of playing a song that doesn’t test well, or they go the other way and get very excited about a song that does test well.  That’s how a song that you haven’t heard on the radio in thirty years can suddenly pop up often, even daily.  And that’s also why there’s a good chance that your favorite station has slipped “I’m On Fire” back into rotation.</p>
<p>Aside from all the music testing, there’s the multi-tasking issue.  In a lot of stations, the program director and the music director don’t just work for one station. They run several, what the corporations like to call a “cluster”.  So the guy programming your local rock station may also have similar tasks at their sister station, which is country, or adult contemporary.  Or all three.  Or even more.</p>
<p>I like lots of different kinds of music, but I don’t have a real passion for all of them.  And because of that, I don’t really know a lot about them.  So if I suddenly had to program a country station, I’d be in trouble.  Unless someone told me what I should be playing.</p>
<p>Someone who was also telling other country stations what they should play.  Or other adult contemporary stations.  Et cetera.</p>
<p>The other thing is that, for those stations whose employees do care about the music, the same protocols are in place.  Here’s a list of what your station is going to play.</p>
<p>I get that radio stations aren’t jukeboxes, but having someone who doesn’t care about the music deciding what music gets played, based on testing (and other nebulous factors) might give you a good idea about why stations sound the way they do.</p>
<p>That's why, to keep with Bruce Springsteen as an example, the majority of his music, going all the way back to 1973’s “Greetings From Asbury Park NJ”, gets ignored.  In fact, you’re more likely to hear Manfred Mann’s version of “Blinded By The Light” than Springsteen’s original version (because it tested well).<br/><br/> And other than a couple tracks off his Greatest Hits collection, you’re not likely to hear much from one of the hardest working guys in the history of rock.</p>
<p>Of course, Bruce isn't alone.<br/><br/> U2 got some decent airplay with 2001’s “All That You Can’t Leave Behind”, but twelve years later, there are only a handful of their songs that you still hear on the radio.  And most, if not all, of that can be found on their singles’ collection from 2006.  You just aren’t likely to hear anything more than the usual suspects from them.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Beatles.</p>
<p>John, Paul, George and Ringo had a lot of great songs, together and on their own.  In 2000, thirty years after they broke up, Capital Records released an album simply called “1”, which was a collection of their number one songs.  This went on to become the fastest-selling record in history.<br/><br/> If you’re lucky enough to have a station that still plays the Beatles, you’re lucky if you hear anything besides the songs on this album.</p>
<p>And as far as the solo stuff goes, some stations still play John’s “Imagine” and George’s “My Sweet Lord”.  You’ll probably get “Band On The Run” and “Live And Let Die” from Paul.  And your oldies station might throw on Ringo’s “Photograph” once in a great while.</p>
<p>It seems like a crime to me that all this music is getting lost.  And that radio has become such a wasteland that the people running it just seem to have absolutely no musical soul.</p>
<p>I used three easy examples here (Bruce, U2 and the Beatles) but there are so many more (and it’s growing every day).</p>
<p>And there are plenty of these artists who had terrific albums back then (whenever their “back then” was), and are still making music today!</p>
<p>Here’s a small sample of artists that have put out new stuff in just the last few months:</p>
<p>David Bowie<br/> Bon Jovi<br/> Eric Clapton<br/> New Order<br/> Adam Ant<br/> They Might Be Giants<br/> Depeche Mode<br/> Big Country<br/> Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark<br/> Deep Purple<br/> Justin Hayward<br/> Poco<br/> The Proclaimers<br/> Todd Rundgren<br/> Southside Johnny<br/> Counting Crows<br/><br/> Also out this year, updated albums, remastered with bonus and/or live tracks from Huey Lewis, Fleetwood Mac, the Tubes, REM and the Allman Brothers!<br/><br/> And, previously unreleased live sets from ZZ Top, Head East, Rainbow and Crosby Stills Nash and Young!<br/><br/> Plus, new music coming from the Goo Goo Dolls in May and the Kinks’ Dave Davies in June!<br/><br/> And don’t forget that they finally put out a whole album full of previously unreleased music from Jimi Hendrix!</p>
<p>I don’t mean to suggest all these are equal.  While I still like “The Heart of the Night”, a new album from Poco doesn’t equal a new album from U2 (no offense intended to fans of either band).</p>
<p>I guess the thing is, I just get tired of turning on the radio in my car and hearing a lot of the same old, same old.  I can almost guarantee you that I will hear a Pink Floyd song and a Led Zeppelin song every time I go anywhere, even if it’s just a quick trip to the store.  And it’s also almost always one of the same few songs from either artist.</p>
<p>NeoClassic Rock looks to change that with a library of thousands of songs, with more being added all the time.  You'll hear your favorite songs and artists, with many that you probably haven't heard in a long time.  Plus, you'll get to hear brand new tracks from many of these same singers and bands, who are still releasing new stuff!</p>
</div></div>","I love music.
I grew up on AOR radio.  AOR stands for Album Oriented Rock, and that meant the station played more than just the hits. I discovered tons of terrific singers and bands thanks to those stations.
For example, back in 1984 (and into 1985), Bruce Springsteen’s “Born In The USA” album spawned seven singles.  Every one of those was a top ten hit.  My favorite songs off that album aren’t any of those seven, though.  They are “No Surrender”, “Bobby Jean” and “Workin’ On The Highway”. I owned the record, of course.  Since it went 15 times platinum (platinum is a million sales), there’s a chance you did, too (or at least, someone you know owned it).  But I grew to really love those three songs from hearing them on the radio.
I still really like them, though I couldn’t even begin to guess when a radio station played them last.  For that matter, you don’t really hear those seven hit singles any more, either, at least not most of them.  “I’m On Fire” is suddenly getting a lot of airplay on a station here, so there’s a pretty good chance that a station near you is playing it all of a sudden, too. A lot of stations these days “test” the music they play.  They do tests over the phone or in auditoriums, with a couple hundred people who fit the demo of their station.  This isn’t just a 2013 phenomenon; it’s been going on for years and years.  That’s why you can travel from town to town and coast to coast, and find stations that play almost the exact same music.
Of course, this doesn’t apply to every single station in America.  But it applies to a lot of them.  Too many.  They become afraid of playing a song that doesn’t test well, or they go the other way and get very excited about a song that does test well.  That’s how a song that you haven’t heard on the radio in thirty years can suddenly pop up often, even daily.  And that’s also why there’s a good chance that your favorite station has slipped “I’m On Fire” back into rotation.
Aside from all the music testing, there’s the multi-tasking issue.  In a lot of stations, the program director and the music director don’t just work for one station. They run several, what the corporations like to call a “cluster”.  So the guy programming your local rock station may also have similar tasks at their sister station, which is country, or adult contemporary.  Or all three.  Or even more.
I like lots of different kinds of music, but I don’t have a real passion for all of them.  And because of that, I don’t really know a lot about them.  So if I suddenly had to program a country station, I’d be in trouble.  Unless someone told me what I should be playing.
Someone who was also telling other country stations what they should play.  Or other adult contemporary stations.  Et cetera.
The other thing is that, for those stations whose employees do care about the music, the same protocols are in place.  Here’s a list of what your station is going to play.
I get that radio stations aren’t jukeboxes, but having someone who doesn’t care about the music deciding what music gets played, based on testing (and other nebulous factors) might give you a good idea about why stations sound the way they do.

<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>A singer since emerging from the womb, Leigh Jones started writing her own music after receiving a ukulele as a Christmas gift in 2009. Since then, she has been building a name for herself in NYC's independent music scene, and has toured around playing prestigious venues on both coasts of the US. She released her debut EP ""Bare Bones,"" in April 2011 to an overwhelmingly positive response. Her folk-leaning music has been described as whimsical, unpredictable, and emotionally stirring, and her voice as earnest and sweet, yet powerfully dynamic.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In February 2012, Leigh will go into the studio to record her first full-length album, entitled ""Worth Wild."" Leigh has become known for her lyrically driven tunes, and while a few of the songs on the album will remain true to the stripped down style of ""Bare Bones,"" Leigh plans to enliven many others by incorporating a wide range of instruments. And this will take time. And as reluctant as we may be to admit it, in many a situation, time equals (dun dun duuuuuun)......money.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>The fundraising goal has been set at $3500, which will roughly cover the recording time in the studio and the printing of the physical CDs. Any funds raised beyond that will go toward mixing and mastering, promotion of the album, and feeding and transporting all the incredible musicians that will be on the album!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In return for your support, you will receive different ""perks"" (outlined in the column to the right), and the chance to be involved in a truly grassroots artistic campaign. The independent musician cannot survive without his or her fans, those who believe in and support the music at its very core, and the rewards are a way to try to express the extent of the gratitude that is felt for your generous support. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With ""Worth Wild,"" Leigh will have a fresh, new, high quality product to share with fans at live shows, and to spread to various online outlets and industry professionals. Feel free to spread the word about this project to friends, via email, facebook, singing telegram, or what have you, and if you feel moved to do so, donate today!</p>

</div></div>","About This Project
A singer since emerging from the womb, Leigh Jones started writing her own music after receiving a ukulele as a Christmas gift in 2009. Since then, she has been building a name for herself in NYC's independent music scene, and has toured around playing prestigious venues on both coasts of the US. She released her debut EP ""Bare Bones,"" in April 2011 to an overwhelmingly positive response. Her folk-leaning music has been described as whimsical, unpredictable, and emotionally stirring, and her voice as earnest and sweet, yet powerfully dynamic.

In February 2012, Leigh will go into the studio to record her first full-length album, entitled ""Worth Wild."" Leigh has become known for her lyrically driven tunes, and while a few of the songs on the album will remain true to the stripped down style of ""Bare Bones,"" Leigh plans to enliven many others by incorporating a wide range of instruments. And this will take time. And as reluctant as we may be to admit it, in many a situation, time equals (dun dun duuuuuun)......money.
 

The fundraising goal has been set at $3500, which will roughly cover the recording time in the studio and the printing of the physical CDs. Any funds raised beyond that will go toward mixing and mastering, promotion of the album, and feeding and transporting all the incredible musicians that will be on the album!

In return for your support, you will receive different ""perks"" (outlined in the column to the right), and the chance to be involved in a truly grassroots artistic campaign. The independent musician cannot survive without his or her fans, those who believe in and support the music at its very core, and the rewards are a way to try to express the extent of the gratitude that is felt for your generous support. 

With ""Worth Wild,"" Leigh will have a fresh, new, high quality product to share with fans at live shows, and to spread to various online outlets and industry professionals. Feel free to spread the word about this project to friends, via email, facebook, singing telegram, or what have you, and if you feel moved to do so, donate today!

<h3>My Goal<br/>
</h3>
<h4>After two years of being asked by fans if I have a CD, the time has finally come: My Goal is to record and complete my Debut CD, ""Be a Light"" by August 31st, 2011, and I'm asking all who feel inspired to partner with me and my amazing band on this soulful journey by donating to this project and helping us spread the word.<br/>
</h4>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Two things have been true for me my whole life: I love to sing and I love to share my love with all who cross my path.  Being raised in a musical family, singing became a natural language for me to express myself and all of my feelings at a young age--one of my favorite things to do beginning around the age of 6 was to spend hours recording myself singing my favorite songs until I got them ""just right."" As I grew up, I discovered another love--nurturing and supporting others in discovering their joy.  After completing a B.A. in Psychology, I attended a Life Coach Training Program and began my coaching practice, Ignite Your Voice Coaching in 2006--I help people feel worthy to celebrate who they are and share themselves fully in the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I began writing my own music in 2008 after asking myself one of my favorite coaching questions: ""If you could attempt one thing knowing that you could not fail, what would it be?"" The answer for me was clear: I would be a singer/songwriter, and spread my message of love and empowerment through my music.  I had so many doubts around my ability to actually live that dream.  I had this belief that despite being a musician my entire life, that it was OTHER people who could play guitar and write songs, not me.  But I strive to live my life with courage and authenticity, so I knew that it was time to start putting one foot in front of the other and pursue my dream.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, 3 years later, I am ready to record my first album and send my love out into the world more fully.  I will be joined in this project by my talented lead guitar player, Joe Harris, my dear friend and mandolin player, Nate Gauger, percussionist and beautiful soul, Pete Calgaro, my talented cousin, Jake, on bass and vocals, and the engineering and prducation staff at Paradyme Productions.  I get goosebumps just thinking about it!<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Donate?</h3>
<p>
I have worked tirelessly over the past four years spending all of my 
resources to build my coaching 
practice and support others in achieving fulfillment, give keynote 
addresses on cultivating joy in our lives, and 
step out more boldly as a singer/songwriter in sharing this positive 
message.  Without your support, I will do all that I can to get my music
 out there, but it will take me MUCH LONGER (as in MAYBE some time next year?) to complete my debut CD.  By
 donating now, you are fueling up my engine so that I can get this CD 
out before summer's end--At a time when the world needs this positive 
message perhaps more than ever<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>.</p>
<br/>My 
message can best be summed up by lyrics from the song that I wrote for 
my godchildren called ""Beautiful Child"":<br/><br/>
""Little Child, sometimes you'll feel as if your heart is wrong, and 
sometimes you'll feel as if you don't belong; but Little Child, if you 
listen to the voice that's deep inside, you will see that all you have 
to do is shine.""<br/><br/>
and lyrics from my song, ""It's Alright""<br/><br/>
""...And the truth is, we're all trying to be good, and all of us just 
want to be understood.  When we seek the truth through another's eyes, 
we realize that we are all the same.""<br/><br/>or my song ""Be Here Now"":<br/><br/>""The moment before me is all that I need, the fear and the sadness my guide.  The more that I open to all that I see, the more I see it all, dissolve into love.""<br/><h4>In this time of great political and 
financial unrest, both at home and abroad, it can <span class=""il"">be</span>
 hard to know where 
to begin when trying to effect positive change.  No matter where we 
might stand politically or spiritually with regard to these issues, I 
think that we can all agree that it is more crucial than ever that we 
send messages of love, hope and gratitude out into the world, and by donating to my album project, that is what you are helping me to do.  </h4>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget Breakdown:<br/>
</h3>
<p>In order to make this album happen, we need $5000 (my goal on this site is $4300 thanks to generous donations over the past few months)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$3500 will go to recording, mixing, mastering, and hiring additional musicians through Paradyme Productions in Madison, WI.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$1500 will go toward creating and duplicating CD's (in a quality case with lyrics sheet, so you can take in all of the juicy lyrics. :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal, as mentioned above, I will still complete this project, it will just take MUCH LONGER for me to make it happen--any money toward this project will hang out in my savings account and solely be used toward making this album and sharing my music with the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If I surpass my financial goal: YIPEE!!! :) Any extra money that I might raise through this campaign will go toward the purchasing of a P.A. system for me and my band.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>See the donation levels on the right of this page to explore all of the super-awesome rewards you will receive when you donate! :)  (Hint: If you want one of the bigger rewards, like a house concert for example, you can pool resources together with friends and make one donation!)<br/></p>

<h1>Beauty in the Breakdown</h1>
<p>I'm here to tell you a little about me and the musical journey that I've been on. I've been making music my whole life- it is everything to me. As the lead singer of MorissonPoe, an Electro-Rock band I was lucky to be able to create a lot of music and grow a really great following, tour the country. We had songs featured in video games and a video that was not only on MTV, but it made the list of nominees for Video of the Year - I'm still kinda in awe about that. ;)</p>
<p>""Beauty In The Breakdown"" is my solo debut album, that takes you through the ups and downs of my past few years...it tells a story...some sexy... some heartbreaking....Life.</p>
<p>With these songs, I've been incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity of music-making with some of the most talented musical minds on the planet, including the one and only Nile Rodgers (CHIC, Madonna, David Bowie), Vernon Reid (Living Color), Raymond Angry (The Roots, Joss Stone), amazing engineer Jason Goldstein (Beyoncé, Lonely Island), Grammy nominated Ian Schreier, the legendary Bob Clearmountain, and many more.</p>
<p>This alone has been a dream come true but for me, my dream is only complete if I can share it with everyone. It takes a lot more than working these greatly talented musicians to release an album - it also takes money, and not wanting to deal with anymore crooks, I need your help!</p>
<p>As a show of my gratitude for all your support, I have come up with a list of ""goodies"" I hope you’ll love. The complete list is located on the right hand side of this page.</p>
<p>That's it! That's me. Thank you for believing in me, supporting my dreams, and helping to fund my album.</p>
<p>Love Always,</p>

Pressing 100 limited-edition CDs + some free goodies like stickers
BEER. We want to have fun.
They told us to keep it professional... We meant books.This IS actually super important to us...Each member of our band LOVES music. We live and breathe new bands, and get pretty stoked about playing live (to an alarming level). From playing weekend tours to turning up after practice, we feel as if we've lived Forward Smash's second run to it's fullest... Almost.
We want our EP to sound AMAZING. Not just ""oh I mean... like... it's cool that you're on a CD"" good, but ""OH MY GOSH MARRY ME"" good.
We're working with two different producers, Mott Cameron (Clementine, 20+ years of experience) has been tracking our new songs in his home studio and they sound GREAT. Brandon Cagle (Whitechapel, Empire, almost tall enough to ride rollercoasters) took our self-tracked old songs and made them into something you can listen to without wanting to die.
If we can raise this money, we will have accomplished almost every single thing on our bucket lists with regards to being in a band. 3/4ths of the band are graduating and we'd love to make this EP something that we'll all look back on with pride.
What you get""I don't really care about your band; I just went here because Brian's feet are broken and I feel bad..."" WELL WE HAVE PRIZES IN STORE FOR YOU.
There are rewards at every level of the budget!! This is also our way of letting you pre-order our EP (still unnamed) and party.
You'll feel like a champ for supporting a local band who needs money to do cool things
Here's some of our music that you can listen to for free now: forwardsmash.bandcamp.com/track/b-is-for-biddie
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you're also broke, it's okay. You can share this online, tell friends, or steal money from someone... please don't do that last one.
We'd love it if you could share on facebook, instagram, myspace, friendster, or AOL online
You can use the Indiegogo share tools!
Hashtag #forwardsmash #tourwardsmash or #turndownfornothing to spread the word
If you've read all the way down to here, you're a real champ and a winner. We love you with our whole hearts (Dalton's is alarmingly large for some reason), and hope you can find a way to help!-Forward Smash (Mark, Nate, Dalton, Brian, and sometimes James)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

'Death Drive' is a collision of two very distinct worlds; the
      scorched earth of indie rap legend, Sole, and the
      concrete jungles of certified platinum producer, DJ Pain1. 'Death Drive' combines modern
      pop/rap aesthetics with the political edge reminiscent of hip-hop
      classics such as “Fear Of A Black Planet"". Sole & DJ Pain1
      utilize the golden era hip-hop approach of a rapper and DJ without
      employing gimmicks or rap cliches typical with more formulaic
      two-turntables-and-a-mic unions. Cross-pollination between
      mainstream music and the underground has been happening for years,
      but anything that bubbles up is always devoid of substance. Death
      Drive is a political rap album executed in a way that eschews the
      rapper persona of savior/prophet and speaks from the riot line. In
      a period of human history where critical music is absent from the
      airwaves, this is true
      resistance music. (Overseas orders please add shipping costs per item)
Sole: In
      1998 he founded Anticon Records, the first collectively owned
      indie Hip-Hop label in the United States. Since then, Sole has
      played over a thousand shows throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe,
      the Middle East and Japan. Recently, Sole pulled his masters from anticon and has
      re-invented himself as a new kind of artist, business, and
      political entity. His music has been featured in major media
      outlets such as Rolling Stone, 2DopeBoyz, Pitchfork, MTV, Huffington Post, Spin, Alarm Press, Alternet and many more. Sole has released
      ten full length studio albums and over a dozen mixtapes.
      Throughout his career sole has been known as one to push the
      limits in terms of genre and content and is widely heralded as a
      pioneer of avant garde & experimental rap music. This year,
      Sole & his wife Yasamin released the instrumental project WHITENOISE and Sole launched ""The Solecast"",
      a podcast featuring long form interviews with academics, artists
      and activists . Sole’s activism reaches beyond the studio and stage
      into his everyday life where he is deeply involved material and
      logistical support to many projects that engage directly in the class
        struggle.

          Crass of the hip-hop world” - Diffuser.fm
DJ Pain 1: Known for his 2008
      break-out beat on ""Don't Do It"" for Young Jeezy's
      platinum-selling album ""The Recession"", producer DJ Pain 1 stays
      busy. He tours as a DJ, produces full albums, as well
      as creating original and free content for the producer
      community - this Hip-Hop musician takes no breaks. Pain 1 spent the late 90's
      cultivating his hip-hop sensibilities through graffiti, DJing and
      beatmaking. He juggled a youth service/teaching career with
      creating music, often times marrying the two worlds-- he
      co-founded the first hip-hop performing arts program to be hosted
      in an institute of higher education in his city. Once Pain 1
      decided to focus on his production career, his resume quickly grew
      to include both legendary hip-hop acts (Public Enemy, Kool G Rap, MC Lyte) as well as contemporary hit-makers
      (Juicy J, 2 Chainz, 50 Cent). He has also garnered attention for
      his multiple Youtube video series on both production technique and music business know-how.  ""[T]he next truth in sonic production."" - Chuck D of
          Public Enemy""DJ Pain 1 has done a lot for Madison’s hip-hop rep and a

<p>Park Jam seeks to improve the vitality of Long Beach by: 1) building stronger community cohesiveness through art, performance and music; 2) celebrate the highly diverse traditions of Long Beach; 3) build social capital between diverse groups; 3) empower youth through meaningful participation and leadership opportunities and; 4) create a forum that welcomes participation and collaboration in a non-restrictive format.</p>
<p>Park Jam’s welcomes over 500  participants monthly.  Each month the entertainment differs based on what attendees bring to share.  This variation keeps our event relevant.  The music line up is made up of volunteer DJ’s who play  a variety of genres of music including reggae, hip hop, techno, Latin, Motown hits and experimental track.  A dance floor with people of all ages ensues.  Each event also features a dance or musical performance that reflects our city’s diverse cultural traditions. Past performers include LA Influence (a Long Beach salsa dancing team), African dancers from the Homeland Cultural Center, Capoeira dancers, Sirena Serpentina fire dancers and others.</p>
<p>Creating a space for artistic expression is an important goal of the event. Local artists share their talents by displaying their art well as creating live works during the event.  Volunteers bring hands-on activities for youth and participatory arts projects for adults.  Our event is also a forum for ideas; political and environmental activists and local hopeful elected officials attend to connect with potential constituencies.  Park Jam also integrates a variety of onetime special events that respond to the interests and needs of our community.  Past special events include youth talent shows, water fights, relay races, yoga, fashion shows, organized sports, films and  a bicycle contest by team Epic.  One regular attendee, Matthew Ota, brings his large telescope to share his love for astronomy with Park Jammers.   </p>

<p> <strong>What We Need</strong></p>

We are hoping to raise enough money to cover tuition and perhaps a bit more for my travelling costs to the Big Apple.The ImpactI am incredibly dedicated to my passion and work very hard in school, at work and on the stage. To be able to work with such a high caliber group of instructors and like-minded peers and then to cap it all off by performing on the stage of Carnegie Hall would be beyond enriching and inspiring - it would be an actual dream come true.

led, directed, and performed with various groups throughout the world for the
past three decades. One of the highlights of my career was playing and recording
with the great drummer, Rashied Ali. I’ve also performed with Carlos Santana,
Ornette Coleman, Flava Flav, Alyson Williams, T. S. Monk, Grachan Moncur, III, Ravi Coltrane, Harry Connick, Jr., Raphael Cruz, Iris Chacon, Donald Harrison, Dizzy Reece, Wynton Marsalis, Joe Lovano and Arthur Taylor, as well as countless other
great musicians.</p>
<p>I’m recording material for my new album, ""Blues for Miles."" The CD is going to be
released on my label, JazzIntensity Records. Here is a list of musicians currently confirmed to play on <i>Blues for Miles:</i></p><p>Raphael Cruz (Miles Davis, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, George Benson, Chaka Kahn, Herbie Mann, The Crusaders, etc.) - Percussion</p><p>Josh Evans (Cedar Walton, Benny Golson, Ralph Peterson, Winard Harper, Shelia Jordan, Rashied Ali, etc.) - Trumpet</p><p>Bruce Cox (Sonny Rollins, Fred Wesley and the New JBs, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">JJ Johnson, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Memphis Slim,</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Stanley Turrentine, DeeDee Bridgewater, etc.) - Drums</span></p><p>Tom DiCarlo (Stanley Cowell, Norman Simmons, etc.) - Bass</p><p>Kush Abadey (Wallace Roney, Frank Lacy, etc.) - Drums</p><p>Ben Solomon (Wallace Roney, etc.) - Tenor Sax</p><p>Luis Guell (6 Grammy Nominations for Mastering, Mixing, etc.) - Engineer</p>
<p>It’s going to be a great album, but with your help it’s
going to be extraordinary. Your contribution is key to achieving my goal - to
get the album to number one (#1) on the national jazz charts. This is
definitely an achievable goal as I’ve gotten my previous album “Orientation” in
the top 50 of the national jazz charts for radio airplay.</p>
<p>I’m trying to raise $15,000. Here’s a breakdown of the
budget:</p>
<p>Production costs - $8,500</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio
     fees - $3,500 for recording, mixing and mastering</li>
<li>Musician
     fees - $5,000</li>
</ul><p>Post Production costs - $2,500</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover
     art (graphics) and liner notes - $1,000</li>
<li>CD
     manufacturing - $1,500</li>
</ul><p>Distribution and Promotion costs - $4,000</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribution
     to online stores, websites, magazines and publications - $1,000</li>
<li>Radio
     Promotion - $3,000</li>
</ul><p>When you contribute, some of the perks you’ll receive are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wristbands,
     T-Shirts</li>
<li>Mp3
     downloads, Autographed CDs</li>
<li>Autographed
     Score, Private piano lessons</li>
<li>Co-Executive
     and Executive Producer credit</li>
<li>The
     opportunity to name a composition</li>
<li>Free
     admission and beverages to upcoming concerts</li>
<li>Private
     performance in the NYC metro area and beyond</li>
</ul><p>So far, I’ve recorded some solo piano and trio compositions
for this project, and I have more material that I’d like to include. Tom
DiCarlo and Chris Beck did a fantastic job on bass and drums and Jay Rodriguez
did an awesome job of recording me and the group. All of the music in the promo video was recorded
at these sessions.</p>
<p>100% of your contribution will go directly toward the
completion of this project. If we don’t reach our funding goals during this
campaign we will raise the funds through additional methods.</p>
<p>Your contribution is extremely
valuable. You will be contributing to the development and preservation of the
Jazz Art-Form, which has strong roots in the African-American community - a
community of which I am part. You’ll also be helping the other musicians,
artists and technicians involved in this project. </p>
<p>I’ve had some success with my
last album. With your help, this album will be exponentially more successful.</p>
<p>There are other ways that you can
help besides contributing financially:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about this

<p>Greg</p><p><b>BIOGRAPHY</b></p><p></p><p>An experienced
improviser, composer, arranger and teacher, Greg Murphy has led,
directed and performed with various groups throughout the world for the past
three decades. Maxwell Chandler of JazzPolice.com writes in a 2009 review of
Rashied Ali Quintet’s <i>Live in Europe: </i>“Throughout the album Greg Murphy’s piano
possesses a cerebral element which allows for shimmering smoke and discordant
percussive runs while never becoming overly fragile or sounding as if merely hitting
the keys hard and fast.” In a 2007 review of Greg’s CD, <i>Orientation</i>, Charles Winokoor of Cadence Magazine writes “…throw a
tongue-twisting, rapid-fire chart at this son of a gun and watch out-he can
burn with the best of them. And did I mention his band is the embodiment of
liquid flame? Well they are, and so is Murphy, which is why one should keep
posted.”</p>
<p>A jazz study
grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1984 gave Greg the
opportunity to go New Orleans
and study with the eminent pianist and jazz educator, Ellis Marsalis.  He remained there and began recording and
performing with The New Orleans Jazz Couriers, Percussion Incorporated, and his
own group, The Fusicians.  The Percussion
Incorporated album, <i>Drum Talk,</i> was recorded and released in 1987. While
living in the crescent city, Greg performed with Donald Harrison, Wynton
Marsalis, and countless other great musicians.</p>
<p>Greg moved to New York in 1987 and
began what had become a long association with multi-directional drummer,
Rashied Ali.  Greg performed and recorded
with Ali and his various groups throughout Europe, Canada,
the United States
and beyond, from 1987 until Rashied passed away in 2009.  Below are some additional highlights of Greg’s

<p></p></div>","Blues for Miles Recording ProjectHi, my name is Greg Murphy and I’m a pianist and composer. I’ve
led, directed, and performed with various groups throughout the world for the
past three decades. One of the highlights of my career was playing and recording
with the great drummer, Rashied Ali. I’ve also performed with Carlos Santana,
Ornette Coleman, Flava Flav, Alyson Williams, T. S. Monk, Grachan Moncur, III, Ravi Coltrane, Harry Connick, Jr., Raphael Cruz, Iris Chacon, Donald Harrison, Dizzy Reece, Wynton Marsalis, Joe Lovano and Arthur Taylor, as well as countless other
great musicians.
I’m recording material for my new album, ""Blues for Miles."" The CD is going to be
released on my label, JazzIntensity Records. Here is a list of musicians currently confirmed to play on Blues for Miles:Raphael Cruz (Miles Davis, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, George Benson, Chaka Kahn, Herbie Mann, The Crusaders, etc.) - PercussionJosh Evans (Cedar Walton, Benny Golson, Ralph Peterson, Winard Harper, Shelia Jordan, Rashied Ali, etc.) - TrumpetBruce Cox (Sonny Rollins, Fred Wesley and the New JBs, JJ Johnson, Memphis Slim, Stanley Turrentine, DeeDee Bridgewater, etc.) - DrumsTom DiCarlo (Stanley Cowell, Norman Simmons, etc.) - BassKush Abadey (Wallace Roney, Frank Lacy, etc.) - DrumsBen Solomon (Wallace Roney, etc.) - Tenor SaxLuis Guell (6 Grammy Nominations for Mastering, Mixing, etc.) - Engineer
It’s going to be a great album, but with your help it’s
going to be extraordinary. Your contribution is key to achieving my goal - to
get the album to number one (#1) on the national jazz charts. This is
definitely an achievable goal as I’ve gotten my previous album “Orientation” in
the top 50 of the national jazz charts for radio airplay.
I’m trying to raise $15,000. Here’s a breakdown of the
budget:
Production costs - $8,500

Studio
     fees - $3,500 for recording, mixing and mastering
Musician
     fees - $5,000
Post Production costs - $2,500

Cover
     art (graphics) and liner notes - $1,000
CD
     manufacturing - $1,500
Distribution and Promotion costs - $4,000

Distribution
     to online stores, websites, magazines and publications - $1,000
Radio
     Promotion - $3,000
When you contribute, some of the perks you’ll receive are:

Wristbands,
     T-Shirts
Mp3
     downloads, Autographed CDs
Autographed
     Score, Private piano lessons
Co-Executive
     and Executive Producer credit
The
     opportunity to name a composition
Free
     admission and beverages to upcoming concerts
Private
     performance in the NYC metro area and beyond
So far, I’ve recorded some solo piano and trio compositions
for this project, and I have more material that I’d like to include. Tom
DiCarlo and Chris Beck did a fantastic job on bass and drums and Jay Rodriguez
did an awesome job of recording me and the group. All of the music in the promo video was recorded
at these sessions.
100% of your contribution will go directly toward the
completion of this project. If we don’t reach our funding goals during this
campaign we will raise the funds through additional methods.
Your contribution is extremely
valuable. You will be contributing to the development and preservation of the
Jazz Art-Form, which has strong roots in the African-American community - a
community of which I am part. You’ll also be helping the other musicians,
artists and technicians involved in this project. 
I’ve had some success with my
last album. With your help, this album will be exponentially more successful.
There are other ways that you can
help besides contributing financially:

Get the word out and make some noise about this
     campaign
Use the Indiegogo share tools!
I will certainly keep you updated on the progress of our project
throughout the campaign.
Thanks and have a great week!

</div>
<p>Hello friends, family, and fans!</p>
<p>I just want to say thank you.<span> 
Thank you for your generous support for all these years.  Through the shows, the albums, the writing
sessions, and supporting the bands I’ve been playing with; it has been both a
challenging and amazing journey, during some of the toughest times in the
history of the music business.</span></p>
<p>At times I have wanted to just quit, so tired of all the lies
and dishonesty the music industry can throw at you.<span>  But it is what I love and you are the reason
I continue to do it.  Some time ago, with
your support of my pledge campaign, I was able to raise the funds needed to
record my best work to date.  An amazing
young producer named Brian Craddock (Daughtry) helped me regain my self
confidence as a musician and a writer. 
“Cross the Line” was the first track I wrote with him on the first day
back to work, and we both looked at each other like we had discovered the Holy
Grail.  I was back and finally with a
producer I could trust.</span></p>
<p>Your support and faith in me was what kept me going; it kept
me from calling it a day and hanging up my guitar forever.<span>  The positive outreach from everyone, from
phone calls to texts and emails, kept me going. 
Through the last campaign, I can say I met some lifelong friends and
amazing people that will forever be with me. 
You’re all stuck with me.</span></p>
<p>As a new season is about to begin, I’ve learned that crowd
funding and asking people for help is okay, and that without your support I
might never fully realize my dreams.<span>  You
have replaced the record labels.  Crowd
funding is one of the coolest, most personal ways that a person can become a
part of a team, be a partner in dream building, and the most amazing way of
getting to know someone while simultaneously making “our” music available globally.</span></p>
<p>The goal is to raise $35,000.<span> 
How will this money be spent?  A
portion will be used to hire A&amp;R Worldwide, a proven and trusted
organization that has worked extensively with one of my main and most trusted
advisors.  They are the very successful
independent A&amp;R company located in Los Angeles, specializing in doing what
the labels “used to do”, artist development and promotion.  (They’re the nice folks who played a key role
in breaking artists like Katy Perry, Adele, Coldplay, Train, and Jessie
J.)  Some of the money will be spent
going back in the studio with Brian finishing new tracks, some for radio
promotion, and the balance will be used for tour support and merchandise.</span></p>
<p>Your support and partnership is the only way I can keep making
music and keep this dream alive.<span>  And
speaking of dreams, I am lucky enough to have teamed up with Huddl.org and its
founder Josh Rizzo.  I am doing this
campaign not only for myself, but to help them raise awareness about their
organization.  Huddl.org provides an
anonymous social community open to all, presented by PTSD UNITED, providing
help, support and resources for sufferers of PTSD, their friends and
family.  Think of Facebook, but with WAY
more potential to help people rather than just play Candy Crush and Farmville.</span></p>
<p>I am going to raise the bar this time around when it comes to
thanking you for your support.<span>  Amazing exclusives
not only for you, but for those men and women who went into harms way to defend
our freedom.  You may designate that a
gift box, sent on your behalf, be sent to active duty and deployed soldiers
that contain basic, everyday items we take for granted such as soap, candy,
toothbrushes, toothpaste... and even coffee. 
I mean, doesn’t everyone deserve to taste The Cat Room coffee?!  It’s a way to “pay it forward” with just one
contribution, helping more than just myself. 
You can also get Rob Michaels and Huddl merch, guitar picks, spend a day
in the studio with us, merch bundles… even custom made ammo boxes filled with
merch and other goodies… and obviously, the music.  And it should go without saying that we will
communicate often, providing you updates throughout to keep you involved.</span></p>
<p>Any donation amount is greatly appreciated.<span>  And you know how else you can help?  Talk about this project.  Help us publicize this by sharing your
support on all social media – especially Facebook and Twitter.  Scream it from mountain tops.  Tell the world how we’re working together to
get some great music out to everyone and help soldiers at the same time!</span></p>
<p>So, what do you say?<span> 
Partners?</span></p>

portion will be used to hire A&R Worldwide, a proven and trusted
organization that has worked extensively with one of my main and most trusted
advisors.  They are the very successful
independent A&R company located in Los Angeles, specializing in doing what
the labels “used to do”, artist development and promotion.  (They’re the nice folks who played a key role
in breaking artists like Katy Perry, Adele, Coldplay, Train, and Jessie
J.)  Some of the money will be spent
going back in the studio with Brian finishing new tracks, some for radio
promotion, and the balance will be used for tour support and merchandise.
Your support and partnership is the only way I can keep making
music and keep this dream alive.  And
speaking of dreams, I am lucky enough to have teamed up with Huddl.org and its
founder Josh Rizzo.  I am doing this
campaign not only for myself, but to help them raise awareness about their
organization.  Huddl.org provides an
anonymous social community open to all, presented by PTSD UNITED, providing
help, support and resources for sufferers of PTSD, their friends and
family.  Think of Facebook, but with WAY
more potential to help people rather than just play Candy Crush and Farmville.
I am going to raise the bar this time around when it comes to
thanking you for your support.  Amazing exclusives
not only for you, but for those men and women who went into harms way to defend
our freedom.  You may designate that a
gift box, sent on your behalf, be sent to active duty and deployed soldiers
that contain basic, everyday items we take for granted such as soap, candy,
toothbrushes, toothpaste... and even coffee. 
I mean, doesn’t everyone deserve to taste The Cat Room coffee?!  It’s a way to “pay it forward” with just one
contribution, helping more than just myself. 
You can also get Rob Michaels and Huddl merch, guitar picks, spend a day
in the studio with us, merch bundles… even custom made ammo boxes filled with
merch and other goodies… and obviously, the music.  And it should go without saying that we will
communicate often, providing you updates throughout to keep you involved.
Any donation amount is greatly appreciated.  And you know how else you can help?  Talk about this project.  Help us publicize this by sharing your
support on all social media – especially Facebook and Twitter.  Scream it from mountain tops.  Tell the world how we’re working together to
get some great music out to everyone and help soldiers at the same time!
So, what do you say?

<p>Hi! We are <a href=""http://www.marichkaconnection.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marichka Connection</a>  italo-belgian Folk-Rock storytellers born from the melting pot of the belgian capital and a bit of italian background.  With plenty of Brasseries gigs since 2010, we have shared our energy on stages like the Assisi Festival, The Ferrara Buskers Festival, The Antitapas Nights, and on several stages and festivals of Netherland, France and Italy.<br/></p>
<p>After 6 years of musical and personal growth we are finally ready to present our first album ""Fuga dal Paradiso"" that will be launched in Brussels on the 16th of June!</p>
<p>Now we want to produce two new music videoclips about two songs of the album....but we spent all our money in the preparation of the album!  :( <br/></p>
<p>....That's why we are asking for your support! <br/></p>
<p><b></b><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><b>Why 2 new videoclips?</b></b></b></h3>5 years ago a good friend supported us in the preparation of the videoclip <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmEyfF5xysg&amp;list=TLPoPsnrlwOAsHw_Tsq-wzTSSva97XZmfK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Il Barone Rampante</a> . It was an amazing experience with an amazing result. We realised then that videos are in the blood of our songs full of stories and images. <br/><p></p>
<p>Videos are also the best way to promote our newborn album. We would like to make as many videos as there are songs in the album, but with a limited budget we think that we can make only two videos that keep the quality of their ""ancestor"".<br/></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Be the producer of our new videos</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Each video will cost us around 1.500 euros. With a team of special and very motivated people we can make a fantastic videoclip out of this little budget.</p>
<p>We are already shooting the first one with the following costs:</p>
<p>- Director: 450 euro</p>
<p>- Animation: 600 euro</p>
<p>- Cameraman with top equipment: 200 euro</p>
<p>- Editor: 150 euro</p>
<p>- Casting: 50 euro</p>
<p>- Shooting catering for 25 people: 100 euro</p>
<p>- Scenography; 150 euro<br/></p>
<p>If you will support us you will make it possible to finalise this and the next one that will have probably a smaller budget due to the absence of an animation part. <br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>Once you will participate to this crowdfunding campaign you will enter in the magic circle of the producers of Marichka Connection: first of all, we will decide together the song of the second video.</p>

<p>""Fuga dal Paradiso"" is our newborn album. It is the
biography of the escape from a golden cage, similar to the one made by “Il

and already broadcasted by Radio Nostalgie Belgique and by hundred of local radios in Italy. (<a href=""http://www.marichkaconnection.com/#!chi-siamo1/cwzs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link to press kit</a>). <br/></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0.1pt 0in;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Times;"">For fans of the song and how to feel
it. Kath Bloom (USA) is some kind of legend. She comes from a special place
where country, blues and folk are made beautifully translucent and emotive. She
has a special gift ï¿½ her delicate, tender voice yet she retains that raw
emotion and hard worn truths that allows each sung word to be felt.</span></p>

you notice itï¿½s not just the arresting voice, but the power of the songwriting.
ï¿½Beautifulï¿½ is the typical responseï¿½the kind of beauty that comes from truth,
musical and the deeply lyrical. There are no good comparisons, but if you like
the deep well of Emmylou Harris, the more poignant lyrics of Lou Reed, the joy
of Maher Shalal Hash Baz or even Joni Mitchell your kinda in the right zone. In
reality, sheï¿½s simply Kath Bloom: horse whisperer, vocalist, mum, songwriter
and a beautiful person.</span></p>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></div>","Biography
For fans of the song and how to feel
it. Kath Bloom (USA) is some kind of legend. She comes from a special place
where country, blues and folk are made beautifully translucent and emotive. She
has a special gift ï¿½ her delicate, tender voice yet she retains that raw
emotion and hard worn truths that allows each sung word to be felt.
The more you hear Kath Bloom, the more
you notice itï¿½s not just the arresting voice, but the power of the songwriting.
ï¿½Beautifulï¿½ is the typical responseï¿½the kind of beauty that comes from truth,
musical and the deeply lyrical. There are no good comparisons, but if you like
the deep well of Emmylou Harris, the more poignant lyrics of Lou Reed, the joy
of Maher Shalal Hash Baz or even Joni Mitchell your kinda in the right zone. In
reality, sheï¿½s simply Kath Bloom: horse whisperer, vocalist, mum, songwriter
and a beautiful person.
Her albums recorded with Loren
Mazzacane Connors in the 70?s/80?s are rare things, full of songs that
float and melt into the ether. Impossibly beautiful and hard to find on LP, but
check the reissues from a few years ago . In the 90?s Kathï¿½s music was famously featured in
Richard Linklaterï¿½s film Before Sunrise. Since then she has been busy writing
and recording to great acclaim. Two new albums in the last few years and she
and her songs where also honored on a tribute album featuring Bill Callahan,
Scout Niblett and Mark Kozelek.
Pitchfork, the influential online music
publication, had this to say about Kathï¿½s last record:  ï¿½Bloom sounds like a woman who has
spent years in the wildernessï¿½ An earthy, unpretentious presence, she can snap
a heart like a twigï¿½
 
The
Goal
The goal of this campaign, simply
stated, is to raise funds to help Kath Bloom record her new record.  Kath is coming to Los Angeles to record her new tunes.  The idea is to go into the studio with her friends and do what Kath does best, make honest music from the heart.  Kath is joining up with a cast of musicians, mostly under the age of 30, whom she has meet touring the U.S. over the past few years.  This new energy with wisdom is a sound I'm so eager to hear and participate in.
 
The
Rewards
Of course there is no greater reward
than knowing that you are helping an artist accomplish their vision, but in
addition to that Kath has arranged some really special one of a kind gifts for
those of you who choose to contribute. 
She has some really raw self-recorded unreleased tracks that she will
e-mail in mp3 form to entry level donors, hand written lyrics and/or hand
written poems to mid level donors, for the dedicated Kath Bloom fan a super
rare and I mean RARE authentic original ï¿½Restless, Faithful, Desperateï¿½ LP from
the early 1980ï¿½s, and the grand prize for the high rollers will be an original
one of a kind framed Kath Bloom Painting.
 
Thanks in advance to everyone for your
help, catch you on the flip side!
