<h2>What Is A Semi-permanent Adapter? </h2>

<p>    There are many smartphone adapters for microscopes and telescopes and all of them share the same problem: they occupy the eyepieces while performing ""phoneography."" When multiple consecutive observations are needed, the users have to mount and dismount the adapters repeatedly. Some adapters have fast release mechanisms to address this problem but such mechanisms would also compromise the stability more or less.  A semi-permanent adapter is composed of an adapter ring clamp to fit eyepieces with diameters within certain ranges, and a phone shuttle which is a special designed universal phone holder that can move the phone back and forth.</p>

<p>From a developer and
creator's perspective, I would like to say that there are no risks with my
product. However, I've never attempted mass production of Xl.i.Con and
unexpected issues may arise once we are able to start. Tech products especially
with their number of intricate parts may run into hurdles in mass production.
Especially given the number of devices that we have planned in the Xl.i.CON
line, we have our work cut out for us to develop and test everything. However,
given what we have seen with our working prototypes we feel confident that we
can deliver based on our planned schedule. All of your funds will be placed
into making the current Xl.i.CON accessories line and we hope that we get
funded enough to continue working on even more Xl Devices. </p>

</div></div>","The iPhone accessories market has boomed recently thereby enhancing the 
functionality and convenience of using your iPhone. However, these 
accessories are hampered by the iPhone's limitation of only having one 
lightning port to connect, which typically is used for charging. Imagine
 if you had another port on your iPhone, to connect to iPhone 
accessories while leaving your lightning port free. What would you do 
with 2X the functionality?Meet Xl.i.CON, the iPhone and PC accessories line that was awarded the 2016 CES Innovation award. Xl.i.CON is our brand new line of accessories that connect via X Link technology. X Link, our patented technology, is a unique way to connect your iPhone or PC to a diverse line of accessories. Connecting through neodynium magnets,there are no cables. No cables to fray, go missing or get tangled. Use the Xl Case to connect to your iPhone or Xl HUB to connect to your PC. The number of potential Xl devices that can be connected through X link technology are endless. See some of our currently developed  Xl-devices below. Many more Xl-devices are currently in development and through Xl.i.CON we hope to revolutionize the accessories market. 




Awarded as a 2016 CES Honoree, one Xl Flash Memory expands your iPhone’s storage by up to 64G and allows 
for simple and intuitive transfer of data from your iPhone to your PC 
and vice versa. This tiny USB flash memory connects 
seamlessly to your iPhone and PC making the transfer and streaming of 
files much simpler between the two. About the size of a button, Xl Flash Memory doesn't jut out 
awkwardly from the bottom of your phone and instead clicks directly into
 the X Link on your Xl Case. As soon as you snap Xl Flash Memory to the 
back of your iPhone, you can access your data via an application. By utilizing multiple Xl Flash Memory drives, you can increase your iPhone's storage by as much as you desire and Xl Flash Memory supports all file types including  pictures, movies, and music. With all that storage space imagine the possibilities:
Store and stream your entire music library 

Store and play a library of HD movies 

Shoot long-duration HD videos using your iPhone camera 

Xl Flash Memory allows you to take all of your data on-the-go all in a small portable USB drive while also allowing for seamless transfer of files from your iPhone to PC. This is the potential of X link technology. Xl Earbuds are truly digital headphones that deliver much higher fidelity music than earphones that connect via the earphone jack.  Xl Earbuds have an imbedded USB Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) and amplifier, allowing you to bypass your iPhone's clunkier system and receive pure digital audio data. Unlike other digital headphones, Xl Earbuds connect via X Link technology allowing for simultaneous charging via lightning port and phone call compatibility.Xl Dock is the first dock that allows for simultaneous sync and 2X charging. The dock also can be used as a portable battery so you can wirelessly charge at 2X speeds on-the-go. Equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Xl Dock is compatible with the Xl.i.CON application. Through the Xl.i.CON application you can manage battery life for both
 your iPhone and Xl Dock. Unlike other docks, which display remaining 
battery life via a series of coloured lights,the Xl.i.CON App displays 
it down to an exact percentage. The Xl.i.CON app also allows you to 
toggle between two charging modes: Speed mode and Eco mode. Speed mode 
charges your iPhone at 2X speed. In Eco mode, choose efficiency over 
speed. Many chargers on the market are highly inefficient and leak 
energy uselessly.  Eco mode, charges at 95% efficiency making it 
both eco-friendly and a relief to the user’s energy bills. The Xl.i.CON 
app also contains an anti-loss function. When your iPhone is separated a
 set distance from your Xl Power Dock, you will receive an alert 
saying ""Oops! Leave me now?""Xl Case is equipped with our trademarked X link technology so you can connect your iPhone to our line of Xl-Devices. With Xl Case you have the option to switch your lightning port to a more universal Micro 5 pin port. Additionally, the speaker enclosure around Xl case was built to audibly increase the natural sound output of your iPhone.  All future Xl devices will also be capable of connecting to your iPhone via Xl Case.Xl HUB allows you to connect X link devices to your PC. With 2 USB A type ports, 2 USB C type ports and 3X link ports, the connectivity options to your computer are enhanced to greater heights. All future Xl devices will also be capable of connecting to your computer via Xl HUB.

<div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>You want to travel for business or a holiday, or to move to another country, but there’s something holding you back…  that scared and anxious feeling in your stomach.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Well, you’re not alone. Even if  I’m well prepared, there are still many worries and doubts. Will I deal with the foreign language? Will I miss my home? Will I feel homesick? Who can I turn to in case of need? And so on and so on. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>Traveling and moving abroad are amazing experiences but this is why many people end up doing nothing and never leave the places they are comfortable with. </p>
<p>So how can this problem be solved? How can we stay calm abroad? </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The answer is simple: If we know BEFORE travelling that we’ll receive a warm welcome and a helping hand from people who speak our own language and who are already living in the country we’re travelling to.</p>
<p>And this is what My Global Welcome is about.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is the WORLD’S FIRST SOCIAL NETWORK that eliminates the language problem before and while we’re moving in the world because it connects us with our fellow countrymen abroad who can help us with whatever problem we’ll have.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The New York Journal calls My Global Welcome the TRAVEL REVOLUTION. For sure it is, even if we are still completely overwhelmed by the massive media coverage we already received before the launch of our campaign. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are thrilled, but hey guys, this time it’s not anxiety, but this pure rush of adrenalin because we begin to realize that with your help, something ground-breaking starts right here and right now. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you, too, like the idea of feeling at home wherever you go and if you believe that this can make our life easier, then please show your support for My Global Welcome. Don't miss out this once in a lifetime opportunity to make part of something truly great. And most importantly, please contact me at <a href=""mailto:info@myglobalwelcome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@myglobalwelcome.com</a> to provide ideas and feedback. Love, Michaela (CEO &amp; Founder of My Global Welcome)</p>

<p><i>(first page of My Global Welcome)</i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">It’s easy and fun to use. In my case, I’m German and if I need information from other fellow German countrymen in Udine, Italy, for example, I simply first select the nationality of my fellow countrymen (in my case Germans), then the country (in my case Italy), and then the city (in my case Udine). </div>
<p>Then you choose why you would like to contact your fellow countrymen abroad. Is it for reliable, firsthand information before you start travelling or before you move? Do you want to meet or chat online? Do you need language assistance when you get in a foreign country? Do you need to move with your kids? Would you like for somebody to send you an item from abroad? Do you need a ride or accommodation in a foreign country? Would you like to eat at home with some company? Are you looking for a city or outdoor guide or would you like that somebody organizes an event for you in the country you're travelling to? </p>
<p>Then you click on ""search compatrios"" and it will take you to the second page.</p>

<div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since My Global Welcome uses geolocation, it will immediately come up with a couple of fellow countrymen that match your selection, here, for example, Germans that live in Udine and that are available to meet and chat or for language assistance. You choose the person you'd like to get to know, then click on the ""contact"" button which takes you to the third page.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466320893/mock-up_terza_pagina_gecild.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 677.24px;height: 698px;""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Here you'll receive information on your fellow countrymen, where they are from, when and why they moved, their occupation, their hobbies and interests and what they like most about their new life. Only if you choose to contact them, will you be asked to log in at this point. Want to see other fellow countrymen first? No problem. They are shown underneath.

</h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span><p>For the creation of My Global Welcome and My Global Welcome for mobile devices (e.g. smartphone and tablet) we need $ 20.000.</p>
<p>Additional expenses include: administrative, consumption, financial, management and particularly marketing and PR costs for year 1. </p>
<p>This is how the costs break down:</p>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is why your help is absolutely fundamental. The more money we raise, the more we can invest in marketing and PR worldwide, and My Global Welcome will be available to use sooner, wherever you go. </p>
<p>Please note that contributions are possible both via paypal OR CREDIT CARD. To contribute via direct credit card, just click on the ""BACK IT"" button on the top-right of this page or, better yet, click on a perk :-) On the second page, insert your details and click on ""CONTINUE TO PAYPAL"".  On the third page, it says ""Login to your Paypal account"" OR ""Pay with a credit or debit card"". It's really easy!</p>
<p>At this point, we would like to especially thank Hans Stadtmüller, Fritz Kustatscher and Michael Schlemm, our early investors, who were convinced that My Global Welcome will genuinely alter your life for the better.</p>

<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;"">Cos'è My Global Welcome?</span><br/>
</div></b><p></p>
<p>Ciao,<br/></p>
<p>il mio nome è Michaela e negli ultimi 20 anni ho lavorato nel settore lingue e comunicazione, con persone provenienti da tutto il mondo.</p>
<p>Dunque, io sono tedesca e mi sono trasferita in Italia diversi anni fa. Ho subito scoperto a mie spese che trasferirsi da un paese all'altro in realtà non è lo stesso che spostarsi dietro l'angolo. Se dovete avere a che fare con un nuovo paese, tutta la familiarità smette di esistere.</p>
<p>Prima di tutto, mi sono resa conto che il mio paese ospitante aveva totalmente diverse tradizioni e valori sociali. Per non parlare della diversa cultura!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In secondo luogo, ho dovuto affrontare gli aspetti pratici della vita di ogni giorno, come ad esempio la logistica del trasferimento, i visti, la residenza, l'alloggio, la sanità, la contabilità, l'occupazione, i trasporti e così via.</p>
<p>E <i>last-but-not-least</i> la lingua. Vi posso assicurare che è davvero difficile affrontare con successo i problemi di tutti i giorni in una lingua straniera.</p>
<p>Ovviamente ho anche fatto qualche errore piuttosto imbarazzante, poiché non vi è alcun manuale di istruzioni su come fare i conti con un nuovo paese.</p>
<p>Poi ho capito che i miei problemi erano gli stessi che avevano altre persone. Non importa se le persone viaggiano per affari o per vacanza, o se si trasferiscono in un nuovo paese, è sempre una grande sfida e, a volte, anche un incubo logistico ed emotivo affrontare un ambiente non familiare, una nuova lingua e una nuova cultura.</p>
<p>A questo punto, ho pensato che sarebbe stato fantastico dare alle persone qualcosa per rendere la vita più facile, qualcosa che prima non avevano e che non potevano fare.</p>
<p>E se potessi semplicemente entrare in contatto con i tuoi connazionali all'estero? E se i concittadini che sono stati nei tuoi panni potessero condividere le loro esperienze con te ed aiutarti?</p>
<p>Ed è così che è nato My Global Welcome.</p>
<p>My Global Welcome soddisfa i nostri bisogni più umani di relazione, certezza e supporto all'estero. E' il primo social network a livello internazionale che ti connette con i tuoi connazionali in tutto il mondo.</p>
<p>Ti fa sentire a casa e ti offre una calda accoglienza dovunque andrai, perché i connazionali all'estero non solo parlano la tua lingua, sono affidabili, una fonte di informazioni in prima persona e sul campo se hai bisogno di spostarti in giro per il mondo. Hanno le conoscenze, possono darti consigli e aiuto pratico in qualsiasi zona e situazione ti troverai.</p>
<p>E soprattutto ti impediscono di sentirti perso e solo all'estero.</p>
<p>Questo è ciò di cui tratta My Global Welcome ed il motivo per cui voglio creare questo social network ... e ho la squadra giusta per farlo.</p>
<p>Ma adesso abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto per costruire My Global Welcome, per farlo conoscere al mondo e far crescere la comunità. Lavoriamo insieme per fare diventare My Global Welcome veramente grande e, insieme, possiamo rendere questo mondo più piccolo e più accogliente.</p>
<p>Se anche a te piace l'idea di sentirti a casa ovunque vai e se credi che questo possa renderti la vita più facile, dunque mostra il tuo sostegno per My Global Welcome. Non perderti questa irripetibile occasione per far parte di qualcosa di veramente fantastico, e soprattutto scrivetemi a <a href=""mailto:info@myglobalwelcome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@myglobalwelcome.com</a> per darmi idee e riscontri di ogni genere. </p>
<p>Con affetto,</p>
<p>Michaela (CEO &amp; Founder di My Global Welcome) </p>

</p>
<p>My
Global Welcome: Sentirsi a casa ovunque andrai</p>
<p>
Questo è Tom, Mary, e Michael.</p>
<p>
Vogliono trasferirsi in un altro paese. Per
farlo, hanno bisogno di trovare una casa e una scuola per Tom, aprire
un conto in banca, ottenere un'assicurazione sanitaria, sostituire la
loro patente di guida e presentare la domanda per il permesso di
soggiorno.</p>
<p>
Prima di trasferirsi inviano una email alle
autorità nel nuovo paese per l'assistenza ma la comunicazione è
pressoché impossibile a causa della barriera linguistica.</p>
<p>Quindi
– a chi potrebbero rivolgersi per avere informazioni e
un'assistenza funzionale?</p>
<p>
Questo è Peter.</p>
<p>
Spesso deve recarsi all'estero per lavoro.
Prima di partire per un viaggio ha bisogno di trovare un hotel e
capire come funzionano le infrastrutture di un altro paese.</p>
<p>Al
fine di essere adeguatamente preparato, investe sempre un sacco di
energia, tempo e denaro - ma non riesce a sentirsi a proprio agio
dato che non conosce le differenze culturali del paese dove sta
andando e, di conseguenza, gli importanti affari commerciali non
vanno in porto.</p>
<p>
Allora, a chi potrebbe rivolgersi per un
consiglio?</p>
<p>
Questa è Olivia. Lei ama viaggiare da sola in
paesi stranieri ma, prima di partire, ha bisogno di sapere se la
destinazione è sicura e come evitare situazioni rischiose una volta
arrivata.</p>
<p>
Per questo motivo, cerca informazioni su
Internet e legge le guide turistiche ma, quando  è in giro per il
mondo da sola, spesso si sente persa, insicura e sola.</p>
<p>
Allora a chi può rivolgersi per assistenza?</p>
<p>
Non sarebbe fantastico se Mary e Michael
potessero semplicemente mettersi in contatto con connazionali già
presenti nel nuovo paese che potrebbero aiutarli a trasferirsi senza
problemi, e a sentirsi come a casa?</p>
<p>
E se Peter potesse semplicemente rivolgersi a
concittadini all'estero che potrebbero dargli consigli su come
chiudere un affare con successo?</p>
<p>
E se Olivia potesse semplicemente fare
affidamento su connazionali, in tutto il mondo, che potrebbero
offrirle un caldo benvenuto e una mano in qualsiasi paese straniero
si trovi?</p>
<p>
Ecco che abbiamo fantastiche notizie per voi:
My Global Welcome è il primo social network al mondo che ti fa
sentire sempre a casa dovunque andrai.</p>
<h3><b>Come funziona My Global Welcome?</b></h3>
<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466347902/mock-up_prima_pagina_tuoxb1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>
(Prima pagina di My Global Welcome)</i></p>
<p>
È facile e divertente da usare. Nel mio caso,
io sono tedesca e se ho bisogno di informazioni da altri connazionali
tedeschi a Udine, Italia, semplicemente seleziono prima la
nazionalità dei miei connazionali (nel mio caso i tedeschi), poi il
paese (nel mio caso l'Italia), e infine la città (nel mio caso
Udine). 
</p>
<p>
Poi potrai scegliere il motivo per cui desideri
contattare i tuoi connazionali all'estero. Vuoi informazioni
affidabili, da fonte diretta, prima di iniziare il viaggio o prima di
partire; vuoi un incontro o chattare online; hai bisogno di
assistenza linguistica quando arrivi in un paese straniero;
hai bisogno di spostarti con i tuoi figli; volete che qualcuno vi
spedisca un articolo dall'estero; hai bisogno di un passaggio o di un
alloggio in un paese straniero; vorresti mangiare a casa con
qualcuno; state cercando una guida per una gita fuori-porta o in
città o ti serve che qualcuno organizzi un evento per te nel paese
dove andrai?</p>
<p>
Poi clicchi su ""cerca compatrioti"" e
vai alla seconda pagina.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466348269/mock-up_seconda_pagina_tbphpm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
<i>(Seconda pagina di My Global Welcome)</i></p>
<p>
Dal momento che My Global Welcome utilizza la
geo-localizzazione, sarai immediatamente messo in contatto con un
paio di connazionali che corrispondono alla tua selezione, qui per
esempio i tedeschi che vivono a Udine e che sono a disposizione per
incontrare e chiacchierare o per assistenza linguistica. Scegli la
persona che desideri conoscere e clicca sul pulsante ""contatto"",
che ti porta alla terza pagina.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466348400/mock-up_terza_pagina_ehgezl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 633.6px;height: 653px;""/></p>
<p>
<i>(Terza pagina di My Global Welcome)</i></p>
<p>
Qui potrai ricevere informazioni sui tuoi
connazionali, di dove sono, quando e perché si sono trasferiti, come
si guadagnano da vivere, i loro hobby e interessi e quello che gli
piace di più circa la loro nuova vita. Solo se sceglierai di
contattarli, ti verrà chiesto di effettuare il login. Vuoi vedere
prima altri connazionali? Nessun problema. Sono indicati in
basso. Dopo il log-in, sarai in grado di contattare i tuoi
compatrioti personalmente e ottenere assistenza in tutto il mondo per
qualsiasi problema tu possa avere.</p>

<h3><b>My Global Welcome è anche per dispositivi mobili?</b></h3>
<div>
<p>Se
sei uno che gira per il mondo, avrai sicuramente bisogno di loro.
Questo è come appariranno:</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466348678/mock-up_app_gxabjz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/><h3><b>Quanto costerà My Global Welcome e perché abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto?</b></h3>
<p>Per
la creazione di My Global Welcome e dei suoi dispositivi mobili (per
smartphone e tablet) abbiamo bisogno di $20,000 (= costi di
ammortamento). Poi avremo altre spese, come ad esempio
amministrative, consumi, finanziarie, di gestione e in particolare i
costi di marketing e PR.</p>Ecco un'analisi dei nostri costi totali per il primo anno di My Global Welcome:<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466352100/Screen_Shot_2016-06-19_at_17.59.51_grijr5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>Questo è il motivo per cui il vostro aiuto è
assolutamente fondamentale. Più soldi raccogliamo, tanto più
possiamo investire nei servizi di marketing e PR in tutto il mondo,
così che My Global Welcome sarà disponibile il più rapidamente
possibile per voi... ovunque andiate.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Vi ricordiamo che è possibile donare sia tramite PayPal che CARTA DI CREDITO. Vi basterà cliccare sul tasto in alto a destra ""BACK IT"" o, ancora meglio, direttamente sulla ricompensa. Vi si aprirà una pagina in cui inserire i vostri dati, poi cliccate su ""CONTINUE TO PAYPAL"". A questo punto potrete scegliere se pagare con PayPal (""Login to your Paypal account"") o se pagare con CARTA DI CREDITO (""Pay with a credit or debit card""). Tranquilli, è più facile di quanto sembri!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>A questo punto, vorremmo fare un ringraziamento
speciale a Hans Stadtmüller, Fritz Kustatscher e Michael Schlemm, i
nostri primi investitori, convinti che My Global Welcome cambierà
veramente la vostra vita in meglio.<br/></p>

IMAGINE MAKING HISTORY. Imagine being able to tell your kids that you were amongst the founding members of MY GLOBAL WELCOME. 












What is My Global Welcome about?


You want to travel for business or a holiday, or to move to another country, but there’s something holding you back…  that scared and anxious feeling in your stomach.  
Well, you’re not alone. Even if  I’m well prepared, there are still many worries and doubts. Will I deal with the foreign language? Will I miss my home? Will I feel homesick? Who can I turn to in case of need? And so on and so on. 

Traveling and moving abroad are amazing experiences but this is why many people end up doing nothing and never leave the places they are comfortable with. 
So how can this problem be solved? How can we stay calm abroad? 
The answer is simple: If we know BEFORE travelling that we’ll receive a warm welcome and a helping hand from people who speak our own language and who are already living in the country we’re travelling to.
And this is what My Global Welcome is about.

It is the WORLD’S FIRST SOCIAL NETWORK that eliminates the language problem before and while we’re moving in the world because it connects us with our fellow countrymen abroad who can help us with whatever problem we’ll have.


The New York Journal calls My Global Welcome the TRAVEL REVOLUTION. For sure it is, even if we are still completely overwhelmed by the massive media coverage we already received before the launch of our campaign. 


We are thrilled, but hey guys, this time it’s not anxiety, but this pure rush of adrenalin because we begin to realize that with your help, something ground-breaking starts right here and right now. 


If you, too, like the idea of feeling at home wherever you go and if you believe that this can make our life easier, then please show your support for My Global Welcome. Don't miss out this once in a lifetime opportunity to make part of something truly great. And most importantly, please contact me at info@myglobalwelcome.com to provide ideas and feedback. Love, Michaela (CEO & Founder of My Global Welcome)


Which of your problems does My Global Welcome solve?








How does My Global Welcome work?




(first page of My Global Welcome)


It’s easy and fun to use. In my case, I’m German and if I need information from other fellow German countrymen in Udine, Italy, for example, I simply first select the nationality of my fellow countrymen (in my case Germans), then the country (in my case Italy), and then the city (in my case Udine). 
Then you choose why you would like to contact your fellow countrymen abroad. Is it for reliable, firsthand information before you start travelling or before you move? Do you want to meet or chat online? Do you need language assistance when you get in a foreign country? Do you need to move with your kids? Would you like for somebody to send you an item from abroad? Do you need a ride or accommodation in a foreign country? Would you like to eat at home with some company? Are you looking for a city or outdoor guide or would you like that somebody organizes an event for you in the country you're travelling to? 
Then you click on ""search compatrios"" and it will take you to the second page.



(second page of My Global Welcome)



Since My Global Welcome uses geolocation, it will immediately come up with a couple of fellow countrymen that match your selection, here, for example, Germans that live in Udine and that are available to meet and chat or for language assistance. You choose the person you'd like to get to know, then click on the ""contact"" button which takes you to the third page.

(third page of My Global Welcome)
Here you'll receive information on your fellow countrymen, where they are from, when and why they moved, their occupation, their hobbies and interests and what they like most about their new life. Only if you choose to contact them, will you be asked to log in at this point. Want to see other fellow countrymen first? No problem. They are shown underneath. After logging in, you will be able to contact your compatriots personally, and get assistance worldwide for whatever problem you might have.


What about My Global Welcome on mobile devices?

If you are moving around the world, you will most definitely need access to My Global Welcome on a mobile device. This is how they will look like:




                                  


How much will My Global Welcome cost, and why do we need your help?


For the creation of My Global Welcome and My Global Welcome for mobile devices (e.g. smartphone and tablet) we need $ 20.000.
Additional expenses include: administrative, consumption, financial, management and particularly marketing and PR costs for year 1. 
This is how the costs break down:



              


This is why your help is absolutely fundamental. The more money we raise, the more we can invest in marketing and PR worldwide, and My Global Welcome will be available to use sooner, wherever you go. 
Please note that contributions are possible both via paypal OR CREDIT CARD. To contribute via direct credit card, just click on the ""BACK IT"" button on the top-right of this page or, better yet, click on a perk :-) On the second page, insert your details and click on ""CONTINUE TO PAYPAL"".  On the third page, it says ""Login to your Paypal account"" OR ""Pay with a credit or debit card"". It's really easy!
At this point, we would like to especially thank Hans Stadtmüller, Fritz Kustatscher and Michael Schlemm, our early investors, who were convinced that My Global Welcome will genuinely alter your life for the better.



What will you get in return?





We have carefully selected many unique and catchy rewards and we're sure that there is something for you, whether you prefer the world to say hello to you in your own home or if you like to travel around the world, whether you are a backer or a sponsor. 




What about our PERSONALIZED Munich Oktoberfest postcard that brings the world’s biggest festival right back into your home? Well, here you are with our “Oktoberfest” reward - but hurry up, our EARLY BIRD PRICE is limited to 30 postcards! 
Do you want to know how to travel on a budget? We know it and with our “Snoopy Traveler” packet we share our knowledge with you. Again, this is a LIMITED EARLY BIRD PRICE. So what are you waiting for? 
Still not enough? Then what about our “How to travel on a budget with kids” guide? Or a customized itinerary in Europe? The USA? The world is just enough? Include your budget?

IMMAGINA DI POTER FAR PARTE DELLA STORIA. Immagina di poter dire ai tuoi figli che sei stato tra i membri fondatori di MY GLOBAL WELCOME.







Cos'è My Global Welcome?

Ciao,
il mio nome è Michaela e negli ultimi 20 anni ho lavorato nel settore lingue e comunicazione, con persone provenienti da tutto il mondo.
Dunque, io sono tedesca e mi sono trasferita in Italia diversi anni fa. Ho subito scoperto a mie spese che trasferirsi da un paese all'altro in realtà non è lo stesso che spostarsi dietro l'angolo. Se dovete avere a che fare con un nuovo paese, tutta la familiarità smette di esistere.
Prima di tutto, mi sono resa conto che il mio paese ospitante aveva totalmente diverse tradizioni e valori sociali. Per non parlare della diversa cultura!
In secondo luogo, ho dovuto affrontare gli aspetti pratici della vita di ogni giorno, come ad esempio la logistica del trasferimento, i visti, la residenza, l'alloggio, la sanità, la contabilità, l'occupazione, i trasporti e così via.
E last-but-not-least la lingua. Vi posso assicurare che è davvero difficile affrontare con successo i problemi di tutti i giorni in una lingua straniera.
Ovviamente ho anche fatto qualche errore piuttosto imbarazzante, poiché non vi è alcun manuale di istruzioni su come fare i conti con un nuovo paese.
Poi ho capito che i miei problemi erano gli stessi che avevano altre persone. Non importa se le persone viaggiano per affari o per vacanza, o se si trasferiscono in un nuovo paese, è sempre una grande sfida e, a volte, anche un incubo logistico ed emotivo affrontare un ambiente non familiare, una nuova lingua e una nuova cultura.
A questo punto, ho pensato che sarebbe stato fantastico dare alle persone qualcosa per rendere la vita più facile, qualcosa che prima non avevano e che non potevano fare.
E se potessi semplicemente entrare in contatto con i tuoi connazionali all'estero? E se i concittadini che sono stati nei tuoi panni potessero condividere le loro esperienze con te ed aiutarti?
Ed è così che è nato My Global Welcome.
My Global Welcome soddisfa i nostri bisogni più umani di relazione, certezza e supporto all'estero. E' il primo social network a livello internazionale che ti connette con i tuoi connazionali in tutto il mondo.
Ti fa sentire a casa e ti offre una calda accoglienza dovunque andrai, perché i connazionali all'estero non solo parlano la tua lingua, sono affidabili, una fonte di informazioni in prima persona e sul campo se hai bisogno di spostarti in giro per il mondo. Hanno le conoscenze, possono darti consigli e aiuto pratico in qualsiasi zona e situazione ti troverai.
E soprattutto ti impediscono di sentirti perso e solo all'estero.
Questo è ciò di cui tratta My Global Welcome ed il motivo per cui voglio creare questo social network ... e ho la squadra giusta per farlo.
Ma adesso abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto per costruire My Global Welcome, per farlo conoscere al mondo e far crescere la comunità. Lavoriamo insieme per fare diventare My Global Welcome veramente grande e, insieme, possiamo rendere questo mondo più piccolo e più accogliente.
Se anche a te piace l'idea di sentirti a casa ovunque vai e se credi che questo possa renderti la vita più facile, dunque mostra il tuo sostegno per My Global Welcome. Non perderti questa irripetibile occasione per far parte di qualcosa di veramente fantastico, e soprattutto scrivetemi a info@myglobalwelcome.com per darmi idee e riscontri di ogni genere. 
Con affetto,
Michaela (CEO & Founder di My Global Welcome) 


Quali problemi ti risolve My Global Welcome?






My
Global Welcome: Sentirsi a casa ovunque andrai

Questo è Tom, Mary, e Michael.

Vogliono trasferirsi in un altro paese. Per
farlo, hanno bisogno di trovare una casa e una scuola per Tom, aprire
un conto in banca, ottenere un'assicurazione sanitaria, sostituire la
loro patente di guida e presentare la domanda per il permesso di
soggiorno.

Prima di trasferirsi inviano una email alle
autorità nel nuovo paese per l'assistenza ma la comunicazione è
pressoché impossibile a causa della barriera linguistica.
Quindi
– a chi potrebbero rivolgersi per avere informazioni e
un'assistenza funzionale?

Questo è Peter.

Spesso deve recarsi all'estero per lavoro.
Prima di partire per un viaggio ha bisogno di trovare un hotel e
capire come funzionano le infrastrutture di un altro paese.
Al
fine di essere adeguatamente preparato, investe sempre un sacco di
energia, tempo e denaro - ma non riesce a sentirsi a proprio agio
dato che non conosce le differenze culturali del paese dove sta
andando e, di conseguenza, gli importanti affari commerciali non
vanno in porto.

Allora, a chi potrebbe rivolgersi per un
consiglio?

Questa è Olivia. Lei ama viaggiare da sola in
paesi stranieri ma, prima di partire, ha bisogno di sapere se la
destinazione è sicura e come evitare situazioni rischiose una volta
arrivata.

Per questo motivo, cerca informazioni su
Internet e legge le guide turistiche ma, quando  è in giro per il
mondo da sola, spesso si sente persa, insicura e sola.

Allora a chi può rivolgersi per assistenza?

Non sarebbe fantastico se Mary e Michael
potessero semplicemente mettersi in contatto con connazionali già
presenti nel nuovo paese che potrebbero aiutarli a trasferirsi senza
problemi, e a sentirsi come a casa?

E se Peter potesse semplicemente rivolgersi a
concittadini all'estero che potrebbero dargli consigli su come
chiudere un affare con successo?

E se Olivia potesse semplicemente fare
affidamento su connazionali, in tutto il mondo, che potrebbero
offrirle un caldo benvenuto e una mano in qualsiasi paese straniero
si trovi?

Ecco che abbiamo fantastiche notizie per voi:
My Global Welcome è il primo social network al mondo che ti fa
sentire sempre a casa dovunque andrai.
Come funziona My Global Welcome?



(Prima pagina di My Global Welcome)

È facile e divertente da usare. Nel mio caso,
io sono tedesca e se ho bisogno di informazioni da altri connazionali
tedeschi a Udine, Italia, semplicemente seleziono prima la
nazionalità dei miei connazionali (nel mio caso i tedeschi), poi il
paese (nel mio caso l'Italia), e infine la città (nel mio caso
Udine). 


Poi potrai scegliere il motivo per cui desideri
contattare i tuoi connazionali all'estero. Vuoi informazioni
affidabili, da fonte diretta, prima di iniziare il viaggio o prima di
partire; vuoi un incontro o chattare online; hai bisogno di
assistenza linguistica quando arrivi in un paese straniero;
hai bisogno di spostarti con i tuoi figli; volete che qualcuno vi
spedisca un articolo dall'estero; hai bisogno di un passaggio o di un
alloggio in un paese straniero; vorresti mangiare a casa con
qualcuno; state cercando una guida per una gita fuori-porta o in
città o ti serve che qualcuno organizzi un evento per te nel paese
dove andrai?

Poi clicchi su ""cerca compatrioti"" e
vai alla seconda pagina.



(Seconda pagina di My Global Welcome)

Dal momento che My Global Welcome utilizza la
geo-localizzazione, sarai immediatamente messo in contatto con un
paio di connazionali che corrispondono alla tua selezione, qui per
esempio i tedeschi che vivono a Udine e che sono a disposizione per
incontrare e chiacchierare o per assistenza linguistica. Scegli la
persona che desideri conoscere e clicca sul pulsante ""contatto"",
che ti porta alla terza pagina.




(Terza pagina di My Global Welcome)

Qui potrai ricevere informazioni sui tuoi
connazionali, di dove sono, quando e perché si sono trasferiti, come
si guadagnano da vivere, i loro hobby e interessi e quello che gli
piace di più circa la loro nuova vita. Solo se sceglierai di
contattarli, ti verrà chiesto di effettuare il login. Vuoi vedere
prima altri connazionali? Nessun problema. Sono indicati in
basso. Dopo il log-in, sarai in grado di contattare i tuoi
compatrioti personalmente e ottenere assistenza in tutto il mondo per
qualsiasi problema tu possa avere.

My Global Welcome è anche per dispositivi mobili?

Se
sei uno che gira per il mondo, avrai sicuramente bisogno di loro.
Questo è come appariranno:



                                    
Quanto costerà My Global Welcome e perché abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto?
Per
la creazione di My Global Welcome e dei suoi dispositivi mobili (per
smartphone e tablet) abbiamo bisogno di $20,000 (= costi di
ammortamento). Poi avremo altre spese, come ad esempio
amministrative, consumi, finanziarie, di gestione e in particolare i
costi di marketing e PR.Ecco un'analisi dei nostri costi totali per il primo anno di My Global Welcome:





Questo è il motivo per cui il vostro aiuto è
assolutamente fondamentale. Più soldi raccogliamo, tanto più
possiamo investire nei servizi di marketing e PR in tutto il mondo,
così che My Global Welcome sarà disponibile il più rapidamente
possibile per voi... ovunque andiate.


Vi ricordiamo che è possibile donare sia tramite PayPal che CARTA DI CREDITO. Vi basterà cliccare sul tasto in alto a destra ""BACK IT"" o, ancora meglio, direttamente sulla ricompensa. Vi si aprirà una pagina in cui inserire i vostri dati, poi cliccate su ""CONTINUE TO PAYPAL"". A questo punto potrete scegliere se pagare con PayPal (""Login to your Paypal account"") o se pagare con CARTA DI CREDITO (""Pay with a credit or debit card""). Tranquilli, è più facile di quanto sembri!


A questo punto, vorremmo fare un ringraziamento
speciale a Hans Stadtmüller, Fritz Kustatscher e Michael Schlemm, i
nostri primi investitori, convinti che My Global Welcome cambierà
veramente la vostra vita in meglio.


Cosa otterrete in cambio?


Abbiamo accuratamente selezionato molte
incredibili ricompense e siamo sicuri che c'è qualcosa per ognuno
voi, non importa se ti piace girare per il mondo o se
preferisci che il mondo ti saluti mentre sei comodamente a casa
tua.

direttamente a casa tua? Be', ecco la nostra ricompensa ""Oktoberfest""
- ma sbrigati, il nostro PREZZO EARLY BIRD è limitato a 30 cartoline!

il nostro pacchetto ""Snoopy Traveler"" condividiamo la
nostra conoscenza con te. Anche in questo caso, si tratta di un
numero limitato di PREZZO EARLY BIRD. Allora, cosa stai aspettando? 





Non

ne dici della nostra guida  ""Come viaggiare low-cost con i
bambini""? O un itinerario personalizzato in Europa? Gli Stati
Uniti? Il mondo ti basta? Hai
un budget? Nessun problema – ecco

O preferisci cercare ""esperienze che i soldi non possono comprare""? Un corso di lingua personalizzato
in base alle tue esigenze? Una chiamata dalla nostra CEO? Una cena con la nostra CEO per un'esclusiva dietro le quinte di My Global Welcome?
O scoprire i luoghi più belli del Friuli Venezia Giulia, gemma
nascosta d'Italia, con le sue belle regioni del vino  come descritte
nella guida Lonely Planet 2016?

Qualunque sia la scelta, tieni a mente che la
ciliegina sulla torta sarà il World's First Social Network (il primo
social network del mondo) che ti connette con i tuoi connazionali in
tutto il mondo, e ti offre assistenza e supporto nella tua lingua,
ovunque tu sia. E tu ne sei parte!

Qual è il team dietro a My Global Welcome?

più difficile, dopo tutto. Ma ora, eccoci qui.

</div></div>","The Problem
 People are social by nature.  This is a good thing, but it has its own share of problems.  Security, privacy, and confidentiality are issues that we all need to deal with when meeting others.  More often than not, this hinders our ability to connect with people that we meet face to face.

  Introducing ""Nice To Meet You!"" - An App That Takes the Pain Out of Connecting
 When you download and use ""Nice To Meet You!""

You no longer have to share your contact information to connect and communicate...
You will never have to worry about giving out your phone number too soon...
You decide WHEN you want to share your contact details...
You gain access to truly private instant messaging - without irritating and bothersome ads...

""Nice To Meet You!"" allows you to connect and communicate with people you meet face to face WITHOUT disclosing any contact information.






     Accept/Decline.  No contact information is given!Only your first name, profile picture, when you met and a map of where you met are displayed to the other user.  Nothing else!


     Who, when, and where you met... it's that simple!The app enables you to communicate via private instant messaging.  You can share your personal contact information IF and WHEN you're comfortable.



         Clean user interface and absolutely NO ads!In addition, ""Nice To Meet You!"" will NEVER have any user-driven, annoying and intrusive ads.  We've gone the extra mile and taken things up a notch to reassure you that your content is TRULY PRIVATE.
You also have the option of deleting the Connection, so that the user never gets hold of you in the future, however hard they may try!

  My Story
 Having worked in the tech industry since 2001, I've spent the last 2 YEARS perfecting ""Nice To Meet You!""  Tireless days, sleepless nights and SEVERAL HUNDRED bug fixes later, I'm pleased to announce we officially launched this app, for iOS and Android, on December 13th, 2014.

  Announcing an Awesome Feature:  Temporary Messaging That is Both Instant and Private
  With this feature, instant messages only last 3 days in the app.  On the current day, message looks normal.  When the message is 1 day old, it turns gray.  When the message is 2 days old, it turns black.  When the message is 3 days old, it is COMPLETELY black.  Poof!

    See how the message that is older than 3 days               is completely BLACK!  Cool huh?
  What We Need From You
 Your help and support will transform our cool concept into something BIGGER!  Your support will enable us to add additional features and app enhancements.  More importantly, your support will empower us to generate awareness about the app - worldwide!  More people need to find out that there's a more private way to connect and communicate.

<h1>Docking Station / Smoke - Gas Sensor and App</h1>
<div>
<p>You are asleep, your phone is in its dock beside your bed, and deadly cool toxic smoke from a smoldering fire starts slowly filling your room. Traditional ionization ceiling mounted smoke alarms work well for fast fires but can take around 20 minutes or more to detect this cool smoke by which time you may not wake up.</p>
<div>This is where <strong>Sense+</strong> technology could save you and house hold members. The Sense+ is the first ever portable smart device docking station and charger with built in Photo Electric smoke and gas detection sensors. The Sense+ also ‘talks’ to a smart App on your phone offering unique personal protection options.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.studio-tonic.com/images/Indiegogo/Sense+_Image1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>‘Photo-Electric’ smoke sensors are the latest (and in most cases the best) smoke detectors available. They can detect deadly cold smoke that some traditional smoke alarms have difficulty sensing. By combining the photoelectric sensor with a carbon monoxide (the gas that makes you too sleepy to wake up) sensor you get secondary technology as a backup which may work better depending on the nature of the threat.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>If smoke is detected, an alert will sound and the Sense+ App will start up on the iPhone. If there is no response, an alarm will sound and the app on your phone will call numbers listed in your home call group. An alert screen offering emergency services will then be displayed.</p>
The Sense+ draws its power from the grid (mains power) or the docked smart device. If these are not available it also has a built-in battery as a backup.</div>

<p>Sense+ is intended as an additional level of protection to ‘in-house’ smoke alarms and is intended to help provide sufficient advance warning to allow you to react and potentially save your life and the lives of those around you. Worldwide there are over 195,000 fire related deaths1 every year and an unspecified number related to carbon monoxide poisoning plus hundreds of thousands of people injured in such events. In the U.S. alone one, person is killed in a fire every 169 minutes and someone is injured every 30 seconds (Karter 2011). </p>
<ul>
<li> About 85% of all U.S. fire deaths in 2009 occurred in homes (Karter 2011).</li>
<li> In 2010, fire departments responded to 384,000 home fires in the United States, which claimed the lives of 2,640 people (not including firefighters) and injured another 13,350, not including firefighters (Karter 2011). </li>
<li>The total costs of injuries to the U.S. economy, $7.5 billion (2006) each year. </li>
<li>Most victims of fires die from smoke or toxic gases and not from burns (Hall 2001). </li>
<li>Over one-third (37%) home fire deaths occur in homes without smoke alarms (Ahrens 2011).</li>
</ul>
<p>Most households have smoke alarms but many of them aren't in working order, usually due to flat batteries or batteries having been removed. A device such as Sense+ in a household may help to prevent many of these deaths. </p>
<p>The team behind the Sense+ were inspired after reading several media reports of multiple tragedies and near misses in fires where no working smoke alarms were installed in the home/hotel/cabin... Smoke inhalation meant the occupants were unable to wake up and get themselves and their families to safety. By studying Smart phone owners habits the team came up with the idea of combining an everyday personal item such as a mobile phone (often placed beside the users bed) with a smart smoke and gas warning system. </p>
<p>The Sense+ is designed for use with Apple’s iPhone5. However other smart devices can connect via a USB port. Future versions are planned to be native for Android and Windows phones. This is simply a matter of swapping the inner core module with one for your type of phone/device. Designed to be portable, the Sense+ is a great travel charger and smoke/gas sensor. </p>

<h3>Why we all need DeckTracker?</h3>
<p>Have you ever had that sick feeling when something important to
you goes missing at the absolute worst time?</p>
<p>We have.</p>
<p>Trey Van Cleave left his deck in a hotel room, knocking him out
of a tournament. His opportunity to be a full-time magic dealer was gone in the
blink of an eye when his suitcase, containing his entire collection, was
stolen.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Andrew Prell had his modern deck stolen on day two of GP Richmond
just before the final round.<span>  He had ten minutes to find or rebuild his deck; needless to say, that was stressful.</span></p>
<p>We don't want this to ever happen to you.</p>
<p>After researching existing Bluetooth tracking technology, we
realized nothing on the market would have prevented these losses.</p>
<p>DeckTracker does.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>DeckTracker is a Bluetooth Device that is designed to alert you
if the device is moved more than 20 feet away from your phone.<span>  It will set off an alarm on your phone and
you can use the map software to pinpoint the location of the device. Then, when
you are close enough to hear it, you can set off the alarm on the device. It's that
simple!</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/768778/files/20140805152941-either_or.png?1407277781"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why choose DeckTracker?</h3>
<h4>1: The 20ft (6 meters) Virtual Leash.</h4>
<p>Unlike other tracking devices, DeckTracker will alert you before
it's too late. Other trackers help you locate things you already know are lost,
or alert you when they move over 100 feet away. By then your deck is long gone. DeckTracker helps prevent loss from happening by providing a 20 foot virtual leash
between the device and your phone. </p><p>If you are in this picture, DeckTracker alerts you before it makes it to the end of the table. Other trackers won't alert you until your deck is in the parking lot.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/715270/files/20140713200233-tourny2.jpg?1405306953"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic;"">When do you want to know?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"">2: The Design</span><br/></p>

<p></p></div>","Why we all need DeckTracker?
Have you ever had that sick feeling when something important to
you goes missing at the absolute worst time?
We have.
Trey Van Cleave left his deck in a hotel room, knocking him out
of a tournament. His opportunity to be a full-time magic dealer was gone in the
blink of an eye when his suitcase, containing his entire collection, was
stolen.  
Andrew Prell had his modern deck stolen on day two of GP Richmond
just before the final round.  He had ten minutes to find or rebuild his deck; needless to say, that was stressful.
We don't want this to ever happen to you.
After researching existing Bluetooth tracking technology, we
realized nothing on the market would have prevented these losses.
DeckTracker does.

How does it work?
DeckTracker is a Bluetooth Device that is designed to alert you
if the device is moved more than 20 feet away from your phone.  It will set off an alarm on your phone and
you can use the map software to pinpoint the location of the device. Then, when
you are close enough to hear it, you can set off the alarm on the device. It's that
simple!

Why choose DeckTracker?
1: The 20ft (6 meters) Virtual Leash.
Unlike other tracking devices, DeckTracker will alert you before
it's too late. Other trackers help you locate things you already know are lost,
or alert you when they move over 100 feet away. By then your deck is long gone. DeckTracker helps prevent loss from happening by providing a 20 foot virtual leash
between the device and your phone. If you are in this picture, DeckTracker alerts you before it makes it to the end of the table. Other trackers won't alert you until your deck is in the parking lot.When do you want to know?2: The Design
The size and shape of DeckTracker have been customized for the card gaming community. For this reason, we avoided using sharp edges or bright colors.DeckTracker is an anti-theft device, it was designed to be hidden inside a deck box or binder. We wanted DeckTracker to be discrete so we made it black. Because cards can easily be dented by sharp edges, we shaped it to minimize any potential damage to your magic cards. The final design fits perfectly inside the bottom of a standard deck box and slips easily into the page of a trade binder.
          If you dislike binder dents....                     You will hate other trackers!
3: The Device Alarm
Because the device is meant to go inside deck
boxes and trade binders, we have worked with our manufacturer to make the device alarm louder
than other trackers so it can be heard in the MTG tournament environment.  DeckTracker is flat and smaller than the bottom of any standard deck box.FAQ'sHow many DeckTrackers can 1 Smartphone find?
We recommend using no more than 10 trackers
at the same time on an iPhone and 4 on an Android device.

Will DeckTracker work with my phone?:

<h3>The Inspiration:</h3>
<p>While shooting some quick test shots a little over a year ago for a Toyota commerical that my company would be working on, we were using a standard handle on the Canon 7D while shooting some of the closer, more intimate shots. A few days later, I noticed a friend complaining about not being able to get a decent shot with his iPhone because it was too hard to hold even remotely steady.</p>
<p>At this point, the two didn't seem connected and I didn't have a single idea in my head about creating a product. However, again a few days later I spoke with my mother who was trying to take video with her point-and-shoot. She too was having trouble capturing decent footage so I told her to get a handle or some type of mini rig she could put her camera on if she wanted to film a family gathering or an event that a family member was invovled in. </p>
<p>As most of you know, our parents generally aren't exactly in tune with the newest gadgets or technology. She asked me if I could find something for her. As it turns out, I must not be in tune with the newest gadgets or technology either. I guess I just assumed that there would be a simple, sleek and cheap product in my mother's local Best Buy store that she could conveniently carry in her pocket or purse and mount her camera on it and have a blast.</p>
<p>After spending a bit of time looking for the perfect product for this I just couldn't find exactly what I was looking for. I needed something affordable, something that could be purchased by someone who isn't a filmmaker. . .a product that wasn't an investment. I also felt like I needed something that has a great design. It seemed like all new cameras have nicer and nicer designs. At this point I was thinking about  my friend with the iPhone as well. I began to think of how concious consumers are of the visual appeal of their accesories. </p>
<p>For some reason, I just couldn't find the right product. Sure there are affordable products out there but they are clunky and ugly. Even the one we were using at the beginning of this story was a big, strangely shaped, plain old ugly handle. It was functional, but it's not something that matches the design of modern cameras and smartphones. Needless to say it definitely doesn't fit in your pocket either. </p>
<p>The next week at work I had a little down time and began sketching some ideas. This is when I began thinking about what the product that I'm desperately looking for would actually look like. What features would it have? What size would it be? What shape?</p>
<p>This is where the development phase began.  </p>
<h3>The Development:</h3>
<p>The Handle Pro was quite different when it was first being created. I began making outlines and random shapes of what the top would be like. What the general shape would be like.</p>
<p>This went on in my downtime for the rest of the week. Finally after thinking about all of the details overnight I sat down and completed the first full sketch of what is now called The Handle Pro.<br/> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i765.photobucket.com/albums/xx293/IndieFilmDepot/01_FirstSketch.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that I had a complete sketch, as opposed to my previous random etches and drawings of nothing, I felt like it was time to move forward. So I grabbed some modeling clay to start playing with. I have to admit that I'm not the best with clay.</p>
<p>Regardless, this was the first clay model in brilliant orange! I thought it was great, so later that week I decided it was time to make a better clay model. Off to the store for some molding clay. . .</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i765.photobucket.com/albums/xx293/IndieFilmDepot/02_ClayModels.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Round two with clay (right). Wow this is perfect. . .time to make this thing a reality. This can't get any better. This was the first time seeing and holding a solid version. It's ready to go. Next, it was time to get this bad boy modeled in 3D and then get a 3D print as a test subject. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i765.photobucket.com/albums/xx293/IndieFilmDepot/03_3DModels.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/135601/files/20131015211958-04_3DPrint.jpg?1381897198"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After re-working some ideas, new sketches, meetings with product designers and some waiting around we went back to 3D land. There were several rounds of completely remodeling our product in 3D from scratch.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i765.photobucket.com/albums/xx293/IndieFilmDepot/05_3DWorld.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Once we finally saw a 3D render of the new version we knew that this one had to be it - this is the point we had decided to call our product The Handle Pro. A couple of weeks later we received our first working copy of The Handle Pro. Some minor adjustments were necessary. . .more waiting.</p>
<p>Finally, after about another month of slight revisions. . .perfection!<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i765.photobucket.com/albums/xx293/IndieFilmDepot/06_Final.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This donation site is hoping to raise 25,000 dollars for Dwayne Casey's fine caused by his ""blow up"" about the Officiating after the Atlanta Hawks game on January 20, 2013. Dwayne Casey is getting fined for specifically complaining about bad officiating that caused the Raptors to lose games, in which, the NBA HAS ADMITTED they screwed up!</p>
<p>I dont know about you, but the fact he is getting fined for getting upset about something the NBA actually officially agrees with (in prior games...and im sure this one will be admitted as well)....well...makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>I wanted to yell out at the media and complain about the Officiating this year many times...many, many times....however, us fans, dont really have the ability to have our voices heard by the NBA folks.</p>
<p>With that said, I fully appreciate that Dwayne Casey decided to blow up, and let the NBA know that ""enough is enough"". Apologies do not mean anything if the same mistake is made over and over again....Us, as fans, all feel this way and wish we could have spoken out about it...but unfortunately, Dwayne Casey is the only person who was able to after the Hawks game...and he got fined for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lets Help Pay this fine ...as his rant was the right thing to do...and he doesnt deserve to be punished.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All we need is 25 000 Raptors Fans to donate one dollar each...more if you want...but simply 25 000 one dollar donations can pay for his fine...so lets show him we appreciate his rant, and make our voices heard and let the NBA know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IF this site does not reach the 25000 dollar mark....everybody who made the dollar donation will be refunded ...our goal is to raise the 25, 000 in 30 - 60 days max.</p>

<h2><strong>Who we are</strong></h2>
<p>This product was devised by the creative minds of the Ugo.Design team made up of 3 industrial designers and an experienced electronics expert.</p>
<p>Carolyne Gratton and Jonathan Villeneuve are two young dynamic industrial designers that have recently graduated from the University of Montreal’s School of Industrial Design and who are taking part in this project. Experienced product developer Steve Boa, owner of AIS Innovations, is also involved as the electronic expert and taking care of prototyping, molds and sourcing for the components.</p>
<p>I have a background in industrial design from the University of Montreal’s School of Industrial Design and more than 18 years of experience, I have been involved in the development of many products for different companies. Some of which even acquired patents pending. </p>
<p>Our passion about design and our constant will to innovate drive us in finding new solutions for everyday products. Our Vision? Bringing to life product ideas that will transform and simplify your day-to-day life.  </p>
<p>-Daniel Thibault, designer and campaign leader</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Our campaign</strong></h2>
<p>Our aim is to raise money to launch our initial production of a new fun type of electronic device we’ve been developing: <strong>Ugo.</strong> This campaign is our first one and we believe that crowdfunding is a great new way to reach the end users, whom we are designing the products for. As industrial designers, we care about the human factors and user needs when involved in product development.</p>
<p>Industrial designers are always asking themselves; How?, Where?, Who?, and especially, Why? Being an industrial designer is one of the greatest and most exciting challenges. And this is a terrific product designed to answer all the above questions. Nevertheless, keeping a small design firm alive is certainly an even bigger challenge in today’s business world.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>All we need now is your help! With your money we will be able to develop optimized injection molds, get the necessary electronic components for the first production round and get you the best looking multi-functional smartphone accessory you’ve ever laid your eyes on. Encourage us by pre-ordering your <strong><em>Ugo.</em></strong><em> device</em> today, helping us to start production and launch our product on the market as soon as possible!</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We need the money for:</strong></h3>
<p>1. The production of steel injection molds to manufacture our product. The cost is estimated between 10 000 and 12 000$.  </p>
<p>2. The purchasing of a minimum quantity of 1 000 PCB (printed circuit board), wires, high quality speakers and polymer resins. Costs are estimated at about 10 000$, depending of the number of perks claimed.</p>
<p>3. The labor and freight costs related to production (injection molding, parts assembly, customization process, etc). </p>
<p>4. Taxes, exchange currency fees, Indiegogo commission, credit card and Paypal fees.</p>
<p><strong>The total estimated is $35 000</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you will get:</strong> </p>
<p>In return you will assuredly find a perk that suits your wants and needs perfectly, you have 9 awesome choices to choose from!</p>
<p>We are offering you the early adopter’s prices for the <strong>Ugo.</strong> device. The product’s suggested retail price will be <strong>95$</strong> for the ORIGINAL Ugo. version once this campaign has ended.</p>
<p>Our perks allow you to get your hands on <strong>Ugo.</strong> before everyone else, as early as July 2013. But before we can deliver <strong>Ugo.</strong> we will need between 10 to 12 weeks to produce the molds, for product testing, improvements and product assembly for perk delivery. If the campaign turns out to be a huge success before it ends we might be able to start production sooner and deliver your <strong>Ugo. </strong>device before the aforementioned dates.</p>

<h2><strong>Rappelez vous… </strong></h2>
<p>Il n'y a pas si longtemps, la musique portable se résumait à cette iconique cassette audio à bande magnétique. À ce ruban capricieux, parfois si pénible à rembobiner. Et combien de précieux temps fut perdu à essayer de trouver la chanson que nous voulions entendre?</p>
<p>Vous vous demandez sans doute où nous voulons en venir?</p>
<p>Et si nous vous annoncions qu’il est possible de revivre l’époque de vos cassettes audio adorées avec vos appareils de musique portables modernes?</p>
<p>Voici <strong>Ugo.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Notre projet                                                                        </strong></h2>
<p>Nous avons conçu et développé <strong>un support de recharge portable intégrant un haut-parleur de qualité avec technologie sans fil pour téléphones intelligents</strong> et appareils de musique portables tout en apportant une touche rétro, nous rappelant le fameux boîtier de cassette audio que nous avions tant l'habitude d'utiliser.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Qu'est-ce qui différencie Ugo.?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><strong>C'est 3 appareils en un seul qui combine un support de recharge, un haut-parleur</strong></strong><strong><strong> sans fil et une batterie d'appoint.</strong></strong></p>
<p>1.  Bénéficiez d’un son remarquable dans un format compact avec le puissant haut-parleur offrant <strong>une large bande de fréquences</strong>, pour vous procurer un son riche et plus équilibré. <strong>Ugo.</strong> vous permet d'écouter votre musique préférée tout en rechargeant votre appareil, ce que les minis haut-parleurs portables ne permettent pas.</p>
<p>2.   Équipé de la <strong>technologie Bluetooth et Airplay</strong> vous pourrez écouter et contrôler votre musique <strong>sans fil</strong> en toute liberté sans avoir à brancher votre appareil sur le boîtier.</p>
<p>3.    Avec sa pile rechargeable au lithium-ion, de grande réserve, Ugo. constitue aussi <strong>une source d'appoint</strong> pour recharger votre appareil lorsqu’aucune source électrique n'est disponible.</p>
<p>De plus, son boîtier de format compact est très pratique à transporter, peu importe où vous allez. Vous pouvez le glisser facilement dans votre sac à main, sac à dos, valise et même tout simplement dans une pochette de chemise. Enfin, Ugo.  s'avère être un excellent support pour votre téléphone intelligent, que ce soit à la verticale ou à l'horizontale pour le visionnement de vidéos.</p>
<p>Cet appareil a été conçu pour recevoir différents types de connecteurs pour téléphones intelligents: iPhone 5 (lightning), les versions antérieures 4 et 3 et le iPod Touch de la cinquième génération (connecteur avec les 30 broches). <strong>Ugo. est solide au point de pouvoir accueillir autant un iPad mini qu'un iPad.</strong> Ugo. sera aussi disponible pour d’autres appareils équipés de connexions micro USB (Blackberry, Samsung et autres téléphones intelligents récents). Vous n'aurez qu'à indiquer lequel des trois types de connecteurs vous désirez commander: <strong>lightning, 30 broches ou micro USB.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Qui nous sommes                                                         </strong></h2>
<p>Ce produit a été imaginé et conçu par les esprits créateurs de l'équipe de Ugo. composés de 3 designers industriels et d'un développeur chevronné de produits électroniques.</p>
<p>Nous croyons au travail d'équipe en silos ouverts. Nous privilégions la créativité et les défis liés au lancement de nouveaux produits originaux et innovateurs. Se faisant, cette approche nous permet de joindre l'utile à l'agréable afin de donner vie à de meilleures idées!</p>
<p>Carolyne Gratton et Jonathan Villeneuve, deux jeunes designers industriels récemment diplômés de l'École de Design Industriel de l'Université de Montréal, ont accepté de prendre part aux défis de ce projet. Steve Boa, est impliqué à titre de développeur chevronné de produits électroniques. Il assume aussi l'approvisionnement en prototypes, moules et composantes électroniques nécessaires à ce projet.</p>
<p>J'ai une formation spécialisée en design industriel acquise à l'Université de Montréal. J'ai cumulé plus de 18 ans de pratique professionnelle en étant impliqué dans le développement de plusieurs produits pour différentes compagnies. Certains d'entre eux sont en instance de brevet. </p>
<p>Notre passion pour le design d'objets et notre volonté persistante d'innover nous guide vers la création de solutions transcendantes pour les objets de notre quotidien.</p>
<p>Notre vision ? Matérialiser des idées de produits pour métamorphoser et simplifier notre quotidien.</p>
<p>- Daniel Thibault, designer et responsable de la campagne</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Notre campagne</strong></h2>
<p>Notre objectif consiste à prendre des pré-commandes, directement depuis internet via la plateforme web Indiegogo, qui nous permettrons d'amasser les fonds nécessaires pour démarrer une pré-production de cet amusant support de recharge portable avec haut-parleur que nous avons conçu: <strong>Ugo.</strong> Nous avons besoin de votre soutien dès maintenant!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

Do you remember?

When the only option you had for making your music portable was with those little rectangular plastic audio cassette tapes? How long it took to rewind them? That rebellious magnetic tape? How long it took to find that one track you wanted to listen to? 
You must be wondering what we are getting at…
What if we told it was possible to relive the glory days of your beloved cassette tapes even in this digital download age?
Well now you can: Introducing Ugo.
 
Our project
We have designed a rechargeable, portable docking charger with a powerful integrated high-quality speaker and wireless technology for your smartphones and other music devices. We’ve added a touch of nostalgic flair, bringing back the familiar audio cassette case we all used at one point in our lives.
 
What makes Ugo. different?
You get three devices in one compact package, combining a docking charger, wireless speaker and battery pack.
1. You get richer, deeper sound with Ugo.’s built in speaker. Bringing you a wider range of frequencies, allowing for higher-quality and more balanced sounds. This basically means that you are getting great sound in a compact format. You can also listen to your favorite music and charge your device at the same time, something other mini-speakers on the market don’t offer.
2. It’s equipped with built-in Bluetooth and Airplay technology featuring an auto-pairing and linking feature to ensure simple and fast setup. Making it a breeze to listen and control your music wirelessly.
3. A long lasting ion-lithium battery will help you get over your Dead battery anxiety providing an emergency power supply when needed. 
As an added bonus the ultra compact design makes it very pratical to carry around everywhere you go. It also makes the perfect docking station for your smartphone, be it in upright position or for watching videos in landscape mode (horizontal).
This device is designed to accomodate different connector: for iPhone 5 and previous iPhone models (with a 30 pin connector) and iPod Touch 5th generation (with a 30 pin connector). Also, Ugo. is really strong to support iPad mini and as well iPad. Ugo. will be also available for other devices equipped with a micro USB connector (Blackberry, Samsung and others recent smartphones).  You will only have to specify one of the 3 types of connector you own: lightning, 30 pin or micro USB. 








 
Who we are
This product was devised by the creative minds of the Ugo.Design team made up of 3 industrial designers and an experienced electronics expert.
Carolyne Gratton and Jonathan Villeneuve are two young dynamic industrial designers that have recently graduated from the University of Montreal’s School of Industrial Design and who are taking part in this project. Experienced product developer Steve Boa, owner of AIS Innovations, is also involved as the electronic expert and taking care of prototyping, molds and sourcing for the components.
I have a background in industrial design from the University of Montreal’s School of Industrial Design and more than 18 years of experience, I have been involved in the development of many products for different companies. Some of which even acquired patents pending. 
Our passion about design and our constant will to innovate drive us in finding new solutions for everyday products. Our Vision? Bringing to life product ideas that will transform and simplify your day-to-day life.  
-Daniel Thibault, designer and campaign leader
 
Our campaign
Our aim is to raise money to launch our initial production of a new fun type of electronic device we’ve been developing: Ugo. This campaign is our first one and we believe that crowdfunding is a great new way to reach the end users, whom we are designing the products for. As industrial designers, we care about the human factors and user needs when involved in product development.
Industrial designers are always asking themselves; How?, Where?, Who?, and especially, Why? Being an industrial designer is one of the greatest and most exciting challenges. And this is a terrific product designed to answer all the above questions. Nevertheless, keeping a small design firm alive is certainly an even bigger challenge in today’s business world.  
 
What We Need & What You Get
All we need now is your help! With your money we will be able to develop optimized injection molds, get the necessary electronic components for the first production round and get you the best looking multi-functional smartphone accessory you’ve ever laid your eyes on. Encourage us by pre-ordering your Ugo. device today, helping us to start production and launch our product on the market as soon as possible!
 
We need the money for:
1. The production of steel injection molds to manufacture our product. The cost is estimated between 10 000 and 12 000$.  
2. The purchasing of a minimum quantity of 1 000 PCB (printed circuit board), wires, high quality speakers and polymer resins. Costs are estimated at about 10 000$, depending of the number of perks claimed.
3. The labor and freight costs related to production (injection molding, parts assembly, customization process, etc). 
4. Taxes, exchange currency fees, Indiegogo commission, credit card and Paypal fees.
The total estimated is $35 000
 
What you will get: 
In return you will assuredly find a perk that suits your wants and needs perfectly, you have 9 awesome choices to choose from!
We are offering you the early adopter’s prices for the Ugo. device. The product’s suggested retail price will be 95$ for the ORIGINAL Ugo. version once this campaign has ended.
Our perks allow you to get your hands on Ugo. before everyone else, as early as July 2013. But before we can deliver Ugo. we will need between 10 to 12 weeks to produce the molds, for product testing, improvements and product assembly for perk delivery. If the campaign turns out to be a huge success before it ends we might be able to start production sooner and deliver your Ugo. device before the aforementioned dates.
We are sure you can find something to please you: choose from different colors, laser inscriptions and special finishes! Make sure to tell us if it is for Apple devices or others devices with micro USB connector.
 
The Perks 
1. For $10 you get A Virtual Cheer from the team at Ugo Design Team
2. For $55 (+shipping) you are pre-ordering 1 ORIGINAL Ugo. Earliest birds
3. For $65 (+shipping) you are pre-ordering 1 ORIGINAL Ugo. Early birds
4. For $70 (+shipping) you are pre-ordering 1 ORIGINAL Ugo.

 
5. For $85 (+shipping) you are pre-ordering 1 CUSTOM LASER engraved Ugo.

Rappelez vous… 
Il n'y a pas si longtemps, la musique portable se résumait à cette iconique cassette audio à bande magnétique. À ce ruban capricieux, parfois si pénible à rembobiner. Et combien de précieux temps fut perdu à essayer de trouver la chanson que nous voulions entendre?
Vous vous demandez sans doute où nous voulons en venir?
Et si nous vous annoncions qu’il est possible de revivre l’époque de vos cassettes audio adorées avec vos appareils de musique portables modernes?
Voici Ugo.
 
Notre projet                                                                        
Nous avons conçu et développé un support de recharge portable intégrant un haut-parleur de qualité avec technologie sans fil pour téléphones intelligents et appareils de musique portables tout en apportant une touche rétro, nous rappelant le fameux boîtier de cassette audio que nous avions tant l'habitude d'utiliser.
 
Qu'est-ce qui différencie Ugo.?
C'est 3 appareils en un seul qui combine un support de recharge, un haut-parleur sans fil et une batterie d'appoint.
1.  Bénéficiez d’un son remarquable dans un format compact avec le puissant haut-parleur offrant une large bande de fréquences, pour vous procurer un son riche et plus équilibré. Ugo. vous permet d'écouter votre musique préférée tout en rechargeant votre appareil, ce que les minis haut-parleurs portables ne permettent pas.
2.   Équipé de la technologie Bluetooth et Airplay vous pourrez écouter et contrôler votre musique sans fil en toute liberté sans avoir à brancher votre appareil sur le boîtier.
3.    Avec sa pile rechargeable au lithium-ion, de grande réserve, Ugo. constitue aussi une source d'appoint pour recharger votre appareil lorsqu’aucune source électrique n'est disponible.
De plus, son boîtier de format compact est très pratique à transporter, peu importe où vous allez. Vous pouvez le glisser facilement dans votre sac à main, sac à dos, valise et même tout simplement dans une pochette de chemise. Enfin, Ugo.  s'avère être un excellent support pour votre téléphone intelligent, que ce soit à la verticale ou à l'horizontale pour le visionnement de vidéos.
Cet appareil a été conçu pour recevoir différents types de connecteurs pour téléphones intelligents: iPhone 5 (lightning), les versions antérieures 4 et 3 et le iPod Touch de la cinquième génération (connecteur avec les 30 broches). Ugo. est solide au point de pouvoir accueillir autant un iPad mini qu'un iPad. Ugo. sera aussi disponible pour d’autres appareils équipés de connexions micro USB (Blackberry, Samsung et autres téléphones intelligents récents). Vous n'aurez qu'à indiquer lequel des trois types de connecteurs vous désirez commander: lightning, 30 broches ou micro USB.
 







 
Qui nous sommes                                                         
Ce produit a été imaginé et conçu par les esprits créateurs de l'équipe de Ugo. composés de 3 designers industriels et d'un développeur chevronné de produits électroniques.
Nous croyons au travail d'équipe en silos ouverts. Nous privilégions la créativité et les défis liés au lancement de nouveaux produits originaux et innovateurs. Se faisant, cette approche nous permet de joindre l'utile à l'agréable afin de donner vie à de meilleures idées!
Carolyne Gratton et Jonathan Villeneuve, deux jeunes designers industriels récemment diplômés de l'École de Design Industriel de l'Université de Montréal, ont accepté de prendre part aux défis de ce projet. Steve Boa, est impliqué à titre de développeur chevronné de produits électroniques. Il assume aussi l'approvisionnement en prototypes, moules et composantes électroniques nécessaires à ce projet.
J'ai une formation spécialisée en design industriel acquise à l'Université de Montréal. J'ai cumulé plus de 18 ans de pratique professionnelle en étant impliqué dans le développement de plusieurs produits pour différentes compagnies. Certains d'entre eux sont en instance de brevet. 
Notre passion pour le design d'objets et notre volonté persistante d'innover nous guide vers la création de solutions transcendantes pour les objets de notre quotidien.
Notre vision ? Matérialiser des idées de produits pour métamorphoser et simplifier notre quotidien.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Our <a href=""https://github.com/Unrupt/unrupt/blob/master/README.md"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unrupt prototype</a> coded initially by Tim Panton who is showing it on his iPad in the video, demonstrates that it is possible for people in a conversation to speak thoughts at the same time and not interrupt each other or lose an idea. The image shows the Unrupt prototype running on an Android phone; more detail on our <a href=""https://github.com/Unrupt/unrupt/blob/master/README.md"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Github page</a>.</p>
<p>This and the ability to maintain a continuing conversation seamlessly though intermittently, as shown in our experimental <a href=""http://coopy.verbol.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Verbol voice Studio</a>, provide us with new freedoms and reliefs by freeing our minds of clutter and stress while improving our understanding of each other. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.brianreynolds.biz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brian Reynolds</a> is a Systems Designer who, after founding and growing a software company for 20 years, has been pioneering new technology and ""living in the future"" using his prototypes, leading to a series of patented inventions. Brian's son James has been involved with Brian's inventions and is now in high tech himself in San Francisco. We are offering a commercial opportunity to open source developers to distribute Apps embodying our inventions.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p>We wish to encourage early adoption of our technology by the open source community. Open source development itself and personal use we regard as non-commercial which is free of any patent license charge, so you are welcome to start coding right away.  Our source code of the Unrupt demo is freely available and <a href=""https://github.com/steely-glint/unrupt-demo/blob/master/LICENSE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MIT licensed on public Github</a>. Brian's IP holding company Family Systems Ltd is a member of the <a href=""https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Linux Foundation</a> which also supports open source.</p>
<p>In respect of commercial deployment of Apps you develop, our Unrupt patents have granted Family Systems an exclusive right to exclude others from using our Unrupt inventions in exchange for their publication for others to learn from. We wish to share our inventions with you now at a very reasonable cost, so that you can distribute Apps embodying our inventions commercially with no royalty obligation to us. This means your development can support itself by App sales without extra hurdles, </p>
<p>Two US patents are issued and a first European patent has been granted and filed in France, Germany, and the UK. Continuations have been filed in the USA and Europe; the issued patents are listed below. We hereby promise to take no enforcement action on this family of patents against any purchaser of the Proprietor Patent License perk in this campaign from receipt of payment for the life of the patents.</p>
<p><a href=""https://patents.google.com/patent/US9087521"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">US9087521</a>  Speak while listening without missing anything</p>
<p><a href=""https://patents.google.com/patent/US9538129"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">US9538129</a>  Pause the audio from someone else while speaking</p>

<p>To distribute your Apps, the Unrupt Proprietor License perk enables a sole proprietor who may be a developer, or close to someone able to make an App, an unlimited royalty-free license locked in at early bird pricing. This applies for sale of Apps in any quantity, for the remaining life of the patents approximately 15 years.   After the early bird period, we expect pricing  to increase dramatically or bear royalties.  </p>
<p>If you create useful code and contribute it as open source on Github and Family Systems adopts it in our distribution, then users of that distribution will also be patent protected by the licenses back from <a href=""https://dev2.verbol.com/family-systems-patents/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Family Systems prior patent families</a>, and the many patents pooled by all the members of the <a href=""https://www.linuxfoundation.org/membership/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Linux Foundation</a> that are within the Linux System Definition.  This assembles for a Family Systems distribution of the Unrupt open source project the kind of patent protection available to Corporations.</p>
<p>The Linux Foundation has confirmed that our Unrupt patents fall outside of Linux and are unlikely to be included in the Linux System Definition in the foreseeable future, so our patents are not in the Linux pool. We support open source so have decided to make open source development itself free and offer this Proprietary License for distribution.</p>
<p>By accepting a Proprietor License now, you are helping the continuing expansion and maintenance of the Unrupt patent family from which we all benefit. The funds will go firstly to the attorneys and national patent offices in the USA, UK and Europe where we hold the five issued Unrupt Patents and are continuing to add to them. After that to enhancing our open source Unrupt demo, so it becomes the seed of a lot more helpful innovation.   </p>
<p>In parallel to this initiative to involve the open source community we are preparing for Corporate Licensing. We have registered the Unrupt patents on the IPwe Blockchain Patent Registry and are considering their licensing platform. It is our intention that if open source developers meet over the web and decide to form a Corporation together, then their Proprietor Licenses can be credited to a Corporate License. </p>
<p>We also wish to make it possible for open source developers who work with our software to be empowered and rewarded for assisting Corporations in technology transfer of our inventions into their existing services.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are achieving new freedoms and benefits in human communication that have to be experienced and are truly wonderful. We have pioneered in Vv Studio seamless integration of web voicechat and telephony. Vv Studio is in client server mode with a combination of three open source servers for web, voice and chat with a lot of our code to integrate them.</p>
<p>With the availability now of WebRTC the same or better results can be achieved in the browser and operate peer to peer. The development opportunity is to implement the innovations pioneered in VvStudio in peer to peer mode which is more secure and scalable, starting from the Unrupt open source demo as our seed.</p>
<p>Brian is the inventor named in the Unrupt patents.  Brian's career includes founding and growing a software company for 20 years which has since become a billion dollar enterprise. Since then Brian has been conducting R&amp;D with the help of consultants to develop and maintain prototypes and patent attorneys to write patent claims, all of whose creative excellence and hard work Brian acknowledges and is very thankful for, as it has empowered us along the way in our journey of discovery and invention,</p>
<p>These efforts achieved three families of patents which have been sold with a license back to Family Systems, our IP holding company.  Since their publication, all our earlier inventions have become widely adopted and we use them every day. For instance Google Docs for our Interactive Web Pages that we patented in 1996, WhatsApp voice messaging as a primitive form of voicechat which we patented in our Web Collaboration family in 2002 and pioneered in Vv Studio, and Chordify for play-along also patented in 2002. </p>
<p>It seems that the world inevitably catches up with our inventions but after typically a 15 year wait. The results are sold by Corporations who implement their services on open source components, but the open source programmers who volunteer their effort and excellence do not always get a share of that revenue.</p>
<p>The Unrupt patents for enhanced conferencing are our fourth and most recent patent family, and build on the insights derived from using implementations of our earlier inventions. The Unrupt inventions are so new, fundamental, widely applicable and far-reaching that we have decided to license the patents instead of selling. This time we also want to accelerate the process of adoption of the Unrupt inventions by providing business opportunities to open source developers, and make this synergistic with the big corporations.</p>
<p>Our  past contributors are all remarkably gifted and are occupied in other important projects.  We hope your talents and energy will add to what we have started in the Unrupt open source project so the inventions we have pioneered can be enjoyed in innovations delivered by your Apps. We have an open source Unrupt prototype on our github repository; here is the <a href=""https://github.com/Unrupt/unrupt/blob/master/README.md"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unrupt demo Readme page.</a> This prototype enables us to experience talking our thoughts over each other without interrupting or losing anything; ""automated politeness"", in an experimental setting so the buffering is made visible. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p>Because our inventions have never been experienced before, our challenge is to help people realise they want them. Therefore this first offering is to the open source community to create and profit from Apps embodying our inventions that can popularise the new experiences. </p>
<p>This campaign is our starting point in creating awareness. We are keeping the campaign itself short in order to move to in-demand funding so that we can keep the early bird pricing going as necessary past the maximum campaign length until sufficient momentum is achieved.</p>
<p>Our <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xf5LLFaNVRIa-bGX67v_XsYMWW4lbfdKqtzS3_iYNF4/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Roadmap</a> includes many improvements to the Unrupt demo to become more useful which can transfer into your Apps. As we create demand to draw our inventions into existing commercial services, we wish open source developers to also benefit from assisting technology transfer into Corporations.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help </h3>
<p>Our Proprietor Patent License provides the opportunity for an individual to be the proprietor of an App business with our Unrupt open source webapp to seed its development. We are happy for you to copy our webapp code into your App and improve it to work better on its platform. </p>
<p>Developers are thereby incentivized to earn from their efforts by selling great Apps embodying our inventions royalty free, so that the world can get to experience them for the first time in the open source domain. </p>
<p>While we encourage you to sell Apps through any Appstore for platforms you are competent in, we wish to stay focussed on continuing to advance our underlying unique technology by cross-platform webapp, without the distraction of specific platform considerations. We will be delighted to cooperate with holders of the Proprietary License and anticipate we can together achieve the advances depicted in our <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xf5LLFaNVRIa-bGX67v_XsYMWW4lbfdKqtzS3_iYNF4/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Roadmap</a> and enable their wide availability through your Apps and the Unrupt open source project.</p>
<p>If not a developer yourself you may know someone with the ability to create life improving Apps; if so please share. For instance Brian would like an Unrupt App to get over the problems we have with Mute and web notifications in our webapp on iOS, and to interoperate with the Phone App and would be happy to pay a dollar or more for each of his family's installs from an App Store:)</p>

For instance Google Docs for our Interactive Web Pages that we patented in 1996, WhatsApp voice messaging as a primitive form of voicechat which we patented in our Web Collaboration family in 2002 and pioneered in Vv Studio, and Chordify for play-along also patented in 2002. 
It seems that the world inevitably catches up with our inventions but after typically a 15 year wait. The results are sold by Corporations who implement their services on open source components, but the open source programmers who volunteer their effort and excellence do not always get a share of that revenue.
The Unrupt patents for enhanced conferencing are our fourth and most recent patent family, and build on the insights derived from using implementations of our earlier inventions. The Unrupt inventions are so new, fundamental, widely applicable and far-reaching that we have decided to license the patents instead of selling. This time we also want to accelerate the process of adoption of the Unrupt inventions by providing business opportunities to open source developers, and make this synergistic with the big corporations.
Our  past contributors are all remarkably gifted and are occupied in other important projects.  We hope your talents and energy will add to what we have started in the Unrupt open source project so the inventions we have pioneered can be enjoyed in innovations delivered by your Apps. We have an open source Unrupt prototype on our github repository; here is the Unrupt demo Readme page. This prototype enables us to experience talking our thoughts over each other without interrupting or losing anything; ""automated politeness"", in an experimental setting so the buffering is made visible. 
Risks & Challenges 
Because our inventions have never been experienced before, our challenge is to help people realise they want them. Therefore this first offering is to the open source community to create and profit from Apps embodying our inventions that can popularise the new experiences. 
This campaign is our starting point in creating awareness. We are keeping the campaign itself short in order to move to in-demand funding so that we can keep the early bird pricing going as necessary past the maximum campaign length until sufficient momentum is achieved.
Our Roadmap includes many improvements to the Unrupt demo to become more useful which can transfer into your Apps. As we create demand to draw our inventions into existing commercial services, we wish open source developers to also benefit from assisting technology transfer into Corporations.
Other Ways You Can Help 
Our Proprietor Patent License provides the opportunity for an individual to be the proprietor of an App business with our Unrupt open source webapp to seed its development. We are happy for you to copy our webapp code into your App and improve it to work better on its platform. 
Developers are thereby incentivized to earn from their efforts by selling great Apps embodying our inventions royalty free, so that the world can get to experience them for the first time in the open source domain. 
While we encourage you to sell Apps through any Appstore for platforms you are competent in, we wish to stay focussed on continuing to advance our underlying unique technology by cross-platform webapp, without the distraction of specific platform considerations. We will be delighted to cooperate with holders of the Proprietary License and anticipate we can together achieve the advances depicted in our Roadmap and enable their wide availability through your Apps and the Unrupt open source project.
If not a developer yourself you may know someone with the ability to create life improving Apps; if so please share. For instance Brian would like an Unrupt App to get over the problems we have with Mute and web notifications in our webapp on iOS, and to interoperate with the Phone App and would be happy to pay a dollar or more for each of his family's installs from an App Store:)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div>
<p><b>What type of contact lenses Can SWOOSH be used with?</b></p>
<p>At
this point, we have tested Swoosh to ensure it's safe for use with soft contact lenses only. If our
crowdfunding campaign is successful, we will look at completing Gas Permeable
testing.</p>
<p><b>What type of battery does SWOOSH use?</b></p>

Swoosh operates on a CR123A Lithium Battery. High powered and long lasting, this battery easily out performs AA batteries in both power and number of uses before needing replaced. </div>
<div>
<p><b>Where can I purchase CR123 Batteries?</b></p>
<p>CR123 batteries
are a common battery that can be purchase at most big box stores like Walmart
or Best Buy, however, we found purchasing from an online retailer like <a href=""http://www.batterybuyer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.batterybuyer.com</a> or <a href=""http://www.batteryjunction.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.batteryjunction.com</a> to be the most
cost effective.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What material is SWOOSH made of?</b></p>
<p>The Lens Baskets will be made from Polypropylene which is
commonly used for medical plastic items and many other contact lens cases. It's
also a UL listed material, so we know it’s safe. The Top and Bottom plates will
be made from Chrome Plated steel which provides strength and a quality feel
along with a great aesthetic. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where can I find the referenced statistics?</b></p>
<p>Please visit the News
and Info section of our website at <a href=""http://www.swooshlenscase.com/News-Info.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.swooshlenscase.com/News-Info.html</a>.
There you will find links to all of the cited and referenced statistics and materials.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Do I need to continue rubbing my lenses?</b></p>
<p>If you are among the few that diligently
rub their lenses and find this method works, don’t stop. Your eyes are to important. Use swoosh as a means
to further reduce your chance of infection and increase comfort.  However, as a high percentage of contact lens
wearers do not rub their lenses clean, we invented Swoosh. Contact lens wearers
need to have available to them another method
of getting their lenses clean other then the impractical, time consuming and
often ignored manual rubbing method. </p>
<p><b>How much does shipping cost?</b></p>
<p>Shipping costs varies depending on the perk you selected and your location.   Each perk lists the shipping cost that needs to be added to your contribution via Paypal. If you feel that you can get a better rate on shipping we are more then willing to work with you in an effort to reduce the shipping costs!</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Duties and taxes may be charged by customs officials in your country. As such, they are beyond our control. You are responsible for duties, taxes, and any other charges that your country chooses to impose for the import.</p>

What type of contact lenses Can SWOOSH be used with?
At
this point, we have tested Swoosh to ensure it's safe for use with soft contact lenses only. If our
crowdfunding campaign is successful, we will look at completing Gas Permeable
testing.
What type of battery does SWOOSH use?

Swoosh operates on a CR123A Lithium Battery. High powered and long lasting, this battery easily out performs AA batteries in both power and number of uses before needing replaced. 

Where can I purchase CR123 Batteries?
CR123 batteries
are a common battery that can be purchase at most big box stores like Walmart
or Best Buy, however, we found purchasing from an online retailer like www.batterybuyer.com or www.batteryjunction.com to be the most
cost effective.

What material is SWOOSH made of?
The Lens Baskets will be made from Polypropylene which is
commonly used for medical plastic items and many other contact lens cases. It's
also a UL listed material, so we know it’s safe. The Top and Bottom plates will
be made from Chrome Plated steel which provides strength and a quality feel
along with a great aesthetic. 

Where can I find the referenced statistics?
Please visit the News
and Info section of our website at http://www.swooshlenscase.com/News-Info.html.
There you will find links to all of the cited and referenced statistics and materials.

Do I need to continue rubbing my lenses?
If you are among the few that diligently
rub their lenses and find this method works, don’t stop. Your eyes are to important. Use swoosh as a means
to further reduce your chance of infection and increase comfort.  However, as a high percentage of contact lens
wearers do not rub their lenses clean, we invented Swoosh. Contact lens wearers
need to have available to them another method
of getting their lenses clean other then the impractical, time consuming and
often ignored manual rubbing method. 
How much does shipping cost?
Shipping costs varies depending on the perk you selected and your location.   Each perk lists the shipping cost that needs to be added to your contribution via Paypal. If you feel that you can get a better rate on shipping we are more then willing to work with you in an effort to reduce the shipping costs!

AKAREL comes in two slightly different models AKAREL7 (7 inch display) and AKAREL22 (22 inch display).
<p>Please note that AKAREL7 features an industrial grade projected capacitive multi touch connected via I2C and AKAREL22 features a USB connected capacitive single touch.</p>
<p>AKAREL integrates Android OS running on ARM Cortex A7 interconnected via UART with Arduino software running on  ATmega 328p.</p>
<p>Integration and connection of both chips on one PCB brings you the following advantages:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Best graphic and user </span>experience<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> of Android OS UI. </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Fast application development of Android OS - use of java libraries, emulator etc. </span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Network connectivity problem solved - forget WiFi modules kernel hacking. Just connect AKAREL to WiFi like you are used to doing with your phone. Please note that AKAREL features also an Ethernet connector.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Universe of libraries from the Arduino community that speed up your low level GPIO programming. Forget about writing a kernel module just to move one pin up. Just send the command from Android to Arduino via UART to do so.</span></li>
</ol><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>AKAREL7 has the best class 7"" multitouch touch screen. The utilized projected capacitive touch technology (PCT) allows to operate the touch screen with your fingers or even with your gloves on. More over PCT works when it is wet and can sustain scratches. We have spent quite a lot of time choosing the right touch and this is the one that is going to work all the time and is highly durable.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>1. How do i put my Arduino software/firmware on the chip?</b>
<p>There are 3 ways:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>You can use standard ICSP header which is present on the board using Arduino IDE.</li>
<li>Over the micro USB cable from Arduino IDE. Just replace avrdude executable on your computer with our script (part of the software package) that facilitates adb commands.</li>
<li>You can use our sample android application that uploads hex files  using avrdude.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2. AKAREL7's price seems to be high for me, why is that?</b><br/></p>
<ul>

AKAREL is a hardware development kit that integrates Android ARM Cortex A7 and Arduino ATmega328p on a single board with touch screen and free software.

Prototyping phase finished. Ready for manufacturing!

Support us by purchasing one of the first devices!







The Dream - Product for Hobbyists/Hackers
Our dream is to build a development kit that can be used by Android and Arduino hobbyists around the world to implement their ideas that require a touch screen interface.
There are tons of development kits around, but none of them is actually a complete solution which can be used in the real world. Some development kits are missing displays or touch, others use obscure software stacks. We would like to bring something to the world that has not been here yet. Imagine implementing your hack ideas within hours instead of days like you've been doing until now.
Do you want to build a fancy door locker, your own home automation or something else that requires a touch input?
We think our product AKAREL is the best fit for you. Do not hesitate and see the product specs, videos and our prototypes.






AKAREL Description

AKAREL comes in two slightly different models AKAREL7 (7 inch display) and AKAREL22 (22 inch display).
Please note that AKAREL7 features an industrial grade projected capacitive multi touch connected via I2C and AKAREL22 features a USB connected capacitive single touch.
AKAREL integrates Android OS running on ARM Cortex A7 interconnected via UART with Arduino software running on  ATmega 328p.
Integration and connection of both chips on one PCB brings you the following advantages:



Best graphic and user experience of Android OS UI. 

Fast application development of Android OS - use of java libraries, emulator etc. 
Network connectivity problem solved - forget WiFi modules kernel hacking. Just connect AKAREL to WiFi like you are used to doing with your phone. Please note that AKAREL features also an Ethernet connector.
Universe of libraries from the Arduino community that speed up your low level GPIO programming. Forget about writing a kernel module just to move one pin up. Just send the command from Android to Arduino via UART to do so.


AKAREL7 has the best class 7"" multitouch touch screen. The utilized projected capacitive touch technology (PCT) allows to operate the touch screen with your fingers or even with your gloves on. More over PCT works when it is wet and can sustain scratches. We have spent quite a lot of time choosing the right touch and this is the one that is going to work all the time and is highly durable.

AKAREL Possible Uses
AKAREL is a perfect fit for the following applications:

Smart home/Home automation/Home security system
Kiosks or Payment terminals
Smart devices connected to the Internet - i.e. washer machine, refrigerators etc..
Heating systems control
And thousands of devices waiting for you to invent them!

Your Contribution
We are NOT looking for money to support the run of our office or pay the phones.
We NEED your contributions only for the product manufacturing expenses (manufacturing the final PCBs, purchasing displays and other components). So when you purchase a perk you will receive one of the first devices. 
Our modest goal is to manufacture one batch of 200pcs of AKAREL, but of course we hope for more pieces - that depends on YOU! :)
You can also help us by spreading the word about this campaign to your friends.
And all the contributors' names will be written on the final product!

AKAREL Software Specification
With the AKAREL kit everyone gains GIT repository access to the following:


Uboot source code 
Linux kernel source (3.4.39)
Finetuned Android OS sources (4.2.2)
Arduino firmware sources 
Arduino tools (i.e. avrdude) compiled for android.
Example applications sources
More software:

Download access to virtual machine image with pre-installed tools enabling you to start modifying the code right away.
Scripts that compile entire thing (uboot, kernel, android, arduino)
Our philosophy is that everything should work out of the box and that includes the software stack.
We want you to concentrate on writing an application not on spending time to make the basic things work. We have done it for you already. And if you want to dive deeper and modify the Linux kernel or Android OS...Why not? You have all the sources available for you to change and compile.
In case you want to modify the kernel or Android OS faster we have something for you.
In order to save you from the hell of installing all the toolchain (correct version of gcc, libs, headers, automake, make, java, you name it) we have prepared a Ubuntu virtual machine for you which may be downloaded and which has all this toolchain preinstalled so that you can start recompiling your complete stack within a few minutes.

FAQ


1. How do i put my Arduino software/firmware on the chip?
There are 3 ways:


You can use standard ICSP header which is present on the board using Arduino IDE.
Over the micro USB cable from Arduino IDE. Just replace avrdude executable on your computer with our script (part of the software package) that facilitates adb commands.
You can use our sample android application that uploads hex files  using avrdude.



2. AKAREL7's price seems to be high for me, why is that?

We are trying our best to push the price as low as possible. But until we have some solid volumes it is hard. 
Most of the development kits are cheap because they don't contain expensive stuff like displays, touchscreens, audio amplifiers
Also the price is partially high due to the touchscreen we use. But believe us our projected capacitive touch is very durable and it is industrial grade. We didn't want to use a cheap Chinese touch that would stop working with the first scratch. 

3. Can I completely hide the Android System and Navigation Bars?



Yes, we have already done that. This is a common requirement to block a user from switching between apps. It is simple you will find it in the sample apps. 

4. Android 4.4 (Kitkat) support?
Currently no plans. We have to wait for a chip vendor to come with the support first (GPU drivers, kernel, etc.)
5. What USB devices are supported?
This depends on the kernel configuration. USB mass storage, mouse, keyboard, webcam, USB to serial, USB to LPT should work out of the box with the default configuration. If you find out that something is not enabled by default, just change the configuration and recompile kernel.

6. How is the touch calibration done?
Software for touch calibration is included. 


7. 3G/LTE support?
Currently out of scope. Networking is supported only via WiFi or Ethernet. We recommend to use WiFi tethering  from another phone if you really need to be connected via a cell network. It should be possible to use 3G USB stick, but currently, this has not been tested.
8. Camera support?
Currently out of scope. You will need to use a USB webcam. At this moment Microsoft LifeCam HD-6000 rendering into Android SurfaceView has been successfully tested, see the sample apps. But it should work with others too. It all depends on the webcam support in the Linux kernel and V4L.


9. Opensource hardware?
The question of open-sourcing PCB layout has not been resolved in our heads yet. We will reconsider the subject based on the success of this campaign. Possibly yes, we will see...

<h3>What is SonicRobo</h3>
<p></p>
<p>SonicRobo is an easy assembly robot for young kids aged 8 or above, no electronics experience or soldering need.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>Advantages:</b></i></p>
<p><i>1) Each motors associated with coded wheels.  The Controller can count how many turn to make accurate angle turning.   Coded wheels already install on motor with wires.  User just need to install the motors to the base and connect the wires.</i></p>
<p><i>2) Come with Motor driver stand with rainbow jumper wires connected.  Motor driver can be easy installed at the bottom of the robot with 2 screws.   Jumper wires are easy install just next to controller board. </i></p>
<p><i>3) Easy instruction and simplified circuit layout provided.   All wires are clearly labeled with easy jumper plug.  Kids just need to follow pictures to plug in. </i></p>
<p><i>4) Debugging mode installed:  Arduino nano controller came with debugging mode which provides user to check each components working status, from switches to motors. </i></p>
<p><i>5) We provide supporting forum for installation and further development supporting.</i></p>
<br/><p>It equipped with Arduino Nano controller, Ultra Sonic sensor turning head ( with fun looking ears ), front touch switch, 2 front wheels drive with optic discs to count wheels moving distance.   What the kids need is just a screw driver and a piece of mind.  By following simple assembly hardware assembly direction ( NO SOLDERING NEED), put in just a few jumper wires, batteries and it will be done in minutes.</p>
<p>All Arduino controller boards will come with pre-programmed with our code.  But the kids can modify and upload their own version.   ( Source code will be available for download from our website for all supporters )<br/></p>
<p>With Bluetooth version, it can also be controlled by our Android phone and iPhone App.  All the source code of  Arduino and App will be provided on our website. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who are we</h3>
<p>We are engineers, designer and teacher.  From experience on teaching young kids on electronics and making creative projects, we know many kids like robots.  But all robot kits in the market are either too expensive or need lot electronics background before the hardware be understood and assembly by the kids.  They need to design a circuit, design components placement, assigns ports and even need to solder log of wires to make it work.  Those robot kits are not for young kids, they are only for young adult with engineering background.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Kids can learn through making their own robot</h3>
<p>Therefore, we analysis and understand from the kid's point of view, what is fund, what is easy understanding, what are the basic components and steps to build a robot.   What you can give your kids are not only the robot, but the fun and successful feeling after they complete assembly a robot on their own. </p>

Who are we
We are engineers, designer and teacher.  From experience on teaching young kids on electronics and making creative projects, we know many kids like robots.  But all robot kits in the market are either too expensive or need lot electronics background before the hardware be understood and assembly by the kids.  They need to design a circuit, design components placement, assigns ports and even need to solder log of wires to make it work.  Those robot kits are not for young kids, they are only for young adult with engineering background.


Kids can learn through making their own robot
Therefore, we analysis and understand from the kid's point of view, what is fund, what is easy understanding, what are the basic components and steps to build a robot.   What you can give your kids are not only the robot, but the fun and successful feeling after they complete assembly a robot on their own. 
Thanks for the 3D printer technology, we are able to design and print out all the stands and parts to let the robot be easy assembly and look nice. 




Development flow 




Easy installation kit.


An Easy instruction menu, Arduino Nano board and all accessories screws will be included.   All wires are color and stick label clearly and most of them are direct plug next to the controller board with minimum jumper wires. 

 Arduino nano board will be programmed with our demo code and come with USB cable.  User can modify the source code and re-program it easily.

Hi Indiegogo! We are a group of passionate designers from Singapore and Italy.
Our approach towards this design is to simply bring about more convenience to the lives of the people around us. Thus, we present to you, Fold MeTM.

Why is this product necessary?
We realized that there are some common problems for many of us

Spending copious amount of time searching for objects in our bags?
Thumb drives and keys hidden in nooks and crannies, and are often lost?
Trouble finding our phones as they are buried under a pile of documents?
Always on-the-go yet a need to clear the table before leaving?
A missing 'home' for these essential items is long overdue!

Hence, we decided to design Fold MeTM.
 
Fold MeTM is a portable utility case designed for young adults. With Fold MeTM, house your essential items and carry them wherever you go.  

Fold meTM exudes style and undeniable fashion. It is foldable in multiple configurations, adapting to your various needs and situations.  

Configuration of Fold meTM


Compact and carefully thought out dimensions do not intrude into your daily activities, and portrays a quiet yet assuring presence.

<p>Choose from a Black or White core device and one of 3 colors for the Aluminum plate (Shown here on a black prototype):</p>
<p><img alt=""EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE Silver"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://edgetoedge.net/Pictures/ETE-Silver.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1> </h1>
<h1>Level II Customization</h1>
<p>You can add ANY graphic look to the die-cut aluminum plate as the ultimate level of customization. You upload your graphic, per our specs, keeping in mind there's a left-hand or right-hand choice to be made, and the fact that the finger-pull notch needs to be considered in regards to your graphic. The quality is amazing! There is a good price break for buying 10 or more, ideal for your company logo. Here are some sample ideas:</p>
<p><img alt=""Custom Plates 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://edgetoedge.net/Pictures/Plates1.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>HOW DOES IT ATTACH?</h1>
<p>After testing many different options, 1/16"" thick high performing double-sided foam tape was selected for attachment. Four small squares of the tape hold the device securely and also provide for surfaces (See illustration below) that may not be completely flat. Any thin piece of plastic can be used to slice through the foam to remove <em><strong>EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE</strong></em> if desired.</p>
<p><img alt=""Default Attachment Mechanism"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://edgetoedge.net/Pictures/Attach1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>An after-market option (<strong><em>NOT INCLUDED</em></strong>) I've found that also works very well are 3M Command Strips (Medium size) for hanging windows (Shown in video below). They come in (Click following links to view) <a href=""http://www.rulers.com/catalog/command-medium-adhesive-picture-hanging-strips-RLS9393647.html?cid=gkw_pla"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">black</a> or <a href=""http://www.stuff4crafts.com/white-command-medium-picture-hanging-strips-5-x2-75-3-sets-pkg-446477.html?CAWELAID=773377760"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">white</a>, <em><strong>let you attach/detach EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE as needed</strong></em>, and pull-tabs make it very easy to completely remove the strips without residue. The strips work like Velcro, only better. It takes two of the Command Strips (two on the back of <em><strong>EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE</strong></em> &amp; two on the device it's attaching to), which are approx. 2.75"" x 0.75"", running perpendicular to the length of <strong><em>EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE</em></strong>. I investigated including Command Strips with <strong><em>EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE</em></strong>, but they're proprietary &amp; our manufacturer could not source them, though I recommend them if you desire to have <em><strong>EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE</strong></em> be easily removable. I considered trying to purchase them &amp; add them post-manufacturing, but that just drives the cost up further &amp; not everyone would benefit from them, so I'm opting to leave it to the end user to buy them if desired. It's cheaper &amp; they're everywhere (Home Depot, Menard's, Office stores, etc). Their only drawback is they add some thickness (The foam tape provided with <em><strong>EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE</strong></em> is 1/16"", the Command Strip is 3/16"").</p>

<h1>CUSTOM GRAPHICS REQUIREMENTS</h1>
<div>
<p>Please submit your custom graphic in .tif, .jpg, or .eps.</p>
<p>If logos are being provided in vector format we can accept them in .eps format (please make sure to convert all the text to outlines/curves) &amp; submit the logo with a 5” x 2.525” rectangle around it.</p>
<p>Graphic should be 5” x 2.525” x  at 600 dpi. This artwork size includes a 1/16” bleed all around which will not print on the Plate. Plate size is 2.4” x 4.875”</p>
<p>For ideal results the image must be 1515 pixels high x 3000 pixels wide at 600 dpi. We can go as low as 300 dpi  with acceptable results which is 788 pixels high x 1500 pixels wide.</p>
<p>If images are not to the above standards we will crop them to our discretion and will print them at the resolution you provide.</p>
<p>Keep in mind when choosing an image that there is a finger notch on the side of the plate that will be cut from your image, and the fact that the device/notch can be left-handed or right-handed.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>CAN I GET ONE IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS?</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't send you an <em><strong>EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE</strong></em> to be given as a Christmas present for 2012. However, the next best thing is something I've received or given several times over the years from family members,  a GIFT NOTICE! It's not a redeemable Gift Certificate, but a card you print or email them that lets them know that you're giving them one of the very first <strong><em>EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE</em></strong> devices, and you will deliver it to them as soon as you receive it (Approx. April 2013). I know I'd be glad to get one!! I created a sample below &amp; will make it downloadable, or you can make your own.</p>

<h2><span><span>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</span></span></h2>
<p>I have 20 yrs of extensive experience as a leader in I.T., involving countless projects totaling many millions of dollars, establishing a proven track record of accomplishing and usually exceeding the goal. I also have several inventions currently at various stages of development. I have close relationships with highly qualified Engineers, Designers, highly qualified Business &amp; Financial Advisors, and have worked through the Design and Development process with a major State University on several of my inventions. Through the Engineering Firm I work with, manufacturing is lined up and ready to begin the tooling process as soon as funding is received through IndieGoGo. I'm working with a well known and highly capable Custom Engraving company here in West Michigan that will create the amazingly crisp and clear custom aluminum inserts and optional custom graphics and engraving offered in this project. These teams of experienced and highly qualified professionals are ready to begin fulfilling orders for <strong><em>EDGE&gt;&lt;EDGE</em></strong>. All we need is your participation and support!</p>

After testing many different options, 1/16"" thick high performing double-sided foam tape was selected for attachment. Four small squares of the tape hold the device securely and also provide for surfaces (See illustration below) that may not be completely flat. Any thin piece of plastic can be used to slice through the foam to remove EDGE><EDGE if desired.

 
An after-market option (NOT INCLUDED) I've found that also works very well are 3M Command Strips (Medium size) for hanging windows (Shown in video below). They come in (Click following links to view) black or white, let you attach/detach EDGE><EDGE as needed, and pull-tabs make it very easy to completely remove the strips without residue. The strips work like Velcro, only better. It takes two of the Command Strips (two on the back of EDGE><EDGE & two on the device it's attaching to), which are approx. 2.75"" x 0.75"", running perpendicular to the length of EDGE><EDGE. I investigated including Command Strips with EDGE><EDGE, but they're proprietary & our manufacturer could not source them, though I recommend them if you desire to have EDGE><EDGE be easily removable. I considered trying to purchase them & add them post-manufacturing, but that just drives the cost up further & not everyone would benefit from them, so I'm opting to leave it to the end user to buy them if desired. It's cheaper & they're everywhere (Home Depot, Menard's, Office stores, etc). Their only drawback is they add some thickness (The foam tape provided with EDGE><EDGE is 1/16"", the Command Strip is 3/16"").

CUSTOM GRAPHICS REQUIREMENTS

Please submit your custom graphic in .tif, .jpg, or .eps.
If logos are being provided in vector format we can accept them in .eps format (please make sure to convert all the text to outlines/curves) & submit the logo with a 5” x 2.525” rectangle around it.
Graphic should be 5” x 2.525” x  at 600 dpi. This artwork size includes a 1/16” bleed all around which will not print on the Plate. Plate size is 2.4” x 4.875”
For ideal results the image must be 1515 pixels high x 3000 pixels wide at 600 dpi. We can go as low as 300 dpi  with acceptable results which is 788 pixels high x 1500 pixels wide.
If images are not to the above standards we will crop them to our discretion and will print them at the resolution you provide.
Keep in mind when choosing an image that there is a finger notch on the side of the plate that will be cut from your image, and the fact that the device/notch can be left-handed or right-handed.
 
CAN I GET ONE IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS?
Unfortunately, we can't send you an EDGE><EDGE to be given as a Christmas present for 2012. However, the next best thing is something I've received or given several times over the years from family members,  a GIFT NOTICE! It's not a redeemable Gift Certificate, but a card you print or email them that lets them know that you're giving them one of the very first EDGE><EDGE devices, and you will deliver it to them as soon as you receive it (Approx. April 2013). I know I'd be glad to get one!! I created a sample below & will make it downloadable, or you can make your own.

 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
I have 20 yrs of extensive experience as a leader in I.T., involving countless projects totaling many millions of dollars, establishing a proven track record of accomplishing and usually exceeding the goal. I also have several inventions currently at various stages of development. I have close relationships with highly qualified Engineers, Designers, highly qualified Business & Financial Advisors, and have worked through the Design and Development process with a major State University on several of my inventions. Through the Engineering Firm I work with, manufacturing is lined up and ready to begin the tooling process as soon as funding is received through IndieGoGo. I'm working with a well known and highly capable Custom Engraving company here in West Michigan that will create the amazingly crisp and clear custom aluminum inserts and optional custom graphics and engraving offered in this project. These teams of experienced and highly qualified professionals are ready to begin fulfilling orders for EDGE><EDGE. All we need is your participation and support!",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Booster</h3>
<p><b>My story</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The history of developing Booster is closely related to my smartphone. When I was traveling and I wanted to listen to music, connect to the Internet or even if I tried to use the GPS, my battery always got discharged very fast. So I started thinking how to increase the operating time of my phone. Of course, there were a lot of power banks or solar chargers in the market, that´s true. BUT. Each of them needs a recharging cable. As I am a forgetful man, that was absolutely nothing for me. Then I got the idea of making something similar to a watchband, but with a charging cable integrated to one of the bands.</p>

Booster
My story

The history of developing Booster is closely related to my smartphone. When I was traveling and I wanted to listen to music, connect to the Internet or even if I tried to use the GPS, my battery always got discharged very fast. So I started thinking how to increase the operating time of my phone. Of course, there were a lot of power banks or solar chargers in the market, that´s true. BUT. Each of them needs a recharging cable. As I am a forgetful man, that was absolutely nothing for me. Then I got the idea of making something similar to a watchband, but with a charging cable integrated to one of the bands.

Design
Booster is the first wrist solar charger, which can be also used as a power bank. It can help you everywhere and every time you need to charge or boost you smartphone's battery.




Booster is not only a wrist solar charger or a fashion accessory, but primarily your personal rescuer in sudden situations when the battery in your smartphone is almost discharged and you have to make an important call, check the web or use the GPS urgently.

Booster is really the first one wrist solar charger, You can't find a similar product in any market around the world!

Materials
Booster is made from harmless materials. The shell is made of zinc alloy with the surface plating ""Black Nickel"". This gives the impression of a really robust and strong case. Actually it is also good for the electronics inside, because it´s perfectly protected.


The shell is made of zinc alloy, thickness of walls 1.5mm


Bottom is made of stainless stell with 2mm thickness.



Bands are made from 100% silicone, this material is pleasant to touch.

Versione italianaiHearty is a smart cover that listens for any signals around you and communicates with
your smartphone.Every
day we spend a lot of time with our smartphone in our hands. iHearty through
this continuous contact acquires useful information about our health. A dedicated set of sensors makes iHearty also able to monitor the
conditions of your ambient.
iHearty is an elegantly designed universal case suitable with most of the smartphones.iHearty uses a set of body sensors and ambient sensors to measure and analyze:
Heart rate
Skin temperature
Oxygen saturation
Humidity 
Pressure
Temperature
UV index
iHearty is a slim case equipped with powerful embedded sensors on the metallic plate to the back.  iHearty is a Bluetooth enabled device able to give a real feedback about your status. iHearty gives the ability to carry an accurate physiological monitor
anywhere, without additional devices.One of the advantages of iHearty is that it allows everyone to make
baseline measurements at any time, building a database that could allow for
improved detection of disease states. 

ECG: AF detectionHeart related diseases kill more and more people every year. The cost to detect and treat cardiovascular disease is too high. Monitoring and assessing the health of the heart for every cardiac cycle is of important and essential.iHearty could be used to detect atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the most common form of cardiac arrhythmia. AF is often asymptomatic and undiagnosed and is responsible for around a third of all strokes.An estimated 2.66 million people will have atrial fibrillation in 2010. As many as 12 million people will have the condition by 2050.

SpO2: monitoring level of oxygen in respiratory diseaseiHearty monitors the level of oxygen in the subject's blood and alerts if oxygen levels drop below safe levels, allowing rapid intervention. iHearty detects changes that could indicate early signs of hypoxemia, or less-than-safe levels of oxygen in the blood. This is very important for patients with respiratory or cardiac problems, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or for diagnosis of some sleep disorders such as apnea and hypopnea. Skin TemperatureSkin temperature is an effective indicator for objectively evaluating human sensations, because it is controlled by sympathetic nerve activity which reflects the course of information processing in the brain.The temperature of our hands is connected to our stress level: when we are stressed, we tend to have cold hands. Changes in hand temperature are a reflection of blood flow - a measure of the stress response.iHearty uses temperature sensor to detect ovulation for the best chance of getting pregnant.

In the last few months, we were looking for a convenient and 
elegant solution to protect our Mac when going out for lunch, or just 
grabbing a coffee at work.We were tired of worrying about leaving documents wide open and visible to anyone, on our Mac's screens!The result is Locky: the most convenient solution to lock your Mac using your iPhone and Apple Watch*, with a spark of fun and magic features.Besides just conveniently locking your Mac, Locky will propose additional fun and magic features, thanks to your contribution: learn more below!> Updates:* Check this out, Locky is on TechFaster.com !* Apple Watch, important note: depending on what the SDK allows, Apple Watch might have limitations compared to the iPhone version of LockyLocky. Your magic wand.
Locky will transform your iPhone and Apple Watch into a magic wand to lock your Mac when you walk away, and more:1. Locky locks your Mac if you walk away with your iPhone or Apple Watch*2. Our secret sauce to make it work seamless: in our prototype, we're making the most of your iPhone's (and Apple Watch* !) sensors and the brand new Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to detect motion and your distance from your Mac.3. Are you a oneSafe user? In that case, you will enjoy neat features in future versions of oneSafe (automatic lock of oneSafe, and 2-factor authentication)4. And more, such as:

unlock (not automatically!) your Mac with your iPhone or Apple Watch*
see your Mac's desktop background instantly updated on your iPhone (and possibly Apple Watch*: being studied!)


play with the distance thresholds
instantly detect intruders from your iPhone and Apple Watch*

<p><br/></p>
<p>DIMBODY is a 3d scanner, a digitalizer that allows you to take a physical object, and turn it into a digital 3D model on your computer.</p>
<p>DIMBODY is based on a triangulation between a laser plane  and a CMOS monochromatic sensor, it acquires point coordinates of an object (point cloud). The point cloud is then transformed in a 3d surface by the software and saved as a STL file. Subsequently you can print it in your 3d printer, or scale, then transform, or modify it in a CAD software.</p>
<p>Thanks to the rotating turret DIMBODY accuracy is outstanding and  thanks to its rotating platform the scanning phase is totally automated. </p>
<p>If you are a maker, you really need to have a DIMBODY to unleash your fantasy and avoid to losing time in 3d cad drawings. <br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>The rotating turret is the core value of DIMBODY. </p>
<p>Without a rotating turret, if you try to scan a body like this one:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/49773/files/20130903064849-ele.JPG?1378216129"" src="""" style=""""/></p>you will find that some parts like proboscis or ears will intercept the laser plane and it prevent the laser to correctly touch hidden areas. So you will have no points in that areas, and some holes in the resulting mesh.<p>But DIMBODY is smart, and can see things from different point of view. &lt;</p>
<p>Scanning process consist of two different phases.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">in the first phase platform turns at a 10°, 15°, 20° or 30° steps, and then the turret start to take a complete scanning (100 to 400 frames), and the process is repeated until the complete rotation of the object (360°)</p>
<p>When all the the frames are acquired we have a lot more information than all other competitors using fixed lasers.    </p>
<p><b>""why the rubicon 3d scanner only $199 (i believe without camera) cost and yours more then $500"" ?</b></p>
<p>Is not so easy to make comparison with a scanner that is not actually in production. But from what I can understand, Rubicon 3d includes 2 fixed lasers ad a rotating platform. I'm not able to understand how they synchronize platform rotation to camera frame grabbing. We use an industrial 5M monochromatic camera,   similar to: <a href=""http://www.oemcameras.com/dmm-72buc02-ml.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.oemcameras.com/dmm-72buc02-ml.htm</a>, a laser equipped with a first grade lens and a custom electronics to synchronize rotation of platform, turret rotation, and camera.</p>
<p>this lead us to hi quality scan, with an accuracy down to 0.1mm, and 15 milion points in a single model.</p>
<p><b>""What happens if the campaign is unsuccessful?""</b></p>
<p>You will be 100% refunded  (by Indiegogo)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>""If the campaign is unsuccessful (I hope it is not), would it still be possible to purchase a Dimbody kit?</b></p>
<p>no. production will not be started.</p>

<ul><li>Industrialize Electronic hardware. We need 3 different electronics cards. <br/>

Unleash your fantasy. 

DIMBODY is a 3d scanner, a digitalizer that allows you to take a physical object, and turn it into a digital 3D model on your computer.
DIMBODY is based on a triangulation between a laser plane  and a CMOS monochromatic sensor, it acquires point coordinates of an object (point cloud). The point cloud is then transformed in a 3d surface by the software and saved as a STL file. Subsequently you can print it in your 3d printer, or scale, then transform, or modify it in a CAD software.
Thanks to the rotating turret DIMBODY accuracy is outstanding and  thanks to its rotating platform the scanning phase is totally automated. 
If you are a maker, you really need to have a DIMBODY to unleash your fantasy and avoid to losing time in 3d cad drawings. 



Technical Specifications



5 Mpixel monocromatic CMOS sensor
red line laser 
max object size: 300 x 300 x 300mm (12x12x12 inches)
scanning time: 24 min at ULTRA resolution ( 10'000'000 points), 14 min at SUPER resolution (3'000'000 points), 8 min at NORMAL (1'000'000 points)
accuracy. +-0.1mm (ULTRA), +-0.2(SUPER) +- 0.4 (NORMAL)
USB2 



 
Open Source
All software, hardware and electronics components developed by us will be released as open source. Control electronic cards are based on arduino-compatible microcontroller. You can use arduino ide to modify , or to develop a completely new one. 

DIMBODY believes in open source software and hardware developing. We are working on a arduino-compatible electronics, which design will be released and free.  At the end of this campaign clients could buy even only single parts, (like this arduino based control card) 
At the same way control software will be released as open source, so you or the community can modify it as you like.
Communication control between DIMBODY ad pc will be published and every one can utilize personal software to manage point clouds and mesh generation 


 
Why a rotating turret lead to a better mesh for complex models?

The rotating turret is the core value of DIMBODY. 
Without a rotating turret, if you try to scan a body like this one:
you will find that some parts like proboscis or ears will intercept the laser plane and it prevent the laser to correctly touch hidden areas. So you will have no points in that areas, and some holes in the resulting mesh.But DIMBODY is smart, and can see things from different point of view. <
Scanning process consist of two different phases.  
in the first phase platform turns at a 10°, 15°, 20° or 30° steps, and then the turret start to take a complete scanning (100 to 400 frames), and the process is repeated until the complete rotation of the object (360°)
When all the the frames are acquired we have a lot more information than all other competitors using fixed lasers.    
""why the rubicon 3d scanner only $199 (i believe without camera) cost and yours more then $500"" ?
Is not so easy to make comparison with a scanner that is not actually in production. But from what I can understand, Rubicon 3d includes 2 fixed lasers ad a rotating platform. I'm not able to understand how they synchronize platform rotation to camera frame grabbing. We use an industrial 5M monochromatic camera,   similar to: http://www.oemcameras.com/dmm-72buc02-ml.htm, a laser equipped with a first grade lens and a custom electronics to synchronize rotation of platform, turret rotation, and camera.
this lead us to hi quality scan, with an accuracy down to 0.1mm, and 15 milion points in a single model.
""What happens if the campaign is unsuccessful?""
You will be 100% refunded  (by Indiegogo)

""If the campaign is unsuccessful (I hope it is not), would it still be possible to purchase a Dimbody kit?
no. production will not be started.


 
What We Need 
 

to fully industrialize DIMBODY we need founding in order to:

Buy moldings - We need 5 big moldings for the frame, platform and the turret, 3 small moldings for rotating system. Principal parts will be realized in Nylon (PA+GF30) other in POM. 
Industrialize Electronic hardware. We need 3 different electronics cards. 




An usb to a PC/MAC interface (It has to power the laser, move and control the turret and platform rotation, synchronize movement and the image acquisition of the monochromatic CMOS sensor)   

A controller card for the stepper motors

An USB camera card 

Software:



Base algorithms are ready and tested, we are in the phase of encapsulating it in an easy to use interface. 

So, where are we now?
The platform and the industrial design are complete, we are currently doing tests on the hardware and the first production samples are ready to be launched . Now, we need your help to finish development, buy new tooling, moulds, and expand our manufacturing capabilities.


 
Your contribution
 
We have put a lot of time, funds and efforts into our project but like many things in life not everything can be completed in just a few days. You and your contribution will enable us to reach our goal. You will be a part of a world first in enabling us to complete production of the more accurate 3d scanner/ digitalizer for makers ever realized!

Have you ever experienced going out with friends or family, and yet feel lonely, as though no one was listening? We have. Heck, we all are guilty of having skipped real social activities just to spend time online. Spending virtual time with your friends on the couch? Does that sound ridiculous to you?


For a fact, we aren't going to allow anyone take our phones away, not even for a second. So, we thought, why not embrace the rise of mobile technology to create behavior that brings back or perhaps, create even more real interactions among us? So let us help you get off your couch and have some real interactions today! Sounds impossible? Keep reading!








Daredevil is a free iPhone app dedicated in bringing back the once popular ""Truth or Dare"" game, but this time, to a whole new level. 





We will be the first social platform that stands out from the others, one that promises the enhancement of real connection in your lives through unique fun filled activities with anyone around you.


Earn your bragging rights through completing dares. Plus, you now have an additional  awesome topic of discussion ongoing with your friends! Guess what? We will even reward you for completing these activities based on how creative and interestingly you've done it.






Join Our World

Getting started has never been simpler, easier and faster when all it takes is one tap to connect to the world of Daredevils. Tap on the search button and you will be instantly brought to a lobby with other Daredevils.

Accept Your Undertaking
One unique task will be issued to all Daredevils. Brainstorm and cooperate with friends around you to post the most interesting and creative photo or video. Videos posted will have a limit of 10 seconds, so keep it short and sweet.

Prove Yourself
Each Daredevil's video will be verified by one another, as well as the rest of the community who will be able to watch the videos too. Based on a voting system, the four Daredevils will be ranked according to their videos, and rewards will be distributed according to ranks. 


Share Your Deeds
Accumulate recognition and perhaps popularity for your efforts by sharing your video. Don't just share it online, show it to your friends personally and impress them! This step is completely up to you.




Never Get The Same Dare Twice




We have created an algorithm that ensures a unique and interesting task every time you make a search.


Tag Team
Want to meet new people? No problem! Our location based tagging allows you to find people nearby for a tag teamed dare. Seriously, what better way is there to forge new friendships than with a dare together?

Avatars
Customize your personal Daredevil character in your own exclusive style with in-game credits earned as rewards for completing tasks.

Character Profiling
Rake in points as you complete more dares. Show the world how much of a Daredevil you are!








We aim to launch the iOS app by the end of the campaign, and get it to you, our beta testers, to use the app and let us know what works, and what doesn't. We plan to beta test till early January and officially launch by end January! We have begun development of the iOS app and our team is hard at work to get the app into the hands of our backers as soon as possible!


Your importance to us
We recognize that we are going to need a large dedicated community in order for Daredevil to successfully take off. Having every one of you backers in our Daredevil community would be the greatest thing we can ask for, and every feedback we receive from you is important. Help us spread the word of Daredevil, and create a world that embraces mobile technology for fun-filled social activities.
Every single cent of of your backings will be used in the development and constant improvement of the app to keep every Daredevil interested and connected, and ensuring that it is able to reach out in the market. We will organize launch events, and contact the press as well as tech companies to make Daredevil a world renowned app with a large number of users.

Ultimately, the app is a platform for a community of Daredevils (yes, you!), and our aim for this crowdfunding campaign is to make this community come alive. 




We here at Daredevil know that there are always risks involved in every campaign. We believe our biggest challenges to be getting a critical number of people using Daredevil as we believe that if there are more users, the dares will get more interesting and allow for a good user experience. 
We recognize this challenge and have already been actively promoting Daredevil. We would like to call on your help too, to help us achieve a community of Daredevils! As our core team is made up of developers and designers, we will not be relying on a third party to create the app, thus ensuring that you, our backers, get the best user experience while using our app.



Why iOS before Android and Windows?


Our team is currently more experienced in iOS app development and look to create the best possible experience for you. Fret not, we look forward to welcoming all Android and Windows phone users on board our community, and will release these versions really soon. We will keep you updated!


Can I still donate if I am not an iOS user?
We would definitely love to have you in the Daredevil community regardless of whether you donated or not. That being said, any donation would most certainly be of immense help us to release the Android version earlier. Besides, who wouldn't want a cool Daredevil T-shirt or exclusive bottle opener?


Will there be a free version of Daredevil available?
Daredevil WILL be a FREE app throughout. Our vision lies in creating the best possible experience for all users, and in building a fun filled community of Daredevils.


I can't get my payment to work in Paypal, what should I do?
Email the Indiegogo Customer Happiness Team at support@indiegogo.com. They'll be able to track your transaction and help with any issues.
I contributed to a perk but I forgot to add the extra amount for shipping. How can I increase the amount?

<p>
More over, these are the main points for which Moggles har been designed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Foldable.</b> Your phone is portable and fits your pocket, why shouldn't your headset? </li>
<li>
<b>Lenses.</b> We have calculated and experimented a lot with lenses, Moggles has the best single lens system possible. These aspherical lenses which will give you the right focus on the whole display. This will enhance the experience while reducing nausea. </li>
<li>
<b>Input.</b> Moggles Hand Controller is a simple control that you can navigate with in your sleep.</li>
<li>
<b>Positional tracking.</b> Positional tracking is one of the important parameters to reduce nausea. It will also give you a lot better immersive experience!</li>
<li>
<b>Comfortable and ergonomic.</b> Moggles is designed to be light weight, easily adjustable, user friendly and comfortable to wear.</li>
<li>
<b>Beautiful.</b> We think that Moggles is the best looking headset so far. Don't you agree?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<div id="""">
<h1>The Hand Controller</h1>
<p>
Virtual reality is all about immersion (the feeling of being somewhere else) and in time we will even be able to use our hands in VR by tracking them with the camera of the phone. From an ergonomic perspective, working with your hands above your head or in front of your face is not comfortable during a longer time of use. A hand controller is a good complement and known interface which you can use in a comfortable position.
</p>
<p>Since there is a need for additional input to the phone, and hand tracking is not ergonomic, we have developed <b>a custom made motion hand controller that fits inside the smartphone holder when Moggles is folded</b>. It has the familiar hand controller interface, a stearing pad with four arrows, four action buttons and L+R buttons.
</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/003/114/057/6d66bd03eff5137bb0293bdb98aaf361_large.png?1420633677"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<p>The best part is that the hand controller has built in sensors to register and use your hand movements. Use it as a laser pointer, a sword, handgun or anything you want. Or, you could even <b>3D-print a case for the controller</b>, and create a sword or a gun for example! Use the same 3D-file and render it in your VR environment and it will booth feel and look realistic.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion tracking with built in 6-axis gyro and accelerometer</li>
<li>Quick escape button to switch to smartphone camera and a window to the real world</li>
<li>Low energy Bluetooth for long lasting battery</li>
<li>Rechargable battery to work with standard micro USB chargers</li>
<li>Emulates keyboard and mouse - no API needed. Already works with a number of apps that are supporting bluetooth hand controller.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Software</h1>
<p>
Today, there are around 100 different demo apps in app stores compatible with Moggles and the content is steadily increasing. We want it to be easy to create, use, browse and share VR experiences. Therefore, we want VR to live on the web. Stream videos, browse pictures, find games and share links to exciting experiences with your friends. No downloads needed. <b>You browse in a seamless user interface.</b> With modern web standards, 3D content in browsers are easy, efficient and works with any phone without app specific code.
</p>
<p>
The web is a great place to browse and find content but the headtracking needs to be done in an app to run in real time. This is what the Moggles app does.
</p>
<br/>
<h1>The Moggles App</h1>
<p>
The Moggles app keeps track of the head rotations and even reads your position using the smartphone camera. The information is sent to the browser so the content can use this to update the screen.
</p>
<p>
It gives you positional and rotational tracking for the web. Easy!
</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1219044/files/20150213060428-Moggles_App.png?1423836268"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<p>
To be able to create low latency head positional (camera vision) and rotational tracking (sensor fusion) the algorithms needs to run close to the sensors. <b>With the Moggles app, calculations runs in the app and the content runs in your browser, creating the best VR performance.</b></p>
<p>
The app also customizes your phone for VR mode: locking it in landscape mode, turning the screen saver off, adjusting the display brightness and connects to the hand controller. One button to turn your smartphone into Moggle-mode.</p>
<p>
The Moggles app takes care of all the VR-specific stuff so that third party developers can focus on the content for the best user experience!
</p>

</p>
<p>
Start one of all available VR apps or the Moggles web VR app. Replace the hand controller with your phone in the Moggles phone holder. Put Moggles on your head and enjoy!
</p>
<p>
The display is updated from your heads movement, changing its viewing direction and position using the smartphones sensors and camera. <b>This is not only giving you a portable 200” 3D screen, but also a wireless 360 degrees rotational and positional head tracking device.</b> With Moggles, you can literally walk around in another world.</p>

<h1>When to use Moggles?</h1>

<div id="""">
<h1>Available content</h1>
<p>
There are a decent amount (120+) of apps developed for mobile VR headsets already. In fact, Moggles is compatible with all apps developed for mobile VR headsets like Google Cardboard, VR for LG G3 and so on. So all games or apps developed for other mobile headsets (except Gear VR) works for Moggles as well.
</p>
<p>
Even the Moggles Hand Controller works for several apps today already. The controler emulates a keyboard and mouse over Bluetooth, so there is no need for an extra API for developers to include it. Most games that uses a controller as input works with the Moggles Hand Controller too! 
</p>
<p>
With big names such as LG and Google on the same train, you can count on that more content will be developed for mobile VR. Moggles strive to be compatible with all apps developed for mobile VR (except those for Gear VR).
</p>
<p>
Here are a few selected samples of third party apps that works with Moggles today, some already with the hand controller. For a more in-depth list of VR apps, visit <a href=""http://www.moggles.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">moggles.com</a>

<h1>Panorama video</h1>
<p>
Panorama cameras are the next revolution of video, and now even <b>Youtube</b> has joined the circus. Instead of capturing a small frame of an event, a panorama camera captures everything in the scene around you!
</p>
<p>
The best way of watching a panorama video is of course to step into the video and be able to look around, like if you were there! With Moggles, watching panorama videos are natural.
</p>
<p>
Panorama video streaming of events are just around the corner, with Moggles and a panorama live stream you can be on the scene with your favourite band, sit in the jumbotron on a sports event or participate at a party on the other side of the world!
</p>
<p>
In Hollywood, production of panorama movies has already begun, the industry loves this new, exciting technology. Youtube has just announced that they will support streaming of panorama videos. There will be a lot of content for Moggles users!
</p>

<h1>Create your own content</h1>
<p>
Creating content for VR is easy, even if you are not a developer. There are a couple of panorama video cameras soon hitting the market. Throw away your old action camera and start shooting 360 panorama videos instead!

<p>
<b>Games and Architectural</b>
</p>
<p>
With our partner Goo technologies it is already possible to create 3D environments by drag and drop your cad files which enables both games and architectural adventures right in your browser. There are several benefits, one mayor is that you won´t fill up your phones memory. Another that you wont need to create app form your project, you can just send a link.

<h1>SLAM positioning</h1>
<p>
We use the camera of your smartphone to track your movements relative to the environment. This means that you will not only be able to look around, but also to walk around in a virtual environment!

<h1>Where will the funds go?</h1>
<p>
Taking the hardware to mass production is expensive. The design has to be optimized for production and we need to manufacture custom tools for injection moulding. All parts of the production chain has to be tested and controlled. The hardware also has to pass the CE certification which could be a costly process. <b>The fundings will cover manufacturing costs for the hardware and the development of the app and web platform.</b>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Will I get nauseous from using Moggles?</b><br/>
    There are several factors to why some people get nauseous from using head mounted displays. Most importantly is the conflict in your brain, you see movement but your body isn't moving. This can be reduced by designing the user experience in a smart way. We also do reduce this factor by reading your actual movements, so you can not only look around but also walk around in VR, this technology is called SLAM positioning by using the smartphone camera. </li>
<li>
<b>Is moggles compatible with the apps for Coogle Cardboard?</b><br/>
    Yes. </li>
<li>
<b>How do I create spherical videos?</b><br/>
    You could either buy a 360 camera or build your own rig using several GoPros. See the section about panorama videos.
  </li>
<li>
<b>Will there be more apps available in app stores?</b><br/>
    Yes! When we started this project there were none. Thanks to the Google Cardboard project there are now over 100 apps and that number is increasing every day!
  </li>
<li>
<b>Can I use Moggles as a portable TV-screen to watch regular 2D/3D-movies?</b><br/>
    Yes! That means that you can enjoy a movie on a 200"" 3D screen on the train or wherever you are.
  </li>
<li>
<b>Is the Moggles Hand Controller compatible with my phone?</b><br/>
    If you have a modern smartphone with Bluetooth, it shouldn't be a problem! It already works with several apps in App store and Goggle Play.</li>
<li>
<b>What are the inputs of the Hand Controller?</b><br/>
The Moggles Hand Controller has a four button arrow pad, four action buttons, L+R-buttons, start/select and motion sensing from a 6DOF accelerometer and gyro.
  </li>
<li>
<b>What is the Moggles App used for?</b><br/>
  The Moggles App makes mobile web VR possible. The app does all the heavy lifting in real time and communicates with your browser through a Javascript API. Content can then be placed and browsed in the web, no downloads needed!
  </li>
<li>
<b>Do I have to use the Moggles App?</b><br/>
  No, the Moggles App is for browsing web VR content, all other VR apps works on Moggles just as well.
  </li>
<li>
<b>Does Moggles support my phone?</b><br/>
  It all depends on the outer dimensions of your smartphone. All phones up to 5.5"" will fit, even some with a larger screen, like the Note4. 6 inch phones are usually to large. The maximum outer dimensions supported is 160 x 80 x 10 mm. The experience is also better with a high resolution display and fast GPU/CPU. The best thing is that when you buy a new phone, you will get a better VR experience for free!
  </li>
<li>
<b>How confident are you that your planning is reliable?</b><br/>
We have partnered up with a company started by former Ericsson supply chain managers, they have tons of experience and contacts in production. They will provide the whole production chain, we give them the CAD-files and they take care of everything from manufacturing tooling, testing and CE certifications to assembly and packaging.

The timeplan is given by them and we trust them on this. But there is always a risk of course.

 What is moggles?

Moggles, short for mobile goggles, is a Virtual Reality Console. Made to fit your pocket. It works with any smartphone with a display size from 4"" to 5.7"" and is for both iOS and Android!




How does it work?

Games, videos, pictures and homepages, VR is more than just gaming, it is an interface, where you get a feeling of being inside your media. Visit an apartment, explore the space or the oceans, take a virtual tour of your favourite city or simply take a minute off from your stressful life and travel virtually to anywhere in the world.


By using your smartphone together with a pair of Moggles,  you get a portable 200” 3D screen with 360 degrees head tracking, anywhere you want. 
All you need to add is your smartphone.


Moggles is a complete VR console that comes together with a hand controller equipped with dynamic motion tracking. 
Moggles works together with all Goggle cardboard (+120 apps available) compatible content. 
Peoples reactions!




The Headset



Moggles folds into itself and becomes small enough to fit in your pocket.

More over, these are the main points for which Moggles har been designed.



Foldable. Your phone is portable and fits your pocket, why shouldn't your headset? 

Lenses. We have calculated and experimented a lot with lenses, Moggles has the best single lens system possible. These aspherical lenses which will give you the right focus on the whole display. This will enhance the experience while reducing nausea. 

Input. Moggles Hand Controller is a simple control that you can navigate with in your sleep.

Positional tracking. Positional tracking is one of the important parameters to reduce nausea. It will also give you a lot better immersive experience!

Comfortable and ergonomic. Moggles is designed to be light weight, easily adjustable, user friendly and comfortable to wear.

Beautiful. We think that Moggles is the best looking headset so far. Don't you agree?



The Hand Controller

Virtual reality is all about immersion (the feeling of being somewhere else) and in time we will even be able to use our hands in VR by tracking them with the camera of the phone. From an ergonomic perspective, working with your hands above your head or in front of your face is not comfortable during a longer time of use. A hand controller is a good complement and known interface which you can use in a comfortable position.

Since there is a need for additional input to the phone, and hand tracking is not ergonomic, we have developed a custom made motion hand controller that fits inside the smartphone holder when Moggles is folded. It has the familiar hand controller interface, a stearing pad with four arrows, four action buttons and L+R buttons.




The best part is that the hand controller has built in sensors to register and use your hand movements. Use it as a laser pointer, a sword, handgun or anything you want. Or, you could even 3D-print a case for the controller, and create a sword or a gun for example! Use the same 3D-file and render it in your VR environment and it will booth feel and look realistic.




Motion tracking with built in 6-axis gyro and accelerometer
Quick escape button to switch to smartphone camera and a window to the real world
Low energy Bluetooth for long lasting battery
Rechargable battery to work with standard micro USB chargers
Emulates keyboard and mouse - no API needed. Already works with a number of apps that are supporting bluetooth hand controller.




                                


The Software

Today, there are around 100 different demo apps in app stores compatible with Moggles and the content is steadily increasing. We want it to be easy to create, use, browse and share VR experiences. Therefore, we want VR to live on the web. Stream videos, browse pictures, find games and share links to exciting experiences with your friends. No downloads needed. You browse in a seamless user interface. With modern web standards, 3D content in browsers are easy, efficient and works with any phone without app specific code.


The web is a great place to browse and find content but the headtracking needs to be done in an app to run in real time. This is what the Moggles app does.


The Moggles App

The Moggles app keeps track of the head rotations and even reads your position using the smartphone camera. The information is sent to the browser so the content can use this to update the screen.


It gives you positional and rotational tracking for the web. Easy!





To be able to create low latency head positional (camera vision) and rotational tracking (sensor fusion) the algorithms needs to run close to the sensors. With the Moggles app, calculations runs in the app and the content runs in your browser, creating the best VR performance.

The app also customizes your phone for VR mode: locking it in landscape mode, turning the screen saver off, adjusting the display brightness and connects to the hand controller. One button to turn your smartphone into Moggle-mode.

The Moggles app takes care of all the VR-specific stuff so that third party developers can focus on the content for the best user experience!




Works with both Android and iOS
Algorithms for head rotational and positional tracking
Connects with hand controller via Bluetooth
Javascript API (for creators), drag and drop to connect to any web content such as video or CAD material.
Easy access to relevant smartphone settings.
  
Locks the phone in landscape mode
Switches the screen saver off
Saves your personal settings


Switches to Moggles mode for your personal VR settings from one button.
                                         





Step by step




Start one of all available VR apps or the Moggles web VR app. Replace the hand controller with your phone in the Moggles phone holder. Put Moggles on your head and enjoy!


The display is updated from your heads movement, changing its viewing direction and position using the smartphones sensors and camera. This is not only giving you a portable 200” 3D screen, but also a wireless 360 degrees rotational and positional head tracking device. With Moggles, you can literally walk around in another world.


When to use Moggles?






Available content

There are a decent amount (120+) of apps developed for mobile VR headsets already. In fact, Moggles is compatible with all apps developed for mobile VR headsets like Google Cardboard, VR for LG G3 and so on. So all games or apps developed for other mobile headsets (except Gear VR) works for Moggles as well.


Even the Moggles Hand Controller works for several apps today already. The controler emulates a keyboard and mouse over Bluetooth, so there is no need for an extra API for developers to include it. Most games that uses a controller as input works with the Moggles Hand Controller too! 


With big names such as LG and Google on the same train, you can count on that more content will be developed for mobile VR. Moggles strive to be compatible with all apps developed for mobile VR (except those for Gear VR).


Here are a few selected samples of third party apps that works with Moggles today, some already with the hand controller. For a more in-depth list of VR apps, visit moggles.com 






Panorama video

Panorama cameras are the next revolution of video, and now even Youtube has joined the circus. Instead of capturing a small frame of an event, a panorama camera captures everything in the scene around you!


The best way of watching a panorama video is of course to step into the video and be able to look around, like if you were there! With Moggles, watching panorama videos are natural.


Panorama video streaming of events are just around the corner, with Moggles and a panorama live stream you can be on the scene with your favourite band, sit in the jumbotron on a sports event or participate at a party on the other side of the world!


In Hollywood, production of panorama movies has already begun, the industry loves this new, exciting technology. Youtube has just announced that they will support streaming of panorama videos. There will be a lot of content for Moggles users!


Kolor Panorama Video

A great place to create, upload, browse, share, publish and view panorama 360 videos is at Kolor.


Want to test fly a Hawker Hunter fighter aircraft with Moggles? No problem!


Want to be on stage at a rock concert in Rio with Moggles? No problem!


Take a break from your office and go hiking on the Pineta mountain range. Easy!




                                          


Create your own content

Creating content for VR is easy, even if you are not a developer. There are a couple of panorama video cameras soon hitting the market. Throw away your old action camera and start shooting 360 panorama videos instead!

Timeline

Where we are now and where we are going.






Where will the funds go?

Taking the hardware to mass production is expensive. The design has to be optimized for production and we need to manufacture custom tools for injection moulding. All parts of the production chain has to be tested and controlled. The hardware also has to pass the CE certification which could be a costly process. The fundings will cover manufacturing costs for the hardware and the development of the app and web platform.

FAQ


Will I get nauseous from using Moggles?
    There are several factors to why some people get nauseous from using head mounted displays. Most importantly is the conflict in your brain, you see movement but your body isn't moving. This can be reduced by designing the user experience in a smart way. We also do reduce this factor by reading your actual movements, so you can not only look around but also walk around in VR, this technology is called SLAM positioning by using the smartphone camera. 

Is moggles compatible with the apps for Coogle Cardboard?
    Yes. 

How do I create spherical videos?
    You could either buy a 360 camera or build your own rig using several GoPros. See the section about panorama videos.
  

Will there be more apps available in app stores?
    Yes! When we started this project there were none. Thanks to the Google Cardboard project there are now over 100 apps and that number is increasing every day!
  

Can I use Moggles as a portable TV-screen to watch regular 2D/3D-movies?
    Yes! That means that you can enjoy a movie on a 200"" 3D screen on the train or wherever you are.
  

Is the Moggles Hand Controller compatible with my phone?
    If you have a modern smartphone with Bluetooth, it shouldn't be a problem! It already works with several apps in App store and Goggle Play.

What are the inputs of the Hand Controller?
The Moggles Hand Controller has a four button arrow pad, four action buttons, L+R-buttons, start/select and motion sensing from a 6DOF accelerometer and gyro.
  

What is the Moggles App used for?
  The Moggles App makes mobile web VR possible. The app does all the heavy lifting in real time and communicates with your browser through a Javascript API. Content can then be placed and browsed in the web, no downloads needed!
  

Do I have to use the Moggles App?
  No, the Moggles App is for browsing web VR content, all other VR apps works on Moggles just as well.
  

Does Moggles support my phone?
  It all depends on the outer dimensions of your smartphone. All phones up to 5.5"" will fit, even some with a larger screen, like the Note4. 6 inch phones are usually to large. The maximum outer dimensions supported is 160 x 80 x 10 mm. The experience is also better with a high resolution display and fast GPU/CPU. The best thing is that when you buy a new phone, you will get a better VR experience for free!
  

How confident are you that your planning is reliable?
We have partnered up with a company started by former Ericsson supply chain managers, they have tons of experience and contacts in production. They will provide the whole production chain, we give them the CAD-files and they take care of everything from manufacturing tooling, testing and CE certifications to assembly and packaging.

The timeplan is given by them and we trust them on this. But there is always a risk of course.",40.0,1,"1 Campaign

Custom RAIOYou  can  prepare  your   own  RAIO  casing  version  tailored  to  your  own  needs. Our  project  allows  for  the  modification  of  the front panel which is changed to implement  your  idea. This  will give you the  possibility to equip your casing with extra buttons, joysticks, expansion ports and PCB extending cards.  
Sample project of the oscilloscope based on the Bitscope platform with two BNC outputs and a 10-pin IDC connector.We  will  make the front panel on the basis of your own design prepared by you at custom.raio.eu.  Please   send  us  your   file  at  custom@raio.eu  by  10.15.2015. You can  also  download CAD/DWG and prepare it for us. We allow you to modify your computer after you purchase will not lose guarantee.In addition, at the back of the casing, we prepared an extra pocket which you can use  in  many  different  ways.  Each  RAIO  version  is equipped  with such pocket.Back pocket for additional boards.Rewards:Choice your model of RAIO
         All versions include plastic raio housing
RAIO GIFTHelp our computers get  to 
 organizations  which  teach children programming and electronic design, as well as introduce them  to Open Source. Together, we can help any   foundation,   giving   it   a   powerful  development  platform  called  RAIO  GIFT. Our  encounters with young  participants of the Coder Dojo foundation have proven how easy to use  and stimulating the RAIO computer  is. Help to inspire and support young people who want to create their own technology. Just fund one RAIO Gift and we will deliver it at our own expense to any organization in the world.Such organization may be one of the following:- CoderDojo.org  You can select the unit you want to support from a list- Codeclub.org.ukIf  you know any foundation which we can jointly support, please send us the details at office@raio.eu. If you donate one RAIO GIFT, you will receive our unique goodwill rewards  certificate,   and  your  RAIO  GIFT  computer  casing  will  have  your name written on it.




All we need is YouWe  need  your support  to execute the injection mould for  manufacturing  plastic cases for RAIO.  We have prepared  3D RAIO casing models and then sent them to the manufacturers of injection moulds. Following consultations, we received price offers for preparing injection moulds for RAIO cases.  Based on that we estimated the costs related to launching complex production of RAIO PC panels.We  completed  the prototype  version  of  RAIO  for  tests  with the cases made of  metal,  which  we  used  as  the  platform   for  Raspberry  for  5 months. Our team  provided  the  prototype   for  tests  to  the  most  demanding  group  of users,  the young enthusiasts from Coder Dojo.   RAIO  enabled  introduction  of  its  users  to the  world  of  Raspberry Pi  in  a  friendly  manner.  In   order   to   make   the  RAIO project real, we need $ 68 000.  This   amount  will  let  us launch  the  production of  RAIO,  thanks  to  which  we  will  be  able  to introduce in the market cheap and practical  sets   for  working  with  Raspberry Pi.  At the moment the only thing  we  need  is  your  help  to make RAIO project real.PRODUCTION TIMELINE
Risks & ChalengesItouch System is a company which has been handling the production of panel PCs for industry for 10 years. We came up with the idea of building a cheap  PC  based    on Raspberry platform over a year ago. When designing the RAIO case,  we  could  not allow  for  limiting the opportunities provided by Pi. For  this  reason, RAIO  has   the option of preparing an individual version of each case. We have at our disposal the front panel, which we are free to adjust  to our needs  by  adding  extensions Pi (pi hats), buttons, prototype discs, I/O ports, USB or RS232 ports. Additionally, in the  casing  sheathing  we  have  a  pocket,  which  we  may  also  use for additional configurations expanding the possibilities of Raspberry. We have developed a simple website custom.raio.eu, where you can prepare  your own version of RAIO casing, which  we  will execute for you. The components used for  manufacturing   RAIO  are  proven  subassemblies,  which  were  tested  in  our professional   solutions   for   industry.   We   need   6   months  for  completing  the processes  related to  launching  constant  production  of  RAIO  Panel PCs. During this  time  we  will  keep  you  informed  about  progress  in  the completion of RAIO project via our Facebook and Twitter profiles.",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>Why Teleport?</h2>
<p>A couple of years ago, we had this very question. Why? <strong>Why can’t we just send a file to a friend? Directly. Without uploading the content, sharing folders, using up our cloud storage, and all the mess entailed in simply sending a file.</strong></p>
<p>Two years have passed since that original question, and we’re pretty sure that there’s a lot of people in our same situation. But no one has done anything to solve the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Because it IS a problem.</strong></p>
<p>So, a few months ago, we were dining in a restaurant, and the idea comes up again and we decided to make it a reality. We are two software engineers with more than 10 years experience developing for the web and devices that reach millions of users.</p>
<p>We know how to solve the problem, and we need your help.</p>
<h2>The P2P private network.</h2>
<p><strong>Teleport is a P2P private network for sharing content.</strong> Just log in with your Teleport account and start sending content straight away.</p>
<p><strong>Everybody loves to share files:</strong> photos, videos, documents, music and much more. With Teleport you can share large files in a few clicks through P2P. And it’s easy, private, secure and fast.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Every time a user sends a file, the recipient will see a notification containing important information, like the filename, file type, size and who is sending the content, so that you can decide to accept the file or not.</p>
<p>All users accepting the transfer would get access to a private live chat room where they could talk to each other and keep track of the transfer progress.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/teleport?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">user interface video</a>!</p>
<h2>Teleport is easy.</h2>
<p><strong>Sharing files with Teleport is really easy</strong>, just select one or more friends to send a file and the content you want to share and Teleport will create a P2P channel where all your friends will connect.</p>
<p>We also thought about mobile technology. <strong>You can select the device on which you want to download the file.</strong> So if you are on the bus and your friend is sending you 1GB, just select your home PC and download it to that device remotely.</p>
<h2>Teleport is private.</h2>
<p>We want to emphasize that, <strong>WE WILL NOT SELL YOUR DATA</strong>. Teleport is private; we are not going to sell your data, your transfer information, or anything else.</p>
<p>We believe that it’s better for you to have control over your data, and for that reason, we are not doing business with your content.</p>
<p><strong>You and your content are safe. Trust us.</strong></p>
<h2>Teleport is secure.</h2>
<p>Every time you start a channel to share content with your friends, only you and your selected friends can access that room. <strong>The data is sent in sliced encrypted packages</strong>, and yes, it’s really hard to break that security.</p>
<p>We really care about your privacy and security. We think that this is really important in file transfers.</p>
<h2>Teleport is fast.</h2>
<p><strong>P2P is the fastest way to share content</strong>. All your Teleport transfers will be in a P2P mesh where, the more users the merrier. Also, video and audio will be offered in streaming to allow you to play it during the download process.</p>
<p>Do the math. With ten users in a P2P mesh and an average upload rate of 300KB/s, you can download at just 3MB/s.</p>
<p>Forget waiting for uploads. With Teleport you don’t need to upload anything to the cloud because you are uploading content directly to your friend or your device.</p>
<p><strong>And we take care of connection problems by caching the packages locally</strong> in order to reconnect when you are back online.</p>
<h2>What do you get?</h2>
<p>Once we finish developing the application, we will be offering Free accounts with 2GBs monthly data transfer on one connected device. For our contributors, <strong>we’re offering Teleport Pro accounts with unlimited monthly data transfer and three simultaneously connected devices</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, we’re offering you the possibility to <strong>be a beta tester and try the application before it hits the market</strong>. You could even improve Teleport with suggestions!</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>we have a special perk called “The Higgs Partner”</strong> that will allow you to place a banner on our website for one full year, provide Teleport Pro accounts for all the employees and also early information about our future plans and upcoming Enterprise accounts.</p>
<h2>Your help is our success.</h2>
<p>Currently, Teleport is just a prototype, but there’s a lot of work to do and with your help, we can make Teleport a reality. <strong>If you want to share files like you always wished for, then help us</strong>.</p>
<p>We need funding to build the back-end, develop and design the tablet and PC version, lease servers, and buy software licenses to finalize the development of Teleport. We have a lot of work to do, and we estimate we will need three or four months of full-time development.</p>
<p>Here is our budget estimation:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Back-end developers: US$28,000</li>
<li>2 Front-end developers (tablet and PC): US$28,000</li>
<li>1 Designer (tablet and PC): US$7,200</li>

<li>Legal advisors: US$5,600</li>
<li>9% IndieGoGo and taxes: US$6,200</li>
</ul><p>With the extra funds, <strong>we plan to hire more developers, add other platforms, run advertising campaigns, and add more features that we will unveil if we reach the goal</strong>. You will be amazed by those new features!</p>
<p>We are open to any suggestion, so please, <strong>let us know what you think about Teleport</strong>.</p>

<p>The tools of communication almost evolve on a daily basis, however the way of communicating over the Internet has barely changed at all in the past 10 years. We will change that! With elaico it will be possible not only to see and talk to one another, but also to feel and touch one another. Falling in love over the Internet is nothing unusual these days. Therefore long distance relationships are more common in our society. But it´s not easy to keep them going, because of the lack of intimacy and sensuality. The missing piece between the needs of today‘s generation and state-of-the-art technology is called elaico. We will close this gap and give people all over the world a tool to feel real emotion over the Internet.</p>

<p>The Active Alarm is the first and only automatic device that can prevent home fires.  Simply plug your stove into the Active Alarm and then plug the Active Alarm into the wall. Once your smoke alarm sounds, the Active Alarm hears the alarm and cuts the power to the stove thereby preventing the fire.</p>
<div>
<h1>The Idea </h1>
<p>The Active Alarm was conceived by firefighter Peter Thorpe as he consistently went on fire calls where someone had left something cooking on the stove. Sometimes, the home or building is in flames. Peter thought: “there has to be a way to stop the fire once the smoke alarm is blaring before the fire starts.” </p>
<h1>What does the Active Alarm do?</h1>
<p>Active Alarm cuts off power to the heat source. Stove fires can smoke for hours before actually igniting into flame. The Active Alarm hears when the smoke alarm is activated and cuts the power to the stove. This removes the power source from the potential fire causing material and stops the fire before it starts. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/085/034/7d0413b68427a7baa1f98d8ccca34467_large.jpg?1343268318"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h1>Is the Active Alarm necessary?</h1>
<p>The number one location of home fires is in the kitchen. The number one cause of kitchen fires… unattended cooking. Have you ever left the kitchen with something cooking and forgotten about it? Have you ever left home wondering if you turned off the oven or stove? Have you experienced a home fire or know someone who has? <br/><br/>In the United States, over 150,000 fires are caused each year just by unattended cooking. These cooking fires cause over $750 million in property damage. Still other fires are caused by clothes dryers and other appliances. <br/><br/>By stopping the fire during the smoking phase, the Active Alarm can prevent these fires and save billions of dollars in property damage. There is no other fire prevention device that prevents the fire before it starts. <br/><br/>We think Smokey the Bear would be proud.</p>
<h1>Fire Scenario…</h1>
<p>If a fire starts in your home while you’re there, you’d probably hear the fire alarm and investigate the smoke. You may then call the fire department. If you’re not there, hopefully the neighbors notice the smoke from the house and call the fire department to drive over and put it out.  But with an Active Alarm, as soon as the fire alarm sounds, Active Alarm starts counting down from 3 minutes. If the smoke alarm stops sounding within 3 minutes or if you turn off the appliance, the Active Alarm knows you took care of it. Otherwise, Active Alarm cuts power to the appliance, thereby preventing a fire and stopping the smoke. </p>
<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>What if I accidentally set off my smoke alarm while cooking?</strong> <br/>The Active Alarm has an intelligent 3 minute delay that allows those of us who aren’t the best cooks to clear out the smoke before the Active Alarm cuts the power to the stove. The 3 minutes is plenty of time to clear out smoke or shut off the smoke alarm before the Active Alarm interrupts the power supply to the stove. </p>
<p><strong>How can I reset the Active Alarm?</strong> <br/>The Active Alarm is reset by flipping the breaker in your electrical panel off and back on again. This way you won’t have to pull out your stove if you need to reset the unit.</p>
<p><strong>What Kind Of Appliances Does The Active Alarm Work With?</strong> <br/>The device currently works with stove and oven units using 220 volt power. Our device currently doesn't work outside of the US or Canada. </p>
<p><strong>How Did You Develop Active Alarm?</strong> <br/>First, we created a bread board to figure out which circuit type would work best. Then, we moved into 110V circuit boards to get a basic feel for the space and components that would be required. After that, we created several 220V prototypes to get a sense of the look and the feel. Our next stage of development is to create a user-ready device. </p>
<h1>The Next (and final) Step</h1>
<p>We have made some amazing progress in developing the Active Alarm. We are now at the final stage of development. The funds raised using Indiegogo will go towards costs of finalized engineering, ETL certification, and mold and manufacturing costs. We have partnered up with a local design firm and lab for final design specs and a local manufacturing company to build the units. We are excited to be so close to the finish line of getting these built!</p>
<h1>Our Team</h1>
<p>The alarm concept was created by firefighter Peter Thorpe. He got together with his trusted engineering friends, Michael and Zack, who engineered the device. Then Rhett joined to help people learn about the device and bring it to as many homes in the U.S. as possible. </p>
<p>We need your help, Indiegogo! We have a working prototype already developed. We need your help to finalize the manufacturing of these devices. So tell someone you know who might think this device is cool or important. And above all, back us!</p>

<p>One of them was waiting for an important message, and she was
checking its phone every second.</p>
<p>Suddenly she asked ""Do you know what I need? Something to
alert me on missed call. Like the one I had on my old phone!""</p>
<p>Simple and clear!! A colorful light able to catch your
attention when needed.</p>
<p>After several trials, we finally developed the NotiMe with in
focus the reliability and robustness.</p>
<p>But you should bring it with you and when attached to your
phone/tablet it doesn't have to be cumbersome.</p>
<p>So we went through various designs until we matched the
perfect size. Not too small to lose it, not too big to feel it when the
phone is in your pocket.</p>
<p>But we are ambitious and with your help we can further
minimize it.</p>
<h4><b><i>WHY THIS CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT
FOR ME:</i></b></h4>
<p>This is my very first campaign and I spent a lot of time (more
than a year) designing and testing it.</p>
<p>There are different ways to contribute to this project. If you
can’t donate please share it with your friends and If they don’t buy it
telling they lost your message, then you have an chance to taunt him
for not contribute to this useful device.</p>
<p>To contribute, please share this project with your friends.</p>
<p>The more people share this project, the more chance we have to
reach the goal.</p>

<p>Instruction:</p>
<p>Take your NotiMe</p>
<p>Just plug it in your USB port</p>
<p>Do whatever you want, free to not miss anything again.</p>
<p>Well, you might think that this section is too short, but
really there is nothing more to say.</p>
<p>Just one simple step. <b>Plug it in your USB port.</b></p>
<p>Do you want to know what is real outstanding?</p>
<p>Since it is a real multiplatform device, it can be
unplugged from pc and plugged in you tabled as your needs.</p>
<p>If you are a business man, you could benefit from NotiMe
notification:</p>
<p>Transport it with you and plug in your work computer to wait for an
email from your boss, go to have a lunch and bring it with you plugged
in your tablet and finally go back to home with your phone and call
back your girlfriend if you miss her call.</p>
<p>And what if you are a student?</p>
<p>Why you should miss a party or a news for the exams your will
have the day after? Use the NotiMe and get notified in time.</p>
<p>All these things are possible with just one device.</p>
<p>

<p>The NotiMe has been designed to be compatible with most
devices on the planet.</p>
<p>That’s why we choose to use the USB hardware as communication
way.</p>
<p>The NotiMe is also self-powered and thereby it doesn’t need
any additional power source; it takes energy directly from host.</p>
<p>To do so, the device you want to use with, must have an USB
HOST or USB OTG port.</p>
<p>The protocol layer changes in case it is for Android device or
other Operating Systems. On the latters the NotiMe is recognized as HID
device giving you a driver free device.</p>
<p>On Android platform you need a “bridge application” which has
been already developed and tested and will be published on Google Play
store as soon the campaign successful ends. This application catches
dedicated Intent from Android system and codifies it to be
understandable by the NotiMe device.</p>
<p>This application can be used by any user or developer which
wants to control the NotiMe giving you the abstraction level which you
deserve.</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT: No root access or special driver required. Just the
bridge application already developed </b></p>

<p>If you can connect to USB mouse/keyboard or read a USB pen, of
course you have compatible USB port.</p>
<p>Even if your device can't recognize an external mass storage,
you have a chance to use this fantastic device.</p>

<font color=""#990000"" size=""2""><strong></strong></font></div>","The Idea:We designed the NotiMe during a dinner with our friends.
One of them was waiting for an important message, and she was
checking its phone every second.
Suddenly she asked ""Do you know what I need? Something to
alert me on missed call. Like the one I had on my old phone!""
Simple and clear!! A colorful light able to catch your
attention when needed.
After several trials, we finally developed the NotiMe with in
focus the reliability and robustness.
But you should bring it with you and when attached to your
phone/tablet it doesn't have to be cumbersome.
So we went through various designs until we matched the
perfect size. Not too small to lose it, not too big to feel it when the
phone is in your pocket.
But we are ambitious and with your help we can further
minimize it.
WHY THIS CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT
FOR ME:
This is my very first campaign and I spent a lot of time (more
than a year) designing and testing it.
There are different ways to contribute to this project. If you
can’t donate please share it with your friends and If they don’t buy it
telling they lost your message, then you have an chance to taunt him
for not contribute to this useful device.
To contribute, please share this project with your friends.
The more people share this project, the more chance we have to
reach the goal.

The NotiMe instruction:

The NotiMe works as a simple USB device. It needs only an USB
Host or USB OTG port on your device.

Instruction:
Take your NotiMe
Just plug it in your USB port
Do whatever you want, free to not miss anything again.
Well, you might think that this section is too short, but
really there is nothing more to say.
Just one simple step. Plug it in your USB port.
Do you want to know what is real outstanding?
Since it is a real multiplatform device, it can be
unplugged from pc and plugged in you tabled as your needs.
If you are a business man, you could benefit from NotiMe
notification:
Transport it with you and plug in your work computer to wait for an
email from your boss, go to have a lunch and bring it with you plugged
in your tablet and finally go back to home with your phone and call
back your girlfriend if you miss her call.
And what if you are a student?
Why you should miss a party or a news for the exams your will
have the day after? Use the NotiMe and get notified in time.
All these things are possible with just one device.

Which apps are yet supported?

Thanks to the partnership with LightFlow we are proud to give
you the most natural, simple and COMPLETE notification system
you could ever imagine.
LightFlow fully support the NotiMe and provides you a plenty
of notification out of the box.
Just plug the device in your USB port and in a few second you

If you own more than one smart device, you are already familiar with messy, entangled cables that get easily lost.


The Cube was born out of the need to de-clutter our living and work spaces and offers you unparalleled flexibility in doing so. 4smarts has the pleasure to present you an all-in-one solution -- the charging system that combines the advantages of a wall charger, a docking station and a power bank.






The 4smarts Cube includes three main components; they can be used spearately or all togehter at the same time. The docking station can be plugged into either the wall charger or the power bank. This way, you can use the docking station even when you are on the move and charging will never be a problem again!



The powerbank can easily be charged by placing it on top of the wall charger. Its connection pins use state-of-the-art technology, so plugging it in is always accurate and charging - incredibly fast. All that you need to do now is throw away those annoying cables.




The 4smarts Cube embodies all the superlatives of device charging: high charging speed and an excellent electrical efficiency that makes it environment-friendly. Compared to a standard home charger, Cube has a charging output increased by 2000mAh. 


Its intelligent control system helps you save power or make the most of it when you really need it: its 4.2A output will be regulated if you use the Cube for more than 1 device at a time; when used for a single device, it will get maximum power and remarkably fast charging.


It's not only stylish, with a minimalist, urban design, but also very practical. This plug-and-play modular system allows you to charge all your devices in your home or office, on the go, without any cables and it can also be used as a docking station.

<br/>
</div> <p>Hello from Ludovico and Francesco!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are two Italian students, passionate about new technologies and watches. 
		
	
	
		</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Ludovico and Francesco are the creators of Adappt.<br/></p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>As soon as the Apple Watch was presented, we fell in love with its design and functionality.
<p>However, we soon realized that it had a limitation: the watchbands. Apple decided to offer only six different watchbands, and at a very expensive price! </p>
<p>This is why we created Adappt.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296233/files/20150315084456-two3.jpg?1426434296"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Adappt</h3>
<p>Adappt is a small adapter, that will let you use your Apple Watch with any standard watchband. On one side it will feature Apple’s proprietary plug, on the other one the classic plug used by any watch in the world. </p>
<p>Along with Adappt, we also offer a combination of adapter and watchband. You can get high quality rubber, leather or stainless steel bands in a wide variety of colors.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296198/files/20150315082713-output_Yo2RvI.gif?1426433233"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296033/files/20150315062328-Senzanome.png?1426425808"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Designed in Italy.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Versions</h3>
<div>Adappt will be available in two sizes; one for the 38mm, supporting 22mm watchbands, and one for the 42mm Apple Watch, which can mount bands up to 24mm.<br/>
</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1297321/files/20150315165955-versions.jpg?1426463995"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div> <p></p>
<p>We are working very hard to manufacture Adappt with high quality materials, to make Adappt look just like it’s part of your Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Adappt will be available in plastic, anodized aluminium, stainless and gold plated steel. Each version will come in two colors, just like the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thanks to high quality materials, Adappt will match perfectly your Apple Watch. Our aluminum is anodized through an electro-chemical process that creates a porous surface, then coated with a dye, to look and feel exactly like the Sport edition versions, Silver and Space Grey Aluminum. </p>
<p>Thanks to Adappt, the Sport is not limited to sports anymore. Match it with a classic band and you will be able to use your Apple Watch Sport in any occasion.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1297342/files/20150315170807-classy.jpg?1426464487"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For the Stainless Steel version, we will use an alloy of stainless steel with the best strength/corrosion resistance ratio, we will then polish it to give it a clean mirror look, just like the Apple Watch’s Stainless Steel, and a darker elegant color, for the Space Black Stainless Steel, or we will plate it with yellow or rose gold for the Gold version. </p>

</div> <p>We are almost ready to begin production. Our team managed to build accurate 3D models of the Apple Watch, to then produce the design of Adappt. We found reliable manufacturers for each material, that will help us deliver a well finished product.</p>
<p>The current models are really precise, although some modifications will be needed, as we don’t know the exact dimensions yet, but most of the work is already done!</p>

</div></div>","The Team




 Hello from Ludovico and Francesco!

We are two Italian students, passionate about new technologies and watches. 
		
	
	
		




Ludovico and Francesco are the creators of Adappt.


As soon as the Apple Watch was presented, we fell in love with its design and functionality.
However, we soon realized that it had a limitation: the watchbands. Apple decided to offer only six different watchbands, and at a very expensive price! 
This is why we created Adappt.




Adappt
Adappt is a small adapter, that will let you use your Apple Watch with any standard watchband. On one side it will feature Apple’s proprietary plug, on the other one the classic plug used by any watch in the world. 
Along with Adappt, we also offer a combination of adapter and watchband. You can get high quality rubber, leather or stainless steel bands in a wide variety of colors.




Designed in Italy.
   Versions
Adappt will be available in two sizes; one for the 38mm, supporting 22mm watchbands, and one for the 42mm Apple Watch, which can mount bands up to 24mm.

 
We are working very hard to manufacture Adappt with high quality materials, to make Adappt look just like it’s part of your Apple Watch.
Adappt will be available in plastic, anodized aluminium, stainless and gold plated steel. Each version will come in two colors, just like the Apple Watch.


Thanks to high quality materials, Adappt will match perfectly your Apple Watch. Our aluminum is anodized through an electro-chemical process that creates a porous surface, then coated with a dye, to look and feel exactly like the Sport edition versions, Silver and Space Grey Aluminum. 
Thanks to Adappt, the Sport is not limited to sports anymore. Match it with a classic band and you will be able to use your Apple Watch Sport in any occasion.


For the Stainless Steel version, we will use an alloy of stainless steel with the best strength/corrosion resistance ratio, we will then polish it to give it a clean mirror look, just like the Apple Watch’s Stainless Steel, and a darker elegant color, for the Space Black Stainless Steel, or we will plate it with yellow or rose gold for the Gold version. 








Status of the project & next steps




 We are almost ready to begin production. Our team managed to build accurate 3D models of the Apple Watch, to then produce the design of Adappt. We found reliable manufacturers for each material, that will help us deliver a well finished product.
The current models are really precise, although some modifications will be needed, as we don’t know the exact dimensions yet, but most of the work is already done!


We have also printed some 3D prototypes. Please note this are just prototypes made with raw plastic, and they don't have the closure mechanism, that will be implemented in the final version.




  
Packaging solutions
We are still working on the possible packaging solutions. At the moment we have decided to include in every Adappt a basic packaging solution which is flat, ecological and shipping-friendly. But if you wish a more sophisticated packaging, we offer that option as well, you can select the ""Premium packaging"" perk.
Anyways we will share both solutions with you very soon!

  Risks & Challenges There are always risks that can delay the process of delivering Adappt to you. We think you should know exactly what some of these are. 
Production: When making a new product, it’s possible to encounter obstacles in the technical aspect of the process. In case this happens, we will do anything we can to overcome them, and enhance the quality of the product. 
Supply: Adappt is made of different components, and each one of them comes from a different supplier. If only one of these suppliers has a long leadtime, there can be a delay for the entire production. 
Shipping: There is always a risk of the product getting stuck in customs, either when we are receiving the products from the factory or shipping them to you. We are prepared for this, and hopefully there won’t be any delays.


Why you should contribute
We are offering Adappt at a launch price to all of our contributors, to let everybody make Apple’s most personal device even more personal.

We are really excited about this, and we hope you are too. Now we need your help to bring Adappt to life.
As a supporter you will get your Adappt at a very special price! So please consider backing our project, and share it with your friends.
*Reminder: if we don't reach our goal you will be automatically get a refund.

<h3>Me, Myself and 3D</h3>
<p>In order to help you truly understand how I got into this relationship with 3D, let me give you a little background story.</p>
<p>Hi folks. My name is Sunny Sachdev and I'm the creator of the FLIP 3D.</p>
<p>It's funny - I have to admit that I used to dismiss 3D as just a shallow gimmick. But all that changed one day when I stumbled across my old View Master reels.</p>
<p>I picked it up again and starting viewing a scenic reel of some National Park. The images on there blew me away. What the 3D photographers achieved with these reels had inspired me.</p>
<p>I was hooked! I went on a 3D bender - collecting vintage View Masters and reels, day and night looking on eBay for my next fix. I suddenly found myself immersed in 3D photography, learning the principles and taking every opportunity to experiment. </p>
<p>You know how when you're somewhere beautiful and no matter how much you try to capture it on a camera, it never does it justice? (No I'm not a bad photographer) </p>
<p>With 3D photography, I captured it. That's when I knew that 3D could be something amazing.</p>
<h3>Experimental as anything</h3>
<p>I wanted 3D on my smart phone to take with me everywhere. And to my surprise there were already a handful of iPhone 3D viewers already on the market. <br/><br/>After some trial (and error) I found that half of them were bulky add-ons that were very impractical to carry around and the other half that boasted glasses-free options sacrificed quality and offered extremely limited viewing angles.<br/><br/>I had to make my own!</p>
<h3>A Modern View Master</h3>
<p>When I set out to design this product, the goal was to make 3D super accessible and easy - viewing 3D content a natural part of life. No need for extra peripherals or special displays. <br/><br/>Just you and 3D, in bed together and loving it.</p>

<p>STRETCH GOALS - we will start working on other popular phone models and an android app.</p>

<h3>A WHOLE NEW WORLD</h3>
<p>My main goal with Flip3d is to bring 3D to the mainstream and allow the masses to create and consume 3D content with extreme ease. Hence it's a case, it stays with you 24/7. And it looks cool too. At least I think so :)</p>
<p>I've been getting enquiries regarding the high budget. Here's why: what we are trying to do here is to create a new 3D culture in the mainstream. I don't just want to release a case - just a piece of plastic with lens on it. I want to release a new subculture - the case coupled with the App I'm creating makes the iPhone a super powerful tool.</p>
<p>What I'm creating is basically Instagram 3D COMPREHENSIVE edition. I will teach<br/>the masses how to take 3D photos with a fun interactive game then when you're<br/>ready, you can create and upload 3D photos. Post them to your wall and follow<br/>other 3D photographers.</p>
<p>ALL IN ONE APP. We need to create exceptional user interface along with a team<br/>to create, maintain and improve upon it. Basically making 3D photography<br/>virtually NATIVE to the iPhone.</p>

STRETCH GOALS - we will start working on other popular phone models and an android app.


A WHOLE NEW WORLD
My main goal with Flip3d is to bring 3D to the mainstream and allow the masses to create and consume 3D content with extreme ease. Hence it's a case, it stays with you 24/7. And it looks cool too. At least I think so :)
I've been getting enquiries regarding the high budget. Here's why: what we are trying to do here is to create a new 3D culture in the mainstream. I don't just want to release a case - just a piece of plastic with lens on it. I want to release a new subculture - the case coupled with the App I'm creating makes the iPhone a super powerful tool.
What I'm creating is basically Instagram 3D COMPREHENSIVE edition. I will teachthe masses how to take 3D photos with a fun interactive game then when you'reready, you can create and upload 3D photos. Post them to your wall and followother 3D photographers.
ALL IN ONE APP. We need to create exceptional user interface along with a teamto create, maintain and improve upon it. Basically making 3D photographyvirtually NATIVE to the iPhone.

<p><b>_______________________________________________________________________<br/></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Wirelessly control the camera on your iPhone and iPad!
Take your self-portraits to the next level.
Just POINT, and CLICK to capture.</b></p>

<h1>
<b>The Problem:</b> </h1>
<p>Are you tired of
taking self-photos from an arm's length and cropping half  of your
face out by accident? 
</p>
<p>Q: Are you tired of
the stigma and poor results from taking a selfy in the mirror?<br/>Q: Are you looking
for an alternative to setting the timer and running to make it into a
group photo?<br/>Q: Are you looking for a way to capture great candid
memories? </p>
<p>If you answered
<i><b>YES</b></i> to any of these questions then you probably need <i><b>SelfPic Pro</b></i>.<br/></p>

<h1>
<b>The Solution:</b> </h1>
<p>SelfPic Pro is a
wireless remote trigger that allows you to activate the shutter
release on your iPhone and iPad camera without any installation or
special software. <br/></p>
<p><b>It can even work through a layer of clothing, so you can keep it in your pocket and capture the perfect photo!</b></p>
<h1><b>How it Works:</b></h1>
<p>SelfPic Pro is
made up of 2 parts: the Transmitter and the Receiver. While pointed
at the Receiver, the Transmitter emits an Infrared signal at the push
of a button.  The Receiver connects to your iPhone or iPad through
the audio head-phone jack. You can aim the Transmitter at the back or
front of the Receiver.  No Special software or installation
required.<br/><br/><b><i>Photo: </i></b> Using the standard Camera App, when the
Receiver is signaled by the Transmitter, a photo is taken. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Video:</i></b>  If the
Camera App is in Video mode, the press of the Transmitter button will
both START and STOP the recording function, allowing you to capture
video remotely. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/35681/files/20130826174941-instructions_with_numbers.jpg?1377564581"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Technical</b>: Technically speaking, the SelfPic Pro utilizes the same 
control that the typical Apple headphone volume control uses. Just as 
you can press the Volume+ button on the side of your iPhone to trip the 
shutter of your camera, the Volume+ button on your stock Apple 
headphones does the same. Within the mobile device, the receiver 
inserted into the head-phone jack of the iPhone or iPad acts the exact 
same way, with the addition of a wireless transmitter. Its simple 
integration for a very powerful line of Apple products. We really have 
Apple to thank for that availability.</p>

<b>Funding and Delivery</b>: </h1>
<p>By backing
this project, you are essentially pre-ordering the SelfPic Pro. Once
the project has been successfully backed, the pledges will be used to
cover the costs of tooling and materials to execute a successful mass
production. Any extra capital raised will also be put towards the
possibility of developing a smaller PCB which would in-turn make the
Receiver smaller for potential future models of the SelfPic
Pro.  Based on estimates, by the manufacturer in Dongguan, China, products will be all ready to ship within 4 weeks after successful completion of the project! Thank you so
much for all the interest and support. The project would not be
possible without you!</p>
<h1>Production and Fulfillment:</h1>
<p><b>Our partners in production:</b>
 A Chinese electronic factory in Dongguan, China has been enlisted to 
carry out the production aspects of this project. Initial contact with 
them came about through existing business contacts also from 
manufacturing of customized electronic goods. They are responsible for 
transforming the concept into a functional reality. Close collaboration 
between the creators and the production partner has resulted in a joint 
effort that is turning out a fun and functional product hopefully at the
 lowest price possible.<br/><b><br/>Why it's possible:</b> Full-quality units are already a reality, but a large first mass production run is required to bring the retail costs down as low as possible in order to make SelfPic Pro available to the retail market in the the future and also to make the initial splash into the market a substantial one. The creators of
 SelfPic Pro are experienced carrying through projects from conceptualization to execution, but your support is needed to make SelfPic Pro available to everyone. Electronic manufacturing is left to 
the experts on this one; the manufacturing partner. We just need your support financially to take SelfPic Pro to the next step. We also appreciate your shameless plugs on your blogs, forum pages, and gadget review sites. We thank you in advance!<br/><br/>Our production has progressed as follows and has all been attained in during 2013:<br/><br/><b>CURRENT STAGE: #7</b><br/><br/><b>1.

<h1>Our Story:</h1>
<p>The
 creators of this projects are experienced models who have traveled the 
world spending much time in front of the camera. Always needing to take 
new updated ""snap shots"" and ""casting videos"" for potential bookings 
from remote locations, too many hours were spent running back and forth 
to the camera, working on framing the shot and pressing the shutter 
button on a timer. Such activity gave rise to SelfPic Pro. The perfect 
solution... no matter the reason you need to control you camera 
remotely. Combining their experience with self-shot photos, the creators
 mixed in their ingenuity and production know-how to come up with a fun 
product that is highly functional and quite useful. Having championed 
some great start-up concepts in the past, Taber Maier and Pierce Fabian 
hope to continue to bring fun and useful products to everyone...this 
time through Indiegogo.<br/><br/>An existing relationship between the creators and the 
manufacturing partner has created quite the partnership for this project
 based on mutual respect underlined by legal agreement. The true value 
in the product, in our opinion, is captured by the functionality and the
 real-life problem that SelfPic Pro offers a solution to. Creative, 
out-of-the-box thinking within the parameters of technological possibilities is what this project is all about. Remote controls have 
existed for years for all sorts of products including consumer cameras, 
but never one specifically for the iPhone and iPad; the most used camera
 in the world!<br/></p>

Challenges: 
</h1>
<p>-From what we know about manufacturing over-seas, production 
delays are a very real possibility, and so are mis-shipments and flawed 
product. By funding this project we hope to minimize errors on the mass 
produced future retail units.</p>
<p>-Delays in shipping domestically and internationally are always a 
factor....like when Apple launches a new product and FedEx's efforts 
elsewhere come to a standstill.</p>
<p>-Starting new overseas manufacturing with a factory always takes some
 time to get rolling since they too work harder for loyal customers, so 
we hope that with this project we can develop a long-lasting 
relationship with our current manufacturer and ensure delivery times and
 prices stay within reasonable limits.</p>

_______________________________________________________________________

Wirelessly control the camera on your iPhone and iPad!
Take your self-portraits to the next level.
Just POINT, and CLICK to capture.




The Problem: 
Are you tired of
taking self-photos from an arm's length and cropping half  of your
face out by accident? 

Q: Are you tired of
the stigma and poor results from taking a selfy in the mirror?Q: Are you looking
for an alternative to setting the timer and running to make it into a
group photo?Q: Are you looking for a way to capture great candid
memories? 
If you answered
YES to any of these questions then you probably need SelfPic Pro.














The Solution: 
SelfPic Pro is a
wireless remote trigger that allows you to activate the shutter
release on your iPhone and iPad camera without any installation or
special software. 
It can even work through a layer of clothing, so you can keep it in your pocket and capture the perfect photo!
How it Works:
SelfPic Pro is
made up of 2 parts: the Transmitter and the Receiver. While pointed
at the Receiver, the Transmitter emits an Infrared signal at the push
of a button.  The Receiver connects to your iPhone or iPad through
the audio head-phone jack. You can aim the Transmitter at the back or
front of the Receiver.  No Special software or installation
required.Photo:  Using the standard Camera App, when the
Receiver is signaled by the Transmitter, a photo is taken. 

Video:  If the
Camera App is in Video mode, the press of the Transmitter button will
both START and STOP the recording function, allowing you to capture
video remotely. 





Technical: Technically speaking, the SelfPic Pro utilizes the same 
control that the typical Apple headphone volume control uses. Just as 
you can press the Volume+ button on the side of your iPhone to trip the 
shutter of your camera, the Volume+ button on your stock Apple 
headphones does the same. Within the mobile device, the receiver 
inserted into the head-phone jack of the iPhone or iPad acts the exact 
same way, with the addition of a wireless transmitter. Its simple 
integration for a very powerful line of Apple products. We really have 
Apple to thank for that availability.
The infrared transmitter 
technology is not some cold-war secret. It's the same as is used for your TV remote. The power-source is a 3V CR2032 lithium battery that comes with the 
unit, and is replaceable.

I made the current case for my portable by thermoforming clear acrylic plastic in my oven using a hand carved, unsymmetrical wooden mold. Not the most professional way to make a case.

<h2>Why do I Need Security?</h2>
<p>As our mobile devices become more powerful and essential to our daily lives, they’re increasingly used for more valuable tasks, like banking and shopping, and are, therefore, growing exponentially more vulnerable to a wide variety of online predators. In order to protect yourself and your family from known and unknown threats, you need to be aware of the range of security risks and how to prevent them. Data security is a complicated and rapidly changing space, and, unless you are a mobile security professional, you may find the challenge overwhelming. This is exactly why we are using Android 5.0 Lollipop for its encryption capabilities and the Tor network for secure online communication. Both of these open source systems provide the most robust and easy-to-use security available globally.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1148178/files/20150113162724-Kids_with_BOSS.png?1421195244"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>What is Tor?</h2>
<p>Tor is free software and an open network (available as “Orbot” on Android) that helps you defend against traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security. <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en</a></p>
<p>“Orbot is the only app that creates a truly private internet connection. As the New York Times writes, “When a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where or whom it’s from.” Tor won the 2012 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award. <a href=""https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/</a></p>
<p>“ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES: Orbot is the safest way to use the Internet on Android. Period. Orbot bounces your encrypted traffic several times through computers around the world, instead of connecting you directly like VPNs and proxies. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.” <a href=""https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/</a></p>
<h2>Who Uses Tor?</h2>
<p>A wide variety of people from all walks of life use Tor. These include journalists, military personnel, law enforcement officers, corporate executives, activists, and whistleblowers. Tor serves a valuable role in the free exchange of ideas on a global level. Families use Tor to communicate globally when some members may have limited access to online communication due to geographically/nationally enforced Internet restrictions. <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en</a></p>

<p>At BOSS Phone, we have discerned the best available technologies on the market and combined them to create a no-compromises super phone. We have chosen to operate on open source Android 5.0, the most widely used and frequently updated OS with the most developers and applications. BOSS Phone is the first device to include Tor installation and functionality from the manufacturer level. At BOSS, we believe consumers shouldn’t have to be security professionals or programmers to benefit from the same level of privacy the experts use. When you support BOSS Phone, you’re helping us both to fund the initial production run and crowdsource the market validation of high value superphones.</p>

<h2>About The Company: BOSS Phone Story</h2>
<p>BOSS Phone came to be over the course of the last three years when David and I founded NEO3DO. Our experience in designing, manufacturing and marketing the NEO3DO tablet revealed the trend towards building Android devices for the way people actually want to use them. Smartphones and tablets have evolved over the last few years into devices people use to take and share photos, watch and share videos, browse the Internet, participate in e-commerce, post to social media and (occasionally) make phone calls.</p>
<p>In May 2014, David made a video at his brother’s wedding in Turkey and wanted to share it on Youtube with friends and family back in the US. Unfortunately, he found out the Turkish government had mostly shut down the Internet due to political issues. Upon returning to the US, David researched how he could have posted the video and learned about the Tor network. The Tor network provides geographic and individual anonymity which allows individuals to communicate in private on a global level.</p>
<p>The Tor network and application are available for free, but unless you are knowledgeable about, and comfortable in, “jailbreaking” your Android device, you will not get the full benefit of Tor across all Internet traffic on the device. We found that no current smartphone manufacturer offers Tor preinstalled at the root directory level, so we saw an opportunity to provide an easy-to-use smart phone with Tor security built in from at the factory level.</p>
<p>Since the June 2013 news regarding Edward Snowden and mass government surveillance programs, as well as the 2013 Target hack and other financial data breaches have become wide-spread, smartphone buyers have expressed an interest in obtaining more secure devices. Android and Apple-based devices offer device level encryption, but device level encryption is only one level of security. Apple and Android devices have weaknesses and design compromises at the chip level, operating system level, network level, application level, and user level. Consumers are left wide open to various known and unknown data threats.</p>
<p>The topic of security is technically complex and confusing to most smartphone buyers. The need for security for most smartphone buyers is not to protect them from the government, but instead to protect them from hackers stealing financial information and data brokers tracking their personal data. We believe that the best approach to meet this security need is through integrating Tor to protect online communications.</p>
<p>The security features were the first design parameters we discussed and then we decided to start from scratch and design a phone from the ground up. We started by looking for the chip set that has the most performance for the least cost. Next we evaluated cellular and WiFi connection usage, then the display size and resolution, then cameras and battery life. The traditional phone model with subsidies from popular carriers doesn’t work for us. We believe in unlocked devices that can be used across multiple networks and countries with the capability to use dual SIM cards. The result is BOSS Phone. All of these technical specifications are based upon our personal experience and research into how people really use their smart phones.</p>
<p>The final step in bringing BOSS Phone to market is to present our vision of what a superphone should be to the Indiegogo supporters and media, in order to validate our design and value parameters. We have incorporated more features at a lower cost than Apple or Samsung. We believe that a large screen, high performance, low cost, easy-to use, secure superphone is needed and wanted by our supporters.  </p>
<br/><h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<p><b>Security - What Do I Need?</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Why do I need more security than my current smartphone offers?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> A: If you value your privacy and anonymity on the Internet and would like to protect your data and your family from unwillingly being accessed by data brokers and hackers, then you need to increase the level of security on your mobile devices.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: How do I stop all third parties from capturing my data without my permission?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: You cannot stop all third parties from capturing your data without your permission unless you get rid of your mobile device entirely. What you can do is minimize your exposure to malicious third parties by using BOSS Phone and its secure link to the Tor network.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: How much security is enough?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: The answer to this question depends on the type of data you transmit over the internet. For most law abiding citizens, the government data collection programs are not a threat. What is a threat is unauthorized third party access to your personal and financial practices online. Privacy by anonymity allows one to freely explore the lawful side of the Internet without nonconsensual or warrantless gathering of one’s browsing habits.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: If you are looking for absolute security and protection from unlawful acts, then we are not the company for you. We fully support lawful cooperation with all law enforcement agencies.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: You can research the available options on the Internet.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: What cellular networks and WiFi connections are available? LTE? 4G? 3G?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: We have selected a 3G GSM based 1900/2100 Mhz cellular connectivity to provide the best balance of device cost, bandwidth cost, cellular and data connectivity for our working prototypes. We need this successful IGG campaign to fund the development of 4G, LTE, and Edge versions of BOSS Phone.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">WiFi connections will be 802.11 (b)(g)(n)</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Why does anyone need Dual SIM?  Why is this important?  Am I going to have two phone bills now for one phone?  Or is this for international travel?  How hard is it to switch between SIM cards?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: The dual SIM feature allows users to have two different cell phone numbers which could be from one or two carriers, and/or one or two countries. Many people have both business and personal cell phones and we believe that, given the choice, most people would rather carry one device than two. Dual SIM cards give users the choice to select a different data and voice plan at their convenience. A user can have two SIM cards from two different countries to avoid international roaming charges and, while they will have two bills, they will likely be lower together than one with a single carrier. It is very easy to setup the dual SIM cards from within the settings menu in the Android operating system.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: The working prototype is 3G GSM compatible with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile carriers and our delivered product will be 4G LTE compatible with most major networks.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Can people take their SIM right out of an iPhone or android phone and put it into BOSS phone?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: Yes; if you have a 4G LTE SIM card and the carrier to mount the Mini or Micro SIM card into the standard SIM card slot.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Do you need a SIM card in BOSS Phone for it to work? </span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Why would the everyday consumer want to buy a BOSS Phone?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: People from all walks of life will prefer BOSS Phone to conventional devices; the first thing they’ll fall in love with is the extra large display of the pictures and videos they share with each other. Facebook comes to life with a larger screen. Anyone who wants the ultimate protection for their private information, and on behalf of their children and grandchildren, will prefer BOSS Phone over standard devices.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Why would a techy person want to buy BOSS Phone?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: Techies will love having the latest chip set, the highest display resolution, and the longest lasting battery life because they are always on their smartphones. BOSS Phone is the first superphone to deliver this combined set of specifications while doing so at a reasonable price, far below Apple and Samsung.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: BOSS Phone is a device designed and built to a higher set of specifications than the mass marketed, lowest common denominator phones &amp; tablets produced by Samsung. Our small size and addressable market allow us to make a more specialized device that meets the needs of discriminating consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Are there other 7” phones on the market?</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: The Blackphone is a solid device that takes a different approach to security at a higher price point in the market. The Blackphone takes a proprietary approach to modifying the Android OS and providing application level security, where BOSS Phone takes an open source and crowdsourced approach based on hardware and network security instead. Blackphone will require users to pay annual licensing fees for their proprietary applications while BOSS Phone will not.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: We are entrepreneurs who want to change the phone industry. Our goal is to make an easy-to-use phone that provides users with security against hackers and data brokers. Real security requires more than simply encrypting data at rest. Our strategy of using the best available network security with Tor incorporated at the root level provides the security not offered by major manufacturers. We are simply making the phone that we knew users would want based on the features, performance and value we want in our own devices.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: It isn’t that the major manufacturers don’t understand their customers; it is that they are designing products full of compromises rather than designing devices full of the best available hardware and software, regardless of the source. Major manufacturers are bound to their internal engineering for hardware and software. We can embrace all available technology whether proprietary, licensed or open source. We, as a smaller company, can produce a more feature-packed device with the best available components and software, while provide this package at a lower total cost than the bigger companies. We can make our customers happy with great features, performance, value and personal customer service. At Briggs &amp; Spriggs, you can talk to the owners and have your voice heard.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: Our process is more of a different strategic approach to designing and selecting the hardware and software components that allows us to mix proprietary, licensed, and open source components together in a way that Apple and Samsung will not or cannot. We are free to change chip sets, hardware security, operating system, and network security features as newer, better solutions come to market, rather than being tied into in house developed solutions. Our target is to sell in the single digit millions of units so we can make more specialized products that appeal to users outside of the mainstream, one-size-fits-most business model.</span></p>

Why do I Need Security?
As our mobile devices become more powerful and essential to our daily lives, they’re increasingly used for more valuable tasks, like banking and shopping, and are, therefore, growing exponentially more vulnerable to a wide variety of online predators. In order to protect yourself and your family from known and unknown threats, you need to be aware of the range of security risks and how to prevent them. Data security is a complicated and rapidly changing space, and, unless you are a mobile security professional, you may find the challenge overwhelming. This is exactly why we are using Android 5.0 Lollipop for its encryption capabilities and the Tor network for secure online communication. Both of these open source systems provide the most robust and easy-to-use security available globally.
What is Tor?
Tor is free software and an open network (available as “Orbot” on Android) that helps you defend against traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security. https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en
“Orbot is the only app that creates a truly private internet connection. As the New York Times writes, “When a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where or whom it’s from.” Tor won the 2012 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award. https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/
“ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES: Orbot is the safest way to use the Internet on Android. Period. Orbot bounces your encrypted traffic several times through computers around the world, instead of connecting you directly like VPNs and proxies. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.” https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/
Who Uses Tor?
A wide variety of people from all walks of life use Tor. These include journalists, military personnel, law enforcement officers, corporate executives, activists, and whistleblowers. Tor serves a valuable role in the free exchange of ideas on a global level. Families use Tor to communicate globally when some members may have limited access to online communication due to geographically/nationally enforced Internet restrictions. https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en


BOSS Phone’s embedded privacy firmware will operate at the root level, providing unprecedented levels of privacy.
This special network and browser are used by everyday people, the military, journalists, law enforcement, activists, and anyone who wants absolutely secure communications and Internet browsing.

BOSS Phone will be submitted to the Anonymity experts at The Guardian Project for consideration of certification.




Made by the same team that brought you the NEO3DO, a successfully crowdfunded, specialty 8"" tablet delivered to market in 2013.  We released the world's first glasses-free 3D tablet to market - NEO3DO - now available through many online retailers.





Today’s technology trends show: laptops are not selling, tablet growth is down, and phones are growing in popularity as people’s primary devices each year. But typical smart phones are prohibitively expensive, limited by carrier geography, and highly susceptible to hacking/information leaks. 

""If you support BOSS phone and within 30 days of delivery decide it is not right for you, we will offer a refund for the full amount received from your contribution."" 
- David Briggs CEO


What comes with BOSS Phone?

At BOSS Phone, we have discerned the best available technologies on the market and combined them to create a no-compromises super phone. We have chosen to operate on open source Android 5.0, the most widely used and frequently updated OS with the most developers and applications. BOSS Phone is the first device to include Tor installation and functionality from the manufacturer level. At BOSS, we believe consumers shouldn’t have to be security professionals or programmers to benefit from the same level of privacy the experts use. When you support BOSS Phone, you’re helping us both to fund the initial production run and crowdsource the market validation of high value superphones.
This campaign is All or Nothing. You will pay absolutely nothing unless we reach our threshold funding level of $150,000, which amount will prove there is enough interest to justify a full production of the full featured BOSS Phone.


We are a tried and true Las Vegas-based specialty device manufacturer with a successful crowdfunding campaign under our belt and glowing reviews from our contributors. Our full story can be read at the bottom.


BOSS Phone is a next generation device with double the processing power of an iPhone, faster Internet, a bigger screen, compatibility with most networks and onboard privacy for texts, email, calls and Internet browsing - all completely and seamlessly integrated at the factory level.




BOSS is a complete solution to the mass market need for ultra-secure, multi-functional phablet devices. BOSS is a tablet sized phone that’s ideal for sharing and viewing text, photos, and videos on a device that is sleek, beautiful, and simple to use. BOSS also contains privacy and security features that protect its users from unwanted surveillance by third parties, including the FCC.



Personal cellular data privacy is a huge concern for celebrities, entrepreneurs, and everyday consumers alike. In an era ripe with mass information leaks and security hacks, when personal/professional meta data is continuously fed to the FCC, people are ready for a robust, new, low-cost, unlocked device that provides innovative, geographically anonymous/encrypted communication, plus extra long-lasting battery life, dual SIM capability, and a beautiful 7” display - while granting users the freedom to choose their own carrier.

About The Company: BOSS Phone Story
BOSS Phone came to be over the course of the last three years when David and I founded NEO3DO. Our experience in designing, manufacturing and marketing the NEO3DO tablet revealed the trend towards building Android devices for the way people actually want to use them. Smartphones and tablets have evolved over the last few years into devices people use to take and share photos, watch and share videos, browse the Internet, participate in e-commerce, post to social media and (occasionally) make phone calls.
In May 2014, David made a video at his brother’s wedding in Turkey and wanted to share it on Youtube with friends and family back in the US. Unfortunately, he found out the Turkish government had mostly shut down the Internet due to political issues. Upon returning to the US, David researched how he could have posted the video and learned about the Tor network. The Tor network provides geographic and individual anonymity which allows individuals to communicate in private on a global level.
The Tor network and application are available for free, but unless you are knowledgeable about, and comfortable in, “jailbreaking” your Android device, you will not get the full benefit of Tor across all Internet traffic on the device. We found that no current smartphone manufacturer offers Tor preinstalled at the root directory level, so we saw an opportunity to provide an easy-to-use smart phone with Tor security built in from at the factory level.
Since the June 2013 news regarding Edward Snowden and mass government surveillance programs, as well as the 2013 Target hack and other financial data breaches have become wide-spread, smartphone buyers have expressed an interest in obtaining more secure devices. Android and Apple-based devices offer device level encryption, but device level encryption is only one level of security. Apple and Android devices have weaknesses and design compromises at the chip level, operating system level, network level, application level, and user level. Consumers are left wide open to various known and unknown data threats.
The topic of security is technically complex and confusing to most smartphone buyers. The need for security for most smartphone buyers is not to protect them from the government, but instead to protect them from hackers stealing financial information and data brokers tracking their personal data. We believe that the best approach to meet this security need is through integrating Tor to protect online communications.
The security features were the first design parameters we discussed and then we decided to start from scratch and design a phone from the ground up. We started by looking for the chip set that has the most performance for the least cost. Next we evaluated cellular and WiFi connection usage, then the display size and resolution, then cameras and battery life. The traditional phone model with subsidies from popular carriers doesn’t work for us. We believe in unlocked devices that can be used across multiple networks and countries with the capability to use dual SIM cards. The result is BOSS Phone. All of these technical specifications are based upon our personal experience and research into how people really use their smart phones.
The final step in bringing BOSS Phone to market is to present our vision of what a superphone should be to the Indiegogo supporters and media, in order to validate our design and value parameters. We have incorporated more features at a lower cost than Apple or Samsung. We believe that a large screen, high performance, low cost, easy-to use, secure superphone is needed and wanted by our supporters.  
Questions and Answers
Security - What Do I Need?
Q: Why do I need more security than my current smartphone offers?
 A: If you value your privacy and anonymity on the Internet and would like to protect your data and your family from unwillingly being accessed by data brokers and hackers, then you need to increase the level of security on your mobile devices.
Q: How do I stop all third parties from capturing my data without my permission?
A: You cannot stop all third parties from capturing your data without your permission unless you get rid of your mobile device entirely. What you can do is minimize your exposure to malicious third parties by using BOSS Phone and its secure link to the Tor network.  
Q: How much security is enough?
A: The answer to this question depends on the type of data you transmit over the internet. For most law abiding citizens, the government data collection programs are not a threat. What is a threat is unauthorized third party access to your personal and financial practices online. Privacy by anonymity allows one to freely explore the lawful side of the Internet without nonconsensual or warrantless gathering of one’s browsing habits.
A: If you are looking for absolute security and protection from unlawful acts, then we are not the company for you. We fully support lawful cooperation with all law enforcement agencies.
Q: How can I make an informed decision about security without becoming a security expert?
A: You can research the available options on the Internet. We have provided some links as resources. There are options from free to very expensive private networks with all proprietary hardware, operating systems and applications. We believe we are providing the lowest cost,  best combination of security that is easy-to-use for an average smartphone buyer.
Q: What is Tor and why should I care?
A: From the Tor website: “Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the like when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor's hidden services let users publish web sites and other services without needing to reveal the location of the site. Individuals also use Tor for socially sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse survivors, or people with illnesses.”  https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en
“Orbot is the only app that creates a truly private Internet connection. As The New York Times writes, “When a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where or whom it’s from.” Tor won the 2012 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award.” https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/
Tor is the most robust online security service and it is independent from government intervention. Over 500 million users have directly accessed the Tor network and 1.3 million people use Tor daily.
Q: Will BOSS Phone replace a Tor based tablet or work over WiFi?
A: Tor works on data based cellular connections and WiFi connections.
Cellular and WiFi Connections
Q: What cellular networks and WiFi connections are available? LTE? 4G? 3G?
A: We have selected a 3G GSM based 1900/2100 Mhz cellular connectivity to provide the best balance of device cost, bandwidth cost, cellular and data connectivity for our working prototypes. We need this successful IGG campaign to fund the development of 4G, LTE, and Edge versions of BOSS Phone.
WiFi connections will be 802.11 (b)(g)(n)
Q: Why does anyone need Dual SIM?  Why is this important?  Am I going to have two phone bills now for one phone?  Or is this for international travel?  How hard is it to switch between SIM cards?
A: The dual SIM feature allows users to have two different cell phone numbers which could be from one or two carriers, and/or one or two countries. Many people have both business and personal cell phones and we believe that, given the choice, most people would rather carry one device than two. Dual SIM cards give users the choice to select a different data and voice plan at their convenience. A user can have two SIM cards from two different countries to avoid international roaming charges and, while they will have two bills, they will likely be lower together than one with a single carrier. It is very easy to setup the dual SIM cards from within the settings menu in the Android operating system.
Q: What phone companies does BOSS Phone work with?
A: The working prototype is 3G GSM compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile carriers and our delivered product will be 4G LTE compatible with most major networks.  
Q: Can people take their SIM right out of an iPhone or android phone and put it into BOSS phone?
A: Yes; if you have a 4G LTE SIM card and the carrier to mount the Mini or Micro SIM card into the standard SIM card slot.
Q: Do you need a SIM card in BOSS Phone for it to work? 
A: Yes on the 3G, with standard and micro, or smaller with carrier. The 4G LTE will also use a SIM card.
Q: Can people just use BOSS Phone when they travel? 
A: BOSS Phone can be used any time, any place.
Q: How hard is it to get an international SIM card when you travel?  
A: It is very easy to buy a prepaid SIM card for travel.
Why should I buy BOSS Phone?
Q: Why would the everyday consumer want to buy a BOSS Phone?
A: People from all walks of life will prefer BOSS Phone to conventional devices; the first thing they’ll fall in love with is the extra large display of the pictures and videos they share with each other. Facebook comes to life with a larger screen. Anyone who wants the ultimate protection for their private information, and on behalf of their children and grandchildren, will prefer BOSS Phone over standard devices.
Q: Why would a techy person want to buy BOSS Phone?
A: Techies will love having the latest chip set, the highest display resolution, and the longest lasting battery life because they are always on their smartphones. BOSS Phone is the first superphone to deliver this combined set of specifications while doing so at a reasonable price, far below Apple and Samsung.
Q: Why should someone buy BOSS Phone over a Samsung Galaxy tablet?
A: BOSS Phone is a device designed and built to a higher set of specifications than the mass marketed, lowest common denominator phones & tablets produced by Samsung. Our small size and addressable market allow us to make a more specialized device that meets the needs of discriminating consumers.
Q: Are there other 7” phones on the market?
A: Yes, however none of them are offered by American companies in the US market. BOSS Phone is designed, sold and supported in the US.
Q: How is BOSS Phone different or better than the Blackphone?
A: The Blackphone is a solid device that takes a different approach to security at a higher price point in the market. The Blackphone takes a proprietary approach to modifying the Android OS and providing application level security, where BOSS Phone takes an open source and crowdsourced approach based on hardware and network security instead. Blackphone will require users to pay annual licensing fees for their proprietary applications while BOSS Phone will not.
Q: Why is buying a phone from a small company a better idea? 
A: Buying a phone from Briggs & Spriggs is a good idea for buyers who want the largest, fastest and most secure phone available. The user who does not want the one-size-fits-most smartphone will be rewarded with a unique feature set and performance capabilities at a reasonable price. Briggs & Spriggs have a proven track record of exemplary customer service and satisfaction with the NEO3DO.
Q: Why would two men want to go up against a billion dollar industry?
A: We are entrepreneurs who want to change the phone industry. Our goal is to make an easy-to-use phone that provides users with security against hackers and data brokers. Real security requires more than simply encrypting data at rest. Our strategy of using the best available network security with Tor incorporated at the root level provides the security not offered by major manufacturers. We are simply making the phone that we knew users would want based on the features, performance and value we want in our own devices.
Q: What don't cell phone companies understand about users that you do?
A: It isn’t that the major manufacturers don’t understand their customers; it is that they are designing products full of compromises rather than designing devices full of the best available hardware and software, regardless of the source. Major manufacturers are bound to their internal engineering for hardware and software. We can embrace all available technology whether proprietary, licensed or open source. We, as a smaller company, can produce a more feature-packed device with the best available components and software, while provide this package at a lower total cost than the bigger companies. We can make our customers happy with great features, performance, value and personal customer service. At Briggs & Spriggs, you can talk to the owners and have your voice heard.
Use Cases
Q: Since BOSS Phone is affordable enough to be a second device, what do we see as the best user fit for BOSS Phone?
A: BOSS Phone has the feature set, performance, and affordability to be every consumer’s only mobile communications device. Our goal is to help people shed excess devices by designing one that allows them to leave the phone, tablet, and laptop behind.  
Q: How does BOSS Phone fit in pockets?
A: BOSS Phone will fit in most front and rear pants pockets, as well as most purse and jacket pockets.
Q: How will BOSS Phone work for selfies?
A: The 2 mega pixel user facing camera is great for selfies, and both cameras auto capture if you flash a peace sign.  
How do we make a phone with this much value?
Q: How can you make a phone with this much value, when other unlocked phones cost $550? 
A: The Briggs & Spriggs business model is based on selecting the best value components for both hardware and software. We use the latest MediaTek chip and Android OS for maximum utility and updates along with the best in open source and crowd sourced utilities to keep overall software development and licensing costs down.  
Q: How did Briggs & Spriggs go through the product development process?
A: Our process is more of a different strategic approach to designing and selecting the hardware and software components that allows us to mix proprietary, licensed, and open source components together in a way that Apple and Samsung will not or cannot. We are free to change chip sets, hardware security, operating system, and network security features as newer, better solutions come to market, rather than being tied into in house developed solutions. Our target is to sell in the single digit millions of units so we can make more specialized products that appeal to users outside of the mainstream, one-size-fits-most business model.
Q: How do you make a phone?
A: The phone development process includes selecting a chip set with modem, internal memory, operating system, display size and resolution, front and rear cameras, speakers, battery capacity in mAh, and then fitting all the components together in a stylish, light and durable case.
Other questions
Q: What kind of customer support will you offer?
A: As a small company, we provide very personal customer support. We may be the only phone company where you can talk to one of the founders by Skype, email, or phone. We enjoy speaking directly with our customers to learn what they like and don’t like about our products and that guides our future development.
Q: Is the screen fixable if it breaks?
A: Yes, the screen can be repaired if it breaks at a cost to be determined. 
Q: How long does BOSS Phone take to charge?
A: BOSS Phone takes 5 hours to fully charge from a zero charge starting point.
Q: What's inside of the phone?
A: The core component of the prototype is a MTK6592 8 core chip and 3G GSM cellular modem, combined with 16Gb of internal memory. The production units will contain the absolute latest and greatest MTK6595 4G LTE chip.
Q: Is a 7 inch phone 7 inches across screen or from top to bottom? 
A: The display measures 7 inches diagonally from bottom left to top right.

<p>
</p><p>Arduissimo is a MultiCore Arduino project. It is optimized for Virtual Peripherals and is based on a Low Cost FPGA Arduino Board, which is the
central element of this project:</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/544679/files/20140430062349-LCFA_double.jpg?1398864229"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>The following picture gives an overview
of how to use it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/528633/files/20140423113557-flow.jpg?1398278157"" src="""" style=""""/></p>An Arduino board usually has a chip
with one processor, program and data memory and a set of peripherals.
You can program it using the Arduino IDE or other IDEs like the Atmel
Studio and you can use the Arduino language or other languages like
C++. You download the program through the USB interface for example.<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also true for this project. You
can use the enhanced Arduino IDE - called the Arduissimo IDE - or
alternatives like the Atmel Studio and languages like the  Arduino
language or C++ as well. The difference is, that you now have 16
processors available and more program and data memory to run your
code. You have to run a minimum of 4 processors. The system has a maximum system performance of 140MHz, which
means that when you use 4 processors, that each one of them is
running at 35MHz. The system boots from the SD-card when applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the performance increase and the
multicore solution are not the only new aspects here. The cool thing
is, that the system is optimized to execute virtual peripherals.
Virtual peripherals provide the functionality of common peripherals
like PWMs, serial interfaces etc, or any other freely user defined peripheral, but they only exist as software
code. 
<br/><br/></p>

</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span></p><p>If you want to use the Arduino IDE –
instead of Atmel Studio – then don't worry. You can assign
individual loops to individual processors or leave the multicore
handling to the compiler. It is as simple as using the original
Arduino IDE.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/528646/files/20140423113818-ide_compile.jpg?1398278298"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>An additional frame lets you setup the
project directory and structure. You can also define a set of sketch
files for your project.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/528648/files/20140423113848-ide_mc.jpg?1398278328"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span><p></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Virtual Peripherals</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Virtual Peripherals replace fixed
hardware peripherals with their functional counterparts in software
using software code and standard GPIOs (General Purpose Inputs and
Outputs). The concept of Virtual Peripherals is best explained with
an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/528651/files/20140423113916-virtual_peripherals_serial.jpg?1398278356"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The picture shows how signals of a
simple serial interface (cs (chip select), clk, data) change over
time to transmit data. It becomes clear, that most of the time the
signals remain constant. Only at specific time-points they alternate
their value. This is indicated with the little vertical arrows at the
timeline arrow. These actions can be handled by little software
threads which modify the right signals at the right GPIOs at the right
time.<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>This method can become very timing
critical when you need multiple (many) peripherals, but you only
have one processor for it (and for all the rest). This is where the
MultiCore solution of this project is perfect. I has many processors
available which quickly execute a thread when needed and then fall
into waiting/reset mode again. There is no fixed relation between a series
of threads for one Virtual Peripheral and one processor. Threads are
executed on the next available processors at a given time-point.</p>The Arduissimo project fully supports
Virtual Peripherals, it allows you to use an almost unlimited number of PWMs, I2Cs,
SPIs etc. on any of the 124 General Purpose IOs. You can still use the standard Arduino Peripherals (for code
compatibility for instance) and you can also use common predefined
Virtual Peripherals as easy as writing Arduino code in the Arduissimo
IDE. It is also possible to modify existing Virtual Peripherals or
define new Virtual Peripherals. You can also use a more professional
IDE like the Atmel Studio and other languages like C++ for it, as
shown in this picture:<p></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/535852/files/20140426130131-virtual_peripherals.jpg?1398542491"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>Maybe this MultiCore project optimized
for the embedded world, enabling Virtual Peripherals and using
standard languages and programming flows is one way how the future
might look like. So be one of the very first to support it.<br/><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Emulator and Virtual Prototyping</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Arduissimo project provides an
emulator. An overview of the GUI gives the next picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/528665/files/20140423114133-emulator.bmp?1398278493"" src="""" style=""""/></p>With this emulator you can debug your
Arduissimo code. It lets you set breakpoints and lets you step
through the code. You can check out special function register values
and display port waveforms. Also a stimulie pattern can be defined. The emulator is open source java code, so anybody can modify and improve :-) it.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/528669/files/20140423114210-virtual_prototyping.jpg?1398278530"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Sometimes emulators are limited. This
is why this project supports the idea of virtual prototyping. The
emulator is based on a cycle accurate C model which is automatically
derived from the MultiCore Arduissimo design. This cycle accurate C model can now be embedded in your simulation model of your robot or
environment model. This includes the processor and memory model of the Arduissimo processor design as well as the compiled program code. A demo project shows you how.<br/><br/><p></p>

</p><p>
</p><p><b>uPlug
(an outlook)</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>You
might have wondered what these extra headers and screws are for. They
are part of a Plug and Play system called uPlug, which is outside the

</p><p>
</p><p><b>The LCFA for FPGA Nerds</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Evaluation Board:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The low cost FPGA Arduino board can
also be used as a nice FPGA evaluation board. The user can download
his own FPGA configuration file through the USB interface. With an
additional adapter board, the JTAG pins can also be accessed when a
Xilinx
download cable should be used. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logic Analyzer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 576 MBit (@166MHz) SDRAM memory
combined with the HS-USB interface makes this board ideal to be used
as a logic analyzer. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OpenCores Remap:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some SoCs from opencores.org – like the MSP430, ARMs or the
OpenRisc1200 - are remapped on this board and will be released as
open source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Configurator:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The System Configurator helps you to
download a user's bitfile to the LCFA. It also lets you define your SoC to
be mapped on the LCFA. This also includes customer peripherals. It
does the complete compiling and tool handling for you. Since there is
still space available in the MultiCore Arduino design, it allows you
to add customer logic to the Arduissimo project.</p><p>The LCFA as a ""subwoofer"":</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/530471/files/20140424053327-monster3.jpg?1398342807"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Last but not least, an FPGA nerd can
also combine the LCFA with a standard Arduino (Due, Yun, etc.) and associated modules. This can be easily done by soldering some connection pins and using some screws. This picture shows a possible video frame grabber solution. The video input
stream is decoded into digital signals using a uPlug module, the FPGA
handles the video bitstream and might use the memories for data
storage. The communication to the Arduino Due can be based on any of
the serial interfaces for instance. Still there are plenty of IOs
available on the LCFA and on the Arduino Due. I'm sure you can imagine the endless possibilities of having the LCFA as a ""subwoofer"" beneath any of the existing Arduino boards.<br/><br/><p></p><p><b>CloudX</b></p><p>This is the official website <a href=""CloudX.cc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CloudX.cc</a>, where all the activity around the LCFA board is organized. It covers the Arduissimo related information, uPlug as well as pure FPGA based projects from me and hopefully from others as well. Feel invited.<br/><br/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Motivation</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The motivation for this project is the
realization of an idea I had as a student. This idea multiplies the
functionality of a design – like the one of a Multi-Processor for
example – BUT on a very much reduced area. I was certainly not the
only one having this idea, but I had a lot of fun to continue working
on this technique and I think it can be very useful in today's
embedded world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I call this now further developed
technique System Hyper Pipelining (SHP). This project is all about 
SHP, and instead of defining yet another evaluation board and
compiler flow etc., I made everything Arduino compatible and created
an Arduino board with an FPGA on it. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I programmed the FPGA that it provides
now 16 Arduino processors using SHP technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I think that it is really cool
to run more than one processor on a very small device like the Spartan-6 LX16, and I'm very
proud of demonstrating it, I thought I needed something even more
useful to convince you guys. So I developed the concept of virtual
peripherals on top of it. Almost all “embedded” programmer
emulated any kind of interface already on a CPU and the concept of
virtual peripherals is certainly not new, but when you combine it
with System Hyper Pipelining, it can be very efficient. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this project is all about some ideas
and about the right mix of various technologies. With this project I
want do demonstrate, that you can have a very efficient SHP-based
MultiCore solution already on an FPGA and that you as a user can
really benefit from it. So once the system is field proven then we
can think about making an ASIC out of it. Then it will be faster

<p></p></div>","Arduissimo

Arduissimo is a MultiCore Arduino project. It is optimized for Virtual Peripherals and is based on a Low Cost FPGA Arduino Board, which is the
central element of this project:The following picture gives an overview
of how to use it:


An Arduino board usually has a chip
with one processor, program and data memory and a set of peripherals.
You can program it using the Arduino IDE or other IDEs like the Atmel
Studio and you can use the Arduino language or other languages like
C++. You download the program through the USB interface for example.

This is also true for this project. You
can use the enhanced Arduino IDE - called the Arduissimo IDE - or
alternatives like the Atmel Studio and languages like the  Arduino
language or C++ as well. The difference is, that you now have 16
processors available and more program and data memory to run your
code. You have to run a minimum of 4 processors. The system has a maximum system performance of 140MHz, which
means that when you use 4 processors, that each one of them is
running at 35MHz. The system boots from the SD-card when applied.

But the performance increase and the
multicore solution are not the only new aspects here. The cool thing
is, that the system is optimized to execute virtual peripherals.
Virtual peripherals provide the functionality of common peripherals
like PWMs, serial interfaces etc, or any other freely user defined peripheral, but they only exist as software
code. 


IDE



If you want to use the Arduino IDE –
instead of Atmel Studio – then don't worry. You can assign
individual loops to individual processors or leave the multicore
handling to the compiler. It is as simple as using the original
Arduino IDE.An additional frame lets you setup the
project directory and structure. You can also define a set of sketch
files for your project.



Virtual Peripherals

Virtual Peripherals replace fixed
hardware peripherals with their functional counterparts in software
using software code and standard GPIOs (General Purpose Inputs and
Outputs). The concept of Virtual Peripherals is best explained with
an example:

The picture shows how signals of a
simple serial interface (cs (chip select), clk, data) change over
time to transmit data. It becomes clear, that most of the time the
signals remain constant. Only at specific time-points they alternate
their value. This is indicated with the little vertical arrows at the
timeline arrow. These actions can be handled by little software
threads which modify the right signals at the right GPIOs at the right
time.

This method can become very timing
critical when you need multiple (many) peripherals, but you only
have one processor for it (and for all the rest). This is where the
MultiCore solution of this project is perfect. I has many processors
available which quickly execute a thread when needed and then fall
into waiting/reset mode again. There is no fixed relation between a series
of threads for one Virtual Peripheral and one processor. Threads are
executed on the next available processors at a given time-point.The Arduissimo project fully supports
Virtual Peripherals, it allows you to use an almost unlimited number of PWMs, I2Cs,
SPIs etc. on any of the 124 General Purpose IOs. You can still use the standard Arduino Peripherals (for code
compatibility for instance) and you can also use common predefined
Virtual Peripherals as easy as writing Arduino code in the Arduissimo
IDE. It is also possible to modify existing Virtual Peripherals or
define new Virtual Peripherals. You can also use a more professional
IDE like the Atmel Studio and other languages like C++ for it, as
shown in this picture:

Maybe this MultiCore project optimized
for the embedded world, enabling Virtual Peripherals and using
standard languages and programming flows is one way how the future
might look like. So be one of the very first to support it.


Emulator and Virtual Prototyping

The Arduissimo project provides an
emulator. An overview of the GUI gives the next picture.


With this emulator you can debug your
Arduissimo code. It lets you set breakpoints and lets you step
through the code. You can check out special function register values
and display port waveforms. Also a stimulie pattern can be defined. The emulator is open source java code, so anybody can modify and improve :-) it.



Sometimes emulators are limited. This
is why this project supports the idea of virtual prototyping. The
emulator is based on a cycle accurate C model which is automatically
derived from the MultiCore Arduissimo design. This cycle accurate C model can now be embedded in your simulation model of your robot or
environment model. This includes the processor and memory model of the Arduissimo processor design as well as the compiled program code. A demo project shows you how.


Low Cost FPGA
Arduino (LCFA) Board

Finally, here is the specification of
the magic LCFA board we were talking about all the time.

Specification
details:- Size
98.5 mm x 60 mm- Power supply: DC 3.3V - 15V- Xilinx Spartan-6
LX16 CSG326 -2- EEprom for configuration file- High Speed USB,
FTDI HS2232HL (13 pins for “245 fifo sync” connected to  the
FPGA)- SDRAM Interface 1: 1x 256MBit, 4x 64MBit, 166MHz- SDRAM
Interface 2: 1x 64MBit, 166MHz- microSD-Card holder (4 pins
connected to FPGA)- 124 IOs:     - 4 IOs: 2,54mm header (e.g.
Raspberry Pi)     - 72 IOs: Arduino Mega footprint (44 IOs shared with
uPlug)     - 92 IOs: 8 uPlug connector slots (44 IOs shared with Arduino
Mega)- 50MHz oscillator- Reset switch- One magic yellow
LED- Power jack connector 2.1mm/5.5mm- 4 nice bumpers
Raspberry Pi Bridge



There are mounting holes to place the
Low Cost FPGA Arduino Board on top of your Raspberry Pi. With the
right connectors you can use one of the serial interfaces or the USB
interface. There is also an Arduissimo library available so that they
can nicely talk to each other via SPI or USB.

In
other words, your Raspberry Pi now has a flexible and large number of
peripherals, something you might have already dreamed of.


uPlug
(an outlook)

You
might have wondered what these extra headers and screws are for. They
are part of a Plug and Play system called uPlug, which is outside the
scope of this campaign, but maybe subject to the next one. To explain the usage of the uPlug slots on the LCFA, the following pictures are shown.




Various modules can be plugged into these slots. This
picture shows an example which you could use in your next drone project. It
has a video-in, Xbee,
a temperature and humidity sensor, a navigation switch, drivers for
servos and motors, a GPS module, a Wifi module, LEDs and keys, an SD
Card holder for your flight and video data for instance and a 3-axis
accelerometer and a 3-axis gyro.






With
this example you can control your little robotic car. It has a
bluetooth module, two USB master interfaces to control other devices, a
DAC, control modules for a stepper motors, DC motors and servos. It
also shows loudspeaker, a LCD display, PMOD, Poti, LEDs and Key modules.
And everything on top of a Raspberry Pi.If you want to use uPlug as a prototyping tool, then you can automatically generate the schematic of your system after having prototyped and tested it with uPlug.


The LCFA for FPGA Nerds

Evaluation Board:

The low cost FPGA Arduino board can
also be used as a nice FPGA evaluation board. The user can download
his own FPGA configuration file through the USB interface. With an
additional adapter board, the JTAG pins can also be accessed when a
Xilinx
download cable should be used. 


Logic Analyzer:

The 576 MBit (@166MHz) SDRAM memory
combined with the HS-USB interface makes this board ideal to be used
as a logic analyzer. 


OpenCores Remap:

Some SoCs from opencores.org – like the MSP430, ARMs or the
OpenRisc1200 - are remapped on this board and will be released as
open source.

System Configurator:

The System Configurator helps you to
download a user's bitfile to the LCFA. It also lets you define your SoC to
be mapped on the LCFA. This also includes customer peripherals. It
does the complete compiling and tool handling for you. Since there is
still space available in the MultiCore Arduino design, it allows you
to add customer logic to the Arduissimo project.The LCFA as a ""subwoofer"":


Last but not least, an FPGA nerd can
also combine the LCFA with a standard Arduino (Due, Yun, etc.) and associated modules. This can be easily done by soldering some connection pins and using some screws. This picture shows a possible video frame grabber solution. The video input
stream is decoded into digital signals using a uPlug module, the FPGA
handles the video bitstream and might use the memories for data
storage. The communication to the Arduino Due can be based on any of
the serial interfaces for instance. Still there are plenty of IOs
available on the LCFA and on the Arduino Due. I'm sure you can imagine the endless possibilities of having the LCFA as a ""subwoofer"" beneath any of the existing Arduino boards.CloudXThis is the official website CloudX.cc, where all the activity around the LCFA board is organized. It covers the Arduissimo related information, uPlug as well as pure FPGA based projects from me and hopefully from others as well. Feel invited.


Motivation

The motivation for this project is the
realization of an idea I had as a student. This idea multiplies the
functionality of a design – like the one of a Multi-Processor for
example – BUT on a very much reduced area. I was certainly not the
only one having this idea, but I had a lot of fun to continue working
on this technique and I think it can be very useful in today's
embedded world.

I call this now further developed
technique System Hyper Pipelining (SHP). This project is all about 
SHP, and instead of defining yet another evaluation board and
compiler flow etc., I made everything Arduino compatible and created
an Arduino board with an FPGA on it. 


I programmed the FPGA that it provides
now 16 Arduino processors using SHP technology.

Although I think that it is really cool
to run more than one processor on a very small device like the Spartan-6 LX16, and I'm very
proud of demonstrating it, I thought I needed something even more
useful to convince you guys. So I developed the concept of virtual
peripherals on top of it. Almost all “embedded” programmer
emulated any kind of interface already on a CPU and the concept of
virtual peripherals is certainly not new, but when you combine it
with System Hyper Pipelining, it can be very efficient. 


So this project is all about some ideas
and about the right mix of various technologies. With this project I
want do demonstrate, that you can have a very efficient SHP-based
MultiCore solution already on an FPGA and that you as a user can
really benefit from it. So once the system is field proven then we
can think about making an ASIC out of it. Then it will be faster
and even more cost efficient.The motivation is not “how can I make the Arduino better”, it is more or less “I would like to demonstrate a promising system architecture and I use the Arduino environment for it”.Key Messages

This project is not as fast as you might
expect when you hear the word “MultiCore”. This is because the

Only then synthesis is needed.Virtual Peripherals: It is not true that one processor executes one peripheral, so that the number of virtual peripherals is limited.

This is not a going to be a ""money for nothing"" or a charity project. I've created the perk levels so that you can give us the initial finantial boost we need and after the printer is here, you can collect your rewards.

The way I tought of rewarding you is by issuing 1 year discount vouchers, with variable percentages based on the amount funded. There won't be a limit to how much you can purchase or a number of times you can use them, meaning the more you use them, the more you benefit/save. You can use it to buy parts for you and/or your friends as well. Vouchers will be valid for any parts on the store, not just the ones we will be able to make with the printer. Keep in mind that the discounts will apply only to the parts themselves, not the shipping costs (maybe by the time the project ends Dhl will give us better rates). The expiry date will only start after the project has been finalized and each voucher will be linked to each contributors account on our store.

Even if you can't contribute monetarily, you can always spread the word to other people who may not have heard of this project and might want to contribute, this is a great help already.
To all of you who will help us, directly or indirectly, I thank you in advance.kind regards,Ricardo",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Do you keep it on your desk while you’re at work, or are you glued to it when you’re on a date or at home? Never want to go without it? We got it—we feel the same way!Never do? Don't worry, this is normal... But why? Well, it’s been scientifically proven that because the act itself is transparent and not specifically deliberate, it is harder to follow through. Another scientific study has proven that simply having our smartphone in sight, even if it is inactive, affects our cognitive resources and depletes our brain, which leads to stress and fatigue.Our work with sociologists has given us a chance to better understand our smartphone habits and behaviors, leading us to ponder how we can change our everyday smartphone use.The Yuman.Case is a smartphone capsule to free you from the distractions of your smartphone and helps you fully focus on the present moment. Learn to enjoy quality time with family and friends or boost your productivity. Just slip your smartphone into the Yuman.Case without having to touch or turn off any settings.The Yuman.Case is here to help you choose your moments of digital connection and will guide you as you form new smartphone habits through your own small selected breaks.     Thanks to Yuman.x, choose with just a simple gesture when to prioritize your digital or in-person connections. Take back control of your time and live how you want in your augmented present.The Yuman.Case has been designed to give you a break when you need it most. Place it on your desk when you’re at work, or make use of it at home to spend time with your loved ones. Thanks to the Yuman.Case, you can now preserve those little moments of human connection you so cherish:     While smartphones do have “airplane” and “do not disturb” modes, and turning them off is another option, we have to ask ourselves how often this actually happens. In fact, in-depth sociological research on smartphone usage behavior has demonstrated that an object must have a tangible, visible solution in order to be implemented. The Yuman.Case goes beyond the functions of airplane or do not disturb mode by illustrating in one simple gesture a break from your digital world. Cannot go without your phone? Don’t worry! The Yuman.Case is not about cutting you off completely from your digital world. It is simply here to help you find a different way to connect.Thanks to the Yuman.Case, you can explicitly demonstrate your full-on attention with a simple gesture and form new healthy habits!  How often do you check your phone while talking with your friends or playing with your kids? Take advantage of the priceless gift of time when you need it most by gently masking outside distraction without any digital interruption. Use the Yuman.Case at home to ensure some quality time alone or with family and friends. The Yuman.Case is here to show others you care. Working in a room without a phone increases your productivity by 26%.With the Yuman.Case, block out distractions for the time you need. Fewer distractions mean heightened attention and preserved focus, so you’re always living in the present. Carry the Yuman.Case to work to concentrate on a task, stay focused in a meeting, or demonstrate your consideration for a client.
 Stress, sleep disturbance, depression, FOMO: heavy phone use can have many effects on our morale and our brain. Using your smartphone heavily prevents the mind (and body) from resting and regenerating.But it is not your fault! Never-ending notifications from our phones constantly stimulate our minds and have created natural reflexes in users.Connect a different way with the Yuman.Case. Rest your body and mind for a moment and lower your stress level! Communication tools’ forever presence has upset the boundaries between our personal and professional life. This creates psychosocial risks of overwork. It’s no secret that smartphones can strongly infringe on your right to disconnect and well-being. Unfortunately, our current day and age of remote work isn’t helping, either.Slide your smartphone into the Yuman.Case when you get home or finish work to enjoy time for you.  Bluetooth, GSM, 3G, 4G, or even 5G: beyond its ability to contain electromagnetic fields, the impenetrable Yuman.Case secures anything from going in or out and is guaranteed to protect your data.   Got the biggest smartphone ever? Don't worry! We've got you covered! The Yuman.Case is compatible with every single smartphone on the market, even those equipped with a case.  The maximum dimensions for a phone are: 179x97x21mm     Expertly fashioned with natural oak and aluminum alloy, it blends natural and high-tech materials for a capsule that is sleek, modern, and durable.The unique opening mechanism created by the Yuman.x team is characterized by its sophisticated and high-tech design.Simply close the Yuman.Case lid and a flexible honeycomb foam specially developed by our team gently secures your phone and keeps it in place. Guaranteed protection no matter what.

<p> </p>
<p> Passionné de la première heure des produits Apple pour leur qualité et leur simplicité d'utilisation,  j'apprécie le design et le coté pratique des stations d'accueil.</p>
<p>Utilisateur quotidien de mon Iphone, mais aussi de l'Ipod et de l'Ipad, les coques de protection sont vite devenues indispensables....Mais la plupart des stations d'accueil ne permettent pas la connexion avec coque ! </p>
<p> Un peu perfectionniste, je souhaitais donc :</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Pouvoir recharger et synchroniser mes appareils Apple en station d'accueil, sans devoir, au préalable, ôter les coques de protection.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Améliorer la stabilité de l'appareil une fois positionné sur le dock, pour un meilleur confort d'utilisation</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Anticiper les nouveautés Apple dotées d'un connecteur 30 pins bien-sûr mais aussi lightning</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<p>Ce Dock est le premier produit E-fficient, j'espère qu'il correspondra à vos besoins et qu'il vous donnera envie de soutenir ce lancement.</p>
<p>Les 2 versions (30 pins et Lightning) sont proposées à la pré-commande, n'hesitez pas à partager ces infos au plus grand nombre. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> I’ve ever been passionate by Apple products: especially due to their high quality and efficiency. I appreciate the design and ergonomics of docks.</em></p>
<p><em>As a daily user of Iphone, Ipod and Ipad, I inevitably came to use protective shells… But most of the docks are unusable unless you remove the device from its case.</em></p>
<p><em>Said to be a perfectionist, my goal was:</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>To be able to recharge and synchronize my Apple devices on docking stations without having to remove them from their case before.</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Improve the stability for a better comfort of use</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Anticipate Apple’s novelties with </em><em>30 pins </em><em>connector, as well as the new Lightning.</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em> </em></p>
<p><em>This dock is the first E-fficient’s product. I sincerely hope that it will meet your needs and then, entices you to support its launch.</em></p>
<p><em>Both versions (30 pins and Lightning) are proposed for pre-order. Do not hesitate to share and spread widely this information.</em></p>

Adaptée à tous les  appareils Apple MEME avec coque de protection !


Proposée en connecteurs 30 pins ou Lightning 


D'une stabilité incroyable grâce à ses patins adhérants


 
Elegant, steady and efficient dock which:
Suits every Ios device, even held in case, bumper or protective shell
Is available in 30 pins or Lightning connectors model
Is incredibly steady thanks to its sticky and replaceable stamp

 
 
 
 Passionné de la première heure des produits Apple pour leur qualité et leur simplicité d'utilisation,  j'apprécie le design et le coté pratique des stations d'accueil.
Utilisateur quotidien de mon Iphone, mais aussi de l'Ipod et de l'Ipad, les coques de protection sont vite devenues indispensables....Mais la plupart des stations d'accueil ne permettent pas la connexion avec coque ! 
 Un peu perfectionniste, je souhaitais donc :
Pouvoir recharger et synchroniser mes appareils Apple en station d'accueil, sans devoir, au préalable, ôter les coques de protection.
Améliorer la stabilité de l'appareil une fois positionné sur le dock, pour un meilleur confort d'utilisation
Anticiper les nouveautés Apple dotées d'un connecteur 30 pins bien-sûr mais aussi lightning
 
Ce Dock est le premier produit E-fficient, j'espère qu'il correspondra à vos besoins et qu'il vous donnera envie de soutenir ce lancement.
Les 2 versions (30 pins et Lightning) sont proposées à la pré-commande, n'hesitez pas à partager ces infos au plus grand nombre. 
 
 
 I’ve ever been passionate by Apple products: especially due to their high quality and efficiency. I appreciate the design and ergonomics of docks.
As a daily user of Iphone, Ipod and Ipad, I inevitably came to use protective shells… But most of the docks are unusable unless you remove the device from its case.
Said to be a perfectionist, my goal was:
 
To be able to recharge and synchronize my Apple devices on docking stations without having to remove them from their case before.
Improve the stability for a better comfort of use
Anticipate Apple’s novelties with 30 pins connector, as well as the new Lightning.
 
This dock is the first E-fficient’s product. I sincerely hope that it will meet your needs and then, entices you to support its launch.
Both versions (30 pins and Lightning) are proposed for pre-order. Do not hesitate to share and spread widely this information.

<h1>About the TekTuk mini</h1>
<p><strong>How did the idea for the TekTuk mini come about?</strong>  Like most inventions, the idea for the <strong>TekTuk mini</strong> (and the TekTuk before it) came from a problem that needed to be solved.  Like most people; I have a ""moat"" around my bed which is filled with magazines, remotes, charging cords, and personal electronics.  One morning, my early rising girlfriend came back by the bed to say goodbye before she went to work.  She accidentally stepped on my iPad and broke the screen.  It wasn't her fault; I shouldn't keep it on the floor.  But, out of this tragedy came the idea for the <strong>TekTuk mini</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>TekTuk mini is born!</strong>  During the next 8 months, the <strong>TekTuk mini</strong> went through the following steps; from sketches, to primitive prototype, to functional prototype, to the final pre-production prototype:</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/500/798/18d206a780a666fe9e519a02dba5837c_large.png?1365443291"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>During this journey, I created the TekTuk for regular sized tablet computers; raised the money for mass production through <a href=""http://igg.me/p/273261/x/1477457"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo</a>; found a trustworthy manufacturer in China; and went to the factory to oversee production and shipping.  </p>
<p>Now that the TekTuk is available to the masses; it is time to take the next step in bedside idevice management with the <strong>TekTuk mini</strong> for mini tablets, cell phones, accessories, and cord management!</p>

Now that the TekTuk is available to the masses; it is time to take the next step in bedside idevice management with the TekTuk mini for mini tablets, cell phones, accessories, and cord management!
 
Vote on the Final Stitching Color!
The above pictures show the TekTuk mini with green and blue stitching (#3 and #6); but we want you to decide what color stitching you want the final product to have!

This is not the first product we have designed and produced. In 2001; we patented and mass produced a storage steel upright cap that was tested in warehouses and proved to save thousands of dollars in damages from product snagging and tearing. Last year; we successfully raised the funds (through Indiegogo) to mass produce, market, and ship the TekTuk - for regular sized tablet computers. Given our past experience in designing and implementing new products, we are confident that will have no problem bringing the TekTuk mini to the eager masses.

<h3>Why Aluminum?</h3>
<p>We decided to use aluminum becouse by far it is the best and cost effective solution to keep very low weight and good strength of parts, all of the external chassis is made with 2 mm thick aluminum, no matter if it is the little model 400x220x460 mm or the biggest one 460x910x750mm case, we're using always the same module design and this will be our policy also for future improvement of this product, as we'd like to be totaly related to quality, we can't start thinking about how to save some money by reducing the thickness or by changing our unique design.</p>

Welcome to our funding page! We have a great idea but we need your help to turn it into a real product. (Patent Pending)
If you're anything like us you most probably found yourself so many times traveling, anywhere outside home, at friend house, at the airport etc without your Iphone cable. How many times you were looking for your cable? How many times you had to run between rooms and take out the cable from the wall? How many times you had to fight over a cable?

Some of our friends carry USB Cable in their bags but there are times when you don't always have your bag with you or don’t hand with bag at all.
After consuming a few hours at the airport digging for my Cable we came up with a solution. Why not attach a Cable to an iPhone case...? Brilliant!
We've spent a considerable amount of time designing, prototyping and testing our ideas to create the best unique product which we've called the CaseCable.
 
The CaseCable USB Unique Cables:
Different cables colors are available: Black, White, pink, Red, purple, grey and Turquoise. We will collect the colors preferences once the project is funded and based on that we will determine the final colors
  
Cables details:
* Flat USB
* 4 MM Wide
* 9.5 in long
** Case made out of Hard plastic
CaseCable is the Only Slim IPhone case with Unique USB Cable attached on the back of the case. The cable will be always with you. The pins on the back arew holding the cable so you will never drop it.
 
 
Where we can use the USB Cables:
1. While driving we can charge our Iphone with the USB Cable.
2. Using our laptop for Data or charging.
3. Using our Desktop for Data or charging.
 
CaseCable Vs. Existing products:
1. The only one with the Cable attached.
2. Always have the option to charge your battery or play with Data where ever you     are.
3. NEVER forget your Cable at Home.
4. Slim Case and Slim Cable built in.
 
Progress:
So we have made the working prototype and finalized the design.
 
 

Now we need your help and support to move on to production.
After the launch which will end after 50 days we plan to start manufacturing on October 2012 and deliver by the end of the year - Yes just for Christmas time.

We will take all possible measures to get the CaseCable completed as soon as possible.  We have already set up an overseas manufacturing partner to fulfill the plastic injection molding process of the CaseCable.  All we are looking for now is your support to see this project through.  If all goes according to plan we hope to follow this general timetable:

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We believe future home entertainment will require higher bandwidth, better audio/video quality, and more elegant design. Therefore, we are on the journey of creating the world's most reliable cable accessories with a better industrial design in mind.</p>
<p>With PS5 and X-Box X launching later this year, the demand for reliably transferring 8K data is increasing, and we are building two types of cables with active optical technology to meet the demand. The cables are 5 meters long, with HDMI or USB Type-C connectors, seamlessly transferring 8K data.</p>

<h3>The Neckset Story</h3>
<p>We recognize the increasing frequency that we use our smart phones. We must hold it if we want to browse the
  internet, watch a movie, have a video call or even for filming.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893995/files/20140930140628-1948.jpg?1412111188"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In light of this increase we spent countless number of hours trying to find a solution to simplify smartphone
  handling. </p>
<p>We set a goal to develop a test holder (console) that is light, flexible and can be easily re-positioned. No other
  existing camera and phone holder has the flexibility and the simplicity as our test console, Neckset. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/917709/files/20141009134430-tablet-white-01.jpg?1412887470"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/><p>You can find several camera arm stabilizers consoles with vests or with hip placement. These are usually heavy,
  expensive and not very flexible. </p>
<p>In light of this, we wanted to create an easier, more flexible, multi-functional device.</p>
<p>It was a big challenge!</p>
<p>During our development phase we tried every conceivable possibility. The inspired came to us when we thought of Bob
  Dylan‘s harmonica holder. It was then we realized that we wanted a comfortable neck strap.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/894007/files/20140930140825-Dyan-hwy-61-sessions630x300.jpg?1412111305"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We added a flexible arm stabilizer to the neck strap that could be adjusted to the necessary distance and can easily be repositioned.
</p>
<p>Our expectation was to have the neck strap equally flexible as the adjustable arm in order to meet the different requirement of each individual person.
</p>
<p>While modeling the strap we realized that the best results were by using an aluminum core with a soft casing. The
  aluminum core permits the neck strap to firmly fastened and at the same time permitting easy adjustment with a
  comfortable wear.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Once again a challenge presented its self when we wanted to connect the Flexiarm to the neck strap.
</p>
<p>The best solution proved to be a strong hub with a fine cast form that our inventers manages to create.
</p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>The next step was straight forward, leading to designing a stabilizing console holder adjustable for all phone sizes.
</p>
<p>Our console plane was first created using a 3D printer.</p>
<p>It has been our primary goal during planning all the way through production to create a device affordable and
  satisfactory for everyone (to satisfy everyone’s needs). </p>
<p>Our design had to meet the highest standard with the strict requirement of being economically affordable.
</p>
<p>One of the greatest virtues of our device is that it has a low cost compared to unique number of functions it
  provides.</p>

</p><p>Main reason is Easy to Use, Easy to Carry, &amp; Low Cost. <br/>
	Most of the device actually just require a function of ON 
	&amp; OFF, or just need a trigger to function, actually not require too much fancy 
	function.</p>
<p>
<b><i>2. Who are your main target group of customer?</i></b></p>
<p>
		Actual answer is Every People.  The product is so simple that 
	from the age of 3 till 100 - to people who still can lift their hand &amp; move 
	their finger.  This product shall be most helpful to the Old, Sick, 
		Disable &amp; Blind people.  They shall just lay back or sit back with 
		their hand carry only a very light weight multifunctional remote 
		control.</p>
<p>
<i><b>3. Why use Infra Red?  Isn't everything is about Smartphone 
	now?</b></i></p>
<p>
	Yes, OneClickON is using IR Infra Red method to do communication.  We did 
	study about the most popular device smartphone with the using of download 
	application.  The study showed the OneClickON method is the fastest method to 
	control a device. <br/>   <b>
	Step#1 - Pick up OneClickON. <br/>    Step#2 - 
	Point to the device want to control <br/>     Step#3 
	- A click on the button</b><br/> Study on others method, still not able to achieve 
	3 steps method.</p>
<p>
	If OneClickON concept kick start well, next step is looking for a quick 
	click button at external for every smartphone to achieve 3 steps function 
	method.</p>
<p>
<i><b>4. Are the devices need always be in 
	Standby Mode?  Standby Mode still consume power.</b></i></p>
<p>
	Yes, devices need to be in standby mode to be ready to receive OneClickON 
	signal. Standby Mode current consumption shows the power is much less 
	compare to operation mode. The circuits also have been further improved such 
	that consume minimum power in standby mode, so that devices can be always in 
	standby 24x7. Still, if not using, the best is to switch off the power 
	supply.</p>
<p>
<b><i>5. Is OneClickON only be able to 
	control device only you can see? how shall I control remotely?</i></b></p>
<p>
	Yes, you only can do remote control for the devices in front of you just 
	like TV remote control.  This devices shall not be able to control 
	devices that is not within your visual distance.  Study shows people 
	most interest on the devices  in front of them. They will want to see 
	to confirm the device has been controlled.  People shall worry if the 
	have to turn on any device that they do not have any visibility.  Plus, 
	people also afraid their remote control devices have been hacked.  </p>

<i><b>6. Is all OneClickON using same code? 
	then other people who got OneClickON shall be able to control my devices?</b></i></p>
<p>
	Yes, if any people else got the OneClickON, they shall be able to control 
	your devices. Same theory, if you have the OneClickON, you also shall be 
	able to control their devices.  OneClickON act like a remote control 
	switch. This means anybody also can turn ON or turn OFF a switch. It also 
	means others can help themselves at your place without fumbling to find the 
	correct switch by try &amp; error.  However, take note that they only 
	can control devices in visible range. This means they can only control your 
	devices at your place.</p>
<p>
<i><b>7. All devices using same code, that 
	means my ""One Click"" may ""ON"" several devices at the same time?</b></i></p>
<p>
	Yes, if a device detect the IR code, it will be trigger.  We have 
	design the IR LED such that the angle range is very narrow at only 10 
	degree. That is about a person average pointing error range. Of cause, do 
	not put OneClickON devices side by side, such that it will be ""accidentally"" 
	trigger. The best is having the bed as the center position of a room. Then, 
	apply 10 degree difference to place OneClickON devices.</p>
<p>
<b><i>8</i></b><i><b>. Is OneClickON remote control only 
	can control devices with Logo OneClickON?</b></i></p>
<p>
	Yes, it is about the Infra Red communication technology.  One device as 
	encoder, another devices install with decoder.  Only when the Code are match 
	then only the devices can be control.  Others Remote Control shall not 
	able to interface. </p>
<p>
<b><i>9</i></b><i><b>. How low cost can you guarantee your OneClickON devices?</b></i></p>
<p>
	Base on the electronics components used, &amp; base on study of other platform 
	devices components, OneClickON circuit is far less complicated, using very 
	less components, not using high end specific functional IC.  When 
	product go for mass production, the cost shall be much lower compare to 
	platform using Bluetooth, internet, Smartphone.</p>
<p>
<b><i>10</i></b><i><b>. What do you mean by ""Your On Bed 
	Solution""?</b></i></p>
<p>
	With using OneClickON, you shall be able to lie on your bed sweet bed. 
	Without opening your eyes, you still can know what time it is, you still can 
	turn on/off fan, you still can turn on/off light, &amp; you still can turn 
	on/off Radio.  Really it is ""Your On Bed Solution"".</p>
<p>
<i><b>11. I will like to control the Light to 
	have dim feature.  I will like to control devices with many function.  
	Can you achieve that with using just one button concept?</b></i></p>
<p>
	Yes, now we have study the multiple stage methods - first click full light, 
	second click half light, third click dim light, fourth click no light.  
	Next, we also like to study if the old function code like <b>
	Morse Code</b> can be used to trigger 
	more function.</p>
<p>
<b><i>12.</i></b><i><b> What is your future Plan?</b></i></p>
<p>
	As shown, this OneClickON application is boundless.  We have the target 
	that every person own one unit. Then, the products shall expand to public 
	device that every person shall be able to benefit.  We are also 
	actively looking for partners that want to integrate this platform into 
	their devices. We are also looking for Smartphone want to install a quick

OneClickON - Receiver PCB Design 
OneClickON - Key Chain
Frequent Ask Question ??? - OneClickON1. Why only one button?
Main reason is Easy to Use, Easy to Carry, & Low Cost. 
	Most of the device actually just require a function of ON 
	& OFF, or just need a trigger to function, actually not require too much fancy 
	function.

2. Who are your main target group of customer?

		Actual answer is Every People.  The product is so simple that 
	from the age of 3 till 100 - to people who still can lift their hand & move 
	their finger.  This product shall be most helpful to the Old, Sick, 
		Disable & Blind people.  They shall just lay back or sit back with 
		their hand carry only a very light weight multifunctional remote 
		control.

3. Why use Infra Red?  Isn't everything is about Smartphone 
	now?

	Yes, OneClickON is using IR Infra Red method to do communication.  We did 
	study about the most popular device smartphone with the using of download 
	application.  The study showed the OneClickON method is the fastest method to 
	control a device.    
	Step#1 - Pick up OneClickON.     Step#2 - 
	Point to the device want to control      Step#3 
	- A click on the button Study on others method, still not able to achieve 
	3 steps method.

	If OneClickON concept kick start well, next step is looking for a quick 
	click button at external for every smartphone to achieve 3 steps function 
	method.

4. Are the devices need always be in 
	Standby Mode?  Standby Mode still consume power.

	Yes, devices need to be in standby mode to be ready to receive OneClickON 
	signal. Standby Mode current consumption shows the power is much less 
	compare to operation mode. The circuits also have been further improved such 
	that consume minimum power in standby mode, so that devices can be always in 
	standby 24x7. Still, if not using, the best is to switch off the power 
	supply.

5. Is OneClickON only be able to 
	control device only you can see? how shall I control remotely?

	Yes, you only can do remote control for the devices in front of you just 
	like TV remote control.  This devices shall not be able to control 
	devices that is not within your visual distance.  Study shows people 
	most interest on the devices  in front of them. They will want to see 
	to confirm the device has been controlled.  People shall worry if the 
	have to turn on any device that they do not have any visibility.  Plus, 
	people also afraid their remote control devices have been hacked.  

6. Is all OneClickON using same code? 
	then other people who got OneClickON shall be able to control my devices?

	Yes, if any people else got the OneClickON, they shall be able to control 
	your devices. Same theory, if you have the OneClickON, you also shall be 
	able to control their devices.  OneClickON act like a remote control 
	switch. This means anybody also can turn ON or turn OFF a switch. It also 
	means others can help themselves at your place without fumbling to find the 
	correct switch by try & error.  However, take note that they only 
	can control devices in visible range. This means they can only control your 
	devices at your place.

7. All devices using same code, that 
	means my ""One Click"" may ""ON"" several devices at the same time?

	Yes, if a device detect the IR code, it will be trigger.  We have 
	design the IR LED such that the angle range is very narrow at only 10 
	degree. That is about a person average pointing error range. Of cause, do 
	not put OneClickON devices side by side, such that it will be ""accidentally"" 
	trigger. The best is having the bed as the center position of a room. Then, 
	apply 10 degree difference to place OneClickON devices.

8. Is OneClickON remote control only 
	can control devices with Logo OneClickON?

	Yes, it is about the Infra Red communication technology.  One device as 
	encoder, another devices install with decoder.  Only when the Code are match 
	then only the devices can be control.  Others Remote Control shall not 
	able to interface. 

9. How low cost can you guarantee your OneClickON devices?

	Base on the electronics components used, & base on study of other platform 
	devices components, OneClickON circuit is far less complicated, using very 
	less components, not using high end specific functional IC.  When 
	product go for mass production, the cost shall be much lower compare to 
	platform using Bluetooth, internet, Smartphone.

10. What do you mean by ""Your On Bed 
	Solution""?

	With using OneClickON, you shall be able to lie on your bed sweet bed. 
	Without opening your eyes, you still can know what time it is, you still can 
	turn on/off fan, you still can turn on/off light, & you still can turn 
	on/off Radio.  Really it is ""Your On Bed Solution"".

11. I will like to control the Light to 
	have dim feature.  I will like to control devices with many function.  
	Can you achieve that with using just one button concept?

	Yes, now we have study the multiple stage methods - first click full light, 
	second click half light, third click dim light, fourth click no light.  
	Next, we also like to study if the old function code like 
	Morse Code can be used to trigger 
	more function.

12. What is your future Plan?

	As shown, this OneClickON application is boundless.  We have the target 
	that every person own one unit. Then, the products shall expand to public 
	device that every person shall be able to benefit.  We are also 
	actively looking for partners that want to integrate this platform into 
	their devices. We are also looking for Smartphone want to install a quick 
	click button for OneClickON.How Your Money will be Used?

</ul><p>This beautifully crafted smartphone is a proving ground for the most advanced mobile technologies on the horizon, a showpiece for true mobile innovation. And at the heart of it all is convergence: connect to any monitor and this Ubuntu phone transforms into an Ubuntu PC, with a fully integrated desktop OS and shared access to all files.</p>
<p>We’re fascinated by converged computing, the idea that the smartphone in your pocket can also be the brain of the PC on your desk. We’ve shaped Ubuntu so you can transition seamlessly between the two environments. Now all that’s needed is a phone that’s designed from the ground up to be a PC as well.</p>
<p>The Ubuntu Edge is our very own superphone, a catalyst to drive the next generation of personal computing.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/graphics/hr-01.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;""/><img alt=""The hardware"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/graphics/headers-02.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p>We’ve scoured the research labs of the biggest companies and most exciting startups for the latest and greatest mobile technologies to specify the first-generation Edge.</p>
<p>Crafted from cool, textured amorphous metal, the Edge has a distinctive, precise look but its rakishly chamfered edges are shaped to fit naturally in the palm -- our design prototype already has a wonderfully solid feel. It’s the right size, too. Edge gestures are the next big thing in mobile, and our testing has found that a 4.5in screen is ideal for comfortable control of all four edges with one hand.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/dark/edge-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 10px;""/><p>We also believe the race for ever higher resolution has become a distraction. Beyond 300ppi you’re adding overhead rather than improving display clarity. We think colour, brightness and dynamic range are now the edge of invention so we’ll choose a display for its balance of resolution, dynamic range and colour accuracy.</p>
<p>We’ll protect that gorgeous display with something vastly tougher than glass: pure sapphire crystal, a material so hard only diamond could scratch it. For a phone to run a full desktop OS, it must have the raw power of a PC. We’ll choose the fastest available multi-core processor, at least 4GB of RAM and a massive 128GB of storage. The battery will use silicon-anode technology, so we can squeeze more energy into the same dimensions.</p>

<p>With that kind of muscle, this phone can be your main PC anywhere -- and we really do mean anywhere. You can use the desktop wherever you can find a standard HDMI screen, and the dual-LTE chip will get you online with 4G even when you’re travelling abroad. It’s desktop computing gone truly mobile.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/graphics/hr-01.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;""/><img alt=""The software"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/graphics/headers-03.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p>Next-generation hardware deserves innovative software. The Ubuntu Edge will dual-boot both the Ubuntu phone OS and Android, and convert into a fully integrated Ubuntu desktop PC.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/ui/ui-3.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 10px;""/><p>First, Ubuntu mobile. We designed the interface to create a beautiful home screen that’s free from the usual clutter. You navigate by swiping over an edge of the screen: open your favourite apps on the left edge, switch instantly between open apps from the right, and use the system and app toolbars at the top and bottom respectively. It’s so simple, Ubuntu doesn’t need a home button at all.</p>
<p>Specialist data artists have designed Ubuntu’s welcome screen, with graphics that evolve over time to reflect your use of the phone. We’ve reinvented the inbox so you can read and respond to texts, emails and social media posts in an instant.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/518/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/ui/ui-4.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 10px;""/><p>From mobile... to desktop. Yes, it’s the full Ubuntu desktop OS used by millions on a daily basis -- and it runs directly from the phone, so you’ll be able to move seamlessly from one environment to the other with no file syncing or transfers required. The core OS and applications are fully integrated with their smartphone equivalents, so you can even make and receive calls from the desktop while you work.</p>
<p>Finally, you can also boot the phone into Android. And there’s a good reason for that...</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/graphics/hr-01.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;""/><img alt=""The rollout plan"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/graphics/headers-04.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p>As well as being a bonus for app developers and anyone with a big Android app collection, including Android on the phone means we’re able to offer full convergence at launch. On day one, you’ll be able to launch the Ubuntu desktop from within Android using our existing Ubuntu for Android app. That integration is fully functional today, as you can see from this video.</p>
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNhlVn3ETQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://assets.ubuntu.com/sites/ubuntu/515/u/img/campaigns/22072013_gogo/graphics/video-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 10px;""/></a>
<p>Then shortly after launch we’ll push out a free software update that adds this desktop integration to Ubuntu mobile as well. That’s the real goal we’re working towards. At that point you’ll have a leading-edge smartphone that runs Ubuntu and Android, both of which can also run a fully integrated Ubuntu desktop OS. What other phone can match that?</p>
<p>However you choose to use Ubuntu Edge, the incredible components will keep it running fast and fresh as our software evolves. We’ll push out monthly Ubuntu software updates to add features and polish, and we guarantee to keep supporting the phone for three years.</p>

<p>A lot of people around the world have collaborated to get us this far.

“If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room. Say hello to the Ubuntu Edge, the first smartphone to use open-source Ubuntu Touch software as well as Android”
– CNET


“By this time next year, there could very well be one very elegant looking, monstrously powerful smartphone that can actually become a computer”
– Silicon Angle


“In case you haven’t been following the story, the Edge is an awfully handsome concept for a phone that will run Ubuntu and Android”
– TechCrunch


“Apparently the Ubuntu community is nuts about this idea. Within just under eight hours... some $2 million in donations to the project have flooded in, making it what's said to be the fastest and thus perhaps most successful crowdfunding effort ever seen”
– Fast Company
















In the car industry, Formula 1 provides a commercial testbed for cutting-edge technologies. The Ubuntu Edge project aims to do the same for the mobile phone industry -- to provide a low-volume, high-technology platform, crowdfunded by enthusiasts and mobile computing professionals. A pioneering project that accelerates the adoption of new technologies and drives them down into the mainstream.





This beautifully crafted smartphone is a proving ground for the most advanced mobile technologies on the horizon, a showpiece for true mobile innovation. And at the heart of it all is convergence: connect to any monitor and this Ubuntu phone transforms into an Ubuntu PC, with a fully integrated desktop OS and shared access to all files.
We’re fascinated by converged computing, the idea that the smartphone in your pocket can also be the brain of the PC on your desk. We’ve shaped Ubuntu so you can transition seamlessly between the two environments. Now all that’s needed is a phone that’s designed from the ground up to be a PC as well.
The Ubuntu Edge is our very own superphone, a catalyst to drive the next generation of personal computing.
We’ve scoured the research labs of the biggest companies and most exciting startups for the latest and greatest mobile technologies to specify the first-generation Edge.
Crafted from cool, textured amorphous metal, the Edge has a distinctive, precise look but its rakishly chamfered edges are shaped to fit naturally in the palm -- our design prototype already has a wonderfully solid feel. It’s the right size, too. Edge gestures are the next big thing in mobile, and our testing has found that a 4.5in screen is ideal for comfortable control of all four edges with one hand.
We also believe the race for ever higher resolution has become a distraction. Beyond 300ppi you’re adding overhead rather than improving display clarity. We think colour, brightness and dynamic range are now the edge of invention so we’ll choose a display for its balance of resolution, dynamic range and colour accuracy.
We’ll protect that gorgeous display with something vastly tougher than glass: pure sapphire crystal, a material so hard only diamond could scratch it. For a phone to run a full desktop OS, it must have the raw power of a PC. We’ll choose the fastest available multi-core processor, at least 4GB of RAM and a massive 128GB of storage. The battery will use silicon-anode technology, so we can squeeze more energy into the same dimensions.

With that kind of muscle, this phone can be your main PC anywhere -- and we really do mean anywhere. You can use the desktop wherever you can find a standard HDMI screen, and the dual-LTE chip will get you online with 4G even when you’re travelling abroad. It’s desktop computing gone truly mobile.
Next-generation hardware deserves innovative software. The Ubuntu Edge will dual-boot both the Ubuntu phone OS and Android, and convert into a fully integrated Ubuntu desktop PC.
First, Ubuntu mobile. We designed the interface to create a beautiful home screen that’s free from the usual clutter. You navigate by swiping over an edge of the screen: open your favourite apps on the left edge, switch instantly between open apps from the right, and use the system and app toolbars at the top and bottom respectively. It’s so simple, Ubuntu doesn’t need a home button at all.
Specialist data artists have designed Ubuntu’s welcome screen, with graphics that evolve over time to reflect your use of the phone. We’ve reinvented the inbox so you can read and respond to texts, emails and social media posts in an instant.
From mobile... to desktop. Yes, it’s the full Ubuntu desktop OS used by millions on a daily basis -- and it runs directly from the phone, so you’ll be able to move seamlessly from one environment to the other with no file syncing or transfers required. The core OS and applications are fully integrated with their smartphone equivalents, so you can even make and receive calls from the desktop while you work.
Finally, you can also boot the phone into Android. And there’s a good reason for that...
As well as being a bonus for app developers and anyone with a big Android app collection, including Android on the phone means we’re able to offer full convergence at launch. On day one, you’ll be able to launch the Ubuntu desktop from within Android using our existing Ubuntu for Android app. That integration is fully functional today, as you can see from this video.

Then shortly after launch we’ll push out a free software update that adds this desktop integration to Ubuntu mobile as well. That’s the real goal we’re working towards. At that point you’ll have a leading-edge smartphone that runs Ubuntu and Android, both of which can also run a fully integrated Ubuntu desktop OS. What other phone can match that?
However you choose to use Ubuntu Edge, the incredible components will keep it running fast and fresh as our software evolves. We’ll push out monthly Ubuntu software updates to add features and polish, and we guarantee to keep supporting the phone for three years.
HTML5 apps written for other platforms can be brought over to Ubuntu with ease, and any web property can quickly be adapted to run as a web app, with its own icon and access to system services. For richer applications, use our QML toolkit for amazingly productive high-performance engineering.
But best of all, using the Ubuntu SDK you can write and upload a single native application that has desktop, tablet and phone interfaces. It’s a developer’s dream.

<p><b>Arduissimo</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Arduissimo is a MultiCore Arduino
Project. It is based on the Low Cost FPGA Arduino Board – called
“<b>Morpheus I</b>”, which is the central element of this
project:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1109011/files/20141220121538-morpheusI_162.JPG?1419106538"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The following picture gives an overview
of how to use it:<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1109017/files/20141220121927-flow.jpg?1419106767"" src="""" style=""""/></p>An Arduino board usually has a chip
with one processor, program and data memory and a set of peripherals.
You can program it using the Arduino IDE or other IDEs like the Atmel
Studio and you can use the Arduino language or other languages like
C++. You download the program through the USB interface for example.
<p>
</p><p>This is also true for this project. You
can use the enhanced Arduino IDE called the Arduissimo IDE or
alternatives like the Atmel Studio and languages like the  Arduino
language or C++ as well. The difference is, that you now have 16
processors available and more program and data memory to run your
code. The system has a maximum system performance of 166MHz, which
means that when you use 5 processors, that each one of them is
running at 33.2MHz. The system boots from the SD-card when applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Arduino DUE is based on an ARM
Cortex M3 CPU (“CM3”). This project is also based on a Cortex M3
compatible CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the performance increase and the
multicore solution are not the only new aspects here. The cool thing
is, that the system is optimized to execute virtual peripherals.
Virtual peripherals provide the functionality of common peripherals
like PWMs, serial interfaces etc., but they only exists as software
code. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>IDE</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1109021/files/20141220122151-ide_compile.jpg?1419106911"" src="""" style=""""/></p>If you want to use the Arduino IDE –
instead of Atmel Studio – then, don't worry. You can assign
individual loops to individual processors or leave the multicore
handling to the compiler. It is as simple as using the original
Arduino IDE.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1109023/files/20141220122307-ide_mc.jpg?1419106987"" src="""" style=""""/></p>An additional frame lets you setup the
project directory and structure. You can also define a set of sketch
files for your project.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Virtual Peripherals</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Virtual Peripherals replace fixed
hardware peripherals with their functional counterparts in software
using software code and standard GPIOs (General Purpose Inputs and
Outputs). The concept of Virtual Peripherals is best explained with
an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1109026/files/20141220122428-virtual_peripherals_serial.jpg?1419107068"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The picture shows how signals of a
simple serial interface (cs (chip select), clk, data) change over
time to transmit data. It becomes clear, that most of the time, the
signals remain constant. Only at specific time-points they alternate
their value. This is indicated with the little vertical arrows at the
timeline arrow. These actions can be handled by a little software
threads that modify the right signals at the right GPIOs at the right
time.
<p>
</p><p>This method can become very timing
critical, when you need multiple (many) peripherals, but you only
have one processor for it (and all the rest). This is where the
MultiCore solution of this project is perfect. I has many processors
available which quickly execute a thread when needed and then fall
into waiting mode again. There is no fixed relation between a series
of threads for one virtual peripheral and one processor. Threads are
executed on any of the available processors at a given time-point.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1109027/files/20141220122604-vp_4.jpg?1419107164"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The Arduissimo project fully supports
Virtual Peripherals. The Arduissimo board has 99 General Purpose
IOs. This allows you to use an almost unlimited number of PWMs, I2C,
SPI etc. You can still use the standard Arduino Peripherals (for code
compatibility for instance) and you can also use common predefined
Virtual Peripherals as easy as writing Arduino code in the Arduissimo
IDE. It is also possible to modify existing Virtual Peripherals or
define new Virtual Peripherals. You can also use a more professional
IDE like the Atmel Studio and other languages like C++ for it, as
shown in the next picture.
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this MultiCore project optimized
for the embedded world, enabling Virtual Peripherals and using
standard languages and programming flows is one way how the future
might look like. So be one of the very first ones to support it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>RISC-V Version
(NEW)</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The project supports the recently
announced RISC-V processor. A 16-core version is running on the
Morpheus I board at 166MHz (3-stage) and can be used for your project
using the RISC-V compiler flow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[<a href=""riscv.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">riscv.org</a>:] “RISC-V (pronounced
""risk-five"") is a new instruction set architecture (ISA)
that was originally designed to support computer architecture
research and education, which we now hope will become a standard open
architecture for industry implementations. RISC-V was originally
developed in the Computer Science Division of the EECS Department at
the University of California, Berkeley.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Processing for
FPGAs (NEW)</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>[wikipedia:] “<b>Processing</b> is an
open source programming language and integrated development
environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and
visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the
fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to
serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Arduino folks adapted processing
for the Arduino IDE. This project now enhanced this IDE by
incorporating the FPGA compile flow. This allows you to define any
peripheral of your choice and to use it on the Morpheus I board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1109031/files/20141220122831-processing.jpg?1419107311"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The FPGA compile flow is incremental,
which means that the design only changes when the peripherals are
modified. The implementation is based on a single Cortex M3
compatible CPU design.

any of the serial interfaces for instances. Still there are plenty of
IOs available on the Morpheus I and of the Arduino Due.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Motivation</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The motivation for this project is the
realization of an idea I had as a student. This idea multiplies the
functionality of a design – like the one of a Multi-Processor for
example – BUT on a very much reduced area. I was certainly not the
only one having this idea, but I had a lot of fun to continue working
on this technique and I think it can be very useful in today's
embedded world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I call this further developed
technique System Hyper Pipelining (SHP). This project is all about 
SHP, and instead of defining yet another evaluation board and
compiler flow etc., I made everything Arduino compatible and created
an Arduino board with an FPGA on it. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I programmed the FPGA that it provides
now 16 Arduino processors - here Cortex M3 compatible processors - using SHP technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I think that it is really cool
to run more than one processor on a very small device, and I'm very
proud to demonstrate it, I thought I needed something even more
useful to convince you guys. So I developed the concept of virtual
peripherals on top of it. Almost all “embedded” programmer
emulated any kind of interface already on a CPU and the concept of
virtual peripherals is certainly not new, but when you combine it
with System Hyper Pipelining, it can be very efficient. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this project is all about some ideas
and about the right mix of various technologies. With this project I
want do demonstrate, that you can have a very efficient SHP-based
MultiCore solution already on an FPGA and that you as an user can
really benefit from it. So once the system is field proven then we
can think about making an ASIC out of it. Then it will be even faster
and more cost efficient.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><b>Why Crowdfunding ?</b></p>

<p>
</p><p><b>Clarification</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>An
FPGA is used, but no synthesis is needed for Arduissimo: For the
Arduissimo solution a “frozen” design is used, means that it is
not changed by the Arduissimo user and it will only be changed when a
bug is found. Still the nerdy Arduissimo user can add customer
designs of use the FPGA entirely for a new design. Only then
synthesis is needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Virtual
Peripherals: It is not true that one processor executes one
peripheral, so that the numbers of virtual peripherals are limited.
The algorithm of a Virtual Peripheral is sliced into individual
threads.  A thread is then executed on the next available processor.
A Virtual Peripheral does not occupy processor resources when nothing
needs to be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Limitation</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
Virtual Peripherals do not support high speed peripherals like
Gigabit Ethernet etc. It is fast enough to drive servos, motors,
I2Cs, SPIs and related protocols below the range of 10MHz. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Risk</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Morpheus I board did go through
several versions throughout the last years. The board will go through
further testing throughout the crowdfunding phase. The crowdfunding
goal and schedule covers 1 prototype and testing phases. I would
consider the risk that the boards don't work as low.</p>
<p>The electronic parts of the Morpheus I
are very common standard parts. I don't think that any of these will
be discontinued by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Arduissimo FPGA design and the

<p></p></div>","Arduissimo

Arduissimo is a MultiCore Arduino
Project. It is based on the Low Cost FPGA Arduino Board – called
“Morpheus I”, which is the central element of this
project:







The following picture gives an overview
of how to use it:An Arduino board usually has a chip
with one processor, program and data memory and a set of peripherals.
You can program it using the Arduino IDE or other IDEs like the Atmel
Studio and you can use the Arduino language or other languages like
C++. You download the program through the USB interface for example.

This is also true for this project. You
can use the enhanced Arduino IDE called the Arduissimo IDE or
alternatives like the Atmel Studio and languages like the  Arduino
language or C++ as well. The difference is, that you now have 16
processors available and more program and data memory to run your
code. The system has a maximum system performance of 166MHz, which
means that when you use 5 processors, that each one of them is
running at 33.2MHz. The system boots from the SD-card when applied.

The Arduino DUE is based on an ARM
Cortex M3 CPU (“CM3”). This project is also based on a Cortex M3
compatible CPU.

But the performance increase and the
multicore solution are not the only new aspects here. The cool thing
is, that the system is optimized to execute virtual peripherals.
Virtual peripherals provide the functionality of common peripherals
like PWMs, serial interfaces etc., but they only exists as software
code. 


IDE



If you want to use the Arduino IDE –
instead of Atmel Studio – then, don't worry. You can assign
individual loops to individual processors or leave the multicore
handling to the compiler. It is as simple as using the original
Arduino IDE.




An additional frame lets you setup the
project directory and structure. You can also define a set of sketch
files for your project.



Virtual Peripherals

Virtual Peripherals replace fixed
hardware peripherals with their functional counterparts in software
using software code and standard GPIOs (General Purpose Inputs and
Outputs). The concept of Virtual Peripherals is best explained with
an example:

The picture shows how signals of a
simple serial interface (cs (chip select), clk, data) change over
time to transmit data. It becomes clear, that most of the time, the
signals remain constant. Only at specific time-points they alternate
their value. This is indicated with the little vertical arrows at the
timeline arrow. These actions can be handled by a little software
threads that modify the right signals at the right GPIOs at the right
time.

This method can become very timing
critical, when you need multiple (many) peripherals, but you only
have one processor for it (and all the rest). This is where the
MultiCore solution of this project is perfect. I has many processors
available which quickly execute a thread when needed and then fall
into waiting mode again. There is no fixed relation between a series
of threads for one virtual peripheral and one processor. Threads are
executed on any of the available processors at a given time-point.

The Arduissimo project fully supports
Virtual Peripherals. The Arduissimo board has 99 General Purpose
IOs. This allows you to use an almost unlimited number of PWMs, I2C,
SPI etc. You can still use the standard Arduino Peripherals (for code
compatibility for instance) and you can also use common predefined
Virtual Peripherals as easy as writing Arduino code in the Arduissimo
IDE. It is also possible to modify existing Virtual Peripherals or
define new Virtual Peripherals. You can also use a more professional
IDE like the Atmel Studio and other languages like C++ for it, as
shown in the next picture.

Maybe this MultiCore project optimized
for the embedded world, enabling Virtual Peripherals and using
standard languages and programming flows is one way how the future
might look like. So be one of the very first ones to support it.

RISC-V Version
(NEW)

The project supports the recently
announced RISC-V processor. A 16-core version is running on the
Morpheus I board at 166MHz (3-stage) and can be used for your project
using the RISC-V compiler flow.

[riscv.org:] “RISC-V (pronounced
""risk-five"") is a new instruction set architecture (ISA)
that was originally designed to support computer architecture
research and education, which we now hope will become a standard open
architecture for industry implementations. RISC-V was originally
developed in the Computer Science Division of the EECS Department at
the University of California, Berkeley.”


Processing for
FPGAs (NEW)

[wikipedia:] “Processing is an
open source programming language and integrated development
environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and
visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the
fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to
serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks.”

The Arduino folks adapted processing
for the Arduino IDE. This project now enhanced this IDE by
incorporating the FPGA compile flow. This allows you to define any
peripheral of your choice and to use it on the Morpheus I board.



The FPGA compile flow is incremental,
which means that the design only changes when the peripherals are
modified. The implementation is based on a single Cortex M3
compatible CPU design.

Emulator and
Virtual Prototyping

The Arduissimo project provides an
emulator. An overview of the GUI gives the next picture.


With this emulator you can debug your
Arduissimo code. It lets you set breakpoints and lets you step
through the code. You can check out special function register values
and display port waveforms. Also a stimulie pattern can be defined.

The emulator is open source java code,
so anybody can modify and improve ;-) it. 


Sometimes emulators are limited. This
is why this project supports the idea of virtual prototyping. The
emulator is based on a cycle accurate C model which is automatically
derived from the MultiCore Arduissimo design. This cycle accurate C
model can now be embedded in your simulation model of your robot or
environment model. A demo project shows you how.

uPlug
(an outlook)

You
might have wondered what these extra headers and screws are for. They
are part of a Plug and Play system called uPlug, which is outside the
scope of this campaign, but maybe subject of the next one.




You can plug in various modules. This
picture shows an example you could use in your next drone project. It
has a video in, Xbee,
a temperature and humidity sensor, a navigation switch, drivers for
servos and motors, a GPS module, a Wifi module, LEDs and keys, an SD
Card holder for your flight data for instance and a 3-axis
accelerometer and a 3-axis gyro.






With
this example you can control your little robotic car. It has a
bluetooth module, USB master interface to control other devices, a
DAC, control modules for a stepper motors, DC motors and servos. It
also shows loudspeaker, display, PMOD, Poti, LEDs and Key modules.
And everything on top of an Raspberry Pi.


With
the new High Speed IO channels and a few new uPlug modules, the
Morpheus I board can be used for video processing. The interfaces
allow conversion to/from HDMI, DVI, DSI, Raspberry Pi Cam, PAL, VGA,
...


The Morpheus I for FPGA nerds

Evaluation Board:

The Morpheus I board can
also be used as a nice FPGA evaluation board. The user can download
his own FPGA configuration file through the USB interface. With an
additional adapter board, the JTAG pins can also be accessed when a
Xilinx
download cable should be used. 



Logic Analyzer:

The 48MB 166MHz 32-bit SDRAM
memory and 8MB 166MHz 16-bit SDRAM memory combined with the HS-USB
interface make this board ideal to be used as a logic analyzer. 



OpenCores Remap:

All uPlug boards can be used with it
and some SoCs from opencores – like the MSP430, ARMs or the
OpenRisc1200 - are remapped on this board and will be released as
open source.


System Configurator:

The System Configurator helps you to
download any bitfile to the Morpheus I. It also lets you define you
SoC to be mapped on the Morpheus I. This also includes customer
peripherals. It does the complete compiling and tool handling for
you. Since there is still space available in the MultiCore Arduino
design, it allows you to add customer logic to the Arduissimo
project.


Last but not least, an FPGA nerd can
also combine the Morpheus I with a standard Arduino and associated
modules. This picture shows a possible video frame grabber. The video
input stream is decoded into digital signals using a uPlug module,
the FPGA handles the video bitstream and might use the memories for
data storage. The communication to the Arduino Due can be based on
any of the serial interfaces for instances. Still there are plenty of
IOs available on the Morpheus I and of the Arduino Due.

Clarification

An
FPGA is used, but no synthesis is needed for Arduissimo: For the
Arduissimo solution a “frozen” design is used, means that it is
not changed by the Arduissimo user and it will only be changed when a
bug is found. Still the nerdy Arduissimo user can add customer
designs of use the FPGA entirely for a new design. Only then
synthesis is needed.

Virtual
Peripherals: It is not true that one processor executes one
peripheral, so that the numbers of virtual peripherals are limited.
The algorithm of a Virtual Peripheral is sliced into individual
threads.  A thread is then executed on the next available processor.
A Virtual Peripheral does not occupy processor resources when nothing
needs to be done.


Limitation

The
Virtual Peripherals do not support high speed peripherals like
Gigabit Ethernet etc. It is fast enough to drive servos, motors,
I2Cs, SPIs and related protocols below the range of 10MHz. 



Risk

The Morpheus I board did go through
several versions throughout the last years. The board will go through
further testing throughout the crowdfunding phase. The crowdfunding
goal and schedule covers 1 prototype and testing phases. I would
consider the risk that the boards don't work as low.
The electronic parts of the Morpheus I
are very common standard parts. I don't think that any of these will
be discontinued by the manufacturer.

The Arduissimo FPGA design and the
Arduissimo IDE work. Bugs can be cleared by modifying the source
code. 




Thank You

crowdfunding campaign. If you think that MultiCore Programing and
Virtual Peripherals can be a lot of fun, then please become a

<p>Volt Buckle came to fruition after realizing that men typically have only their pockets to carry mobile device chargers and all the associated wires that come along with them. After trying to match numerous existing chargers to buckles, a match was finally found. After some genuine old-fashioned blood, sweat and tears,and hours pounding metal in the garage, the original prototype Volt Buckle was born.</p>

<p>Building off of this working proof of concept, the CaliBuilt Team went to the experts. Some of the best and brightest electrical, mechanical, and3D design engineers in California's Bay Area came together to custom design the charger and buckle using the latest and most advanced tools. The result is the alpha-prototype that we are presenting to you here on Indiegogo! The Volt Buckle chargers that you see here on our Indiegogo site (thanks for giving us a look!) were 3D printed, which leads us to the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Volt Buckle - Where are we in the Process? </strong></p>

<p>We feel that the vast majority of the engineering is complete. Upon achieving funding, we plan to loosen up some of the tolerances on the buckle for easier machining, and we have already improved the connection method of the charger to the buckle to ensure long term, high-quality performance and will incorporate that into the production run of Volt Buckle. Minor stuff. So far, we have been able to keep the vast majority of design, product sourcing, and manufacturing here in the United States, and we intend to continue that with your funding.</p>
<p>The funding that we seek here with the help of the Indiegogo community will fund the final minor engineering, and most importantly, will allow us to obtain the molds to produce the charger case, and part for the Volt Sync Connector. Your charger will be made of custom molded ABS and will have a sleek, stylish appearance.</p>
<p>The beauty of Volt Buckle from a manufacturing standpoint is that all parts are easy to source and obtain. We have sourced belt manufacturers, and have several machine shops ready to produce the buckles. The electronics themselves are already being manufactured. And that's pretty much it! You can back Volt Buckle with confidence knowing that you will get a high quality product that should serve you for years.</p>
<p>Your support will also, of course, pay for the parts and labor to create the Volt Buckles ordered by the Indiegogo community, and hopefully a few more for an initial inventory to roll-out the product to the general public.</p>

<p><strong>Volt Buckle - FAQ</strong></p>
<p>Q: What size belt do I order if I am waist size X?</p>
<p>A: The belt that comes with your Volt Buckle is custom designed, and we have endeavored to accommodate the widest range of waist sizes as possible. Unfortunately, we may not be able to fit all waists until later in development. Our initial production run will accommodate waist sizes from 30 inches to 42 inches, and we will contact you directly after the project is funded to obtain your sizing and color information, in addition to which sync connector you would like (USB to mini USB, USB to micro USB, USB to Apple 40 pin, or USB to the rumored new iPhone connector.)</p>
<p>Q: Will my pants stay up if I'm using the Volt Buckle?</p>
<p>A: Yes! We have specially designed the Patent Pending belt that comes with your Volt Buckle to securely latch so your pants stay up when Volt Buckle is providing you the power that you need.</p>
<p>Q: Is Volt Buckle 220V compatible?</p>
<p>A: No. Volt Buckle currently provides 2 amps at 110 volts, which means Volt Buckle works out of the box in North America, e.g. the United States, Canada and Mexico. Depending on the level of funding achieved, Volt Buckle may look to go international very quickly!</p>
<p>Q: What color belt/buckle combinations do you have available?</p>
<p>A: We have a color combination that is sure to match any clothes that you are wearing. The combinations that we are currently offering are:</p>

<p>Q: Is there a women's version?</p>
<p>A: At this time, there is no specific women's version; however, the belt goes well in casual situations and fits well with jeans, so there is nothing preventing women from wearing the belt. We have some ideas in development specifically for women! Help fund the development of a women's version by donating to Volt Buckle version 1.0.</p>
<p>Q: My mobile device's charger input is on the side. Will Volt Buckle still work for me?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Volt Buckle will charge your device; however, for best performance when docked, we recommend that the charger input be either on the top or the bottom of the device. With your funding we are devising a solution so that all mobile devices will be able to be docked when charging.</p>
<p>Q: What about the rumored new iPhone 5 connector?</p>
<p>A: We are well aware of the rumors regarding Apple's new iPhone connector. Once the new specifications are obtained from Apple, we will send you a new connector at our cost, plus shipping.</p>
<p>*Volt Buckle will charge any Apple, or USB connective device. It may not properly dock large items such as the iPad.</p>

A: Yes. Volt Buckle will charge your device; however, for best performance when docked, we recommend that the charger input be either on the top or the bottom of the device. With your funding we are devising a solution so that all mobile devices will be able to be docked when charging.
Q: What about the rumored new iPhone 5 connector?
A: We are well aware of the rumors regarding Apple's new iPhone connector. Once the new specifications are obtained from Apple, we will send you a new connector at our cost, plus shipping.
*Volt Buckle will charge any Apple, or USB connective device. It may not properly dock large items such as the iPad.

FOR PLEDGE OR ORDER AMOUNTS LARGER THAN LISTED, PLEASE CONTACT US! 
THANK YOU TO THE INDIEGOGO COMMUNITY!
The CaliBuilt team sincerely appreciates you taking the time to check out our project. We hope the Indiegogo community is as excited about Volt Buckle as we are. Any amount you can contribute brings us that much closer to making our dream a reality, and we are truly grateful for all contributions to our project. We strive to be responsive to comments and feedback to the greatest extent possible.",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>The Stauffer Innovations team is turning to Indiegogo to help us take this innovative new product into full production. We have a proven working prototype--you've just seen it in action. Now all we need to do is generate enough pre-orders to help cover the cost of production molds. Then it will be time to produce the inaugural run of Bud Buttons!</p>
</div>
<p>The Bud Button's design is unlike anything you've ever seen. There are a few other magnetic clips out on the market...but they all fall short when it comes to convenience, security, and flexibility. Bud Buttons is, as they say, the better mouse trap. As a backer of our project, you will have front row seat to this exciting manufacturing stage. We will be posting regular updates and pictures on our Facebook page (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/staufferinnovationsllc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/staufferinnovationsllc</a>), as well as here on our Indiegogo page.</p>
<p><strong>Convenience.</strong> The key design feature unique to Bud Buttons is its removable ""tether"" component--the piece that connects the magnetic clip and backer disk together. Having two separate pieces is the greatest advantage to a magnetic clip design...but it can also become its Achilles heel. Two separate pieces means that you can locate the clip anywhere on your clothing. Place one piece on the inside, one on the outside, and you're good to go. But having two separate pieces also means that you could accidentally drop or lose one of them. That's where Bud Buttons provides the answer. Its design combines the flexibility of a two piece clip design with the convenience of a removable tether. Doing something casual? Keep everything connected and just snap Bud Buttons over the edge of your clothing. Need a clip location in the middle of your clothing? Remove the tether and position Bud Buttons wherever you wish.</p>

<p><strong>Security.</strong> Bud Buttons utilize the power of neodymium magnets to securely latch onto your clothing, no matter how slippery or tight it might be. The Bud Button's clip was designed to securely attach to your cord, by using a ""one way"" style center opening. You won't need to worry about the cord freeing itself while you're moving around. By angling the clip tabs in/down, the design ensures that the cord won't come back out through the opening. When you do want to remove the cord, simply loop it back on itself, snap it down through the clip opening a second time, and pull the cord out the side. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/235/608/c878ac302f930a76138624598494c484_large.jpg?1351623585"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Flexibility.</strong> The Bud Button's design permits a wide range of uses and applications by including three separate cord openings--the primary center opening, plus two side openings. The center opening is large enough to accommodate a wide range of cord styles...but small enough to keep the splitter (where the cord splits from one strand into two strands) on most style of ear buds from passing through it. This creates a comfortable slack to your ears when a Bud Button is located at the base of your neck. The two side openings on the Bud Button's clip allow the user to loop the cord to take up unwanted slack, or wind the cord around, reducing its length and locking the clip's position on the cord.</p>

<p><strong>Convenience. Security. Flexibility.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plan.</strong> With a successful campaign here on Indiegogo, we will be able to make final engineering tweaks to the Bud Buttons prototype, have production molds made, and manufacture the inaugural run of Bud Buttons. In order to keep our expenses as low as possible, the production molds will be built in China...but the Bud Buttons product itself will be manufactured in a facility just a few miles from my house. I am very fortunate to have such a wonderful team of business associates, engineers, business mentors, and friends partnering with me on this project. Together with your support we will bring Bud Buttons to the masses!</p>

<p>To start, we thank you all for stopping by and checking out our Indiegogo page.</p>
<p>We have spent countless days and nights engineering this amazing Wireless Bluetooth Bamboo Keyboard. A rewarding, albeit difficult process, from designing the products by hand, to creating CAD drawings, to prototyping the design via plastic, to altering prototypes in various materials, to a finished product consisted of beautiful wood. And now, today, we achieved our project’s primary objective -- provide you with the highest quality wood keyboard on the market at an affordable price!</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/594/146/42cdded8c1fb50ab550316597246bcc8_large.JPG?1368657542"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p>There are a few wood keyboards on the market today, and we know that. However, the issue is that some are made of replica wood, are way over-priced, and to be candid; the quality is pathetic. When it comes to our keyboards though, we are happy to say we did not have to sacrifice quality and functionality for style and brand inflation. We believe we have come up with a game-changer in the world keyboards!</p>

<p>Before we get into the details I want to share with you a bit about myself and the team that helped make this all possible. My name is Chase and I am the founder and creator of The Woodshop at age 17. My brother Chris, who is 19, is majoring in product/industrial design. We have taught and learned from each other (with some help from the his college courses of course) how to work various CAD programs which has enabled us to design the best wooden keyboard in the world. Not to mention we are not rookies in the world of design and business. We owned and operated a clothing company that sold products in all 50 states and over 20 countries globally. Everything we have done could not have been accomplished without the help and support of our parents.</p>

<p>Hopefully you can tell we have spent loads of time to make sure that everything will run smoothly after the project has ended (if our project is successful of course). Once again thanks for stopping by our page and spread the word!!!</p>
</div></div>","To start, we thank you all for stopping by and checking out our Indiegogo page.
We have spent countless days and nights engineering this amazing Wireless Bluetooth Bamboo Keyboard. A rewarding, albeit difficult process, from designing the products by hand, to creating CAD drawings, to prototyping the design via plastic, to altering prototypes in various materials, to a finished product consisted of beautiful wood. And now, today, we achieved our project’s primary objective -- provide you with the highest quality wood keyboard on the market at an affordable price!


There are a few wood keyboards on the market today, and we know that. However, the issue is that some are made of replica wood, are way over-priced, and to be candid; the quality is pathetic. When it comes to our keyboards though, we are happy to say we did not have to sacrifice quality and functionality for style and brand inflation. We believe we have come up with a game-changer in the world keyboards!

Nobody wants a fake wood keyboard, bulky and thick keyboards, or just a flat out ugly keyboard accompanying their computer, tablet, or phone...so just take a moment to let the 'patheticness' of the wood keyboards that are currently on the market today waft over you.......

PHEW!! Now that the pain is over you can rejoice in our premium 100% natural and environmentally friendly wood keyboard. We decided to start from square one and get rid of every thought in our head about existing wood keyboards.

Here is the breakdown on how we got to where we are today....and of course it all starts with..........

....followed by the notorious ""chicken-scratch"" sketches...


....onto 2-D drawings...technical drawings...and 3-D models...





....finally to the production of the samples...




Everything...check below and see for yourself!

100% Natural Bamboo
Environmentally Friendly
Wireless (Bluetooth)
Usable with any Bluetooth-friendly device
Plastic-based keys to leave them easy flowing and functional
Command and FN function keys
Various ""Apple-friendly"" keys
Charger cable included (lasts about three months on one charge)
Elevated design
Lightweight (1.25 lb...493 g)
Compact (11.49 in x 4.92 in...29.2cm x 12.5 cm)
Letters/symbols are laser-engraved
Slim


Of course we use natural wood...

The Bluetooth transmitter...

The lowdown on how this all works...

Here is the details on how to pair the keyboard with your device...
1.  Go to your device's settings.
2.  Turn the keyboard on by pressing the on/off switch located on the back of the keyboard (a blue light will flash briefly to indicate the keyboard is turned on).
3.  Go to the Bluetooth settings of your device.

4.  If the Bluetooth is turned off, tap the button to turn it on, and Bluetooth will begin searching for devices.

5.  Next, hold down the pairing button on the back of the keyboard until the blue light starts flashing.  When the ""Wireless Keyboard"" appears, tap on it, enter the code on the keyboard when prompted, and then press enter.

6.  You have successfully paired the keyboard with your device and it is ready to be used!

7.  When you are finished using the keyboard press the on/off switch on the back of the keyboard.

Now it's time for some HD photos of the keyboard. The sleek, stylish, revolutionary, and lightweight design of the keyboard makes our keyboard the best in the world. You will not be disappointed with this natural keyboard...heck it even smells good too! 







WOW!!!  We are starting our rewards off with the keyboard at over 50% off! We have definitely put together some great rewards for you at a discounted price from which they will retail at. All orders placed within the U.S. will receive free shipping! FYI, the shipping method for U.S. Residents will be 2-3 Day Priority Mail. We will happily shipWORLDWIDE, but if you live outside the U.S. the additional shipping price is noted in the pledge you choose, and for International orders the shipping will be First-Class International and the shipping time for global orders depends on where you live. Finally, no matter which level you pledge at you will be deemed an ""Honorary Mention"" on our original backers section of our website (www.thewoodshop.co) and if you pledge at least $5 we will send you a handwritten letter signed by us!


Before we get into the details I want to share with you a bit about myself and the team that helped make this all possible. My name is Chase and I am the founder and creator of The Woodshop at age 17. My brother Chris, who is 19, is majoring in product/industrial design. We have taught and learned from each other (with some help from the his college courses of course) how to work various CAD programs which has enabled us to design the best wooden keyboard in the world. Not to mention we are not rookies in the world of design and business. We owned and operated a clothing company that sold products in all 50 states and over 20 countries globally. Everything we have done could not have been accomplished without the help and support of our parents.



We are doing this because....it is our passion! We have recently become obsessed with wood products and with our newly acquired CAD skills....hence my new design for wooden keyboards. Throughout this process we have acquired one of the most durable woods in the world, bamboo. Each keyboard is different from any other because no two trees are alike. Furthermore, our keyboard is meant to last a lifetime. Each keyboard is created with the environment in mind, and designed to be as eloquent as the materials it is made out of. Finally, our strong love for nature is instilled in each and every keyboard.

Three words….WE NEED YOU! Hopefully you know that this project on Indiegogo will work as an all or nothing funding platform. This means that if we do not completely reach our full funding goal we get nothing. You are the key that unlocks The Woodshop to the world. Without your help everything we have been working on will have simply gone to waste.
Once again….WE NEED YOU! It would be so helpful if you could simply like and share our Facebook page, follow and tweet at us, send texts and emails to your friends, and anything else you can do to help us get the word out.

<p><span>Introducting <a href=""http://www.microsdtomicrousb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>MicroSD to Micro USB adapter</strong></a>. This indiegogo project aims to receive funding for the creation of a tiny adapter -- the worlds first of it's kind so you no longer have to worry about running out of space for your favourite videos, music or photos. All we need is your support to help fund the creation of this adapter.</span></p>
<p>Add additional storage to that newly announced Samsung Nexus 10, and LG Nexus 4 devices.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LRItJ6lGgts/UJWyjjC10YI/AAAAAAAADXg/8cx4Yc2C31s/s640/IMG_20121103_124524.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The adapter is so small it can happily sit with your keys as a keyring; store the whole of your favourite TV series, music collection and mo<span class=""searchBubble"" id=""searchBubble""></span>re in the palm of your hands.</p>
<p><span>Support the project and be the first to receive the adapter. If the project doesn't get funded, your receive a full refund, nothing to lose.</span></p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.microsdtomicrousb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>MicroSD to Micro USB Adapter</strong></a> works with “rooted” Android devices, Linux Mass Storage Class Drivers, Windows® Vista™, Windows® XP, ME and OSX, USB 2.0 support and the smallest package in the market.</p>
<p>The Adapter is based on a fast 8051 microprocessor, High-speed USB 2.0 compatible transfer rates and a Secure Digital (SD) Controller capable of high-performance throughput &gt; 35MB/s with new Hi-Speed formats.</p>
<p><strong>Plug-and-Play Installation with No Software Required* </strong>(Android devices require root access)<br/>The adapter features easy plug-and-play installation--no additional drivers or software are required<strong>*</strong>. Simply insert your microSD card into the memory card reader and plug the reader into your device’s MicroUSB port to begin transferring files.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jKX3Vjxhnl4/UJV2PppaU3I/AAAAAAAADXM/EjASRbQ_nmM/s640/New_Cover_Image-V2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div class=""template asset""><strong>USB 2.0 for High-Speed File Transfer</strong></div>
<p>Fully compatible with USB 2.0, the reader transfers files quickly and efficiently. Even bulky files like HD video will transfer within minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Compact, Ergonomic Design</strong><br/>Featuring a compact, pocket-sized design, smallest package in the market yet, the Adapter lets you transfer photos to and from your microSD card wherever you go. Transfer via the MicroUSB reader for your computer or mobile device.</p>
<h1><strong>Why do we need an adapter?</strong></h1>
<p>The European Commission approved a policy requiring all mobile phones to adopt the standard Micro USB charging and communication connector beginning in January 2011, Up until now all the adapter you can find in the market are MicroSD to USB so that you can transfer your MicroSD card information to your USB enabled computer or device.</p>
<p>However those devices like the Galaxy Nexus or the <strong>Nexus 7, Nexus 4, Nexus 10</strong> that lack the native MicroSD slot are left in the dark, A MicroSD to Micro USB adapter would allow any device with a MIcro USB port (OTG) to expand its internal memory capacity by allowing you to swap external memory cards (MicroSD).</p>
<p>The small package would allow the user to leave the adapter plugged to the device without interfering with its useage or form factor.</p>

MicroSD to Micro USB Adapter
What if you could add more storage to any Android device with a tiny adapter?
Introducting MicroSD to Micro USB adapter. This indiegogo project aims to receive funding for the creation of a tiny adapter -- the worlds first of it's kind so you no longer have to worry about running out of space for your favourite videos, music or photos. All we need is your support to help fund the creation of this adapter.
Add additional storage to that newly announced Samsung Nexus 10, and LG Nexus 4 devices.

The adapter is so small it can happily sit with your keys as a keyring; store the whole of your favourite TV series, music collection and more in the palm of your hands.
Support the project and be the first to receive the adapter. If the project doesn't get funded, your receive a full refund, nothing to lose.
The MicroSD to Micro USB Adapter works with “rooted” Android devices, Linux Mass Storage Class Drivers, Windows® Vista™, Windows® XP, ME and OSX, USB 2.0 support and the smallest package in the market.
The Adapter is based on a fast 8051 microprocessor, High-speed USB 2.0 compatible transfer rates and a Secure Digital (SD) Controller capable of high-performance throughput > 35MB/s with new Hi-Speed formats.
Plug-and-Play Installation with No Software Required* (Android devices require root access)The adapter features easy plug-and-play installation--no additional drivers or software are required*. Simply insert your microSD card into the memory card reader and plug the reader into your device’s MicroUSB port to begin transferring files.

USB 2.0 for High-Speed File Transfer
Fully compatible with USB 2.0, the reader transfers files quickly and efficiently. Even bulky files like HD video will transfer within minutes.
Compact, Ergonomic DesignFeaturing a compact, pocket-sized design, smallest package in the market yet, the Adapter lets you transfer photos to and from your microSD card wherever you go. Transfer via the MicroUSB reader for your computer or mobile device.
Why do we need an adapter?
The European Commission approved a policy requiring all mobile phones to adopt the standard Micro USB charging and communication connector beginning in January 2011, Up until now all the adapter you can find in the market are MicroSD to USB so that you can transfer your MicroSD card information to your USB enabled computer or device.
However those devices like the Galaxy Nexus or the Nexus 7, Nexus 4, Nexus 10 that lack the native MicroSD slot are left in the dark, A MicroSD to Micro USB adapter would allow any device with a MIcro USB port (OTG) to expand its internal memory capacity by allowing you to swap external memory cards (MicroSD).
The small package would allow the user to leave the adapter plugged to the device without interfering with its useage or form factor.

FAQs
1. Would it be possible to mount the usb connector below the circuit board so it sticks out as little as possible? I think most people would prefer a slightly thicker adapter than a long one. Or so that it's going at a right-angle rather than the standard usb pen-sticking-out-ready-to-be-broken design.
Not really possible, the connector is edge mounted (it have 3 pings on the bottom of the board, and 4 on the top), this is again for mechanical support, there is not way to mount the socket on the same plane as the connector, (however i can move most of the hardware bellow the socket, so the connector can be closer to the socket, I think I can cut 0.2 inches more)
2. In the final design would it be possible to add a hole in edge of the adapter to attach it as a keyring?
Yes, I was planning on adding a small hole on the corner for a keyring placement3. It would be good if the connection part could be retracted inside the device, like some usb pen drives in order to protect the connection, or alternatively design a protective cap.
Retractable designs are very complex, and actually add size to the device when it is ""open"" not to mentioned complexity to the molding. I rather stay away from it for right now. However a protective cap for the plug is planned, but not as part of the initial Rewards/Perks fulfillment.
4. Where do I add money for international shipping?
When you select a contribution level, you're prompted to enter in the total contribution amount just below.  This is for people that want international shipping, or if you want to toss a few extra bucks our way just to be nice.

<h1><strong>Experience Integrated Ergonomics with uChair: Relaxable, Comfortable and Healthy</strong></h1>
<p>uChair™ will help PC users release the strain on the neck, shoulder and body, and offer a more relaxable, comfortable and healthier position with five patented innovations:</p>
<p><strong>Integrated Ergonomic Design—</strong>Providing systematic protection from head to foot with backrest, seat cushion and foot rest devices, which enables users to realize the true ergonomic benefits. uChair will help you fully relax in a 125-135 degree reclined position, which, according to latest ergonomic research, is the best-recommended position to evenly distribute pressure on the vertebrate. Users can also adjust the position of the  backrest to suit their best needs, along with the adjustable seat cushion, neck rest cushion and lumbar support. The special designed pressure release slots will also improve the release of concentrated pressure on the vertebrate. </p>
<p><strong>Split Keyboard in the Armrests</strong>—To help users relax their shoulders and neck when they need to type, we split the keyboard in the armrests. Yes, it requires a little practice, but it is definately a worthwhile effort. There is a mouse area on the right armrest (keyboards for left handed users are available at  their request), with four USB ports and an earphone/microphone port available. </p>
<p><strong>Foot-Control Mouse</strong>—Offering users a pair of foot switches working as any key or key combination of keyboard and mouse, to encourage more exercises of the lower body. Users still need to use a regular mouse to control the direction. Recent research by health experts indicates: <strong>Sitting is the new smoking</strong>, and we would like to encourage users to exercise their legs and feet more during their operations of computers. For gamers who spend more than 5-6 hours a day, we highly recommend this feature to help them do more exercises  while increasing the enjoyment with the additional operating control devices. </p>
<p><strong>Universal Bracket</strong>—Helping users to adjust the monitor to the most suitable position and protect their eyesight effectively. An LCD monitor up to 29” is supported, and most laptops in market as well as iPad 3-4 could be equipped easily with special supporters. iMac users please select the pledge indicating support iMac. Multiple monitors are not supported at the current stage. </p>
<p><strong>Embedded Cable Management</strong>-- Embedded design provides neat, clear and fashionable cable management. No more messy cables here and there.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/825/282/8ee52ec9c3d72b3bda8f7f42f367cabe_large.jpg?1376375120"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Liberation Sans', FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;""/></p>

<h1><strong>World’s First Cloth-Size-Based PC Chair: the best possible fit to your body curve  </strong></h1>
<p>Compare to the traditional One-Size-Fit-All’s chair production, uChair applies an innovative cloth-size-based design allowing users to select their own uChair size for a best possible fit. Users could select their custom uChair based on sizes they understand easily, namely the clothing sizes. The chair backrest, seat cushion, neck rest and skelton are especially sized to fit different user’s body curves and provide a better comfort and support. </p>

<h1><strong>Why do we need your support?</strong></h1>
<p>We have done a lot of work in the last three years, including R&amp;D in Integrated Ergonomics, patents and brand application, prototyping, assessing manufacturers and suppliers, etc. Now we come to Indiegogo to ask your support to realize the World’s First Integrated Ergonomic PC chair, also the First Cloth-Size-Based ergonomic chair.</p>
<p>Because of the patented innovation, uChair is a complex system that allows users to adjust the backrest, neck rest, seat cushion, armrests,  bracket and foot rest to the position they want, which means special adjustment mechanic parts have to been designed and molded for manufacture.</p>
<p>Cloth-Size-Based design &amp; production will help user to find a comfy chair to best fit their body curve on a mass production scale. At the same time, it also means an initial investment for at least 16 different sets of mold for backrest, seat cushion, arm rest and parts of the skeleton has to be made. Is that worthy to do it? The answer is definitely YES. Providing a better users’ experiences is not only our mission, but also more valuable comparing to the increase on the molding expenses.</p>
<p>Therefore, initial production volume for uChair is very crucial. With supporters’ size preference, we could make a better production plan. With your funding, we can start molding and tooling and get the uChair into production phase. Our goal is to get as many supporters as we can to make uChair come to reality.</p>
<p><strong>Prototypes</strong></p>
<p>We currently have three prototypes, one is for our industrial design(shown as follows) and  one for mechanic design and verification. The last one is as shown in video, which is made of steel, aluminum alloy, plastic, sponge foam, leather and textile, with the laptop supporter on it. It also delivers the full uChair functionality and experience, with the adjustable function of backrest, neck rest, seat cushion, armrests, bracket, and foot rest. Split keyboard and foot-control mouse are also fully functional.</p>
<p><strong>Software to Foot-control mouse</strong></p>
<p>Users can customize the foot control mouse with any key or key combination of the keyboard and/or mouse button by easy configuration in the application software, which is developed by our supplier and ready for download from our website:<a href=""http://www.uchair.cn/english/Download"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.uChair.cn/english/Download</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/763/439/afb08acfb22083d6278cacd2c6e1004c_large.jpg?1374373237"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>The design of the manufactured product would vary slightly from the prototype: uChair Basic and Superior would be made of Nylon Mesh used for office chair, and uChair Limited Edition would be made of leather in classic green. There would be two magic stickers on the backrest for the neck rest adjustment. The skeleton of the current prototype is made of aluminum alloy and the manufactured product would be made of steel and Injection Molded Plastic. And, of course, the laptop in the video and picture is not included in the award.</p>
<h1><strong>Team</strong></h1>
<p>Thanks to the clustered manufacturing capabilities of Suzhou in China, we are able to work closely with our manufacturers to take an advantage of the flexible production capabilities at an affordable cost to provide cloth-size-based uChair products.</p>
<p>We have also been working very productively with our parts and components suppliers in China, to speed up our production process.</p>
<p>Ditang (Beijing) Design made an exceptional industrial design with comfy, healthy and fashionable concept in mind. uChair Technologies and Ditang Design had set up jointly an Integrated Ergnomic Engineering Center in Beijing for collabarating of the industrial design and test of the Integrated Ergonomics.</p>
<h1><strong>Production Plan</strong></h1>
<p><em>Phase 1:  </em>Manufacturing Engineering Preparation- Scheduled completion Sep 2013</p>
<p><em>Phase 2:  </em>Molding and Tooling - Scheduled completion Oct 2013</p>
<p><em>Phase 3:  </em>Pre-production and Products Certification - Scheduled completion Nov 2013</p>
<p><em>Phase 4:  </em>Formal Production - Scheduled start Dec 2013</p>

<p class=""dotty""><span>Within the last 3 years, we have encountered and resolved many difficulties in our R&amp;D and prototyping process. The cloth-size-based design &amp; production approach is one of the major challenges we met during our R&amp;D. For our first prototype, which is designed and made according to my cloth size, i.e., XXL, we found smaller sized product testers did not feel very comfortable because their body curve was not fully supported by the backrest and seat cushion. Their hands had to extend uncomfortably because of the position of split keyboard in the armrests. We had spent more than 6 months and finally found the solution at the inspiration of the garments industry practice.</span></p>
<p>uChair is not a simple piece of furniture, since the adjustment mechanism is much more complicated compared to a regular ergonomic chair. With our last prototype in the video, we have already completed the verification of the mechanic design and ready to proceed to the production phase.</p>
<p>Another challenge for us to successfully deliver the uChair is that we also need to find the qualified suppliers for the components and parts, such as, foot-control mouse, split keyboard and bracket. The quality control would be a major risk to ensure users’ experiences to uChair. We have been working with the suppliers for more than two years. They have been in the industry for more than 5 years and are very experienced in the quality control and U.S. standards. We are very confident to their capabilities on components and parts' manufacturing, delivery, and quality assurance.</p>
<p>For international shipping and customs clearance, one of our team members has been in the international trade business to U.S. for more than 17 years. So we will be well prepared to make the international shipping from China to U.S.or other destination, and find qualified transportation company to deliver uChair directly to your door.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we also need to pass the CCC and FCC certification, required by U.S. and China regulation for exported &amp; imported IT product. We have made a thorough checking list during our designing process and make sure our suppliers are experienced in the relevant requirement. The major risk would be the time consuming process of the certification. We have anticipated enough time and will work on it paralleling to pre-production manufacturing phase.</p>

Experience Integrated Ergonomics with uChair: Relaxable, Comfortable and Healthy
uChair™ will help PC users release the strain on the neck, shoulder and body, and offer a more relaxable, comfortable and healthier position with five patented innovations:
Integrated Ergonomic Design—Providing systematic protection from head to foot with backrest, seat cushion and foot rest devices, which enables users to realize the true ergonomic benefits. uChair will help you fully relax in a 125-135 degree reclined position, which, according to latest ergonomic research, is the best-recommended position to evenly distribute pressure on the vertebrate. Users can also adjust the position of the  backrest to suit their best needs, along with the adjustable seat cushion, neck rest cushion and lumbar support. The special designed pressure release slots will also improve the release of concentrated pressure on the vertebrate. 
Split Keyboard in the Armrests—To help users relax their shoulders and neck when they need to type, we split the keyboard in the armrests. Yes, it requires a little practice, but it is definately a worthwhile effort. There is a mouse area on the right armrest (keyboards for left handed users are available at  their request), with four USB ports and an earphone/microphone port available. 
Foot-Control Mouse—Offering users a pair of foot switches working as any key or key combination of keyboard and mouse, to encourage more exercises of the lower body. Users still need to use a regular mouse to control the direction. Recent research by health experts indicates: Sitting is the new smoking, and we would like to encourage users to exercise their legs and feet more during their operations of computers. For gamers who spend more than 5-6 hours a day, we highly recommend this feature to help them do more exercises  while increasing the enjoyment with the additional operating control devices. 
Universal Bracket—Helping users to adjust the monitor to the most suitable position and protect their eyesight effectively. An LCD monitor up to 29” is supported, and most laptops in market as well as iPad 3-4 could be equipped easily with special supporters. iMac users please select the pledge indicating support iMac. Multiple monitors are not supported at the current stage. 
Embedded Cable Management-- Embedded design provides neat, clear and fashionable cable management. No more messy cables here and there.




World’s First Cloth-Size-Based PC Chair: the best possible fit to your body curve  
Compare to the traditional One-Size-Fit-All’s chair production, uChair applies an innovative cloth-size-based design allowing users to select their own uChair size for a best possible fit. Users could select their custom uChair based on sizes they understand easily, namely the clothing sizes. The chair backrest, seat cushion, neck rest and skelton are especially sized to fit different user’s body curves and provide a better comfort and support. 
Indiegogo backers, please provide the gender and size preference information according the following:
 
Specifications of uChair
uChair in package:181cm*82cm*90cm;
uChair in use:210cm(Max)*82cm*110cm(Max).
Net Weight:70KG
Materials of uChair:

Why do we need your support?
We have done a lot of work in the last three years, including R&D in Integrated Ergonomics, patents and brand application, prototyping, assessing manufacturers and suppliers, etc. Now we come to Indiegogo to ask your support to realize the World’s First Integrated Ergonomic PC chair, also the First Cloth-Size-Based ergonomic chair.
Because of the patented innovation, uChair is a complex system that allows users to adjust the backrest, neck rest, seat cushion, armrests,  bracket and foot rest to the position they want, which means special adjustment mechanic parts have to been designed and molded for manufacture.
Cloth-Size-Based design & production will help user to find a comfy chair to best fit their body curve on a mass production scale. At the same time, it also means an initial investment for at least 16 different sets of mold for backrest, seat cushion, arm rest and parts of the skeleton has to be made. Is that worthy to do it? The answer is definitely YES. Providing a better users’ experiences is not only our mission, but also more valuable comparing to the increase on the molding expenses.
Therefore, initial production volume for uChair is very crucial. With supporters’ size preference, we could make a better production plan. With your funding, we can start molding and tooling and get the uChair into production phase. Our goal is to get as many supporters as we can to make uChair come to reality.
Prototypes
We currently have three prototypes, one is for our industrial design(shown as follows) and  one for mechanic design and verification. The last one is as shown in video, which is made of steel, aluminum alloy, plastic, sponge foam, leather and textile, with the laptop supporter on it. It also delivers the full uChair functionality and experience, with the adjustable function of backrest, neck rest, seat cushion, armrests, bracket, and foot rest. Split keyboard and foot-control mouse are also fully functional.
Software to Foot-control mouse
Users can customize the foot control mouse with any key or key combination of the keyboard and/or mouse button by easy configuration in the application software, which is developed by our supplier and ready for download from our website:www.uChair.cn/english/Download.

Design
The design of the manufactured product would vary slightly from the prototype: uChair Basic and Superior would be made of Nylon Mesh used for office chair, and uChair Limited Edition would be made of leather in classic green. There would be two magic stickers on the backrest for the neck rest adjustment. The skeleton of the current prototype is made of aluminum alloy and the manufactured product would be made of steel and Injection Molded Plastic. And, of course, the laptop in the video and picture is not included in the award.
Team
Thanks to the clustered manufacturing capabilities of Suzhou in China, we are able to work closely with our manufacturers to take an advantage of the flexible production capabilities at an affordable cost to provide cloth-size-based uChair products.
We have also been working very productively with our parts and components suppliers in China, to speed up our production process.
Ditang (Beijing) Design made an exceptional industrial design with comfy, healthy and fashionable concept in mind. uChair Technologies and Ditang Design had set up jointly an Integrated Ergnomic Engineering Center in Beijing for collabarating of the industrial design and test of the Integrated Ergonomics.
Production Plan
Phase 1:  Manufacturing Engineering Preparation- Scheduled completion Sep 2013
Phase 2:  Molding and Tooling - Scheduled completion Oct 2013
Phase 3:  Pre-production and Products Certification - Scheduled completion Nov 2013

</div></div>","When designing AlphaTank, we wanted to maintain a slim design while also creating a battery pack with industry-leading capacity. We designed AlphaTank to utilize a unique 8-cell stacked lithium-Ion battery. This compact design gives it an industry-leading 30,000mAh charge capacity while still remaining slim and portable. 


AlphaTank finally allows you to keep all your essential devices charged on-the-go. With its incredibly large 30,000mAh capacity and multiple USB output types (USB-A, USB-C), Alphatank has the power to charge all your devices, from your MacBook to your DSLR camera. AlphaTank is so powerful in fact, it can keep your iPhone XS charged for over a week! 


Although AlphaTank rarely needs to be recharged due to its incredibly large capacity, we designed the recharge process to be as convenient as possible. We gave AlphaTank three unique input ports, so you can use any phone charger available (USB-C, Micro USB, Lightning) to recharge.



Keep your MacBook charged on-the-go thanks to Alpha-Tank's PD USB-C input/output port. AlphaTank has the power to keep a MacBook Pro 15"" charged for over 9 hours! That's more than enough time to keep you productive or entertained while you're traveling.


We equipped AlphaTank with two USB-A output ports and one PD fast-charging USB-C port, so you can keep three devices charged at once.


AlphaTank utilizes the all-new QC3.0 charging protocol allowing for step-less multi-voltage charging for multiple devices. Connect 3 unique devices, and AlphaTanks smart chip with QC3.0 will recognize each individual device, supplying it with the perfect voltage and current for an optimal charging state.



We designed AlphaTank to be fully compatible with two-way PD fast-charging. AlphaTank can fast charge any compatible phone in as little as an hour! But that's not all. AlphaTank can also be fast-charged through its USB-C input/output port from empty to full in under two hours!



For added convenience, we included a non-intrusive, bright LED display at the top of AlphaTank. This minimalistic display only shows essential charging information. With just the touch of a button, see percent charge remaining, Voltage, and Amperage.


Finally, when designing Alphatank, we focused on giving it a slim and portable design. With its smooth and flat design, AplhaTank slips effortlessly into any backpack or briefcase, making it the perfect choice for travel. 




We aimed to keep the reward options simple. Pick from our 1,2, 5, or 10 pack options to save anywhere between 40% and 48% off future retail prices! You can't go wrong!


Once completely funded, we will begin the manufacturing process. We are currently aiming to start early shipments sometime early November 2019.",26.0,1,"1 Campaign

Summary
This project was inspired in part by my late grandfather who was an electrical engineer.  I acquired a number of EE items from him including a bunch of wire wrap tools and sockets.  This lead me to realize how useful the ""dying"" art of wire wrap can be.  To this end I wanted to make an educational kit to help people learn how to wire wrap.  This is more than just a kit, it is a whole educational program.  There will be skill badges, wire wrap comics, and kits.  I am also planing several instructional videos and online tutorials.
If you don't know what wire wrap is there is a decent overview here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wrap
 
Why ANOTHER Arduino clone?
After much thought about what kind of kit to make I settled on an Arduino clone because the design is fairly simple yet very versatile.  The design is very barebones, with no USB and no advanced power management or 3.3v supply.  The goal of this kit is to be educational and decorative first, and to be a Arduino clone second.
 
What We Need & What You Get
The money raised is to leverage volume buys and insure that prices are low enough to enable a wide range of people to learn from these materials.
The rewards are:


Skill badge - 1.7"" diameter round embroidered patch


Comic - 20 page ""Wire Wrap is Still Useful and Soldering is Easy"" comic book


Basic kit - PCB, Components, Standoffs, and Acrylic base plate


Deluxe Kit - Basic Kit + wire wrap tool


Super Deluxe Kit - Deluxe Kit + Comic and Badge


Super Deluxe Kit with FTDI - Super Deluxe Kit + FTDI adapter


Advertiser special - Super Deluxe Kit + a 2.9in x 2.9in inside front cover ad in the comic


Hackerspace specials

 
The Impact
This project helps preserve a dying skill and teach people new skills.  It is more than just a kit, it is also an educational experience and a beautiful completed project.  It is a great conversation starter and gives you a certain nerd cred to have made a wire wrap kit.
This is my second major project, the first was the InkShield.  This is also the beginning of a more substantial effort with nerdy projects as I am launching a new site called NerdCreationLab.com which will have more educational kits in the near future.  It will also have many resources for Makers, Hackers, and Nerds of all kinds.

incredibly attached to our smartphones and never like to feel “out of the
loop”. However, day to day activities such as work, sport and travel mean that
we can’t have our eyes on the screen 100% of the time. We all suffer from a
form of FOMO (fear of missing out) when it comes to missed calls, messages and
alerts and not being able to check our phone can cause us to be distracted and
lose concentration. We are here to solve this problem and bring you a whole new
way of keeping connected.The
Telltale Scoop is a revolutionary piece of wearable technology that will ensure
you won’t miss important activity on your smartphone.  Suitable for all ages, the thin and
lightweight wristband uses subtle vibration and LED indicators to notify you of
activity on your phone when it’s out of sight.


Scoop is
on you wherever you are. Notifications will no longer go unnoticed, even when
your phone is out of reach.


You can
quickly check for missed notifications with a glance, searching for your phone
to check for content is now a thing of the past.


If you
are unable to attend to an alert right away, discrete LEDs will remind you
about the missed notifications on your phone.


With
customized alert settings you will know what type of notification has been
received and from which contact, allowing you to decide if you should react to
the notification.

More than
just phone calls and messages, Scoop will notify you about push notifications
from Facebook, Twitter, alarms, reminders, calendar events and more.

Once synced
with the app (Android and iOS), the Telltale Scoop will vibrate and LED lights
glow to let you know when your smartphone is receiving incoming calls, messages
or alerts.
Bluetooth
connectivity allows for seamless pairing with the smartphone app where you can
completely personalize your Scoop experience. 


Personalize each type of notification (for calls, messages or alerts) with
custom vibration patterns, LED colors and ability to turn LEDs on/off.


Important
contacts can be assigned unique settings for vibration pattern and/or LED
indicator color which makes it possible to identify an incoming notification as
from a particular contact. 


Do Not
Disturb mode limits
vibration duration to a short burst and only provides notifications from
important contacts so at inconvenient times you will only receive notifications
that are important to you.


The app
will also receive push notifications when the Scoop is out of proximity as well
as when the battery is running low.


Various distinct vibration pattern
options


3 multi-color LED indicators


A USB connector hidden within the
clasp for charging and software updates


Long battery life


Android and iOS compatibility


Water resistant

The app
provides the ability to personalize the tri-colored LED lights so that you can
tell the level of urgency of the notification in just a glance. For example you
can set them to glow red for important contacts.
Irrespective
of age or lifestyle the Scoop is useful for a wide range of situations
including:


Around
the home: when a notification is received and the phone was left in another
room. (e.g. watching TV, cooking, gardening).


Not
wanting to be disturbed: when it would interrupt and be rude to check you phone
and/or the phone is on silent and easy to miss a notification.(e.g. a business
meeting, cinema, in school).


In a
social situation: where it is easy to miss an alert or forget to check your
phone. (e.g. noisy active events – coffee shop, bar, music festival, parties,
sporting event, theater).


The Scoop
will ensure you don’t miss out on anything your phone needs to tell you.
The
Telltale Scoop contains a slim rechargeable lithium polymer battery, Bluetooth
chip, vibration motor, LED indicators and USB connector for charging the
device. It is made from a flexible, water resistant TPU plastic that is
comfortable and flexible to wear without irritation. 

Once we
have successfully launched our initial black and white designs, we intend to
add additional colors to our Scoop range, plus research additional features and
updates.
Scoop comes
in S, M and L in both the black and white and you will have the opportunity to
choose your size band just prior to manufacture.The battery
management system includes a rechargeable lithium polymer battery which has a
battery life of 5 days depending on how many calls and texts you receive each
day. The
Telltale Scoop has a USB connector hidden in the wrist band. To recharge,
simply attach this to any USB port and charging will begin.Scoop will
work with Android and iOS smartphones.Via your
smartphone’s Bluetooth connection.The band is
approx 15mm (0.59"") at its widest point, with a height of 8.2mm (0.32"").The
Bluetooth chip has a range of up to 10m in optimal conditions.The product

<li>The application shown in the videos and pictures are still in beta version. It is possible that some features  or designs will be changed in the final version.</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Similarly, the scale shown in the video and pictures (in our blog), are pre-production 3D-Printed prototypes. The final look and details of the scale, could change slightly, but only if a change would be beneficial.</span><br/>

RewardsStretch GoalsWhy do we need you?We are software developers and we know a lot about what there is to know about making digital products, but as we've learned over the past few months: building hardware is costly. We've done as much work as possible and spend all of our salaries on making the prototypes, but to get to the next stage of production we'll need molds, components and factory time. Here're some of the specific things your funds will go towards.
Electronics assembly - Part of your funding will go to the components and their correct assembly on a circuit board. This circuit board is the brain of Wellscale
Injection Molds - With your help, we will be able to manufacture the molds required to produce the body of Wellscale
App development - Honestly, most of your funds won't go here, but we need some coffe to give you both IOS and Android app.
Shipping and packaging - Getting your new Wellscale to you, wherever you are
Our vision for the futureRisks and challengesAs with all crowdfunding campaigns there are inherent risks and challenges. Launching a product is not an easy task, therefore it's important to know where we are now in bringing Wellscale to market.As of the launch of our campaign we have:
A fully working protype and the manufractring contracts for the PCB assembly and molds. A big part of the money will go here.
The app that will accompany the Wellscale, although it's still in beta. We will continue testing it, in order to work out all the bugs and make the app usage easy and intuitive.
Given that the hardware and software are in the final stages of development and provided we reach our fundraising goal, the risks and challenges that we were able to access are the following:
The application shown in the videos and pictures are still in beta version. It is possible that some features  or designs will be changed in the final version.

Similarly, the scale shown in the video and pictures (in our blog), are pre-production 3D-Printed prototypes. The final look and details of the scale, could change slightly, but only if a change would be beneficial.

In the hardware manufacturing, it's possible that there could be delays in the production. The factors that could contribute to this is for example component shortages or problems with the factory.  
We must also be aware that problems can arise during the transportation of the final product. This is highly unlikely, and we ensure a replacement, but it needs to be mentioned nevertheless.
Finally, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!It took quite some time and hard work to have a working protype of the application and Wellscale, but we're really glad we are finally at this stage.We also took the opportunity this time to thank everyone who helped us and encouraged during the development phase, and especially you, for visiting our project and contribute to advancing it farther.The Demand for Accurate Nutrition (History)Freire developed WellScale out of personal need when his his grandmother was diagnosed with diabetes, and her dietary restrictions seemed vague and complicated. Diabetes is a difficult balancing act, and one food item, like a banana, can differ greatly from another banana in amounts of sugar and other nutrients. He knew there was a demand for more precise measurements, both for people who diet for health reasons, and for people trying to gain or lose weight. WellScale offers that solution it a portable package, so users can be confident that they have all the information about what they eat no matter where they eat it.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Hello there! </h2>
</div>
<h3><span>We’re so happy you’re visiting our Indiegogo webpage!</span></h3>
<p><span>This is our great opportunity to get you to know a <strong>new friend for your iPad</strong>. </span></p>
<h3><span>It’s called...</span></h3>
<h3><span><img alt=""Plicopa Brand"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopa_brand_color.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa Brand""/></span></h3>
<p><strong>Plicopá</strong> is both a <strong>case and a support</strong>, entirely made of light cardboard. </p>
<p><img alt=""Plicopa case and support"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/imagem_promo_A.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 0px; float: left;"" title=""Plicopa case and support""/></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>We say it’s a friend, because it <strong>protects your iPad from any collision and supports it in a stable and handy way</strong> whenever you read, write, chat…and so on. </p>
<h3><span>Plicopá is very easy, efficient and eco-friendly.</span></h3>
<p><img alt=""Plicopa usability"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopa_usability.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa usability""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite other cases, <strong>Plicopá</strong> never hides your <strong>iPad’s design, instead it emphasizes it</strong>. While in use,  your iPad’s perfectly visible in all its beauty, whereas when you put it away, <strong>a beautiful totally personalized cover safeguards it</strong>. </p>
<p><img alt=""Plicopa personalized covers"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopa_case_tutti.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa personalized covers""/></p>
<p><strong>Plicopá</strong> has bloomed from a <strong>very simple and functional design idea</strong>, where research for less polluting materials goes hand in hand with attention for aesthetics. Both during the production phase and in the disposal one, <strong>Plicopá is 100% recycable</strong>.</p>
<p>Though sustainability is not the only reason to chose <strong>Plicopá</strong>. The cover graphic is its strong point: in this first phase we have included <strong>60 illustrations made by artists and designers</strong>, among which you can chose your favorite one. But it’s just the beginning. <strong>If you support our project,  we’ll give many others the opportunity to create a unique artwork for Plicopá</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt=""Plicopa Artworks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopa_artworks.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa Artworks""/> </p>
<p><span><strong>Plicopá</strong>’s artwork can be even more personalized: thanks to our new app. PlicopAPP allows you to create your own favorite illustration and get it right at home.</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Plicopa app for iPad"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopapp.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa app for iPad""/></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span>Here’s what we need your help for.</span></h2>
<p><span><strong>On-demand production</strong> and <strong>on-line tools development are very expensive</strong>. Besides, to start our project we need to produce a <strong>special corrugated cardboard</strong>, much more efficient than the standard one. We also need to create <strong>e-commerce</strong>, in order to allow many other artists to deliver new artworks for the cover and get them also to earn some money from their creativity. Finally we would like to develop the <strong>PlicopAPP</strong> and to make it <strong>available for free</strong>.</span></p>

<h2><span>How did the project start?<br/></span></h2>
<h3>It’s an idea by Gustavo Arguello.</h3>
<p><span>“The idea of <strong>Plicopá</strong> started in june 2012 when I bought my iPad and decided to create a cardboard case. As I go crazy about paper-techniques and origami, I studied a way to turn a <strong>simple case into something more</strong>, as I needed to <strong>support</strong> my device while reading, writing, chatting and so on. That’s how I developed the first prototypes and within a few months I reached thed final model.</span><span>""</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Then, together with Carla, I decide to make a step forward and to plan everything in a<strong> more efficient and eco-friendly</strong> way. Carla is an expert of packaging and materials, therefore we searched for suppliers and more sustainable materials </span><span>solutions</span><span>.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>At this point we shared the idea with some or our most <strong>beloved friends</strong>, who supported us from the start and <strong>contributed</strong> to the project by <strong>creating beautiful illustrations”.</strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Plicopá</strong> is the result of the passionate work by Gustavo and Carla, who have lived in Milan for the past 6 years.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s what Gustavo thinks of his project: <strong><em>“I put all my thoughts and heart into this project and I hope you’ll enjoy it just as much as I did while creating it”.</em></strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>And here’s what Carla Martins thinks:<strong><em> “I found a right opportunity to test the knowledge I've achieved to develop a project in a sustainable-design thinking”.</em></strong></span></p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><span><strong>1-How do I make a donation?<br/></strong>It's as easy as<strong> Plicopá!</strong> Just click the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">""contribute now"" pink button</span>. Then insert the amount you’d like to donate <em>(click Don't display my name on the campaign page if you want to be anonymous)</em> and choose your reward or pre-order a <strong>Plicopá</strong><em> (perks)</em>. If your live outside Europe, please add the international shipping fee. Finally you’ll just have to follow the PayPal checkout process. </span></p>
<p><strong>2- How do I pay for it?<br/></strong>You can simply use Payal, but if you don't have a PayPal account, you can also use your credit card. Take care of going through all of the PayPal checkout process in order to complete your donation. <em>(click Continue without login at paypal</em>)</p>
<p><strong>3- Can I just use my credit card without logging to PayPal?<br/></strong>Yes, you don't need to register as a PayPal user, you can simply use your credit card on PayPal.</p>
<p><strong>4-After the donation, when will my card be charged?<br/></strong>Your card will be charged just in case <strong>Plicopá</strong> reaches its goal before till May, 9th. If we do not succeed, don't worry you won’t be ever charged! In facts donations are just pledges till the successful ending of a campaign.</p>
<p><strong>5-Will I be updated about the result of the campaign?<br/></strong>If you click on <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">FOLLOW</span> heart button, underneath our video, you will receive an email with the updates throughout the campaign. If you are a contributor, automatically at the expiration date you will receive an email to inform you if <strong>Plicopá</strong> is successfully funded. </p>
<p><strong>6- What happens if the project won't reach the funding raise? <br/></strong>If <strong>Plicopá</strong> doesn’t  succeed all donations will be cancelled. You won't have to pay for anything, and Plicopá will must try again differently. </p>
<p><span><strong>7- Is the cardboard case designed to be temporary, or is it designed to last? <br/></strong>We chose a special cardboard, which is not standard on market. To be resistant we need a longer fiber and ""F wave"" thickness which provides a durability for at least 6 months. (We have being used everyday the prototype on the last 8 months! ) Of course, it will depend on the use you make of it. To remain 100% recyclable just like paper, it won't be water repellent.</span></p>
<p><strong>8-What does Plicopá mean?<br/></strong>We wanted to create a friendly name with a Italian and Portuguese mix of words. <strong>PLICO</strong> is a Latin word that means TO FOLD, in italian is also a ""sealed envelope with important letters"" and <strong>OPÁ</strong> is a Portuguese interjection of surprise, astonishment or admiration.</p>

<h2><span>Ciao! </span></h2>
<h2><span>Siamo felici che tu sia sulla nostra pagina di Indiegogo!</span></h2>
<p>Questa è per noi una grande occasione per mostrarti <strong>un nuovo amico per il tuo iPad</strong>.</p>
<h3>Si chiama ...</h3>
<p><span><img alt=""Plicopa Brand"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopa_brand_color.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa Brand""/></span></p>
<p><span>Plicopá è una <strong>custodia</strong>, che fa anche da supporto, fatta interamente di cartone, sottile e leggero. </span></p>
<p><span><img alt=""Plicopa case and support"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/imagem_promo_A.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa case and support""/></span></p>
<p><span>L’abbiamo definito amico dell’iPad, perché lo <strong>protegge dagli urti</strong> e <strong>lo sostiene in ogni situazione in modo stabile e comodo </strong>quando devi leggere, scrivere, parlare...ecc.</span></p>
<h3><span>Plicopá è molto semplice, funzionale ed eco-friendly.</span></h3>
<p><img alt=""Plicopa usability"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopa_usability.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa usability""/></p>
<p><span>A differenza dalle altre custodie Plicopá non nasconde il design del tuo iPad, anzi lo mette in mostra. Quando lo usi, <strong>l’iPad si vede in tutto la sua bellezza</strong>, mentre quando lo metti via, viene protetto da una splendida custodia dalla grafica <strong>totalmente personalizzabile</strong>.</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Plicopa personalized covers"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopa_case_tutti.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa personalized covers""/> </p>
<p><span>Plicopá nasce da un’idea di design semplice e funzionale, dove la ricerca di materiali meno inquinanti e l’attenzione all’estetica vanno di pari passo. Sia in fase di produzione che di smaltimento, Plicopá è <strong>riciclabile al 100%</strong>.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Ma l’eco-sostenibilità non è l’unico motivo per scegliere Plicopá. La grafica della cover è il suo punto di forza: in questa prima fase abbiamo inserito oltre <strong>60 illustrazioni fatte da artisti e designer</strong>, tra le quali puoi scegliere quella che preferisci. Ma è solo l’inizio. Se sostieni il progetto, daremo a tanti altri l’opportunità di creare una grafica unica per Plicopá.</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Plicopa Artworks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopa_artworks.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa Artworks""/></p>
<p><span>La grafica di Plicopá può essere <strong>ancora più personale</strong>: grazie alla nostra app. Con <strong>PlicopAPP</strong> potrai creare la cover esattamente come piace a te e riceverla direttamente a casa.</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Plicopa app for iPad"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.martinsarguello.com/img/plicopapp.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Plicopa app for iPad""/></p>
<p><span><strong>Ecco perché abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>La <strong>produzione on-demand</strong> e lo sviluppo degli strumenti on line sono costosi. In più, per avviare il progetto abbiamo bisogno di produrre un <strong>cartone ondulato speciale</strong>, che è molto più funzionale rispetto a ciò che offre il mercato. Poi ci sono il sito di <strong>e-commerce</strong>, che permetterà a tanti artisti diversi di disegnare grafiche nuove e di guadagnare sulle proprie creazioni. Infine, vorremmo <strong>sviluppare la PlicopAPP</strong> e metterla gratuitamente a disposizione.</span></p>

<strong>Com’è nato il progetto?</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</h2>
<h3><strong>È un’idea di Gustavo Arguello.</strong></h3>
<p><em>“L’idea di Plicopá è nata nel giugno del 2012 quando ho comprato il mio iPad e ho deciso di fare una custodia in cartone. Siccome sono un appassionato di cartotecnica e origami, ho studiato un modo per trasformare quella semplice custodia in qualcosa di più, dato che mi serviva anche sostenerlo per leggere, scrivere, parlare su Skype...ecc. È così che ho sviluppato i primi prototipi e nel giro di pochi mesi sono arrivato al modello finale.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Poi, insieme a Carla, ho deciso di andare oltre e cercare di progettare tutto in un modo più efficiente ed eco-friendly. Carla è un’esperta di packaging e materiali, così abbiamo cercato fornitori e materiali più ecosostenibili.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>A questo punto abbiamo condiviso l’idea con alcuni dei nostri amici più cari, che non solo ci hanno sostenuto sin dall’inizio, ma hanno dato un grande contributo realizzando meravigliosi lavori di illustrazione e grafica per le cover.”</em></p>

<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><span><strong>1-Come si fa una donazione?</strong><br/> È facile come <strong>Plicopá</strong>! Clicca sul tasto rosa: “contribute now”. Poi inserisci la cifra che vorresti donare <em>(clicca ""Non mostrare il mio nome sulla pagina della campagna, se vuoi rimanere anonimo</em>) e scegli una ricompensa o il pre-ordine di <strong>Plicopá</strong>. Se non vivi in Europa, per favore aggiungi la quota relativa alla spedizione internazionale. Infine segui le istruzioni di PayPal.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>2-Come posso fare il versamento?</strong><br/> Puoi semplicemente usare PayPal, mase non hai l’account puoi utilizzare la carta di credito. Accertati di seguire tutti i passaggi di PayPal per completare la donazione.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>3-Posso usare la carta di credito senza collegarimi a PayPal?</strong><br/> Certo, non c’è bisogni di registrarti a PayPal, puoi usare semplicemente la tua carta di credito su PayPal.</span> </p>
<p><span><strong>4- Quando verrà effettuato l’addebito sulla carta?</strong><br/> L’addebito sulla carta verrà effettuato solo nel caso in cui Plicopá raggiunga l’obiettivo entro il 9 maggio. Se ciò non avverrà, non sarà effettuato alcun addebito! Infatti le donazioni sono delle semplici promesse di versamento finché la campagna di raccolta non si conclude con successo.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>5-Vengo aggiornato sull’esito della campagna?</strong><br/> Se clicchi sul pulsante SEGUI, sotto il nostro video, riceverai una email con aggiornamenti durante l’intera campagna. Se sei un donatore, alla data di termine della campagna riceverai una email che ti informerà se <strong>Plicopá</strong> ha raggiunto l’obiettivo.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>6-Cosa succederà se il progetto non raggiungere la raccolta fondi?</strong><br/> Se <strong>Plicopá</strong> non ha successo, le donazioni verranno cancellate. Non dovrai pagare alcuna quota e Plicopá dovrà riprovare a finanziarsi in altro modo.</span></p>
<p><strong>7-Il cartone è fatto per durare a lungo?<br/></strong>Abbiamo scelto un tipo speciale di cartone, che non esiste sul mercato standard. Per resistere più a lungo abbiamo scelto una fibra e uno spessore ondulato che fornisce una durata di almeno sei mesi.<em> (Il nostro prototipo lo stiamo usando tranquillamente ogni giorno da 8 mesi)</em>. Ovviamente, dipenderà anche dall’uso che ne fai. Per renderlo totalmente riciclabile come la carta, non l’abbiamo fatto resistente all’acqua. </p>
<p><span><strong>8-Cosa significa Plicopá?</strong><br/> Volevamo dare un nome familiare e amichevole mescolando parole di origine Italiana e Portoghese. <strong>PLICO</strong> è di origine latina e significa avvolgere,  così come <strong>PLICO</strong> significa busta sigillata che contiene lettere importanti e <strong>OPÁ</strong> è un intercalare portoghese di stupore e ammirazione…<br/><br/><strong>9-</strong></span><strong>Plicopá sará disponibili per quale modello di tablet?<br/></strong>Sarà per tutti iPad 1, iPad 2, iPad3, iPad4 e iPad Mini</p>
<div><strong>10-Plicopá potrebbe essere amico dei altri tablets? Perché non ho un iPad. </strong></div>
<div>Plicopá potrà essere fatto a misura del tuo tablets, per questo sarà imprescindibile scegliere il modello corretto nel nostro sito non appena riceverai il CUPOM INDIEGOGO. Se non hai un iPad, ma un altro modello di Tablet, dovrà essere pazienti e aspettare un po per ricevere il tuo Plicopá. Inviaci il tuo suggerimento di Tablet, all'indirizzo e-mail: gustavo@plicopa.com.</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>
<div><strong>11-Quando e come posso scegliere una delle 60 illustrazioni per il mio Plicopá?</strong></div>
<div>Una volta finita la campagna con successo, riceverai un coupon con un numero unico che potrai utilizzarlo per scegliere la tua arte preferita. Funzione come solito e-commerce, basta scegliere l'opzione e inserirlo nel carrello. Prima di concludere l'acquisto avrai lo spazio per inserire il codice del tuo COUPON. Ecco! Il valore verrà visualizzato correttamente sottraendo l'importo donato in crowdfunding.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>Per esempio: se hai scelto Early Adopter con una illustrazioni del catalogo, nel nostro e-commerce sceglierai l'illustrazione e lo inserirai nel carrello della spesa (mostrerà un valore normale di 29 euro). Cliccando in ""finalizzare l'acquisto"" avrà un spazio per l'inserimento del codice coupon. Dopodiché il tuo carrello della spesa mostrerà l'aggiornamento del valore di € 0,00. Opá!

<p>Esta é nossa grande oportunidade de lhe apresentar o <strong>novo amigo do seu iPad</strong>.</p>

<p>Nós costumamos dizer que ele è amigo porque <strong>protege o seu iPad</strong> contra colisões e funciona como <strong>suporte de uma forma estável e prática</strong> sempre que você precisar ler, escrever, bater papo… e o que mais quiser fazer.</p>
<h3>O Plicopá é muito fácil, eficiente e eco-friendly.</h3>

<p>Ao contrário de outros cases, o Plicopá n<strong>ão esconde o design do seu iPad</strong>. Pelo contrário: <strong>ele o valoriza</strong>. Quando usado, a beleza do seu iPad fica perfeitamente visível; quando você guarda, ele se transforma em uma <strong>capa linda e personalizada</strong>, que o protege.</p>

<p>O Plicopá nasceu de uma ideia de design muito simples e funcional, em uma pesquisa por materiais menos poluentes que caminhou lado a lado com a atenção à estética. Tanto na fase de produção quanto na hora do descarte, <strong>o Plicopá é 100% reciclável</strong>.</p>
<p>No entanto, a sustentabilidade não é a única razão para se escolher o Plicopá. O desenho da capa é o seu ponto forte: nesta primeira fase, <strong>incluímos 60 ilustrações criadas por artistas e designers</strong>, das quais você pode escolher sua favorita. Mas isso é só o começo. Se você apoiar o nosso projeto, nós lhe daremos muitas outras oportunidades de criar uma arte única para o seu Plicopá.</p>

<h2><strong>É para isso aqui que precisamos da sua ajuda.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Produção sob medida e ferramentas de desenvolvimento online</strong> são bastante caras. Além disso, para iniciar o nossos projeto, precisaremos produzir um <strong>papelão ondulado especial</strong>, muito mais eficiente que o comum.

Hello there! 

We’re so happy you’re visiting our Indiegogo webpage!
This is our great opportunity to get you to know a new friend for your iPad. 
It’s called...

Plicopá is both a case and a support, entirely made of light cardboard. 

 
We say it’s a friend, because it protects your iPad from any collision and supports it in a stable and handy way whenever you read, write, chat…and so on. 
Plicopá is very easy, efficient and eco-friendly.

 
Despite other cases, Plicopá never hides your iPad’s design, instead it emphasizes it. While in use,  your iPad’s perfectly visible in all its beauty, whereas when you put it away, a beautiful totally personalized cover safeguards it. 

Plicopá has bloomed from a very simple and functional design idea, where research for less polluting materials goes hand in hand with attention for aesthetics. Both during the production phase and in the disposal one, Plicopá is 100% recycable.
Though sustainability is not the only reason to chose Plicopá. The cover graphic is its strong point: in this first phase we have included 60 illustrations made by artists and designers, among which you can chose your favorite one. But it’s just the beginning. If you support our project,  we’ll give many others the opportunity to create a unique artwork for Plicopá.
 
Plicopá’s artwork can be even more personalized: thanks to our new app. PlicopAPP allows you to create your own favorite illustration and get it right at home.

 
Here’s what we need your help for.
On-demand production and on-line tools development are very expensive. Besides, to start our project we need to produce a special corrugated cardboard, much more efficient than the standard one. We also need to create e-commerce, in order to allow many other artists to deliver new artworks for the cover and get them also to earn some money from their creativity. Finally we would like to develop the PlicopAPP and to make it available for free.

 

Starting from 24 Euro special perk (limited for 290 Early-adopters) you will pre-order Plicopá and turn our project into reality.

 

How did the project start?
It’s an idea by Gustavo Arguello.
“The idea of Plicopá started in june 2012 when I bought my iPad and decided to create a cardboard case. As I go crazy about paper-techniques and origami, I studied a way to turn a simple case into something more, as I needed to support my device while reading, writing, chatting and so on. That’s how I developed the first prototypes and within a few months I reached thed final model.""
 
Then, together with Carla, I decide to make a step forward and to plan everything in a more efficient and eco-friendly way. Carla is an expert of packaging and materials, therefore we searched for suppliers and more sustainable materials solutions.
 
At this point we shared the idea with some or our most beloved friends, who supported us from the start and contributed to the project by creating beautiful illustrations”.
 
Do you like it? Thanks to your donation, you’ll help to subsidize the project and you will also bring home to your iPad a new great friend.

Carla Martins e Gustavo Arguello are two brazilian designers that strive to create a design both socially useful and eco-friendly.

 
Plicopá is the result of the passionate work by Gustavo and Carla, who have lived in Milan for the past 6 years.
Here’s what Gustavo thinks of his project: “I put all my thoughts and heart into this project and I hope you’ll enjoy it just as much as I did while creating it”.
 
And here’s what Carla Martins thinks: “I found a right opportunity to test the knowledge I've achieved to develop a project in a sustainable-design thinking”.
 

FAQ
1-How do I make a donation?It's as easy as Plicopá! Just click the ""contribute now"" pink button. Then insert the amount you’d like to donate (click Don't display my name on the campaign page if you want to be anonymous) and choose your reward or pre-order a Plicopá (perks). If your live outside Europe, please add the international shipping fee. Finally you’ll just have to follow the PayPal checkout process. 
2- How do I pay for it?You can simply use Payal, but if you don't have a PayPal account, you can also use your credit card. Take care of going through all of the PayPal checkout process in order to complete your donation. (click Continue without login at paypal)
3- Can I just use my credit card without logging to PayPal?Yes, you don't need to register as a PayPal user, you can simply use your credit card on PayPal.
4-After the donation, when will my card be charged?Your card will be charged just in case Plicopá reaches its goal before till May, 9th. If we do not succeed, don't worry you won’t be ever charged! In facts donations are just pledges till the successful ending of a campaign.
5-Will I be updated about the result of the campaign?If you click on FOLLOW heart button, underneath our video, you will receive an email with the updates throughout the campaign. If you are a contributor, automatically at the expiration date you will receive an email to inform you if Plicopá is successfully funded. 
6- What happens if the project won't reach the funding raise? If Plicopá doesn’t  succeed all donations will be cancelled. You won't have to pay for anything, and Plicopá will must try again differently. 
7- Is the cardboard case designed to be temporary, or is it designed to last? We chose a special cardboard, which is not standard on market. To be resistant we need a longer fiber and ""F wave"" thickness which provides a durability for at least 6 months. (We have being used everyday the prototype on the last 8 months! ) Of course, it will depend on the use you make of it. To remain 100% recyclable just like paper, it won't be water repellent.
8-What does Plicopá mean?We wanted to create a friendly name with a Italian and Portuguese mix of words. PLICO is a Latin word that means TO FOLD, in italian is also a ""sealed envelope with important letters"" and OPÁ is a Portuguese interjection of surprise, astonishment or admiration.

Ciao! 
Siamo felici che tu sia sulla nostra pagina di Indiegogo!
Questa è per noi una grande occasione per mostrarti un nuovo amico per il tuo iPad.
Si chiama ...

Plicopá è una custodia, che fa anche da supporto, fatta interamente di cartone, sottile e leggero. 

L’abbiamo definito amico dell’iPad, perché lo protegge dagli urti e lo sostiene in ogni situazione in modo stabile e comodo quando devi leggere, scrivere, parlare...ecc.
Plicopá è molto semplice, funzionale ed eco-friendly.

A differenza dalle altre custodie Plicopá non nasconde il design del tuo iPad, anzi lo mette in mostra. Quando lo usi, l’iPad si vede in tutto la sua bellezza, mentre quando lo metti via, viene protetto da una splendida custodia dalla grafica totalmente personalizzabile.
 
Plicopá nasce da un’idea di design semplice e funzionale, dove la ricerca di materiali meno inquinanti e l’attenzione all’estetica vanno di pari passo. Sia in fase di produzione che di smaltimento, Plicopá è riciclabile al 100%.
 
Ma l’eco-sostenibilità non è l’unico motivo per scegliere Plicopá. La grafica della cover è il suo punto di forza: in questa prima fase abbiamo inserito oltre 60 illustrazioni fatte da artisti e designer, tra le quali puoi scegliere quella che preferisci. Ma è solo l’inizio. Se sostieni il progetto, daremo a tanti altri l’opportunità di creare una grafica unica per Plicopá.

La grafica di Plicopá può essere ancora più personale: grazie alla nostra app. Con PlicopAPP potrai creare la cover esattamente come piace a te e riceverla direttamente a casa.

Ecco perché abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto.
La produzione on-demand e lo sviluppo degli strumenti on line sono costosi. In più, per avviare il progetto abbiamo bisogno di produrre un cartone ondulato speciale, che è molto più funzionale rispetto a ciò che offre il mercato. Poi ci sono il sito di e-commerce, che permetterà a tanti artisti diversi di disegnare grafiche nuove e di guadagnare sulle proprie creazioni. Infine, vorremmo sviluppare la PlicopAPP e metterla gratuitamente a disposizione.

dal 24 euro potrai pre-ordinare il tuo Plicopá (ricompensa speciale per i primi 290) e trasformare così il nostro progetto in realtà. 



Com’è nato il progetto?

È un’idea di Gustavo Arguello.
“L’idea di Plicopá è nata nel giugno del 2012 quando ho comprato il mio iPad e ho deciso di fare una custodia in cartone. Siccome sono un appassionato di cartotecnica e origami, ho studiato un modo per trasformare quella semplice custodia in qualcosa di più, dato che mi serviva anche sostenerlo per leggere, scrivere, parlare su Skype...ecc. È così che ho sviluppato i primi prototipi e nel giro di pochi mesi sono arrivato al modello finale.
 
Poi, insieme a Carla, ho deciso di andare oltre e cercare di progettare tutto in un modo più efficiente ed eco-friendly. Carla è un’esperta di packaging e materiali, così abbiamo cercato fornitori e materiali più ecosostenibili.
 
A questo punto abbiamo condiviso l’idea con alcuni dei nostri amici più cari, che non solo ci hanno sostenuto sin dall’inizio, ma hanno dato un grande contributo realizzando meravigliosi lavori di illustrazione e grafica per le cover.”
 
Ti piace? Con il tuo contributo aiuti a finanziare il progetto e, in più, ti porti a casa un GRANDE nuovo amico per il tuo iPad.

interpretano il design come qualcosa di utile alla società, ma con una forte attenzione all’ecosostenibilità. 
 
Plicopá è il frutto del lavoro appassionato di Gustavo e Carla, due designer brasiliani che vivono a Milano da 6 anni. 
Ecco cosa pensa Gustavo del suo progetto: “Ho messo un sacco di pensiero e cuore in questo progetto, e mi auguro che tu possa apprezzarlo tanto quanto io mi sono divertito a farlo”. 
Ecco cosa pensa Carla Martins: “Questo progetto mi ha dato una buona opportunità per mettere alla prova le mie competenze per sviluppare un progetto con l’idea di design sostenibile”.
 

FAQ
1-Come si fa una donazione? È facile come Plicopá! Clicca sul tasto rosa: “contribute now”. Poi inserisci la cifra che vorresti donare (clicca ""Non mostrare il mio nome sulla pagina della campagna, se vuoi rimanere anonimo) e scegli una ricompensa o il pre-ordine di Plicopá. Se non vivi in Europa, per favore aggiungi la quota relativa alla spedizione internazionale. Infine segui le istruzioni di PayPal.
2-Come posso fare il versamento? Puoi semplicemente usare PayPal, mase non hai l’account puoi utilizzare la carta di credito. Accertati di seguire tutti i passaggi di PayPal per completare la donazione.
3-Posso usare la carta di credito senza collegarimi a PayPal? Certo, non c’è bisogni di registrarti a PayPal, puoi usare semplicemente la tua carta di credito su PayPal. 
4- Quando verrà effettuato l’addebito sulla carta? L’addebito sulla carta verrà effettuato solo nel caso in cui Plicopá raggiunga l’obiettivo entro il 9 maggio. Se ciò non avverrà, non sarà effettuato alcun addebito! Infatti le donazioni sono delle semplici promesse di versamento finché la campagna di raccolta non si conclude con successo.
5-Vengo aggiornato sull’esito della campagna? Se clicchi sul pulsante SEGUI, sotto il nostro video, riceverai una email con aggiornamenti durante l’intera campagna. Se sei un donatore, alla data di termine della campagna riceverai una email che ti informerà se Plicopá ha raggiunto l’obiettivo.
6-Cosa succederà se il progetto non raggiungere la raccolta fondi? Se Plicopá non ha successo, le donazioni verranno cancellate. Non dovrai pagare alcuna quota e Plicopá dovrà riprovare a finanziarsi in altro modo.
7-Il cartone è fatto per durare a lungo?Abbiamo scelto un tipo speciale di cartone, che non esiste sul mercato standard. Per resistere più a lungo abbiamo scelto una fibra e uno spessore ondulato che fornisce una durata di almeno sei mesi. (Il nostro prototipo lo stiamo usando tranquillamente ogni giorno da 8 mesi). Ovviamente, dipenderà anche dall’uso che ne fai. Per renderlo totalmente riciclabile come la carta, non l’abbiamo fatto resistente all’acqua. 
8-Cosa significa Plicopá? Volevamo dare un nome familiare e amichevole mescolando parole di origine Italiana e Portoghese. PLICO è di origine latina e significa avvolgere,  così come PLICO significa busta sigillata che contiene lettere importanti e OPÁ è un intercalare portoghese di stupore e ammirazione…9-Plicopá sará disponibili per quale modello di tablet?Sarà per tutti iPad 1, iPad 2, iPad3, iPad4 e iPad Mini
10-Plicopá potrebbe essere amico dei altri tablets? Perché non ho un iPad. 
Plicopá potrà essere fatto a misura del tuo tablets, per questo sarà imprescindibile scegliere il modello corretto nel nostro sito non appena riceverai il CUPOM INDIEGOGO. Se non hai un iPad, ma un altro modello di Tablet, dovrà essere pazienti e aspettare un po per ricevere il tuo Plicopá. Inviaci il tuo suggerimento di Tablet, all'indirizzo e-mail: gustavo@plicopa.com.
 

11-Quando e come posso scegliere una delle 60 illustrazioni per il mio Plicopá?
Una volta finita la campagna con successo, riceverai un coupon con un numero unico che potrai utilizzarlo per scegliere la tua arte preferita. Funzione come solito e-commerce, basta scegliere l'opzione e inserirlo nel carrello. Prima di concludere l'acquisto avrai lo spazio per inserire il codice del tuo COUPON. Ecco! Il valore verrà visualizzato correttamente sottraendo l'importo donato in crowdfunding.
 
Per esempio: se hai scelto Early Adopter con una illustrazioni del catalogo, nel nostro e-commerce sceglierai l'illustrazione e lo inserirai nel carrello della spesa (mostrerà un valore normale di 29 euro). Cliccando in ""finalizzare l'acquisto"" avrà un spazio per l'inserimento del codice coupon. Dopodiché il tuo carrello della spesa mostrerà l'aggiornamento del valore di € 0,00. Opá! Così semplice !

<h2>What Makes Our Design Great?</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Our design evolved after several iterations based on input and observations from real users.  We wanted to understand how non-technical users approached the task of learning a new skill.  We wanted to know how elements of the kit made non-technical users feel.</p>
<p>From our observations, we neutralized characteristics that triggered negative emotional responses, then we accentuated those that engendered a more positive response.</p>
<p>The results are culminated in the product below.</p>
<h3><strong>Looks Like a Book</strong></h3>
<p>Easier to access and see means it'll be used more often which translates to greater value.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Q: How did you come up with the idea?</strong></p>
<p>Something clicked for me when I saw expressions of fear and confusion on the faces of two new interns who had just opened a well-used arduino kit.  I quickly grabbed a marker and a white board and asked the interns to describe what they were feeling.  I actually took a picture of it.  Here it is!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482337410/suqmysylnlwlysfb9wun.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It was then I realized that I'd been looking at developing my new kit the wrong way.  I had been concentrating on what things should go in the box.  Instead, I should have been asking how the box and they way it is organized makes people feel when they use it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s in the kit?</strong></p>
<p>The kit will come with the following 245 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>1X 30cm USB cable</li>
<li>1X Arduino-compatible microcontroller</li>
<li>1X Acrylic developers plate</li>
<li>1X Step-by-step project guide booklet</li>

The airplane launcher is just one of the many fun projects you can create with our Inventor's Kit. You will also learn how to make:

...and that's only the beginning!

 
What Makes Our Design Great?

Our design evolved after several iterations based on input and observations from real users.  We wanted to understand how non-technical users approached the task of learning a new skill.  We wanted to know how elements of the kit made non-technical users feel.
From our observations, we neutralized characteristics that triggered negative emotional responses, then we accentuated those that engendered a more positive response.
The results are culminated in the product below.
Looks Like a Book
Easier to access and see means it'll be used more often which translates to greater value.

 
Portable Workspace

 
Preserves Your Work

 
Messy Cables Kept Out of Sight

 
Organized Storage Compartments

 
 
Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How did you come up with the idea?
Something clicked for me when I saw expressions of fear and confusion on the faces of two new interns who had just opened a well-used arduino kit.  I quickly grabbed a marker and a white board and asked the interns to describe what they were feeling.  I actually took a picture of it.  Here it is!

It was then I realized that I'd been looking at developing my new kit the wrong way.  I had been concentrating on what things should go in the box.  Instead, I should have been asking how the box and they way it is organized makes people feel when they use it.
Q: What’s in the kit?
The kit will come with the following 245 parts:

1X 30cm USB cable
1X Arduino-compatible microcontroller
1X Acrylic developers plate
1X Step-by-step project guide booklet
1X USB Thumb drive (2GB) loaded with programs, software, docs, and source code

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>I-CeKub was created by father and son
Stephen and Boris, two individuals passionate for technology. </p>
<p>Boris, as an engineering student, works
everyday with technology and Stephen, as an artistic director with fashion.
Together, both got the idea of tackling the phone’s three nightmares, memory,
battery and system compatibility... and all at once. Soon they came up with
i-CeKub, thus launching an innovative, functional and stylish way of backing,
storing, sharing files. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our first objective goal represents the
cost to fund the creation of a brand new circuit board designed to our needs, the
molding of the casing, production, packaging and shipping of the product
worldwide.</p>
<p>As we reach the goal, you will get a brand
new i-Cekub. It is the new alternative to traditional storage solutions such as connection depend Cloud, Plug and not-always play USB sticks, or 'I cannot see you' Bluetooth. A new and simple option to send, share pictures, videos, files. Using the
proven Wifi technology, i-Cekub is the missing piece that links all devices
together. Your data storage and hub, all in your pocket.</p>
<h3>Facilitating people’s life thanks to you</h3>
<p>Yes, we are a small team,but we take pride in working hard to bring new ideas and
technology to the world. Take part now and contribute in creating a new device
that facilitate everyone’s life!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge remains
of course production costs and dimensions.  We are confident that our team, partly based in China , can manage a day-to-day follow up of the product development. Also, we do get great support from expert
from the Polytechnic school. You will get updated frequently.</p>
<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot donate, you can still be
part of the adventure. Tell your family and friends about us, introduce to potential distributors. Share our links
and help us spreading the word that i-CeKub can be a reality soon! Thank you all.<br/></p>

the refrigerant gas to a high pressure and temperature gas before it passes through the condenser coil.

The high pressure liquid then passes into the evaporator coil and take away the heat of the hotter air that continuously brought in by the centrifugal blower, when its pressure drops.

With more than 20 years of combined engineering experience between us we hope to create gadgets and products that will change the way the world thinks and operates.Risks & ChallengesThe risk are relatively small since we have already done a lot of work on the uMotio and currently have fully working prototypes.Our current employer produces a variety of products and we are directly involved in the production of thousands of units every month. We can easily handle a small production run in-house. Should the demand be much higher, have the know-how and experience to ramp this up. We have confirmed quotes and lead times for outsourced production.FAQQ. What do I need to know about shipping?A. All physical pledges include free surface mail postal shipping. Unfortunately we cannot place any guarantees on your uMotio arriving in a timely fashion. We have a courier pledge available should you want us to courier your uMotio to you.Shipping does not include customs fees, duties and/or taxes you might incur when importing products into your country.Q. Does the uMotio need a computer for gesture processing?A. No, the uMotio does all gesture and tracking processing on-board. Our robot gripper demo is a good example of the uMotio in action without a computer.Q. How sensitive is the uMotio? Will my mobile phone interfere with it?A. The low frequencies (70 - 130 kHz) the uMotio operates on guarantees no interference will disturb the controller. Frequency hopping is also utilized for robustness. We have placed a phone on the tracking pad and while dialing it the uMotio still operated flawlessly.Need more information ?Should you have any questions, concerns or feedback, feel free to contact us in the comments section or at info[at]umotio.comThank you!The uMotio Team",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I love timelapse photography.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Two years ago, driven by a good friend of mine i've decided to give a try on timelapse photography. I had a DSLR camera but didn’t had an intervalometer, so i assembled a small electronic circuit on top of an Arduino Uno, made some basic code  and did my first timelapse movie. The result was awful, but for some reason, i was hooked.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since that day I have never stopped looking for ways to evolve. I studied and tried various techniques until i got better. But, as i got better i felt something was missing. Yes, you guessed it, i needed motion control to give my timelapse movies a cinematographic feel. So, i did a market research and found out that there were great timelapse motion control devices for sell, but all of them were too expensive for me. Well, the next step became clear to me, i was going to make my own 3 axis timelapse motion control system. It had to be really affordable, lightweight, built with quality materials and most importantly, offer extreme freedom in terms of 3 axis motion control. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now that I reached that objective i´ve decided to combine my expertise (electronics and automation engineering) with my wife´s (economics) to launch a startup company and that´s how Timeblocks was born. </p>

I love timelapse photography.
Two years ago, driven by a good friend of mine i've decided to give a try on timelapse photography. I had a DSLR camera but didn’t had an intervalometer, so i assembled a small electronic circuit on top of an Arduino Uno, made some basic code  and did my first timelapse movie. The result was awful, but for some reason, i was hooked.
Since that day I have never stopped looking for ways to evolve. I studied and tried various techniques until i got better. But, as i got better i felt something was missing. Yes, you guessed it, i needed motion control to give my timelapse movies a cinematographic feel. So, i did a market research and found out that there were great timelapse motion control devices for sell, but all of them were too expensive for me. Well, the next step became clear to me, i was going to make my own 3 axis timelapse motion control system. It had to be really affordable, lightweight, built with quality materials and most importantly, offer extreme freedom in terms of 3 axis motion control. 
Now that I reached that objective i´ve decided to combine my expertise (electronics and automation engineering) with my wife´s (economics) to launch a startup company and that´s how Timeblocks was born. 
Why
Our goal is to provide a reliable, strong, versatile, open-source and really affordable timelapse motion control system. In order to achieve this objective we need to manufacture large quantities to lower the unit price. 
By supporting this project you will allow us to launch in a near future an awesome online store with products that will enable timelapse enthusiasts from all over the world to gain access to really affordable motion control systems.



Perks


We know that your money is extremely valuable for you so we made a huge effort to offer the best perks. Here they are:



  tb.shield
It´s an Arduino fully assembled compatible shield that enables you to control two dc motors (up to 2 A each), camera focus, camera shutter and any Skywatcher’s panohead  with the SynScan GOTO protocol (www.skywatcher.com) such as Acuter All in One, Virtuoso Mount and the Allview mount.














            




To learn more  - http://www.timeblocks.wordpress.com/tb-shield/


                                 http://www.timeblocks.wordpress.com/tb-shield/vb_test-new/


  tb.shield + lcd.shield
The same shield as described above plus an interface shield with a great 20x4 serial enabled LCD and 6 buttons plus an Arduino Board with our firmware uploaded. This is the ideal situation for you if you already own a motorized slider (with DC motor) or/and a Skywatcher’s panohead and are looking for a plug and play solution.



Our open-source firmware has some great features like motion ramping, bulb ramping control, the ability to program up to 5 points in space so you can add complex trajectories to your timelapse movies (my favorite feature) among other very cool stuff. If you don´t like our firmware and have programming skills you can use this perk to develop a customized solution that suits your interests or you can adapt and change our open source code. Here's an example of the firmware´s interface for the main menu:



And an example on how to set one of the five points available. Note that you are not obligated to use all the 5 points. You can disable or enable the points at any time and use as much points as you need.


You can also use this firmware to control only one DC motor and the DSLR camera (without the panohead). When you turn on the controller it will automatically detect if there is a panohead connected and the menu will adapt accordingly (if it's not connected the menus related with the yaw and pitch movements will disappear).



* To set the points of the panohead you don't have to measure angles or guess them, you just drive it  to the desired position with the buttons in the controller and the point coordinates will be automatically saved once you exit the ""yaw and pitch"" menu.

Small timelapse video of a 2 axis trajectory:

                


If it has dc motors you can use tb.shield + LCD.shield to automate it. 





  tb.shield + lcd.shield + tb.slider
The same perk as above (arduino board with firmware included/panohead not included) plus an light (2,5 kg), rock solid, 1 meter length black anodized aluminum motorized slider. All the parts of the slider will be cnc machined for maximum precision and great finish. It has a small, high torque motor to enable up to 3,5 Kg of load in vertical operation and up to 6 Kg in horizontal operation. This is also a plug and play solution. 















 

FAQ`s


Does any of the perks include a panohead?



No it doesn´t. We made our controller compatible with all Skywatcher’s panohead  with the SynScan GOTO protocol because they are very affordable and their performance is great.

Does any of the perks include a ready to use solution?
Yes, besides tb.shield all of the other perks will be shipped fully assembled and with firmware installed.

Large modules are stand alone products that can be bought through 3rd 
party companies for around $300-$900.  These modules include a new 
motherboard, cpu, gpu, ram, ssd, & battery.

After doing extensive manufacturing research we have come to the 
conclusion that a fully upgrade-able laptop is not impossible to make, 
its just not profitable.
Why would a multi billion dollar company want to sell you a laptop 
every 10 years when they could sell you a laptop every 2 years?

   What We Need & What You Get  We've already invested over $100,000 of our own money & 2 years of research & development into this company. We need 10k worth of pre-orders to convince investors that this is a product that people want, before we move forward with manufacturing.

This is the worlds first fully upgrade-able laptop and it is built on an open source platform allowing you to upgrade from whatever brands you want.

More than a product we want to generate several interests gathering the community. For a start, we promote the work of five artists who created a panel with their work. These panels are the best choice for the ones that prefer to get a ready-made panel that they like, instead of making one of their own. At the same time, they contribute for the success of those artists. In the future, we want INFINITE FRAME to be a portal where anyone can show and sell their own creative work in the form of an INFINITE FRAME panel.<p>

These perks are especially for the ones that prefer to buy a ready-made panel that they like, more than doing one panel by themselves, and besides that, they are contributing to the success of those artists. In the future anyone can make a panel with his work and propose to sell it through INFINITE FRAME website. You can also go to each Artist website to get to know better his/her work.</p>

However, we also have to consider that these situations can happen and compromise our estimated delivery plan. Nevertheless, we will keep you informed of our production process in the months following the campaign so that you can be always updated regarding the entire process.</p>

<b>HOW DO I CREATE MY FRAMES' PANEL?</b><br/>Simple! Just click on <a href=""http://www.infinite-frame.com/en/do-it-yourself#!"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #F8DE30;"" target=""_blank"">DIY menu of the INFINITE FRAME</a> website (App only available for PCs and laptops at the moment), which has on the horizontal bar below all the available frames. Select and drag to the central area of the screen all the frames you want and put them together to form your panel. Click inside each frame to upload your images and position them inside the frame. Create your account and place your order by following the options. At the payment, you will be redirected to this site where you should make the payment of your order. Register this payment with the same name and email of your INFINITE FRAME account so that we can know which order is yours, and then you will receive your package within the expected delivery time.</p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""font-size: 14px;""><b>MY ORDER ON INFINITE FRAME SITE IS 39.50€. INDIEGOGO DOES NOT ACCEPT CENTS, WHAT SHELL I DO?</b><br/>It's true. INDIEGOGO perks does not accept amounts with cents. So please do the rounding number to the nearest integer of the amount. You can follow these rounding examples: amount 39.50€ round to 40.00€; 44.50€ to 44.00€; 27.40€ to 27.00€; 38.90€ to 39.00€.</p>

The packs of 4+1 frames are with equal frames for practical reasons. To have frames of different sizes you have options: you must acquire different packs of the frames that you want or you go to the  <a href=""http://www.infinite-frame.com/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #F8DE30;"" target=""_blank"">INFINITE FRAME</a> website and make the compositions you want.</p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""font-size: 14px;""><b>HOW DO I HANG THE PANELS ON THE WALL?</b><br/>The fixing parts to connect the acrylic, the photo and the backcard to the frames have on the back a groove to fit to any nail or screw on the wall. The number of nails or screws needed to hang one panel on the wall depends on the size and configuration of the panel. It might need just one or several if it is a big panel.</p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""font-size: 14px;""><b>AFTER BUYING ONE PANEL OF AN ARTIST OR EVEN ONE MADE BY ME, CAN I CHANGE HIS CONFIGURATION?</b><br/>Yes. Any panel can be set and unset any time you want. And its configurations are infinite. They just depend on the number and dimensions of the parts that you have.</p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""font-size: 14px;""><b>I ONLY SEE BLACK FRAMES, DON’T YOU HAVE OTHER COLORS?</b><br/>Yes, we will also produce in this first phase, frames in gray and white, but to acquire these colors, you must place your order through <a href=""http://www.infinite-frame.com/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #F8DE30;"" target=""_blank"">INFINITE FRAME</a> website and make your choices.

Mais do que um produto gostávamos também de gerar conjuntos de sinergias em torno de INFINITE FRAME com a comunidade. Para começar falámos com cinco artistas propondo-lhes que fizessem um painel com o seu trabalho para expor e vender através desta campanha. Desta forma juntamos o interesse de venda do produto com o interesse dos artistas exporem e venderem o seu trabalho. Além disso este pode ser o melhor produto para quem prefere comprar um painel completo com uma composição gráfica já feita que goste, em vez de montar o seu próprio painel com as suas fotos. No futuro gostaríamos que o site INFINITE FRAME pudesse ser uma espécie de portal de divulgação e venda de trabalho não só de artistas mas de qualquer criativo na área de artes visuais que queira expor e vender o seu trabalho através de um painel da marca.<p>

<p>Queremos fazer muito mais pela comunidade, este é só um pequeno passo. O princípio!</p>

<p>Os próximos cinco níveis de ofertas contêm um painel criado com o trabalho de um Artista. Estes níveis de oferta foram criados especialmente para quem prefere comprar um trabalho decorativo já feito de que goste, ao invés de criar um painel com imagens suas. Ao mesmo tempo está a contribuir para o reconhecimento e o sucesso desse Artista. No futuro pretende-se que qualquer criativo que queira divulgar e vender o seu trabalho através de um painel INFINITE FRAME o possa fazer. Por agora pode ajudar estes Artistas e também conhecer melhor os seus trabalhos visitando os seus respetivos sites.

<p>O próximo passo é construir os moldes de injeção para produzir as peças de plástico que permitem conectar e desconectar as peças das molduras entre si e as peças de fixação do acrílico e cartão de fundo às molduras e as molduras à parede. Escolhemos e trabalhamos em parceria com uma empresa Portuguesa de renome Internacional especializada em produzir moldes de injeção. Em paralelo escolhemos e trabalhamos também com uma das melhores Carpintarias Portuguesas com tecnologia CNC (Computer Numeric Control – Comando Numérico Computorizado) para a produção das peças das molduras em MDF.</p>
<p>Trabalhamos também em regime de parceria com outras empresas de diferentes áreas empresariais como: fornecedores de serviços de Informática, Web Design e Marketing, Gestão e Contabilidade, de matéria-prima, de execução e transformação em produto acabado, até à logística e expedição de encomendas, para tornar o projeto INFINITE FRAME realidade.</p>

<p>Qualquer novo projeto acarreta os seus riscos, no entanto nós trabalhamos no sentido de minimizar todas as situações que possam gerar riscos, desde a fase produção até à entrega, e portanto acreditamos que elas não irão acontecer.</p>
<p>Também planeamos uma calendarização dos trabalhos com tempo suficiente para lidar com alguma situação inesperada sem comprometer os prazos de entrega. No entanto temos de admitir que mesmo assim poderão acontecer situações completamente inesperadas que possam atrasar um pouco o processo de produção. Nesse sentido iremos divulgando informação de acompanhamento do processo de produção para manter todos os envolvidos ao corrente do andamento da produção.</p>

More than a product we want to generate several interests gathering the community. For a start, we promote the work of five artists who created a panel with their work. These panels are the best choice for the ones that prefer to get a ready-made panel that they like, instead of making one of their own. At the same time, they contribute for the success of those artists. In the future, we want INFINITE FRAME to be a portal where anyone can show and sell their own creative work in the form of an INFINITE FRAME panel.

We want to do much more, gathering synergies among the community. This is the first step, just the start!


















Artist’s panel. These next five perks have a panel made with different works of five artists. These perks are especially for the ones that prefer to buy a ready-made panel that they like, more than doing one panel by themselves, and besides that, they are contributing to the success of those artists. In the future anyone can make a panel with his work and propose to sell it through INFINITE FRAME website. You can also go to each Artist website to get to know better his/her work.

For efficiency reasons, the frames on this campaign’s perks are only available with black frames, but we are also going to produce grey and white frames. So if you want frames in any of these two colors, please go to the INFINITE FRAME website and choose what you want and order that as we explained above.

We want to produce more colors on this first production, but for that we need to raise more money than the amount asked for this campaign.





All the materials used in INFINITE FRAME are recyclable: Water-repellent fiber wood (MDF); plastic; acrylic and cardboard.





We’ve designed and built the prototypes and the INFINITE FRAME website with specifically designed application to allow people try this product and make their panels before they buy them.
The next step is to build the injection molds to produce the plastic parts to connect/disconnect the frames and the parts to hang the panels on the wall. We’ve chosen and are working hand-to-hand with Portuguese and International manufacturer specialized in injection molds. We’ve also chosen and are working with one of the best Portuguese Carpentry to produce the wooden parts with CNC (Computer Numeric Control) technology.
To make INFINITE FRAME come true, we are working alongside with other different companies from different business areas such as IT service providers, Web Design, and Marketing, Management and Accounting, raw materials, execution and processing into finished products, logistics and shipping orders.













Depending on the size and weight of your order and the country to delivery it, we’ll have different shipping costs. Please select your country on the perk list of countries. To all the orders made in the INFINITE FRAME website you have automatically the shipping cost by selecting your delivery country. But
IMPORTANT: If you want to spare the shipping costs, we have an option for that too. If you live in Portugal or if you are planning to visit our country during the expected delivery date (October 2016), you have the option to collect your order and meet us personally, avoiding the shipping costs. We will previously announce the time and place in the center of Lisbon and Porto, where we will be with your package to receive you. For these two options you must place your order through the INFINITE FRAME website.

Notes:1 - To ship to Portuguese Islands please place your order through the INFINITE FRAME website, because the shipping costs are different for the different perk levels, as you can see here. For: (42.00€)+9.00€; (47.00€)+9.00€; (56.00€)+12.00€; (62.00€)+15.00€; (68.00€)+15.00€; (73.00€)+17.00€; (78.00€)+21.00€; (86,00€)+21.00€; (98.00€)+23.00€ and for the Artists panels (121.00€)+12.00€; (124.00€)+12.00€; (169.00€)+17.00€; (206.00€)+17.00€; (222.00€)+17.00€.
2 - For some countries outside European Union it might be some extra custom taxes that are not included.3 - If your country is not on our list please send us an email to info@infinite-frame.com so that we can check this situation with you.





Any new project carries some risks. We worked to minimize all possible situations that can create risks from the production phase to the delivery phase. So, we believe they won’t happen.
We also planned our work schedules with enough time to deal with any unforeseen situations that may delay the production process, so that we can ship your order on the estimated date. However, we also have to consider that these situations can happen and compromise our estimated delivery plan. Nevertheless, we will keep you informed of our production process in the months following the campaign so that you can be always updated regarding the entire process.





We hope you enjoy INFINITE FRAME so that you can help us to make it come true. But, If by any reason, you cannot contribute financially, please contribute in the other best way, which is, sharing the link of this campaign with all the ones you like and might be interested in INFINITE FRAME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

MY ORDER ON INFINITE FRAME SITE IS 39.50€. INDIEGOGO DOES NOT ACCEPT CENTS, WHAT SHELL I DO?It's true. INDIEGOGO perks does not accept amounts with cents.

THE PACKS OF 4+1 FRAMES ARE WITH EQUAL FRAMES, CAN’T I ATTACH DIFFERENT SIZES OF FRAMES?Yes you can. The packs of 4+1 frames are with equal frames for practical reasons.

HOW DO I HANG THE PANELS ON THE WALL?The fixing parts to connect the acrylic, the photo and the backcard to the frames have on the back a groove to fit to any nail or screw on the wall. The number of nails or screws needed to hang one panel on the wall depends on the size and configuration of the panel. It might need just one or several if it is a big panel.


AFTER BUYING ONE PANEL OF AN ARTIST OR EVEN ONE MADE BY ME, CAN I CHANGE HIS CONFIGURATION?Yes. Any panel can be set and unset any time you want. And its configurations are infinite. They just depend on the number and dimensions of the parts that you have.


I ONLY SEE BLACK FRAMES, DON’T YOU HAVE OTHER COLORS?Yes, we will also produce in this first phase, frames in gray and white, but to acquire these colors, you must place your order through INFINITE FRAME website and make your choices.

É simples. Pode experimentar este produto fazendo os seus painéis e depois encomendá-los, para os receber em casa prontos para aplicar na parede. Simplesmente clique no menu DIY da INFINITE FRAME (App disponível apenas para PCs e laptops presentemente), selecione as molduras que quer, faça o upload das suas fotos e adicione-as às molduras e junte-as para criar o seu painel. Escolha a cor que quer para as molduras e se quer receber em casa também a impressão das fotos. Crie a sua conta e guarde o seu painel. No final, obtém o custo total da sua encomenda.
Quando clicar para pagar no último botão de confirmação da encomenda que diz ""INDIEGOGO"" irá ser reencaminhado para a página de pagamento desta campanha. Coloque o valor de custo da sua encomenda e faça o registo do pagamento  com o mesmo nome e email que utilizou para criar a conta no site INFINITE FRAME para nós sabermos qual é a sua encomenda e a expedir no tempo anunciado.






Mais do que um produto gostávamos também de gerar conjuntos de sinergias em torno de INFINITE FRAME com a comunidade. Para começar falámos com cinco artistas propondo-lhes que fizessem um painel com o seu trabalho para expor e vender através desta campanha. Desta forma juntamos o interesse de venda do produto com o interesse dos artistas exporem e venderem o seu trabalho. Além disso este pode ser o melhor produto para quem prefere comprar um painel completo com uma composição gráfica já feita que goste, em vez de montar o seu próprio painel com as suas fotos. No futuro gostaríamos que o site INFINITE FRAME pudesse ser uma espécie de portal de divulgação e venda de trabalho não só de artistas mas de qualquer criativo na área de artes visuais que queira expor e vender o seu trabalho através de um painel da marca.

Queremos fazer muito mais pela comunidade, este é só um pequeno passo. O princípio!



















Os próximos cinco níveis de ofertas contêm um painel criado com o trabalho de um Artista. Estes níveis de oferta foram criados especialmente para quem prefere comprar um trabalho decorativo já feito de que goste, ao invés de criar um painel com imagens suas. Ao mesmo tempo está a contribuir para o reconhecimento e o sucesso desse Artista. No futuro pretende-se que qualquer criativo que queira divulgar e vender o seu trabalho através de um painel INFINITE FRAME o possa fazer. Por agora pode ajudar estes Artistas e também conhecer melhor os seus trabalhos visitando os seus respetivos sites.

Por motivos de ordem prática apenas temos nas ofertas desta campanha molduras em preto. No entanto também iremos produzir nesta primeira fase molduras na cor cinza e brancas. Se quiser molduras em alguma destas cores, vá por favor ao site INFINITE FRAME, faça as suas escolhas e encomende tal com já explicamos anteriormente.

Nós gostaríamos de produzir mais cores ainda nesta primeira fase. Isso vai acontecer se recebermos mais dinheiro além do montante requerido na campanha.





Todos os materiais usados em INFINITE FRAME são recicláveis: Fibra de madeira (MDF) hidrófugo, plástico, acrílico e cartão.





Neste momento temos o produto afinado com a construção dos protótipos das molduras e do site INFINITE FRAME, que será o futuro site de vendas, e que tem como particularidade uma aplicação desenhada especificamente para este produto, que permite ensaiar e construir os painéis de molduras antes de os comprar.
O próximo passo é construir os moldes de injeção para produzir as peças de plástico que permitem conectar e desconectar as peças das molduras entre si e as peças de fixação do acrílico e cartão de fundo às molduras e as molduras à parede. Escolhemos e trabalhamos em parceria com uma empresa Portuguesa de renome Internacional especializada em produzir moldes de injeção. Em paralelo escolhemos e trabalhamos também com uma das melhores Carpintarias Portuguesas com tecnologia CNC (Computer Numeric Control – Comando Numérico Computorizado) para a produção das peças das molduras em MDF.
Trabalhamos também em regime de parceria com outras empresas de diferentes áreas empresariais como: fornecedores de serviços de Informática, Web Design e Marketing, Gestão e Contabilidade, de matéria-prima, de execução e transformação em produto acabado, até à logística e expedição de encomendas, para tornar o projeto INFINITE FRAME realidade.













Dependendo da dimensão, peso e local de entrega de cada encomenda, vão surgir diferentes valores de custo para entrega das mesmas. Quando estiver a fazer a sua encomenda selecione o seu País de entrega. Para as encomendas feitas através do site INFINITE FRAME o valor de custo de expedição é gerado automaticamente. Mas
IMPORTANTE: Se quiser poupar nos custos de envio também temos essa opção. Iremos estar em locais previamente anunciados em Lisboa e no Porto durante o período de entrega estimado (Outubro de 2016), onde pode ir buscar a sua encomenda e conhecer-nos pessoalmente. Para ter acesso a estas duas opções tem de fazer a sua encomenda através do site INFINITE FRAME.

Notas:1 - Se for residente em Portugal Insular faça por favor as suas encomendas através do site INFINITE FRAME, pois tem diferentes valores de expedição dos para Portugal Continental, para os diferentes níveis de ""ofertas"", que são os seguintes: (42.00€)+9.00€; (47.00€)+9.00€; (56.00€)+12.00€; (62.00€)+15.00€; (68.00€)+15.00€; (73.00€)+17.00€; (78.00€)+21.00€; (86,00€)+21.00€; (98.00€)+23.00€ e para os painéis de Artistas: (121.00€)+12.00€; (124.00€)+12.00€; (169.00€)+17.00€; (206.00€)+17.00€; (222.00€)+17.00€.
2 - Para alguns Países fora da União Europeia podem surgir taxas alfandegárias que não estão incluídas.3 - Se o seu País não se encontra nas nossas listas de Países para a expedição por favor envie-nos um email para info@infinite-frame.com  para verificarmos essa situação consigo.




Qualquer novo projeto acarreta os seus riscos, no entanto nós trabalhamos no sentido de minimizar todas as situações que possam gerar riscos, desde a fase produção até à entrega, e portanto acreditamos que elas não irão acontecer.
Também planeamos uma calendarização dos trabalhos com tempo suficiente para lidar com alguma situação inesperada sem comprometer os prazos de entrega. No entanto temos de admitir que mesmo assim poderão acontecer situações completamente inesperadas que possam atrasar um pouco o processo de produção. Nesse sentido iremos divulgando informação de acompanhamento do processo de produção para manter todos os envolvidos ao corrente do andamento da produção.





Esperamos que tenha gostado de INFINITE FRAME e queira fazer parte desta campanha para o tornar realidade. Mas, se por algum motivo não puder contribuir financeiramente para o projeto, a outra forma de ajudar é divulgar o link desta campanha nas suas redes sociais e junto daqueles que gosta e acha que também vão gostar de INFINITE FRAME. MUITO OBRIGADO!

Nesse sentido gostaria de deixar aqui um agradecimento muito caloroso e especial a todos eles, por esse apoio, paciência, disponibilidade e o acreditar na ideia, sem o qual nunca seria possível INFINITE FRAME ser o que é, aqui e agora.

COMO POSSO CRIAR O MEU PAINEL DE MOLDURAS?
Simples! Basta clicar no menu DIY da INFINITE FRAME (App disponível apenas para PCs e laptops presentemente), que tem na barra horizontal inferior todas as molduras disponíveis. Selecione e arraste para a área central do ecrã as molduras que quiser e junte-as para formar o seu painel. Clique dentro de cada moldura para fazer o upload das suas imagens e posicione-as. Crie a sua conta e faça a sua encomenda seguindo as opções. No acto de pagamento irá ser reencaminhado para este site onde deve fazer o pagamento da sua encomenda. Deve fazer o registo do pagamento  com o mesmo nome e email que utilizou para criar a conta no site INFINITE FRAME para nós sabermos qual é a sua encomenda e a expedir no tempo anunciado, em que a vai receber pronta para montar.


A MINHA ENCOMENDA NO SITE INFINITE FRAME É 39.50€. O INDIEGOGO NÃO ACEITA VALORES COM CÊNTIMOS, COMO FAÇO?
É verdade, o INDIEGOGO não aceita cêntimos. Quando essas situações acontecerem por favor faça o arredondamento para o número inteiro mais próximo. Pode seguir os seguintes exemplos de arredondamento: para 39.50€, arredonde para 40.00€; 44.50€ para 44.00€; 27.40€ para 27.00€ e 38.90€ para 39.00€.


OS PACKS 4+1 SÃO DE MOLDURAS IGUAIS, NÃO POSSO JUNTAR MOLDURAS DE DIFERENTES DIMENSÕES?
Sim, pode. Os packs 4+1 são de molduras iguais por uma questão de operacionalidade de venda para todos os tamanhos e rentabilização do produto para o consumidor, pois com a compra de quatro molduras e um conjunto adicional de peças extra pode construir painéis até cinco molduras, rentabilizando assim a sua compra. Para ter molduras de diferentes dimensões e poder junta-las tem de adquirir aqui os packs das molduras que quer ou ir ao site INFINITE FRAME e fazer as composições que quiser.


COMO SE FIXAM OS PAINÉIS À PAREDE?
As peças de fixação do acrílico, fotografia e do cartão de fundo às molduras têm na parte de trás uma ranhura para o encaixe da cabeça de um prego ou parafuso que estejam aplicados na parede. O número de pregos e pontos a aplicar na parede para pendurar os painéis devem ser vistos mediante cada configuração e dimensão de painel, pode só necessitar de um ponto ou muitos mais se for um painel grande.


SE COMPRAR UM PAINEL DE ARTISTA OU MESMO UM PAINEL FEITO POR MIM, POSSO DEPOIS MUDAR A CONFIGURAÇÃO?
Sim, pode. Qualquer painel pode ser montado e desmontado as vezes que se quiser e as suas configurações são infinitas, apenas dependem do número e dimensões das peças que tiver.


SÓ VEJO MOLDURAS A PRETO, NÃO TÊM NOUTRAS CORES?
Sim, também iremos produzir nesta primeira fase molduras a cinzento e a branco, mas para adquirir molduras nessas cores, terá de efetuar o seu pedido através do site INFINITE FRAME e fazer lá as suas escolhas e encomendas. Aqui na campanha do INDIEGOGO só estão expostas molduras a preto por razões operacionais. Se conseguirmos angariar mais dinheiro acima do valor pedido iremos progressivamente aumentar o número de cores a produzir.


O MEU PAÍS NÃO ESTÁ NA TABELA DE PAISES PARA EXPEDIÇÃO, COMO FAÇO?
Por favor envie-nos um email para info@infinite-frame.com para verificarmos essa situação consigo.


QUANDO VOU RECEBER A MINHA ENCOMENDA?
A data prevista de receção das encomendas é Outubro de 2016.


SE EU NÃO GOSTAR DO ARTIGO POSSO DEVOLVER?
Sim. Pode devolver o artigo num prazo máximo de 15 dias corridos após a sua receção, desde que o artigo esteja exatamente nas mesmas condições em que foi enviado, sendo os custos da expedição da devolução serão imputados ao cliente. Nas encomendas feitas através do site INFINITE FRAME em que foram solicitadas a impressão de fotos pessoais, os custos das mesmas não serão devolvidos.

<p>Recently I have been touched and affected by the stories of pain and loss of those who have lost loved ones to texting and driving.  The most devastating part of these stories is that these accidents didn't need to happen.  These lives did not need to be lost.  My goal is to make a dent in what is becoming a national &amp; really a global epidemic.  The technology is available to save our kids and to save these families from a lifetime of grief and loved ones lost.</p>
<p>I know that $125,000 is a lot to fund a project.  The money is being used to take this project from the current working prototype to the final manufacturing of the device.  My goal is to provide parents and family with the tools to make sure that their loved ones are driving without distractions and are safe on the road.</p>
<h1><strong>What is the Alive-to-Drive System?</strong></h1>
<p>The Alive-to-Drive System is a smart phone app (iOS and Android) and a device that when placed in an automobile will eliminate the many of the distractions that a smartphone may pose to a driver.  When a driver gets into a car with an Alive-to-Drive device inside the driver will not be bothered by incoming texts, emails, social media, internet and phone calls. As soon as the driver exits the car the phone automatically returns to full functionality.  Multiple smart phones can be linked to a single Alive-to-Drive device so that an entire family of drivers can be safe.  Rich administrator settings to allow for complete customization of the distractions that will be allowed while the phone &amp; device are in motion.   </p>
<p><strong>Car Passengers </strong></p>
<p>If there are two people in the car at the same time that are linked to the device.  The non driver just needs to push a button to gain full phone access.  This access is granted remotely by the administrator of the account or by entering a password on the phone if the administrator is personally there.</p>
<p><strong>Emergencies</strong> </p>
<p>Access to 911 and full phone access are only the push of a button away in case of an emergency - but the administrator will be notified.</p>
<p><strong>Battery Powered - No Installation Needed</strong></p>
<p>The Alive-to-Drive device is powered by a lithium ion battery and can be placed anywhere in a car, no installation needed.  The battery will last between 30 and 60 days based on usage.  When the battery gets low a text message will be sent to the admin to notify that the battery needs to be charged.  The device will use a standard USB cord for charging.</p>
<h1><strong>Why do you need the Alive-to-Drive System?</strong></h1>
<p>You are in the car driving and you hear that familiar tone.  You have a text message, email or Facebook update.  You know you shouldn't text and drive, but you reach for the phone anyway.  According to a recent survey you would be no different than over 75% of cell phone users who admit to texting while driving.  Texting and driving or distracted driving has been a growing concern for a number of years, lately the numbers of accidents have reached national epidemic proportions.  In 2007 Washington was the first state to pass a law banning texting while driving.</p>
<p><img alt=""US States Banning Texting &amp; Driving"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1283.photobucket.com/albums/a559/dsaxey/Slide8_zpsaf74302e.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""US States Banning Texting &amp; Driving""/></p>
<p>This year there are 36 states with laws banning texting and driving.  One would think this kind of growth in the number of states banning texting and driving would have a positive effect, however the data does not agree.  Every day 15 people are killed and over 1,200 are injured due to texting while driving.  Over a year the numbers are staggering: 5,000 dead, nearly 500,000 injured and over 1.2 million accidents annually just in the U.S.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Last year there were more people injured and killed by texting drivers than by people driving drunk.  </em></strong></h2>
<p>States can make laws, but will that really solve the problem.  Can a state law really make you ignore your phone when you hear the tone and know that someone is trying to reach you?  <em>Just this once it won’t make a difference, you tell yourself.</em>  Taylor Sauer probably told herself the same thing.  </p>
<h2><strong><em>Can this national epidemic be stopped?</em></strong></h2>
<h2>Yes, it can be stopped and the Alive-to-Drive System is the Key!  </h2>
<h2><em>Please Pledge and help the Alive-to-Drive System go into final production and become a reality.</em></h2>
