<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In February of 2012, an enterprising young comics fan named Hannah found herself wishing for a community where she could talk to other awesome women about shared nerdy loves.  Thus, Ladies' Night at Graham Cracker Comics was born!</p>
<p>A year later, and we are putting together an anthology that features original comics, art, and prose from more than twenty contributors.  Consider it a love letter to the city that brought us all together, and a coup for the independent creatives community that's growing all over the world.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make all this awesomeness happen, we need a some cash on hand to print the book and some amazing original artwork in the form of prints and buttons.  Your contribution to our $1000 goal will help us with:</p>

<li>Hundreds of buttons and prints to send to our campaign contributors and sell along with the book.</li>

<p>We all know that women and other minorities are grossly under-represented in mainstream comics.  The success of Womanthology last year proved that this doesn't need to be the case!  Whether you exclusively read superhero titles from the Big Two or you're an avid webcomic fan, every fan wants a place to feel like they belong, surrounded by other enthusiasts.  Our goal is to create an (ongoing) anthology that features the amazing talents of women who love comics in every form they come in, and the much-needed diversity that they have to offer to the industry.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Paper Dream Productions was started by Jay and Drew Sternitzky as a creative outlet to their work. Jay is a writer and Drew a painter, and they combined their creative urges into Paper Dream Productions' first project, SHORT-STACK: TALES OF A SUPER-HUMAN PLUMBER. </p>
<p>Jay has written as a hobby for years and this is his first foray into published/commercial work. Drew has been spotlighted in numerous art galleries across the country for his paintings.</p>
<p>So how did they end up here?</p>
<p>Jay had the kernel of the story hatched from a common egg he had shared with Drew, and after a brief attempt at telling a comic with someone other then Drew, threw up his arms in frustration and asked the one man who should have been doing the book all along - Drew.</p>
<p>And now, after years of effort (let's give it up to Drew for pencilling, inking and painting every page!), the first chapter in the story of Harry Trufont is ready for print!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation to help us get the first print run completed allows us expand our convention budget and advertise the book via print and web venues. And, unlike other crowd-sourcing sites, IndieGoGo gives us our donations whether we meet our goal or not - no matter what happens with the fundraising drive we still get the money that was already donated! Thank you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What do we want?</p>
<p>A little bit of help to get the book out in front others! The money donated goes directly to printing the first collected edition (Issues #1-4) of SHORT-STACK: TALES OF A SUPER-HUMAN PLUMBER for sale via the web and at conventions.</p>
<p>So, what do <i>you</i> get out of it? </p>
<p>Well, for starters, anyone who contributes will have their name published as a 'Thank-You' in the book - we really do appreciate all of the support we've gotten! </p>
<p>Vanity not enough? Well, then we have a deal for you...</p>
<p><b><i>DREW'S ORIGINAL HAND WATERCOLORED PAGES AVAILABLE FOR THE FIRST TIME!</i></b></p>
<p>That's right, Drew's original watercolored pages are now available for the 1st time - for only a $100 dollar donation! <i>AND</i> you don't just get the original art from Issue #1 or #2 of the book - you get a signed copy of the collection from Drew and Jay, the original issues signed, and a signed/numbered print of the collected edition cover.</p>
<p>And there's even more...</p>
<p>With eight donation levels, up to $200 there's something great for everyone who donates!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you love the idea, but can't help right now...?</p>
<p>     Forward this to anyone who might be interested!</p>
<p>If you've already donated and want to do more...!</p>
<p>     Forward this to anyone who might be interested! Let them know about SHORT-STACK and Paper Dream Productions...and most importantly...<br/></p>

Protetto da una famosa organizzazione, conduce esperimenti sugli esseri umani, alla ricerca della Verità: la chiave che porterà all’evoluzione.

Nonostante le continue lamentele da parte dei parenti, ad entrambe piace trasformarsi in esseri umani perchè lo trovano divertente e comodo. Tutte e due sono le candidate numero uno per succedere al posto di capofamiglia: riusciranno a rappacificare le acque tra i clan? SIRIO“Cacciatori di Demoni, Streghe, Stregoni, Pirati Spaziali, ne ho abbastanza! Sempre a complicare cose che potrebbero essere semplici! Vivere una vita normale vi è così difficile?” -cit.Apparentemente scontroso, ma dal cuore d’oro, Sirio lavora presso il Sushi-ya di Sakana-san come apprendista. Non sta mai con le mani in mano e passa il suo tempo libero ad aiutare gli abitanti del Borgo in difficoltà: è praticamente un tuttofare. Non mostra minimamente interesse per le mirabolanti avventure di Anima, anzi, il solo sentirne parlare lo irrita profondamente. Seppure sia abituato a convivere con il surreale, Sirio ama le cose semplici e trova che la vera felicità sia nell’ordinario, assieme alle persone care. È strano che una persona del genere si ritrovi al Borgo, non vi pare? Forse in lui si nasconde molto di più che un semplice apprendista cuoco. ​KIM“Provate anche solo a sfiorare la mia roba e vi troverete rivoltati dentro per fuori. Io vi ho avvertito.” -cit.Kim è una programmatrice e si occupa di gestire la struttura del Borgo, impedendo che il suo continuo mutare lo porti al collasso. È estremamente schietta e distaccata, ha una pazienza senza pari e riesce a mantenere la calma anche nelle situazioni più difficili. Possiede un repertorio di imprecazioni pressoché immenso che usa a pieno regime quando arriva al limite di sopportazione con determinate persone o quando gioca ai MMORPG. Abita assieme a Maman, Anima ed Hormon nella Prima Casa. La si può considerare il vice sindaco del Borgo. OBLAK & NEBE“Se voi seguiste le regole, il nostro intervento non sarebbe necessario.” -cit. OblakGemelle estremamente legate, Oblak e Nebe sono state cresciute ed istruite per diventare dei sicari di alto livello. Eseguono sempre ogni missione in modo perfetto, quasi fossero dei robot, e sono estremamente devote al loro superiore. Seppure agiscano sempre in sincrono, chi ha l’iniziativa tra le due è Oblak, che dimostra di avere il carattere che invece a Nebe sembra mancare del tutto. Ultimamente sono sulle tracce di Anima che gli ha procurato non pochi problemi, macchiando il loro curriculum perfetto. ALASTOR“L’equilibrio è alla base dell’esistenza, va preservato ad ogni costo e per questo importanti scelte devono essere fatte. Se non siete in grado di giudicare, allora io mi farò giudice per voi. Affidate a me le vostre vite.” -cit.Conosciuta come la “Strega di metallo” Alastor è un eterna guerriera, reputata da molti una semi divinità. Persegue il concetto di giustizia ed equità come nessun altro e non ha pietà per chiunque le sia d’intralcio; alcuni dicono che per il bene di questi ideali abbia gettato via il suo stesso cuore. Appartiene ad un’organizzazione che preserva e protegge la razza umana, ma, seppure riceva ordini, il suo giudizio sul campo di battaglia è del tutto imparziale. Agisce prevalentemente in solitaria, ma da qualche tempo ha un paio di apprendiste ai suoi comandi, le uniche che sono riuscite a sopravvivere al suo metodo disumano. TESLA“Ah. Ho rotto di nuovo Internet.” -citIndividuo molto ambiguo, Tesla è una tra le personalità più di spicco nella ricerca sul rapporto Demone/uomo e senza dubbio la più controversa. È stato accusato più volte di tradimento e diffamazione, ma i risultati delle sue ricerche sono così importanti da renderlo praticamente intoccabile. Protetto da una famosa organizzazione, conduce esperimenti sugli esseri umani, alla ricerca della Verità: la chiave che porterà all’evoluzione. Per quanto il suo operato potrebbe far trasparire l’opposto, Tesla ama incredibilmente gli esseri umani e passa molto del suo tempo a interagirvi su Internet: se per caso vi imbattete in grossi dibattiti e fenomeni virali, quasi sicuramente nell’occhio del ciclone c’è lui. Il progettoAnima affonda le radici estetiche in tutto quello scenario magico che spazia dal mondo dei videogiochi, Kingdom Hearts e Zelda in primis, al mondo dell’animazione: Evangelion, Kill la Kill, Gurren Lagann sono alcuni dei progetti più cari all’autrice. Lo stile tipicamente orientale e il gusto per la cultura del Sol Levante sono da sempre stati fonte d’ispirazione: nelle tavole respiriamo la delicatezza e il sapore del maestro Miyazaki ma anche forti rimandi a opere della Gainax come FLCL e Punta al Top 2! Diebuster. Molti stimoli anche da produzioni americane come Adventure Time e Steven Universe, dove elementi inverosimili e magia la fanno da padrone.Anima sarà un albo cartonato a colori, di 92 pagine in formato 21 x 29,7 cm. Un libro prodotto da Tatai Lab, ormai una garanzia di qualità nel mondo delle auto-produzioni targate Crowdfunding. Come useremo questi fondiAnima e' stato disegnato da Chiara e colorato da Lorenzo durante questi ultimi mesi, grazie al supporto del Tatai Lab Si tratta di 92 pagine ed e' tutto pronto, dobbiamo solo raccogliere i soldi per stampare e spedire. I fondi verranno usati nel seguente modo:€ 700 per le tasse e Indiegogo€ 5.000 per la stampa e i gadget€ 1.300 per la spedizione Come posso aiutare?Puoi aiutarci supportando il progetto o anche solamente condividendo la pagina Indiegogo sui diversi social network.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Do you Like Comics? Do you like music? So do we!</p>
<p>About this time last year some friends threw out the idea of doing a comic anthology all about music. A lot of our friends were into comics and had also been in bands or involved in music in some way and we wanted to bring our passions for both to a joint project.</p>
<p><strong>From that Bandthology was born!</strong></p>
<p>We launched a modest pledge drive and we were able to print and sell 300 copies of our 36 page debut!</p>
<p>This year we would like to have a bigger print run and have invited even more of our musical/artistic friends to join in!</p>
<p><strong>Bandthology 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Full color cover by Brian Churilla (DB Cooper)</strong></p>
<p><strong>40 interior black and white pages with contributions by;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pittman, Tony Maldonado, Greg Sorkin, Lauren Burke, Bobgar Ornelas, Wendi Freeman, Mat Nixon, Jon Westhoff, Matt Collander, Andrew Vanderbilt, Dan Dougherty, Don Cardenas</strong></p>
<p>Release date is February 2013</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong><a href=""mailto:Bandthology@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bandthology@gmail.com</a> with questions or retailer quotes</strong></em></p>

<div>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>What we need is money to print the book and help us pay for the cover art and shipping.</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of you reading this know, small press printing can be expensive. Some of our contirbuotrs are professional, but most are not. In all cases, there is no pay going to the contributors, but the more copies we can print, the more they can use to promote their art or sell at local shows.</p>
<p>All incentives are being donated by these dedicated contributors and no money from this fundraiser goes towards those items(ie CDs, shirts etc). A small amount will go to printing issues purchased of Bandthology 1.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>More about the book</h3>
<p>Like last years book, the great teams(and 2 new comers) are free to contribute any story they can think up from the world of music.</p>
<p>Last years book ranged from sci-fi to slice of life to kung-fu and beyond. This year will, no doubt, be even more expansive.</p>
<p>We invited people who are passionate about music and comics and our cover artists are no different.</p>
<p>Last year saw Ryan Kelly capture so much we have all felt playing shows and this year we asked artist/metal head Brian Churilla to share his love of both mediums.</p>
<p> </p>

Do you Like Comics? Do you like music? So do we!
About this time last year some friends threw out the idea of doing a comic anthology all about music. A lot of our friends were into comics and had also been in bands or involved in music in some way and we wanted to bring our passions for both to a joint project.
From that Bandthology was born!
We launched a modest pledge drive and we were able to print and sell 300 copies of our 36 page debut!
This year we would like to have a bigger print run and have invited even more of our musical/artistic friends to join in!
Bandthology 2
Full color cover by Brian Churilla (DB Cooper)
40 interior black and white pages with contributions by;
Aaron Pittman, Tony Maldonado, Greg Sorkin, Lauren Burke, Bobgar Ornelas, Wendi Freeman, Mat Nixon, Jon Westhoff, Matt Collander, Andrew Vanderbilt, Dan Dougherty, Don Cardenas
Release date is February 2013
 
Bandthology@gmail.com with questions or retailer quotes


Funding
What we need is money to print the book and help us pay for the cover art and shipping.
That's all.
I'm sure a lot of you reading this know, small press printing can be expensive. Some of our contirbuotrs are professional, but most are not. In all cases, there is no pay going to the contributors, but the more copies we can print, the more they can use to promote their art or sell at local shows.
All incentives are being donated by these dedicated contributors and no money from this fundraiser goes towards those items(ie CDs, shirts etc). A small amount will go to printing issues purchased of Bandthology 1.


More about the book
Like last years book, the great teams(and 2 new comers) are free to contribute any story they can think up from the world of music.
Last years book ranged from sci-fi to slice of life to kung-fu and beyond. This year will, no doubt, be even more expansive.
We invited people who are passionate about music and comics and our cover artists are no different.
Last year saw Ryan Kelly capture so much we have all felt playing shows and this year we asked artist/metal head Brian Churilla to share his love of both mediums.

<h3>Hi, My name is Mike S. Miller.</h3>
<p>I'm a 27 year veteran of the comic book industry, best known for my work on the Injustice Series for DC Comics, and Game of Thrones covers and prequel series based on Dunk and Egg. I've spent my career chasing deadlines, trying to do 'my best' with the time I was given. But now, with the advent of crowd funding, I've been able to take my time and do my BEST work EVER. </p>

<p>So what am I doing? I'm starting a universe. The Blacklist Universe. Heroes you can believe in! And the first hero is LONESTAR! A character I created years ago actually as a foil for a supervillain that could not be stopped, the evil IRON CROSS. WW2 Germany's Ubermensche!  Great heroes are defined by great villains, so the idea of taking my greatest villain and making a hero to fight him, instead of the other way around seemed inspired!  Of course, he is a patriot, fighting Nazis will do that, and the comparisons to Captain America aren't unfounded. They are both WW2 era fighting men given super powers. But that's where the comparison ends. Lonestar is drafted into a war against the dark creatures of the night as he becomes the founding member of the UNKNOWN SOLDIERS! Other 'fallen' soldiers who take up arms against the nightmares that haunt our world.  So I would say it's 'Captain America meets Van Helsing', with a heart. </p>
<p>The first campaign for Lonestar was HEART of the HERO on Indiegogo, and it did $113,000. And I am almost sold out of that book through my second campaign, Lonestar: Soul of the Soldier. So I decided to bring my second printing of Heart of the Hero back to Indiegogo with all new covers and a brand new 8-page origin story of BRANDO by upcoming superstar Matthew Weldon!!! </p>

</div></div>","RED XMAS: JINGLE HELL! is a 48-page, perfect-bound comic book concluding the series critics call: 

From ELF to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer to ""The Hanakkuh Song""... the holiday special is a staple of nearly all media.
We've set out to create one for comics. And with all the craziness going on in the world right now, we need a little Christmas. Right this very minute.
But unlike the Hallmark marathon, this Christmas tale ain't for kids. 
Here's the pitch:
""When Mrs. Claus dies in a tragic toy accident, Santa sets out to make all those little brats pay. Now, a Santa-skeptic FBI agent must team up with her wannabe-elf ex-husband to save their son--and Christmas!""

In addition to the super-sized 40-page main story, the book includes:

Exclusive bonus material
FREE U.S. SHIPPING!
Digital making-of material and theme song

 
Plus: catch up on the full series with our RED XMAS: TRIPLE PLAY.

When Mrs. Claus dies in a tragic toy accident...

Santa loses his s#!t on the town of Christmas, Vermont...

And while FBI agent Ellie Tewskberry tries--and fails--to bring him down...

Her son, Byron, runs away to the North Pole to find his dad, a wannabe elf who left the family years ago. Instead, Byron finds trouble:

Desperate to find her son, Ellie infiltrates A.S.S.--The American Santa Society--the national Union for Mall Santas. Soon, she finds herself fighting an age-old war alongside some... colorful allies.

But Santa escapes justice again. And just when all seems lost, Ellie's estranged husband re-appears... 

 
And now...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a child of the '90s raised on UFO conspiracy books and one-too-many episodes of <i>The X-Files, </i>the question I ended up raising in my late-twenties was perhaps inevitable: what would happen if the victims of alien abduction actually <i>fought back</i> against their extraterrestrial captors?</p>
<p>Couple that with visions of a roid-rage Arnold Schwarzenegger-clone beating the crap out of a bunch of pot-bellied, bobble-headed Greys and, well, the rest is history. </p>
<p><i>The Abductables </i>is that original idea finally brought to fruition--as both a tribute to my alien-obsessed youth and as a mission statement on how I want comics to be: funny, violent, dramatic, bombastic--with maybe a tear-jerking moment or two thrown in for good measure.  </p>
<p>Of course, bringing my ridiculous notions of intergalactic mayhem to life would be impossible without a draftsman who shares my irreverent sensibilities.</p>
<p>Enter: Ibai Canales (insert probe joke here)--an amazing artist who not only appreciates my sick sense of humor, but also produces the kind of expressionistic cartooning this project needs to land the jokes and sell the fights. And as you can see with these preview pages--Mr. Canales does so in spades! </p>
<p>By funding this project, you'll help bring the outlandish vision of two independent comic creators to life in physical form--and provide <i>yourself</i> with quality entertainment in the process! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551986482/oho5vni1ywtybzbewpev.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the good news: all the artwork for the book is ALREADY complete! This means a faster turnaround time for our backers!</p>
<p>The $5000 funding goal is calculated to cover the cost of ordering a healthy print run of the 52 page <i>Abductables </i>comic book, as well as quality shipping supplies, domestic &amp; (ridiculously expensive) international postage, bags &amp; boards, and any other ancillary fees that will no doubt pop up in the fulfillment stage of this campaign. </p>
<p>(We also need to set some money aside for Canales's beer fund--surely a worthy cause!)</p>
<p>The perks of this campaign are designed to give you <i>options</i>--some prefer their comics digital, others like to tear into a physical copy and devour it cover-to-cover, and others still are all about collecting (and possibly reselling!) their pristine first edition copy.</p>
<p>Whatever your preference, we've got you covered! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551986530/wwwhkfvvz6d6z8resk0e.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Both the medium and the industry of comic books are just a small satellite in comparison to the planetary behemoth that is pop culture at large. As such, independent creators such as myself and Canales have it especially rough when trying to bring our wacky ideas to life. Without corporate backing or the infrastructure of an established comic book company to do the heavy lifting, we need <i>your</i> help to print the book ourselves and send it directly to <i>you</i>, the reader! </p>
<p>While this is my first official crowdfunding campaign, Canales's track record speaks for itself, as his previous Indiegogo campaign <i>Iron Sights </i>(in collaboration with the great Richard C. Meyer, aka Ya Boi Zack) reached the vaunted Six Figures and managed to crack the Top 10 of that year's sales charts!</p>
<p>Because this is my first crowdfunding venture, I take my responsibility to provide you with a high quality book promptly and efficiently <i>very </i>seriously--after all, you only get one first impression! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551986584/xbq5yhbgxwcch9svm1hd.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Let's be frank: the worst case scenario is that we <i>don't </i>get funded. Should that happen, you'll be refunded your contribution and the book will unfortunately not see print.</p>
<p>Ah, but what if we <i>do </i>reach our goal? Well, that's when the <i>real </i>challenge begins! I'm not naïve: I've studied previous campaigns and have seen the trials and tribulations, mistakes and miscalculations made by other creators, and I owe them a great debt by learning from their mistakes.</p>
<p>While this process will certainly be a learning experience for me, I'm confident in my ability to roll with the punches and deliver the goods come hell or high water!</p>
<p>And while I intend to maintain complete transparency and accountability throughout the funding and fulfilment process, know this: once we reach our initial funding goal, you are GUARANTEED to get your book--no matter what!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Believe me, I know what it's like to be strapped for cash. If you simply can't afford to back the book--no worries! If money's tight and you still want to see this project succeed, do me a favor and help spread the word! </p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and any other newfangled social media the kids are into these days--let's make this campaign go VIRAL!</p>

<p>The heroes Grok and the Apostle John scour the globe and assembles a society of heroes to stop the anti-christ's premature ascension.<br/><br/>     Together they will assemble the greatest Superhero force the world has ever seen.  <br/>     ​They are   THE TRIBULATION TASKFORCE!</p>

THE TRIBULATION TASKFORCE
The Bible tells of a coming period of great turmoil, referred to by many as the End of Days.     ​     The soon to come antichrist is on a mission to bring forth the last days before the appointed time. Under a platform of world peace, he uses his position in the United Nations to assemble a team of Super powered warriors to help him achieve his true goal, the destruction of mankind.
The heroes Grok and the Apostle John scour the globe and assembles a society of heroes to stop the anti-christ's premature ascension.     Together they will assemble the greatest Superhero force the world has ever seen.       ​They are   THE TRIBULATION TASKFORCE!

featuring Norm's never-before-reprinted Whisper
stories along with many additional comic stories from  Norm Breyfogle and his award winning supporters
in the comics industry!On December 17, artist Norm Breyfogle was hospitalized due to a stroke. For many Batman fans, Norm Breyfogle
stands out as one of the top artists from the late 20th Century as the
penciller for Detective Comics from 1987 until 1993, as well as working
on the Batman series from 1990 to 1992.  Norm Breyfogle has most recently been
seen illustrating Trinity
of Sin: The Phantom Stranger and Batman Beyond, and the award-nominated Life With
Archie. Norm Breyfogle
 has suffered paralysis on his left
side, and he draws with his left hand. He now needs
months of extended care with daily therapy that will hopefully enable him to
once again continue his skillful art and regain his mobility to be able to walk, draw and hopefully work again.

Like many comic book artists before
him,  Norm Breyfogle is experiencing the brutal reality where freelance artists with marginal or no insurance can find themselves
crushed under hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical bills from career-altering illness or injury. Even in the
Affordable Care Act era, health-care security eludes many artists, including
ones with histories as extensive and reputable as  Norm Breyfogle. He needs help. You can help save him and get cool art for doing so.

<p>I am continuing to raise money to defend my trademark Sexy
Astrology, which was approved by the USPTO, last June 6<sup>th</sup>,
2014.  I am in the throws of a
small legal battle after being approved by the United States Patent and
Trademark Office.  A woman with a
dissimilar mark has being suing me, to stop the use of Sexy Astrology—the name
of my YouTube astrology show.  She
also sent me a cease and desist letter. 
We are nearing the end of the argument, and god willing she will
settle.  Namely I will most likely
write a statement saying:  “I will
not ever use my trade mark SEXY ASTROLOGY to do compatibility readings or
matchmaking between couples. And that SEXY ASTROLOGY is a straight astrology
show for entertainment purposes only.” 
It’s really a show about the astrological weather.</p>
<p>Last July when I began my first indiegogo campaign I
successfully raised about 1700.00$ in just 6 days. I was moving to Ithaca for
the year and was so happy for the turnout!  Thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p>I have been practicing doing monthly horoscopes for 7 years
through my youtube comedy channel called SEXY ASTROLOGY.  No, I do not think I am sexy, but in
the world of astrology the two words are easy to remember. And being that the
show is grounded in comedy, my then husband and I came up with the idea after I
had my 3rd child and the result was a small smash!  I have over 2 million video views and being that astrology
is a topic which many take way too seriously—or  people just don't believe in it at all—I  thought how can I sell my advice
better?  Make it SEXY, but the
bottom line is keeping it simple only offer one or two simple ideas &amp; keep
it funny so people keep coming back! 
I love helping people build self esteem &amp; trust in themselves all
while having a good laugh.  It's a
self-help show, with a bent on comedy and art...Astrology is one of those topics, that needs to be
televised...</p>
<p>The reason I am interested in keeping my Trade Mark is that
in the last yearsomeone else started using the term ""Sexy
Astrology"" with their column.I thought, ""oh no... guess I'll apply for a trade
mark.”  The United State
Patent andTrademark Office approved it as of June 6, 2014.  I am so excited! However I did not expect someone to file a notice of
Opposition, and Cease and Desist letter, turning this into a federal case.  With a little more support (2000.00$) I can
successfully defend my mark, my lawyer is doing an excellent job so far.  I have a strong case and over the
years, 400 pages of notes, from my monthly readings and a VERY different
product from the person who is trying to take it down.  Intellectual property is important to
all of us!  If I am able to secure
my trademark I will be able to continue to use the name Sexy Astrology for my
show, with out worrying if someone else will be capitalizing on my hard work.  And who knows? Possibly
obtain a slot on CNN, for a season or two, Ok Cable Access, maybe the History
Channel? O?  Bio?  As well I will be coming out with the
Sexy Astrology T shirt and if all goes well there will be the coffee cup and
tote!</p>
<p>So far I have spent about 5000.00$ obtaining and preparing
arguments to defend my mark. All of the funds are going to my Trade Mark
attorney in Los Angeles. 
Regardless of contributions I will still be providing Astrology (&amp;sometimes
SEXY) Videos.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and
thank you for your continued love and support.</p>
<p>Don't worry of course If you can't contribute keep coming

When AILSA DARK: Werewolves & Bampots reaches its initial target, I'll be able to start adding some cool stretch goals like these:
STRETCH GOAL 1: MINI-COMIC IN 3D!
This is a great stretch goal and everyone who buys physical copies of the comics gets it!
£2,000 Unlocks the Tattybogle Man mini-comic in 3D! This is a reprinting of my Tattybogle Man story from the out-of-print Tales of Mystery and Imagination #2. A blood drenched homage to Hammer Horror by way of The Wicker Man! 
And in the best b-movie tradition it's being remastered in 3D! Glasses will be provided!
A5: 5.8"" x 8.3""


Here's a 3D test... It shows the remastered artwork in Black & White and the initial 3D separations (before finalisation and polishing).

STRETCH GOAL 2: AILSA VS DRACULA ART PRINT
A stunning 8"" x 10"" full colour giclee art print on quality art stock.
£2,500 unlocks a signed Ailsa Dark vs Dracula gicglee print! This is a high quality 8"" x 10"" full colour giclee art print of original artwork that I'll create during the campaign if stretch goal 1 is achieved. You can follow me on social media and see how I create it!
 
STRETCH GOAL 3: MYSTERY COMIC?
£3,500 unlocks a complete 36 page Mystery Comic! 
Whatever could it be? One thing's for certain... it'll be a shocker!
UPDATE: How's this for a teaser?




Comics and prints will be packaged in rigid boxes (see below) and securely sealed with clear tape. I've calculated the costs for the P&P and have kept it as low as possible, while still offering the best possible service. Keep in mind that as the stretch goals get added to your perk, the P&P remains the same... that's what they call a bargain!



The remastered Issue 1 is in the bag and is ready to go to print!
Issue 2 has been written, the pencils have been  thumb-nailed, and it's now ready to be fully illustrated and coloured!
I've published comics and sold them successfully at UK comic cons for some years now. I've been hitting deadlines throughout my professional career and will make this one. Follow me on social media and you'll see all the updates and work in progress.
This is a passion project for me and I've got a whole new world to build and share with you... let's do this!


Help spread the word by sharing across social media!
Even if you can't contribute to the campaign, and I know how tight funds can be, you can still help by sharing and following me on social media. I hope that your interest has been piqued and that you'll give me and Ailsa Dark a chance to build and share this world.",36.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>""Crazed genius"" - A.L. Kennedy</h3>
<p>With a foreword by award-winning novelist and fellow Dundonian A.L. Kennedy, 'Striptease' is my latest collection of comic strips from Scotland's only pro-independence daily, The National.</p>
<p>Taking up where 'Greg Moodie's Election Dissection' left off, it charts the fall of Jim Murphy and the collapse of the Labour vote in Scotland; the plight of Alistair 'Fiery Pants' Carmichael; the rise of the Brexiteer buffoons who got their wish then shuffled off leaving the rest of us to deal with the consequences; and the ongoing saga of accidental leader Jeremy Corbyn presiding over a terminally divided Westminster opposition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Deadbeats Get In Return</h3>
<p>The book will be printed in Scotland by Bell &amp; Bain Ltd, who were previously responsible for 'Greg Moodie Versus The Union', 'Election Dissection', 'Welcome to Cairnstoon' and 'Borrowing Burns'. Funds of £7500 are needed to cover this cost, along with postage and sturdy packaging.</p>
<p>In return, you will receive a signed copy of 'Striptease', a 144-page full colour, A4 landscape book with a gloss laminated cover, matt coated art paper within and a cracking 1000-word foreword by A.L. Kennedy.</p>
<p>Additional perks include the hardback 'Borrowing Burns', my 'factually-dubious' account of the creation of the Tam O'Shanter Murals in Torphichen (""Hugely enjoyable"" - Alan Bissett), and signed Moodie prints.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Road To Independence</h3>
<p>The independence debate is STILL notably lacking in humour, and only the grassroots Yes camp has ever been able to instill it with any sense of colour or fun. I'm proud to count myself part of that group and I firmly believe not only that independence is inevitable, but also that these modest little toons are in their own peculiar way charting Scotland's road there. If you're interested in a satirical account of the obstacles a small country faced in its ongoing fight for independence, you'll need 'Striptease'.</p>

<h3>Slackers, Deviants &amp; The Unstable</h3>I know you mostly all fall into one of the categories above, but if you could take time off from your admittedly demanding loafing schedules and see your way to sharing this campaign as widely as possible, I might be able to continue with this cartooning business.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE STORY:</strong></p>
<p><em>Peter Pain</em> is a young adult novel that tells the story of Elizabeth Davies, a 16-year-old girl, who wakes up one day in an alternate dimension called the Never-World. This patchwork fairyland has been shaped by generations of children’s dreams, and their nightmares. With the help of Toade, a fae warrior, Beth sets out to find Peter, the only one on the island of dreams who can take her home.</p>
<p>This book isn't all about fairies.</p>
<p>During her journey Beth is stalked by ninja-pirates, kidnapped by the wild Lost Children, challenged by the jealous and deadly skin-walker Tigress Lily, and finally meets Peter, who doesn’t want her to leave the Never-World. EVER. Beth also discovers that she comes from an ancient bloodline that allows her to <em>manifest</em> her will and change the Never-World, just like Peter.</p>
<p>How will her new powers change her? Will Beth embrace her destiny as a child of angels? And how can she help lift Peter's curse so he will (maybe) let her go free?</p>
<p>This book is #1 in the 4-part Angel Dust series and just like the beloved Narnia series, it's got both fantasy and Christian elements. I've had the concept in my head since 2008 and finished the first draft in 2010. I finally started revising <em>Peter Pain</em> in June this year, and planned to use a huge chunk of each paycheck to pay my extremely talent artists and get the graphic novel going. Then I lost my job... darn economy.</p>
<p>Seeing how I'm not a horrible writer, I know I could find an editor to do a quick proofread for a good price and release an ebook for half the budget I'm proposing, but I envisioned bringing the Never-World to life by turning it into both an illustrated book and a graphic novel.</p>
<p><strong>I'm too stubborn to let that vision go. I wanted to independently publish this book under my own imprint, called Metis-Rise, as the first of many quality books for pre-teens and young adults.</strong></p>

<h3>THE BREAKDOWN:</h3>
<p>Money earned will go to covering fees, editing, development of the comic illustrations, and the incentives. Additional funds earned (beyond our goal) will be used towords finishing the graphic novel, working on the website, and towards a contribution to J.M. Barrie's beloved charity,the <strong>Great Ormond Street Hospital. </strong></p>
<p>If the demand and support is high enough, we'll reach some awesome stretch goals, and I'll start working on the Angel Dust Chronicles full time. If I don't reach my entire goal, the funds will go towards getting as much of the book illustrated as possible.</p>
<p>Art: The books are illustrated, and there is a digital graphic novel in the works. Though my artists are awesome, they can't afford to give away the art for free. How fair is that? I'm going to have roughly 20 pictures (one for each chapter) in the book. And 20 additional pages for the comic. That's pretty expensive. So my budget for art is roughly a third of the funds I'm raising.</p>
<p>Editing: I'm a freelance writer and I edit other people's books, so I understand the importance of getting a book proof-read before releasing it to the masses. I admit, I miss mistakes in my own writing all the time. Every writer does. So I'm budgeting for proofreading and a little copyediting for a 60,000 word book, about $3 for 200 pages.</p>
<p>Formatting: It isn't very expensive, but it's needed. I want to get <em>Peter Pain</em> properly formatted for different types of e-readers and print. It shouldn't cost more than a couple hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Indie Go-Go Swag: I'm putting aside $500 for t-shirts, posters, bookmarts, and more! I'm doing a limited print run of 6x9 B&amp;W illustrated novels for everyone who pledges $35 through $74. This costs about $6 per unit. The hardcover special editions will be ordered only for the people who pledge $75 and up.</p>
<p>Fees: Indiegogo and Paypal charges about 8% for their part in the fundraising. So when we raise $3500, they will get  about $300 of the balance right off the top.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3><strong>ART FOR YOUNG ADULTS:</strong></h3>
<p>In the early 1900's, authors like Lewis Carrol (Alice in Wonderland), Frank Baum (Wizard of Oz), C.S. Lewis (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) and J.M. Barrie (Peter Pan) released beautiful iconic books, full of black and white pictures along with the text and some color illustrations at the end of every chapter. With the popularity of books like <em>The Diary of a Wimpy Kid Series, </em>I realized pre-teens who read chapter books love seeing as well as reading. I decided to create a novel that has pictures for a slightly older age group. <em>It's a little like mixing a graphic novel and a book together. </em>I found a couple of wonderful artists who were willing to squeeze me into their schedules, and we did some concept art on what Peter, Beth, Lily, and the Lost Ones will look like. Marcus and Zach are willing to turn my story into a bunch of artistic images and a graphic novel, so we can build the Never-World visually.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>YOU CAN HELP:</h3>
<p>I have friends and family in New England that I wish I could help after Hurricane Sandy. With so much turmoil out there in the world... my team and I agreed that 30% of every penny raised over the $4000 goal should go towards a charity (net: after Indiegogo fees). </p>
<p>So we are going to contribute 30% towards GOSH in rememberance of the original Peter Pan story written by James Barrie. The hospitial was awesome enough to give me the green light on this project so I really wanted to give back. </p>
<p>I hope that you will support my project, because supporting Peter Pain also helps children in need.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>STRETCH GOALS:</h3>
<p>I’d really like to make sure the Never-World comes alive in terms of comics but this measly $3500 will only fund part of the illustration budget!</p>
<p>If the Angel Dust novel project is successful on Indiegogo and makes a $8,000 stretch goal, I’ll finish Volume #1 (50+ pages) of the digital Angel-Dust comic and turn it into a print graphic novel! Anyone who pledges $50 or more will be able to buy the book at ""cost"" from the online store. Which means, whatever it cost to print 'em will be the amount you shell-out. This way, I won't have to create a new Indiegogo project when it's time for the graphic novel to come to life!</p>
<p>If we make a stretch goal of $12,000 we will invest in web-design so we can release weekly comic updates along with character profiles, short stories, and more. As you can see, the current website isn't very fancy. (<a href=""http://www.peterpain.webs.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.peterpain.webs.com.</a>) I just slapped something online so I could say I have one and it's in desperate need of an overhaul. Making this goal will help us create a slamming website so Angel Dust stories can be presented online as an ongoing web-comic. I'm thinking to hire my good friends at Eclipse web-media in Atlanta. They promised to do an awesome job! (<a rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.eclipsewebmedia.com/</a><a href=""http://www.eclipsewebmedia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">)</a></p>
<p>If we make the unheard of amount of $20,000 dollars, not only will that fund the 2nd book, we will also be able to reserve a booth at DragonCon 2013 and feature a bunch of Angel Dust swag featuring Beth, Peter, Lil, and the whole gang! Me, Marcus, and Zach will be there, ready to shake everyone's hand. We will probably be selling books and prints you guys at Indiegogo have already had for a year! By this time, the 2nd installment of the novel series “Darling Girl” should be printed... so cross-your fingers guys. Lets make this goal happen!</p>
<p><br/>Thank you for your generosity and support!</p>

Editing: I'm a freelance writer and I edit other people's books, so I understand the importance of getting a book proof-read before releasing it to the masses. I admit, I miss mistakes in my own writing all the time. Every writer does. So I'm budgeting for proofreading and a little copyediting for a 60,000 word book, about $3 for 200 pages.
Formatting: It isn't very expensive, but it's needed. I want to get Peter Pain properly formatted for different types of e-readers and print. It shouldn't cost more than a couple hundred dollars.
Indie Go-Go Swag: I'm putting aside $500 for t-shirts, posters, bookmarts, and more! I'm doing a limited print run of 6x9 B&W illustrated novels for everyone who pledges $35 through $74. This costs about $6 per unit. The hardcover special editions will be ordered only for the people who pledge $75 and up.
Fees: Indiegogo and Paypal charges about 8% for their part in the fundraising. So when we raise $3500, they will get  about $300 of the balance right off the top.
 

ART FOR YOUNG ADULTS:
In the early 1900's, authors like Lewis Carrol (Alice in Wonderland), Frank Baum (Wizard of Oz), C.S. Lewis (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) and J.M. Barrie (Peter Pan) released beautiful iconic books, full of black and white pictures along with the text and some color illustrations at the end of every chapter. With the popularity of books like The Diary of a Wimpy Kid Series, I realized pre-teens who read chapter books love seeing as well as reading. I decided to create a novel that has pictures for a slightly older age group. It's a little like mixing a graphic novel and a book together. I found a couple of wonderful artists who were willing to squeeze me into their schedules, and we did some concept art on what Peter, Beth, Lily, and the Lost Ones will look like. Marcus and Zach are willing to turn my story into a bunch of artistic images and a graphic novel, so we can build the Never-World visually.
 

YOU CAN HELP:
I have friends and family in New England that I wish I could help after Hurricane Sandy. With so much turmoil out there in the world... my team and I agreed that 30% of every penny raised over the $4000 goal should go towards a charity (net: after Indiegogo fees). 
So we are going to contribute 30% towards GOSH in rememberance of the original Peter Pan story written by James Barrie. The hospitial was awesome enough to give me the green light on this project so I really wanted to give back. 
I hope that you will support my project, because supporting Peter Pain also helps children in need.
PLEASE SHARE this link and tell others about the book!
 

 
STRETCH GOALS:
I’d really like to make sure the Never-World comes alive in terms of comics but this measly $3500 will only fund part of the illustration budget!
If the Angel Dust novel project is successful on Indiegogo and makes a $8,000 stretch goal, I’ll finish Volume #1 (50+ pages) of the digital Angel-Dust comic and turn it into a print graphic novel! Anyone who pledges $50 or more will be able to buy the book at ""cost"" from the online store. Which means, whatever it cost to print 'em will be the amount you shell-out. This way, I won't have to create a new Indiegogo project when it's time for the graphic novel to come to life!
If we make a stretch goal of $12,000 we will invest in web-design so we can release weekly comic updates along with character profiles, short stories, and more. As you can see, the current website isn't very fancy. (www.peterpain.webs.com.) I just slapped something online so I could say I have one and it's in desperate need of an overhaul. Making this goal will help us create a slamming website so Angel Dust stories can be presented online as an ongoing web-comic. I'm thinking to hire my good friends at Eclipse web-media in Atlanta. They promised to do an awesome job! (http://www.eclipsewebmedia.com/)
If we make the unheard of amount of $20,000 dollars, not only will that fund the 2nd book, we will also be able to reserve a booth at DragonCon 2013 and feature a bunch of Angel Dust swag featuring Beth, Peter, Lil, and the whole gang! Me, Marcus, and Zach will be there, ready to shake everyone's hand. We will probably be selling books and prints you guys at Indiegogo have already had for a year! By this time, the 2nd installment of the novel series “Darling Girl” should be printed... so cross-your fingers guys. Lets make this goal happen!

""ILOE’s wicked Imperial Warlord, with his Storm Trooper
Androids, Generals and Covert Agents, destroyed life on all the planets in our
solar system except earth. 
Now earth is their next target. The salvation of all
humanity rests on the broad shoulders of C2 & PÓSSE: Inner-City Heroes."" 





The Characters
Clarence Collins II - nicknamed C2™(pronounced Cee-Squared) is an African-American and is the Posse’s
leader and resident scientist, utilizing his keen knowledge of mathematics, he
creates all the hip scientific hardware they use from recycled trash. He also
raps, loves Hip-Hop and R&B, plays piano and keyboards and produces the
group’s phat soundtrack. 
Spoony-Breeze™ is a Caucasian-American and is real cool
and real quick. His nose twitches when there’s danger. He plays drums, paints
and loves Jazz, Urban-Contemporary Music, basketball and golf. His jump-shots
are legendary in the neighborhood. 
 
Glow™ is an Asian-American who’s jovial and energetic with a
distinctively infectious laugh and a glowing personality. Though a little on
the chubby side, he is a physically superior athlete and martial arts expert who
loves to eat. He plays tenor saxophone, loves Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley
and Rock and Roll. 
 
Peppermint-T™ is a Latin-American and is the stylish
and sassy informational specialist that monitors the airwaves (audio/video) for
ILOE related disturbances. On the science tip, she’s a whiz and cracks computer
access codes with her special skills and hardware. She’s got a green-thumb,
plays guitar and sings love songs, but please don’t be fooled...she’s no wimp!
She’s got a powerful right cross and is not afraid to fight for the truth!








The Impact












The first book (premiere episode #4) in this series is
called: ""Caught in the Mix"" (20 pages in full color) ISBN:
978-1-934938-04-1, and was published in January 2009.  During book fairs, kids & teens were captivated by the art and the story. When teachers
got a good look at it, they immediately realized that this was really quite different than what they were use to seeing. This made them want to use it in the classroom. 
Creatively, we have invented a story and characters that achieve all of the same explosive action and adventure of traditional graphic novels, but without the gratuitous violence. We focus on substance and values -  because we know that everything is learning!

One teacher in particular purchased books for her school and now has become the official educational advisor for the C2 &
Posse series. She created a Guided Reading Lesson Plan (for Episode #4) for teachers and parents. So now, each episode will have a lesson plan companion to help
teachers and parents utilize C2 & Posse inside & outside of the classroom.
""The fact that teachers recognize C2 & Posse as a
tool to inspire their students is a dream come true for me and it motivates our team to do even more"".
""C2 & Posse encourages kids & teens to
read, but also reaches their hearts and captures their imaginations with contemporary themes & culture, bright colors and spectacular page layouts"".






With each episode the C2 & Posse characters realize
that when they develop & utilize their CODES4LIFE™ - it gives them the Super-Power to
compete with ILOE's alien powers.





The CODES4LIFE is a hip, new, creative and exciting way
for kids & teens to discover the importance of developing human values that
produce healthy minds and create great citizenship, while being entertained in
an action adventure graphic novel.        
 
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is $4,000. This covers a limited first printing of ""Ready or Not... Here we Come!"" and helps cover some of the cost of developing the artwork and its Guided Reading Lesson Plan.
This new book (Episode #5) is called: ""Ready or
Not... Here we Come!""(40 pages in full color) picks up where
Episode #4 Caught in the Mix! (the Premiere Issue) leaves off.

"".... Android robots of the evil empire are in hot pursuit. C2 &
Posse, now realizes that if they are caught – they will be eliminated!
Peppermint-T snatches what appears to be an alien computer chip. They discover a new clue that reshapes their view of reality like never before. A new CODES4LIFE is uncovered!"".

High Quality Books 
All of the C2 & Posse: Inner-City Heroes books are created
with the very best materials.

The suggested retail price of this collectable graphic novel book is $16.95"".

Hello, my name is Milton and I'm a computer engineer from Venezuela, South America, I also run the blog SuperheroesInColor on tumblr.  Even living in latinoamerica there's no doubt that the portrayal of Latinos in mainstream media outside our borders shape the way we see ourselves, so I started this blog last year to focus on the positive and empowering portrayals of the underrepresented. To quote Black Nerds problems:""Explaining to others why under represented people, need POSITIVE representation of themselves gets old fast. Real fast.""SuperheroesInColor is dedicated to racial and cultural diversity in comic books and related mediums (TV, film, games etc.).  SuperheroesInColor showcases people of color as heroes, fully-realized characters; we celebrate their often-overlooked adventures, creators and histories. We see the cultural differences in characters as opportunities to educate trough the comic medium.We regularly feature interesting reading material and fun facts about POC characters in genre culture, cosplay, independent creations and authors that are sorely unrepresented on many superhero blogs. Representation of the full spectrum of comics diversity is SuperheroesInColor 's main mission. [Watson And Holmes, New Paradigm Studios] Recently, SuperheroesInColor suffered the catastrophic loss of our PC- along with all the research and imagery we'd been archiving over the last 9 years. For now, we're working as best we can by borrowing tech whenever we have a chance but obviously that's not a true solution. Our future is in peril! WE need some superheroes!!!So here is your mission (should you choose to accept it!): Help restore SuperheroesInColor to it's former glory as a haven for under-represented champions- and, who knows, possible help boost us to greater heights!

[Independent publishers and authors I want to keep sharing ]


What We Need & What You Get
The money will go to:



Purchase new computer setup + the shipping fees.


External Hard Drive to keep regular backups (don't want that last experience again)


Hosting and domain (2 years), so I can have a separate more focused site alongside the current tumblr blog.


A blog theme


INDIEGOGO FEES + PAY PAL fees +credit card fees 

Perks rewards costs. 

If the campaign happen to go beyond the initial goal the next milestone would be a limited series of video posts focused on comic book characters and after that another series about authors and artists from the past and present.
The Perks

</h3>
<p>Thimphu Comics, the first comic studio in Bhutan, was founded in 2013 by artist Pema Tshering. Our maiden project ""GARPA: The Attendant"" is now ready for print, and we need your help to bring it to life. GARPA is an action packed comic, with themes of heroism, passion, love and loyalty. It is based on the Bhutanese legend of <i>Garba Lungi Khorlo</i>, or the attendant that ""ran like the wind."" </p>
<p>We have been working passionately on the comic for 1.5 years, fueled only by our love for comics and the vision to produce one of the first comics from Bhutan. Without financial support, we have reached this far, and now we need a little help from you to take the final step and go to print. Please help Garpa finish his mission. </p>

Thimphu Comics, the first comic studio in Bhutan, was founded in 2013 by artist Pema Tshering. Our maiden project ""GARPA: The Attendant"" is now ready for print, and we need your help to bring it to life. GARPA is an action packed comic, with themes of heroism, passion, love and loyalty. It is based on the Bhutanese legend of Garba Lungi Khorlo, or the attendant that ""ran like the wind."" 
We have been working passionately on the comic for 1.5 years, fueled only by our love for comics and the vision to produce one of the first comics from Bhutan. Without financial support, we have reached this far, and now we need a little help from you to take the final step and go to print. Please help Garpa finish his mission.

<h3>The Story - <em>Two Mistakes Two Many</em>
</h3>
<p>Have you ever had such a strange case of deja vu that you could swear that you were in another place, in another time?  If so, could it be possible to be an entirely different person?</p>
<p><em>Two Mistakes Two Many </em>is the story of a young man named Yatsurao Satoru, who, in trying to save his village under the threat of war, is forced to leave his home and search for the lost legacy of Keitaro Yoshitsune; the only man in all of history to accidentally relive the life of Buddha.</p>
<p>It's come to be that <em>Two Mistakes Two Many</em> has been regarded as a little less of a conventional graphic novel, and a little more a <strong>black and white film on paper</strong>.  So sit back and enjoy the show, with a warm cup of tea on a late Saturday night, folks.</p>
<h3>My Mission</h3>
<p>This is my first graphic novel, however, not it's debut.  I first released the book in August, 2012.  It's debut was a success, and I have only one copy left (the one for myself, that is).  With this campaign, I aim to <strong>reprint Book One</strong>, as well as <strong>debut Book Two</strong>, so that I can continue to share this story that I've written, destroyed, and rewritten many times over.  </p>
</div>
<div>

The Story - Two Mistakes Two Many

Have you ever had such a strange case of deja vu that you could swear that you were in another place, in another time?  If so, could it be possible to be an entirely different person?
Two Mistakes Two Many is the story of a young man named Yatsurao Satoru, who, in trying to save his village under the threat of war, is forced to leave his home and search for the lost legacy of Keitaro Yoshitsune; the only man in all of history to accidentally relive the life of Buddha.
It's come to be that Two Mistakes Two Many has been regarded as a little less of a conventional graphic novel, and a little more a black and white film on paper.  So sit back and enjoy the show, with a warm cup of tea on a late Saturday night, folks.
My Mission
This is my first graphic novel, however, not it's debut.  I first released the book in August, 2012.  It's debut was a success, and I have only one copy left (the one for myself, that is).  With this campaign, I aim to reprint Book One, as well as debut Book Two, so that I can continue to share this story that I've written, destroyed, and rewritten many times over.  


What's Good in the Hood?
All pledges will be used to cover printing and shipping costs for both Book One and Book Two. Check them out:

Naturally, I'd love to do it again so I've written some songs and I'm ready to go.  Only thing holding me back is resource. I can't beg, borrow and steal from my friends all over again so I've come to the crowd for help.  I need £1250 in order to shoot two music videos with a touch built in for contingency. Money will be used to fund lights, camera and as much action as I can muster. Oh, and if I don't make my goal you get your dough back.
So the songs.. We'll, I've got:

one about falling in love at a festival called Smelly Welly Boots


one about turning 30 called LIMP


one about polishing your trumpet called Real woman. We all know polishing your trumpet doesn't actually mean polishing your trumpet, right? 
 There are some pretty cool perks for you guys if you fancied getting involved, so if you thought my first effort was funny then please help out as much as you can so I can rerun the fun.Also don't forget to share this for me and really make some noise about my campaign.

<p>Hi, my name is Scott B Henderson and <i>The Chronicles of Era</i>  is the first three chapters in an epic fantasy graphic novel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Book I of <i>The Chronicles of Era: Whispers of Redemption</i> will introduce readers to a world where mankind made for himself a paradise fit for gods. Mankind lived in the City of Heaven for two thousand years before The Adversary destroyed paradise and returned humanity to a harsh and brutal world. The survivors rebuilt their civilization, but their history was reduced to myths and legends. Hundreds of years later, three youths—Seth, Sidrich and Caitleth—are caught between the struggles of a great empire and the scattered rural clans struggling to maintain their way of life. </p>

<h1><b>Era's History and Influences</b></h1>
<p><i>The Chronicles of Era </i>has a long history. In its infancy it was science fiction story—populated by cyborgs, Frankenstein genetic experiments and trans-dimensional priests—before transforming into its current form, a more mythic fantasy world that still retains elements of sci-fi adventure and bits of steampunk.  The world was heavily influenced by Frank Herbert's <i>Dune</i> , Tad William's <i>Memory, Sorrow, Thorn Trilogy</i> , Michael Moorcock's <i>Corum</i>, but also by the books of Daniel Quinn, anthropology and mythology.  It was a few more years before the story was refined to a point where I could say, ""This is it. For good or bad, this is the story that will be told.""</p>
<h1><b>My Background</b></h1>
<div>
<div>I've been drawing since childhood, and even at an early age I drew pictures to stories. In high school and university I met a few exceptional teachers who had a profound influence on me.  After receiving my bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Manitoba, I worked on digitally colouring comic books, working in custom framing and all the while continuing to experiment and refine my storytelling. To date, I've illustrated nine graphic novels for Canadian publishers and educators, including: <i><a href=""http://www.portageandmainpress.com/book_detail.cfm?biD=343"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">7 Generations: A Plains Cree Saga</a></i> (which was nominated for best illustrated book in the 2013 Manitoba Book Awards), <i><a href=""http://www.portageandmainpress.com/book_detail.cfm?biD=305"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sugar Falls</a></i> and three stories for <i></i><a href=""http://www.portageandmainpress.com/book_detail.cfm?biD=386"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tales from Big Spirit</a> and most recently <i><a href=""https://www.portageandmainpress.com/book_detail.cfm?biD=541"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Betty: The Helen Betty Osborne Story</a></i>.</div>

""I won't talk too much about the story here, on account that it's pretty epic and the story builds up a lot and leaves us with few answers - it's set against two very different religious cultures, some choosing to live and trade despite the uneasiness and difference between the people, others forcing their beliefs and fighting.

The true nature of what we are and what we can become, there is always a choice.Ari has always been different but after a series of unexplainable terrifying events she comes face to face with what she truly is.

Because -- trust me! -- it's never too late to get into comics. But then, ""Why another dystopian comic raging against the system?"" Because this is also a story about dreamscapes, forgotten forests, and the power of memory.</p><h3><strong>How I fell into the nerdy comics universe ...</strong></h3><p>While I wish I could tell you that I was one of those sweet, geeky kids, who was mail ordering floppy comics to read after school, I grew up in a small town in Bavaria where nerdy kids were into archaeology museums rather than comic worlds. <i>Marvel</i> and <i>DC</i> were foreign words to me until I moved to the United States, where I finally discovered the unique pleasure of reading comic books and graphic novels.</p><p>Long before I got into comics though, I've been making art. Those who know me have seen my drawings, lino cuts, and screen prints, and two or three close friends have even elected to ink their bodies with my art (yes, I design tattoos!). While all this has been going on quietly, as a sidekick (so to speak) to my academic career, I've never really put myself out there and claimed the identity of an ""artist.""</p><p>I first delved into comic books while still teaching at the university. Over the past three years in particular, reading and writing comics offered a wonderful respite as well as, at times, an inspiration for my teaching (like that one time when we read Joe Sacco's ""Palestine"" in my class on <i>Archaeologies of Colonialism</i>). Now, newly arrived in New York City and at a sort of crossroads in my life, I'm launching myself full force into the weird and wild world of comics.</p><h3><strong>How I make my comics ... and what I need to make them:</strong></h3><p>There are piles of paper stacked next to me as I'm typing this: loose pages, sketchbooks, note pads. Some sheets are crowded with tiny text boxes and the outlines of story ideas, while others carry rough thumbnails and dainty sketches of story panels. Comic production takes concentration and time, as well as supplies and tools, plus the money to buy them. While all my comics are entirely hand drawn, the finished comic gets scanned and digitized, and the final touches are made on the computer.</p><p>For this purpose, I use a computer that's on its last leg, and I keep purchasing more drawing pads, pens, pencils, ink, and other stray art supplies. As with so many other things in this world, art isn't exactly a cheap endeavor, which is why it often feels like a luxury to me. However, it should be treated as a communal luxury. Let comics be a pleasure to be shared with friends, comrades, companions, lovers, fans, and devotees. Maybe there are also others -- outsiders, strangers, aliens, and all the nerdy kids yearning to be truly cool -- who will come across this campaign and find something in it that resonates with them, something worth throwing a few dollars at in return for a compelling story. So, here’s to hope.</p><h3><strong>The $$$ side of the amazing world of comics ...</strong></h3><p>Now, after all this talk about stories and dreams, I need to get practical for a moment and bring this back to how self-publishing works, and how you can help me with it. So let me break this down in terms of what has to happen in order to move this comic to physical production. As of now, the comic is fully conceptualized, drawn, inked, scanned, and laid out, so it's ready to go to the press whenever you are!</p><p>Over the next 3-4 weeks, I will be raising the necessary funds to get this comic printed and distributed, so that you can hold an actual hard copy of it in your hands by late January or early February 2017. In short, here's what I'm asking for:</p><ul>
<li>ca. $400 to print 200 copies of the comic (and more on demand if extra money rolls in)</li>
<li>ca. $200 for shipping supplies (envelopes, card board, etc.) and mailing to get the comic + perks for backers out into the world</li>
<li>$150 to cover the hours a graphic designer spent on page layout + final design</li>
<li>ca. $150 for promotional materials, including 1-year rental of a P.O. box, for returns and responses</li>
<li>ca. $100 for art supplies for future comics, lino prints, etc.</li>
</ul><p>Makes a total of around $1000. While I think this is pretty straightforward, let me try to answer at least two questions that might come up as you're reading this:</p><p>First, what happens if I don't raise the necessary funds to realize this project? It's simple: If I raise enough to cover at least the printing costs, I will go ahead with the project anyways, though it'll be significantly more challenging. I might not be able to send hard copies to all backers, but you will still get your exclusive e-copy. I will also distribute the comic in local bookstores, so you can mail order physical copies from these distributors.</p><p>Second, what happens if I raise more funds than I’m asking for? That'd be amazing, of course, and the answer is even simpler: I'll be making more comics! I've several drafts of comics sitting at home, and more exciting ideas for stories that are still unfolding. Some future comics to look forward to include a narrative about politics in Turkey as well as a silent comic about love and a bonsai tree.</p><h3><strong>Because capitalism is not a love story ...</strong></h3><p>To be entirely honest: Pitching a call for a fundraising campaign is a little bit frightening, especially for a project of the heart. I know that a lot of other people, too, are struggling -- to make rent, to find a steady job, or to treat themselves to the occasional luxury (going to the movies, eating out, buying a comic). So I encourage you to give only what you can. Anything helps, and even the smallest donation will receive an electronic copy of the comic in return.</p><p>Still, if you really cannot contribute, but are intrigued by the possibilities of this project, that doesn't mean you can't help. Those of you on social media sites can easily spread the word with the click of a button. And if you're feeling more like an explorer, there's also a SQUIRREL PRESS <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/squirrelpress/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram page</a> where you can preview some of my work and, believe it or not, a <a href=""http://squirrelpress.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tumblr website</a> full of serious and not-so-serious little stories.</p><p>Let the sharing begin, because, as they say, sharing is caring.

 Pay for insurance?  Raise kids, make a house payment?</p><p>Secondly, most of the publishing houses that would hire or print freelance artists or independent creators folded in between the financial crises of 2001 and 2008.  That leaves the rest of us scrambling to either work for the conglomerates owned by Disney (Marvel Comics) or Time Warner (DC Comics) -- and neither of them are interested in anything that offers a critique of modern society,  genuine satire, or real adult content -- everything is aimed at overgrown adolescent tastes or pure entertainment.  No protest, no biting commentary: nothing, in fact, a comic book is capable of delivering in its unique combination of language and images.</p><p>Third, this leaves independents such as myself who do not do superhero fantasies or happy-ending sci fi to fend for ourselves and compete with these media behemoths.  Needless to say, our audiences are small.  Not because we are boring or cheezy or amateurish, but because we are small and because Diamond Distribution -- the monopoly that distributes comics and is in bed with the large companies -- locks out small entrepreneurs with something to say and share from distribution to direct sales comics shops: the main line of income for most creators.</p><p>Fourth, because of the cultural climate and its swing to the right over the past 30 years, many printers will not touch or distribute online material that is the least bit controversial: in language; nudity; content; message.  I'm not talking child porn, but simple art and adult notions.  Things that are perfectly acceptable in the artistic and literary world at large are somehow forbidden in the comics world for fear ""the children"" will get their hands on it.  As if a child couldn't read a Henry Miller or get their hands on Playboy (and have for decades with little negative consequence beyond the development of an interesting vocabulary).</p><p>We undergrounders scrape to publish small runs of comics we must peddle ourselves online, by driving them around to stores willing to take a few., and by lugging them to conventions.  The printers charge a great deal of money per book for short runs and our profit margins are miniscule; many of us make nothing whatsoever after spending what can be upwards of a hundred hours putting together a book by ourselves, doing the graphic design, lettering, coloring, art, and writing.</p><p>All for the privilege of free speech and bringing an audience a superior product or a different point of view.</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>So, what do I expect, a Free Ride?!  Artists are supposed to suffer, aren't they?</h3> <p>Suffering is inevitable and expected.  No one does anything worthwhile without paying for it in time and talent and paying their dues.  That's life and I'm not protesting reality here.</p><p>What I am asking for is this: Contributions so I can publish my comics and offer cheap printing for a circle of talented artists in the same shape I'm in -- not dilettantes who have not paid their dues or lack suffering, not kids straight out of college, not hacks.  Folks who need access to the press, and the only way you get freedom of the press without going broke or suffering the whims of a printer is to actually own the press.  Like Mark Twain, back in the day, who was doing essentially what we do, sans pictures.</p><p>I want my small company, Loser Comix Group, to expand slightly by buying a used CMYK printer capable of printing comics.  In return, I can print my own books affordably, on demand, and offer small run printing to a few other creators at highly affordable rates competitive with the online companies that presently control our output.  </p><p>As a civil libertarian, I will not exercise draconian editorial opposition to content.  No, I will not print child porn or gratuitous violence against women, for example, or hate speech.  But outside such bracketed material, I will print what the creators want to take responsibility for on their own, neither approving nor disapproving.   That should be the nature of a free printing press, I think, in a free society. Certainly it's what the second generation of the underground and alternative comics movement needs. </p><p>I have located a refurbished  Xerox DC 252-type machine the dealer is willing to sell for between $9,000 and $10,000.  The $9,500 I'm seeking would pay for the majority of the machine after Indiegogo takes its cut and I will raise the remaining money, including shipping and supplies, out of my own pocket by borrowing against my car, from a partner who has pledged a generous amount, and by selling some of my art and belongings.</p><p>In the end, I will train myself to run the press, fulfill orders in a timely manner, and split my time between making my own work and helping others spread their message and reach their artistic dreams.  Working a 14-18 hour day is no new thing for me and doing so to make this project an ongoing concern would be a pleasure for me.  Your money won't be wasted.</p><p><b>The Perks </b></p><p>The first 300 people donating $5.00 or more will receive a free copy of my Jack T.

Sir Winston Churchill I make underground comix and art as do many in my small creative community; I've been doing this since 1993 in good times and bad.  And while I'm not fighting the Nazis during the Blitz, in my own small way, my comics, in the words Woody Guthrie's guitar used to have painted on it, ""kills fascism.""My name's Richard Van Ingram and I'm an artist with a studio degree in printmaking and an MA in philosophy.  I taught ethics at the university level for four years; I worked in public mental health for ten.  For day jobs I've done everything from selling used books to tattooing, picture framing, and cooking.  Yes, I've scrubbed my share of toilets; I've worked in a nursing home with the dying.  I've taught young officers entering the military the difference between a moral decision and an expedient one -- and which they ought to choose and why.But at age 48, I've never made a living off my art, which is my desire -- and the deficit isn't because of poor quality (see my website and judge for yourself) but a combination of circumstances.First, the business model of the 2000s; One must show and give away one's work for free online in hopes people will buy a book or some swag.  Imagine a financial advisor or other worker in any other profession attempting to make a living by first giving away their their work and then hoping the recipient will show some financial appreciation for it.  Could you make a decent, even lower middle class life that way?  Pay for insurance?  Raise kids, make a house payment?Secondly, most of the publishing houses that would hire or print freelance artists or independent creators folded in between the financial crises of 2001 and 2008.  That leaves the rest of us scrambling to either work for the conglomerates owned by Disney (Marvel Comics) or Time Warner (DC Comics) -- and neither of them are interested in anything that offers a critique of modern society,  genuine satire, or real adult content -- everything is aimed at overgrown adolescent tastes or pure entertainment.  No protest, no biting commentary: nothing, in fact, a comic book is capable of delivering in its unique combination of language and images.Third, this leaves independents such as myself who do not do superhero fantasies or happy-ending sci fi to fend for ourselves and compete with these media behemoths.  Needless to say, our audiences are small.  Not because we are boring or cheezy or amateurish, but because we are small and because Diamond Distribution -- the monopoly that distributes comics and is in bed with the large companies -- locks out small entrepreneurs with something to say and share from distribution to direct sales comics shops: the main line of income for most creators.Fourth, because of the cultural climate and its swing to the right over the past 30 years, many printers will not touch or distribute online material that is the least bit controversial: in language; nudity; content; message.  I'm not talking child porn, but simple art and adult notions.  Things that are perfectly acceptable in the artistic and literary world at large are somehow forbidden in the comics world for fear ""the children"" will get their hands on it.  As if a child couldn't read a Henry Miller or get their hands on Playboy (and have for decades with little negative consequence beyond the development of an interesting vocabulary).We undergrounders scrape to publish small runs of comics we must peddle ourselves online, by driving them around to stores willing to take a few., and by lugging them to conventions.  The printers charge a great deal of money per book for short runs and our profit margins are miniscule; many of us make nothing whatsoever after spending what can be upwards of a hundred hours putting together a book by ourselves, doing the graphic design, lettering, coloring, art, and writing.All for the privilege of free speech and bringing an audience a superior product or a different point of view.   So, what do I expect, a Free Ride?!  Artists are supposed to suffer, aren't they? Suffering is inevitable and expected.  No one does anything worthwhile without paying for it in time and talent and paying their dues.  That's life and I'm not protesting reality here.What I am asking for is this: Contributions so I can publish my comics and offer cheap printing for a circle of talented artists in the same shape I'm in -- not dilettantes who have not paid their dues or lack suffering, not kids straight out of college, not hacks.  Folks who need access to the press, and the only way you get freedom of the press without going broke or suffering the whims of a printer is to actually own the press.  Like Mark Twain, back in the day, who was doing essentially what we do, sans pictures.I want my small company, Loser Comix Group, to expand slightly by buying a used CMYK printer capable of printing comics.  In return, I can print my own books affordably, on demand, and offer small run printing to a few other creators at highly affordable rates competitive with the online companies that presently control our output.  As a civil libertarian, I will not exercise draconian editorial opposition to content.  No, I will not print child porn or gratuitous violence against women, for example, or hate speech.  But outside such bracketed material, I will print what the creators want to take responsibility for on their own, neither approving nor disapproving.   That should be the nature of a free printing press, I think, in a free society. Certainly it's what the second generation of the underground and alternative comics movement needs. I have located a refurbished  Xerox DC 252-type machine the dealer is willing to sell for between $9,000 and $10,000.  The $9,500 I'm seeking would pay for the majority of the machine after Indiegogo takes its cut and I will raise the remaining money, including shipping and supplies, out of my own pocket by borrowing against my car, from a partner who has pledged a generous amount, and by selling some of my art and belongings.In the end, I will train myself to run the press, fulfill orders in a timely manner, and split my time between making my own work and helping others spread their message and reach their artistic dreams.  Working a 14-18 hour day is no new thing for me and doing so to make this project an ongoing concern would be a pleasure for me.  Your money won't be wasted.The Perks The first 300 people donating $5.00 or more will receive a free copy of my Jack T.

<p><strong>What Is Galaxion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Galaxion</strong> is a multi-part science fiction graphic novel. The story is told first on the web, with pages published weekly and then collected into print form. We’re ready to print the third volume and you can help us make that happen!</p>
<p><img alt=""comic panel showing the nautilus-shaped starship Galaxion"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://galaxioncomics.com/images/indiegogo/Panel-1.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>The graphic novel tells the story of the crew of the starship <em>Galaxion</em>, who are testing a new jump engine. They make the jump, but don’t end up where they expect. The story has adventure, humour, romance and mystery. It appeals to readers of all ages and fans of ensemble cast science fiction shows like Star Trek (although those who watched Star Blazers may notice some influence, too).</p>
<p>As Volume 3 begins, the crew has made their way to a planet that looks too much like Earth to be a coincidence, but is different enough so that they know they are somewhere else. On the surface of the planet they find the wreck of the <em>Hiawatha</em>, a previous ship that had attempted to make the jump years before. They also find two distinct bands of human-like natives: one attacks them, then the other takes them prisoner. The ground party has lost contact with those still on the ship. <img alt=""Panel from GALAXION Volume 3 showing Fusella and darvin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://galaxioncomics.com/images/indiegogo/Panel-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/></p>
<p>If you want to see what it’s like, you can check it out at the <a href=""http://galaxioncomics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Galaxion website</a>. We think that’ll convince you. But many readers agree, it reads even better in print form.</p>
<p>This year is something of an anniversary for <strong>Galaxion</strong>. It was 30 years ago this year that Tara and her friend Wendy first assembled the crew of the <em>Galaxion</em> and started telling their tales. It was 20 years ago, at the Chicago Comicon in 1993, that the comic was first printed (photocopied) and sold. Later in the 90s it graduated to full-size printed comic format and was properly distributed for several years. In  2006 a new, improved version was launched on the web, which we are collecting now.</p>
<p>Help us celebrate Galaxion’s 20<sup>th</sup> (or 30<sup>th</sup>!) birthday by contributing to the publication of this volume!</p>
<p><img alt=""Image from Galaxion Volume 3 showing Aria"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://galaxioncomics.com/images/indiegogo/Panel-6.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;""/></p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Image from Galaxion Volume 3 showing Vessa"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://galaxioncomics.com/images/indiegogo/Panel-5.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>We’re looking for $4,000. That will enable us to print and ship the graphic novels without going into debt. If we reach that, great! If we exceed that, even better! If we don’t reach it, we’ll still print the books and send the perks. But not only will we get less in total, we get less of what you contribute as Indiegogo takes a bigger cut. It will just mean a lot more scrimping for the family.</p>
<p>Don't worry about the currency. We take lots of different ones. Indiegogo/Paypal handles the conversion.</p>
<p>To help inspire you to getting us to our goal, we are going to add incentives as the campaign runs and we hit percentage targets. I’ll say a bit more about that below, in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p><br/>No matter what you donate, you are part of the <strong>Galaxion Volume 3</strong> publishing team. That said, we all love perks and you can see a range of them over to the side. I won’t repeat them all here, but I do want to highlight a few:<img alt=""Fusella Queen of Hearts playing card"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://galaxioncomics.com/images/indiegogo/FusellaQoH.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/></p>
<ul>
<li>$25 is an important level. That’s where you get the printed book (signed and personalized) as well as everything for the levels above.</li>
<li>$100 is for the art collectors (and game players). It gets you the original art for a Galaxion playing card. It takes the character sketch to a whole new level. There’s a limit of 54 of them, though (to allow for jokers). And, if we manage to get 52 takers, we’re committed to making them into real decks and we’ll send a deck along, too.</li>
<li>$250 is for the completists. There have been three different versions of Galaxion in print. This gets you all of them, as well as everything else we can lay our hands on that Tara published! (It also gets you an <em>Amy Unbounded</em> story from NYT bestselling and award-winning author Rachel Hartman (<em>Seraphina</em>)</li>
<li>$600 is for those who love to see themselves in print. Add yourself to the crew of the <em>Galaxion</em>!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In addition,</strong> we’ll be unlocking bonus perks to add to what you’re getting as we reach various milestones. Each time we reach a milestone, we’ll add it to the level and announce the next. To start off with, here’s the first:</p>

<strong>When we are 150% funded we will add a ""Galaxion: The Salmagundi Years"" digital book for everyone who has supported at least $10.</strong> As we say above, Galaxion got its as a comic start 20 years ago at the Chicago Comicon. Tara and her cousin Franz got together and produced a small photocopied comic called <em>Salmagundi</em>. It was a flip book with one side being <em>Galaxion</em> and the other side Franz's comic <em>Vagabond</em>. It ran for seven issues before Tara left to move to full-size professionally printed comics. I'll scan in the Galaxion stories from these issues so you can see how the comic got its start - and how far Tara has come! <strong>ACHIEVED!</strong>

<li>
<strong>When we are 175% funded we will have characters answer a question for everyone who has supported at least $50.</strong> As we've promised, all books will come signed and personalized.

Tara will sketch a small headshot of that character by the signature in Volume 3 and have him or her answer the question for you. <strong>ACHIEVED!</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>When we are 200% funded we will add a brand new GALAXION short story to the bundle for everyone who has supported at least $10.</strong> After Tara has completed all of the playing cards she has committed to drawing, she'll create the new GALAXION short story.

</div></div>","What Is Galaxion?
Galaxion is a multi-part science fiction graphic novel. The story is told first on the web, with pages published weekly and then collected into print form. We’re ready to print the third volume and you can help us make that happen!
The graphic novel tells the story of the crew of the starship Galaxion, who are testing a new jump engine. They make the jump, but don’t end up where they expect. The story has adventure, humour, romance and mystery. It appeals to readers of all ages and fans of ensemble cast science fiction shows like Star Trek (although those who watched Star Blazers may notice some influence, too).
As Volume 3 begins, the crew has made their way to a planet that looks too much like Earth to be a coincidence, but is different enough so that they know they are somewhere else. On the surface of the planet they find the wreck of the Hiawatha, a previous ship that had attempted to make the jump years before. They also find two distinct bands of human-like natives: one attacks them, then the other takes them prisoner. The ground party has lost contact with those still on the ship. 
If you want to see what it’s like, you can check it out at the Galaxion website. We think that’ll convince you. But many readers agree, it reads even better in print form.
This year is something of an anniversary for Galaxion. It was 30 years ago this year that Tara and her friend Wendy first assembled the crew of the Galaxion and started telling their tales. It was 20 years ago, at the Chicago Comicon in 1993, that the comic was first printed (photocopied) and sold. Later in the 90s it graduated to full-size printed comic format and was properly distributed for several years. In  2006 a new, improved version was launched on the web, which we are collecting now.
Help us celebrate Galaxion’s 20th (or 30th!) birthday by contributing to the publication of this volume!

What We Need 
We’re looking for $4,000. That will enable us to print and ship the graphic novels without going into debt. If we reach that, great! If we exceed that, even better! If we don’t reach it, we’ll still print the books and send the perks. But not only will we get less in total, we get less of what you contribute as Indiegogo takes a bigger cut. It will just mean a lot more scrimping for the family.
Don't worry about the currency. We take lots of different ones. Indiegogo/Paypal handles the conversion.
To help inspire you to getting us to our goal, we are going to add incentives as the campaign runs and we hit percentage targets. I’ll say a bit more about that below, in the next section.
What You Get
No matter what you donate, you are part of the Galaxion Volume 3 publishing team. That said, we all love perks and you can see a range of them over to the side. I won’t repeat them all here, but I do want to highlight a few:

$25 is an important level. That’s where you get the printed book (signed and personalized) as well as everything for the levels above.
$100 is for the art collectors (and game players). It gets you the original art for a Galaxion playing card. It takes the character sketch to a whole new level. There’s a limit of 54 of them, though (to allow for jokers). And, if we manage to get 52 takers, we’re committed to making them into real decks and we’ll send a deck along, too.
$250 is for the completists. There have been three different versions of Galaxion in print. This gets you all of them, as well as everything else we can lay our hands on that Tara published! (It also gets you an Amy Unbounded story from NYT bestselling and award-winning author Rachel Hartman (Seraphina)
$600 is for those who love to see themselves in print. Add yourself to the crew of the Galaxion!

In addition, we’ll be unlocking bonus perks to add to what you’re getting as we reach various milestones. Each time we reach a milestone, we’ll add it to the level and announce the next. To start off with, here’s the first:


When we are 50% funded, we’ll add e-books of volumes 1 and 2 for everyone who has supported at least $10. Instead of just getting volume 3, you get all of them. It should make it easier to catch up, if this campaign is your introduction to Galaxion. ACHIEVED!

How you know the book will ship
This isn’t our first time printing Galaxion. This is Volume 3. We’ve done this twice before (more if you count earlier versions) and we know what it takes. The comics are all done. The book is assembled. We have the quote from the printer. All we are waiting for is your contribution to lighten the load and help pay the bills.

$500 - to cover misc. show expenses (Santa suit, many gallons of egg nog, performers in elf costumes)
If we raise more than the needed $4,000, we will put the remainder towards the cost of recording our THIRD Black & White Cookies album/live show. 
If we don't reach our goal, we will still record the show, but we're probably going to have to use tape recorders from 1983 and record it in our parents' basement. (The show would only be available on cassette or 8-track.)  

Cool PerksCheck out the ""Perks"" page to see all the things we've offered-- ranging from an advance download with bonus content, all the way up to a BWC-hosted party, and we've even thrown in Billy D's prosthetic leg!*

*I still haven't asked Billy if that's OK. But I'm sure he's fine with it. 

  The Impact This is all about creating an experience for our fans... I mean Stalkers. The whole purpose of doing this show in a recording studio is so that (1) the sound quality is unparalleled; and (2) because we have a huge live room to work with, and professional equipment, we can mic the audience as well as the band, and bring you directly into our performance. 
Risks & Challenges
 This isn't brain surgery. We just want to make a killer album, and do it right. We know the cost, we know the right way to do this, and we've got a proven track record for pulling off a consistently amazing, high-level show (or so our fans, musical peers, and many club owners have told us). (Except for that one show in Bridgeport, but our lawyers say we can't talk about that.)
Other Ways You Can Help
 
If you live in NYC and want to be part of our street team, send us a message and let us know! If you can't make it to the show but you know someone who really, really should, please forward this to them. 
If you see Billy D. on the street, please feel free to buy him an iced coffee. He likes that. Extra milk and two Splenda.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

HER FUTURE IS SET. HER PRESENT IS A LIE.  Camille has been living in space for the last three years. She has no memory of how she got there, who she is, or life before she woke up. All she knows is this: Earth has been destroyed and she is one of fifty other survivors who are part of something only known as Project Genesis. Camille is burdened with so many questions. Only until she meets Aaron Striker does she realize that everything she has been told has been a lie. One question lingers between the two... WHO IS THE ENTITY? In this 100+ page Sci-fi graphic novel, you will follow Camille in her journey to find out who The Entity is, or what it is, and to uncover the memories of her past that are crucial to saving humanity.    The creators are not clueless on how to (a) run a comic campaign (b) make comics and (c) most importantly, DELIVER a comic.

<h3>Sullivan's Sluggers Indiegogo Campaign to Adjust for International Shipping</h3>
<p>My name is Mark Smith.  I did Sullivan's Sluggers on Kickstarter and underestimated the costs of international shipping asking backers for just $10 a book.</p>
<p>The book grew in size/uprgrades to an omnibus edition and the costs of shipping (3.5 lbs) jumped up a lot with the extra weight.  International shipping prices from the USPS skyrocketed this year as well.  </p>
<p>I  didn't freight directly from China to the UK, EU, and AU which would have saved a lot of time and money and now I have to freight the books from California to these destinations.  All of these factors added up to a huge price jump.  </p>
<p>I need to raise more funds to get the book to international backers.  That's where you come in.  </p>
<p>I'm doing this Indiegogo campaign to raise the difference by offering the book to US backers so that I don't have to ask international backers for more and so that I can ship out the books to international backers at the original price of just $10 added for shipping.  </p>
<p>Each US order gets the book out to an international backer because the books are printed and there are no extra costs other than shipping and handling in the US.</p>
<p>I'll also be printing Sullivan's Sluggers stickers for international orders and possibly a few other extra goodies. </p>
<p>My goal is to wrap up the original Kickstarter in the next two months, get this book behind me, and move on to new projects that are better planned.</p>
<p>I'm offering Sullivan's Sluggers for a month for US BACKERS who missed out the first time for a chance to get their own glorious <em><strong>200 page Deluxe Omnibus Sized Hardcover </strong></em>(3.5 lbs) with a thick quality slipcase cover, a print in the inside front cover, a baseball card sheet in the inside back cover, dangling bound in ribbon bookmark, and a three page fold out monster gate fold. </p>
<p>All books come shrink-wrapped.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I used another campaign as a template that said to add $10 per book for international and since then rates have skyrocketed.  I also didn't ship straight from the printer in China to the UK, Europe, and Australia, making costs go up even more.</p>
<p>I'm doing this Indiegogo campaign to raise the difference by offering the book to US backers so that I don't have to ask international backers for more.  Each US order gets the book out to international backers.  </p>

The independent comics community is bristling with new energy but a good portion of the work coming from larger publishers doesn’t seem to be reflecting that vibrancy.<br/>To that end, we’ve decided that now is the time to launch our humble enterprise (unintended pun) in hopes that we can provide some of the craftsmanship &amp; magic that we remember so fondly with our comics, games and animation.</p>

<p>Omen is about a black-hearted &amp; disconnected man named, Frank Wade. The ultimate soldier turned ultimate sinner. Frank is a ruthless, cold-blooded, notoriously viscous man &amp; soldier, dies on a mission. But, by way of a technicality in Heavenly law, involving the ultimate sacrifice, Frank gets a shot at redemption if he joins Sha-Khor &amp; wears the Omen Armor. But his road will be long &amp; hard - not just in outward struggles as he fights Cain, Lilith, the Seven Deadly Sins &amp; the Lords of Hell, but internally as he struggles to confront his Dark past &amp; carve out a better future.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>First of all, THANK YOU very much for taking the time to look at our page. Omen #1 is the first of 5 titles within the shared multiverse called Omenverse. Several pros &amp; amateurs alike have both reviewed and praised the script for Omen #1. The most common response has been, ""That was awesome! A well planned story."" By contributing you are fulfilling the lifelong dreams of myself and my team - 1 of which, the artist/colorist/letterer, will make his American debut with this title (From Chile: Marco Cantillana ""Hex 666"" writer/artist). Not to mention getting some great characters as well as an original and entertaining story out into the indie world.</p>

<p>The first hurdle in creating the Omenverse comics is paying artist/colorist/letterer Marco Cantillana for production of Omen #1 - which has already started (Marco is drawing/coloring/lettering the script RIGHT NOW! &amp; the Cover &amp; logo are completed).</p>
<p>The next hurdle has already been conquered: getting digital platforms to sell my comics - I have arranged to sell them on Amazon, Comixology &amp; Comichause &amp; we will have our own web comic page as well on ComicFury.</p>
<p>A bit about my journey here: I have wanted to make comics since I was 12 years old (1988) and I have been developing my writing and production skills through the decades including majoring in Creative Writing in college, creating comic stories and characters and even writing a fantasy novel - which has become a world in the Omen Comics multiverse. I have pursued this vocation my whole life and I have no intention of ever stopping until I am dead. I want nothing more than to write &amp; create comics.</p>

<h1>About the Series</h1>
<p>The <b><i>Hard to Swallow</i></b> anthology series was launched with a simple premise: that erotic comics should be great stories as well as being sexy. The series ran from 2006 to 2009 and featured everything from werewolves and skater ghosts to pirates and porn stars.</p>

<p>The authors drew inspiration from punk, tattoo art, indie comics, gei manga, and confessional memoir to create a strong new voice in gay erotica. They brought in guest cartoonists with each issue—BiL Sherman, Drub, Steve MacIsaac, and Brad Rader—who created their own idiosyncratic erotic tales.</p>

</p><p>To take a rough draft story that is over 235,000 words long,
polish it, and transform it into a webcomic.</p>
<p>The comic follows protagonist Zayg, a member of an alien
race bent on universal conquest. When Zayg is discovered and taken into custody
by the US Government, he is granted an unusual second chance when they place
him with a human family. A chance to integrate into human society and prove he
is not a danger. With the threat of being turned over to Midnight’s Cradle—an
infamous alien research facility—hanging over his head, Zayg must watch his
every move, and keep the Other in his mind as quiet as possible.</p>
<p></p> <br/><p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>We are HanaChild. Hana is the artist, Child is the writer.
Child came up with the original storyline, and Hana contacted her about the
possibility of doing a webcomic. Both have been working to give the original
story a more detailed and intriguing mythos, together developing a whole
culture for the alien species. </p>
<p><b>Where is it/will it be?</b></p>
<p>Once funded, we will begin work immediately. The plan is, the posts will go:</p><ol>
<li>First to Patreon, where our patrons there will get to see the comic pages 2-3 days earlier</li>

<p><b>Why this project?</b></p>
<p>This project is already mostly set. The rough draft has been
written, and only needs refining and artistry to bring it to full realization.</p>
<p><b>What do we need?</b></p>
<p>The base comic will be traditionally hand-drawn with

<p><i>The never-before-seen prologue to the Resilience Saga.</i></p>
<p>  He came
to himself, confused and disoriented as usual, but something was different this
time. His arms stretched out to either side, held in place by taut chains, his
ankles locked so close together he could barely keep his balance. His tail
swung free, but the end had been wrapped tightly in metallic mesh. His head
bowed and posture stooped, as if he’d been standing this way for days. His
wrists ached, dried blood on his sleeves. Had he been struggling?</p>
<p> 
Exhaustion burned in every cell, and he could feel bruising as he weaved
slightly. A disembodied voice droned a question.</p>
<p>  “Are you
machine, or organic?” It was dull, and disinterested, as if it had asked a
hundred times before.</p>
<p>  His ears
twitched slightly, as he croaked, “Organic.”</p>
<p>  There was
a brief pause, a whisper of, “It’s talking,” and a scuffling sound. “Your back
is made of metal and machinery.” The voice had come alive again with interest.
“What about that?”</p>
<p>  “We’re
all inset with our Bymai at hatching.” He winced. <b><em>That was too much
information.</em></b> He longed for a chair or a stool, something to sit on. How
long had he been standing? How long had they been asking him questions? It must
have happened again. Had it been the shock of being captured?</p>
<p>  “What
does it do?”</p>
<p>  “I can’t
tell you that.” He snapped, eyes narrow. Who knew what they would use against
him?</p>
<p>  “If you
don’t tell us or give us a method of controlling whatever may come out of it,”
the voice warned, “We’ll have to go in blind and figure it out ourselves.”</p>
<p>  That was
not an option. Gritting his teeth, he growled, “It contains weaponry, medical
abilities, tools, and life support. Now you answer me. Who are you? Where am
I?”</p>
<p>  “Your
name?” The question came back as if he hadn’t spoken.</p>
<p>  “Who are <em>you?</em>”
He had been chained to face a wall with a darkly tinted mirror. He could see
five pulsing red forms through the mirror with his sekset eyes, even as his
pryset eyes took in his own battered reflection.</p>
<p>  “Your
name.” The voice insisted.</p>
<p>  “Not
until I am answered!” He roared. Instantly electricity jolted through the
chains. His tail lashed as his feet raked claws across the concrete.</p>
<p>  “Your
name.” The voice stated once more.</p>
<p>  “Zayg.”
He gasped, hanging from the chains limply.</p>
<p>  “Well,
Zayg, you are currently in the custody of the United States Government. It’s
fortunate you came around, tomorrow is your trial.”</p>
<p>  “Trial?”
His visions swam, blurring his reflected image with red pulsing figures.</p>
<p>  “Yes.
You’re obviously not from this planet, so you are either a refugee, a scout, or
a hostile, and as you have been rather uncooperative up until now, it’s not
looking good for you. There’s still time, so I suggest you cooperate. We may be
able to place you in a better situation than the one currently being
considered.”</p>
<p>  “What’s
that?”</p>
<p> 
“Midnight’s Cradle.”</p>
<p>  Zayg
sucked in a breath, fragments of Zee’s taunts in his head about the
organization and the knives and scalpels they kept sharp just for freaks like
him. The tiny cages. The cruel experiments.</p>
<p>  “I see
you’ve heard of it. Ezequiel Florez is more than a little delighted to be
proven right for once.”</p>
<p>  Zayg’s
ears flattened against his skull. He could feel his Seilun pulse with fear. He
could not go to that place.<i> <b><i><em>You owe the Agarvo nothing</em></i></b>, </i>the Other

is my favorite show, hockey is my favorite sport, is it any wonder that comics
is where I choose to devote my energy?  I
originally started out  campaigning  for Wonder Woman then Gal Godot swooped in and
hijacked that!  Well well I thought I’ll
just redirect…..Wonder Woman’s archnemesis, <b>CHEETAH! BOOM</b> now I can take her
down its perfect!  I saw some Sizzle
Reels courtesy of YouTube and<b> BA</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>M</b> now I got plan! (Oh, for those of you who
don’t know, because I didn’t … a sizzle reel is simply a trailer for a movie I
imagine myself cast in) Ok this seems pretty ambitious right? It’s not. My job
is to create, my job is take the next right action and let go of the results.
</span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ACTION ACTION ACTION.</b></p>
<p>That being said, I was taught by some pretty incredible
mentors to live in the space of my hearts desire.  I figured since I want to play some pretty
tough chics…I better learn how to be a pretty tough chic. That meant I had to
intensify everything: my diet, my workout. 
I came upon Chris Moran at <b>JKD NYC</b> . This wasn’t too difficult to find
since his school is named one of the top 5 Martial Arts schools in NYC.  <b>AMAZING!!</b> 
Naturally, I started training . I trained everyday because my intention
was to get good fast; casting is in session!!!! Well Chris said “I need to slow
my roll here”… ok got it. So, I was patient and I trained, and eventually I
started getting pretty good.  </p>
<p>Now it was time to start <b>Sizzle Reel </b>action plan!  My dear friend Josh wrote a script. Chris
Moran did the entire choreography. I had a costume made by another talented
friend, so this is great! off to a good start! 
Several months, and thousands of dollars later, this baby was looking
good! Got the SWAT guys (the JKD staff) who trained and worked endlessly with me, costume
fittings galore, and practice makeup sessions so this can be the best it can
be.  I got my camera crew ready, and, not
only is their work amazing, they are professional stuntmen! </p>
<p>Now for the really fun part! We film on a rooftop, in New
York City, JKD’S to be exact; its an incredible location. We use the fire escape
for a knife sequence and inside the studio for some interaction with Cheetah
and the Joker!</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">16 hours later we finished.  I had cuts, scrapes, bruises, I was bleeding,
cold and tired. Fight sequences are no joke and I’d do it all again in a
heartbeat. To feel that joy of doing what I love and being surrounded by supportive
like-minded people was a gift and something I think every person should be able
to experience.</span><br/></p>
<p>This project is a milestone for me. For awhile it felt as
though <i>I’m a bartender who wants to act,</i> now because of this experience, <i>I’m
an actress who has to tend bar. </i>I moved into a new <i>space</i> with this project.  It’s a tool that is only going to help further
my career ambitions.  Everything so far
has been paid out of pocket.While we have finished filming, it is still incomplete due to editing.  But, this
is where you come in. I need some help. I have a stubborn streak of “I
can do this on my own” <b>lets get real here I did none of this on my own!</b> If it
wasn’t for this amazing group of people I have had the good fortune to work
with, this project would never have seen the light. </p>
<p>The money donated will go towards the camera crew, equipment and editing, the costumes, hair and makeup, and oh yeah the<b> COSTUMES!</b>  It seems a small list here but trust me it is
no easy fete. A portion of the proceeds

<h3>ABSOLUTE UNIVERSE #1's</h3>
<p>Along came a spider, and changed everything!</p>
<p>WHITE WIDOW is the recent new #1 comic and through the support of many, has been very well received.  However, it's just the start of an inter-connected, shared universe line of comics from ABSOLUTE COMICS GROUP.</p>
<p>We wanted to launch this campaign to give those who may have missed the exclusive WHITE WIDOW #1 issues a chance to get in on the ground floor, as well as introduce everyone to 8 other titles that are coming out that connect to the line as a whole!</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>These books are already at the printer, and so the funding from this campaign will be used to help with some of the shipping costs, as well as help us to continue moving the line forward by paying for creative and development costs. </p>
<p>As you can see, we use top-tier artists and creators to make some amazing comics!  But we need your help to continue moving ahead.  You're literally helping us build and maintain an entire universe.  That's a lot of power in your hands... and as they say with great power...</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>In an effort to try to make this as simple as possible, we've broken the comics into a variety of ""Tier Groups.""  The covers you see in each group will correspond to the PERK LEVELS from your pledge. </p>

<h3>The Score</h3>
<p>It's important to note that while White Widow was ordered well by retailers, the numbers for the other books did not fare as well in the comic shops...  So, unless you pre-ordered these titles, this may be the only way for you to receive them.</p>
<p>Also it pays to remember that we already ordered the printing of these books, so quantities are extremely limited... especially on the higher tier covers.  We firmly believe that with the success of White Widow, and how intricately connected she is to these titles... they will fast become collectors issues.  This may be your absolute best way to get in on the ground floor!</p>

<h3>Why we need the money...</h3>
</div>

<p>I'm Art Thibert, and back in 1994 while working at Extreme Studios, I was given the opportunity to publish my very first independent comic through Image.  My wife, Pamela, and I wrote Black &amp; White as a three-issue mini-series which sold over 500,000 copies.  Since then, readers have constantly asked me when this duo would make their triumphant return to print.  </p>
<p>Black and White - Remastered is the original story which has been re-crafted with new updated story, additional pages, remastered artwork and colors.  My  new co-writer, Taylor Grosso, and I have updated the storyline and script. My wife, Pamela, is on board as Editor-in-Chief; together we have brought this project into the 21st century.</p>
<p>With the help of  you, the Indiegogo backers, Black and White will be given new life and a chance to return to the reader's hands as a two part epic adventure.  The readers have spoken, and we have listened!  Because I'm taking a step out of the mainstream industry, I hope you will support the Black and White team with the first of many independent projects we have planned for you.</p>

<h2>Sometimes Dead is Better...</h2>
<p>When Otis resorts to making moonshine, he makes a grave mistake that costs him his life. Seeing Otis’ lifeless body, the now widowed Mary tries to bring him back using ancient magic. But not everything is as it seems, and dark forces gather in the shadows. Love, sadness, death and the macabre await you within the pages of Otis Stein!</p>
<ul>
<li>Full color cover front and back with B&amp;W story interiors by Carlos F. Rodriguez make up this 36 page book.</li>
<li>The book is <strong>100% complete</strong> and <strong>ready for print</strong>.</li>
<li>Written and created by indie writer, Matthew Vealey with art by Carlos F. Rodriguez, this book isn’t like anything you’ve seen on the indie comics market. </li>
</ul>
<p>This book is loosely based on a flash fiction feature Matthew wrote within the pages of Ashcan Comics Publishing’s Old School Monsters. He has always had a deep love and an appreciation for all horror. Otis Stein is his love letter to the genre. From subtle references in every page to horror classics of the past, to new ideas he brings alongside them, this book is sure to be one hell of a ride for those looking for a unique and bloodcurdling experience.</p>
<p>With the talent of Carlos F. Rodriguez on Pencils, Inks and Colors, this is sure to be an eye catching book. Carlos is a talented graphic artist with dreams of working in comics. His contoured art style really complements the tone and atmosphere for the story. With artwork that takes a life of it's own and seems to flow over the page, creating something truly unique. Otis is the love child of passion and teamwork from both writing and art.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The book is <strong>complete</strong>, but we need your help to get it to print!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need roughly $500 to print this book.</li>
<li>We are also offering an 18”x24” poster printed with black light reactive ink shipped in a tube mailer at additional costs. This is definitely an eye catcher and a great decoration.</li>
<li>Full color art print of the original illustration of Otis by Bruce Patnaude.</li>
<li>1.5"" hard enamel pin of the Otis Stein logo. Very cool and snazzy.</li>
<li>Own a page from the book by Carlos F. Rodriguez (Limit of 24)</li>
</ul>
<h3> Our Goal</h3>
<p>By supporting this book, you are helping two indie creators make their dreams a reality and we hope to bring you much more of Otis with your help. Here are a few things your support will help us accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Create</strong> more great stories with Otis, including epic crossovers with fellow indie creators.</li>
<li>
<strong>Provide</strong> politics free entertainment, no soapboxes or propaganda here. The drapes here are just blue and that’s the way we like it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rise</strong> up to offer solid entertainment in a waning industry that has lost focus on what really matters: entertainment and escapism.</li>
<li>
<strong>Build</strong> and establish our own comic universe, filled to the brim with new characters and stories to tell. Now's the best time to get in on the ground floor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>No Risk &amp; Only One Challenge</h3>
<p>We wouldn't ask for you to invest in us unless we have done it ourselves. We've already poured our time and resources into making this book a reality, but now we need your support to take it further.</p>
<ul>
<li>The book is complete, we just need your help covering print costs as well as try to make our own investment back in this project.</li>

</div></div>","Sometimes Dead is Better...
When Otis resorts to making moonshine, he makes a grave mistake that costs him his life. Seeing Otis’ lifeless body, the now widowed Mary tries to bring him back using ancient magic. But not everything is as it seems, and dark forces gather in the shadows. Love, sadness, death and the macabre await you within the pages of Otis Stein!

Full color cover front and back with B&W story interiors by Carlos F. Rodriguez make up this 36 page book.
The book is 100% complete and ready for print.
Written and created by indie writer, Matthew Vealey with art by Carlos F. Rodriguez, this book isn’t like anything you’ve seen on the indie comics market. 

This book is loosely based on a flash fiction feature Matthew wrote within the pages of Ashcan Comics Publishing’s Old School Monsters. He has always had a deep love and an appreciation for all horror. Otis Stein is his love letter to the genre. From subtle references in every page to horror classics of the past, to new ideas he brings alongside them, this book is sure to be one hell of a ride for those looking for a unique and bloodcurdling experience.
With the talent of Carlos F. Rodriguez on Pencils, Inks and Colors, this is sure to be an eye catching book. Carlos is a talented graphic artist with dreams of working in comics. His contoured art style really complements the tone and atmosphere for the story. With artwork that takes a life of it's own and seems to flow over the page, creating something truly unique. Otis is the love child of passion and teamwork from both writing and art.
What We Need & What You Get
The book is complete, but we need your help to get it to print!

We need roughly $500 to print this book.
We are also offering an 18”x24” poster printed with black light reactive ink shipped in a tube mailer at additional costs. This is definitely an eye catcher and a great decoration.
Full color art print of the original illustration of Otis by Bruce Patnaude.
1.5"" hard enamel pin of the Otis Stein logo. Very cool and snazzy.
Own a page from the book by Carlos F. Rodriguez (Limit of 24)

 Our Goal
By supporting this book, you are helping two indie creators make their dreams a reality and we hope to bring you much more of Otis with your help. Here are a few things your support will help us accomplish:


Create more great stories with Otis, including epic crossovers with fellow indie creators.

Provide politics free entertainment, no soapboxes or propaganda here. The drapes here are just blue and that’s the way we like it.

Rise up to offer solid entertainment in a waning industry that has lost focus on what really matters: entertainment and escapism.

Build and establish our own comic universe, filled to the brim with new characters and stories to tell. Now's the best time to get in on the ground floor.

No Risk & Only One Challenge
We wouldn't ask for you to invest in us unless we have done it ourselves. We've already poured our time and resources into making this book a reality, but now we need your support to take it further.

The book is complete, we just need your help covering print costs as well as try to make our own investment back in this project.
No waiting years for the book you helped make happen. As soon as the check clears, the print files will be sent and we start fulfillment.

<h3>Why Me? Oh Woe. (Who am I and Why am I here?)<br/>
</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, I graduated college despite homelessness and giant squids drowning innocent ships in China. With my new bachelor's degree in anthropology, I got a job as a bill collector in a 99% turn around environment. 90 days later I returned to my life as a comic guru through a webcomic called Akashik and a newly-formed team called the <a href=""http://www.apocalypsewriters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Writers of the Apocalypse</a>. And I haven't looked back.</p>
<h3>No, really. Why am I here?</h3>10 Confessions &amp; A Kiss follows one girl, Zoe, who gets into a bit of trouble when she ""accidentally"" gets cursed to find her one true love. She has 365 days to do so, or she dies. (Da da da dum!)  <br/><br/>Her obstacle is she was an awkward girl in high school, so she's never dated. Not once. She's spunky, but boy-shy. And she has no one she even likes, much less could feel love for. If you don't think this could bring trouble, think again. It's one thing to have made your mistakes in high school when the hormones are flying off the handle. When you're in college and have no social clue in the world? You don't even know where to begin!<br/><br/>This is meant to be a limited series with about 15 chapters, give or take. My goal is to keep the story down to three graphic novels, at any rate.

<h3>Which means I'm here because ...</h3>Right now my goal with 10 is to assemble the first five chapters into a chapter book. Or, manga book if you prefer.  The first step in this is for me to revisit chapter 1, ink it, tone it, improve some of the artwork, and basically give it the polished feel I wanted it to have when I began this venture. Then I will return to chapter 2, on to chapter 3, and so on.<br/><br/>Each chapter will be available for Kindle and Nook by themselves. Chapter 1 is currently available this way, but I warn you: I'm revamping it and I will be changing things soon. I also might change my mind about this part and take them completely down, leaving only the chapter books available.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, I want to produce a limited print run of the each chapter book - maybe 500 or so - with a unique cover that will be only available through 10's website and at conventions.  All other editions gotten through WotA's distributor will have a different cover, etc. Kind of like the Darkwing Duck Comic-con only edition that I'd love to have for my very own.

And that means that the 4th Volume is on its way!
But I need your help.
That's where Indiegogo comes in.
With your help I can get ""Imy"" Vol 4.0 printed in time for NYCC this year, and maybe even make it possible for me to attend more cons in the future.
""Imy Vol. 4.0"" will be printed in full, vibrant color, it will contain strips #301-#405, an extra exclusive story about what would happy if Imy went to Mars, and some more fun extras!

Bret's failure to grasp the industry he's plunging into turns an exciting challenge into an unending nightmare for Sally.

The Bret Braddock Adventures is kind of like a police procedural where a TV production gets murdered. Slowly.

It's about working in TV (and is based somewhat on ""life experience"" in the animation industry), but hopefully it's entertaining to anybody who's ever had a lousy boss or three.




Preorder Volume 2!

There's already been one book of Bret's adventures, which collected episodes 1-42. This second book completes the heartrending story, collecting episodes 43-96.

I'm hoping enough people want to order their copy of Volume 2 (and Volume 1, too, if they don't already have it) that I can get the $650 I need to print the book. If we don't quite make it to $650, I'll cover the rest myself. Either way, everybody gets their order.


Your Choices

1. I have Volume 1 and want to order Volume 2.
Ten dollars will take care of that. One hand-numbered copy of The Bret Braddock Adventures, Vol. 2, sent right to you before anybody else gets theirs.

2. I want both volumes 1 & 2.
Fifteen dollars is all that's required. The whole terrible saga, whacked into the post and ready for bathroom enjoyment in mere days.

3. I want everything I can get.
Then shoot me fifty dollars, greedyguts. You will receive:


The Bret Braddock Adventures Vol. 1.
The Bret Braddock Adventures Vol. 2.
A nice one-off giclee print of your preferred episode (any of 1 thru 76, as seen at docklandsentertainment.com).

A piece of hand-drawn Bret Braddock art on an authentic 350gsm non-archival cardboard beer mat.

Oh, and I'll list all of you pre-orderers in Vol. 2 so everybody who reads it will know what good taste you have.


Got No Money?

Then shoot this link to anybody you know who likes comics and has ten dollars!

And you'll be able to read the entire story at docklandsentertainment.com later in the year. Most of it is there already!

T-shirt Designs:   I'm Matt Boatright-Simon, the writer and star of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter (Half) Brother.  A little over a decade ago I had the amazing privilege of co-creating and performing at the Edinburgh Fringe. The show was a smashing success, garnering numerous four star reviews, incredible sold-out audiences, the highest honors and awards, and multiple touring opportunities. The experience that changed my life. It expanded my mind and heart and made me want to share that experience with everyone I know.  The Edinburgh Fringe Festival  produces over 60,000 performances from great artists, actors, dancers, stand-up comedians from around the world is something to behold.So that formative experience simmered in me for over a decade and then I had a revelation -- return to Edinburgh with an original and uproarious Sherlock Holmes Legacy play! ""Sherlock Holmes' Smarter (Half) Brother"" is a loving send up to the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved character.It's a hilarious, brash, and edgy comedy that has both big laughs and incredible heart.While we have a great play, we need financial ($$) help marketing it in Edinburgh so we can fill seats.Launching a show at the Edinburgh Fringe is phase one for  Brotha Holmes. In addition to touring, we're going to shoot a pilot for a series, but none of that can happen unless we get a great start. Your lovely contributions will help make people think, laugh and feel a little bit better about this crazy world in which we currently live.Update:

<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>Dendrolagus is a comics anthology focusing on narrative and experimentation. This 80 page first issue features a dreamy post apocalyptic botanical journey, a surreal dream house showing, different ways to deal with experiences from a demonstration, and more. Mixing the familiar with the unknown, the unreal and the too real, Dendrolagus wants to create something new in the in-between. Everyday surrealism and serious absurdity. It is based in Malmö, Sweden featuring Sweden based artists but produced in English.</p>
<h3>WHY?</h3>
<p>Dendrolagus loves these types of comics, and if your taking the time to read this you probably do too. They're not very market friendly tho, which is why an anthology like this is needed, and why crowdfunding is perfect for it. There's no one publishing my favourite comics and so coming from a culture of DIY I decided to start doing it myself. Someone's got to. Both for the artists' sake and the readers. There needs to exist an anthology like this.</p>
<h3>WHO?</h3>
<p>Editor and publisher of Dendrolagus is me, Steve Nyberg, a Swedish comic artist most known for Trygga lilla Sverige (""Safe little Sweden"", Galago 2016), a collection of comics based on actual terrorist acts and horrible mass murders thru 20th century Sweden where I followed the perpetrators' every day life up until their gruesome deeds. I've also made lots of zines and love going to zine fests where you find all the great comics that flies under the radar of the mainstream. In the first issue of Dendrolagus I've gathered some of my favourite comics artists and thru an open call also found some really exciting new talent:</p>
<p><i>Amalie Götz<br/>Jonatan Rosén<br/>Ylva Oknelid<br/>Hanna Lundin Tistelö<br/>Emma-Lisa Henriksson<br/>Rakel Stammer</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493293849/akroxrrft99azvx2o5z1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>
<h3>HOW?</h3>
<p>Your donations will cover the expenses of printing and paying the artists. The anthology is already half way on it's way to the printer's and will be released by the end of May. Your financial backing would give us a stable ground to continue from, minimising the financial risk and improving the possibilities for publishing more issues in the future. So if we raise even more than the set goal, we can raise the artists' pay and start producing more issues sooner.</p>
<p>And in exchange you can get pins, screen prints, or just a great big thanks!</p>

<p><i>(I made more versions of pins than first promised when setting up the perks so just write a comment about which one you want when putting down your pledge (Dendrolagus closeup / Treetops / Dendrolagus full body), or I'll get back to you about that.)</i></p>
<h3>HELP!</h3>
<p>Like I said, publishing comics outside the mainstream is not something you do to get rich. But we're doing it to promote interesting comics art. I hope you're interested in that too. Any help is much appreciated. If you've got limited assets but want to help Dendrolagus get made, there are other ways to do that. For example by telling your friends. Or, with the help of your social networks you can tell your acquaintances and the whole world by sharing this campaign and increase the chances of someone with money to spend finding out about it.</p>

<h3>So what's going on?</h3>
<p>Newshounds is my baby, and it's leaving the nest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the less sentimental, it's a comic that I've poured twenty years of love on, fifteen of which the world has witnessed as a webcomic at <a href=""http://www.newshounds.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.newshounds.com</a>.  And now it's coming to an end.  This project determines whether it comes to a screeching halt unfinished or whether it glides to a smooth, perfect landing the way I'd intended.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why am I doing this?  The outside world is starting to cave in a little.  Family issues are becoming more pressing to the point where I have very little free time anymore to finish this project.  Being a caregiver can be very stressful.  On top of it all, I'm having to balance two separate jobs in order to pay the rent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why do you need this?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In two months I move down to the San Francisco Bay Area to take a potentially exciting new job that's very, very part time... at least for a while.  This gives me a brief window of time where I can either temp to make up the shortfall, or I can achieve my final dream of finishing a 20-year -long work of art in a way that accomplishes my creative and philosophical goals.  Newshounds fans everywhere would be happy, and I would be happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the amount I'm asking for allows me the time to get over the hump and get this book completed.  The final chapter of an extensive saga, rich with action and character development.  To see it in progress, visit the Newshounds website linked to above. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So what do I get if I contribute?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have five tiers of donations, each of which has a commission level attached... full comic pages all the way down to pencil sketches.  Plus, in 2014, you will get a rebate of 1/3 your contribution.  After the book is completed, I'm going to spend all of the last third of 2013 and all of 2014 finishing commissions in the order they were received.  I've done commissions before and you can see them at <a href=""http://www.furaffinity.net/user/tkdye"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.furaffinity.net/user/tkdye</a>.  If you're not into commissions, write me and let's talk. I'm sure I can do something cool for you in return.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I don't have any money, but I'd like to help!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you!  And you can!  It's very simple; if you have a Facebook or Twitter account, spread the word!  Anyone who posts on either form of social media will get a FREE quickie pencil sketch -- immediately!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Plus, there are all these Indiegogo share tools that you can use.  This place is awesome, so I encourage using it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is something that's very important to me and to the people who have followed Newshounds from day one.  It's the difference between the comic just stopping with a notice saying ""I apologize, this is the end because real life has taken over,"" or ending with the big finish it was intended to end with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who can help!  You're going to make a big difference.</p>

<p><strong>Who am I and What is My Comic?</strong></p>
<p>Everybody has something that they’re passionate about. Me? I love the art of comics. My name’s Michael Watson, and I’ve always known I wanted to draw comic books. After being turned away from my dream company, because my drawings were too “urban” for their liking, I decided to make my own story, where my style fit perfectly.</p>
<p>Ideas brewed and plans were formed starting in 1999, and the first issue of Hotshot was born in 2009. I wanted it to have aspects of everything I admired in my favorite comic books; mixed with the world I created myself. In that world, I wanted to showcase characters that looked like actual people; all shapes, sizes and colors. When you read Hotshot, or any other Freestyle Komics works, you’ll realize these are characters you will find yourself relating to and believing in, because they look like you and me.</p>

</div></div>","Who am I and What is My Comic?
Everybody has something that they’re passionate about. Me? I love the art of comics. My name’s Michael Watson, and I’ve always known I wanted to draw comic books. After being turned away from my dream company, because my drawings were too “urban” for their liking, I decided to make my own story, where my style fit perfectly.
Ideas brewed and plans were formed starting in 1999, and the first issue of Hotshot was born in 2009. I wanted it to have aspects of everything I admired in my favorite comic books; mixed with the world I created myself. In that world, I wanted to showcase characters that looked like actual people; all shapes, sizes and colors. When you read Hotshot, or any other Freestyle Komics works, you’ll realize these are characters you will find yourself relating to and believing in, because they look like you and me.
Because I’m self-employed, I need your help. This campaign will help me print as many copies as I can and spread them around Ohio and the rest of the United States. I feel that kids, and other comic book fans, should see a variety in their hero. Not just the standard superman, but someone different. From the way they look, how they talk and how they handle real life situations; not one that is limited to the extravagant “save the world” scenarios. My passion has been to show kids that you don’t have to be 6 feet tall with chiseled abs to save the day. Anybody, any color, any shape, any size, boy or girl, can be a hero. This campaign will help enormously, and is something I’m relying on to get my book out there.

I will be championing and supporting the efforts of The Kidney Foundation of Canada, The Kidney March, and World Kidney Day, through my comic strip and GIVING BACK the vast amount of profits from memberships, comic strip collections, and merchandise. This is my cause. This is what my comic strip will Remedy.


GOOD NEWS...POP Remedy DOES NOT exist just for me and my cause. There are other artists, with other causes looking to DO GOOD. We know you are out there - we are here - waiting

The 1st Comic Strip: The first comic strip appearing under POP Remedy Syndicate is MY comic strip, 'The Pursuit of Mandy'

'The Pursuit of Mandy' is about a little girl, Mandy, and her three imagined friends, Parry, Sam and Fenton. Together and totally unbound, they experience the extraordinary wonder of childhood to its fullest, escaping the clutches of time and remind us, panel-by-panel, that it's never too late to go back. “Adults are just obsolete children and the hell with them.” ― Dr. Seuss







""Touching and tender, crazy and delightful, sweet, silly, poignant, and sad. I think you captured that childhood imaginative streak beautifully... you're in a class with Bill Watterson and the top strips of Jef Mallett."" - FAN


How will the Syndicate &
Comics Generate Money?:
The syndicate and comic strips will generate revenue for selected causes through Donation buttons, Web advertising, Selling original art, limited edition prints, Merchandising, book collections, Getting into print and other cause/supporting websites, comic strip and syndicate personal and corporate subscriptions, cause related marketing, comic conventions and cause campaigns which will all be attainable with partnership and support of an already established national foundation and cause like the Kidney Foundation of Canada. They alone have a social network of 10's of 1000's of people with extraordinary website visits, unique visitors and page views. Laughter is not only an easy sell...it's needed.
POP Remedy Yr 1 Marketing Plan: 

















We will grow our readership by multiple online means. Specifically, we will target the members and supporters of a comic strip's charity or foundation of choice with a strong, targeted marketing initiative across social networking websites.  We will target comic strip fans directly (of course!), and target new demographics outside comic and charity specific profile tags across ALL social networking websites.









Our marketing will prove successful after developing a new loyal fan base for the comic strip as well as educating and finding new supporters for charity/cause the comic represents.




POP Remedy Target Audiences:
First and foremost, our comics will target those that love comics and love to laugh. PERIOD. Our comics are not controlled by any industry, business or charity and are not themed after any charity/organization it may support. The comics and creators featured and distributed by POP Remedy Syndicate are simply passionate about people and planet, about charity and cause and philanthropy, and have decided to subscribe to a new syndicate model.
POP Remedy Launch Date: Our Syndicate and 1st comic will launch on World Kidney Day, March 13th, 2014. Approximately 8 months later we will have our first comic strip collection ready for print and purchase for the holiday season. 
POP REMEDY IS FOR EVERYBODY.


Total Funding Goal: $10,000





Tipping Point Funds will cover 3 needs essential to the development of the syndicate and inaugural comic strip which will lead to the content of our first POP Remedy published Comic Strip Compilation. The 1st is artist supplies for a full year of production. With experience, outside expertise and quotes from various worldwide suppliers. The 2nd is an updated computer system, hardware and software capable of bringing the syndicate and comic to life. The good people at apple store have put together a competitive business package that will meet my needs. The 3rd is professional website development for both the syndicate and comic strip. I have comparable quotes from established and reputable website designers. 

Beyond Funding Goal

If POP Remedy raises funds beyond the goal of $10,000, every penny extra will go towards simple target marketing the printing of the first comic strip collection. Having funds up front allows us to secure the books and sell and rather than rely on pre-sales. Our goal is to print and sell 10,000 copies of our first comic strip collection.
This will help raise thousands and thousands of dolllars for The Kidney Foundation of Canada, The Kidney March and World Kidney Day and ignite a revolution for good and set the stage for new comics and causes.

Amazing Perks!
From published recognition, to signed POP Remedy Collections, original signed strips and comic collections from some of comics best talents, and even 3 signed Garfield Collections from the great and influential Jim Davis...we have a PERK for every SUPPORTER!

<h3>2021 is a Special Year – the 700th Anniversary of Dante Alighieri’s Death</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I bring you the <strong>first</strong> <strong>fully hand-written, hand-illustrated version of the <i>Divine Comedy</i> since the 15th century</strong>. Join me in celebrating the Year of Dante with my Indiegogo campaign to publish <i>La Divina Commedia - The New Manuscript</i>. </p>
<p>Designed and Printed in Italy, my Fine Press, Limited Edition Divine Comedy will be Produced in Five Different Editions </p>
<p>A <strong>rare gift for collectors</strong>, scholars and enthusiasts, and an <strong>heirloom to pass on to future generations</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I first “met” Dante in Italy as a college student in the 90’s - and although I sensed the poem’s greatness, my first copy of the <i>Divine Comedy</i> seemed impossible to understand. I soon <strong>made it</strong> <strong>my life’s work to create a new <i>Divine Comedy</i> that a younger me would understand</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618838213/g0ve4qlxbd3rxw1oizxh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>For decades, even before beginning work on my manuscript, <strong>I carefully studied</strong> and researched the <i>Divine Comedy</i> by: </p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Learning Italian</strong> in order to understand the original text</li>
<li> <strong>Analyzing the past 700 years of art</strong> inspired by the Divine Comedy </li>
<li> <strong>Mastering</strong> my own original <strong>hand writing and graphic style</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p>And then, <strong>like a medieval monk</strong>, I spent every day for the past seven years writing and illustrating the manuscript by hand.</p>

<h3>Making The <i>Divine Comedy</i> More Accessible </h3>
<p>Dante's poetry is beautiful, but the truth is that the implications and the richness of his references are <strong>incredibly complex</strong>. The <i>Divine Comedy</i> is more widely known than read. I wanted to create a <strong>more engaging version for generations to come</strong>.</p>

<p>Over time, as I studied the centuries of <strong>illuminated manuscripts</strong> of the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, I recognized <strong>the connection</strong> between them and <strong>comic art</strong>. Just like early editions of the poem, a comic tells an easy-to-read story using words and pictures in sequential order. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Medieval Manuscripts as a Source of Inspirations </h3>
<p><strong>The marriage of words and pictures</strong> to tell a story is <strong>powerful</strong>.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>On the Shoulders of Giants </h3>
<p>I tried to understand <strong>seven centuries of art inspired by Dante’s work</strong>. I had to became familiar with not only <strong>Michelangelo</strong>, Botticelli, <strong>Gustave Doré</strong>, Joseph Koch, <strong>William Blake</strong>, but also <strong>Manfredo Manfredini</strong>, Ebba Holm, and <strong>Antonio Zatta</strong>. Studying illustrations alone was not enough: I desperately needed to see the <strong>exquisite medieval manuscripts</strong> Dante was familiar with, and to observe the relationship between the images and the text.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>In Search of The Perfect Text </h3>
<p>Once I saw the differences among Italian versions of Dante’s text, I began a research that took me back in time.</p>
<p>To underscore the philological uncertainty of the Commedia, I decided to transcribe three different sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><i>Inferno</i> — Giorgio Petrocchi (1967)</strong>: the most widely disseminated and generally accepted version of Dante's text. </li>
<li>
<strong><i>Purgatorio</i> — Codice Landiano (1336)</strong>: one of the oldest datable manuscripts of the Divine Comedy that has never been transcribed before. </li>
<li>
<strong><i>Paradiso</i> — Codice Trivulziano 1080 (1337)</strong>: largely considered one of the most “accurate” and finest of the early manuscripts of the Commedia.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Commedia and Comics</h3>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>American comic book writers</strong> had a huge influence on my work. <strong>Wallace Wood</strong>’s <i>22 Panels That Always Work </i>became something I looked to frequently; for instance, having just <strong>a sliver of the face visible</strong> (profil perdu) at the edge of the page brings <strong>the reader closer to the scene</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Beyond the Italian Reader </h3>
<p>George’s ambition is to <strong>spread his <i>Divine Comedy</i> all over the world</strong> using all the available translations. But his time on this planet is limited.</p>
<p>To reproduce Cochrane’s artwork in every language without losing the beauty of the handwritten text, we commissioned a <strong>typeface designer</strong> to create a <strong>digital font based on George’s lettering art</strong>.</p>
<p>We chose a <strong>contextual alternates</strong> font: each letter exists in 4-5 different forms that are randomly used in the text, so as to <strong>mimic real handwriting</strong> in the best possible way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Charles Singleton's Translation? </h3>
<p>The difficulty of translating Dante’s <i>Divine Comedy</i> has dogged scholars for centuries.</p>
<p>As George’s understanding deepened, he embraced <strong>Charles Singleton’s version as the finest</strong>. Singleton sidestepped the hurdle of Dante’s interlocking rhyme scheme by offering <strong>his translation in prose</strong>, and thereby freeing him to aspire to superior linguistic accuracy. His profound knowledge of Dante, resulting from <strong>years of</strong> <strong>his own cutting-edge research</strong>, informed his every word choice.</p>
<p>His commentaries, published separately, explained his translation decisions and explicated areas of ongoing textural disagreement.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>As every other project in the world, from making pancakes to building a space rocket, there are small and big challenges that we expect to solve during the production process. The good news is <strong>the entire artistic work is finished</strong>, and that was true even before we started our Indiegogo campaign! Our <strong>long experience in the publishing business</strong> gives us plenty of alternatives in terms of suppliers and technical solution, so everything we expect to be challenging will be solved by our hands-on approach. George Cochrane, the artist, lives in New York City, while the publishing team, printing company, and the binding workshop are all based in Italy. The distance might have represented a risk but now that all the art is finished and already shipped to Italy <strong>the risk is negligible</strong>. We're keeping it safe and ready to become the most beautiful <i>Divine Comedy</i> you've ever seen!</p>

</div></div>","Ciao, I’m George Cochrane, and welcome to my Indiegogo! 
After the wildly successful Kickstarter campaign, I now present you the entire Divine Comedy in a fresh and captivating graphic-novel style!  

A Symbol of Italian Culture, History and Language 
An Heirloom to Share with Your Children, Grandchildren, and Loved Ones 
A Divine Comedy Like You've Never Seen Before, in a Fine Press Edition

 



 
2021 is a Special Year – the 700th Anniversary of Dante Alighieri’s Death
 
I bring you the first fully hand-written, hand-illustrated version of the Divine Comedy since the 15th century. Join me in celebrating the Year of Dante with my Indiegogo campaign to publish La Divina Commedia - The New Manuscript. 
Designed and Printed in Italy, my Fine Press, Limited Edition Divine Comedy will be Produced in Five Different Editions 
A rare gift for collectors, scholars and enthusiasts, and an heirloom to pass on to future generations.
 

 
I first “met” Dante in Italy as a college student in the 90’s - and although I sensed the poem’s greatness, my first copy of the Divine Comedy seemed impossible to understand. I soon made it my life’s work to create a new Divine Comedy that a younger me would understand!
 



 
For decades, even before beginning work on my manuscript, I carefully studied and researched the Divine Comedy by: 

 Learning Italian in order to understand the original text
 Analyzing the past 700 years of art inspired by the Divine Comedy 
 Mastering my own original hand writing and graphic style. 

And then, like a medieval monk, I spent every day for the past seven years writing and illustrating the manuscript by hand.
 

 



Making The Divine Comedy More Accessible 
Dante's poetry is beautiful, but the truth is that the implications and the richness of his references are incredibly complex. The Divine Comedy is more widely known than read. I wanted to create a more engaging version for generations to come.
 

 

 

 

La Divina Commedia – The New Manuscript includes: 
 

384 Fully Illustrated Pages – 12” x 10” (30 x 25 cm.) 
7 Years of Work culminates in one of the most beautiful versions of the Divine Comedy ever created
Gorgeous Book Design Made and Printed in Italy, with Premium Materials

Over time, as I studied the centuries of illuminated manuscripts of the Divine Comedy, I recognized the connection between them and comic art. Just like early editions of the poem, a comic tells an easy-to-read story using words and pictures in sequential order. 
 
Medieval Manuscripts as a Source of Inspirations 
The marriage of words and pictures to tell a story is powerful. I thought that if I used comic art techniques, I could create a more accessible and engaging version of the Divine Comedy that would change the way modern and future generations read the poem, and maybe, just maybe, the Divine Comedy would become more widely read than ever before.
 

 
On the Shoulders of Giants 
I tried to understand seven centuries of art inspired by Dante’s work. I had to became familiar with not only Michelangelo, Botticelli, Gustave Doré, Joseph Koch, William Blake, but also Manfredo Manfredini, Ebba Holm, and Antonio Zatta. Studying illustrations alone was not enough: I desperately needed to see the exquisite medieval manuscripts Dante was familiar with, and to observe the relationship between the images and the text.
 
In Search of The Perfect Text 
Once I saw the differences among Italian versions of Dante’s text, I began a research that took me back in time.
To underscore the philological uncertainty of the Commedia, I decided to transcribe three different sources:


Inferno — Giorgio Petrocchi (1967): the most widely disseminated and generally accepted version of Dante's text. 

Purgatorio — Codice Landiano (1336): one of the oldest datable manuscripts of the Divine Comedy that has never been transcribed before. 

Paradiso — Codice Trivulziano 1080 (1337): largely considered one of the most “accurate” and finest of the early manuscripts of the Commedia.

 

 

 
The Commedia and Comics

 
American comic book writers had a huge influence on my work. Wallace Wood’s 22 Panels That Always Work became something I looked to frequently; for instance, having just a sliver of the face visible (profil perdu) at the edge of the page brings the reader closer to the scene.
 

 

 
Beyond the Italian Reader 
George’s ambition is to spread his Divine Comedy all over the world using all the available translations. But his time on this planet is limited.
To reproduce Cochrane’s artwork in every language without losing the beauty of the handwritten text, we commissioned a typeface designer to create a digital font based on George’s lettering art.
We chose a contextual alternates font: each letter exists in 4-5 different forms that are randomly used in the text, so as to mimic real handwriting in the best possible way.
 
Why Charles Singleton's Translation? 
The difficulty of translating Dante’s Divine Comedy has dogged scholars for centuries.
As George’s understanding deepened, he embraced Charles Singleton’s version as the finest. Singleton sidestepped the hurdle of Dante’s interlocking rhyme scheme by offering his translation in prose, and thereby freeing him to aspire to superior linguistic accuracy. His profound knowledge of Dante, resulting from years of his own cutting-edge research, informed his every word choice.
His commentaries, published separately, explained his translation decisions and explicated areas of ongoing textural disagreement.

<strong>Labyrinth Of Bones was started as a short story. I just wanted to set something in the world of myth and magic.

<p>The Year Of The Bones</p>
<p>The general thought is that you always put something of yourself into your work.

It turned into so much more.<br/>It wasnt just me on this roller coaster ride though. Misery loves company, and I had the best. <br/>First, the writing process went far better when my editor stepped in and made a few story suggestions. Erin Musgrave helped me really see that the kingdom of Farson was far bigger than I expected. It was also far darker. <br/>Erin became the Constant Reader in my life that Stephen King always spoke of. I can't begin to tell you how much she meant to the process. <br/>David Johnson Jr and Michael Wagoneer were also traversing rough waters, but they were also dedicated to creating. They saw something in the script that made them want to bring it to life. <br/>I had met the two in 2012 while working on Solestar, a charity book written by Siike Donnelly. I wanted to work with as many of that crew as I could, and continue to work towards that.<br/>Through health issues and personal issues, they hung on and kept me going. If Erin was my compass, Dave and Mikey were the sails, catching the wind and getting us to our destination. We are truly Brothers In Arms.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Mission: Our mission for SephrimMedia is to make it easy to distribute Independent work without the help of a publisher! Our fund raising goal is $20,000.</p>
<p>Funding Will Go To: If our project is successfully funded, we'll use the money for a few key things.</p>
<p>1. <strong>We will not need to outsource development of our site anymore</strong>, and we will be able to pay a programmer here in the US to continue building and adding new features. This will allow us to work much, much, more efficiently and bring our users new and updated features sooner.</p>
<p>Some new features include:</p>
<p>Online Store for each users to sell their Prints, Ebooks, Novels, Print Comics, etc.</p>
<p>Profile Customization- Users will be able to tweak the appearance of their profiles, including fonts, colors and banner image.</p>
<p>Portfolio- Users will be able to present their best work in a beautiful full screen view. </p>
<p>Analytic Tools- Users will be able to see the feedback, views, comments, and over all interaction their work is receiving. </p>
<p>Custom Social Plugins- Sephrim specific buttons including Like, Share, Vote, Favorite buttons and Activity Stream.</p>
<p>2. <strong>We want to make SephrimMedia more engaging and social</strong>, but to do that we need to add our own social buttons. These buttons will include our own Like button, Share button, Activity Stream, Vote button, and Favorite button! With the addition of these new features, our users will be able to share their awesome work not only with outside social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, but they will also be able to share it inside of our network.This will allow their work to be more visible, viral, and make it easier for artist and writers to connect with each other and around their content.  </p>
<p>3. <strong>Finally we will be using the funding for marketing and bring the product to life!</strong> SephrimMedia is already taking off with just the basic marketing we've been doing such as blogging, sharing users content to social networks such as Facebook, and overall word of mouth. <strong>This is a good thing because it represents our potential as a social platform</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Sephrimmedia is a social network for artists, writers and fans!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sephrimmedia.com/photos/65627459Meena%20Ad.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Meena, Sephrim Media.com""/></p>
<p> This new influx of capital, however, will allow for greater reach and exposure. We will need to do much more in the coming year to become more profitable and get the word out. Our new marketing initiatives will include Facebook Ads, StumbleUpon Ads, Google Adwords, and promoting at Atlanta's Dragon Con and AWA comic conventions.  At these conventions we need to rent tables to show the product would-be Sephrim users.<strong> join the Indie Art Revolution!</strong></p>
<p>Each one of these advertising strategies will require a significant amount of capital to make an impact, and we can only achieve this if we get funding from Indiegogo.</p>
<p>We haven't scratched the surface of what we want to do with SephrimMedia, and we appreciate any donation we receive here in the next few days. </p>
<p>Its been a long road, but a fruitful one. Here on our blog you can check out what we've been doing for the past year out of pocket. Its truly been a labor of love!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>There are too many amazing comic book artist, colorist, inkers, writers, as well as discerning readers with varying, evolving tastes and not enough Marvel and DC's to go around</strong>.<strong> Were looking to build a new self publishing tool for the digital age to help up and coming creatives get the recognition they deserve to keep their projects going! <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>We're extremely passionate about bringing the passions of our users to life! By funding us, your helping to fund our current users, and many, many more to come.</strong></p>

What We Need & What You Get
Mission: Our mission for SephrimMedia is to make it easy to distribute Independent work without the help of a publisher! Our fund raising goal is $20,000.
Funding Will Go To: If our project is successfully funded, we'll use the money for a few key things.
1. We will not need to outsource development of our site anymore, and we will be able to pay a programmer here in the US to continue building and adding new features. This will allow us to work much, much, more efficiently and bring our users new and updated features sooner.
Some new features include:
Online Store for each users to sell their Prints, Ebooks, Novels, Print Comics, etc.
Profile Customization- Users will be able to tweak the appearance of their profiles, including fonts, colors and banner image.
Portfolio- Users will be able to present their best work in a beautiful full screen view. 
Analytic Tools- Users will be able to see the feedback, views, comments, and over all interaction their work is receiving. 
Custom Social Plugins- Sephrim specific buttons including Like, Share, Vote, Favorite buttons and Activity Stream.
2. We want to make SephrimMedia more engaging and social, but to do that we need to add our own social buttons. These buttons will include our own Like button, Share button, Activity Stream, Vote button, and Favorite button! With the addition of these new features, our users will be able to share their awesome work not only with outside social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, but they will also be able to share it inside of our network.This will allow their work to be more visible, viral, and make it easier for artist and writers to connect with each other and around their content.  
3. Finally we will be using the funding for marketing and bring the product to life! SephrimMedia is already taking off with just the basic marketing we've been doing such as blogging, sharing users content to social networks such as Facebook, and overall word of mouth. This is a good thing because it represents our potential as a social platform. 
 

 This new influx of capital, however, will allow for greater reach and exposure. We will need to do much more in the coming year to become more profitable and get the word out. Our new marketing initiatives will include Facebook Ads, StumbleUpon Ads, Google Adwords, and promoting at Atlanta's Dragon Con and AWA comic conventions.  At these conventions we need to rent tables to show the product would-be Sephrim users. join the Indie Art Revolution!
Each one of these advertising strategies will require a significant amount of capital to make an impact, and we can only achieve this if we get funding from Indiegogo.
We haven't scratched the surface of what we want to do with SephrimMedia, and we appreciate any donation we receive here in the next few days. 
Its been a long road, but a fruitful one. Here on our blog you can check out what we've been doing for the past year out of pocket. Its truly been a labor of love!
 


The Impact
There are too many amazing comic book artist, colorist, inkers, writers, as well as discerning readers with varying, evolving tastes and not enough Marvel and DC's to go around. Were looking to build a new self publishing tool for the digital age to help up and coming creatives get the recognition they deserve to keep their projects going! 
We're extremely passionate about bringing the passions of our users to life! By funding us, your helping to fund our current users, and many, many more to come.

<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>I need like $3400. </b>I know $3400 is a lot of money. It's kind of crazy. But that is what it costs to print and ship 1000 paperback books, according to my research. <b>I'm not gonna use the money for anything ridiculous</b>. I just want to print the books and get the work out there in its intended formant.</p>
<p>Alas, Indiegogo and credit card companies take about 8% of your contributions. So that leaves 92% of $3400 for me to produce the books and get them into stores. With anything left over I may pay for tables at comics shows where I will sell the books, <b>and all of the money from those sales go to me, the artist. </b></p>
<p>I have been making comics for years and so far I have gotten one royalty check for around $8. Nobody makes much money from publishing, but what little money there is should go to the artist. I expect we can all agree on that?<b> Cool. Self publishing is the best way to ensure this.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440222815/lkdntai5ls3tlwdnsnnq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Still, I've been shopping the book around to publishers. There has been some interest<b>, but it is really hard to get a book like this published these days, </b>so I am taking it upon myself to do so<b>, because I believe strongly in this work. </b>It is some of my best, and some of the best in comics!<b> </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b></b></span><b>it is hard to market something like this</b>, and so the industry wants nothing to do with it, but I'm betting I can get some help with distribution at least if I finance the whole thing myself <b>(with your help!).</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>There are so many perks and rewards available to those who contribute! Choose which best fits your budget from the sidebar on the right!</b></p>
<p>My parents have rich friends, so maybe this will be a successful funding campaign, but if not, if I don't raise quite enough to print all the books as planned, I will print fewer copies on demand, so everyone still wins, and y'all can get yr perks. The books will be the same, maybe slightly less fancy, but worth it. With any left over money I will buy a sandwich. <b>But let's focus on meeting that goal!</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437870586/opxncg4y7mzi4rtjoam4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The book is largely finished. <b>I have well over 100 pages of comics ready to go,</b> with a few more in the works. The whole book will be 128 pages. I'm pretty good at putting a book together. You may have seen my other book <b>""On the Books""</b> which came out last year.</p>
<p><a href=""http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/books/5161/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/books/5161/</a></p>
<p>It got some good reviews, and I'm happy with it. It looks really nice, and this one will too. They will stand as sort of companion volumes, <b>both dealing with how a young working artist makes their way thru the world, overcoming obstacles and staying cheery all the while. </b>I feel like these comics are kind of clogging me up and I need to get them out into the world before I can move on as an artist. Does that make sense? Also posterity. </p>

<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Putting a book together is fun and hard, and very rewarding. I've done this many times on a small scale, and a large scale. <b>This book is kinda large scale.</b> Most of the comics are ready to go and formatted for printing already. I have made a few sample copies of the book  using POD services. <b>It looks good</b>. The greatest risk is the abject humiliation of a failed fundraising campaign, but hey, you gotta be in it to win it! LET'S <b>DO</b> THIS!!! <b>The world needs Golden Age!</b></p>

·  “Lucky Break” - About cars and driving, and the auto accident and subsequent insurance payout which allowed me to move from Huntington, Long Island to NYC in the first place.
· “Plagued Out” – How I endured a bedbug infestation; general fears of viral epidemics.
·  “White Whale of The Bay”- About Wu-Tang Clan, hip-hop, and record collecting; when I found that rare GZA LP in San Francisco, of all places.
· “420” and “Ennuied”- A story which explores my marijuana habit, marijuana politics, and being a role model to my younger brother.
·  “Video Bros.”- A love letter to video games and brotherhood; the story of waiting in line for Nintendo’s Wii console for four nights at their NYC flagship store.
· “Abuse”- A personal account of domestic abuse and bi-polar disorder.
·  “Waiting For The End Of The World”- An exploration of the climate change crisis and my personal climate change anxieties.
""Arrested Development""- A review and analysis of season four of the cult classic TV show.and more! They all add up to a cohesive story, well told! you can read many of them online already. Follow the links above.


What I Need & What You Get
I need like $3400. I know $3400 is a lot of money. It's kind of crazy. But that is what it costs to print and ship 1000 paperback books, according to my research. I'm not gonna use the money for anything ridiculous. I just want to print the books and get the work out there in its intended formant.
Alas, Indiegogo and credit card companies take about 8% of your contributions. So that leaves 92% of $3400 for me to produce the books and get them into stores. With anything left over I may pay for tables at comics shows where I will sell the books, and all of the money from those sales go to me, the artist. 
I have been making comics for years and so far I have gotten one royalty check for around $8. Nobody makes much money from publishing, but what little money there is should go to the artist. I expect we can all agree on that? Cool. Self publishing is the best way to ensure this.



Still, I've been shopping the book around to publishers. There has been some interest, but it is really hard to get a book like this published these days, so I am taking it upon myself to do so, because I believe strongly in this work. It is some of my best, and some of the best in comics! it is hard to market something like this, and so the industry wants nothing to do with it, but I'm betting I can get some help with distribution at least if I finance the whole thing myself (with your help!).
There are so many perks and rewards available to those who contribute! Choose which best fits your budget from the sidebar on the right!
My parents have rich friends, so maybe this will be a successful funding campaign, but if not, if I don't raise quite enough to print all the books as planned, I will print fewer copies on demand, so everyone still wins, and y'all can get yr perks. The books will be the same, maybe slightly less fancy, but worth it. With any left over money I will buy a sandwich. But let's focus on meeting that goal!


The Impact
The book is largely finished. I have well over 100 pages of comics ready to go, with a few more in the works. The whole book will be 128 pages. I'm pretty good at putting a book together. You may have seen my other book ""On the Books"" which came out last year.
http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/books/5161/
It got some good reviews, and I'm happy with it. It looks really nice, and this one will too. They will stand as sort of companion volumes, both dealing with how a young working artist makes their way thru the world, overcoming obstacles and staying cheery all the while. I feel like these comics are kind of clogging me up and I need to get them out into the world before I can move on as an artist. Does that make sense? Also posterity. 

jk.

Risks & Challenges
Putting a book together is fun and hard, and very rewarding. I've done this many times on a small scale, and a large scale. This book is kinda large scale. Most of the comics are ready to go and formatted for printing already. I have made a few sample copies of the book  using POD services. It looks good. The greatest risk is the abject humiliation of a failed fundraising campaign, but hey, you gotta be in it to win it! LET'S DO THIS!!! The world needs Golden Age!

L’imaginaire est un de ses lieux favoris et elle s’applique à partager ce goût de l’aventure artistique avec tout ceux et celles qui voudront bien s’y essayer. Des yeux curieux ouverts sur l’univers, elle se promène de planète en planète et aperçoit partout, des promesses. Son expérience dans le domaine de l’organisation de festivals à Montréal lui a donné les compétences nécessaires à la gestion des œuvres des auteurs, de la recherche de publicités et de commandites, ainsi qu’à la réalisation de l’infographie de la revue.<br/></p><p><b>Émilie Dagenais</b><br/><span>Émilie est une passionnée de la vie : elle dévore les livres comme la bonne cuisine et le bon vin. Amatrice de bandes dessinées de tous horizons depuis son plus jeune âge, son attrait pour la bande dessinée québécoise est naturellement apparu lors de la création des maisons d’édition “La Pastèque’’ et ‘’Mécanique Générale’’. Ses expériences de travail, notamment dans l’expédition de documents, la comptabilité et le service à la clientèle dans différents domaines, lui ont donné au fil des ans les capacités requises à la gestion des abonnements, de la distribution de la revue et l’alimentation du site internet de PLANCHES. </span><br/></p><p><u>Design graphique et multimédia</u></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/801791/files/20140820194021-Num_ro00maquette17.jpg?1408588821"" src="""" style=""width: 134.803347280335px; height: 178px;""/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/801890/files/20140820205043-Num_ro00maquette128.jpg?1408593043"" src="""" style=""width: 145.46564885496184px; height: 192px;""/><p style=""display: inline !important;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/801889/files/20140820204934-Num_ro00maquette130.jpg?1408592974"" src="""" style=""width: 149.76410256410256px; height: 196px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/801888/files/20140820204726-Num_ro00maquette134.jpg?1408592846"" src="""" style=""width: 152.04584527220632px; height: 201px;""/></p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></b><p></p><p><b><a href=""http://www.utopsie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Francisco Sottolichio</a></b> : Graphiste responsable de la structure initiale de la revue.</p><p><b><a href=""http://lafillevoyage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aude Mermilliod</a></b> : Designer du logo   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/801792/files/20140820194218-logo_noirplus_petit.jpg?1408588938"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 132.7924528301887px; height: 46px; background-color: initial;""/> et du design de la couverture de la revue.</p><p><b>Jean-Philippe Granger </b>: Travailleur autonome dans la production vidéo et maître d’œuvre de la  vidéo de campagne.</p><p><b><a href=""http://maxherve.wix.com/music"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maxime Hervé</a></b> : Compositeur de musique de films, il a notamment composé le rythme entraînant de la vidéo de campagne.</p><p><u>Chroniqueurs internet</u></p><p><b>Eric Bouchard</b> : Professeur de français au Cégep du Vieux Montréal, Eric aime analyser en profondeur la structure des bandes dessinées.</p><p><b>Mathieu Li-Goyette</b> : Éditeur en chef de la revue Panorama Cinéma, il tient également depuis plusieurs années le blog <a href=""http://lamarellebd.blogspot.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">‘’La Marelle’’</a>, qui parle de BD, entre autres choses.</p><p><b>Émilie Dagenais</b> : Co-fondatrice de la revue PLANCHES, passionnée de bulles en tous genres.

Pouvez-vous faire une exception?”</i><br/>- Oui ! Vous devrez inclure un montant de 10$ par numéro (soit un total de 40$ pour une année) afin de défrayer les coûts de transport.</p><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>“Où sera disponible la revue une fois la campagne terminée?”</i><br/>- La revue sera disponible dans la plupart des librairies indépendantes de Montréal, Québec et plusieurs autres villes à travers le Québec. Aussi, notre site internet aura, en temps requis, une boutique où il vous sera possible d’acheter les numéros de votre choix ou de vous abonner et de recevoir les numéros chez vous par la poste. Bien sûr, nous serons dans plusieurs salons et ventes de livres au courant de l’année 2015 et les années suivantes; vous pourrez suivre nos déplacements via notre site internet et venir nous rencontrer près de chez vous !</span></div><div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><p><i>“Mon amie et moi aimerions vous aider en donnant chacune la moitié de l’argent pour avoir la revue et les autres produits dans le paquet ‘’LA REVUE DANS TES MAINS’’. Est-ce que c’est possible?”</i><br/>- Étant donné que seule une transaction vous donnera accès à la récompense d’Indiegogo, il est suggéré de payer avec une seule carte de crédit puis de vous arranger pour diviser l’argent entre vous.</p>
<br/><p><i>“J’aimerais beaucoup avoir la revue seulement, mais mon cousin veut l’ex-libris. Est-ce que vous pouvez arranger la livraison à deux adresses différentes?”</i><br/>-  Malheureusement non.</p>
<p><i>""Vous ne publiez que des auteurs québécois? Êtes-vous racistes?""</i><br/>- PLANCHES ne publie que des auteurs Québécois ou des oeuvres réalisées au Québec, comme dans le cas d’une résidence. Ce choix se fait dans l’idée que les bandes dessinées québécoises sont relativement peu connues dans la province ainsi que dans le reste de la francophonie.</p>
<br/><p><i>“Si vous n’atteignez pas votre objectif de 20 000 $, est-ce que le projet tombe à l’eau?”</i><br/>- Bien sûr que non! Sandra, Émilie et toute l’équipe sont décidés à créer ce centre de discussion de la bande dessinée québécoise. C’est pourquoi, même si la revue papier ne peut exister sans les fonds amassés par cette campagne, le site pourra prendre la relève et l’équipe concentrera alors ses énergies dessus pour dynamiser ce mode de diffusion (chaîne YouTube, journalisme spécialisé de la bande dessinée, critiques, etc).</p>
<br/><p><i>“Il n’y a pas des subventions qui pourraient plutôt vous soutenir au lieu d’une campagne de socio-financement?”<br/></i>- Oui, mais seulement après 1 an d’existence ou 2 numéros publiés. L’organisme PLANCHES aura 1 an en avril 2015, mais nous ne pourrons publier deux numéros dans une rentrée d’argent significative comme dans le cas de cette campagne.</p>
<br/><p><i>“Qu’est-ce qui vous différencie des autres publications collectives comme Zidara9 et Front Froid?”</i><br/>- En ce qui concerne l’aspect ‘physique’ de la question,  PLANCHES sera notamment imprimé en couleurs et publié à tous les trois mois. Pour ce qui est du contenu, PLANCHES propose plusieurs genres de bandes dessinées en un seul recueil.</p>
<br/><p><i>“Quels ont été les principaux défis reliés au lancement d’une revue de bandes dessinées ?”</i><br/>- Comme tout nouveau projet d’édition, il a d’abord fallu réaliser un “plan d’affaires” afin de prévoir nos prochaines années d'existence, tant au niveau financier que celui des activités de promotion. Il a aussi été nécessaire d’effectuer un budget prévisionnel de manière rigoureuse afin de savoir comment les finances de l’organisme se porteraient d’ici à la fin de la 3e année d’existence, d’un point de vue optimiste, réaliste et pessimiste. La préparation effectuée de ce côté a d’ailleurs été félicitée par les conseillers financiers de l’équipe.</p>
<p><i>“Comment avez-vous fixé vos objectifs éditoriaux ?”</i><br/>- Cette étape a été très longue puisqu’elle nécessitait une réflexion posée et maintes fois éprouvée par une discussion avec les auteurs et les éditeurs du milieu. Le premier numéro de la revue est doté d’une mouture qui représente à la fois la volonté de l’équipe de faire découvrir de nouveaux auteurs au public et une variété intéressante de types d’histoires.</p>
<br/><p><i>“Travaillez-vous déjà sur le deuxième numéro, même si vous n’avez pas encore la certitude de  remporter votre campagne de financement ?”</i><br/>- Oui ! Le travail de production des auteurs ainsi que le travail nécessaire à la production d’une revue comme PLANCHES prend plusieurs mois de travail. Notre but sur le long terme est de prendre une avance de deux numéros pour la production, ce qui est un objectif très réaliste. Le 2e numéro sortira à la mi-janvier 2015.</p>
<br/><p><i>“Que comptez-vous publier sur votre site internet qui ne sera pas dans la revue ?”</i><br/>- Le site internet est complémentaire à la revue, c’est à dire qu’il apporte surtout le côté rédaction qui ne s’y retrouve pas. À long terme, nous espérons avoir les fonds nécessaires pour rémunérer les collaborateurs et même créer des capsules vidéos de bonne qualité. Mais ça, c’est pour plus tard!</p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>“Qu’est-ce qui me dit que vous ne partirez pas avec l’argent pour vous baigner à Cuba?’’</i><br/>- Sandra et Émilie, les deux co-fondatrices, ont lié leur identité avec ce projet, en se mettant de l’avant dans la vidéo et en dévoilant leur nom. Voler cet argent les stigmatiserait pour le restant de leurs vies. Et contrairement aux politiciens, elles ne disposeraient d’aucune immunité face à ce délit.</span><br/>

Illustration : Michel Hellman- Extrait d'une page du prototype : entrevue avec Julien Paré-Sorel sur Léthéonie- Appel à planches lancé le 15 août pour le numéro 02La bande dessinée est d’une inépuisable versatilité, et c’est dans cet univers infini que  PLANCHES souhaite vous faire explorer à tous les trois mois. De la simple caricature à l’histoire de plusieurs pages, en passant par le strip de 4 cases, la revue vous offrira une expérience de lecture aux effets narratifs variés.
Mission de l'organisme
PLANCHES a pour mandat de faire la promotion de la bande dessinée québécoise et de ses artistes. Nous y parviendrons en publiant la revue, en assurant sa distribution sur l’ensemble du Québec et en rémunérant les auteurs participants. À cela s’ajoute la création d’un site internetque nous alimentons d’ores et déjà et en critiques et en analyses d’œuvre, en informations concernant des événements à venir ainsi qu’en plusieurs autres sections toutes relatives, d’une manière ou d’une autre, à la bande dessinée québécoise.Des questions? Consultez notre FAQ en bas de page ou écrivez-nous à info@revueplanches.com, nous vous répondrons dans les meilleurs délais.- Vincent Partel ""Guro""PLANCHES encourage le travail au Québec et une production éco-responsablePLANCHES se veut une revue verte ET québécoise! Au nom de ces valeurs qui nous tiennent à cœur, nous nous refusons d'imprimer les revues à l'étranger, ou encore d'utiliser du papier issu de coupes à blanc, et nous mettons un point d'honneur à soutenir le travail des auteurs par le biais d'une rémunération juste.Plus particulièrement du côté des auteurs, la campagne nous permettra de leur verser un salaire symbolique (très en dessous des normes dans le domaine, cependant). Toutefois, dans les prochains mois, les revenus perçus par nos ventes, par nos commanditaires ainsi que par nos annonceurs nous permettront assurément d’améliorer significativement leur salaire.Notre imprimeur nous a fourni toutes les informations nécessaires afin de faire un choix éclairé pour le papier utilisé pour PLANCHES. Il s'agit d'un papier homologué FSC, c’est à dire issu de forêts durablement gérées.- Saturnome ""Chronique Sciences""Où ira l’argent ?L’argent récolté pendant la campagne servira à financer le premier numéro ainsi que les frais de démarrage de notre organisme.Production- 4 500 $ pour l’impression Offset en couleurs sur du papier FSC- 2 500 $ pour le graphisme (mise en page de la revue)- 2 500 $ pour les auteurs- 2000 $ en frais de campagne (4 % Indiegogo + 3,5% Paypal / Square + production des récompenses)TOTAL : 10 500$ (58%)Administration- 350 $ en logiciels et espace de stockage virtuel- 500 $ pour la location de notre local jusqu’en janvier- 300 $ de frais d’hébergement pour notre site internet pour les 3 prochaines années- 2000 $ de salaire pour les deux éditrices en chef (1000 $ chacune)TOTAL : 3 150$ (16%)Diffusion- 1500 $ pour le lancement (ligue d’impro, location de salle, matériel promotionnel)- 450 $ pour les frais de salons comme Expozine ou les Rendez-vous de la BD de Gatineau de 2014- 500 $ pour la distribution (location de camion)- 2 500 $ pour les envois postauxTOTAL : 4 950$ (26%)GRAND TOTAL : 18 600 $Plan d’action- Comme le processus de création du premier numéro est déjà commencé depuis le début du mois de juin, terminer le tout en l’envoyant à l’imprimerie pendant le mois de septembre.- Terminer les préparatifs du lancement officiel, prévu le 23 octobre 2014 en soirée, à la salle Ô Patro Vys, à Montréal.

Voyez leurs profils, rapidement décrits ci-dessous, pour mieux les connaître.Les co-fondatricesSandra VilderInvestie peut-être un peu trop à la folie dans le projet PLANCHES, Sandra cultive son jardin et son bonheur. L’imaginaire est un de ses lieux favoris et elle s’applique à partager ce goût de l’aventure artistique avec tout ceux et celles qui voudront bien s’y essayer. Des yeux curieux ouverts sur l’univers, elle se promène de planète en planète et aperçoit partout, des promesses. Son expérience dans le domaine de l’organisation de festivals à Montréal lui a donné les compétences nécessaires à la gestion des œuvres des auteurs, de la recherche de publicités et de commandites, ainsi qu’à la réalisation de l’infographie de la revue.Émilie DagenaisÉmilie est une passionnée de la vie : elle dévore les livres comme la bonne cuisine et le bon vin. Amatrice de bandes dessinées de tous horizons depuis son plus jeune âge, son attrait pour la bande dessinée québécoise est naturellement apparu lors de la création des maisons d’édition “La Pastèque’’ et ‘’Mécanique Générale’’. Ses expériences de travail, notamment dans l’expédition de documents, la comptabilité et le service à la clientèle dans différents domaines, lui ont donné au fil des ans les capacités requises à la gestion des abonnements, de la distribution de la revue et l’alimentation du site internet de PLANCHES.

Nous n'en attendions pas moins de vous, fier lecteur ! Nous voulons vous remercier, tout d'abord pour votre attention, mais également pour votre soutien, que vous ayez donné de l'argent et/ou partagé la page et la vidéo sur vos réseaux. Votre confiance nous touche énormément. Nous vous garantissons que nous saurons nous montrer à la hauteur du projet !FAQ“Je veux vous envoyer de l’argent mais je ne veux pas vous donner mon adresse, est-ce que c’est possible?”- Oui, cependant, il sera impossible de vous envoyer votre récompense.“Je ne suis pas au Canada mais j’aimerais quand même m’abonner pour un an. Pouvez-vous faire une exception?”- Oui ! Vous devrez inclure un montant de 10$ par numéro (soit un total de 40$ pour une année) afin de défrayer les coûts de transport.“Où sera disponible la revue une fois la campagne terminée?”- La revue sera disponible dans la plupart des librairies indépendantes de Montréal, Québec et plusieurs autres villes à travers le Québec. Aussi, notre site internet aura, en temps requis, une boutique où il vous sera possible d’acheter les numéros de votre choix ou de vous abonner et de recevoir les numéros chez vous par la poste. Bien sûr, nous serons dans plusieurs salons et ventes de livres au courant de l’année 2015 et les années suivantes; vous pourrez suivre nos déplacements via notre site internet et venir nous rencontrer près de chez vous !
“Mon amie et moi aimerions vous aider en donnant chacune la moitié de l’argent pour avoir la revue et les autres produits dans le paquet ‘’LA REVUE DANS TES MAINS’’. Est-ce que c’est possible?”- Étant donné que seule une transaction vous donnera accès à la récompense d’Indiegogo, il est suggéré de payer avec une seule carte de crédit puis de vous arranger pour diviser l’argent entre vous.
“J’aimerais beaucoup avoir la revue seulement, mais mon cousin veut l’ex-libris. Est-ce que vous pouvez arranger la livraison à deux adresses différentes?”-  Malheureusement non.
""Vous ne publiez que des auteurs québécois? Êtes-vous racistes?""- PLANCHES ne publie que des auteurs Québécois ou des oeuvres réalisées au Québec, comme dans le cas d’une résidence. Ce choix se fait dans l’idée que les bandes dessinées québécoises sont relativement peu connues dans la province ainsi que dans le reste de la francophonie.
“Si vous n’atteignez pas votre objectif de 20 000 $, est-ce que le projet tombe à l’eau?”- Bien sûr que non! Sandra, Émilie et toute l’équipe sont décidés à créer ce centre de discussion de la bande dessinée québécoise. C’est pourquoi, même si la revue papier ne peut exister sans les fonds amassés par cette campagne, le site pourra prendre la relève et l’équipe concentrera alors ses énergies dessus pour dynamiser ce mode de diffusion (chaîne YouTube, journalisme spécialisé de la bande dessinée, critiques, etc).
“Il n’y a pas des subventions qui pourraient plutôt vous soutenir au lieu d’une campagne de socio-financement?”- Oui, mais seulement après 1 an d’existence ou 2 numéros publiés. L’organisme PLANCHES aura 1 an en avril 2015, mais nous ne pourrons publier deux numéros dans une rentrée d’argent significative comme dans le cas de cette campagne.
“Qu’est-ce qui vous différencie des autres publications collectives comme Zidara9 et Front Froid?”- En ce qui concerne l’aspect ‘physique’ de la question,  PLANCHES sera notamment imprimé en couleurs et publié à tous les trois mois. Pour ce qui est du contenu, PLANCHES propose plusieurs genres de bandes dessinées en un seul recueil.
“Quels ont été les principaux défis reliés au lancement d’une revue de bandes dessinées ?”- Comme tout nouveau projet d’édition, il a d’abord fallu réaliser un “plan d’affaires” afin de prévoir nos prochaines années d'existence, tant au niveau financier que celui des activités de promotion. Il a aussi été nécessaire d’effectuer un budget prévisionnel de manière rigoureuse afin de savoir comment les finances de l’organisme se porteraient d’ici à la fin de la 3e année d’existence, d’un point de vue optimiste, réaliste et pessimiste. La préparation effectuée de ce côté a d’ailleurs été félicitée par les conseillers financiers de l’équipe.
“Comment avez-vous fixé vos objectifs éditoriaux ?”- Cette étape a été très longue puisqu’elle nécessitait une réflexion posée et maintes fois éprouvée par une discussion avec les auteurs et les éditeurs du milieu. Le premier numéro de la revue est doté d’une mouture qui représente à la fois la volonté de l’équipe de faire découvrir de nouveaux auteurs au public et une variété intéressante de types d’histoires.
“Travaillez-vous déjà sur le deuxième numéro, même si vous n’avez pas encore la certitude de  remporter votre campagne de financement ?”- Oui ! Le travail de production des auteurs ainsi que le travail nécessaire à la production d’une revue comme PLANCHES prend plusieurs mois de travail. Notre but sur le long terme est de prendre une avance de deux numéros pour la production, ce qui est un objectif très réaliste. Le 2e numéro sortira à la mi-janvier 2015.
“Que comptez-vous publier sur votre site internet qui ne sera pas dans la revue ?”- Le site internet est complémentaire à la revue, c’est à dire qu’il apporte surtout le côté rédaction qui ne s’y retrouve pas. À long terme, nous espérons avoir les fonds nécessaires pour rémunérer les collaborateurs et même créer des capsules vidéos de bonne qualité. Mais ça, c’est pour plus tard!
“Qu’est-ce qui me dit que vous ne partirez pas avec l’argent pour vous baigner à Cuba?’’- Sandra et Émilie, les deux co-fondatrices, ont lié leur identité avec ce projet, en se mettant de l’avant dans la vidéo et en dévoilant leur nom. Voler cet argent les stigmatiserait pour le restant de leurs vies. Et contrairement aux politiciens, elles ne disposeraient d’aucune immunité face à ce délit.

<h3><u>About</u></h3>
<p>I'm <strong>Phillip Steyn</strong>, a gay South African guy and the creator of ""A Gay Idiot"". People know me for my laugh and my beard. I love coffee, and cuddling in the winter.</p>
<p>""<strong>A Gay Idiot</strong>"" is a webcomic (updated every Monday, Wednesday and Friday), about my experiences of being a gay man in Cape Town. I mostly have no idea what I'm doing in life, and in order to deal with that, I work through my thoughts and issues in a (hopefully) entertaining webcomic.</p>
<p>Seeing that I've been doing the webcomic for a bit over a year now, <strong>I've decided to compile the first 100 comics into a book</strong> (after some encouragement from friends and fans). It is the first ""arc"" of my comics where I am finding my feet, both as myself in life and as a comic artist. The book will be launched at<strong> <a href=""https://www.comicconafrica.co.za/en.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Comic Con Africa</a></strong>, which is taking place from the 14th to the 16th of September 2018.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532021442/eivh1rbnnp5puybqdlyc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Book Front Cover</p>
<p><strong>Vol. 1: Haphazardous Living</strong> will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comics [001] - [100]</li>
<li>Personal Essays interspersed throughout the book</li>
<li>At least 5 exclusive never-before seen comics</li>
<li>Extra fun activities</li>
<li>Names of contributors (refer to the different reward tiers)</li>
<li>Every copy will be signed</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this a reality, I'm asking friends, family and fans of the comic to help in any way they possibly can. This webcomic, albeit quite simple in nature, has helped me in ways I cannot possibly explain. <strong>It's the one thing in my life that I feel exceptionally proud of</strong>. Bearing this in mind I'm asking you to take a small leap of faith along with me, to see where the comic can go.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>What We Need</u></h3>
<p>This campaign hopes to cover the cost of several things, depending on how successful it is. The full campaign is aiming to raise <strong>$2,500</strong>, which will cover printing costs, costs involving ISBN registration, marketing costs, exhibition fees at Comic Con Africa, transport and related travel fees.</p>
<p>I have opted for flexible funding, in order to ensure that I can get the books printed, even if we just manage to raise half of the funds needed (half of the budget goes to printing).</p>
<p><strong>Here is a breakdown</strong> of where the funds will go if the campaign is successful (breakdown is in order of priority):</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,250 - Printing</li>
<li>$220 - Comic Con Africa Fees</li>
<li>$300 - Transport</li>
<li>$280 - Accommodation</li>
<li>$100 - Marketing and Misc. Fees</li>
<li>$100 - Reward fulfilment</li>
<li>$250 - Buffer (Start of next print cycle, price changes, or unexpected fees)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any surplus fees will go directly to printing more books and future projects that I have lined up for the comic. Believe me, I have so many plans for what I want to do with the comic it's not even funny!! (Maybe a little funny.)</p>
<p>Some <strong>stretch goals</strong> have been identified in case more funds are raised than expected. These include hardcover copies for high tier contributors, more zines to be included in the Zine Compilation, and an animated short of any one of my ""A Gay Idiot"" comics.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>In terms of risks and challenges, there aren't that many. Most of them just revolve around timing, such as the timing for the book to go to the printers, timing around my planning around the weekend of Comic Con Africa, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>, and respective contingencies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Ensuring enough funding is raised in time so that the printers get the book early enough</i><ul><li>The book, which mainly contains comics that are already done, is in the process of being compiled into a PDF for the printers. It will be finished within the first two weeks of the campaign. If enough funding has been raised at that point, the PDF will be sent ASAP to ensure the books are printed in time for Comic Con Africa.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>Ensuring the book and other rewards are punctually delivered to contributors</i><ul><li>This is a more significant challenge for contributors that reside outside of South Africa. The most affordable way to send any items internationally is with PostNet (using services by Aramex), which uses a service without tracking numbers (as they ingest packages directly into the international postal stream). Should contributors want to use a service such as DHL (at an additional cost, but a tracking number is given), they can arrange with me to do so. South African packages will be sent using PostNet.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>Planning the Comic Con Africa weekend</i><ul><li>I'm relying on funds in order to make sure the weekend goes as smoothly as possible, but if not enough funds are raised in order to do this, I have several contingencies which include staying with family or friends. This would heavily inconvenience them in their day to day routines, so I'm not entirely sure how reliable of an option this actually is.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks</strong> surrounding the book, and respective contingencies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Book Quality</i><ul><li>The printing company I'm planning on using (<u><a href=""https://www.printondemand.co.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Print On Demand</a></u>), has a quick turnaround time and does do proof printing before completing the order. Therefore I am able to check that the book quality is up to standard and that I'm 100% happy with it.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<i>Enough Supply</i><ul><li>I'm starting with a small run initially in order to gauge interest in the book during the initial days of the campaign. If the campaign is successful I will be printing a run of 200 books. Luckily the printing company can speedily print more copies if the need arises.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the major risks and challenges currently on my mind for the campaign. Be assured that I will be transparent if any unexpected challenges should arise. Feel free to contact me with regards to any other concerns not directly addressed here.</p>

<h3><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></h3>
<p>Obviously, the best way to support my comic is by following it on <strong><a href=""https://fb.me/gayidiotcomic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://instagram.com/gayidiot_comic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://tapas.io/series/gayidiotcomic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tapas</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/a-gay-idiot/list?title_no=195086"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WebToon</a></strong>. Be sure to tell all your friends and family about the comic. Word of mouth is definitely the best kind of marketing.</p>
<p>You can also support me by contributing to my <strong><a href=""https://www.patreon.com/gayidiotcomic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a></strong>, where I post the comic 24 hours in advance, publish sketches and rejected ideas, and load video diaries, with more rewards to be introduced in the future.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532022917/ejdhxolfr0smxium4wr5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Honestly...</p>
<p>This has been in the making for some time now. The comic is one of the most consistent things in my life. I have put a lot of my life into this endeavour. It might not be grand or mega-popular, but I'm proud of it. It's my baby. The comics are based on my life. Sometimes the comics are actually brutally honest, to the point where people have messaged me to check if I'm doing okay.</p>
<p>People have told me that I seem either desperate or overly depressing, but I didn't want to make a comic where everything is just sunshine and roses. Most gay-related webcomics (or at least the slice-of-life variety into which my comic falls) tend to focus on either happy normal relationships (that I don't have and cannot relate to at this point of my life) or an active sex life (hahahahahaha what is that??). My life will never be like what you see on instagram, and therefore I can only be myself, which I often make fun of in my comic.</p>
<p>I am super grateful for everyone who has supported me and my comic thus far. You all have no idea how much your support means to me. I love you, whoever you are. &lt;3</p>

""A Gay Idiot"" is a webcomic (updated every Monday, Wednesday and Friday), about my experiences of being a gay man in Cape Town. I mostly have no idea what I'm doing in life, and in order to deal with that, I work through my thoughts and issues in a (hopefully) entertaining webcomic.
Seeing that I've been doing the webcomic for a bit over a year now, I've decided to compile the first 100 comics into a book (after some encouragement from friends and fans). It is the first ""arc"" of my comics where I am finding my feet, both as myself in life and as a comic artist. The book will be launched at Comic Con Africa, which is taking place from the 14th to the 16th of September 2018.

Book Front Cover
Vol. 1: Haphazardous Living will include the following:

Comics [001] - [100]
Personal Essays interspersed throughout the book
At least 5 exclusive never-before seen comics
Extra fun activities
Names of contributors (refer to the different reward tiers)
Every copy will be signed

To make this a reality, I'm asking friends, family and fans of the comic to help in any way they possibly can. This webcomic, albeit quite simple in nature, has helped me in ways I cannot possibly explain. It's the one thing in my life that I feel exceptionally proud of. Bearing this in mind I'm asking you to take a small leap of faith along with me, to see where the comic can go.
 

What We Need
This campaign hopes to cover the cost of several things, depending on how successful it is. The full campaign is aiming to raise $2,500, which will cover printing costs, costs involving ISBN registration, marketing costs, exhibition fees at Comic Con Africa, transport and related travel fees.
I have opted for flexible funding, in order to ensure that I can get the books printed, even if we just manage to raise half of the funds needed (half of the budget goes to printing).
Here is a breakdown of where the funds will go if the campaign is successful (breakdown is in order of priority):

$1,250 - Printing
$220 - Comic Con Africa Fees
$300 - Transport
$280 - Accommodation
$100 - Marketing and Misc. Fees
$100 - Reward fulfilment
$250 - Buffer (Start of next print cycle, price changes, or unexpected fees)

Any surplus fees will go directly to printing more books and future projects that I have lined up for the comic. Believe me, I have so many plans for what I want to do with the comic it's not even funny!! (Maybe a little funny.)
Some stretch goals have been identified in case more funds are raised than expected. These include hardcover copies for high tier contributors, more zines to be included in the Zine Compilation, and an animated short of any one of my ""A Gay Idiot"" comics.

Note: I'm situated in South Africa, therefore rewards that need to be shipped will incur additional charges as international mail is quite expensive to ship from South Africa. If you are able to ship the rewards using your own methods, please let me know. South African deliveries will be sent using PostNet (to your closest branch).
If you want to check out some of the art and portraits that I've done, you can check out my art-account on Instagram, @phillinthevoid.
 

Risks & Challenges
In terms of risks and challenges, there aren't that many. Most of them just revolve around timing, such as the timing for the book to go to the printers, timing around my planning around the weekend of Comic Con Africa, and so on.
Challenges, and respective contingencies include:


Ensuring enough funding is raised in time so that the printers get the book early enoughThe book, which mainly contains comics that are already done, is in the process of being compiled into a PDF for the printers. It will be finished within the first two weeks of the campaign. If enough funding has been raised at that point, the PDF will be sent ASAP to ensure the books are printed in time for Comic Con Africa.


Ensuring the book and other rewards are punctually delivered to contributorsThis is a more significant challenge for contributors that reside outside of South Africa. The most affordable way to send any items internationally is with PostNet (using services by Aramex), which uses a service without tracking numbers (as they ingest packages directly into the international postal stream). Should contributors want to use a service such as DHL (at an additional cost, but a tracking number is given), they can arrange with me to do so. South African packages will be sent using PostNet.


Planning the Comic Con Africa weekendI'm relying on funds in order to make sure the weekend goes as smoothly as possible, but if not enough funds are raised in order to do this, I have several contingencies which include staying with family or friends. This would heavily inconvenience them in their day to day routines, so I'm not entirely sure how reliable of an option this actually is.


Risks surrounding the book, and respective contingencies include:


Book QualityThe printing company I'm planning on using (Print On Demand), has a quick turnaround time and does do proof printing before completing the order. Therefore I am able to check that the book quality is up to standard and that I'm 100% happy with it.


Enough SupplyI'm starting with a small run initially in order to gauge interest in the book during the initial days of the campaign. If the campaign is successful I will be printing a run of 200 books. Luckily the printing company can speedily print more copies if the need arises.


These are the major risks and challenges currently on my mind for the campaign. Be assured that I will be transparent if any unexpected challenges should arise. Feel free to contact me with regards to any other concerns not directly addressed here.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Obviously, the best way to support my comic is by following it on Facebook, Instagram, Tapas and WebToon. Be sure to tell all your friends and family about the comic. Word of mouth is definitely the best kind of marketing.
You can also support me by contributing to my Patreon, where I post the comic 24 hours in advance, publish sketches and rejected ideas, and load video diaries, with more rewards to be introduced in the future.

Honestly...
This has been in the making for some time now. The comic is one of the most consistent things in my life. I have put a lot of my life into this endeavour. It might not be grand or mega-popular, but I'm proud of it. It's my baby. The comics are based on my life. Sometimes the comics are actually brutally honest, to the point where people have messaged me to check if I'm doing okay.
People have told me that I seem either desperate or overly depressing, but I didn't want to make a comic where everything is just sunshine and roses. Most gay-related webcomics (or at least the slice-of-life variety into which my comic falls) tend to focus on either happy normal relationships (that I don't have and cannot relate to at this point of my life) or an active sex life (hahahahahaha what is that??). My life will never be like what you see on instagram, and therefore I can only be myself, which I often make fun of in my comic.
I am super grateful for everyone who has supported me and my comic thus far. You all have no idea how much your support means to me. I love you, whoever you are. <3",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Greetings, my fellow babies! My name is Anthony Ball and I
am based out of Chicago, IL.  A comic
nerd all my life, after being dissatisfied with a lot of what I was reading  I decided to write my own books and I came up

We are in our infancy right now, and you, our supporters,

A LITTLE ABOUT DISCO
FRANKENSTEIN
DISCO FRANKENSTEIN - the evil
smashing, sucka trashing, party crashing man-monster private eye on a mission
to defend the south side of Chicago against crime, drugs, pimps, evil, freaks and
“The
Man” (Dr. Cletus Von Frankenstein). With his office above the
discotheque, Funk Mountain, this macho monster mack daddy has a taste for
action and a feel for the ladies. This book is my over the top homage / parody
of the old Universal monster movies
and the `70s-era disco music and Blaxploitation films that continues to
influence world culture to this day. 
In the first story of the series, Disco and his sidekick, Suga
(his five foot nothing secretary, right hand woman and professional better
half. An expert in weapons, explosives and hand to hand combat, She’s as
dangerous as she is pretty), will face off against the monstrous pimp, Mr.
Clyde. The alter ego of social
worker  Dr. Earnest Jekyll, Mr.
Clyde plots to become king pimp by consolidating or eliminating the competition
and forcing the very girls he saves during the day to work for him at night. 
Most of the problems in Disco and Suga’s lives will be the
result of “The Man’s” manipulative actions. Mad geneticist and redneck, Dr. Frankenstein
knows that it his destiny, his right, to rule the world. All he needs to
complete his plan is control of his great great grandfather’s creation. Working
from out of the shadows and utilizing his knowledge of science and the occult, the evil doctor will employ a number of associates such as WolfMane
(disco owner, smuggler and werewolf who has a luxurious perm in both his
forms), Prince A’lu Ca’lb (Blacula spelled backwards - resurrected once
again, the prince becomes obsessed with the ultra foxy Suga) and others like The
Creature of the Chicago River (a bomb designed to poison poor people
blows up in Tyree Pettiestone’s face, causing him to fall into the Chicago
River near a pile of toxic waste, transforming him into a hideous, lumbering
river monster), The Uptown Mummy (after their grandfather is killed in a
robbery, the Fayed brothers take matters into their own hands and resurrect him
as a rampaging mummy) and the previously mentioned Mr. Clyde to test his
theories and gather the materials needed to control Disco…or destroy him.
WHAT WE NEED THE MONEY FOR
The money raised from this effort will be used in three ways
- to pay for the printing and distribution of the incentive and submission
packages, printing larger runs of both comics so that I can distribute them personally,
expanding our market,  and to pay the
guys who put their talents and hearts into this. Furthermore, each donation can
be used as a kind of 'pre-order' that we can show larger distributors like

print runs and pre-order numbers are of course also possible even if we
don't hit the ultimate target, but the more we raise the better.

available that can meet any budget, and there’s even a sneak preview of our
other book, The Anointed!

<strong>5/31/12 </strong>With 8 days to go, we've hit benchmark number 2! TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS, GUYS! WHOO! Now, IndieGoogo doesn't list the numbers as a percentage, but just to let you know: 2k is 330% funding on this project. When I got the email today saying I'd reached that mark, I didn't know what to think. It's because of all you that I can print this book. Now I have the funds to do a REALLY GOOD print run, which doesn't just make my day, it makes my year. It makes my life. It might even make me cry. But enough of that. I just wanted to let you all know that you're awesome! From here on out, everyone purchasing at 15$ or above will also receive one of the printed buttons!<strong><br/></strong>

<div><strong><br/></strong></div>
<div>
<strong>05/12 update: </strong>Goal #2 is to raise 2,000 dollars. This means an offset print run with even better quality for the final book, and everyone receiving the book will get an additional print or pin. I know that seems like a lot, but if I get just 2 new 25$ contributos every day until the end of the campaign, we can do this! And any amount in between will go towards improving the print run or offsetting hosting costs for the comic. Thanks again, everyone!<strong><br/></strong>

<strong>05/09 Update:</strong> One of hte PDF's + May print has been claimed, so I can't change it now, but I want to let you all know.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Salutations! My name is Lauren Fleites, and I am the Editor-in-Chief and publicist for The Legend of the Fallen, a comic series in the making! Taking place in an abandoned human settlement called Atlantis, four lone kittens find themselves orphaned and on the run. Some cats want to help them, others want to harm them. And looming on the horizon is the fulfillment of a prophecy- four cats with immense power will either bathe the land in blood, or save it.</p>
<p><strong>Main Characters</strong></p>
<p><em>Spark: </em>Spark is a kind, generous, and polite young cat who'd make a good leader. He's willing to take the hit for those he cares about, much to the dismay and anger of his loved ones. <br/><br/><em>Mist: </em>Mist is a hot-headed kitten who tends to yell at others. She's tough and brutally honest, but she means well. Besides not taking no for an answer, she believes in trying as hard as possible to protect others. <br/><br/><em>Moon:</em> Moon is kind and caring, treasuring those she holds closest to her kitten heart. In fact, they're all she knows. If any of them were to die, a piece of her would go with them. As such, she tends to get furious if any of her loved ones take what she sees as unnecessary risks. Additionally, she experiences nightmares of those she loves disappearing, a product of her deepest fears.<br/><br/><em>Fire:</em> Fire is simple and almost even childish, his curiousity leading him into catastrophic problems. He thinks with his belly most of the time, but he can tell when others are upset, and will try to comfort them. But underneath the innocent exterior is another personality, one that takes over his body when he uses his special ability: this personality is cold, arrogant, and unsympathetic to those around him, even when they are hurt. Sometimes, however, he'll begrudgingly stick his neck out to help a cat in need.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our general goal for this project is $15,000. Our starving artists need to eat, you know! Don't worry, donators will be getting neat goodies out of their contributions, like personal thank-you notes, and even your name credited in our comics. With the money, we're hoping to have the first three of a projected ten issues completed, and even an animated trailer to bring in a bigger crowd for future fundraisers with even more rewards.</p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Salutations! My name is Lauren Fleites, and I am the Editor-in-Chief and publicist for The Legend of the Fallen, a comic series in the making! Taking place in an abandoned human settlement called Atlantis, four lone kittens find themselves orphaned and on the run. Some cats want to help them, others want to harm them. And looming on the horizon is the fulfillment of a prophecy- four cats with immense power will either bathe the land in blood, or save it.
Main Characters
Spark: Spark is a kind, generous, and polite young cat who'd make a good leader. He's willing to take the hit for those he cares about, much to the dismay and anger of his loved ones. Mist: Mist is a hot-headed kitten who tends to yell at others. She's tough and brutally honest, but she means well. Besides not taking no for an answer, she believes in trying as hard as possible to protect others. Moon: Moon is kind and caring, treasuring those she holds closest to her kitten heart. In fact, they're all she knows. If any of them were to die, a piece of her would go with them. As such, she tends to get furious if any of her loved ones take what she sees as unnecessary risks. Additionally, she experiences nightmares of those she loves disappearing, a product of her deepest fears.Fire: Fire is simple and almost even childish, his curiousity leading him into catastrophic problems. He thinks with his belly most of the time, but he can tell when others are upset, and will try to comfort them. But underneath the innocent exterior is another personality, one that takes over his body when he uses his special ability: this personality is cold, arrogant, and unsympathetic to those around him, even when they are hurt. Sometimes, however, he'll begrudgingly stick his neck out to help a cat in need.


What We Need & What You Get
Our general goal for this project is $15,000. Our starving artists need to eat, you know! Don't worry, donators will be getting neat goodies out of their contributions, like personal thank-you notes, and even your name credited in our comics. With the money, we're hoping to have the first three of a projected ten issues completed, and even an animated trailer to bring in a bigger crowd for future fundraisers with even more rewards.
