</div></div>","The Story...
My name is Sean Sullivan, I am a Northern California based professional photographer and filmmaker.  For more than 25 years I have been capturing imagery from some of the most stunning adventure destinations around the globe and sharing this imagery with the world through books, magazines, and websites.





I took a trip to Southern Belize in December 2015, the video posted above is from that trip.  Due to the short time frame of this campaign, we've chosen to post this as our video; in it we share some of the beautiful scenes that are so unique to this area.  BTW > Those who stick around to the end of the video will be rewarded with 3 minutes of cerebral sunrise tranquility recorded at the waters edge on French Louie Caye.  We include this here because this a big part of what makes this place so special and why it must be protected from those who wish to develop the area without forethought of how their actions effect the big picture here.



The Cause ...

As it seems with all pristine places, this region is under threat from all sides. We are hoping through this project to make a contribution towards the preservation of this sacred sanctuary.





In late 2015, with little fanfare or consultation with locals, the government of Belize signed a deal with Norwegian Cruise lines to allow their ships to dock at Harvest Caye 3 miles south of Placencia.  This region is renown for it pristine nature, Garifuna culture and the longest barrier reef in the Northern Hemisphere.

At times the cruise ships will bring as many as 4000 people A DAY to the area, and with them comes their garbage, human waste, and undoubtedly destruction to the pristine reef system that this part of the world is so known for.





The Mission ...

At the start of 2016 I was approached by members of a local Belizean conservation group known as the Placencia Fishermans Coop,   We talked about producing a series of short cultural narrative videos based around the local people and their environment.  From footage shot over the course of 2 weeks April 14-28, we will create a series of video pieces; each centered around a different aspect of Belizean experience.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m Jake. I have been exploring, practicing, learning and living the practices of Re-wilding and Natural Movement for the last 6 years of my life. Over those years I have been learning what it means to be truly alive, how to live in connection with my nature as a human animal and how to thrive in the modern world. There have been some underlying themes in my journey that have always brought me back to the idea of place-based, community-centric culture that honours humans as a natural and integral part of the ecosystem in which we live. I have discovered that we are a part of nature, and we require a symbiotic relationship with nature in order to thrive.</p>
<p>In my travels and exploration of these concepts, a strong vision and idea of what I want to create has come to me and inspires me in all that I do today. But I know that in order to turn this vision into a reality I will need help, I will need a community.</p>
<p>I envisage the re-aligning of our lives with the ancestral practice and lifestyle of place-based culture, where we live as an integral part within a greater ecosystem. The creation of such a community is a long process, but all great journeys start with one step. My one step is the creation of retreats that enable facilitators to share ancestral living skills such as hunting, gathering, natural movement, building, food processing, tanning, crafting, wrestling and so on in an immersive environment designed to empower participants with not only the skills they need to survive in life but also the community that will enable them to thrive. The main theme of these retreats will be re-wilding, natural movement and community, celebrating what it means to be fully alive as a wild, strong, free group of humans. This project is very much a community-based operation, I’m sure as you’re reading this you can think of thousands more ideas for what these retreats could look like and that is the point. I want to involve you in this process, this is not about an individual, it’s about a collective, moving towards a better way of life. I want you to help me, if you are reading this then you are in a unique position, you are aware that life can be fuller, richer, brighter and more vibrant, you seek a similar vision, and we both know that vision is turned to reality through collaboration.</p>
<p>I want you to reach out, share your ideas, connect and join me on this journey.</p>
<p>If you support this project here on Indiegogo, you will be contributing to the creation of the retreats and positively impacting participants lives and the natural community with which we will integrate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will need a decent amount of funding to get this off the ground, perks at the moment include early bird tickets to the first two retreats (Autumn and Spring 2021) and will soon include other options as we expand such as t-shirts and online courses.</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, funds will still be used to fund a smaller project that will still be focused on bringing together the aforementioned elements and creating a transformative experience while still being profitable.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Inevitably there will be challenge in getting this project off the ground. I feel blessed to have immense experience working and helping to create similar events around Australia. I feel confident in my ability to lead this project through to success and have many connections who are ready to help me make this happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, there are many ways in which you can help:</p>
<p>- Volunteer - help me set-up the event and the infrastructure required. If you have any experience with event organisation and set-up, promotion or any other skills you think might come in handy then please get in touch with me via Instagram (@move_wild) or email - jake@movewildcollective.com</p>
<p>- Facilitate - I am looking for people to help facilitate, whether that is background work in terms of mentoring and holding the community or at the forefront, teaching skills. If you are interested in facilitating at this retreat, please get in touch with me - Instagram (@move_wild) or email - jake@movewildcollective.com</p>
<p>- Promote - I will need many people who can help promote this event to get it out to more people. At the low-level if you could share this work that would be much appreciated in getting it out there. If you have skills in marketing, videography and promotion I would love to connect in order to get this retreat out to more people.

My earliest memories are of finding comfort and excitement in exploring the vibrant tropical garden of my home in Sri Lanka. By the time I was 8, I was an apartment-dweller in DC, but stories by people like Jane Goodall made me decide to protect nature when I grew up. </p><p>That goal stayed with me through graduate work at Yale and 9 years at Conservation International. I worked with inspiring people around the world and traveled to stunning places. But, what I gradually lost during this race against extinction was my optimism about the future of nature. I decided to switch to local environmental education. </p><p>But, I was still inundated with stories of species extinction, deforestation, coral reef bleaching, political corruption, and corporate irresponsibility. I spoke with many, many people who felt the same way. So, I decided to create a platform to share the successes of people who protect nature. I would use their stories to connect people to nature and to each other. </p><p>Welcome to Mayla: Matchmaking for Nature. </p><p>We are a mission-driven digital media company: we will build community online through creating, aggregating, and sharing uplifting stories about people around the world who protect nature. </p><p>But we are more than digital media. We will use technology to translate stories to action. For example, you read a story on Mayla about a James, a Samoan cleaning up the plastic pollution that threatens his nation’s reefs. Through our platform, you could donate to directly his organization, but you could also sign up to clean litter traps on the Anacostia River, or find a local grocery store that banned bottled water. In this way, Mayla is global and local. </p><p>No other organization does exactly what we intend to. There are many organizations that cover aspects of Mayla’s mission, and we see them as future partners. </p><p>We aim to grow a diverse global community of nature-protectors who create hope, find joy and work together to solve wicked environmental problems.</p><p>We launched our website on Earth Day and have been rapidly growing community and gathering story ideas through our Facebook group, attending events, and engaging our networks. Over the next few months, we will research the needs of potential customers and develop a range of proof-of-concept stories. As we gain traction, we will seek sponsors and investors.

<li>3 short documentaries that focus on people who protect nature. For example, team member Bill Finnegan is currently fundraising for a documentary on solar power that is tentatively called ""Power to the People,""</li>

But these figures belie that fact that there are huge problems in the Indian dairy industry. The fact that the average milk yield per cow per lactation in Europe, United States and Israel is about 6500kg, 11000kg, and 12000 kg respectively and in India it is only less than 900 kg, is a clear indication that the industry is not efficient and needs fixing.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549007433/mgbqj1l37un96rucfr5m.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Some might argue that in the western countries, the cows are more productive because of the more conducive cold weather prevalent there, but then you would be hard put to explain how the Israeli farmers, where the climate is even more arid and extreme than it is in India, with the desert temperatures soaring above 55<sup>o</sup>C in summer and below 5<sup>o</sup>C in winter, have a higher yield per cow per lactation.</p><p>The productivity of the farm animals in the Gulf countries, like in the UAE and in Saudi Arabia, where modern dairy management practices, proper housing, feed management, and higher-quality germplasm are standard, is also on par with the European countries. However, in India, because of the low animal productivity, not only is the costs of milk production, processing and marketing very high, the hygiene standards are low resulting in milk quality that is poor or sometimes even injurious to health.</p><p>There are four main aspects to Dairy farming:</p><ol>
<li value=""NaN"">Animal Management,</li>
<li value=""NaN"">Milk Production,</li>
<li value=""NaN"">Milk Processing, and</li>
<li value=""NaN"">Marketing &amp; Distribution,</li>
</ol><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549036632/dzskthqlq2oh7xs6ugpu.png"" src=""""/></p><p>In most developed countries, the same business entity oversees all four areas. In India, however, big and small key players of the dairy industry only undertake milk processing and marketing, leaving animal management and milk production to small-scale, unorganized farmers who view cattle rearing only as a supplementary activity. Put simply, Indian farmers do not view dairying as an independent profession. This leads to sub-par conditions, a lack of innovation, and low profits. These farmers are oblivious to the latest dairy management practices, which have revolutionized the dairy industry in other countries.</p><p>International standards dictate that milk must be chilled to below 4<sup>o</sup>C within 20 minutes of extraction from the cow’s udder as a safeguard against bacteria, ensuring and keeping the bacterial count to below 100,000 CFU/ml so that the milk is fit for human consumption. This unfortunately is not the case in India, where farmers milk the cows under unsanitary conditions and then transport it un-chilled to collection centres sometimes more than 12 hours later! The milk then gets delivered to processing facilities between 12 and 24 hours after collection. When the milk reaches the processing facilities, the bacteria count is more than 8 to 9 billion CFU/ml. Unscrupulous middlemen who use dangerous adulterants to dilute the milk are just one more hazard within the milk supply chain.</p><p>It is no accident that despite being the world’s largest producer, India contributes less than 0.1% to the world’s dairy market despite producing 150 million MT of milk. It is also worth noting that 45% of India’s agricultural produce, including dairy milk, goes to waste because of improper handling and a lack of cold chain storage facilities.

<br/><strong><u>Why we need your support</u></strong>
</h3><ul><li>
<p><strong>This is not a Greenfield project: </strong> This is a proven, tested and highly successful model in the world’s worst Geo-climatic conditions, in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. Doing it in India, with the most conducive conditions for dairy development where abundant green fodder and water is available and where the dairy market is growing at 16% CAGR  whilst the milk production is only growing at an annual rate of 4 % CAGR  will exacerbate the already acute mismatch between the demand and supply of milk creating more social problems.</p>
<p><strong>Minimal construction / implementation risk:</strong> The project is already under  construction and nearing completion and poised to enter the market  with its high quality products with 200 cows already on site . World-class free-stall animal housings are completed and ready to house 1200 cows. All state of the art plant &amp; machinery and equipment from China and Europe have been installed, tested and commissioned. All that is needed are more cows to make this project economically viable to enable it to sustain its massive social impact of feeding thousands of malnourished children.</p>
<p><strong>Replication potential:</strong> There is tremendous replication potential for such projects all over India as we could easily replicate such satellite dairy farms within every 50-100 km just around the area itself and even overseas impacting the rural folks of the major developing economies of Asia.</p>
<p><strong>By-product Revenues: </strong> All of the farm waste (manure &amp; fodder residue) will be converted into value added products viz. biogas, bio-fuel (CNG) &amp; bio-fertilizer and power generation proving the eco friendliness of the project and its ability to significantly impact the community at the same time. </p>
<p><strong>Dairy Management &amp; Consultancy potential:</strong> Within India, there is tremendous potential to educate, train and uplift the rural communities within the vicinity of such integrated farms  through the setting up of a dairy consultancy which in turn would spread the knowledge of dairying and improving lives </p>
<p><strong>Local Demand:</strong> There is tremendous demand for milk within and around Unnati’s farm area itself with the catchment area of some 3 million people who consume about 500,000 liters of milk per day. Our farm, at peak capacity can only supply 50,000 liters per day which is barely 10% of the total volume of consumption of Solapur, the nearest town. Milk and Yogurt demand cannot be fully satiated by our farm and hence we have a high degree of confidence in implementing our expansion plan and impacting millions.</p>
<p>“Agri-Project Management Co and Dairy Consultants” organization. We want to bring Indian dairy farming into the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>Our Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative: </strong> We have made it a primary goal of ours to donate a certain percentage of milk produced on each farm to orphanages and elderly homes local the farm. We are committed to donating at least 5000litres/ day in the beginning, which would provide 20,000 Children 200ml /day, satiating the daily nutritional protein needs of each child.</p>

But these figures belie that fact that there are huge problems in the Indian dairy industry. The fact that the average milk yield per cow per lactation in Europe, United States and Israel is about 6500kg, 11000kg, and 12000 kg respectively and in India it is only less than 900 kg, is a clear indication that the industry is not efficient and needs fixing.Some might argue that in the western countries, the cows are more productive because of the more conducive cold weather prevalent there, but then you would be hard put to explain how the Israeli farmers, where the climate is even more arid and extreme than it is in India, with the desert temperatures soaring above 55oC in summer and below 5oC in winter, have a higher yield per cow per lactation.The productivity of the farm animals in the Gulf countries, like in the UAE and in Saudi Arabia, where modern dairy management practices, proper housing, feed management, and higher-quality germplasm are standard, is also on par with the European countries. However, in India, because of the low animal productivity, not only is the costs of milk production, processing and marketing very high, the hygiene standards are low resulting in milk quality that is poor or sometimes even injurious to health.There are four main aspects to Dairy farming:
Animal Management,
Milk Production,
Milk Processing, and
Marketing & Distribution,
In most developed countries, the same business entity oversees all four areas. In India, however, big and small key players of the dairy industry only undertake milk processing and marketing, leaving animal management and milk production to small-scale, unorganized farmers who view cattle rearing only as a supplementary activity. Put simply, Indian farmers do not view dairying as an independent profession. This leads to sub-par conditions, a lack of innovation, and low profits. These farmers are oblivious to the latest dairy management practices, which have revolutionized the dairy industry in other countries.International standards dictate that milk must be chilled to below 4oC within 20 minutes of extraction from the cow’s udder as a safeguard against bacteria, ensuring and keeping the bacterial count to below 100,000 CFU/ml so that the milk is fit for human consumption. This unfortunately is not the case in India, where farmers milk the cows under unsanitary conditions and then transport it un-chilled to collection centres sometimes more than 12 hours later! The milk then gets delivered to processing facilities between 12 and 24 hours after collection. When the milk reaches the processing facilities, the bacteria count is more than 8 to 9 billion CFU/ml. Unscrupulous middlemen who use dangerous adulterants to dilute the milk are just one more hazard within the milk supply chain.It is no accident that despite being the world’s largest producer, India contributes less than 0.1% to the world’s dairy market despite producing 150 million MT of milk. It is also worth noting that 45% of India’s agricultural produce, including dairy milk, goes to waste because of improper handling and a lack of cold chain storage facilities. Considering the fact that nearly 25% of the world’s malnourished population (and more than 50% of the world’s malnourished children, 3,000 of them dying each day) reside in India, this situation is unacceptable.The Unnati SolutionAt Unnati Manz Biotec Dairy Farm Pvt Ltd, we believe we have a solution: our state-of-the-art Integrated Biotech Dairy Farm Project at Jewali(District of Osmanabad) Maharashtra, India.

<p><b>ABOUT THE PROJECT</b><br/></p><p>We
committed to create a <b>documentary film, “The Condor and The Eagle,” </b>that
weaves together the  story of 4 individuals (2 from the U.S. &amp; 2 from
Canada - 3 women and 1 man) who in their way take a stand against corporate
pollution, organizing communities where they live. Each person is involved in
the fights against the tar sands (Northern Gateway pipeline, KXL pipeline,
Houston refineries, oil tankers.) In 2015, they will travel to South America's
Amazon Rain Forest to meet Indigenous communities impacted by similar
extractive industries. </p>
<p>“The
Condor and The Eagle” is not the goal but the means to bring about change and <b>convince
people of the urgency to act NOW</b>! Therefore our project is a <b>call to
action:</b> to facilitate alliances and raise awareness on an international
level. It encourages people to join forces and work together (like our
key-people do) towards stopping the tar sands development. </p>
<p>Until now, we have managed to fund the first 10 months of
our journey in Canada and the U.S. following our four key-people where they
live &amp; their efforts to build bridges between local communities. In the
coming 10 months, we will fund and organize their trips to South America, facilitating
the creation of bonds and alliances with the local Indigenous communities. Our
project acknowledges the importance of <b>women leadership</b> and its
importance in this setting of an emerging climate movement to protect our
Mother Earth.  Thus, 3 of our 4 key-people are Indigenous women.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>The folowing issues will be addressed:</b></p>

<li>The rise of the environmental
     movement</li>

 out this inspiring Indigenous alliance initiative - bringing together 
Indigenous leaders from the North and from the South. We need the 
support of everybody and make sure that our brothers and sisters from 
the Amazon and North America grow this driving force we all need in the 
face of this climate chaos. We will all go to Paris for attending the last Climate Summit in December and ensure that the Indigenous delegations rise as those voices for change they are supposed to be. ""As
the industrial corporations push further and further their destructive
projects, destroy more and more Mother Earth, the people are now rising up.
From outside, it seems to be tragic; but from inside, a spiritual giant has
awakened. It is the reunion of the people that were already linked together. It
is a reunion beyond borders. It is a reunion around the world."" - Phil
Lane Jr. 
The
Takeoff Project aims to explore the solutions
available to the many impacts of industry’s expansion of “extreme” crude oil on
global and regional ecology and on the welfare of Indigenous communities. 
These funds will finance the trips of 4 indigenous environmental leaders from North
America to South America, facilitating the creation of bonds and alliances with
the local Indigenous communities.

ABOUT
US
We
are French and German filmmakers/community organizers
with backgrounds in sociology, media and health. We took-off in April 2014 from
Europe on a 1 and 1/2 year trip that will take us to 5 countries: USA, Canada, Ecuador, Peru
& Chile. 
We
reached a point in our lives where we felt that we could no longer keep our
eyes closed as if our future, and that of our children was not on the line. We
began to see the world more clearly, becoming more aware of the injustices that
are going on in the world. During our awakening, we witnessed an incredible
movement building and being led by indigenous people and wanted to support
their efforts. When you are aware, you have a responsibility to act. 
We
made it our mission to let the world know about the commitment and work of all
the inspirational worriors that stand against extractive industries. We want to
show their positive approach of building strong bonds all over the world in
order to reach their goal to ""leave the oil in the ground"".
For
many years we watched many environmental disasters as a result of extractive
industries. When we heard about the Tar Sands we knew it was time to act. We
quit our jobs, took our ten years savings and began our journey to North
America. Canada’s
tar sands operations are a global environmental disaster with more
than 140,000 km² total exploitable reserves — an area larger than England. Tar
sands is the biggest energy project in the world, currently producing 1.9
million barrels of oil a day.  The impact of the Alberta tar sands on
local First Nations communities is devastating, but this massive extractive
industry is a concern for communities all over North America and the entire
globe.
ABOUT THE PROJECTWe

weaves together the  story of 4 individuals (2 from the U.S. & 2 from

pollution, organizing communities where they live. Each person is involved in
the fights against the tar sands (Northern Gateway pipeline, KXL pipeline,
Houston refineries, oil tankers.) In 2015, they will travel to South America's
Amazon Rain Forest to meet Indigenous communities impacted by similar
extractive industries. 
“The

The rise of the environmental
     movement
Continued Indian genocide caused
     by the modern industrial projects
Climate Change
Intercultural Awareness
Women’s Leadership
Rights of Nature
Community Organizing Strategies


The key-people will achieve the following in South America:

Partnerships with youth
     organizations in Ecuador/Peru organized by the youth and for the youth
Bonds and alliances while working
     on the creation of a women treaty between Indigenous women from the North
     and the South
Awareness on Yasuni National Park
     sellout to petrochemical extractive industries

</h3> <p>Hello Everyone, my name is David M. Champion, Vice President of Stormweapon Defense Systems, LLC. It is my honor and pleasure to present to you several facts pertaining to our proposed Anti-Hurricane Weapon System. This second Indiegogo campaign we are bringing to you is intended to raise the necessary funds to take the project to the next level. We sincerely hope that you will consider assisting us in our pursuit to save human life and our precious environment from the ravages of these future killer-hurricanes.</p>
<p>We have estimated the expenses that are necessary to advance our project to the next level, and in a brief break-down they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customized Super Computer, built in house by myself and my team.<br/>
</li>
<li>New Operations Center, portable and self-sufficient.</li>
<li>Travel and Consultations, meetings with the DOD, selected drone manufacturers, and other Defense Contractors in the USA. Other agencies include NASA, NOAA, The National Hurricane Center, and a host of other weather-related  tracking agencies necessary for our project. <br/>
</li>
<li>Travel to foreign countries like Japan, who has already shown interest in protecting its citizens and families from the death and destruction caused by the killer-typhoons in that region of the world.<br/>
</li>
<li>Wrap up first phase consultations with our five-person selected scientific team. <br/>
</li>
</ul>We must immediately proceed with the major project funding which allows us to begin construction on <b>Project S.I.A.D.</b>. Of course we have had many obstacles in the past 12 years of this project, mainly financial, but we have supported it with every dollar we could muster and now we need your help to get it constructed and operating! <br/>Our goals are to never again lose another innocent life from these killer storms, or lose our homes and jobs because they were eradicated within hours.

The African People & Wildlife Fund's scholarships give the Maasai Steppe's best and brightest children the chance to receive a private secondary school education. In this sweeping, rural landscape, most families cannot afford to educate their children beyond Tanzania's free educational limits (up to grade 6).  APW gives rural Tanzanians who are living side-by-side with wild predators (such as the highly-threatened African Lion) the chance to benefit from wildlife presence.These children earn their scholarships through significant participation in our conservation education after-school programs and environmental summer camps. They have demonstrated a commitment to their community and to the natural world. They want to become the future environmental leaders of Tanzania - and you can help make it happen!

</div><h3><span>Short Summary</span></h3><p>Hello my name is Ben Micek. I represent a Colorado  nonprofit specializing  in community based ecological restoration, sustainable food production, and community empowerment through classes, workshops, and demonstration sites. Our project, the Turtle Island Ecology Center is a grassland and Bison restoration project, and Organic Permaculture farm in the High Plains of Northern  Colorado.</p><p> In 2012, I had the wonderful opportunity to study Ecological Restoration and Conservation Biology in Southern Chile and instantly fell in love with the ancient Alerce forests, the turquoise  waters, and the local culture. That is why I keep going back! <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But this time when I return I am ready to get to work, and with a lot of help from my friends, we aim to reforest a 50 acre piece of land at the base of the extinct Hornopíren volcano that borders the mighty Rio Negro (black river) and create an Ecovillage.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We plan to plant a forest with seedlings of the ancient Alerce tree, and other threatened species, and simultaneously develop an Ecovillage, Hostel, and Education Center. Known as the ""Redwoods of South America"", the Alerce trees rival the Redwood in stature and are the second oldest known living tree on Earth (3600 years), and are also one of the most threatened. They were nearly wiped out in the Hornopiren area in the past 100 years due to excessive logging and their  numbers are still dwindling. A similar fate to that of their cousins, the Redwoods.</span></p><p>Now an ambitious project like this must need some serious manpower, and that's why the human community is so important to the project. We hope to raise a portion of the funding through our friends, family, and the wider crowd-funding community, and we are dependent on the ideas and physical labor of our local community, the Ecovillage. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Nestled between the newly planted Alerce seedlings will be a small and bustling community adorned with tree houses, cabins, gardens, ponds, and community areas with an eclectic and diverse family of people living simply, growing an abundance of fresh food, and treading lightly on the earth.</span></p><p>Mother Earth needs our help and there is lots of work to do. However, many hands make light work. And that is where the community  comes into play, the human community!</p><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Our goal is to acquire enough funds to purchase a 51 acre piece of land outside of the small fishing village of Hornopiren, Chile. The property is tucked between Hornopiren National Park and the coastal fjords of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>The property costs roughly $73,000 including attorney fees. The land includes nearly 200 meters of the Rio Negro, with world class fly fishing and kayaking. The great news is that we have raised a good chunk of the funds and are hoping to raise the remaining $ 20,000 through crowd-funding. Any additional funds raised will  be put towards much needed basic infrastructure such as compost toilets, aquaponics, greenhouses, lodging, and gardens:)</p><p>What we can give in return is access to and lodging in one of the world's most beautiful and scenic places. Come relax in a beautiful and charming house that is a century old and still as good as new. Or camp out in an enchanted forest under the stars. Listen to the sounds of the many year round streams on the property and drink the pure, cool water right from the stream. Walk down to the river through the bamboo, moss, and fern lined paths. Hornopiren National Park borders the property, where you can see one of the last remaining ancient groves of Alerce trees, with many trees older than Jesus. </p><p>Hike 3 days down the Rio Puelo to El Bolson Argentina, a beautiful bohemian mountain town that hippies flocked to in the 70's, with it's vibrant mix of ex-pats, breweries, hiking trails, and organic farms. Explore the coastal fjords of Southern Chile. Kayak from the property out to the Gulf of Ancud and explore the Comau Fjord where you can see dolphins, blue whales, orcas, humpback whales, fin back whales, sperm whales, and penguins. Visit nearby islands and Pumalin Park, the world's largest  privately owned nature preserve, and soak in one of the many natural hot springs. Fly fish for giant salmon and trout in the Rio Negro and nearby Rio Blanco or the many glacial lakes, or try your hand at deep sea fishing In the Pacific.</p><p>All investors can come and visit, with access to community kayaks, fishing gear, and community facilities, and watch the community grow! However there are wonderful perks listed for different levels of donations. </p><br/><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Our vision is a full time community of people sharing a common goal of restoring the landscape in which we live, while crating a safe, healthy, supportive, and abundant community. The Ecovillage can be a  hub for travelers, designers, artists, musicians, teachers, farmers, the indigenous, elders, and people of all ages. </p><p>The property is in prime location to make a positive impact. Hornopiren is known as the Northern gate to Patagonia, as it is where the Southern Highway ends and ferries head south to where the road starts again towards Patagonia. Our Eco Hostel will attract Chilean and International travelers on their way into Patagonia. Ecotourism opportunities abound. With kayaking the fjords, Rio Negro, and Rio Blanco, horseback riding, guided hiking into Pumalin and Hornopiren Parks, guided flyfishing and flyfishing lodge, deep sea fishing, hostel, campgrounds, and tours to the hot springs we will provide income for the community. Nearby fishing lodges in the area charge upwards to $7,000 USD <b>per week</b> for guided fishing with lodging.</p><p>We aim to educate the local community, travelers, interns, and volunteers  in sustainable agriculture, permaculture, indigenous wisdom and traditional ecological knowledge, ecological design, forest ecology, ecological restoration, appropriate technologies, and most importantly we will create a space were we can honor Mother Earth and be a lasting example of positive change.</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>This has been a long time in the making since I first visited Chile, and the help I have received along the way has been unbelievable and very appreciated. Through my connections made while studying in Conservacion Patagonica, I had the privilege of receiving assistance from the founder of Pumalin Park in finding a property in the desired area, as well as finding qualified legal assistance in Chile to make the purchase. With this assistance  our risks and concerns have been greatly reduced. The title of the property has been cleared by our attorney in Chile and as of now we are ready to proceed with the purchase. </p><p>Chile is a country with a booming economy, high quality of life, abundance of natural resources, and WATER. I feel like the biggest challenge has been raising the funds. Once we have the property, we have access to tree seedlings, vegetable seed, fruit trees, berry bushes, beehives, farm animals, and local knowledge, through the connections I have made in my previous travels. We are set up for success and just need your help!</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Please share this campaign with someone who may be interested in supporting our project. Many hands make light work! If you are interested in sustainable agriculture, aquaponics, permaculture, or ecological restoration, please come volunteer and see what it takes to envision, design, and create a community from the ground up.</p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryHello my name is Ben Micek.

A similar fate to that of their cousins, the Redwoods.Now an ambitious project like this must need some serious manpower, and that's why the human community is so important to the project. We hope to raise a portion of the funding through our friends, family, and the wider crowd-funding community, and we are dependent on the ideas and physical labor of our local community, the Ecovillage. Nestled between the newly planted Alerce seedlings will be a small and bustling community adorned with tree houses, cabins, gardens, ponds, and community areas with an eclectic and diverse family of people living simply, growing an abundance of fresh food, and treading lightly on the earth.Mother Earth needs our help and there is lots of work to do. However, many hands make light work. And that is where the community  comes into play, the human community!What We Need & What You GetOur goal is to acquire enough funds to purchase a 51 acre piece of land outside of the small fishing village of Hornopiren, Chile. The property is tucked between Hornopiren National Park and the coastal fjords of the Pacific Ocean.The property costs roughly $73,000 including attorney fees. The land includes nearly 200 meters of the Rio Negro, with world class fly fishing and kayaking. The great news is that we have raised a good chunk of the funds and are hoping to raise the remaining $ 20,000 through crowd-funding. Any additional funds raised will  be put towards much needed basic infrastructure such as compost toilets, aquaponics, greenhouses, lodging, and gardens:)What we can give in return is access to and lodging in one of the world's most beautiful and scenic places. Come relax in a beautiful and charming house that is a century old and still as good as new. Or camp out in an enchanted forest under the stars. Listen to the sounds of the many year round streams on the property and drink the pure, cool water right from the stream. Walk down to the river through the bamboo, moss, and fern lined paths. Hornopiren National Park borders the property, where you can see one of the last remaining ancient groves of Alerce trees, with many trees older than Jesus. Hike 3 days down the Rio Puelo to El Bolson Argentina, a beautiful bohemian mountain town that hippies flocked to in the 70's, with it's vibrant mix of ex-pats, breweries, hiking trails, and organic farms. Explore the coastal fjords of Southern Chile. Kayak from the property out to the Gulf of Ancud and explore the Comau Fjord where you can see dolphins, blue whales, orcas, humpback whales, fin back whales, sperm whales, and penguins. Visit nearby islands and Pumalin Park, the world's largest  privately owned nature preserve, and soak in one of the many natural hot springs. Fly fish for giant salmon and trout in the Rio Negro and nearby Rio Blanco or the many glacial lakes, or try your hand at deep sea fishing In the Pacific.All investors can come and visit, with access to community kayaks, fishing gear, and community facilities, and watch the community grow! However there are wonderful perks listed for different levels of donations. The ImpactOur vision is a full time community of people sharing a common goal of restoring the landscape in which we live, while crating a safe, healthy, supportive, and abundant community. The Ecovillage can be a  hub for travelers, designers, artists, musicians, teachers, farmers, the indigenous, elders, and people of all ages. The property is in prime location to make a positive impact. Hornopiren is known as the Northern gate to Patagonia, as it is where the Southern Highway ends and ferries head south to where the road starts again towards Patagonia. Our Eco Hostel will attract Chilean and International travelers on their way into Patagonia. Ecotourism opportunities abound. With kayaking the fjords, Rio Negro, and Rio Blanco, horseback riding, guided hiking into Pumalin and Hornopiren Parks, guided flyfishing and flyfishing lodge, deep sea fishing, hostel, campgrounds, and tours to the hot springs we will provide income for the community. Nearby fishing lodges in the area charge upwards to $7,000 USD per week for guided fishing with lodging.We aim to educate the local community, travelers, interns, and volunteers  in sustainable agriculture, permaculture, indigenous wisdom and traditional ecological knowledge, ecological design, forest ecology, ecological restoration, appropriate technologies, and most importantly we will create a space were we can honor Mother Earth and be a lasting example of positive change.Risks & ChallengesThis has been a long time in the making since I first visited Chile, and the help I have received along the way has been unbelievable and very appreciated. Through my connections made while studying in Conservacion Patagonica, I had the privilege of receiving assistance from the founder of Pumalin Park in finding a property in the desired area, as well as finding qualified legal assistance in Chile to make the purchase. With this assistance  our risks and concerns have been greatly reduced. The title of the property has been cleared by our attorney in Chile and as of now we are ready to proceed with the purchase. Chile is a country with a booming economy, high quality of life, abundance of natural resources, and WATER. I feel like the biggest challenge has been raising the funds. Once we have the property, we have access to tree seedlings, vegetable seed, fruit trees, berry bushes, beehives, farm animals, and local knowledge, through the connections I have made in my previous travels. We are set up for success and just need your help!Other Ways You Can HelpPlease share this campaign with someone who may be interested in supporting our project. Many hands make light work! If you are interested in sustainable agriculture, aquaponics, permaculture, or ecological restoration, please come volunteer and see what it takes to envision, design, and create a community from the ground up.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

been a great success for the last 10 years - they provide an economic, healthy

everybody has a right to live in a comfortable house that is beneficial to our

<p>To achieve this we need to produce the
straw panels closer to you. But this is only possible if we can <b>engineer
more efficient production machinery!</b> Only by heavily investing into the
development of a new generation of machinery can we increase production
efficiency by a factor of four, and take straw bale construction to the next
level.</p>
<p>Your support will make it possible to
develop highly efficient production machinery for local and regional
production. Your support has the potential to save tons of CO2 and primary
energy, both during construction and use of the building. You will not only be
helping us all, but make the World a better place at the same time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>
</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>How much CO2 can I save with my
support?</b></p>
<p>On average a straw panel house (140m2 wall surface) sequesters more than 10t of
CO2, even after including 500km road transport to the building site. And there
will be savings of approx. 50t of CO2 over the next 50 years by reducing the
energy needed for heating and/or cooling, compared even to a low energy house.</p>
<p>Our annual production of panels for 35
houses saves 350t of CO2 through sequestering, and another 1750t of CO2 during
the next 50 years. But we want our production to do better - with a possible
150 houses a year for each new and efficient production site, we will sequester
1500t of CO2 a year and achieve savings of 7500t of CO2 in the future.</p>
<p>If we had only 10 production sites
running for 10 years, the cumulated sequestered CO2 would amount to staggering
150'000t and the long term CO2 savings to another 750'000t.</p>
<p></p><p><b>What will we use your donations for?</b></p><p>We
hope to raise 450’000€ to cover all steps listed below. That means every € you
donate has the potential to save 2t of CO2! </p>
<p></p><p>To
move closer to our overall goal we split the process into few stages:</p>
<p>1. Development of a new,
efficient production line</p>
<p>For this stage we need
just 180’000€. This is our primary objective for this Indiegogo
project.</p>
<p>If we raise more funds, we
will continue with step 2 and 3:</p>
<p>2. Certification of
machinery so it can be sold in other countries</p>
<p>3. Help finance one or
more production lines in other countries</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Even if we

<p>We believe everybody has a right to live in a
comfortable house that is beneficial to our environment. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Many pay very high prices for very
low quality buildings – straw panel houses provide high thermal comfort in

Please donate if you think independence of fossil fuels make the World a safer place to be!</span></b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Straw, wood and clay are abundant all over the World –
by applying these in an efficient way we can lower the dependency from fossil
fuels and make the World a much safer place to be.</span></p>
<p><b>4.  Please donate if you want straw bale building to go mainstream!</b>.</p>
<p>In France large 7 story
appartments and schools are built with straw as insulation. No wonder:  Straw panels are earthquake safe,  provide good insulation and achieve 120min
fire protection when plastered with clay.</p>
<p><b>5.<span> 
</span><span></span>Please donate if you think earthquake safe buildings should not only be made from concrete</b>!</p>
<p>In the earthquake zones, straw houses have an
advantage - flexibility of construction. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Straw panels can take more
than the calculated loads on the wooden construction. Compressed straw is load
bearing and flexible, providing exceptional security in earthquake zones.</span></p>

existing production technology demands a lot of manual work. The efficiency is
not high. The 13 highly motivated employees in production can annually produce
panels for up to 50 houses. Labor increases the price of the panel and the
production line is for the moment too inefficient to be used in countries with
higher wages. But if we want to save energy and build ecologically, a solution
must be found to produce more houses efficiently.</p>
<p>The
concept for the new technology line lets us produce panels for 150 houses per
year with just 8 people working. The production line would be fairly simple and
due to certified machinery, production could be spread to other countries. In
this way our healthy and beneficial product could spread to a place closer to
you and help create many new working facilities all over the world. This will
help to protect our environment in the long term.</p>
<p>The
technology would be fairly simple and would not require large investment. Low
energy consumption during production and the exclusive use of renewable
materials is a great start for a healthy and ecological product - a product
that saves energy and provides comfort to people. And most importantly, due to
widely available resources used in production – it can be
located anywhere. </p>
<p>Now
production is based in Lithuania and this is the only factory – but
this situation will be changed with your help. The new production lines will
provide new opportunities on the labor market and support a network of small
companies that care about the environment.</p>

<p><b>History
of straw houses</b></p>
<p>When people hear about straw houses they often remember the
fairy-tale about The Three Pigs. In the fairy-tale the ending was not so happy,
but in reality straw houses are strong and warm buildings. People have been
building straw houses since the 19th century. The oldest straw house in Europe
is in Montargis in France – built
in 1921. In the USA in Nebraska, the oldest straw building in the world is more
than 110 years old.</p>
<p>Straw building techniques have moved forward and it was proved that
straw houses are very warm and fire resistant. These kind of buildings could
easily compete with bricks houses and log houses and became a serious
alternative in traditional building industry. Even in the earthquake zones,
straw houses have an advantage – practice showed that during the earthquakes
in China and Pakistan straw houses were not destroyed because of the
flexibility of construction.</p>
<p><b>Ecococon straw panels</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ecococon team has created a unique method for pressing straw
into a frame to produce straight, high quality panels.  The beginning was not easy at all, and only
after spending many years with research and trials a technology was developed
that lets us produce high quality straw panels. </p>
<p>The main goal was to create technology which could provide more
environmentally friendly houses. Our panels are from natural materials, no
chemical components are included. Straw is a building material that is
plentiful. By using renewable materials no harm is made to the environment. In
2013, during the participation in Cradle to Cradle competition, Ecococon straw
panels were listed as one of the top 10 most ecological and innovative building
products in the world <a href=""http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/design_innovation/10-finalists-cradle-cradle-product-innovation-challenge-show-what%E2%80%99s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/design_innovation/10-finalists-cradle-cradle-product-innovation-challenge-show-what’s</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ecococon is a modular building system which assembly is very quick
and precise – you can see the building process <a href=""http://www.ecococon.lt/english/straw-panels/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.ecococon.lt/english/straw-panels/</span></a>  With the provided numbered parts and
drawings, a middle sized house can be built in 2-3 days using just simple tools.
</p>
<p>Panels are produced with very little embodied energy. Even more
important, its excellent U-value and heat retaining characteristics will save
energy for heating and cooling throughout the lifetime of the building. Your
savings will also reduce global warming emissions.</p>
<p>The thermal resistance of the straw panels are 0,056 W/mK with a
resulting overall U-value of 0,107 W/m<sup>2</sup>K (R=9.3), including the 60-
100mm wood fibre board on the outside. </p>
<p>The formidable insulation value of the wall can be sufficient to
achieve Passive house standard.The passive house Standard does not only
achieve low energy consumption, but increases the quality and durability of the
building. It ensures also a much higher living comfort.</p>
<p>Straw panels are being produced according to
each project individually. The uniqueness of the technology is the
implementation of any kind of house design, any project can be built with straw
panels. Panels can be individually produced with 40-120cm width and 40-300cm
height. Load bearing lintels, inclined tops and braced corners are also
possible without a change of materials. The thickness of 40cm is standard.  </p>
<p>Straw panels let people create a healthy and
ecological atmosphere in their living area. For inside walls, clay plaster
creates a great microclimate. </p>

<p><b>Visi
norime gyventi sveikoje aplinkoje. Mes sukūrėme unikalią šiaudų statybos
technologiją. Jūsų parama padės plėtoti gamybą ir sukelti revoliuciją statybos
pramonėje. </b>Būkite šios plėtros dalimi!</p>
<p>Šiaudų skydai per pastaruosius 10 metų labai
išpopuliarėjo – jie įnešė ekonominį, sveiką ir labai reikalingą ekologišką
indėlį statybų pramonėje. Mes tikime, jog kiekvienas turi teisę gyventi
jaukiame name, kuris nesukelia žalos aplinkai.</p>
<p>Jūsų parama suteiks galimybę plėtoti efektyvios
gamybos įrenginius vietinei ir užsienio gamybai. Jūs ne tik padėsite mums,
tačiau ir padarysite pasaulį geresne ir švaresne vieta gyventi.</p>
<p><b>Kam
bus panaudota jūsų parama?</b></p>
<p>Mes tikimės surinkti 450’000€ įgyvendinti
žemiau pateiktiems žingsniams. Tai reiškia, kad kiekvienas €, kuriuo jūs
paremiate turi potencialą išsaugoti 2t CO2.</p>
<p>Norėdami priartėti prie pagrindinio tikslo, procesą
suskirstėme etapais:</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>Naujos efektyvios gamybos linijos plėtojimas</p>
<p>Šiame etape reikalinga suma 180’000€. Tai
yra mūsų pagrindinis tikslas šiame Indiegogo projekte. </p>
<p>Jei
surinksime daugiau, plėtosime 2 ir 3 etapus:</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>Įrangos
sertifikavimas, kad galima būtų ją realizuoti kitose šalyse.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>Padėti
finansuoti vieną ar kelias gamybos linijas kitose šalyse. </p>
<p>Jei
mes pasieksime mažiau, galėsime pradėti įgyvendinti savo tikslus, tik tai užims
daugiau laiko. </p>
<p>Mums reikalinga jūsų pagalba išvystyti gamybos
technologijai ir pradėti naują gamybinę liniją. Skaitykite plačiau žemiau bei
mūsų internetinėje svetainėje <a href=""http://www.ecococon.lt"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.ecococon.lt</span></a> kilus klausimams mielai į
juos atsakysime.</p>
<p>Daugiau priežasčių mus paremti:</p>
<p>1. 
Jei manote, kad statybų
sektoriuje reikalinga alternatyva. </p>
<p>Šiaudų skydai įnešė ekonominį, sveiką ir labai
reikalingą ekologinį indėlį statybų sektoriuje. Žvelgiant pasauliniu
mąstu statybų pramonė yra atsakinga už beveik 40% CO2 išskyrimą pačių statybų
metu bei šildant ir vėdinant pastatus. Su šiuolaikinėmis technologijomis ir prieinamomis
natūraliomis medžiagomis ši tarša gali būti ženkliai sumažinta. </p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>Jei
norite padaryti teigiamą poveikį žmonių gyvenimo kokybei.</p>
<p>Mes tikime, kad
kiekvienas turi teisę gyventi jaukiame name, kuris neturi neigiamo poveikio
aplinkai.Daugelis
moka didelę kainą už labai žemą pastatų kokybę – šiaudų skydų namai suteikia
aukšto lygio komfortą tiek vasarą, tiek žiemą be žalos aplinkai.</p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>Jei manote, kad šiaudiniai namai turi plisti.</p>
<p>Prancūzijoje didelis 7 aukštų pastatas bei mokyklos yra statomos
naudojant šiaudus kaip apšiltinamąją medžiagą. Nieko keisto: šiaudų skydai yra
atsparūs žemės drebėjimams, pasižymi gera šilumos izoliacija bei siekia 120
minučių gaisro atsparumą jei yra nutinkuoti molio tinku. </p>
<p>4.  Jei manote, kad atsparūs žemės drebėjimams
namai turi būti statomi ne tik iš betono.</p>
<p>Zonose, kuriose gausu žemės drebėjimų, šiaudiniai namai turi privalumą –
konstrukcijos lankstumą. Šiaudų skydai atlaiko didesnes apkrovas nei
apskaičiuotos medinių konstrukcijų apkrovos. Suspausti šiaudų skydai yra
laikančioji ir tuo pačiu lanksti konstrukcija, suteikianti išskirtinį saugumą
žemės drebėjimų zonose.</p>
<p>5.  Jei manote, kad pasyvūs namai turi būti iš natūralių
medžiagų.</p>
<p>2016 metais planuojamas Ecococon sienų sistemos sertifikavimas Pasyvaus
namo sertifikatu. Architektai lengvai gali pasiekti pasyvaus namo standartą
naudodami natūralias medžiagas.</p>
<p>6.  Jei manote, kad ekologiškumas svarbu.</p>
<p>Ecococon šiaudų skydai pateko į top 10 ekologiškiausių ir inovatyviausių
produktų visame pasaulyje. Ecococon skydai pateko tarp 10 finalistų Cradle to
Cradle inovacijų konkurse. 2016 metais tikimės pasiekti Cradle to Cradle
sertifikavimą, kas pagrįs produkto ekologiškumą. </p>
<p>7.  Jei manote, kad ekonomiškai efektyvi statyba
yra svarbi.</p>
<p>Ecococon yra modulinė statybos sistema, kurios surinkimas yra greitas ir
tikslus. Ar įmanoma pastatyti 400 m2 namą per tris dienas? Tai padarė Šveicarai
su 318 m2 Ecococon šiaudų skydų. Konstrukcijos dėka, statybos yra produktyvios
ir ekonomiškai efektyvios – ypač šalyse su brangia darbo jėga. </p>
<p>8.  Jei manote, kad architektūrinė laisvė
svarbi.</p>
<p>Jokių dizaino apribojimų! Visų tipų dizainai gali būti įgyvendinti
naudojant skirtingo dydžio skydus pagamintus pagal individualų projektą.
Architektai turi visišką laisvę projektavimui. </p>
<p>9.  Jei jums rūpi jūsų sveikata.</p>
<p>Gyvenkite
sveikuose namuose. Šiaudų skydai su molio tinku leidžia sukurti sveiką ir
ekologišką vidaus dizainą. Nėra nieko svarbiau nei mūsų sveikata. Šiandieninė
statyba gali turėti iki 50000 medžiagų, kurių didžioji dalis net nebuvo tirta
dėl toksinų. </p>

<p><i>Costruire con pannelli di
paglia!</i></p>
<p><i>Ogni euro donato salva 2
tonnellate di CO2. Contribuisci a rivoluzionare l’edilizia!</i></p>
<p><i>In media una casa
costruita con pannelli di paglia (circa 140 mq di superficie muro) incamera più
di 10 tonnellate di CO2, anche dopo aver effettuato 500 km di trasporto su
strada verso il cantiere.</i></p>
<p><i>Inoltre ci sarà un
risparmio di circa 50 t di CO2 nei prossimi 50 anni, riducendo l’energia
necessaria per il riscaldamento e raffrescamento.</i></p>
<p><i>Se vi interessa ridurre le
emissioni di CO2, siete pregati di donare!!</i></p>
<p>Tutti vogliono vivere in un ambiente sano. Abbiamo una
tecnologia costruttiva unica utillizzando la paglia. La tua donazione aiuterebbe
a sviluppare una produzione efficiente rivoluzionando l'industria edilizia. Fai
parte di questo sviluppo!<br/>
<br/>
I nostri elementi di paglia modulari sono stati un grande successo negli ultimi
10 anni, forniscono una soluzione ecologica economica, sana e assolutamente
necessaria per l'industria delle costruzioni. Crediamo che tutti hanno il
diritto di vivere in una casa confortevole con il beneficio per il nostro
ambiente.<br/>
<br/>
Per raggiungere questo obiettivo abbiamo bisogno di produrre pannelli di paglia
più vicino a noi. Tutto questo è possibile solo se progettiamo macchinari di
produzione più efficienti!</p>
<p>Solo investendo pesantemente nello sviluppo di una nuova
generazione di macchine possiamo aumentare l'efficienza della produzione.<br/>
Con il vostro supporto si potranno sviluppare macchine di produzione ad alta
efficienza per la produzione locale e regionale. Un enorme potenziale per
salvare tonnellate di CO2 e di energia primaria, sia in fase di costruzione e
durante l'utilizzo dell'edificio. Non sarà solo per aiutare tutti noi, ma
rendere il mondo un posto migliore.<br/>
<br/>
<i><br/>
Quanta CO2 posso risparmiare con il mio supporto?</i><br/>
<br/>
La produzione annuale di pannelli per 35 case consente di risparmiare 350t di
CO2, e altre  1750t di CO2 nel corso dei
prossimi 50 anni. Ma noi vogliamo fare meglio - con 150 case all'anno per ogni
nuovo ed efficiente sito produttivo, saranno risparmiate 1500t di CO2 all'anno
e otterremmo un risparmio di 7500t di CO2 nel futuro.<br/>
<br/>
Se avessimo solo 10 siti produttivi in ​​esecuzione per 10 anni, la CO2
cumulato sarebbe pari a 150'000t  (sconcertante!)
e il risparmio di CO2 a lungo termine ad altre 750'000t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come utilizzeremo le vostre donazioni ?<br/>
<br/>
Speriamo di raccogliere € 450'000  per
coprire tutti i passaggi elencati di seguito. Ciò significa che ogni € donato
ha il potenziale di salvare 2t di CO2!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Per avvicinarsi al nostro obiettivo generale abbiamo diviso il processo in alcune
fasi:<br/>
<br/>
1. Sviluppo di una nuova, efficiente linea di produzione; <br/>
Per questa fase abbiamo bisogno solo € 180'000. Questo è il nostro obiettivo
primario per questo progetto chiamato Indiegogo.<br/>
<br/>
Se riceveremo più fondi, continueremo con la fase 2 e 3:<br/>
<br/>
2. La certificazione delle macchine in modo che possa essere venduto in altri
paesi<br/>
<br/>
3. contribuire a finanziare una o più linee di produzione in altri paesi<br/>
<br/>
Anche se otteniamo meno, saremo in grado di raggiungere questi obiettivi, solo
ci vorrà un po’ più di tempo. E crediamo fortemente che il mondo non può più
permettersi di aspettare!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto per sviluppare la nostra tecnologia di
produzione e iniziare una nuova linea di produzione. Ci auguriamo che ti
soddisfi il nostro pensiero di risparmio energetico e la creazione di modi di
salvare l'ambiente. Leggi i dettagli di seguito e sul nostro sito web
<a href=""http://www.ecococon.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ecococon.eu</a> e saremo lieti di rispondere a tutte le vostre domande.</p>
<p>Hai bisogno di eventuali ulteriori motivi  per donare? Eccoli:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Si prega di donare se si pensa che il settore delle costruzioni abbia
bisogno di un alternativa!<br/>
<br/>
I pannelli di paglia offrono una soluzione ecologica economica, sana e
assolutamente necessaria per l'industria delle costruzioni. E’ responsabile di
quasi il 40% delle emissioni di CO2 a livello mondiale per la costruzione, il
riscaldamento e il raffreddamento. Questo è davvero uno spreco! Con le
tecnologie odierne e i materiali naturali disponibili, questo spreco può
facilmente essere abbassato a livelli sostenibili!<br/>
<br/>
2. Si prega di donare se si vuole avere un impatto positivo sul benessere delle
persone!<br/>
<br/>
Crediamo che tutti hanno il diritto di vivere in una casa confortevole che è
anche beneficio per il nostro ambiente. Molti pagano prezzi molto elevati per
gli edifici di qualità molto bassa - le case prefabbricate di paglia offrono un
elevato comfort termico in estate e in inverno, senza compromettere il nostro
ambiente.<br/>
<br/>
3. Si prega di donare se si pensa all'indipendenza dei combustibili fossili,  a rendere il mondo un posto più sicuro per vivere!<br/>
<br/>
Paglia, legno e argilla sono abbondanti in tutto il mondo -, applicando questi materiali
in modo efficiente possiamo abbassare la dipendenza dai combustibili fossili e
rendere il mondo un posto più sicuro dove stare.<br/>
<br/>
4. Si prega di donare se volete la paglia nella costruzione ed andare contro corrente!<br/>
<br/>
In Francia appartamenti e scuole sono costruite con  il materiale isolante in paglia. Non c'è da
stupirsi: i pannelli di paglia sono sicuri contro il terremoto, offrono un buon
isolamento e raggiungono la protezione antincendio di 120min quando sono
intonacati con argilla.<br/>
<br/>
5. Si prega di donare se si pensa che gli edifici sicuri non devono essere
fatti solo da cemento!<br/>

Nelle zone terremotate, le case di paglia hanno un vantaggio - la flessibilità
di costruzione. La paglia compressa è portante e flessibile, fornendo sicurezza
eccezionale in zone sismiche.

<p>La tecnologia Ecococon<br/>
<br/>
La nostra tecnologia di produzione attuale richiede un sacco di lavoro manuale.
L'efficienza non è elevata. I 13 collaboratori altamente motivati ​​nella
produzione possono produrre annualmente pannelli per un massimo di 50 case. La
manodopera aumenta il prezzo del pannello e la linea di produzione è per il
momento troppo inefficiente per essere utilizzata in paesi con salari più alti.
Ma se vogliamo risparmiare energia e costruire ecologicamente, una soluzione
deve essere trovata per produrre più case in modo efficiente.<br/>
<br/>
Il concept per la nuova linea di produzione ci consente di produrre pannelli
per 150 case all'anno, con soli 8 persone che lavorano. La linea di produzione
dovrebbe essere abbastanza semplice e, grazie alle macchine certificate, la produzione
potrebbe essere diffusa ad altri paesi. In questo modo il nostro prodotto sano
e benefico potrebbe diffondersi in un posto più vicino a te e contribuire a
creare molte nuove strutture di lavoro in tutto il mondo. Questo aiuterà a
proteggere il nostro ambiente a lungo termine.<br/>
<br/>
Basso consumo di energia durante la produzione e l'uso esclusivo di materiali
rinnovabili è un grande inizio per un prodotto sano ed ecologico, un prodotto
che permette di risparmiare energia e offre comfort per le persone. E,
soprattutto, a causa delle risorse ampiamente disponibili utilizzate nella
produzione, può essere posizionato ovunque.<br/>
<br/>
Ora la produzione è basata in Lituania e questa è l'unica fabbrica,  ma questa situazione sarà modificata con il vostro
aiuto. Le nuove linee di produzione forniranno nuove opportunità sul mercato
del lavoro e sosteranno una rete di piccole imprese che si preoccupano per
l'ambiente.</p>
<p>Storia di case di paglia<br/>
<br/>
Quando le persone sentono parlare di case di paglia, ricordano spesso la fiaba dei
I Tre Porcellini. Nella fiaba il finale non era così felice, ma in realtà le case
di paglia sono edifici forti e caldi. Le persone hanno costruito case di paglia
dal 19 ° secolo. La più antica casa di paglia in Europa è a Montargis in
Francia - costruita nel 1921. Negli Stati Uniti nel Nebraska, l'edificio più
antico di paglia nel mondo ha più di 110 anni.<br/>
<br/>
Le tecniche di costruzione di paglia si sono spostate in avanti e si è
dimostrato che le case di paglia sono molto calde e resistenti al fuoco. Questo
tipo di edifici potrebbe facilmente competere con case di mattoni; una seria
alternativa all’edilizia tradizionale. Anche nelle zone sismiche, le case di
paglia hanno un vantaggio; è emerso che durante i terremoti in Cina e Pakistan le
case di paglia non sono state distrutte a causa della loro flessibilità di
costruzione.

</p>
<p><span><br/>
Pannelli di paglia Ecococon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Il team Ecococon ha creato un metodo unico per la pressatura di paglia in una
cornice per pannelli di altissima qualità. L'inizio non è stato facile, e solo
dopo aver trascorso molti anni con ricerche e sperimentazioni,  è stata sviluppata una tecnologia che ci
permette di produrre pannelli di paglia di alta qualità.<br/>
<br/>
L'obiettivo principale era quello di creare una tecnologia che potrebbe fornire
più case ecocompatibili. I nostri pannelli sono materiali naturali, non
contengono componenti chimici. La paglia è un materiale da costruzione che è
abbondante. Utilizzando materiali rinnovabili nessun danno è fatto per
l'ambiente. Nel 2013, durante la partecipazione al concorso  Cradle to Cradle i pannelli di paglia Ecococon
sono stati indicati tra i  migliori 10
prodotti da costruzione ecologici e innovativi del mondo

Ecococon è un sistema di costruzione modulare, il montaggio è molto veloce e
preciso - si può vedere il processo di costruzione <a href=""http://www.ecococon.lt/english/straw-panels/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.ecococon.lt/english/straw-panels/</span></a></span></p>
<p>Con le particolari e i
disegni forniti, una casa di medie dimensioni può essere costruita in 2-3
giorni utilizzando strumenti molto semplici.<br/>
<br/>
I pannelli sono prodotti con pochissima energia incorporata. Ancora più
importante, le eccellenti caratteristiche di U-valore , trattenere il calore
farà risparmiare energia per il riscaldamento e il raffrescamento per tutta la
durata della costruzione. Contribuiremo a ridurre il riscaldamento globale.<br/>
<br/>
La resistenza termica dei pannelli di paglia sono 0,056 W / mK con un
conseguente valore U di 0,107 W / m2K generale (<span>R = 9.3), compreso un
pannello di fibra di legno 60-
100 millimetri all'esterno.<br/>
<br/>
Il valore di isolamento formidabile del muro può
essere sufficiente per raggiungere
casa passiva standard.
La casa passiva standard non si vuole raggiungere
per il  solo basso consumo energetico, ma aumentare la qualità e la durata della costruzione. Garantisce inoltre un più elevato comfort
abitativo.<br/>
<br/>
I pannelli di paglia vengono prodotti in base ad ogni singola progettazione. L'unicità della
tecnologia è la realizzazione di qualsiasi tipo di casa di design, ogni progetto può essere
costruito con pannelli di paglia.
I pannelli possono essere prodotti
individualmente con la larghezza e l'altezza 40-300cm 40-120cm.
Caricare architravi portanti, piani inclinati e angoli sono possibili
senza il cambiamento del materiale.
Lo spessore di 40 cm è di serie.<br/>
<br/>
I pannelli di paglia permettono alle persone di creare un ambiente
sano ed ecologico nel loro
salotto. Per le pareti interne, utilizzando intonaco di argilla
si crea una piacevole microclima.</span></p>
<p>3 nuovi certificati supplementari nel
2016!<br/>
<br/>
Con il sostegno dei fondi strutturali dell'Unione europea (30 000 €, il 50%
della somma complessiva) ci sarà nel mese di ottobre l’avvio di una procedura
per casa passiva, Cradle to Cradle e certificazione CE. Il processo di
certificazione dovrebbe essere completata nel giugno 2016.<br/>

<p><b>Bouw met stropanelen!</b></p>
<p>Help de revolutie in de bouw! Elke gedoneerde €uro bespaart 2 ton CO2.</p>
<p>Gemiddeld bespaart een huis gebouwd van stropanelen (140m2 wandoppelvlak)
meer dan 10 ton CO2, zelfs als hiervoor 500km transport naar de bouwplaats
wordt meegerekend.. Daarnaast levert datzelfde huis de komende 50 jaar, door
zijn extreem lage energievraag voor verwarming en koeling nog eens een
besparing van 50 ton CO2, zelfs vergeleken met een goed geisoleerd huis.</p>
<p>Ø<span> 
</span>Draag bij omdat je het verlagen van de CO2-uitstoot
belangrijk vindt!</p>
<p><b>Duurzame innovatie in de bouw
is broodnodig. Stropanelenbouw zorgt voor een ommekeer!</b></p>
<p>De bouwgerelateerde industrie is verantwoordelijk voor bijna 40% van de
wereldwijde CO2 emissie. Het gaat dan om gebouwverwarming- en koeling en de
bouwindustrie zelf. </p>
<p>Met de techniek van vandaag en met beschikbare natuurlijke materialen kan
deze verspilling makkelijk gereduceerd worden tot een duurzaam aanvaardbaar
niveau.</p>
<p>Ø<span>

<p><b>Tijd voor verandering!</b></p>
<p>We geloven dat een ieder het recht heeft op een comfortabel onderdak dat
bijdraagt aan het milieu.</p>
<p>Er wordt erg veel geld betaald voor gebouwen met een gebrekkig
kwaliteitsniveau. Stropaneel bouw zorgt voor een natuurlijk binnnenklimaat, met
zeer hoge warmte en koude-isolatie, zonder het klimaat geweld aan te doen bij
de productie.</p>

</div></div>","Everybody wants to live in healthy environment. We have a unique straw building technology. Your donation would help us develop efficient production and revolutionise the building industry. Be a part of this development!Our modular straw panel elements have
been a great success for the last 10 years - they provide an economic, healthy
and badly needed ecological solution for the construction industry. We believe
everybody has a right to live in a comfortable house that is beneficial to our
environment.
To achieve this we need to produce the
straw panels closer to you. But this is only possible if we can engineer
more efficient production machinery! Only by heavily investing into the
development of a new generation of machinery can we increase production
efficiency by a factor of four, and take straw bale construction to the next
level.
Your support will make it possible to
develop highly efficient production machinery for local and regional
production. Your support has the potential to save tons of CO2 and primary
energy, both during construction and use of the building. You will not only be
helping us all, but make the World a better place at the same time.
How much CO2 can I save with my
support?
On average a straw panel house (140m2 wall surface) sequesters more than 10t of
CO2, even after including 500km road transport to the building site. And there
will be savings of approx. 50t of CO2 over the next 50 years by reducing the
energy needed for heating and/or cooling, compared even to a low energy house.
Our annual production of panels for 35
houses saves 350t of CO2 through sequestering, and another 1750t of CO2 during
the next 50 years. But we want our production to do better - with a possible
150 houses a year for each new and efficient production site, we will sequester
1500t of CO2 a year and achieve savings of 7500t of CO2 in the future.
If we had only 10 production sites
running for 10 years, the cumulated sequestered CO2 would amount to staggering
150'000t and the long term CO2 savings to another 750'000t.
What will we use your donations for?We
hope to raise 450’000€ to cover all steps listed below. That means every € you
donate has the potential to save 2t of CO2! 
To
move closer to our overall goal we split the process into few stages:
1. Development of a new,
efficient production line
For this stage we need
just 180’000€. This is our primary objective for this Indiegogo
project.
If we raise more funds, we
will continue with step 2 and 3:
2. Certification of
machinery so it can be sold in other countries
3. Help finance one or
more production lines in other countriesEven if we
achieve less, we will be able to reach these goals, it will just take us a bit
longer. And we strongly believe the World cannot afford to wait!
We
need your help to develop our production technology and start a new production
line. We hope that you like our way of saving energy and creating ways of
saving the environment. Read about the details below and on our website www.ecococon.eu
and we will be happy to answer all your questions.Need any additional reasons why you should donate? Here they are:

1.  Please donate if you think the construction business needs an alternative!
Straw panels provide an economic, healthy and
badly needed ecological solution for the construction industry. It is responsible for nearly 40% of worldwide CO2 emissions
for construction, heating and cooling. This is completely wasteful – with today’s
technologies and available natural materials, this can easily be lowered to
sustainable levels!
2. Please donate if you want to have a positive impact on how people live! 
We believe everybody has a right to live in a
comfortable house that is beneficial to our environment. Many pay very high prices for very
low quality buildings – straw panel houses provide high thermal comfort in
summer and winter, without compromising our environment.
3. 
Please donate if you think independence of fossil fuels make the World a safer place to be!
Straw, wood and clay are abundant all over the World –
by applying these in an efficient way we can lower the dependency from fossil
fuels and make the World a much safer place to be.
4.  Please donate if you want straw bale building to go mainstream!.
In France large 7 story
appartments and schools are built with straw as insulation. No wonder:  Straw panels are earthquake safe,  provide good insulation and achieve 120min
fire protection when plastered with clay.
5. 
Please donate if you think earthquake safe buildings should not only be made from concrete!
In the earthquake zones, straw houses have an
advantage - flexibility of construction. Straw panels can take more
than the calculated loads on the wooden construction. Compressed straw is load
bearing and flexible, providing exceptional security in earthquake zones.
6. 
Please donate if you want to take the passivhaus standard one step further!
The Ecococon wall system is
in the process of acquiring Passivhaus certification. By implementing existing details, architects can
easily achieve Passivehouse Standard with natural materials.
7. 
Please donate if you are a fan of the Cradle to Cradle concept!
Ecococon straw panels were listed as one of the
top 10 most ecological and innovative building products in the world. Ecococon panels were between
the 10 finalists in the Cradle to Cradle Innovation Challenge, clearly
demonstrating the ecological potential of the product. We hope to achieve a
complete Cradle to Cradle certification by next year.
8. 
Please donate if you think cost efficient construction is important!
Ecococon is a modular building system which
assembly is very quick and precise. Building a 400m2 house in
three days? That is what the Swiss did with 318m2 of Ecococon wall panels.
Thanks to our concept, construction is efficient and cost effective –
especially in countries with high labor costs.
9. Please donate if you want a system that provides creative freedom to the architect!
 No limits to the design! Any design can be assembled
using different sized panels, produced on demand. The architect has complete
freedom of design.
10.  Please donate if you are concerned about your health! 
Live in a healthy home! Straw panels with clay plaster let people create a healthy and ecological interior. There is nothing more important than our health. Today
buildings might include more than 50000 substances, many of which have never
been checked for toxicity. 






Estimated
development time
Chosen
flexible funding lets us implement different stages of our technology
development, depending on how much money we can raise:

• 
If with your help we raise 180
000 € - we will be able to create functional prototypes of the new
machines. This will help develop and expand our production technology. 
Planned time: 12 - 16 months after the end of the campaign.
• 
If with your help we raise more - we will
be able to move to the next
stages and reach our overall goal faster.

If less money than hoped is raised, we will still invest all funds
raised into partial machinery development and keep you posted about the
progress we have made. 
Delivery
time of perks: estimated delivery time is up to 3 months after the end of
campaign. The delivery time can vary due to various conditions, but you will be
informed if there will be any changes. We will contact you to clarify all
issues about the delivery.
Upon
successful completion of the campaign, you can follow all updates here and on
our website www.ecococon.eu. 






Ecococon
technology
Our
existing production technology demands a lot of manual work. The efficiency is
not high. The 13 highly motivated employees in production can annually produce
panels for up to 50 houses. Labor increases the price of the panel and the
production line is for the moment too inefficient to be used in countries with
higher wages. But if we want to save energy and build ecologically, a solution
must be found to produce more houses efficiently.
The
concept for the new technology line lets us produce panels for 150 houses per
year with just 8 people working. The production line would be fairly simple and
due to certified machinery, production could be spread to other countries. In
this way our healthy and beneficial product could spread to a place closer to
you and help create many new working facilities all over the world. This will
help to protect our environment in the long term.
The
technology would be fairly simple and would not require large investment. Low
energy consumption during production and the exclusive use of renewable
materials is a great start for a healthy and ecological product - a product
that saves energy and provides comfort to people. And most importantly, due to
widely available resources used in production – it can be
located anywhere. 
Now
production is based in Lithuania and this is the only factory – but
this situation will be changed with your help. The new production lines will
provide new opportunities on the labor market and support a network of small
companies that care about the environment.



History
of straw houses
When people hear about straw houses they often remember the
fairy-tale about The Three Pigs. In the fairy-tale the ending was not so happy,
but in reality straw houses are strong and warm buildings. People have been
building straw houses since the 19th century. The oldest straw house in Europe
is in Montargis in France – built
in 1921. In the USA in Nebraska, the oldest straw building in the world is more
than 110 years old.
Straw building techniques have moved forward and it was proved that
straw houses are very warm and fire resistant. These kind of buildings could
easily compete with bricks houses and log houses and became a serious
alternative in traditional building industry. Even in the earthquake zones,
straw houses have an advantage – practice showed that during the earthquakes
in China and Pakistan straw houses were not destroyed because of the
flexibility of construction.
Ecococon straw panels

The Ecococon team has created a unique method for pressing straw
into a frame to produce straight, high quality panels.  The beginning was not easy at all, and only
after spending many years with research and trials a technology was developed
that lets us produce high quality straw panels. 
The main goal was to create technology which could provide more
environmentally friendly houses. Our panels are from natural materials, no
chemical components are included. Straw is a building material that is
plentiful. By using renewable materials no harm is made to the environment. In
2013, during the participation in Cradle to Cradle competition, Ecococon straw
panels were listed as one of the top 10 most ecological and innovative building
products in the world http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/design_innovation/10-finalists-cradle-cradle-product-innovation-challenge-show-what’s

Ecococon is a modular building system which assembly is very quick
and precise – you can see the building process http://www.ecococon.lt/english/straw-panels/  With the provided numbered parts and
drawings, a middle sized house can be built in 2-3 days using just simple tools.

Panels are produced with very little embodied energy. Even more
important, its excellent U-value and heat retaining characteristics will save
energy for heating and cooling throughout the lifetime of the building. Your
savings will also reduce global warming emissions.
The thermal resistance of the straw panels are 0,056 W/mK with a
resulting overall U-value of 0,107 W/m2K (R=9.3), including the 60-
100mm wood fibre board on the outside. 
The formidable insulation value of the wall can be sufficient to
achieve Passive house standard.The passive house Standard does not only
achieve low energy consumption, but increases the quality and durability of the
building. It ensures also a much higher living comfort.
Straw panels are being produced according to
each project individually. The uniqueness of the technology is the
implementation of any kind of house design, any project can be built with straw
panels. Panels can be individually produced with 40-120cm width and 40-300cm
height. Load bearing lintels, inclined tops and braced corners are also
possible without a change of materials. The thickness of 40cm is standard.  
Straw panels let people create a healthy and
ecological atmosphere in their living area. For inside walls, clay plaster
creates a great microclimate.

Thank you for your contribution!(LT)
Visi
norime gyventi sveikoje aplinkoje. Mes sukūrėme unikalią šiaudų statybos
technologiją. Jūsų parama padės plėtoti gamybą ir sukelti revoliuciją statybos
pramonėje. Būkite šios plėtros dalimi!
Šiaudų skydai per pastaruosius 10 metų labai
išpopuliarėjo – jie įnešė ekonominį, sveiką ir labai reikalingą ekologišką
indėlį statybų pramonėje. Mes tikime, jog kiekvienas turi teisę gyventi
jaukiame name, kuris nesukelia žalos aplinkai.
Jūsų parama suteiks galimybę plėtoti efektyvios
gamybos įrenginius vietinei ir užsienio gamybai. Jūs ne tik padėsite mums,
tačiau ir padarysite pasaulį geresne ir švaresne vieta gyventi.
Kam
bus panaudota jūsų parama?
Mes tikimės surinkti 450’000€ įgyvendinti
žemiau pateiktiems žingsniams. Tai reiškia, kad kiekvienas €, kuriuo jūs
paremiate turi potencialą išsaugoti 2t CO2.
Norėdami priartėti prie pagrindinio tikslo, procesą
suskirstėme etapais:
1.  Naujos efektyvios gamybos linijos plėtojimas
Šiame etape reikalinga suma 180’000€. Tai
yra mūsų pagrindinis tikslas šiame Indiegogo projekte. 
Jei
surinksime daugiau, plėtosime 2 ir 3 etapus:
2.  Įrangos
sertifikavimas, kad galima būtų ją realizuoti kitose šalyse.
3.  Padėti
finansuoti vieną ar kelias gamybos linijas kitose šalyse. 
Jei
mes pasieksime mažiau, galėsime pradėti įgyvendinti savo tikslus, tik tai užims
daugiau laiko. 
Mums reikalinga jūsų pagalba išvystyti gamybos
technologijai ir pradėti naują gamybinę liniją. Skaitykite plačiau žemiau bei
mūsų internetinėje svetainėje www.ecococon.lt kilus klausimams mielai į
juos atsakysime.
Daugiau priežasčių mus paremti:
1. 
Jei manote, kad statybų
sektoriuje reikalinga alternatyva. 
Šiaudų skydai įnešė ekonominį, sveiką ir labai
reikalingą ekologinį indėlį statybų sektoriuje. Žvelgiant pasauliniu
mąstu statybų pramonė yra atsakinga už beveik 40% CO2 išskyrimą pačių statybų
metu bei šildant ir vėdinant pastatus. Su šiuolaikinėmis technologijomis ir prieinamomis
natūraliomis medžiagomis ši tarša gali būti ženkliai sumažinta. 
2.  Jei
norite padaryti teigiamą poveikį žmonių gyvenimo kokybei.
Mes tikime, kad
kiekvienas turi teisę gyventi jaukiame name, kuris neturi neigiamo poveikio
aplinkai.Daugelis
moka didelę kainą už labai žemą pastatų kokybę – šiaudų skydų namai suteikia
aukšto lygio komfortą tiek vasarą, tiek žiemą be žalos aplinkai.
3. 
Jei manote, kad šiaudiniai namai turi plisti.
Prancūzijoje didelis 7 aukštų pastatas bei mokyklos yra statomos
naudojant šiaudus kaip apšiltinamąją medžiagą. Nieko keisto: šiaudų skydai yra
atsparūs žemės drebėjimams, pasižymi gera šilumos izoliacija bei siekia 120
minučių gaisro atsparumą jei yra nutinkuoti molio tinku. 
4.  Jei manote, kad atsparūs žemės drebėjimams
namai turi būti statomi ne tik iš betono.
Zonose, kuriose gausu žemės drebėjimų, šiaudiniai namai turi privalumą –
konstrukcijos lankstumą. Šiaudų skydai atlaiko didesnes apkrovas nei
apskaičiuotos medinių konstrukcijų apkrovos. Suspausti šiaudų skydai yra
laikančioji ir tuo pačiu lanksti konstrukcija, suteikianti išskirtinį saugumą
žemės drebėjimų zonose.
5.  Jei manote, kad pasyvūs namai turi būti iš natūralių
medžiagų.
2016 metais planuojamas Ecococon sienų sistemos sertifikavimas Pasyvaus
namo sertifikatu. Architektai lengvai gali pasiekti pasyvaus namo standartą
naudodami natūralias medžiagas.
6.  Jei manote, kad ekologiškumas svarbu.
Ecococon šiaudų skydai pateko į top 10 ekologiškiausių ir inovatyviausių
produktų visame pasaulyje. Ecococon skydai pateko tarp 10 finalistų Cradle to
Cradle inovacijų konkurse. 2016 metais tikimės pasiekti Cradle to Cradle
sertifikavimą, kas pagrįs produkto ekologiškumą. 
7.  Jei manote, kad ekonomiškai efektyvi statyba
yra svarbi.
Ecococon yra modulinė statybos sistema, kurios surinkimas yra greitas ir
tikslus. Ar įmanoma pastatyti 400 m2 namą per tris dienas? Tai padarė Šveicarai
su 318 m2 Ecococon šiaudų skydų. Konstrukcijos dėka, statybos yra produktyvios
ir ekonomiškai efektyvios – ypač šalyse su brangia darbo jėga. 
8.  Jei manote, kad architektūrinė laisvė
svarbi.
Jokių dizaino apribojimų! Visų tipų dizainai gali būti įgyvendinti
naudojant skirtingo dydžio skydus pagamintus pagal individualų projektą.
Architektai turi visišką laisvę projektavimui. 
9.  Jei jums rūpi jūsų sveikata.
Gyvenkite
sveikuose namuose. Šiaudų skydai su molio tinku leidžia sukurti sveiką ir
ekologišką vidaus dizainą. Nėra nieko svarbiau nei mūsų sveikata. Šiandieninė
statyba gali turėti iki 50000 medžiagų, kurių didžioji dalis net nebuvo tirta
dėl toksinų.

Costruire con pannelli di
paglia!
Ogni euro donato salva 2
tonnellate di CO2. Contribuisci a rivoluzionare l’edilizia!
In media una casa
costruita con pannelli di paglia (circa 140 mq di superficie muro) incamera più
di 10 tonnellate di CO2, anche dopo aver effettuato 500 km di trasporto su
strada verso il cantiere.
Inoltre ci sarà un
risparmio di circa 50 t di CO2 nei prossimi 50 anni, riducendo l’energia
necessaria per il riscaldamento e raffrescamento.
Se vi interessa ridurre le
emissioni di CO2, siete pregati di donare!!
Tutti vogliono vivere in un ambiente sano. Abbiamo una
tecnologia costruttiva unica utillizzando la paglia. La tua donazione aiuterebbe
a sviluppare una produzione efficiente rivoluzionando l'industria edilizia. Fai
parte di questo sviluppo!

I nostri elementi di paglia modulari sono stati un grande successo negli ultimi
10 anni, forniscono una soluzione ecologica economica, sana e assolutamente
necessaria per l'industria delle costruzioni. Crediamo che tutti hanno il
diritto di vivere in una casa confortevole con il beneficio per il nostro
ambiente.

Per raggiungere questo obiettivo abbiamo bisogno di produrre pannelli di paglia
più vicino a noi. Tutto questo è possibile solo se progettiamo macchinari di
produzione più efficienti!
Solo investendo pesantemente nello sviluppo di una nuova
generazione di macchine possiamo aumentare l'efficienza della produzione.
Con il vostro supporto si potranno sviluppare macchine di produzione ad alta
efficienza per la produzione locale e regionale. Un enorme potenziale per
salvare tonnellate di CO2 e di energia primaria, sia in fase di costruzione e
durante l'utilizzo dell'edificio. Non sarà solo per aiutare tutti noi, ma
rendere il mondo un posto migliore.


Quanta CO2 posso risparmiare con il mio supporto?

La produzione annuale di pannelli per 35 case consente di risparmiare 350t di
CO2, e altre  1750t di CO2 nel corso dei
prossimi 50 anni. Ma noi vogliamo fare meglio - con 150 case all'anno per ogni
nuovo ed efficiente sito produttivo, saranno risparmiate 1500t di CO2 all'anno
e otterremmo un risparmio di 7500t di CO2 nel futuro.

Se avessimo solo 10 siti produttivi in ​​esecuzione per 10 anni, la CO2
cumulato sarebbe pari a 150'000t  (sconcertante!)
e il risparmio di CO2 a lungo termine ad altre 750'000t.


Come utilizzeremo le vostre donazioni ?

Speriamo di raccogliere € 450'000  per
coprire tutti i passaggi elencati di seguito. Ciò significa che ogni € donato
ha il potenziale di salvare 2t di CO2!


Per avvicinarsi al nostro obiettivo generale abbiamo diviso il processo in alcune
fasi:

1. Sviluppo di una nuova, efficiente linea di produzione; 
Per questa fase abbiamo bisogno solo € 180'000. Questo è il nostro obiettivo
primario per questo progetto chiamato Indiegogo.

Se riceveremo più fondi, continueremo con la fase 2 e 3:

2. La certificazione delle macchine in modo che possa essere venduto in altri
paesi

3. contribuire a finanziare una o più linee di produzione in altri paesi

Anche se otteniamo meno, saremo in grado di raggiungere questi obiettivi, solo
ci vorrà un po’ più di tempo. E crediamo fortemente che il mondo non può più
permettersi di aspettare!


Abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto per sviluppare la nostra tecnologia di
produzione e iniziare una nuova linea di produzione. Ci auguriamo che ti
soddisfi il nostro pensiero di risparmio energetico e la creazione di modi di
salvare l'ambiente. Leggi i dettagli di seguito e sul nostro sito web
www.ecococon.eu e saremo lieti di rispondere a tutte le vostre domande.
Hai bisogno di eventuali ulteriori motivi  per donare? Eccoli:


1. Si prega di donare se si pensa che il settore delle costruzioni abbia
bisogno di un alternativa!

I pannelli di paglia offrono una soluzione ecologica economica, sana e
assolutamente necessaria per l'industria delle costruzioni. E’ responsabile di
quasi il 40% delle emissioni di CO2 a livello mondiale per la costruzione, il
riscaldamento e il raffreddamento. Questo è davvero uno spreco! Con le
tecnologie odierne e i materiali naturali disponibili, questo spreco può
facilmente essere abbassato a livelli sostenibili!

2. Si prega di donare se si vuole avere un impatto positivo sul benessere delle
persone!

Crediamo che tutti hanno il diritto di vivere in una casa confortevole che è
anche beneficio per il nostro ambiente. Molti pagano prezzi molto elevati per
gli edifici di qualità molto bassa - le case prefabbricate di paglia offrono un
elevato comfort termico in estate e in inverno, senza compromettere il nostro
ambiente.

3. Si prega di donare se si pensa all'indipendenza dei combustibili fossili,  a rendere il mondo un posto più sicuro per vivere!

Paglia, legno e argilla sono abbondanti in tutto il mondo -, applicando questi materiali
in modo efficiente possiamo abbassare la dipendenza dai combustibili fossili e
rendere il mondo un posto più sicuro dove stare.

4. Si prega di donare se volete la paglia nella costruzione ed andare contro corrente!

In Francia appartamenti e scuole sono costruite con  il materiale isolante in paglia. Non c'è da
stupirsi: i pannelli di paglia sono sicuri contro il terremoto, offrono un buon
isolamento e raggiungono la protezione antincendio di 120min quando sono
intonacati con argilla.

5. Si prega di donare se si pensa che gli edifici sicuri non devono essere
fatti solo da cemento!

Nelle zone terremotate, le case di paglia hanno un vantaggio - la flessibilità
di costruzione. La paglia compressa è portante e flessibile, fornendo sicurezza
eccezionale in zone sismiche.



6. Si prega di donare se si vuole fare un passo avanti con lo standard
Passivhaus!

Il sistema a parete Ecococon è in procinto di ottenere la certificazione
Passivhaus. Con l'implementazione di particolari esistenti, gli architetti
possono facilmente raggiungere lo standard passivo utilizzando materiali
naturali.

7. Si prega di donare se sei un fan del Cradle to Cradle concept!

I pannelli di paglia Ecococon sono stati indicati come uno dei top 10 tra la maggior
parte dei prodotti da costruzione ecologici e innovativi al mondo. I pannelli
Ecococon sono tra i 10 finalisti del Cradle to Cradle Innovation Challenge,
dimostrando chiaramente il potenziale ecologico del prodotto. Speriamo di
ottenere la certificazione completa Cradle entro il prossimo anno.


Inizio modulo

8. Si prega di donare se si pensa che i
costi efficienti di costruzione siano importanti!

Ecococon è un sistema di costruzione modulare a montaggio molto veloce e
preciso. Costruire una casa di 400m2 in tre giorni? Questo è ciò che ha fatto
la Svizzera con 318m2 di pannelli Ecococon. Grazie al nostro concetto, la costruzione
è efficiente ed economica - specialmente in paesi con alti costi del lavoro.

9. Si prega di donare se si vuole un sistema che prevede la libertà creativa dell'architetto!

Nessun limite al design! Tutto il disegno può essere assemblato con pannelli di
dimensioni diverse, prodotte su richiesta. L'architetto ha piena libertà di
progettazione.

10. Si prega di donare se siete preoccupati per la vostra salute!

Vivere in una casa sana! I pannelli di paglia con intonaco di argilla
permettono alle persone di creare un interno sano ed ecologico. Non c'è nulla
di più importante della nostra salute. Gi attuali edifici potrebbero includere
più di 50.000 sostanze, molte delle quali non sono mai state controllate per la
tossicità.




I tempi di sviluppo stimato

Attraverso un finanziamento flessibile ci permette di implementare diversi
stadi del nostro sviluppo tecnologico, a seconda di quanto denaro si può ricavare:


• Se con il vostro aiuto raggiungiamo € 180 000 , saremo in grado di creare
prototipi funzionali delle nuove macchine. Ciò contribuirà a sviluppare ed
espandere la nostra tecnologia di produzione.

Tempo previsto: 12 - 16 mesi dopo la fine della campagna.

• Se con il vostro aiuto raggiungiamo una cifra maggiore,  saremo in grado di muoverci per le prossime
tappe e raggiungere il nostro obiettivo generale più velocemente.


Se raccogliamo meno denaro di quanto sperato, investiremo  tutti i fondi raccolti in sviluppo macchinari
parziale e Vi terremo sempre aggiornati sui progressi.

Termine di consegna di vantaggi: tempo stimato di consegna è fino a 3 mesi dopo
la fine della campagna. Il termine di consegna può variare a causa di varie
condizioni, ma sarete informati se ci saranno cambiamenti. Ci metteremo in
contatto per chiarire tutte le questioni circa la consegna.

In caso di superamento della campagna, è possibile seguire tutti gli
aggiornamenti qui,  e sul nostro sito www.ecococon.eu.
La tecnologia Ecococon

La nostra tecnologia di produzione attuale richiede un sacco di lavoro manuale.
L'efficienza non è elevata. I 13 collaboratori altamente motivati ​​nella
produzione possono produrre annualmente pannelli per un massimo di 50 case. La
manodopera aumenta il prezzo del pannello e la linea di produzione è per il
momento troppo inefficiente per essere utilizzata in paesi con salari più alti.
Ma se vogliamo risparmiare energia e costruire ecologicamente, una soluzione
deve essere trovata per produrre più case in modo efficiente.

Il concept per la nuova linea di produzione ci consente di produrre pannelli
per 150 case all'anno, con soli 8 persone che lavorano. La linea di produzione
dovrebbe essere abbastanza semplice e, grazie alle macchine certificate, la produzione
potrebbe essere diffusa ad altri paesi. In questo modo il nostro prodotto sano
e benefico potrebbe diffondersi in un posto più vicino a te e contribuire a
creare molte nuove strutture di lavoro in tutto il mondo. Questo aiuterà a
proteggere il nostro ambiente a lungo termine.

Basso consumo di energia durante la produzione e l'uso esclusivo di materiali
rinnovabili è un grande inizio per un prodotto sano ed ecologico, un prodotto
che permette di risparmiare energia e offre comfort per le persone. E,
soprattutto, a causa delle risorse ampiamente disponibili utilizzate nella
produzione, può essere posizionato ovunque.

Ora la produzione è basata in Lituania e questa è l'unica fabbrica,  ma questa situazione sarà modificata con il vostro
aiuto. Le nuove linee di produzione forniranno nuove opportunità sul mercato
del lavoro e sosteranno una rete di piccole imprese che si preoccupano per
l'ambiente.
Storia di case di paglia

Quando le persone sentono parlare di case di paglia, ricordano spesso la fiaba dei
I Tre Porcellini. Nella fiaba il finale non era così felice, ma in realtà le case
di paglia sono edifici forti e caldi. Le persone hanno costruito case di paglia
dal 19 ° secolo. La più antica casa di paglia in Europa è a Montargis in
Francia - costruita nel 1921. Negli Stati Uniti nel Nebraska, l'edificio più
antico di paglia nel mondo ha più di 110 anni.

Le tecniche di costruzione di paglia si sono spostate in avanti e si è
dimostrato che le case di paglia sono molto calde e resistenti al fuoco. Questo
tipo di edifici potrebbe facilmente competere con case di mattoni; una seria
alternativa all’edilizia tradizionale. Anche nelle zone sismiche, le case di
paglia hanno un vantaggio; è emerso che durante i terremoti in Cina e Pakistan le
case di paglia non sono state distrutte a causa della loro flessibilità di
costruzione.



Pannelli di paglia Ecococon


Il team Ecococon ha creato un metodo unico per la pressatura di paglia in una
cornice per pannelli di altissima qualità. L'inizio non è stato facile, e solo
dopo aver trascorso molti anni con ricerche e sperimentazioni,  è stata sviluppata una tecnologia che ci
permette di produrre pannelli di paglia di alta qualità.

L'obiettivo principale era quello di creare una tecnologia che potrebbe fornire
più case ecocompatibili. I nostri pannelli sono materiali naturali, non
contengono componenti chimici. La paglia è un materiale da costruzione che è
abbondante. Utilizzando materiali rinnovabili nessun danno è fatto per
l'ambiente. Nel 2013, durante la partecipazione al concorso  Cradle to Cradle i pannelli di paglia Ecococon
sono stati indicati tra i  migliori 10
prodotti da costruzione ecologici e innovativi del mondo
http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/design_innovation/10-finalists-cradle-cradle-product-innovation-challenge-show-what’s


Ecococon è un sistema di costruzione modulare, il montaggio è molto veloce e
preciso - si può vedere il processo di costruzione http://www.ecococon.lt/english/straw-panels/
Con le particolari e i
disegni forniti, una casa di medie dimensioni può essere costruita in 2-3
giorni utilizzando strumenti molto semplici.

I pannelli sono prodotti con pochissima energia incorporata. Ancora più
importante, le eccellenti caratteristiche di U-valore , trattenere il calore
farà risparmiare energia per il riscaldamento e il raffrescamento per tutta la
durata della costruzione. Contribuiremo a ridurre il riscaldamento globale.

La resistenza termica dei pannelli di paglia sono 0,056 W / mK con un
conseguente valore U di 0,107 W / m2K generale (R = 9.3), compreso un
pannello di fibra di legno 60-
100 millimetri all'esterno.

Il valore di isolamento formidabile del muro può
essere sufficiente per raggiungere
casa passiva standard.
La casa passiva standard non si vuole raggiungere
per il  solo basso consumo energetico, ma aumentare la qualità e la durata della costruzione. Garantisce inoltre un più elevato comfort
abitativo.

I pannelli di paglia vengono prodotti in base ad ogni singola progettazione. L'unicità della
tecnologia è la realizzazione di qualsiasi tipo di casa di design, ogni progetto può essere
costruito con pannelli di paglia.
I pannelli possono essere prodotti
individualmente con la larghezza e l'altezza 40-300cm 40-120cm.
Caricare architravi portanti, piani inclinati e angoli sono possibili
senza il cambiamento del materiale.
Lo spessore di 40 cm è di serie.

I pannelli di paglia permettono alle persone di creare un ambiente
sano ed ecologico nel loro
salotto. Per le pareti interne, utilizzando intonaco di argilla
si crea una piacevole microclima.
3 nuovi certificati supplementari nel
2016!

Con il sostegno dei fondi strutturali dell'Unione europea (30 000 €, il 50%
della somma complessiva) ci sarà nel mese di ottobre l’avvio di una procedura
per casa passiva, Cradle to Cradle e certificazione CE. Il processo di
certificazione dovrebbe essere completata nel giugno 2016.

Questi certificati forniranno ulteriore fiducia al nostro prodotto, e forniranno
ulteriori attenzioni  per la nostra
ricerca per portare la costruzione ecologica all’estremo.

Bouw met stropanelen!
Help de revolutie in de bouw! Elke gedoneerde €uro bespaart 2 ton CO2.
Gemiddeld bespaart een huis gebouwd van stropanelen (140m2 wandoppelvlak)
meer dan 10 ton CO2, zelfs als hiervoor 500km transport naar de bouwplaats
wordt meegerekend.. Daarnaast levert datzelfde huis de komende 50 jaar, door
zijn extreem lage energievraag voor verwarming en koeling nog eens een
besparing van 50 ton CO2, zelfs vergeleken met een goed geisoleerd huis.
Ø 
Draag bij omdat je het verlagen van de CO2-uitstoot
belangrijk vindt!
Duurzame innovatie in de bouw
is broodnodig. Stropanelenbouw zorgt voor een ommekeer!
De bouwgerelateerde industrie is verantwoordelijk voor bijna 40% van de
wereldwijde CO2 emissie. Het gaat dan om gebouwverwarming- en koeling en de
bouwindustrie zelf. 
Met de techniek van vandaag en met beschikbare natuurlijke materialen kan
deze verspilling makkelijk gereduceerd worden tot een duurzaam aanvaardbaar
niveau.
Ø 
Draag bij als je vindt dat de bouw verduurzaamd moet worden!
Tijd voor verandering!
We geloven dat een ieder het recht heeft op een comfortabel onderdak dat
bijdraagt aan het milieu.
Er wordt erg veel geld betaald voor gebouwen met een gebrekkig
kwaliteitsniveau. Stropaneel bouw zorgt voor een natuurlijk binnnenklimaat, met
zeer hoge warmte en koude-isolatie, zonder het klimaat geweld aan te doen bij
de productie.
Ø 
Draag bij als je ook denkt dat verandering nodig is!
Draag bij aan grootschalige
besparing van fossiele brandstof en CO2-uitstoot.
Stro, hout en leem zijn over de hele wereld
ruim voor handen. Door deze materialen efficiënt in te zetten kunnen we de
afhankelijkheid van fossiele brandstoffen en CO2-uitstoot belangrijk verlagen.
Ø  Draag bij als je ook gelooft dat onafhankelijkheid van fossiele
brandstof voor een betere wereld zorgt !
Revolutie
in de bouw!
Bouwen met stropanelen begint een serieus
alternatief te vormen voor traditioneel bouwen.
In Frankrijk worden al 7-hoge gebouwen en
scholen gebouwd met stro als isolatie. Dat is op zich  niet vreemd: stropanelen-bouw is
aardbeving-proof, zijn 120 minuten brandwerend, geven een optimale isolatie en
een fantastisch binnenklimaat (mits afgewerkt met leem)
Ø  Draag bij als je voorstander bent van een duurzame revolutie in de
bouw.
Bouw
aardbeving-proof !
Stropanelen-bouw is zeer schokbestendig.
Vanwege de opbouw uit houten delen en het feit dat de geperste stro
constructief en toch flexibel is, geeft het een uitstekende
aardbevingsbestendigheid.
Voor de aardgaswinningsgbieden in
Noord-Nederland zou het ideaal zijn als de schade van de aardgasindustrie
herstelt wordt met natuurlijke bouwmaterialen .
Ø  Draag bij als je ook vindt dat je geen beton moet terugbouwen in
aardbevingsregio’s
Makkelijk
een passief-huis bouwen met natuurlijke materialen! 
Het Ecococon wandsysteem is bezig met
Passiefhuis-certificering. Daarmee wordt een passief huis niet alleen duurzaam
in energieverbruik maar ook in bouwmateriaal.
Ø  Draag bij als je vindt dat een passiefhuis van natuurlijke
bouwmaterialen een beter passief huis is!
Het
meest ecologische product in de wereld?
Ecococon 
was met haar stropanelen een van de 10 finalisten in the
Cradle-to-cradle Innovation Challenge. Komend jaar wordt een volledig
Cradle-to-cradle certificaat verwacht.
Ø  Draag bij als je fan bent van het Cradle-to cradle concept.
Bouw
een huis in 1 dag !
Ecococon is een modulair bouwsysteem
waarmee zeer snel en precies gebouwd wordt.
Een huis van 400m2 bouwen in 3 dagen? Dat
deden ze in Zwitserland met 318m2 stropaneel van Ecococon. Met deze bouwmethode
kan efficiënt en kosten-effectief gebouwd worden; zeker in landen met hoge
arbeidskosten.
Ø  Draag bij als je gelooft in snel en effectief bouwen.
Geen
beperking aan het ontwerp !
Het unieke van het bouwsysteem is dat het
geen beperkingen stelt aan het ontwerp. Elk project kan er mee gebouwd worden.
Het wordt samengesteld uit verschillende op aanvraag  geprefabriceerde “bouwstenen“. De architect
heeft volledige ontwerpvrijheid.
Ø  Draag bij als je gelooft in een bouwsysteem dat creatieve vrijheid aan
de architect biedt.
Leef
in een gezond huis !

The situation of water is drastic.  Sao Paulo, Brazil, a district of some 40
million people, is estimated to run out of water this summer.  Every 21 seconds a child dies of a
water-related disease.  200 million hours
are consumed daily by women and children collecting water.  According to Water.org, the current “water crisis is the #1 global
risk based on impact to society (as a measure of devastation).”  
And it’s not just a 3rd-World problem.  Some experts say California will run out of
water within a year.  Do you know how many
rivers in the US are polluted beyond safe use? 
Chances are there are traces of other peoples’ medication in your
drinking water, and that’s with current purification technologies!  Oh- have you heard of frack water?  Have you ever seen it??? 
Hi.  We are Sonic Cavitation (“SonCav”), and we
have the solution to the global water crisis.  Here it is (she's a beauty, isn't she!):


It’s a sound
solution (literally- sound is a major component of the technology), to ALL of
the above.  It is helpful for the
environment, sustainable, and inexpensive. For example, we can treat wastewater to pure H2O for under $1,000 / acre foot, and we can desalinate seawater at just over $1 / kilo-gallon. We ask you
today to be a part of that solution, as we launch our humanitarian division.  YOU can change water in your home,
neighborhood, state, and indeed the world. 
Please help us make the difference. 
The details are below.  Thank you!



Introducing Sonic Cavitation Relief,  the ""green"" sound solution to drought, and so
much more.



Less than 4% of the Earth's water is drinkable.  And about half of that is in polar ice caps.  Water is the key to life.  In so much of the world there is no water.  Severe drought is everywhere.  In so many other parts of the world, where there is water, that water is poisoned by pollution.  Disease festers in the ponds and lakes.  Millions die from lack of water, and millions more from access to dirty water.  
Few know more the effect of the drought in the United States than our civic leaders in California, who represent the millions affected daily by the lack of water.  The Honorable Miguel Pulido has been Mayor of Santa Ana, California, for more than 20 years.  Mayor Pulido is on the SonCav Board of Advisors.  In his own words...""

So 4% of the Earth's water is drinkable.  What if  we could use the other 96% of the world's water?  What if we could clean the polluted water?  
Sure, we have desalination plants, and wastewater treatment facilities.  Chances are that those who are reading this get their water from one of the two.  Do you know how expensive a reverse osmosis desalination plant is?  They're more than a billion dollars, take 10+ years, to build, and are incredibly environmentally unsound.  They require massive energy to operate, and most dump super-high concentrations of salt back into the ocean!  This is a reverse osmosis plant discharge- it's almost entirely salt:


And with respect to municipal wastewater recycling, do you know that chances are high that there are trace elements of other people's medication in your drinking water???



SonCav has a patented and proven technology that will take any liquid feedstock (like seawater, and wastewater), purifying both the liquid and the solids (like salt, sand, etc.) within, yielding pure H2O, and the separated (now clean) solids.  The entire Unit is housed in a standard shipping container, so it is mobile and compact, super “green” (requiring very little energy to operate, and producing a purified “waste”), and super affordable.
The SonCav concept is complete.  The SonCav Unit engineering is complete.  The “proof of concept” is complete.  The SonCav Generator Prototype is finished and tested.  We took 50°F water into the Unit, and at 150 gallons per minute turned it to 278°F steam!  Modern math would say we needed 30,000HP to accomplish this; we did it with a 75HP motor!  And the first full SonCav Field Unit rolled off the assembly line last month!  It’s now in stress testing for 2 months. 


What does this mean?  Desalination anywhere- everywhere- at a fraction of the current costs, responsibly.  Not in 10 years, at a cost of billions, like reverse osmosis plants, but now, within 6 months, and within each town’s, or company’s, budget.  And without the terrible environmental mess that comes with reverse osmosis.  Plus we can equally treat wastewater, and clean polluted lakes and rivers, to 100% pure H2O.
SonCav Relief has a humanitarian mission: to bring relief to the drought here in America, and across the globe.  But we are aware of needing to take baby steps first.  For our business, that means establishing a Demonstration Facility, where all can come to test their water and experience our technology for themselves.  The town to host our Demonstration Facility to showcase this incredible technology will be the first town to benefit from SonCav technology.  With your help, this can be your town.
Jess Rae Booth is CEO of ECO Integrated Technologies Inc., a major investor in Sonic Cavitation LLC, the entity created for master licensing across all industries in the United States.  Here he provides his testimonial on the importance of SonCav technology for humanitarian purposes.

The full cost to establish our Demonstration Facility is $1,000,000.  We are initiating a crowdfunding campaign to raise $300,000, which is the cost for SonCav Relief to acquire our own SonCav Generator for our Demonstration Facility.  The full budget breakdown can be found below.  In addition to numerous individual unique rewards for your help in ending the drought and water-based disease, the town generating the highest dollar value of combined contributions will be our first choice to visit for establishing our Demonstration Facility there.

DETAILED SUMMARY
One of Sonic Cavitation’s founders is this brilliant guy named Victor Glotov (he has a PhD, a few Masters, military accolades to boot, and is an all-around great guy).  Victor invented the first and only way to commercially harness massive energy inherent in a common occurrence called “cavitation”.   
The end result is our ability to take any type of non-potable water (sea water, waste water, produced water, frack water, etc.) into our machine (a “SonCav Generator”), and the yield will be 100% pure H2O and separated (purified) solids.  Each Unit is completely mobile, and can purify 1 million liters (265,000 gallons) of water per day, requiring only 100KW / hour of energy! 
In plain English, the energy costs to run our machine are 7/100ths of a penny per gallon in Houston, or 2/10ths of a penny per gallon in San Francisco (wow- water is a lot more expensive in SF).  Machines are coupled together to meet a particular town’s needs.  This is a lean, mean and green water purification machine.



The Technology
At the base of Dr. Glotov’s patented technology is the use of mechanical ultrasound to create, and control, cavitation.  Googling “cavitation” will explain it as the creation of a tiny air bubble in water, due to drastic instant changes in pressure.  Quickly after the bubble’s creation, the pressure of the surrounding water causes that air bubble to implode upon itself.  That nanosecond of implosion is a very violent reaction, creating incredible energy, including heat scientifically estimated to be around 5,000 Kelvin (on the low end), which translates to just under 10,000° Fahrenheit (roughly the surface temperature of the sun).  An excellent video capturing the power of a cavitating bubble at 27,500 frames per second can be found here (special shout-out to the folks at Smarter Every Day on You Tube; awesome program teaching practical science to every day Joes; please visit them and support their efforts; in this video, Smarter Every Day shot an AK47 rifle in a swimming pool, producing fantastic cavitation- the fireworks start at 4:30 on the video timeline; right-click on the link and select ""Open in New Tab"" so you don't leave us- we like you): http://bit.ly/AK47Pool.   
In layman terms, any matter passing through the SonCav Generator is flash-fried at 5,000 Kelvin, purifying everything.  Because new feedstock liquid is continually running through the machine at a constant controlled speed, the bath temperature of the total liquid is maintained at approximately 275°F, which is still hot, but manageable.  After passing through the SonCav Generator the 275°F liquid enters the Phase Separator, where it changes state from liquid to gas, with all physical impurities (now also decontaminated) falling to the bottom, and the once-liquid rising to the top as steam.  The steam then passes to a Condenser, where it is brought back to water- clean, 100% pure, H2O.  Notice I mentioned “any liquid”: this same technology can treat municipal wastewater, water contaminated in multiple industries’ production (think Coke, Levis, HP, etc.), and hydro fracturing flowback (frack water), to 100% pure, H2O. 
Justin McKie is a senior engineer with Xylem Water Solutions, the manufacturer of one of our Units' many components.  Here he speaks to us about his thoughts on our ""game-changing"" technology:


Some History
Dr. Glotov’s machine had been in use for years in Lipetsk, Russia.  Dr. Glotov was a colonel general in the Russian army, and served as one of the directors of the technology division of their version of NASA.  He holds multiple advanced degrees, including a doctorate in Biology, and Masters’ Degrees in Biochemistry, Bioengineering, and Management.  There he used the technology to treat, or rather refine, Western Siberian Heavy Crude into diesel and jet fuel.  You may know that oil refining is little more than heating the crude oil to various degrees of high temperatures, yielding your desired output (gasoline, diesel, benzene, etc.).  This technology is exactly that: harnessing the heat energy of cavitation to yield a desired output.  Thus the SonCav Unit was originally used as a mini mobile oil refinery, fueling a large chemical plant, and Russian military aircraft, in Lipetsk.  Southwest Research Institute (www.SouthWestResearch.com), a well-respected oil & gas industry independent tester, visited the Unit in Lipetsk, saw it working, and confirmed samples of feedstock and yield to be as indicated.
Earlier this year SonCav proved the technology here in the United States, at our base facilities in Houston, Texas.  A brief video of the testing can be seen here:  
The Demonstration Unit is a remarkably simple machine, consisting of the SonCav Generator (a tailor-modified multi-stage pump), a feed pump, the motors and variable frequency drives to run both, an evaporator, and the piping to connect it all. 
With the concept proven via our spectacular prototype, we moved to assembly of the first full Field Unit.  That Unit rolled off our assembly line last month.  We quickly re-proved the technology with our full Field Unit, and a few weeks ago it entered into stress testing.  It will be ready for our use in 3 months. Here is a video taken back in April of a tour of the Field Unit being assembled:


Why Crowdfunding?
For SonCav Relief, there is not a moment to lose.  We have the opportunity to bring this technology to solve droughts in California, in Brazil, in the most arid villages in Africa.  We can provide clean water after hurricanes, earthquakes, and nuclear disasters.  We can clean oil spills and other human disasters affecting our planet’s water.  We can save lives in Central America and prevent water related rapes & suicides in India (yup- a real tragedy).  And we can do it at a fraction of current related technology costs, and an even smaller fraction of current technology energy use.  We are lean, mean, and green.



But we must start with a Demonstration Facility.  A location where prospective customers- municipal water districts, towns cities and states, Rotary clubs, UN projects, NGOs- can see a Unit operating for themselves, test their own water, and see first-hand how a SonCav Unit can accomplish their goals.  This testing will lead directly to disaster relief -ready Packages for deployment in earthquake, nuclear contamination, drought, hurricane, oil spill, and war zones.  Where clean water is needed, SonCav Units can provide.  Our cost to establish a Demonstration Facility, including having our own SonCav Unit on-hand for demonstration and by-invitation testing, is $1,000,000.  This will lead to our first revenue, which in turn will allow us to have the Demonstration Facility become self-sustaining.
We decided to go the crowdfunding campaign route because of speed to emergency / disaster relief deployment.  Certainly organizations such as Rotary, the U.N., Red Cross, etc., have special programs to help fund these efforts, and frankly it is they who will be obtaining the SonCav Units for use in their relief efforts, but it can take a year or longer to go through their grant / funding processes.  During just the time we were preparing this campaign, there was a major earthquake in Nepal and an oil spill in California; we want to help now.  Not next year.  Your contribution today can have us with deployed SonCav Field Units in December.

There will be considerable economic benefit to the town where we establish the Demo Facility.  Consider that we expect to run 3 demonstrations per day, on a 6 day schedule.  NGOs, towns, cities, states, foreign governments, private companies with water issues- many will want to come and test their water in our Demo Facility.  So there will be a considerable amount of pure water produced- about 265,000 gallons per day- that will be given to the town.  But with an expected 3 persons visiting the town for each demonstration, there will be considerable economic benefits to our Demo Facility town also: almost 5,000 hotel room nights, and an estimated $350,000 in local expenditures.  Plus, we will charge a nominal fee for each demonstration, providing revenue so the Demo Facility is self-sustaining, and with revenue comes a tax responsibility owed to the host town, benefiting local residents and businesses.
As noted above, the crowdfunding campaign is to raise the funds for the SonCav Unit.  The remainder of funds necessary for the Demo Facility, and any shortfall if we do not reach our crowdfunding goal, will be raised through concessions with the town we select for establishing our Demo Facility, and local businesses that will directly benefit from having our Demo Facility there.  Of course if we exceed our goal, the additional funds mean we can set-up faster, or even consider having multiple Demo Facilities in different towns.

Please Help!  There are many ways you can....
SonCav seeks help in bringing this green technology to humanitarian relief.  Please consider being a part of solving the drought, bettering peoples’ lives, and helping our environment, locally and globally.  And it can start in your hometown: we will seek to establish our Demonstration Facility in the town from which the highest cumulative funding comes. 
There are many ways in which you can help our efforts become reality, and in the process, be the solution to water, starting with making a pledge to our campaign (just select a level from the above-right).  Of course we have several unique perks that are really exciting, from receiving bottled water that was purified in a SonCav Unit, to personally meeting our genius inventor Victor, to even having you be able to adopt or name a SonCav Unit!  (Take a peek to the above-right to see them all.)  
Here's a listing of several additional ways where your assistance would be greatly appreciated!  
· 
Forward an e-mail to 10 of your friends, asking
them to help us solve the drought and other water related tragedies.  We're happy to provide suggested text to copy & paste into your e-mail- just ask us (GKalinosky@SonCav.com)!
· 
Write a letter to your mayor or town council to
encourage them to support SonCav efforts in an effort to attract the
Demonstration Facility to your community.  Again, for suggested text to copy & paste into your
letter, e-mail us and we'll e-mail you right back!  (GKalinosky@SonCav.com);
· 
Tweet an announcement of your support for
efforts to solve water.  Here is a suggested tweet which you can edit at will
and then copy & paste to your Twitterverse: ""FINALLY a #green sound solution 2 the #drought and other global #water woes! Pls help their crowdfunding campaign at http://igg.me/at/LeanGreenDroughtSolutionMachine."" 
· 
Post to your Facebook page an announcement of
your support for efforts to solve water.  Here is a suggested post which you can edit at will
and then copy and paste to your Facebook page; ""Hi everyone-  We may FINALLY have a #green sound solution to the #drought and other global #water woes! Pls take a look at this crowdfunding campaign: http://igg.me/at/LeanGreenDroughtSolutionMachine.  Let's help them get launched.""
· 
Text 5 of your friends to check out our
crowdfunding campaign.  Here is some suggested wording for such a text; ""Let's help this new crowdfunding campaign- http://igg.me/at/LeanGreenDroughtSolutionMachine; a solution to local and global water woes.""

<p>THE STORY          
  </p>
<p>L’idée de la création de la Green Countries est
venue tout d'abord du manque de structure de communication et d'information en
côte d'ivoire et dans la sous-région ouest africaine sur les aspects relatifs
au développement durable. Le manque de comportements citoyens et les
gaspillages constatés dans la société ont aussi été les causes de la création
de cette startup. Le constat aussi a été de voir de nombreux enfants et de
familles dépourvu de nourriture pendant qu’une grande quantité de réserves
alimentaires sont jetés à la poubelle. Le souci de la création de la Green
Countries était donc d'informer de sensibiliser les populations sur les
comportements responsables en société mais aussi de lutter contre le gaspillage
à travers un vaste réseau de distribution des invendus</p><br/>
<p>OBJECTIF    </p>
<p>La Green Countries est né le 1<sup>er</sup> décembre
2014, ses objectifs sont en premier, d’être une plateforme éducative et de
sensibilisation pour les bonnes pratiques en société. En deuxième, de favoriser
la revalorisation des produits alimentaires et non-alimentaires à destination
des acteurs associatifs.</p>
<p>EVOLUTION    </p>
<p>Depuis sa création, la Green Countries à travers les
partenariats qu’elle s’est noué à contribuer à la promotion d’actions
nationales et sous régionales sur le développement durable. Elle a lancé
certains de ses services dont la Green Company qui consiste à faire la
communication digitale sur les pratiques responsables des entreprises, elle a
développé une approche avec les écoles à travers son projet Green School pour
la mise en œuvre d’une démarche durable au sein des établissements basés sur
l’agenda 21 scolaire. De même à travers la Green Window qui est un service
proposé aux hôtels, restaurants et sites touristiques, elle propose une
stratégie de lutte contre le gaspillage. La Green Countries a initié la Green
Market, une bourse virtuelle pour faire la promotion des invendus par un réseau
d’émetteurs et de récepteurs à travers une application et des messages
téléphoniques.</p>
<p>STATE PLACES  AND  WHY WE NEED MONEY?
             </p>
<p>La Green countries contient en son
sein une équipe jeune et dynamique  dont
5 agents permanents  et 2 membres non
permanents. Ses agents se déplacent sur fonds propres et disposent de peu de
moyens techniques  pour travailler.
Malgré cela, la Green Countries a pu nouer 17 partenariats nationaux et
internationaux et participer à des événements majeurs en Côte d’Ivoire tel que
le Salon Africain des Ressources Animales (SARA 2015). La Green Countries
est  associé au patronat Ivoirien dans
toutes les activités relatives au développement durable. Elle a même été
associée au forum RSE TOGO (Responsabilité Sociétale des Entreprises) qui se
tiendra dans le mois de septembre. La green Countries dispose d’un site web
dont la visibilité est supérieur à 8000 vue par mois d’une page Facebook
principale  de plus de 2000 like  et de trois pages Facebook projets. Nous
avons en plus des services du site Web, 4 autres services dont le plus
dynamique est celui qui consiste en la lutte contre le gaspillage. En plus des
difficultés techniques et financières que rencontre la Green Countries la
compréhension du développement durable en Afrique et plus particulièrement en
Côte d’Ivoire est encore faible. Il faut beaucoup plus de communication à la
Green Countries pour faire passer son message. Pour toutes ses raisons techniques
financières et dans un souci d’impact plus perceptible, nous vous demandons de
soutenir la startup Green  Countries dans
sa levée de fonds .Cette levée de fonds qui favorisera le développement de ses
activités dont la conséquence est la construction d’une société durable.</p>

2014, ses objectifs sont en premier, d’être une plateforme éducative et de
sensibilisation pour les bonnes pratiques en société. En deuxième, de favoriser
la revalorisation des produits alimentaires et non-alimentaires à destination
des acteurs associatifs.
EVOLUTION    
Depuis sa création, la Green Countries à travers les
partenariats qu’elle s’est noué à contribuer à la promotion d’actions
nationales et sous régionales sur le développement durable. Elle a lancé
certains de ses services dont la Green Company qui consiste à faire la
communication digitale sur les pratiques responsables des entreprises, elle a
développé une approche avec les écoles à travers son projet Green School pour
la mise en œuvre d’une démarche durable au sein des établissements basés sur
l’agenda 21 scolaire. De même à travers la Green Window qui est un service
proposé aux hôtels, restaurants et sites touristiques, elle propose une
stratégie de lutte contre le gaspillage. La Green Countries a initié la Green
Market, une bourse virtuelle pour faire la promotion des invendus par un réseau
d’émetteurs et de récepteurs à travers une application et des messages
téléphoniques.
STATE PLACES  AND  WHY WE NEED MONEY?
             
La Green countries contient en son
sein une équipe jeune et dynamique  dont
5 agents permanents  et 2 membres non
permanents. Ses agents se déplacent sur fonds propres et disposent de peu de
moyens techniques  pour travailler.
Malgré cela, la Green Countries a pu nouer 17 partenariats nationaux et
internationaux et participer à des événements majeurs en Côte d’Ivoire tel que
le Salon Africain des Ressources Animales (SARA 2015). La Green Countries
est  associé au patronat Ivoirien dans
toutes les activités relatives au développement durable. Elle a même été
associée au forum RSE TOGO (Responsabilité Sociétale des Entreprises) qui se
tiendra dans le mois de septembre. La green Countries dispose d’un site web
dont la visibilité est supérieur à 8000 vue par mois d’une page Facebook
principale  de plus de 2000 like  et de trois pages Facebook projets. Nous
avons en plus des services du site Web, 4 autres services dont le plus
dynamique est celui qui consiste en la lutte contre le gaspillage. En plus des
difficultés techniques et financières que rencontre la Green Countries la
compréhension du développement durable en Afrique et plus particulièrement en
Côte d’Ivoire est encore faible. Il faut beaucoup plus de communication à la
Green Countries pour faire passer son message. Pour toutes ses raisons techniques
financières et dans un souci d’impact plus perceptible, nous vous demandons de
soutenir la startup Green  Countries dans
sa levée de fonds .Cette levée de fonds qui favorisera le développement de ses
activités dont la conséquence est la construction d’une société durable.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>What would you do if every year, ten
thousand people showed up in your backyard, had a huge party, and then forgot
to clean up after they left?</p>
<p>That's what happens every Fourth of
July on Anna Maria Island.  While many visitors do take their trash with
them, sadly, there is still a lot of plastic, glass and aluminum that gets
forgotten.</p>
<p>Not only is all this trash a blight
on the shoreline landscape, it presents a real danger to the locals.  And
by “locals” here, I mean the gulls and gopher tortoises, the manatees and rays,
and the loggerheads and dolphins, the pompano, and snook, the tarpon and the
pelicans.  I mean the real locals, the ones who deserve our respect and
need our help more than ever.</p>
<p>Our plan is simple: we want to rally
just 100 volunteers to show up at 7AM on the morning of July Fifth, and clean
Holmes Beach.  That’s it.</p>
<p>If we can get a hundred volunteers,
we believe we can clean the entire shoreline of Holmes Beach, and leave it, and
the gulf, a cleaner, safer home for the locals, and for all us guests, as well.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>We need posters to get the word out
locally.</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>We need water and trash bags for our
volunteers who come out to clean up on the Fifth of July.</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>We need to thank our volunteers with a
t-shirt that will remind them of the great time they had cleaning up Holmes
Beach (because it will be fun!).</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>We need $3000.00.  That's 100
supporters giving $30 each.</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>For a $30 contribution, you'll
receive a ""Respect the Locals"" Sponsor t-shirt and a “Respect The
Locals” sticker, and also provide a ""Respect The Locals"" t-shirt for
one of our volunteers, along with water and trash bags.  And you’ll help us offset the cost of
promotional posters.</p><p>•<span> 
</span>If we don’t reach our goal, we will
still honor our perks, and we will get as many volunteer t-shirts as possible,
and give them out to volunteers on a first-come basis.</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>If we exceed our goal, we will still
only buy enough t-shirts for 100 volunteers. 
Anything left over will go to Anna Maria Island Turtle Watch.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Are we going to change the
world?  Probably not in one day.  But we are going to clean our little corner
of it.  </p>
<p>And with that small action, with our
tiny campaign, people will begin taking notice.  Our volunteers will take a measure of pride in
having been a part of taking care of something as precious as our
shoreline.  Our donors will feel good
about having contributed to something so worthy.  Others will see this example and start
thinking about taking a trash bag with them when they visit Anna Maria Island.  Or maybe they will think about a local
campaign they can start.</p>
<p>When my kids were little, they had to
gather at least two pieces of trash whenever we packed up after a day at the
beach.  After a while it became a game:
each kid trying to outdo the other by finding more than just two pieces of
trash.  It was fun and it taught them to
leave the world better then how they found it.</p>
<p>That’s the real impact of our little
campaign: showing people that they can make a difference.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The biggest risk this campaign faces
is that we don’t receive any sponsors from IndieGoGo, and don’t have swag to
hand out to our volunteers.  I believe
people will come anyway, because I believe people will rally around a noble
cause.</p>
<p>Either way, we are promoting the
campaign with posters at local businesses, through Facebook and Twitter.  We feel confident we can get the volunteers;
they may just have to go without t-shirts.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Seriously, some folks cannot afford
$30.  We get that.  No worries:</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>If you’re local to the Bradenton
area, just show up at the Public Beach at the end of Manatee Avenue at 7AM on Sunday, July 5<sup>th</sup>!  Hopefully, we will have a t-shirt in your
size.  Our trash bags are one size fits
all!  ;)</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>If you’re not in the Bradenton area,
but you love beaches and turtles and hate trash, give us a shout on social
media!</p>

<p><b>What are the goals of this project?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The project is a pilot to create an ecologically sound, sustainable business model. In summary, consider how our forests are being destroyed and farming is being infused with harmful chemicals. This project is raising money to buy 90 hectares of land as a pilot project in Benin, West Africa. This land will be used to grow and harvest EPO (Ecological Palm Oil) to create jobs to make soap and oils for exporting around the world. The business processing activities will start in Africa where many graduate people are jobless, and thus contribute not only to the creation of a healthy environment, but a healthy local economy. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why the choice of “Ecological Palm Oil (EPO) tree best to assist in the rescue of the environment and produce safe, quality products?</b><br/></p>
<p>The EPO tree is different from hybrid varieties in that it doesn’t require the use of chemicals that could have a negative impact on environment. Its kernel shell is to be used as charcoal. No forest destruction and 30% of our investment in trees plantations. And more, wastes processing for sanitation and to feed ecollogically EPO's seedlings. Wildlife is safe.</p>
<p>Its empty bunch is used to make 100% natural soap and its mesocarp oil so fluider.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How will your raised funds be used?</b></p>
<p>Funds will be used to buy 90 Hectares of land in Benin republic in Zou, Africa as the basis for a pilot program to grow, harvest and manufacture Ecological Palm Oil (EPO). We will buy 13,500 seedlings, 13,500 protective wires for seedlings, hire 4 agronomists, 1 accountant, purchase transportation, fund composting and pay our workforce. (See details in the tables and graphs below). </p>
<p>20% of funds will be saved for processing activities and trade in  Bank account. The dividends associated with 20% of funds in Bank account will be used for contingency expenses and casual labor related to processing activities. If this projection isn’t sufficient (Market’s fluctuation), another campaign could be launched to raise additional money or consider a bank loan.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What will be done if the needed funding isn’t raised or exceeds?</b></p>
<p>The number of hectares of land will be reviewed in down or high .</p>
<p><b>What about</b> <b>ecology and environment protection?</b></p>
<p>Our forests are being destroyed and our farming land is more and more infected with use of some harmful chemicals. This impedes the development of organic agriculture our future generations! EPO doesn't need any use of chemicals.</p>

<p>PHE est le type de palmier naturel en constante diminution. Il est respectueux de l’environnement. Cet arbre ne demande pas l’usage de l’engrais
chimique qui pourrait impacter négativement l’environnement. Nous pensons que le Monde est confronté à beaucoup de défis. L’un des
gros défis est l’évitement de certains engrais chimiques souvent utilisés qui
détruisent l’environnement. Par exemple, on peut citer l’usage de certains engrais chimiques très décrié dans certains pays du monde dont l'Indonésie, la Malaysie, le Libéria, le Cameroun, l'Ouganda car nocif à l’environnement. Dans les deux
grands pays producteurs mondiaux de palmiers à huile de variété sélectionnée
que sont l’Indonésie et la Malaisie comme dans certains pays africains, la préoccupation d'alerte court les rues. Il faut aussi en remplaçant les terres par les palmiers à huile, compenser. Donc, 30% de notre investissement, chaque année, sera dans les plantations d'arbres.  </p>

</div></div>","This pilot Ecological business is supported by international network of palm oil players for sustainable palm oil www.rspo.org. Our pilot program is aware of and responsive to climate and deforestation issues. 
What does Ecological Palm Oil EPO mean?                                                                    
It is an endangered natural and environmental  species of tree that produces fruits that can be processed to get fluider oils and 100% natural Soap with 0% of chemicals use. It is so sustainable and environmental as it doesn't use any chemicals but compost. Its kernel shell (Picture Below) is so resistant and inflammable to replace wood charcoal so that we limit deforestation in Africa and world... 
Sustainable palm oil is imperative to rescue environment in disasters and EPO can do!

So many other benefits of EPO are given below!


                          A seedling of Ecological Palm Oil




                    Some seedlings of Ecological Palm Oil

Here are some trees (Despite its enormous environment and health benefits, Ecological Palm Oil is threatened by extinction over the coming years).



Here is a tree with some bunches.

Some EPO's bunches of ripe nuts.

To support this environment and health project,click on words""Back it"" in red above Perks on your right.


What are the goals of this project?



The project is a pilot to create an ecologically sound, sustainable business model. In summary, consider how our forests are being destroyed and farming is being infused with harmful chemicals. This project is raising money to buy 90 hectares of land as a pilot project in Benin, West Africa. This land will be used to grow and harvest EPO (Ecological Palm Oil) to create jobs to make soap and oils for exporting around the world. The business processing activities will start in Africa where many graduate people are jobless, and thus contribute not only to the creation of a healthy environment, but a healthy local economy. 

Why the choice of “Ecological Palm Oil (EPO) tree best to assist in the rescue of the environment and produce safe, quality products?
The EPO tree is different from hybrid varieties in that it doesn’t require the use of chemicals that could have a negative impact on environment. Its kernel shell is to be used as charcoal. No forest destruction and 30% of our investment in trees plantations. And more, wastes processing for sanitation and to feed ecollogically EPO's seedlings. Wildlife is safe.
Its empty bunch is used to make 100% natural soap and its mesocarp oil so fluider.



How will your raised funds be used?
Funds will be used to buy 90 Hectares of land in Benin republic in Zou, Africa as the basis for a pilot program to grow, harvest and manufacture Ecological Palm Oil (EPO). We will buy 13,500 seedlings, 13,500 protective wires for seedlings, hire 4 agronomists, 1 accountant, purchase transportation, fund composting and pay our workforce. (See details in the tables and graphs below). 
20% of funds will be saved for processing activities and trade in  Bank account. The dividends associated with 20% of funds in Bank account will be used for contingency expenses and casual labor related to processing activities. If this projection isn’t sufficient (Market’s fluctuation), another campaign could be launched to raise additional money or consider a bank loan.
What will be done if the needed funding isn’t raised or exceeds?
The number of hectares of land will be reviewed in down or high .
What about ecology and environment protection?
Our forests are being destroyed and our farming land is more and more infected with use of some harmful chemicals. This impedes the development of organic agriculture our future generations! EPO doesn't need any use of chemicals.

For sustainable development and ecological balance, 30% of our profits each year will be reinvested into plantations.


EPO trees won't take chemical fertilizer but Compost to thrive well. It will help more for environment sanitation. Wildlife isn't affected.

Our pilot program has a built-in infrastructure to invest in replacing forests as part of the manufacturing process. 
ADVANTAGES OF NATURAL SOAP
It doesn’t involve use of any chemicals or manufactured products that could affect skin, protects against undesirable effects and is for skin's smoothing. It is a 100% natural soap. The processing activities consist of burning bunches of palm oil after removing nuts. The ash (raw material) is cooked for soap liquid extraction that is mixed to mesocarp oil. This cooking removes all residue and dirtiness water that are the remaining liquid when soap liquid extraction is over.

The palm oil created through this project will be 100% natural soap with no chemicals, and is much safer for your skin.  
    



Oil after specific treatments full of natural compounds for food, vitamins A; D; E ; anti-cancer properties, skin protection agents.




Economy
We plan to share with the
World, quality products by making “Natural soap” and manufacturing ""fluider oils"" with strict respect of environment for sustainable development by avoiding disasters on natural ressources.
What about ecology and environment protection?

Our forests are
being destroyed and our farming land is more and more infected with use of some
harmful chemicals. What impedes any organic agriculture and future generations
life!
 EPO doesn't need any use of chemicals.
The shell
of its kernel will replace Wood charcoal for cooking. So deforestation will be
limited.

Practice of composting to feed EPO's seedlings or trees in compost, will contribute to environmental sanitation.
30% of our investment will be,each year, into forests (emphasis on endangered species). 

And
employment?


This project will contribute
to hire lots of people for plantation job, and especially when the processing
activities will start in Africa where many graduate people are jobless.
In Western countries..., trading activities of soap and
oils will be opportunity to hire workers.
Where
will the project be implemented?
This project will
be on 90 Hectares of land as a trial and will be implemented in Benin (West Africa).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Can you believe that people living on a gigantic island have lost almost all access to water? Why should we step up and take matters into our own hands? In the past 10 years the Urban Growth Boundary of Charleston City has caused our population to grow tremendously and Johns Island has taken on 81% of the city's new growth.  But so far neither County or City municipalities or park systems have provided public access to water, except for under the Limehouse Bridge. Rampant developer interests have won out here between developing Charleston, SC and Kiawah Island, but we are working with everyone we can to bring water back to the people of Johns Island. As people who live here, we know how important this precious resource is to our community. We are stepping up to secure it for our whole community, before it is all gone. </p>
<p>One centralized property can provide so many solutions to our area, and that's exactly what we intend to do.</p>
<ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have spent 10 years listening to the multi-cultural needs of our community as it is being rapidly developed, and 14 months in due diligence and business planning for this unique water access property. Local Pulse LLC was formed in response to research and meetings on both non and for profit avenues of business and how to best meet the needs of the community while also acting quickly to secure land in a competitive market. What we need now is grassroots support for a down payment to secure the property while we continue our other funding efforts. We are actively working within almost every avenue of fund seeking possible, including applications to correctly suited grants, co-hosting events that aid society and grassroots entrepreneurs, seeking investors and sponsors, land preservation avenues, and so on. The seller is willing to work with us, as we have a legally binding contract that states 2 important things: 1) He will not be gentrified, he may stay and live out his days in the home he built until his death. 2) The property will be used to provide Public Access to Water and a Multi-Cultural Community &amp; Event Center.</p>

<li>What We Need = Fund drive goal here is $111,000 which would allow the down payment + taxes &amp; closing costs for the property</li>
<li>What You Will Get = 1) The satisfaction of looking back on your life and knowing you made a huge and tangible impact for WATER and PEOPLE and CULTURE and SOCIETY and NATURE and SOLUTIONS.... 2) We have some awesome POND PARTIES &amp; CONCERT PERKS that are sure to bring a huge smile to your face and help you meet some new friends. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Place Based Impact is extremely important in a rapidly growing community that is being further isolated and loosing it's resources.  We live in a country where separation and bias are the norm. We are taught to isolate ourselves, and put in boxes and categories that do not create the true joy connection and strength through our differences.  Even though, on most accounts, we are very much the same. We are a country that greatly needs to heal from past atrocities and have space that is steeped in multi-cultural togetherness and opportunity for growth.  A country so consumed by consumerism that our children are literally missing out on much of what we hold dear.

<li>Nature Programming is so simple and powerful. Having spent the past 15 years providing for kids to play in the woods, we are thrilled to bring this to the larger community.

Can you believe that people living on a gigantic island have lost almost all access to water? Why should we step up and take matters into our own hands? In the past 10 years the Urban Growth Boundary of Charleston City has caused our population to grow tremendously and Johns Island has taken on 81% of the city's new growth.  But so far neither County or City municipalities or park systems have provided public access to water, except for under the Limehouse Bridge. Rampant developer interests have won out here between developing Charleston, SC and Kiawah Island, but we are working with everyone we can to bring water back to the people of Johns Island. As people who live here, we know how important this precious resource is to our community. We are stepping up to secure it for our whole community, before it is all gone. 
One centralized property can provide so many solutions to our area, and that's exactly what we intend to do.

Restore access to water for the people of Johns Island and surrounding areas == 14 acres of fresh spring fed ponds to bring the family and meet your neighbors. 
Provide common ground through common interest and meeting community needs == A community is stronger, happier, less wasteful, and more united when everyone feels welcome and knows they have a real community space to interact through common interest.
Nature programming for children both young and old == We all need less time looking at squares and living in squares, and more time in organic open space with movement that is not an hour or so away. 
Multi-Cultural Community Center and circular economy commerce space == True solutions are holistic, include meeting several needs at once, and grassroots means supporting the local economy and sharing resources. That's what we're all about.

It takes a village to be a village. Outreach to meet whole community needs is paramount as we preserve land and culture, diversify land and culture and sustain land and culture.

</div></div>","BULK App : a useful tool for the Zero Waste community around the world
Tired of
fiddling with packaging? Want to help the environment? Shopping the
package-free aisles can also save you time and money, but only if you know
where to find them!  
Hi my name is
Bea Johnson. I am the author of the book and the blog Zero Waste Home.
My family has adopted a Zero Waste lifestyle since 2008 -the trash we generate
each year fits in a jar.

I speak about my lifestyle all over the world, and people’s first reaction is: ""Oh I can’t do that, I don’t have bulk near me"". But had I heard about a zero waste family 9 years ago, I would have said the same thing. Yet, I found that package-free goods are everywhere, you just need to know where to find them!That's why I created a free app, Bulk: It points to bulk food bins and liquid refills worldwide and lets you share the locations that you find with the zero waste community. But now, we need your help to save it!How does it works ?The app is available in the iTunes App Store and Android Market and its features include:• Search, add and rate bulk locations worldwide, identifying the selection available and whether or not reusable containers are permitted• Locate the bulk businesses closest to you or near a specific address• Narrow your search by bulk type (are you looking to refill on body care, dog food, wine?) Today, more than 10,000 users have entered over 3000 locations, in more than 30 countries. Thanks to those who've shared and rated locations, BULK has globally become the zero waste community's most useful tool, making package free locations easy to find and waste free living possible even when we travel. But now the app's life is in peril and it needs your help!What we need nowI created the app using the US$ 25.000 grant that I received from winning the Green Awards in 2011. What I did not foresee by launching it, is that we would have to keep up with the constant changes to Google and Apple's operating systems, and keep funding costly updates.My family has invested an additional amount of $5000 out of pocket on the app to make it international (the first release was targeted at just the US & Canada), cover the various annual hosting & licensing fees, and save the Apple version, before technology advancement make it completely unusable.Although we want to keep the app going, my hubby has reached a point where our family can no longer absorb the costs related to running it. So time has come for the community to save its app!With the money raised, we’ll be able to save the Android app, but also improve the international mapping system, and add features such as comments and pictures, and even make a website so that if you’re planning a trip, you can prepare an itinerary based on bulk locations.Staying true to the spirit of the zero waste lifestyle is important to us, which is why:• We'd like to keep the App free AND add-free as long as we can.• We're not offering the usual unnecessary material perks (stickers, T-shirts, mugs, etc…) for this crowdfunding campaign. How you can helpIf BULK lives, thousands more will be able to eliminate packaging from their daily lives!But your contribution would mean even more, because buying is voting. Every penny that we as consumers spend has the power to support a practice that is sustainable or one that is destructive. When we buy packaging, it’s a way for us to say that we love packaging and dream of a world filled with packaging for the future. But when we’re able to buy in bulk, our money is directly invested in a sustainable waste-free future (the more we buy in bulk, the more bulk will be available). Not so long ago, Zero Waste living was considered an utopia, today thousands of people have adopted the zero waste lifestyle worldwide, and prove that it is now a reality.Save the Bulk app today! You will make waste-free shopping easy to thousands more, you will stop countless amounts of resources from going to the landfill, and more importantly you'll take part in building a waste-free world for future generations!---(FR)Pourquoi notre appli BULK a t'elle besoin d'être sauvée?  Ceux qui ont telechargé la version Android l'auront déjà remarqué: elle ne marche plus sur cette plateforme.

</div></div>","The first large-scale AC electric generating plant in history,
based on the inventions and patents of Nikola Tesla, was housed in this
120-year-old stone building still standing at Niagara Falls, NY. We plan to acquire the structure and property and turn it into a museum honoring the life
and work of Nikola Tesla, educating the eight million tourists who visit
Niagara Falls every year about his great vision and extraordinary contributions
to the human race, and we are asking for your help.The building pictured above, the future home of the Nikola Tesla Museum, is formally named the Adams Transformer House, after one of Tesla's investors. Tesla himself supervised the design and construction of the facility. On November 16, 1896, a switch was thrown from this location that started the delivery of hydropower to an industrial center. For the first time in history, AC electricity was sent over a long distance (over 32 Km, or 20 miles) to power factories and an electric trolley at Buffalo, NY.Today, nearly all of the electricity in the world is generated, transmitted and turned back into mechanical power by means of inventions, systems and innovations created by internationally-renowned genius and inventor Nikola Tesla. You can read about his life and contributions on Wikipedia and our official website, www.TeslaNiagara.org.On January 12, 2015, Tesla at Niagara Museum received its formal charter from the State of New York, USA.

</p><p>I am Delphine Robbe, french living in Gili
Trawangan, Indonesia, for the last 12 years. I am the project manager and
coordinator of a local NGO: Yayasan Ekosistem Gili Indah or Gili Eco Trust. I
work with all my heart and passion for this little island! Many projects are
successful such as Biorock reef restoration, mooring buoys, cat and horse
clinics, renewable energy development, education and socialisation of the local
community about the importance of caring for their environment for a
sustainable future. </p>
<p>Our
priority for the last few years is RUBBISH... </p>
<p>We (Gili
Eco Trust, Head of village, APGT Asosiasi Pengusaha Gili Trawangan, Bank Sampah
Bintang Sejahtera, Front Masyarakat Peduli Lingkungan) are now starting a new
system of waste management and in paralele an education campaign towards ZERO
WASTE, which will ensure jobs and money for locals and a clean island free of
plastic and rubbish as an example of ecotourism.</p>
<p>Gili Trawangan is drowning under rubbish as
no proper waste management plan in place. We have started a new system of
collection and socialization to get everyone to separate their rubbish so we
can set up an organic garden from organic (wet) rubbish, and we want to set up
a ""rubbish Bank"" for the local community to bring us their rubbish
and get money in return. We need funds to set up facilities that we will allow us to bring most of the rubbish to Lombok for recycling and use a rich compost for planting on Gili.<br/></p>
<p>We have received funds to set up the
facilities but now we are running out of money to keep on building, employing more staff and get more horses. As we have spent so much money to start the new system (boxes,
education, press machine), please help, so we can run everything smoothly and
successfully.</p>
<p>Roof, floor, compartments for ""rubbish
bank"": US$ 20,000</p>
<p>Machines: Press*4, Plastic shredding*2,
Organic rubbish cutter*2, scales *4: US$ 30,000</p>
<p>Electricity+water installation: US$ 2,500, </p>
<p>Composting facilities+organic garden: 15,000,
</p>
<p>Boat to transport rubbish to main land:
12,000, </p>

<p>Office and rooms to rent 1 year: 12,000, </p>
<p>Staff salaries 1 year: 32,000, </p>
<p>Organic rubbish boxes and rubbish bins:
15,500</p>
<p>We need to get the Rubbish Bank facilities
running as soon as possible so we can get some income and support local
community by offering them a way to make money by cleaning their island. Boat
and machinery are the most important goal for now to get some money in as well
as cleaning the island. We have the boat, but no staff yet and we need to install the machinery in the new building which is not finished to be built.<br/></p>
<p>We also need funding to set the organic
garden from composting the organic rubbish (felita system: anaerobic
fermentation of the organic rubbish) that the local community and businesses
separate, and that we collect. We need to be able to spread the campaign to the
whole island: distributing rubbish bins for inorganic rubbish and boxes for
organic rubbish, training everyone about wet and dry rubbish, controlling,
giving prizes and awards to the best eco-warriors every month. We also need to
have more horse karts or some solar power golf karts to organize a daily
efficient rubbish collection.</p>
<p>With YOUR HELP, we will be able to set up the
facilities and to run them straight away at a full potential rather than being
half of our time trying to find money and the other half of the time trying to
run the waste management plan.</p>
<p>We cant wait anymore and so we need your help to build the
facilities to run our plan to its full potential to ensure an popular tourist
destination island free of smell and free of rubbish!</p>
<p>We have been working so many years on that
project, and it is NOW that we can see that with your help we can success. We
have a plan, job description and budget for a sustainable future of this little
island.</p>
<p>The only risks are if people give up and stop
working for us! but every meetings, we keep on saying ""tidak boleh
gagal"" which means NOT ALLOWED OF GIVING UP.</p>
<p>We are about 25 people working now, and we
want to expand to 40 to 50 people. These people are taking their job seriously
and do not want to fail as this is the only way to save the island from
becoming another tourist destination spoiled by rubbish.</p>
<p>If you cannot give us money, please contact
us to come and help! there is always a way to help! on site or from home!</p>

<h3>Locoal Charcoal</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Petey!  I was born and raised in Austin, now living in paradise on the lower Colorado River.  Watching this city grow has made me aware of all the organic waste going to our landfills, so I have been diverting it to create premium products.  My growth has allowed me to work closely with the City of Austin and University of Texas to demonstrate how we can make Austin the first carbon neutral city in North America. </p>
<ul>
<li>I started this mission after an evening under a 180 year Native Pecan Tree.  After asking her what her favorite band was, she replied the ""Almond"" Brothers and our relationship was established.  I give her special thanks for the origin, and for most of the inspiration, I added the perspiration.</li>
<li>I have personally built a fleet of homemade retorts by diverting oil drums from the landfill, and have been producing daily for 8 months.  These retorts are unable to keep up with the demand and I need a commercial retort.  With a retort mounted on a trailer I can take it to waste locations and further reduce the carbon footprint coming from the development of Austin.</li>
<li>This campaign is designed to be a value driven crowd sourcing where you believe enough in me and my products to pre-purchase, to then be fulfilled at a later date.  I will be working with a fulfillment company that will ship charcoal to fans across the nation.</li>
<li>There is too much organic waste going into the landfills, and I need your help to finance a commercial retort to offset as much as I can.  This cannot be accomplished without your help.</li>
<li><p>My lump is a premium hardwood charcoal that lights faster and burns hotter and cleaner for a premium grilling experience.  You don't need any chemicals to start it, and it burns at a much higher temperature to better sear your meats to maintain the moisture.</p></li>
<li><p>My biochar is a premium hardwood charcoal that has numerous gardening benefits including moisture and nutrient retention and a habitat for beneficial bacteria.  One gram of biochar has the surface area of a tennis court, and helps plants grow bigger and healthier.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>I need a larger retort to produce more charcoal.</h3>
<ul><li>A commercial retort mounted on a trailer costs $20,000.  This retort would be able to produce hundreds of pounds of charcoal daily and divert over 2 tons of waste per week. </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>I have already offset thousands of pounds of organic waste from the landfill, and have developed relationships to provide a solution for dozens of dumpsters of organic materials to be diverted each week. </li>
<li>Each bag of Lump charcoal diverts 4 pounds of waste from the landfill. </li>
<li>Each Cubic yard of biochar diverts nearly a half ton of organic waste from the landfill.</li>
<li>Biochar stores carbon in the soil for decades.   In addition to the benefits to the plants and water ways, carbon in a physical form will not be released into the air as a greenhouse gas.</li>
<li>The Locoal mission:  Waste diversion, methane elimination and carbon sequestering while producing premium products. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I was laid off last fall and I have put my blood, heart, sweat and savings into this business.  Developing a brand, filing a trademark, networking sales and waste channels all while crafting a premium product has reinforced my beliefs, but I need your help to make my dreams come true.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the past 8 months I have been waking up with the drive of diverting waste.  Starting my morning chopping wood, eliminating greenhouse gases and producing charcoal, each ax swing inches closer to my goals of waste reduction and education of alternate waste solutions.  I believe in my charcoal so much I have been brushing my teeth with it. </li>
<li>I have sold over 100 units without any negative feedback and great grilling results.  However, scaling to more markets will require larger production. </li>
<li>A commercial retort can process 2 cubic yards of waste per day and create hundreds of units of lump charcoal, or equivalent of dozens of cubic feet of biochar. </li>
<li>Locoal products will be sold across Central Texas and provide a superior solution for grilling, gardening and greening our communities.</li>
<li>Locoal will plant 100 trees yearly to strive to be carbon negative. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you grill, do you garden, do you want to save the world?  Know anyone that does?  Please tell them about my mission and how they can help.</li>
<li>Please share across all your social media platforms. I will be adding videos explaining the process and products, quotes and inspiration from the trees, and fun tidbits and images from my day.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>This is a huge opportunity to pre-purchase a premium product to help me see my dream through.  I'm not only the owner of Locoal Charcoal, I use my products for keeping my fridge fresh, grilling, cleaning water, growing better plants, drawing, and brushing my teeth.</p></div>","Locoal Charcoal

I have sold over 100 units without any negative feedback and great grilling results.  However, scaling to more markets will require larger production. 
A commercial retort can process 2 cubic yards of waste per day and create hundreds of units of lump charcoal, or equivalent of dozens of cubic feet of biochar. 
Locoal products will be sold across Central Texas and provide a superior solution for grilling, gardening and greening our communities.
Locoal will plant 100 trees yearly to strive to be carbon negative. 


Other Ways You Can Help

Do you grill, do you garden, do you want to save the world?  Know anyone that does?  Please tell them about my mission and how they can help.
Please share across all your social media platforms. I will be adding videos explaining the process and products, quotes and inspiration from the trees, and fun tidbits and images from my day.

This is a huge opportunity to pre-purchase a premium product to help me see my dream through.  I'm not only the owner of Locoal Charcoal, I use my products for keeping my fridge fresh, grilling, cleaning water, growing better plants, drawing, and brushing my teeth.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In remote areas, where there is no regular garbage pick-up or sewage treatment, many indigenous and local people burn their waste (i.e. plastic, glass, metals, rubber). But burning releases greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere and can trigger forest fires during the dry season.</p><p><i>Até onde vai o lixo? Infelizmente, lugares isolados na Amazônia brasileira já têm problemas de lixo. Em áreas remotas, onde não há nenhum tipo de saneamento básico, muitas comunidades indígenas e tradicionais queimam seus resíduos (ex.: plástico, vidro, metais, borracha). Mas a queima desses materiais emite gases de efeito estufa (GEEs) na atmosfera e pode desencadear incêndios florestais durante a estação seca.</i></p><h2><strong>Who is affected? </strong></h2><h2><i><strong>Quem é afetado?</strong></i></h2><p>The Yawanawá people live in the Indigenous Land of Rio Gregório (Gregory River), in the Brazilian state of Acre, Tarauacá Municipality. Around 700 Yawanawá people live in eight communities along the banks of the Gregory River. Contact with Western society 200 years ago completely altered their way of life and widespread deforestation has driven the local environment to its breaking point, also bringing new types of waste. This is threatening their wellbeing, affecting livelihoods and causing health problems. The Mutum community is very open to visitors from all over the world who come to learn about their traditional knowledge and to participate in their healing spiritual rituals. Unfortunately, they also bring with them a lot of waste, contaminating the community’s surroundings.</p><p><i>Os Yawanawá vivem na Terra Indígena do Rio Gregório, no estado do Acre, município de Tarauacá. Cerca de 700 indígenas Yawanawá vivem em oito comunidades ao longo das margens do Rio Gregório. O contato com a sociedade ocidental há 200 anos atrás alterou completamente o modo de vida dos Yawanawá e o desmatamento generalizado levou o ambiente local a seu ponto de ruptura, trazendo novos tipos de lixo. Isso está ameaçando o bem-estar dos Yawanawá, afetando seus meios de subsistência e causando problemas de saúde. A comunidade do Mutum é aberta para visitantes de todo o mundo que querem aprender sobre conhecimentos tradicionais e participar de rituais espirituais de cura. Infelizmente, eles trazem consigo muito lixo, contaminando o ambiente da comunidade.</i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497111018/wgqipqvyaqvgj6slkfjb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><p> </p><h2>Let’s help the Mutum community get to zero waste!</h2><h2><i>Vamos ajudar a comunidade do Mutum a se tornar lixo zero!</i></h2><p>In February we went to Mutum village to learn more about how they managed their waste. One of the most worrying things we found was the amount of used batteries scattered in the forest and river. Why so many? The Yawanawá rely on hunting for subsistence, and each hunter uses six large batteries every night in their torches. Villagers are generally unaware of how toxic batteries are to both humans and nature. They can cause soil and water pollution and endanger wildlife. When thrown into the rivers they can bio-accumulate in fish, which reduces their numbers and makes them unfit for human consumption. Mutum village will be the pilot project of the community zero waste initiative, and we plan to integrate what we learn into all other Yawanawá villages. Since Mutum is located eight hours by boat from São Vicente village – where the nearest waste disposal facilities are – transportation is key. But first we need to collaborate with the villagers on a waste management plan that everyone can agree to.</p><p><i>Em Fevereiro nós fomos à aldeia do Mutum aprender mais sobre os resíduos. Uma das coisas mais preocupantes que encontramos foi a quantidade de baterias que são descartadas na floresta e no rio. Por que tantas? Os Yawanawá dependem da caça para a subsistência, e cada caçador usa seis baterias grandes por noite em suas lanternas. Os moradores da comunidade não têm conhecimento sobre as toxinas geradas pelas baterias para a saúde e para a natureza. Elas podem causar a poluição do solo e da água e pôr em perigo a vida selvagem. Quando jogadas nos rios podem bio-acumular nos peixes, o que os reduz em quantidade e os torna impróprios para o consumo humano.

But with your support its possible to help one community transform itself into the first zero-waste village in the Amazon. Diferentes resíduos sólidos estão sendo acumulados em aldeias indígenas da Floresta Amazônica brasileira, ameaçando a saúde dos povos indígenas e o meio ambiente. Mas, com o seu apoio, é possível ajudar uma comunidade a se transformar na primeira aldeia lixo zero da Amazônia.The problemO problemaHow far into the wilderness does garbage reach? Sadly, isolated places in the Brazilian Amazon already have waste problems. In remote areas, where there is no regular garbage pick-up or sewage treatment, many indigenous and local people burn their waste (i.e. plastic, glass, metals, rubber). But burning releases greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere and can trigger forest fires during the dry season.Até onde vai o lixo? Infelizmente, lugares isolados na Amazônia brasileira já têm problemas de lixo. Em áreas remotas, onde não há nenhum tipo de saneamento básico, muitas comunidades indígenas e tradicionais queimam seus resíduos (ex.: plástico, vidro, metais, borracha). Mas a queima desses materiais emite gases de efeito estufa (GEEs) na atmosfera e pode desencadear incêndios florestais durante a estação seca.Who is affected? Quem é afetado?The Yawanawá people live in the Indigenous Land of Rio Gregório (Gregory River), in the Brazilian state of Acre, Tarauacá Municipality. Around 700 Yawanawá people live in eight communities along the banks of the Gregory River. Contact with Western society 200 years ago completely altered their way of life and widespread deforestation has driven the local environment to its breaking point, also bringing new types of waste. This is threatening their wellbeing, affecting livelihoods and causing health problems. The Mutum community is very open to visitors from all over the world who come to learn about their traditional knowledge and to participate in their healing spiritual rituals. Unfortunately, they also bring with them a lot of waste, contaminating the community’s surroundings.Os Yawanawá vivem na Terra Indígena do Rio Gregório, no estado do Acre, município de Tarauacá. Cerca de 700 indígenas Yawanawá vivem em oito comunidades ao longo das margens do Rio Gregório. O contato com a sociedade ocidental há 200 anos atrás alterou completamente o modo de vida dos Yawanawá e o desmatamento generalizado levou o ambiente local a seu ponto de ruptura, trazendo novos tipos de lixo. Isso está ameaçando o bem-estar dos Yawanawá, afetando seus meios de subsistência e causando problemas de saúde. A comunidade do Mutum é aberta para visitantes de todo o mundo que querem aprender sobre conhecimentos tradicionais e participar de rituais espirituais de cura. Infelizmente, eles trazem consigo muito lixo, contaminando o ambiente da comunidade. Let’s help the Mutum community get to zero waste!Vamos ajudar a comunidade do Mutum a se tornar lixo zero!In February we went to Mutum village to learn more about how they managed their waste. One of the most worrying things we found was the amount of used batteries scattered in the forest and river. Why so many? The Yawanawá rely on hunting for subsistence, and each hunter uses six large batteries every night in their torches. Villagers are generally unaware of how toxic batteries are to both humans and nature. They can cause soil and water pollution and endanger wildlife. When thrown into the rivers they can bio-accumulate in fish, which reduces their numbers and makes them unfit for human consumption. Mutum village will be the pilot project of the community zero waste initiative, and we plan to integrate what we learn into all other Yawanawá villages. Since Mutum is located eight hours by boat from São Vicente village – where the nearest waste disposal facilities are – transportation is key. But first we need to collaborate with the villagers on a waste management plan that everyone can agree to.Em Fevereiro nós fomos à aldeia do Mutum aprender mais sobre os resíduos. Uma das coisas mais preocupantes que encontramos foi a quantidade de baterias que são descartadas na floresta e no rio. Por que tantas? Os Yawanawá dependem da caça para a subsistência, e cada caçador usa seis baterias grandes por noite em suas lanternas. Os moradores da comunidade não têm conhecimento sobre as toxinas geradas pelas baterias para a saúde e para a natureza. Elas podem causar a poluição do solo e da água e pôr em perigo a vida selvagem. Quando jogadas nos rios podem bio-acumular nos peixes, o que os reduz em quantidade e os torna impróprios para o consumo humano. A aldeia do Mutum será o projeto piloto da iniciativa aldeia lixo zero, mas futuramente planejamos integrar todas as outras comunidades da tribo Yawanawá. Uma vez que a aldeia do Mutum está a oito horas de barco da vila de São Vicente - onde estão as instalações de eliminação de resíduos mais próximas - o transporte é essencial para tornar a aldeia lixo zero. Mas primeiro precisamos colaborar com os moradores da aldeia em um plano de gerenciamento de resíduos que todos possam participar.Here’s what we will do:O que vamos fazer:- Work with families living in Mutum and with leaders from other Yawanawá communities to raise awareness about the dangers of disposing of waste in the forest- Build local skills in how to reduce, reuse and recycle specific materials and how to compost organic waste- Organize a community cleanup- Purchase a motor boat to take solid wastes to São Vicente and fuel for 2 years- Build a waste station in the Mutum community- Supply 27 families with solar flashlights and reusable batteries that can be recharged throughout the day- Give each household a set of containers for different types of waste (compost, recyclable, toxic, etc.) and offer training in how to sort them- Set up a village composting system- Put up zero waste signs throughout Mutum to inform visitors- Build a waste station in the village of São Vicente- Mediate with state agents of Tarauacá and Cruzeiro do Sul municipalities and the residents of São Vicente to better organize the disposal and recycling of solid waste. - Trabalhar com as famílias que moram no Mutum e com líderes de outras comunidades Yawanawá para aumentar a conscientização sobre os perigos do descarte de resíduos na floresta- Capacitar os moradores sobre como reduzir, reutilizar e reciclar resíduos sólidos e sobre a compostagem de resíduos orgânicos- Organizar uma limpeza da aldeia- Comprar um barco a motor para levar resíduos sólidos para São Vicente e combustível para 2 anos- Construir uma estação de lixo na aldeia do Mutum- Fornecer para as 27 famílias do Mutum lanternas solares e baterias reutilizáveis que podem ser recarregados ao longo do dia- Dar a cada família um conjunto de latas para diferentes tipos de resíduos (composto, reciclável, tóxico, etc.) e prover as informações necessárias sobre como separá-los- Instalar um sistema de compostagem na aldeia- Colocar placas informativas de aldeia lixo zero no Mutum para informar os visitantes- Construir uma estação de resíduos na aldeia de São Vicente- Mediar com agentes do governo municipal de Tarauacá, os moradores de São Vicente e do governo municipal de Cruzeiro do Sul para melhor organizar a destinação e a reciclagem de resíduos sólidos.Healing ourselves by healing our environmentCurando a nós mesmos pela cura do meio ambienteThe Yawanawá live in a part of the Amazon forest that is rich in biodiversity and home to myriad healing plants.

in the form of an island. This island will also
serve as our concert stage.

Each owner of a Villa has the right
to use his villa 1 month per year after arrangement with naya,
whilst for the remaining 11 months
naya will rent them out for their customers and/or retreats.
Once naya has been fully operational
for one year, owners will then be entitled to 20% of the rental income for one year 
from
the 2nd year on 30% 
and from the 4th year on 40% ongoing.
the interest rate will be between 4 % and 7 % per year on a calculated 

utilisation of 50%.

The total time for construction
will be approximately 3 years.


Naya will take care of all
running costs, taxes and maintenance expenses.

<p>
In keeping with my moneyless existence <b>I won’t be asking for payment from my visitors</b>, instead they can offer as much (or as little) as they want or can afford. Preferably in the form of barter or by helping out around the place. </p>

<p>Since the beginning of the industrial revolution we have spent more than 135 billion tons of oil in the last 150
years. What’s more, our demands for oil are still only increasing. Oil is of tremendous
importance in our everyday life, but it is difficult to obtain. The
multinationals that assume the risks and responsibilities associated with that
also gain the ability to monopolize it, making it unequally accessible. </p>
<p>More
importantly, oil is a non-renewable source and some projections say we only
have enough for the next 40 years! Even so, we use it for almost everything:
for transport, energy production, in pharmacy, for building artificial
materials and much more... Life as we know it today is simply not possible
without oil. Therefore it is crucial to find an ecologically friendly,
self-sustainable and globally accessible alternative for obtaining fuels. Here is where our idea comes in!</p>
<h4><b>Why biobutanol?</b></h4>
<p>Because of its chemical structure, butanol is very
similar to conventional fuels and consequently a perfect replacement for them.
It can be used in eternal combustion engines without modifying them. This means
we could use it to fuel our cars with no modifications required! </p>
<h4><b>How can we obtain biobutanol?</b></h4>Turns out we can
produce it from organic waste! In anaerobic conditions we can transform organic
waste to biogas (to be used as energy source on its own) and butanoic acid. We
can then take the butanoic acid and transform it into biobutanol with the use of
microorganisms. The method is completely safe to people and to the environment as
the microorganisms are contained and carefully controlled. <b style=""background-color: initial;"">And thus instead of

<h4><b>Sap Tai</b></h4>
<p>Sap Tai community lays
on the very edge of the <b>Khao Yai National park</b>, which is Thailand’s oldest
(since 1962) and largest national park (2,168 km<sup>2</sup>). The park is a
<b>UNESCO</b> world heritage site and is an important tropical forest ecosystem. It
provides home for over 3000 species of plants, 250 birds and 67 mammals – some
of them critically endangered. But the mountainous Khao Yai also has a dark
side – it has a history of poaching, land encroachment, illegal logging and
unsustainable agricultural practices. All this had a detrimental effect on primary
forest, which also led to <b>soil erosion</b>, <b>landslides</b>, <b>flooding</b> and <b>droughts</b>.
There is an urgent need for <b>forest restoration</b>, conservation and education to reverse
the current trend of habitat degradation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436436909/swyabkdn1tjuszc7t0gm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Local people in Sap
Tai community are experiencing the effects of this degradation (especially
drought), and therefore decided to make a change and protect the existing
forests while also create new ones. This will not only provide them with
<b>sustainable livelihoods</b>, but will also present a <b>healthy habitat </b>for the wild
elephants and other wildlife living in this area. But in order to achieve this,
they need your help.</p>

<h4><b>Tree planting

<p>PATT Foundation will
help the Sap Tai community to create a healthy forest ecosystem. We will <b>restore
the forest</b>, not just reforest! This means that we will re-establish the
entire forest ecosystems as similar as possible to the original forest
ecosystem which was present before the deforestation occurred. </p>
<p>PATT
Foundation works closely with the Forestry Research &amp; Restoration Unit
FORRU, which has undertaken ground-breaking research on the best methods to
restore native forests in Thailand. As such we follow their framework species
method of forest restoration - this involves the planting of 20-30 indigenous
tree species specially selected for their ability to rapidly shade out weeds
and attract seed-dispersing wildlife. Birds and mammals, attracted to the
plots, bring with them the seeds of many other forest trees and thus help to
re-establish a species-rich forest tree community similar to that of the
original forest.</p>
<p>PATT
will provide tree seedlings from our own tree nursery in Khao Yai, which serves
as an environmental education facility and also provides <b>employment to Sap Tai people</b> - it hires 3 full
time and up to 20 casual local Thai staff to undertake various aspects of our
reforestation work. Beside tree planting and nursery activities they will also do
the <b>aftercare</b> of the newly planted trees in this project for another 2-3 years

PATT Foundation is planting trees in Thailand’s biggest and
oldest national park Khao Yai already for 10 years. But this year is special -
it is the first time that the local Sap Tai community is experiencing water
scarcity. There is not enough water even to sufficiently water the
essential food crops. 
This shows that
climate is changing in Khao Yai, but we won’t just watch it happen. We would
like to help the local community and plant 100 native trees with
them on the Zero Emissions Day to raise awareness for climate change and
ensure sufficient water supply for the next year. We will also hire local Thai
staff to provide 2-3 years of aftercare for the planted trees to ensure their
successful growth.


The planted trees in
Sap Tai will:



Provide home for the
wild elephants living in the area


Protect Sap Tai
watershed and prevent water scarcity


Present an extra
income for the Sap Tai community


Absorb carbon dioxide
and mitigate climate change


Prevent soil erosion


Local Sap Tai
community doesn’t have enough resources to finance their watershed protection project
that is why we ask for your help. Help us protect the water sources of
the Sap Tai community with this sustainable forest restoration, and at the same
time you’ll also offset your carbon footprint.






Why trees?

 

Trees are mitigating drought
Not only are trees an
effective means for absorbing and storing the carbon you emit, trees also help
us to adapt to a changing climate and combat drought by:



Influencing
rainfall patterns - trees humidify air
and maintain rain cycle, their leaves act as interceptors, catching falling
rain, which then evaporates causing rain precipitation - a process known as
evapo-transpiration. Trees can evapo-transpirate twice as much as agricultural
crops and about twice as much as water body surfaces.


Regulating
river flows both during dry
seasons and high rainfall events, thereby minimizing risks related to water
scarcity and floods.


Reducing
water evaporation by cooling the air and
shading the ground.


Increasing
water saturation into groundwater thus reducing water runoff. Tree roots and leaf litter create
soil conditions that promote the infiltration of rainwater into the soil. This
helps to replenish the groundwater supply and maintain streamflow during dry
periods.


Increasing
underground water reserves
- strategic planting of trees can increase level of groundwater as numerous
studies have already shown.


Furthermore, only native tree species will be used in Sap Tai community as
they have low rate of transpiration and high rate of groundwater recharge in this environment. 

“As the climate
changes, severe droughts are likely to become more common, and we shouldn’t
miss the opportunities to influence the hydrologic cycle in a beneficial way
using trees” says David Ellison   from the Institute for World Economics.

</div><div> </div></div>","Cooking Shouldn't Kill Whether it's a weekend barbecue or roasting marshmallows on a camping trip, cooking over an open fire is a novelty that many Americans enjoy.
But for nearly half the world's population, building and maintaining a fire is a daily -- and often deadly -- chore.
In remote villages and city slums, women tend to fires for hours on end, breathing in smoke that is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, according to the World Health Organization. Many of these women have their children close by or strapped to their chest or back, and the dangerous pollutants from the smoke can result in severe damage to their lungs as well. 
""Give a man a
fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a
lifetime.""

My name is Yusuf Tura and I am a social entrepreneur
originally from  Africa who is trying to turn this vision into a reality. I
was forced to leave my homeland as a child because of war conflict and when I
finally got the opportunity to come back I was saddened by how open-fire cooking is destroying lives and the environment.
I found that deforestation and air pollution have reached
alarming rates which put everyone's health in danger but especially dangerous
for the small children.

</div><p><b>The
Project in Brief</b></p><div>
</div><p>Based in the United Kingdom our
small team of experienced traders has found that there is a huge potential for
selling bird’s food, especially for wild birds. Attracting wild birds to your
garden or back yard gives you peaceful environment and takes you
closer to the nature in the heart of the busy cities. Just imagine hearing the
calming birds’ songs at your home or the wondering of your children when they
find gaily-coloured birds on the trees around you. </p><div>
</div><p>Providing rich proteins and quality
food is very important for wild birds. They grow healthy and much more
beautiful. Even their songs sound better. </p><div>
</div><p>It is important for them to have
quality food even in the winter season. Protein supply is essential for every
single bird to survive in the cold winter also it is for the breeding period. </p><div>
</div><p>This is in a few words our idea
which we would like to make popular. Creating nature friendly environment will
be the most valuable benefit for the many local communities in the UK. </p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436042774/daqvnufuwb1ulm2y8znd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<br/>
</div><p><b>How
We Can Do This</b></p><div>
</div><p>Being experienced with trading
different goods and commodities we have good and reliable connections with
farmers around the Europe. Dealing directly with them will give us the
advantage of lower commodity price; together with the short distance for
delivery we would be competitive on the market. The project idea is to import
different seeds and grains which wild birds love to eat, selling them directly
to households or suppling zoo-stores. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Stage 1</b> Establish contacts with farmers of oil seeds and grains –
We have already done this and we have made very attractive prices with farmers
– in return they have guaranteed market for their production. The first focus
will be sunflower seeds and corn which are some of the favorite wild birds’ food. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Stage 2</b> Provide a storage space - warehouse. We will need to rent a
warehouse to stock the seeds and to be able to import bigger quantity in order
to keep the price lower. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Stage 3</b> Ensure the local deliveries. Buying our own van for local
deliveries is essential to keep low operational costs and to avoid courier
services. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Stage 4</b> Web-site. Presenting our business on the World Wild Web is
one of the most important jobs to do. This is how we are going to boost on-line
sales and will advertise our enterprise. </p><div>
</div><p><b>What Do We Need</b></p><div>
</div><p>The total investment we need to
realize this idea is: 55 000 £ or approximately 75 000 €. All the contributions
made will go for covering the following expenses: </p><div>
</div><ul>
<li>Professional web-site </li>
<li>Buying a van</li>
<li>Renting a warehouse</li>
<li>Buying seeds – to be able to make the idea massive enough will have to import at least 3-4 containers (approximately 24 000kg each) of seeds to place ourselves on the market. </li>
</ul><div>
</div><p>If we receive more contributions
than needed – we will increase the trading volume. </p><div>
</div><p>If we do not receive the
contributions needed – we will have to reduce the trading volume. </p><div>
</div><p><b>The
Benefits</b></p><div>
</div><p><b>Locally</b>: That will establish nice and peaceful environment. It will
cultivate more nature friendly personality. And will be a great experience for
everybody especially for the kids giving them memorable moments. </p><div>
</div><p>Apart of these personal benefits we
are going to employee 3-5 people in the area – van driver, warehouse workers
and web-site administrator. </p><div>
</div><p>As a part of our business we plan to
get a Council permission to place wild bird feeders in parks. And we will
provide seeds on weekly basis. That will attract more birds in the parks. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Globally:</b> Because we believe that goodness must pass from hand to
hand we are going to establish a fund for supporting different causes and
ideas. Every six months we are going to allocate between 0.3
and 0.5 percent from our turnover (which will be approximately 5% of the gross
profit) for supporting people with dreams and valuable ideas, also we will
be more than happy to support different causes. </p><div>
</div><p>We have found in our experience that
funding your bright ideas is not that easy as it is written in the books.
Financial organizations will ask you to secure the investments and personal

</div></div>","The
Project in Brief
Based in the United Kingdom our
small team of experienced traders has found that there is a huge potential for
selling bird’s food, especially for wild birds. Attracting wild birds to your
garden or back yard gives you peaceful environment and takes you
closer to the nature in the heart of the busy cities. Just imagine hearing the
calming birds’ songs at your home or the wondering of your children when they
find gaily-coloured birds on the trees around you. 
Providing rich proteins and quality
food is very important for wild birds. They grow healthy and much more
beautiful. Even their songs sound better. 
It is important for them to have
quality food even in the winter season. Protein supply is essential for every
single bird to survive in the cold winter also it is for the breeding period. 
This is in a few words our idea
which we would like to make popular. Creating nature friendly environment will
be the most valuable benefit for the many local communities in the UK. 



How
We Can Do This
Being experienced with trading
different goods and commodities we have good and reliable connections with
farmers around the Europe. Dealing directly with them will give us the
advantage of lower commodity price; together with the short distance for
delivery we would be competitive on the market. The project idea is to import
different seeds and grains which wild birds love to eat, selling them directly
to households or suppling zoo-stores. 
Stage 1 Establish contacts with farmers of oil seeds and grains –
We have already done this and we have made very attractive prices with farmers
– in return they have guaranteed market for their production. The first focus
will be sunflower seeds and corn which are some of the favorite wild birds’ food. 
Stage 2 Provide a storage space - warehouse. We will need to rent a
warehouse to stock the seeds and to be able to import bigger quantity in order
to keep the price lower. 
Stage 3 Ensure the local deliveries. Buying our own van for local
deliveries is essential to keep low operational costs and to avoid courier
services. 
Stage 4 Web-site. Presenting our business on the World Wild Web is
one of the most important jobs to do. This is how we are going to boost on-line
sales and will advertise our enterprise. 
What Do We Need
The total investment we need to
realize this idea is: 55 000 £ or approximately 75 000 €. All the contributions
made will go for covering the following expenses: 

Professional web-site 
Buying a van
Renting a warehouse
Buying seeds – to be able to make the idea massive enough will have to import at least 3-4 containers (approximately 24 000kg each) of seeds to place ourselves on the market. 

If we receive more contributions
than needed – we will increase the trading volume. 
If we do not receive the
contributions needed – we will have to reduce the trading volume. 
The
Benefits
Locally: That will establish nice and peaceful environment. It will
cultivate more nature friendly personality. And will be a great experience for
everybody especially for the kids giving them memorable moments. 
Apart of these personal benefits we
are going to employee 3-5 people in the area – van driver, warehouse workers
and web-site administrator. 
As a part of our business we plan to
get a Council permission to place wild bird feeders in parks. And we will
provide seeds on weekly basis. That will attract more birds in the parks. 
Globally: Because we believe that goodness must pass from hand to
hand we are going to establish a fund for supporting different causes and
ideas. Every six months we are going to allocate between 0.3
and 0.5 percent from our turnover (which will be approximately 5% of the gross
profit) for supporting people with dreams and valuable ideas, also we will
be more than happy to support different causes. 
We have found in our experience that
funding your bright ideas is not that easy as it is written in the books.
Financial organizations will ask you to secure the investments and personal
investors will ask for huge share of your idea. These circumstances will put
you on the ground and in most of the cases you won’t be able to develop your
idea to the levels you would like to… 
This is why we will be really happy
if we could provide support for resourceful persons to realize their workable
ideas. We will be happy to support them not only with funding but with ideas
and solutions in making their dreams come true. 
Based on our believes and understandings of helping others the
effort is not only to establish a prosperous organization but to build a
profitable structure with ability to allocate funds on regular bases to support
many people and causes for a bright future.

<p><b>We believe in the power of photography; the power to inspire, the power to connect, and the power to change people’s lives. For two weeks in July, we’ll be running a photography workshop with Zambian youths, as part of Greenpop’s eco-education program. </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We’ll be working with ten Zambians between the ages of 19 and 24 who, for various socio-economic issues, have not been able to study at tertiary institutions or find jobs. With a specific focus on the environment, we will teach our participants photography and story-telling skills. We will encourage them to explore the environmental issues facing their region through their lenses, and communicate this story in a powerful way. We’ll also focus on critical thinking,  problem-solving skills, team collaboration, and the contribution they can have to changing communities and environments. </p>

<p>After running a successful pilot last year, this workshop will be the start of an on-going photography program in Livingstone.

</div></div>","Short Summary 
We believe in the power of photography; the power to inspire, the power to connect, and the power to change people’s lives. For two weeks in July, we’ll be running a photography workshop with Zambian youths, as part of Greenpop’s eco-education program. 


We’ll be working with ten Zambians between the ages of 19 and 24 who, for various socio-economic issues, have not been able to study at tertiary institutions or find jobs. With a specific focus on the environment, we will teach our participants photography and story-telling skills. We will encourage them to explore the environmental issues facing their region through their lenses, and communicate this story in a powerful way. We’ll also focus on critical thinking,  problem-solving skills, team collaboration, and the contribution they can have to changing communities and environments. 


The Impact
After running a successful pilot last year, this workshop will be the start of an on-going photography program in Livingstone. Through a continuation of our workshops, we eventually aim to equip young Zambians with skills, connections and resources to study photography or filmmaking, or to gain employment in the creative industry. You can find a full overview of the project here. 
“This project set me on a path I had for so long discarded, which now, I realize, is my true passion. I am saving up because I will be studying film production in London, so with that said, Ilizwi does more for young people than you realize. It will change the lives of many in ways you can not imagine, which is the beauty of it all.” - Emmanuél Wayne, workshop participant, Zambia 


The Collaboration 

This project is a collaboration between Greenpop (an environmental NGO), Ilizwi (a youth development initiative that encourages creative self-expression through photography), and the Penda Trust (an NGO that uses photography to generate positive change in developing countries). The workshop will happen as part of Greenpop Zambia, a Livingstone-based project that works to contribute to a solution to the deforestation and consequent ecological and socio-economic impacts the area is facing. Greenpop is doing this by starting a reforestation process, developing a culture of planting trees within communities, encouraging alternative energy sources, and promoting sustainable forest management. 


  


What We Need The funds raised will go towards: 


Cameras for the participants
Transport during the workshop
Travel costs for the workshop facilitators, who are part of an Ilizwi team from Khayalitsha, Cape Town, and went through the workshop process themselves
Workshop material and stationary 



What You GetIn return for your support, we're exciting to offer you some fun perks! You can choose a print of one of the images that will be taken during the workshop, some traditional Zambian fabric sent to you from Livingstone, or a stunning book on nature photography. You can find the details on the right-hand side.You can also choose a SIGNED print of this stunning image by Jeremy Loops! 



And we're excited to have just added this gorgeous illustration, designed specifically for this campaign by the wonderful Paper Tales. For a contribution of $20, we can offer you a limited edition A4 print of it!

<h3>                         THE PICTURE BOOK</h3>“I AM THE HUGGER!” is one of the picture books I wrote and illustrated for<i> Granny Green’s Green Machine</i>, a non-profit, environmental education program for kids. <p> </p>
<p><i>Granny Green’s Green Machine</i> is an upbeat, amusing and musical look at how children and their grownups can make the world greener, right in their own backyards. With original songs, original picture books, audience participation, and colorful props and puppets made from recycled materials, Granny Green helps children understand how they are connected to the natural world and how they affect it. At the same time, they learn how some of the Earth's cycles and systems work together — just like the parts of a machine!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Along with original songs, I wrote, illustrated and hand-made several picture books for <i>Granny Green’s Green Machine</i>  performances as a way to help me describe Earth systems and sustainable living practices. Other picture books I use in the show include ""The Supercyclers Save Pittsville"", which is about recycling; ""Little Drip Takes a Trip"", which is about the water cycle; and ""Willy The Worm"", which is about composting. Because the response to the books has been so positive, I now need your help to get them published, starting with ""I AM THE HUGGER!"". </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mascot Books, one of the fastest growing independent book publishers in the country, wants to design, print, publish and distribute ""I AM THE HUGGER!"". I need to raise money to cover the costs of publication and promotion of the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A published book will also help promote <i>Granny Green's Green Machine </i>. I'm working with the non-profit, Kids For Earth.org to reach as many schools and events as possible. The Kids For Earth board and I believe that a published book will be a great way to spark the interest of more PTOs, PTAs and school boards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When children understand a concept, they embrace it wholeheartedly. They inevitably ask, “How can I help?”- And if they are entertained along the way, so much the better. The future belongs to them, so it's our job to educate and prepare them for change. You can help with your donation, and by spreading the word about this Indiegogo campaign. It's time for everyone to start hugging more trees!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>                        THE CAMPAIGN GOAL</h3>
<p>My goal for publishing 'I AM THE HUGGER!' is $7,000. $3,750.00 of this amount will go to Mascot Books for the design, printing, publishing and limited distribution of the book. I will receive 1000 copies as part of the agreement. The remaining $3,750, will be used for social media promotion of the book and travel expenses for visits to schools, libraries, bookstores and other interested organizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a donation in any amount you will automatically receive a mention on the <i>Granny Green's Green Machine</i> website, a downloadable <b>coloring page</b>, and a downloadable <b>illustration</b> from ""I AM THE HUGGER!"" The larger your contribution, the more perks offered. Perks for larger donations will include <b>mp3s and CDs</b> of songs from Granny Green's Green Machine, copies of <b>""I AM THE HUGGER!""</b>, and copies of <b><i>Granny Green's Illustrated Ukulele Chord Book</i></b>. Perks are laid out in the Perks section of this webpage, but here are some examples:</p>

<p>If I don't make my goal, the book will still get published, and I'll have to hold back on some of my promotion plans. Success depends so much on promotion, but having a published book to take into schools and libraries will open doors.</p>

</div><div>
<div> </div>
<p><i>From Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary -</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>tree hugger</i></p>
<p><i>noun</i></p>
<p><i>: someone who is regarded as foolish or annoying because of being too concerned about protecting trees, animals, and other parts of the natural world from pollution and other threats</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because so many adults still use the word 'treehugger' as an insult, it allows them to dismiss the fact that environmental problems are not only real, they're very serious and very immediate. Children hear the word used pejoratively and repeat a negative message. ""I AM THE HUGGER!"" can help change attitudes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""I AM THE HUGGER!"" embraces the word with humor and irrefutable facts about the importance of trees. The book's Tree Hugger character is wildly infatuated with trees, and children find that amusing. They're also reminded that trees are essential to life on planet Earth.</p>

<p>I am a professional actor with many New York and regional credits, including The Yale Repertory Theater, The Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Denver Center Theater Company, Goodspeed Opera House and The Papermill Playhouse. I have been performing for children for decades. I performed and developed shows with <i>The Paper Bag Players,</i> and have presented several storytelling and music programs for children in Bergen County, NJ where I live. I am a certified NJ Learns sustainability educator, I've written environmental articles for North Jersey Media's <i>The Suburbanite</i>, and I write an ongoing blog for my Granny Green website. The books I present in <i>Granny Green's Green Machine</i> have gotten a very positive response, and it's now time to publish and promote them, starting with ""I AM THE HUGGER!”</p>

</div></div>","THE PICTURE BOOK“I AM THE HUGGER!” is one of the picture books I wrote and illustrated for Granny Green’s Green Machine, a non-profit, environmental education program for kids.  
Granny Green’s Green Machine is an upbeat, amusing and musical look at how children and their grownups can make the world greener, right in their own backyards. With original songs, original picture books, audience participation, and colorful props and puppets made from recycled materials, Granny Green helps children understand how they are connected to the natural world and how they affect it. At the same time, they learn how some of the Earth's cycles and systems work together — just like the parts of a machine!
 
Along with original songs, I wrote, illustrated and hand-made several picture books for Granny Green’s Green Machine  performances as a way to help me describe Earth systems and sustainable living practices. Other picture books I use in the show include ""The Supercyclers Save Pittsville"", which is about recycling; ""Little Drip Takes a Trip"", which is about the water cycle; and ""Willy The Worm"", which is about composting. Because the response to the books has been so positive, I now need your help to get them published, starting with ""I AM THE HUGGER!"". 
 
Mascot Books, one of the fastest growing independent book publishers in the country, wants to design, print, publish and distribute ""I AM THE HUGGER!"". I need to raise money to cover the costs of publication and promotion of the book.
 
A published book will also help promote Granny Green's Green Machine . I'm working with the non-profit, Kids For Earth.org to reach as many schools and events as possible. The Kids For Earth board and I believe that a published book will be a great way to spark the interest of more PTOs, PTAs and school boards.
 
When children understand a concept, they embrace it wholeheartedly. They inevitably ask, “How can I help?”- And if they are entertained along the way, so much the better. The future belongs to them, so it's our job to educate and prepare them for change. You can help with your donation, and by spreading the word about this Indiegogo campaign. It's time for everyone to start hugging more trees!
 

                        THE CAMPAIGN GOAL
My goal for publishing 'I AM THE HUGGER!' is $7,000. $3,750.00 of this amount will go to Mascot Books for the design, printing, publishing and limited distribution of the book. I will receive 1000 copies as part of the agreement. The remaining $3,750, will be used for social media promotion of the book and travel expenses for visits to schools, libraries, bookstores and other interested organizations.
 
With a donation in any amount you will automatically receive a mention on the Granny Green's Green Machine website, a downloadable coloring page, and a downloadable illustration from ""I AM THE HUGGER!"" The larger your contribution, the more perks offered. Perks for larger donations will include mp3s and CDs of songs from Granny Green's Green Machine, copies of ""I AM THE HUGGER!"", and copies of Granny Green's Illustrated Ukulele Chord Book. Perks are laid out in the Perks section of this webpage, but here are some examples:

 
 
 
 
  


 
 
  
If I don't make my goal, the book will still get published, and I'll have to hold back on some of my promotion plans. Success depends so much on promotion, but having a published book to take into schools and libraries will open doors.
 
 
                                                           WHY THIS BOOK, NOW?

 
From Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary -
 
tree hugger
noun
: someone who is regarded as foolish or annoying because of being too concerned about protecting trees, animals, and other parts of the natural world from pollution and other threats
 
Because so many adults still use the word 'treehugger' as an insult, it allows them to dismiss the fact that environmental problems are not only real, they're very serious and very immediate. Children hear the word used pejoratively and repeat a negative message. ""I AM THE HUGGER!"" can help change attitudes.
 
""I AM THE HUGGER!"" embraces the word with humor and irrefutable facts about the importance of trees. The book's Tree Hugger character is wildly infatuated with trees, and children find that amusing. They're also reminded that trees are essential to life on planet Earth.
 
 
                 
 
                            
I am a professional actor with many New York and regional credits, including The Yale Repertory Theater, The Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Denver Center Theater Company, Goodspeed Opera House and The Papermill Playhouse. I have been performing for children for decades. I performed and developed shows with The Paper Bag Players, and have presented several storytelling and music programs for children in Bergen County, NJ where I live. I am a certified NJ Learns sustainability educator, I've written environmental articles for North Jersey Media's The Suburbanite, and I write an ongoing blog for my Granny Green website. The books I present in Granny Green's Green Machine have gotten a very positive response, and it's now time to publish and promote them, starting with ""I AM THE HUGGER!”
 
In September of 2014, I self-published another picture book - ""The Dance of the Seahorses"" as an Amazon e-book, and plan to publish a print version soon.

world’s greatest achievements often start with a seemingly crazy idea. A dream
so big it challenges people to reconsider what is possible. During great
advancements such as the first powered flight or landing on the moon, the
average person was merely a bystander. This amazing project allows you to
be directly involved in achieving the world’s next great scientific
milestone -- solving world hunger. </b><br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our modern world is a
truly amazing place. We can answer calls from our wrist watch, track calories
and have cars that park themselves, yet we still don’t have a viable solution
to solve world hunger and famine.  The
Kingdom of North Sudan, the world’s newest nation, hopes to solve this problem
with your assistance and fiscal sponsorship. In creating a new country, we have
the opportunity to make it something truly extraordinary: a nation fully
dedicated to researching and developing solutions for our current global food
shortages and impending food crisis. </p>

<blockquote><b>""Rather than handouts, Africa needs capital investment, entrepreneurial innovation and free trade. Mr. Heaton understands this. The journey that started with a little girl’s dream is still that, but dreams can be seedbeds of massive change. ""<br/>— Lawrence J. McQuillan  The Independent Institute</b></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>In supporting the North Sudan Scientific Fund, you
will be contributing to the world’s largest scientific effort for finding a
better way to grow <span>and distribute food.  </span></p>
<p><span>With your help we’ll be able to put a team together that will help us develop the structure and technology needed to revolutionize the agricultural industry. By having a clean slate, 800 square miles of land, we will work with top notch scientists to build a sustainable and efficient farming system. We’ve developed a 5-year plan so that we can accomplish this goal. Below you will find more details of what it all entails.  <br/></span></p>
<h2><b>How did this idea start? </b></h2>
<p>Like most things in life<span>,
this project originated from the most unlikely of places: a six-year old little
girl’s request to her father.  You see, my little girl Emily asked if she
would ever be a real princess one day. Like any father would do, I told her she
could be anything she wanted. Her eyes lit up with joy
as she thought about that unexpected possibility. </span></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1176314/files/20150126224211-Princess-Emily-Heaton-009.jpg?1422340931"" src="""" style=""width: 602.966565349544px; height: 362px;""/>
<h3></h3>
<br/>Now most people would have stopped there, but natural curiosity made me
wonder if it might really be possible to make Emily an actual princess. That is when the search to make my little girl’s dream <span>a
reality began. The first step would have to be to find unclaimed,
ungoverned, unpopulated land, and in East Africa I was able to do just that. </span>

<p>With this small act of love, the Kingdom of North
Sudan was created and the news quickly traveled around the world<span>, bringing unexpected “fame” to my average and humble family.  But this, we would
soon discover, was just the beginning.</span></p>
<h2><b>The
“Elon Musk Approach” to Agri-Science</b></h2>
<p>Having created the world’s
newest nation in the heart of the east African desert, the question became<span>, “What do we do with it?”  Emily, having learned
about hungry children in Africa from her elementary school teacher, stated very
clearly, “Grow a garden as big as our country to
feed people!""  </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Her simple idea about growing food for people transformed itself into the project you see here today. The revenue generated by this campaign will be used to advance the next great
agricultural revolution. Using the scientific funding methodology pioneered by
Elon Musk (SpaceX and Tesla Motors), we intend
to fully fund the world’s best scientists in a pursuit to identify new, better
ways to grow food using considerably less water, within
a nation whose very existence, laws and regulations will be designed to make it
easier to accomplish such endeavors. All technological advancements will
be provided directly to any other nation, university or corporation, free of charge. 
Such important innovations warrant an open
source mentality, nothing less.</span></p>
<p>Given that the Kingdom of North Sudan is 800 sq. miles in size, it is a blank slate
ready to be developed into a cutting-edge research center for agricultural technology
and energy efficiency. </p>

<p>Human activity over the last few centuries has not
been very kind to our Earth. The repercussions for our past actions are upon
us; we must now improve our relationship with agriculture and water usage.
Conditions are becoming less than ideal in our breadbasket areas across the
globe as crop production suffers due to an increasing lack of water. Much of
the water,<b> approximately 70%, used in agriculture </b><b>is wasted
via runoff or evaporation</b>. This is a considerable amount of waste when one
factors in the fact that agriculture consumes
approximately 70% of the world’s accessible fresh water supply.</p>

<h2><b>What are
the next steps and how will the funds be used: </b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>The North Sudan Scientific
Fund will be used for the development of the Agricultural Research Center;
affectionately called the ARC. The ARC is a modern scientific lifeboat designed
to save lives by unlocking new advances in agriculture: preventing starvation,
hunger and climate related interruptions in the food supply system.  The North Sudan Scientific Fund ARC will
allow the world’s best scientists to conduct meaningful research and
collaborate in a fully-funded laboratory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Building a country from the
ground up is a huge task, and we are aware that there may be unexpected
obstacles, but we have spent time detailing a plan to define what the first
steps are to achieve this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431370561/b3w1iyczy6eeypqbj5xr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Phase 0 – Project Initiation
and Diplomacy</b></p>
<p>The
Kingdom of North Sudan has identified the need for advancement in
agricultural  science that combats the
effects of global warming on crop production. 
The Kingdom of North Sudan seeks to develop an Agricultural Research
Center (ARC) designed to house scientists, all necessary complementary personnel, and their families in an environment that is 100% clean energy-powered and
highly sustainable.  North Sudan will
continuously work to cultivate key Diplomatic and Trade relationships with its
neighbors (Egypt and Sudan) to facilitate the needs of the ARC throughout the
entire Project and into the future post-completion.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Phase 1 – Concept
Development – 1 Year – ($500,000)</b></p>
<p>The
Kingdom of North Sudan seeks this funding to explore the following dynamics of
the North Sudan Scientific Fund Program: Feasibility Study, Risk Management
Plan and Cost Benefit Analysis.  This
will allow for defining the boundaries of concepts to be explored, and develop
an understanding of the initial natural and human resources needed to support
the project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Phase 2 – Planning,
Staffing and Requirement Analysis – 2 Years – ($3,000,000)</b></p>
<p>During
this phase the Kingdom of North Sudan will develop a Project Management Plan
for the execution of the desired goals and objectives outlined in Phase 1.  This phase will determine the intellectual
human capital needed to achieve the goals of the North Sudan Scientific Fund.  This phase will identify and solicit the
world’s best agricultural scientists, renewable energy experts, water
purification specialists, plant nutritionists, social scientists, geologists,
climatologist, urban planners, regional experts and other consultants needed to
create the North Sudan Scientific Fund Committee.</p>
<p>Once
established, the NSSF Committee will formalize the needs and requirements for
the Agricultural Research Center (ARC). 
This phase will establish two interconnected aspects of the ARC:</p>
<p>1.  Agricultural
R&amp;D Requirements:  The parameters
between current agricultural science technology and the requirements associated
with exploration of untested theory and practice will be identified.  This will identify gaps between modern
processes and desired outcomes for subjects such as crop efficiency, plant health,
growing environments, LPLD (Local Production / Local Distribution), Production
FWL (Food Waste and Loss), improvements for small farm stakeholders,
aquaponic/hydroponic nutritional requirements and more.  This process will determine a starting core
selection of crops and processes that are well suited for exploration in the
context of growth in a protected environment, as well as to specify efficient
space allocation and resource utilization.</p>
<p>2.  Social
Requirements:  Key necessities will be
determined to ensure the needs of the family unit are met within the ARC, as
the ARC will in effect be a self-sustaining city center, and must address
family life outside the work environment. 
This stage will include requirements for facilities for education, recreation,
medical services, transportation and more.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Phase 3 – Design – 2
Years – ($2,000,000)</b></p>
<p>The
North Sudan Scientific Fund will work to transform the detailed requirements
into a complete, detailed system design.  The design and construct of the ARC will focus
on the best, most sustainable and efficient methods to deliver the required
functionality needed by scientists to explore advanced methods for crop
production, as well as the necessities for a family living in the ARC.  The design phase will be marketed globally
and will allow design firms to pitch designs that will capture the social and technical
specifications of the ARC.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Phase 4 – Implementation of Preliminary Infrastructure – 3 Years ($50,000,000)</b></p>
<p>This
phase sets the foundation for the construction of the ARC. This phase will establish key elements such
as efficient transport systems from locations in Egypt and Sudan to North
Sudan, the development of water resources within the country, power facilities,
etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Phase 5 – ARC
Construction – 3 Years – ($150,000,000)</b></p>
<p>This
is the final Phase of the project, overlapping with the final year of Phase 4: The construction of the ARC.  Construction will represent approximately 30%
of the long-term design plans for the ARC facility.  Approximately 50% of future construction will
be allocated for expansion of R&amp;D facilities and assets, with the remaining
20% for additional infrastructure such as housing, parks, social venues, etc.</p>
<p>The overall project goal for
5 years is $505.5 million<span>.  This is equal to 10% of the United States
population contributing $15 or only 5% of the population of Europe giving $16
Euros. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Our purpose for starting with crowdfunding is to allow the world to hear your voice. This campaign is a chance to show the leaders of other nations that the citizens of the world are ready to put science to work in solving global environmental issues. Our goal with this crowdfunding campaign
is to become a Top 3 campaign at the level of $20 million, and such success will increase the visibility of the
project and attract larger donors with shared goals. </span></p>

world’s greatest achievements often start with a seemingly crazy idea. A dream
so big it challenges people to reconsider what is possible. During great
advancements such as the first powered flight or landing on the moon, the
average person was merely a bystander. This amazing project allows you to
be directly involved in achieving the world’s next great scientific
milestone -- solving world hunger. 


Our modern world is a
truly amazing place. We can answer calls from our wrist watch, track calories
and have cars that park themselves, yet we still don’t have a viable solution
to solve world hunger and famine.  The
Kingdom of North Sudan, the world’s newest nation, hopes to solve this problem
with your assistance and fiscal sponsorship. In creating a new country, we have
the opportunity to make it something truly extraordinary: a nation fully
dedicated to researching and developing solutions for our current global food
shortages and impending food crisis. 

""Rather than handouts, Africa needs capital investment, entrepreneurial innovation and free trade. Mr. Heaton understands this. The journey that started with a little girl’s dream is still that, but dreams can be seedbeds of massive change. ""— Lawrence J. McQuillan  The Independent Institute

In supporting the North Sudan Scientific Fund, you
will be contributing to the world’s largest scientific effort for finding a
better way to grow and distribute food.  
With your help we’ll be able to put a team together that will help us develop the structure and technology needed to revolutionize the agricultural industry. By having a clean slate, 800 square miles of land, we will work with top notch scientists to build a sustainable and efficient farming system. We’ve developed a 5-year plan so that we can accomplish this goal. Below you will find more details of what it all entails.  
How did this idea start? 
Like most things in life,
this project originated from the most unlikely of places: a six-year old little
girl’s request to her father.  You see, my little girl Emily asked if she
would ever be a real princess one day. Like any father would do, I told her she
could be anything she wanted. Her eyes lit up with joy
as she thought about that unexpected possibility. 


Now most people would have stopped there, but natural curiosity made me
wonder if it might really be possible to make Emily an actual princess. That is when the search to make my little girl’s dream a
reality began. The first step would have to be to find unclaimed,
ungoverned, unpopulated land, and in East Africa I was able to do just that. 





The next step would be to make a flag for this new
country, which we did. 


                                


The last step would be to take that flag and plant it
in this new country, which I did on June 16, 2014, little Emily’s 7th
birthday.  






With this small act of love, the Kingdom of North
Sudan was created and the news quickly traveled around the world, bringing unexpected “fame” to my average and humble family.  But this, we would
soon discover, was just the beginning.
The
“Elon Musk Approach” to Agri-Science
Having created the world’s
newest nation in the heart of the east African desert, the question became, “What do we do with it?”  Emily, having learned
about hungry children in Africa from her elementary school teacher, stated very
clearly, “Grow a garden as big as our country to
feed people!""  

Her simple idea about growing food for people transformed itself into the project you see here today. The revenue generated by this campaign will be used to advance the next great
agricultural revolution. Using the scientific funding methodology pioneered by
Elon Musk (SpaceX and Tesla Motors), we intend
to fully fund the world’s best scientists in a pursuit to identify new, better
ways to grow food using considerably less water, within
a nation whose very existence, laws and regulations will be designed to make it
easier to accomplish such endeavors. All technological advancements will
be provided directly to any other nation, university or corporation, free of charge. 
Such important innovations warrant an open
source mentality, nothing less.
Given that the Kingdom of North Sudan is 800 sq. miles in size, it is a blank slate
ready to be developed into a cutting-edge research center for agricultural technology
and energy efficiency. 




Why should you contribute to this campaign?

Human activity over the last few centuries has not
been very kind to our Earth. The repercussions for our past actions are upon
us; we must now improve our relationship with agriculture and water usage.
Conditions are becoming less than ideal in our breadbasket areas across the
globe as crop production suffers due to an increasing lack of water. Much of
the water, approximately 70%, used in agriculture is wasted
via runoff or evaporation. This is a considerable amount of waste when one
factors in the fact that agriculture consumes
approximately 70% of the world’s accessible fresh water supply.

                                                                                       
*http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/agriculture/impacts/water_use/


We believe that by dedicating an entire nation to
achieving agricultural improvements and building a nation that is 100%
sustainable, we will gain the necessary knowledge and technological advancement
to improve our future here on Earth.  



Is
it a lot to take on? Yes. Is it a huge project? Yes. But
it is the nature of these challenges that motivates us, as it did when we
decided to fly, went to the Moon, sent rovers to Mars and explored the depths
of the ocean.  The world does not lack
the intellectual capacity to better itself. 
What we do seem to lack is a concerted effort within a “user friendly”
environment whereby the best and brightest can come together.  With the
funds from this campaign, we will be able to start collaborating with
top scientists and find new ways of growing food more efficiently, using less water, in a cost-effective manner. To achieve greatness, you have to dream big, and
that is what we are doing. We need your help in making this dream a
reality. 

If you are frustrated with the lack of substantial progress being made to
counteract the impact of climate change on Earth, THIS PROJECT IS FOR YOU! 
If
you are a farmer hoping to find a better way to grow food that doesn’t require genetic modification, THIS PROJECT IS FOR YOU!
If you want to leave this world a better place for your children,
grandchildren and great grandchildren, THIS PROJECT IS FOR YOU! 

If you love
proving people wrong who say something can’t be done, THIS PROJECT IS MOST CERTAINLY FOR YOU!











What are
the next steps and how will the funds be used: 

The North Sudan Scientific
Fund will be used for the development of the Agricultural Research Center;
affectionately called the ARC. The ARC is a modern scientific lifeboat designed
to save lives by unlocking new advances in agriculture: preventing starvation,
hunger and climate related interruptions in the food supply system.  The North Sudan Scientific Fund ARC will
allow the world’s best scientists to conduct meaningful research and
collaborate in a fully-funded laboratory.

Building a country from the
ground up is a huge task, and we are aware that there may be unexpected
obstacles, but we have spent time detailing a plan to define what the first
steps are to achieve this. 



Phase 0 – Project Initiation
and Diplomacy
The
Kingdom of North Sudan has identified the need for advancement in
agricultural  science that combats the
effects of global warming on crop production. 
The Kingdom of North Sudan seeks to develop an Agricultural Research
Center (ARC) designed to house scientists, all necessary complementary personnel, and their families in an environment that is 100% clean energy-powered and
highly sustainable.  North Sudan will
continuously work to cultivate key Diplomatic and Trade relationships with its
neighbors (Egypt and Sudan) to facilitate the needs of the ARC throughout the
entire Project and into the future post-completion.

Phase 1 – Concept
Development – 1 Year – ($500,000)
The
Kingdom of North Sudan seeks this funding to explore the following dynamics of
the North Sudan Scientific Fund Program: Feasibility Study, Risk Management
Plan and Cost Benefit Analysis.  This
will allow for defining the boundaries of concepts to be explored, and develop
an understanding of the initial natural and human resources needed to support
the project.

Phase 2 – Planning,
Staffing and Requirement Analysis – 2 Years – ($3,000,000)
During
this phase the Kingdom of North Sudan will develop a Project Management Plan
for the execution of the desired goals and objectives outlined in Phase 1.  This phase will determine the intellectual
human capital needed to achieve the goals of the North Sudan Scientific Fund.  This phase will identify and solicit the
world’s best agricultural scientists, renewable energy experts, water
purification specialists, plant nutritionists, social scientists, geologists,
climatologist, urban planners, regional experts and other consultants needed to
create the North Sudan Scientific Fund Committee.
Once
established, the NSSF Committee will formalize the needs and requirements for
the Agricultural Research Center (ARC). 
This phase will establish two interconnected aspects of the ARC:
1.  Agricultural
R&D Requirements:  The parameters
between current agricultural science technology and the requirements associated
with exploration of untested theory and practice will be identified.  This will identify gaps between modern
processes and desired outcomes for subjects such as crop efficiency, plant health,
growing environments, LPLD (Local Production / Local Distribution), Production
FWL (Food Waste and Loss), improvements for small farm stakeholders,
aquaponic/hydroponic nutritional requirements and more.  This process will determine a starting core
selection of crops and processes that are well suited for exploration in the
context of growth in a protected environment, as well as to specify efficient
space allocation and resource utilization.
2.  Social
Requirements:  Key necessities will be
determined to ensure the needs of the family unit are met within the ARC, as
the ARC will in effect be a self-sustaining city center, and must address
family life outside the work environment. 
This stage will include requirements for facilities for education, recreation,
medical services, transportation and more.


Phase 3 – Design – 2
Years – ($2,000,000)
The
North Sudan Scientific Fund will work to transform the detailed requirements
into a complete, detailed system design.  The design and construct of the ARC will focus
on the best, most sustainable and efficient methods to deliver the required
functionality needed by scientists to explore advanced methods for crop
production, as well as the necessities for a family living in the ARC.  The design phase will be marketed globally
and will allow design firms to pitch designs that will capture the social and technical
specifications of the ARC.

Phase 4 – Implementation of Preliminary Infrastructure – 3 Years ($50,000,000)
This
phase sets the foundation for the construction of the ARC. This phase will establish key elements such
as efficient transport systems from locations in Egypt and Sudan to North
Sudan, the development of water resources within the country, power facilities,
etc.



Phase 5 – ARC
Construction – 3 Years – ($150,000,000)
This
is the final Phase of the project, overlapping with the final year of Phase 4: The construction of the ARC.  Construction will represent approximately 30%
of the long-term design plans for the ARC facility.  Approximately 50% of future construction will
be allocated for expansion of R&D facilities and assets, with the remaining
20% for additional infrastructure such as housing, parks, social venues, etc.
The overall project goal for
5 years is $505.5 million.  This is equal to 10% of the United States
population contributing $15 or only 5% of the population of Europe giving $16
Euros. 


Our purpose for starting with crowdfunding is to allow the world to hear your voice. This campaign is a chance to show the leaders of other nations that the citizens of the world are ready to put science to work in solving global environmental issues. Our goal with this crowdfunding campaign
is to become a Top 3 campaign at the level of $20 million, and such success will increase the visibility of the
project and attract larger donors with shared goals. 
Perks: 
We’ve worked on getting some great perks together for

<h3>The Golden Dorado<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>Dorado (<i>Salminus <span>brasiliensis</span></i>) is
an iconic and charismatic fish species in neotropical rivers of Brazil,
Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, and northern Argentina. Both sport and commercial
fishers value Dorado for their sustenance, vigor, beauty, and challenge. ­­Dorado
provides economic support for communities in northern Argentina and throughout South
America. Currently the species is facing severe pressure and declining
populations due to overharvest harvest, habitat degradation, and poorly understood ecology, including movement patterns. <br/></p>

<p>Little is known about Dorado movements and
response to disturbance (Agostinho
et al. 2008, Hahn et al 2011). The Salta region of Argentina is
limited in management resources and faces high social and economic stakes under
poor management of this species. A well-managed Dorado fishery could
potentially provide long-term income to the region. We will investigate the impacts of catch-and-release (C&amp;R) by measuring blood physiology and post-release activity patterns. This work will add to the development of best practices for the C&amp;R 
of Dorado, plus provide insights into their movement ecology.<br/></p>
<p>Our objective is to assess the impacts of recreational fishing, local
stakeholder practices, and habitat conditions on Dorado. Catch-and-release impacts (fight time, air exposure, angling
method) will be assessed for correlation with physiological biomarkers (blood
lactate, blood glucose, blood pH). Additionally, after tagging fish with radio
tags and subsequent mobile tracking, we will quantify immediate post-release
behavior along with longer-term habitat selection, movement patterns, and home
ranges. Data obtained from this study will be used to develop proactive conservation
and management strategies for Dorado populations in the region. In addition the
project will build capacity in the region for local guide and stakeholder
involvement in continuing research.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The research being conducted is guided by a team from the University of Massachusetts Amherst Department of Environmental Conservation. <br/></p>
<p>A team of ecologists will be working in the field, on the Rio Juramento to complete of the objectives you've seen listed. <br/></p>
<p>As the first study of its kind the iconic Golden Dorado the findings and work here stands to be key info that ensures the Dorado will be thriving for years to come. <br/></p>

<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What we need and what you'll get in exchange.<br/>
</h3> <p>Conservation fieldwork and research face significant funding challenges, especially in remote and rural regions under significant environmental pressure of risk and loss.</p>
<p>Funds are needed to cover expenses for: research equipment, travel costs, local guides and assistance, housing, fuel, boats, permitting, and vehicles. <br/></p>
<p>We are building partnerships with local and international partners: companies, universities, and organizations to garner sustainable funding. But with the exploratory and unknown nature of this work your start-up funds are what get this project off the ground. <br/></p>
<p>Local guides have been incredibly supportive with their guidance and assistance to develop the research goals and initiatives. <br/></p>
<p>Any funding that exceeds the need of research expenses is being endowed to the Fundacion Rio Juramento,  a non-profit organization devoted to protecting the Rio Juramento and surrounding watersheds that act as habitat for the Golden Dorado.</p>

<p><b>Specific objectives and tasks</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>1) Effects of catch and release on Dorado.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>We will use a rapid assessment approach to quantify
the physical and physiological impacts of catch and release recreational
angling specific to Dorado (<i>importance of
species specific practices see:</i> Cooke and Suski 2005).<span>  We will measure hooking injury, physiological
stress response, reflex impairment, and short-term mortality related to
commonly used capture and handling methods for Dorado in the Salta region.  This type of information does not currently
exist for Dorado. </span>Information obtained though this research will
lead to development of best practices that can be adopted by anglers, guides,
and local management to increase post-release survivorship and provide valuable
resources for managers and anglers in the development of management plans
(Arlinghaus et al. 2007).</p>
<p><i>2) Post-release behavior and movements of Dorado</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
will use <span>radio telemetry to measure the
behavioral response and short-term movement patters of Dorado following
catch-and-release angling.<span>  Gentle and
aggressive handling treatments will be established based on the outcome of the
rapid assessment, and fish from these treatments will be manually tracked
post-release.  Correlative relationships
will be possible between handling treatments and factors such as rates of
movement, habitat selection, and dispersal from site of capture and
release.  </span>Measures of flow
regulation, habitat conditions, riparian area loss, sedimentation, and
irrigation diversion will also be classified and relationships will be noted.
This element of our project will fill information gaps on post-release delayed
mortality, and spatial ecology of Dorado in a region that is coming under
greater pressures for development. </span></p>
<p><i>3) Socio-ecological survey development and deployment </i></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
will conduct <span>surveys of local
stakeholders, including farmers, anglers, guides, and visiting
tourists/fishers to classify conflict and perceptions related to Dorado and the
Rio Juramento.  Closed and
semi-structured interviews along with surveys will be used to identify issues
constraining stewardship and management such as commercial harvest, recreational
fisheries, and land-use. This element of the study will help put the outcomes
of the first two projects into a broader perspective as they relate to
conservation and management options for Dorado in the Salta region.  Addressing the social/fisheries conflicts
will be critical for pro-active anticipatory rather than reactionary
management.</span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks and challenges <br/>
</h3>Rivers, the fish the live in them, and the watersheds that feed in to them are incredibly dynamic systems that have supported communities for millennia. River protection and health is important to everyone that depends on them. Yet society is always facing additional pressure from social inequality and economic needs. We hope that the findings from our work will be key information in environmental decision making around Golden Dorado that is considerate of all challenges facing the communities supported by these fish and the rivers they inhabit. <br/>-- <br/><h3>So what comes out of this work?</h3>- When you fund any project you want to know; what is your money doing? And what greater impact will have?<br/>So lets be clear about what comes out of this work...<br/><br/>1. Greater knowledge of the Dorado and the community it supports which better informs sustainable management and conservation<br/><br/>2. A chance to perform a rapid assessment of a poorly understood fish facing growing angling pressure in an emerging region. Which will provide lessons and guidelines to be applied to other fish facing similar pressures in remote and striking regions around the world in fast growing emerging regions.<br/><br/>3. Research for peer-reviewed scientific publications that will be published and shared with colleagues and the public that can better inform their own management, research, and conservation initiatives of catch-and-release fisheries in similar and varying locales. <br/><br/>4. A presentation will be developed for an international fisheries management symposium on the tools, lessons learned, and objectives achieved in this project. World leaders in recreational angling will be able to learn from, and provide comment on the initiative you supported.  <br/><br/>5. Social media, photo, video, and audio coverage of the efforts will be continuously shared during and after the project. This will be an opportunity to share the stories of local guides and community members with you, the interested and engaged angling community. Blog posts, instagram photos, and videos will be published on angling websites, organization website, and with company partners: Costa Sunglasses, Patagonia Fly Fishing, The Drake, and The Cleanest Line. <br/>--<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other ways you can support?</h3>
<p>While any funds you can provide are appreciated immensely and used wisely, your support is valued just as much. <br/></p>
<p>- Please raise awareness with your family, friends, and community about the value of Dorado fishery and conservation research. </p>
<p>- Communicate with local decision makers about the importance of developing comprehensive and adaptive management action around recreational fisheries</p>

ranges. Data obtained from this study will be used to develop proactive conservation
and management strategies for Dorado populations in the region. In addition the
project will build capacity in the region for local guide and stakeholder
involvement in continuing research.
--
The research being conducted is guided by a team from the University of Massachusetts Amherst Department of Environmental Conservation. 
A team of ecologists will be working in the field, on the Rio Juramento to complete of the objectives you've seen listed. 
As the first study of its kind the iconic Golden Dorado the findings and work here stands to be key info that ensures the Dorado will be thriving for years to come.

  What we need and what you'll get in exchange.
 Conservation fieldwork and research face significant funding challenges, especially in remote and rural regions under significant environmental pressure of risk and loss.
Funds are needed to cover expenses for: research equipment, travel costs, local guides and assistance, housing, fuel, boats, permitting, and vehicles. 
We are building partnerships with local and international partners: companies, universities, and organizations to garner sustainable funding. But with the exploratory and unknown nature of this work your start-up funds are what get this project off the ground. 
Local guides have been incredibly supportive with their guidance and assistance to develop the research goals and initiatives. 
Any funding that exceeds the need of research expenses is being endowed to the Fundacion Rio Juramento,  a non-profit organization devoted to protecting the Rio Juramento and surrounding watersheds that act as habitat for the Golden Dorado.
 
                                      

        
        
  
Specific objectives and tasks

1) Effects of catch and release on Dorado.

We will use a rapid assessment approach to quantify
the physical and physiological impacts of catch and release recreational
angling specific to Dorado (importance of
species specific practices see: Cooke and Suski 2005).  We will measure hooking injury, physiological
stress response, reflex impairment, and short-term mortality related to
commonly used capture and handling methods for Dorado in the Salta region.  This type of information does not currently
exist for Dorado. Information obtained though this research will
lead to development of best practices that can be adopted by anglers, guides,
and local management to increase post-release survivorship and provide valuable
resources for managers and anglers in the development of management plans
(Arlinghaus et al. 2007).
2) Post-release behavior and movements of Dorado

We
will use radio telemetry to measure the
behavioral response and short-term movement patters of Dorado following
catch-and-release angling.  Gentle and
aggressive handling treatments will be established based on the outcome of the
rapid assessment, and fish from these treatments will be manually tracked
post-release.  Correlative relationships
will be possible between handling treatments and factors such as rates of
movement, habitat selection, and dispersal from site of capture and
release.  Measures of flow
regulation, habitat conditions, riparian area loss, sedimentation, and
irrigation diversion will also be classified and relationships will be noted.
This element of our project will fill information gaps on post-release delayed
mortality, and spatial ecology of Dorado in a region that is coming under
greater pressures for development. 
3) Socio-ecological survey development and deployment 

We
will conduct surveys of local
stakeholders, including farmers, anglers, guides, and visiting
tourists/fishers to classify conflict and perceptions related to Dorado and the
Rio Juramento.  Closed and
semi-structured interviews along with surveys will be used to identify issues
constraining stewardship and management such as commercial harvest, recreational
fisheries, and land-use. This element of the study will help put the outcomes
of the first two projects into a broader perspective as they relate to
conservation and management options for Dorado in the Salta region.  Addressing the social/fisheries conflicts
will be critical for pro-active anticipatory rather than reactionary
management.
  Risks and challenges 
Rivers, the fish the live in them, and the watersheds that feed in to them are incredibly dynamic systems that have supported communities for millennia. River protection and health is important to everyone that depends on them. Yet society is always facing additional pressure from social inequality and economic needs. We hope that the findings from our work will be key information in environmental decision making around Golden Dorado that is considerate of all challenges facing the communities supported by these fish and the rivers they inhabit. -- So what comes out of this work?- When you fund any project you want to know; what is your money doing? And what greater impact will have?So lets be clear about what comes out of this work...1. Greater knowledge of the Dorado and the community it supports which better informs sustainable management and conservation2. A chance to perform a rapid assessment of a poorly understood fish facing growing angling pressure in an emerging region. Which will provide lessons and guidelines to be applied to other fish facing similar pressures in remote and striking regions around the world in fast growing emerging regions.3. Research for peer-reviewed scientific publications that will be published and shared with colleagues and the public that can better inform their own management, research, and conservation initiatives of catch-and-release fisheries in similar and varying locales. 4. A presentation will be developed for an international fisheries management symposium on the tools, lessons learned, and objectives achieved in this project. World leaders in recreational angling will be able to learn from, and provide comment on the initiative you supported.  5. Social media, photo, video, and audio coverage of the efforts will be continuously shared during and after the project. This will be an opportunity to share the stories of local guides and community members with you, the interested and engaged angling community. Blog posts, instagram photos, and videos will be published on angling websites, organization website, and with company partners: Costa Sunglasses, Patagonia Fly Fishing, The Drake, and The Cleanest Line. --
  Other ways you can support?
While any funds you can provide are appreciated immensely and used wisely, your support is valued just as much. 
- Please raise awareness with your family, friends, and community about the value of Dorado fishery and conservation research. 
- Communicate with local decision makers about the importance of developing comprehensive and adaptive management action around recreational fisheries
- Share your photos, videos, and other media about your responsible and conservation minded recreational fishing.

¿Quienes somos?

Creando Redes somos Sandra, Ana, Adrián y Alberto, un grupo de científicos emprendedores que hemos trabajamos en la difusión y el fomento de la aplicación de la Restauración Ecológica.

Equipo de Creando Redes

La Restauración Ecológica recupera los ecosistemas que han sido degradados o destruidos por las actividades humanas  o eventos naturales extremos, aplicando el conocimiento científico y que tiene como objetivo regenerar paisajes y servicios ecosistémicos tales como la depuración de agua, el almacén de carbono, la fertilidad del suelo o la biodiversidad.
La Restauración ecológica integra a la sociedad como una parte fundamental del proceso: incorpora la visión de todos los individuos en el diseño de las soluciones para los espacios que se desean restaurar, implica a la población local en el desarrollo de proyectos y orienta los beneficios a las comunidades locales, desarrollando la economía y la cohesión social de la zona.
¿Qué hacemos?
El propósito es simple: queremos hacer llegar la Restauraión Ecológica a la sociedad, y aportar nuevos criterios y herramientas para la toma de decisiones en materia de medioambiente.

En Creando Redes somos conscientes de que la
educación es el arma más eficiente para favorecer el desarrollo de las
sociedades y promover modelos más sostenibles, que permitan compatibilizar
nuestros modos de vida con el mantenimiento de los recursos naturales. 
Por ello organizamos cursos de Restauración Ecológica en modo presencial y online y creamos entornos de  participación e intercambio de experiencias

Who we are
Sandra, Ana, Adrian and Alberto are the Co-Founders of Creando Redes, a group of entrepreneur scientist working on
the dissemination, promotion and implementation of Ecological
Restoration.




Creando Redes team
Ecological Restoration assists the recovery of
ecosystems that have been degraded, destroyed or transformed by human activities or natural events. Applying this
scientific knowledge, we can regenerate landscapes and ecosystem services such
as water purification, soil carbon sequestration, soil fertility or
biodiversity.
Ecological restoration integrates society as a fundamental part of
the recovery process.  Ecological Restoration involves local
people in the development of the project and delivers direct
benefits for local communities such as better environmental
conditions, new economic resources and social
engagement with the territory.
What we do?
We want to bring Ecological Restoration to society, and provide new approaches and tools for decision
making in environmental aspects.
We are aware that education is the most
efficient tool to enhance the development of societies and to promote more
sustainable models which allow us to combine our lifestyles with the
maintenance of natural resources.
With this in mind, we organize Ecological Restoration training courses, and we create participation and experience
exchange fora, as the Foro de Restauración Ecológica: Creando Redes. 




Our activity areas
How we do it
Generating a global change is only possible through networking.
Thus, in Creando Redes, we
collaborate with the most reputed experts in ecological restoration in the
world, who participate in the elaboration of our courses and in our fora
offering their knowledge and experience.

International network
of partners
What we need
Changing the
world through face-to-face communication is not easy. Therefore, to spread the knowledge of ecological
restoration all over the world we need a web platform where our courses can be uploaded and disseminated. We
are also going to launch our first
online course on Ecological Restoration!! 
To this end,
we need 12.400 €, that will be spent on:
Online
Platform

Design of web platform
     and domains 

Total: 3.600

Neil Rolnick</b><br/></p>
<p>What can I
say about something as concrete and complex as climate change? This is the
question I started with when I sat down to compose <b><i>Oceans Eat Cities</i></b>. My
first step in finding an answer was to approach Dr Benjamin Strauss at <b>Climate Central</b> to see if his research
group might be able to help me understand something about the topic that might
lend itself to a musical manifestation.</p>
<p>Ben gave me
a series of data spreadsheets that projected the impact of rising sea level on
cities worldwide, both in terms of numbers of people living on threatened land and
the percentages of total city populations that they represent.  There were different projections for each
coastal city, based on our effectiveness at limiting carbon emissions.  The various greenhouse gas concentration
trajectories are expressed in terms of Representative Concentration Pathways
(RCP).  On this scale, RCP 8.5 represents
a scenario in which we just keep doing what we are doing now.  That is, we don’t do very much to limit
pollution.  In this case, we lock in
dramatically higher sea levels between now and the year 2100 with a trajectory
that increases into the future.  An RCP
2.6 scenario represents the result of maximum aggressive efforts to control
greenhouse gas emissions, starting now and continuing into the future.  In this scenario, there’s a certain amount of
“locked in” damage, but by the middle of the 21st Century, things level out and
we stop locking in additional sea level rise. 
There is still some damage but it is limited.</p>
<p>Since what I
wanted to represent was the relative way that the heart of a city would be
displaced by rising seas I took a musical theme and repeated it, while
subtracting the percentage of notes that was the equivalent to the percentage
of the population of the city on land that would be affected by sea level rise.
 The first movement uses data from the
RCP 8.5 scenario from Shanghai (China), Mumbai (India), Bangkok (Thailand) and
Osaka (Japan).  The second movement uses
data from the RCP 2.6 scenario from Sidarjo (Malaysia), Tianjin (China) and
Miami (USA). </p>

What would happen if a multitude of voices, voices like yours, started to demand a greener tomorrow? Sure, the popular voice is pro-environment. But are corporate leaders and policy makers really paying attention or doing enough? There is a ton you can do in your daily life and community. But we need change on a global level. We need a multitude of voices rising together to be heard. We need all of our individual opinions and goals to be joined together to create a real force. We need you. Join the movement to make this app a reality. Every euro counts.

Altogether GREEN!


Why we want your help?
GreenAdvisor is seeking funds and support to contribute to the development and the testing of the platform. With each additional $3,000 we will be able to pilot the platform in additional cities. Presently the team is investigating the following 5 cities for the testing phase: New York, San Francisco, London, Berlin or Budapest. 






With GreenAdvisor, users will be able to:

Find and patronize businesses and organizations which act in an environmentally responsible way.
Instantly locate any business or organization that has already been rated, either good or bad.
Rate the green performance of businesses and organizations to pressure and incentivize them to act greener.
Hold businesses and organizations accountable if they fail to live up to their green potential.




By mobilizing large numbers of people to “vote with their feet and wallets”, GreenAdvisor will reshape the way consumers can influence businesses to act greener. GreenAdvisor seeks to democratize the green movement in much the same way that TripAdvisor has democratized the travel industry. Hence the name.
GreenAdvisor will position consumers to rate businesses according to the following types of indicators:

<br/><p>Help Austin Honey
Company fully recover from recent flooding events at Bernhardt Farm in Elgin, TX, as well as, unexplained large winter losses the last several months on all of our bee farm locations.
 </p>
<p>We have lost a total of 28 beehives during three separate flood events
during 2015 in May, June, and October.  Additionally, our apiaries have been decimated over this winter by an unknown calamity--we suspect colony collapse disorder.  We have lost an additional 33 hives over the winter--an unsustainable loss.  This is a total of 61 hives lost.  As a small artisan company,
this is a combined devastating loss since May of 2015.  We need to rebuild our apiaries and purchase
high-quality and gentle nucleus colonies of bees now for 2016.   </p>
<p>You can help
us by adopting a beehive, thus providing a direct economic contribution to our
operation now.  This direct contribution will go to purchasing new colonies
of bees now and helping us offset the high costs of getting bees built up to
pollinate crops.  Our bees reside on
local organic farms that are doing an outstanding job of producing wholesome
food for our local community in the Austin, TX area, as well as, contributing
to greater ecological diversity and a healthier environment.  </p>

<p><strong>The Race to Save the World</strong> is a feature documentary film that follows the inspiring stories of everyday people who are devoting their lives to fighting climate change.  This film follows the passion, determination and unwavering commitment of people who aren't putting their heads in the sand, they aren't waiting for someone else to do something, they’re in the trenches doing anything and everything they can to make an impact. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479508989/qhoq0knwjvoz5tzq3z9o.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The news about climate change is overwhelming and frightening and many think that there is little that one person can do, so they tune out this message. The Race To Save The World will motivate rather than frighten viewers, as we show people who are doing all they can to inspire the world to act while there’s still time to lessen the damage on future generations.</p>
<p>We were nearly done shooting and already editing The Race To Save The World when the election happened.  With all the climate deniers and the fossil fuel extractors in this administration, we were so shocked and saddened that we decided we needed to film for another 4-6 months into the new administration to show how people will continue to fight to protect life on this planet. </p>
<p>In order to finish principal photography, we need to raise $40,000.  If we raise more, we will put it towards the editing, as well as the sound mix and the music.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479515483/p4qhy1es3cggja5c71ii.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>THE NEXT SIX MONTHS ARE KEY!</strong></p>
<p>We have been filming for over two years, and it’s clear that there is a powerful movement building. While millions of people are still tuning out climate change and going about their lives hoping that someone else will solve this crisis, there are more and more people who are deeply engaged in the fight to preserve our planet for future generations.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The Race to Save the World follows our subjects from a very personal perspective.  By humanizing our subjects and revealing personal story arcs, viewers are drawn into the issue of global warming from a place of inspiration, rather than fear, and their stories will inspire audiences to join this fight.  Our goal in making The Race To Save The World is to help bring a new population of people into this movement, to make their voices heard and to take action for a livable future.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482198682/hb7wh3ugfm3v8qyhisgg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why We're Fighting</strong></p>
<p>Public policy changes when enough Americans voice their desires to see change, and it moves faster when the populace speaks loudly and forcefully to make sure that politicians pay attention. As Mark Hertsgaard, environmental correspondent for The Nation points out in our film, “The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, why did they happen? They happened because 20 million Americans got into the street. And that is what it's going to take.” By showing the stories of these unstoppable, tireless and resolute partisans in the fight for our collective future, we hope to shift the focus away from fear, and towards an uplifting spirit of unity and collective action.</p>
<p><strong>Where Will Your Money Go?</strong></p>
<p>All funds from this Indiegogo campaign will be allocated to cover essential production-related expenses. This money will come at a critical time as we are finishing up the filming.  Funds will be used to cover crew costs, travel and logistics and will ensure that we don't miss important moments needed to finalize the story arcs of our subjects.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482198709/kceji7ckjgycxtmirxxw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What if we raise more than our goal?</strong></p>
<p>If we reach $90,000 we will be able to finish the filming AND the offline editing.  And if we receive $150,000, we will be able to do the color correction, sound mix and music and completely finish the film!!  If we can rally support and raise all of these funds now, it will ensure that The Race To Save The World will be finished by the end of 2017, so that we can use this film to get people to join this war against catastrophic climate change before it’s too late.</p>

<p>Joe Gantz is known for work that examines personal stories with honesty, humor, and depth. With his brother, Joe produced and directed Taxicab Confessions, the Emmy award-winning HBO documentary series featuring real-life interactions between cab drivers and their passengers that has been broadcast for fifteen years. Through their work, they’ve honed a documentary style they call, “life in progress” that allows them to make their subjects so comfortable that they quickly go about their daily life, as if there was no one filming. The subjects are not performing; they are guiding this story, and the camera transports you into their lives, making for very authentic stories.  </p>

<p><strong>Our Last Film</strong></p>
<p>Through the making of our last documentary, <i>American Winter</i>, we saw how a film can contribute significantly to a much bigger movement.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479766553/pa1yb8mteg87dvx4farc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>American Winter is about families struggling in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The film follows personal stories that reveal the impact of rising poverty and income inequality and a shrinking middle class in the U.S., and was nominated for an Emmy Award and a Ridenhour Prize (a prize for acts of truth-telling that protect the public interest). Since American Winter was broadcast on HBO, we had successful screenings with non-profit partners in over 100 cities to bring attention to the issues of poverty, homelessness, food insecurity and the need for social services.  And we are very proud that this film had a significant part in the movement to raise the minimum wage.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>American Winter Trailer</strong></p>

</div></div>","The Race to Save the World is a feature documentary film that follows the inspiring stories of everyday people who are devoting their lives to fighting climate change.  This film follows the passion, determination and unwavering commitment of people who aren't putting their heads in the sand, they aren't waiting for someone else to do something, they’re in the trenches doing anything and everything they can to make an impact. 

The news about climate change is overwhelming and frightening and many think that there is little that one person can do, so they tune out this message. The Race To Save The World will motivate rather than frighten viewers, as we show people who are doing all they can to inspire the world to act while there’s still time to lessen the damage on future generations.
We were nearly done shooting and already editing The Race To Save The World when the election happened.  With all the climate deniers and the fossil fuel extractors in this administration, we were so shocked and saddened that we decided we needed to film for another 4-6 months into the new administration to show how people will continue to fight to protect life on this planet. 
In order to finish principal photography, we need to raise $40,000.  If we raise more, we will put it towards the editing, as well as the sound mix and the music.

THE NEXT SIX MONTHS ARE KEY!
We have been filming for over two years, and it’s clear that there is a powerful movement building. While millions of people are still tuning out climate change and going about their lives hoping that someone else will solve this crisis, there are more and more people who are deeply engaged in the fight to preserve our planet for future generations.

The Race to Save the World follows our subjects from a very personal perspective.  By humanizing our subjects and revealing personal story arcs, viewers are drawn into the issue of global warming from a place of inspiration, rather than fear, and their stories will inspire audiences to join this fight.  Our goal in making The Race To Save The World is to help bring a new population of people into this movement, to make their voices heard and to take action for a livable future.

Why We're Fighting
Public policy changes when enough Americans voice their desires to see change, and it moves faster when the populace speaks loudly and forcefully to make sure that politicians pay attention. As Mark Hertsgaard, environmental correspondent for The Nation points out in our film, “The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, why did they happen? They happened because 20 million Americans got into the street. And that is what it's going to take.” By showing the stories of these unstoppable, tireless and resolute partisans in the fight for our collective future, we hope to shift the focus away from fear, and towards an uplifting spirit of unity and collective action.
Where Will Your Money Go?
All funds from this Indiegogo campaign will be allocated to cover essential production-related expenses. This money will come at a critical time as we are finishing up the filming.  Funds will be used to cover crew costs, travel and logistics and will ensure that we don't miss important moments needed to finalize the story arcs of our subjects.

What if we raise more than our goal?
If we reach $90,000 we will be able to finish the filming AND the offline editing.  And if we receive $150,000, we will be able to do the color correction, sound mix and music and completely finish the film!!  If we can rally support and raise all of these funds now, it will ensure that The Race To Save The World will be finished by the end of 2017, so that we can use this film to get people to join this war against catastrophic climate change before it’s too late.
Why us?
Joe Gantz is known for work that examines personal stories with honesty, humor, and depth. With his brother, Joe produced and directed Taxicab Confessions, the Emmy award-winning HBO documentary series featuring real-life interactions between cab drivers and their passengers that has been broadcast for fifteen years. Through their work, they’ve honed a documentary style they call, “life in progress” that allows them to make their subjects so comfortable that they quickly go about their daily life, as if there was no one filming. The subjects are not performing; they are guiding this story, and the camera transports you into their lives, making for very authentic stories.  

Producer/Director Joe Gantz
Our Last Film
Through the making of our last documentary, American Winter, we saw how a film can contribute significantly to a much bigger movement.

American Winter is about families struggling in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The film follows personal stories that reveal the impact of rising poverty and income inequality and a shrinking middle class in the U.S., and was nominated for an Emmy Award and a Ridenhour Prize (a prize for acts of truth-telling that protect the public interest). Since American Winter was broadcast on HBO, we had successful screenings with non-profit partners in over 100 cities to bring attention to the issues of poverty, homelessness, food insecurity and the need for social services.  And we are very proud that this film had a significant part in the movement to raise the minimum wage.
American Winter Trailer

Four subjects from American Winter were invited to testify at a Senate hearing entitled, “The State of the American Dream – Economic Policy and the Future of the Middle Class”, moderated by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley.  For The Race to Save the World, we will use a similar personal approach to emotionally-engage viewers in this urgent fight against catastrophic climate change.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help and contribution to create educational videos (e.g., 30 minutes) about pollution, deforestation, recycling, conservation and animal rights.</p>
<p>Kids can learn to make this planet a cleaner, safer and friendlier place to live.</p>
<p>We need to fund $15,000.00 USD</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us to pay for production costs that involves filming, editing, etc.</p>
<p>It also includes paying for a director, script writer, actors and extras, a voice over personality, studio locations, music (licenses) and permits.</p>
<p>If the incoming funds exceeds our goal, we would include animated sequences in the educational video(s) of Globearth in either 2D or 3D.</p>
<p>We are planning to film one episode on the beach (Santa Monica or Laguna Beach), two episodes in a production studio and the last episode with live animals at Planet Rehab. These specified locations require permits and licenses to film. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As studies have shown, children are willing to explore and learn more when a program has an animated or a cartoon character leading the educational message or discussion. Globearth has the ability to have a huge impact on children that will help lead them into debates and discussions about the different environmental topics. Globearth's presence and live interaction in the educational videos will help children remember the important environmental issues for years to come!</p>
<p><i>What is or was your favorite animated or mascot character(s) when growing up?</i> </p>
<p><i>Did that character(s) present a message that taught you valuable lessons in life?</i></p>
<p><i>Do you remember how influential that character was to you when you were growing up?</i></p>
<p><strong>Please support this campaign and let's make Globearth part of the new generation! Your contribution is very valuable for this project!  Together we can make a difference!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Let me share a story;</strong></p>
<p>One sunny Saturday, March of 2015, Globearth (mascot costume) made its first appearance at the Santa Monica Pier in California. It was one the most beautiful experiences I have ever witnessed in my life! The general public was welcoming and excited to meet Globearth<i>,</i> families interacted and took pictures all day. The connection between Globearth<i> </i>and the children was so unreal that it encouraged me to dedicate myself to this new passion project. </p>
<p><span>Since then, Globearth</span><i> </i>has appeared and participated voluntarily in different cities and events: Earth Day CVWD in Rancho Cucamonga; All Kids Expo in Rancho Cucamonga; Founders Day Community Parade in Rancho Cucamonga; Planet Rehab's Beach Clean Up Day at Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach; Earth and Environmental Day in Claremont, Diamond Bar, Chino, San Dimas; and the Central American Parade in Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>Research Philosophy </strong></p>
<p>My research corresponds with theories asserting that individuals and human collectives find healing and wholeness by owning multiple versions of difficult and complex histories and dreaming into being new realities for futures.

The complexity of my own identity informs my desire to research the complexity of collective identities. Because I have researched and own the complexity within myself, I can research complexity outside of myself effectively.</p>
<p>My research is imbued with a science and a politics of hope, with a theory of compassion. It centers healing, consciousness, and liberation/salvation. I choose to focus my work on healing, consciousness, and liberation not to ignore problems, but because doing so allows the problem to emerge as part of the discussion without it being the whole discussion. Authentic discussions of healing require mentioning from what and through what one is being healed. Authentic discussions of liberation require mentioning from what one is being liberated. Narratives of healing and liberation inspire, encourage, and empower.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>About Us: </strong>Launched in 2015, the key purpose of the International Resilience Network (IRN) is supporting the growth of locally based innovations aimed at healing our inter-generational and inter-species connections. At the Heart of our work is the resurgence of Indigenous knowledge for human and planetary well-being, Elders and  youth have important roles to play at our helm.</p>
<p>Those who have either founded or are friends of IRN are passionate about the revitalization of Indigenous and interconnected ways of being as a response to the individualism and consumerism that is wiping away life.</p>
<p>Relationships play an important part in our community-building and there's a lot of growing enthusiasm on the ground about our hubs!  Our 7 communities include people who attended our 2015 Summit- they are already part of our network. Some of us have been working and growing together for over a decade or more - for example the Radical Human Ecology and Dialogues across Canada; KIN, and theSpirit Matters community.</p>
<p><i><strong>Our Team:</strong></i> We have a small team of directors.</p>

<p><strong>About Our Campaign: </strong>Our campaign to heal inter-generational and inter-species connections is in response to the profound <strong><i>Disconnect Condition</i></strong> of our times. For example, this is evident in the interconnected problems of climate-change and species depletion, Indigenous youth suicide or the high poverty rates of older people. If our inter-generational and inter-species connections continue to unravel so do we!</p>
<p>As a means of strengthening our connections and passing on traditional knowledge we are continuing to re-establish the rich Indigenous, inter-generational, and  intercultural connections begun at our 2015 Summit on Tsawout traditional territory. To do this we aim to establish<strong> 7 inter-generational resilience hubs </strong>in Canada, Scotland, Aotearoa and Australia.</p>
<p>The <strong>aim</strong> of each hub is to strengthen practices of intergenerational resilience - the strength that comes from shared knowledge and connections between Elders and youth.  Whether through land-based learning, arts informed ways of being or deep fireside talks, each hub will bring Elders and youth together for inter-generational learning around practical tasks of sustainability. Each hub or sustainability innovation will be evaluated and learnings shared through our global virtual exchange program.</p>
<p><strong>Your contributions </strong>will be vital in enabling Elders and young people to attend each hub, supporting the costs of food, venue, learning materials, coordination and program evaluation. Through connecting and supporting today's knowledge keepers and tomorrow's leaders your contributions play a vital role in ensuring we sustain the web of life! Just like a well-tended garden, if given the support and nourishment, each hub will seed new hubs, spinning the web of resilience wide and far.</p>

These giants included the Yangtze river dolphin, the Steller’s sea cow and the Tasmanian tiger. All wiped out through greed, ignorance and apathy.

Throw in a pinch of climate change and a dash of ocean acidification and its a pretty grim stew.

The lough has also lost another vital component of its ecosystem, the </span>mussel<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> reefs, which supported </span>squillions<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of biodiversity (again, they didn't exactly walk out of the reef). In short, the Lough has become degraded, missing vital members from both the top (skate) and bottom (mussels) parts of its ecosystem. In the absence of higher predators, the </span>recovery<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of the reef is being suppressed by crabs (who without skates and rays are in seventh heaven).

This is a paradigm shifter. </span></font></p><p><u><strong>Where you can help</strong></u></p><p>All donations will go directly towards supporting research by postgraduate students that is all directly relevant to the foundation and realisation of SkatePark. Mostly, we require funding to pay for boat time to support research projects.

Please check out Alexandra's video to find out what she will spend your hard earned dough on.</p><p><u><strong>Who We Are </strong></u><br/>Our research team is led by Dr Patrick Collins at Queen’s University in Belfast in Northern Ireland and Alexandra McInturf at University of California, Davis in the good ol' US of A.

Our project will carry out vital research on the basic ecology, physiology and behaviour of these species as well as test the efficacy of translocation (think Star Trek and the Whales, then tone it down as we will be flying their eggs over and hatching them).The problemUnfortunately, the cards are stacked against us – in the current political climate conservation funding is at a low ebb and the political will to be creative and make a positive difference is completely lacking. Throw in a pinch of climate change and a dash of ocean acidification and its a pretty grim stew. But SkatePark is a battle we can win, Skatepark is realistic, feasible and with your donations we will do it!The SolutionWe are proposing a damper Yellowstone Wolf project: using the Strangford Lough Marine Protected Area in Northern Ireland as a test site for SkatePark, the world first elasmobranch reserve. The Lough was once home to plenty of skate and other smaller cousins, but they disappeared (they didn't go on holiday, if you know what I mean). The lough has also lost another vital component of its ecosystem, the mussel reefs, which supported squillions of biodiversity (again, they didn't exactly walk out of the reef). In short, the Lough has become degraded, missing vital members from both the top (skate) and bottom (mussels) parts of its ecosystem. In the absence of higher predators, the recovery of the reef is being suppressed by crabs (who without skates and rays are in seventh heaven). We believe that a recovery in the predator population will suppress crab foraging enough too allow the mussel reef (and the associated biodiversity) to recover. Luckily, the Lough and the Skate now  enjoy robust legal protection. The site is practically enclosed and we have local support, this can work!SkatePark is a demonstration project, if we can demonstrate the efficacy of transloacting apex predators here, we can use this to help justify similar active conservation actions elsewhere. This is a paradigm shifter. Where you can helpAll donations will go directly towards supporting research by postgraduate students that is all directly relevant to the foundation and realisation of SkatePark. Mostly, we require funding to pay for boat time to support research projects. We have students, basic equipment but no boat support, which is a bit important for carrying out most marine biological projects. Please check out Alexandra's video to find out what she will spend your hard earned dough on.Who We Are Our research team is led by Dr Patrick Collins at Queen’s University in Belfast in Northern Ireland and Alexandra McInturf at University of California, Davis in the good ol' US of A. The video footage was taken by our buddies at Puffin Media (subsea footage) and by N&L productions (above sea footage). You might think it odd that some Californians are supporting a project based in the North East Atlantic, but maybe they believe this can work too!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>The Climate Change and Extreme Weather Story</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who?</strong></h2>
<p>We are Michal, Vlado, Danka, Anton and Peter and we are part of the team working on this crowdfunding campaign. But Rain for Climate is actually much more – we are a <strong>consortium of renowned scientist and experts from 13 countries</strong>, backed up by academic and privately held institutions and we keep growing. We have been <strong>researching climate change</strong> and hydrology from various perspectives <strong>since 1980’s</strong>, came to a dramatic conclusion <strong>and have</strong> <strong>very important massage</strong> for humanity to deliver.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>What?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Climate Change, Extreme Weather and Water</strong></h3>
<p>Our research shows that the presence of <strong>water</strong> in a territory is absolutely <strong>essential for thermoregulation</strong> to function on planet Earth. Mismanagement of rainwater is gradually leading to permanent water scarcity on continents with devastating consequences.</p>
<p>People annually seal vast areas by development activities and further boost the negative impact of such actions by industrialized agriculture, managed forestry and deforestation. This spins off a growing spiral of destruction: lack of water causes individual territories to overheat and soil to lose its ability to absorb water – the temperatures hit extremes, since there is not enough water to act as a thermoregulation medium - the <strong>‘heat island’ effect deforms local weather</strong> conditions causing turbulent events and shifts in precipitation patterns – this results in droughts or extreme rainfall from dense clouds – the floods and erosion take away soil, and we channel it to the seas – and the loop closes, only more extensively.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541405395/xpjqxjhao4xjqx6fv0a3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Pic.: heat island effect deforming local weather</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Desertification</strong></h3>
<p>Temperature and precipitation extremes, lack of soil and flashfloods – these are characteristics of deserts. To make things worse, we put ourselves into the boiling frog’s situation - people are causing the <strong>biggest desertification ever</strong>, causing the complete destabilization of Earth’s thermoregulation <strong>without realizing</strong> it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541406070/mnsligb5vfsomqwd8g1q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Pic.: temperature extremes caused by lack of water on territory</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
<p>Our research indicates that to stabilize the climate globally, we will <strong>need to return approx. 700 km<sup>3</sup> (168 mi<sup>3</sup>) of water back to continents</strong>. To put it into perspective, let’s take Mt. Everest as the highest mountain on Earth. The goal is 35x the volume of Mt. Everest.</p>
<p>How does one return water to a territory? The <strong>answer is</strong> called <strong>rainwater retention measures</strong>. You can think of it as construction work and by specific remodeling of your property you can achieve zero rainwater runoff. Correctly using the retained water will minimize the negative impact on the local climate.</p>
<p>It is easier said than done because the property owner usually wants to keep the function of the property in its current form (e.g., factory, golf course, agricultural land, etc.)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542151177/o5jwhavrywdpyo0oxzpe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Pic.: solution samples in urban environment, argicultural land and forest</p> <h2><strong>How?</strong></h2>
<p>The good news is that to <strong>work with water is very actionable</strong>, unlike CO2 reduction. It is mainly a matter of being consciously aware of what is required and understanding several basic concepts.</p>
<p>You can <strong>implement </strong>rainwater retention measures on a small property <strong>yourself</strong>. It is part of our mission to empower people <strong>with proper knowledge</strong>. Please refer to the <a href=""https://www.rainforclimate.com/articles/DIY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DIY section</a> of our website for more details.</p>
<p>It does get more complicated when one is working on a complex property or is addressing a climate change specific issue. For example, a flood prevention measure must be well designed to save lives and avert damage; equally drought prevention need to be designed systematically taking local conditions into account to work at all.</p>
<p>We have designed a <strong>specific technology</strong> – collecting data by a customized drone, we <strong>can measure and</strong> assess the impact of the territory on local climate and we can <strong>custom design </strong>specific <strong>rainwater measures</strong> virtually anywhere in the world. The prototypes are work-in-progress but to achieve the big goal; we need<strong> </strong>to <strong>scale up</strong>.</p>
<p>The other aspect is <strong>crowdsourcing</strong>  - it takes <strong>a</strong> <strong>territory, human power, capital</strong> and <strong>know-how </strong>to materialize a rainwater retention project. This is why we want to provide basic how-to to everybody and turn our website <strong>into a global rehydration portal</strong>, where people based on their geography, offer their resources and projects that are accessible to everyone for rapid knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>Having previous experience with politics and to make the movement sustainable for the long-term, we decided to drive this <strong>movement from bottom up</strong>. Our mission is to share the knowledge and work with people making our way <strong>towards the policymakers</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Other Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>A rainwater retention program, when approached systematically and designed carefully, yields besides local climate moderation, other very interesting benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Flood, water erosion and mudslides prevention</strong> – we slow down, retain and use rainwater before it can cause damage.

<li>Increase in biomass and <strong>food production</strong> – thriving ecosystems produce more biomass and ultimately more food than before.</li>
<li>
<strong>Carbon sequestration</strong> – increased biomass production effectively sequestrates carbon from the air in the most traditional, yet most natural fashion, no geoengineering required.</li>
<li>
<strong>Job creation and local economies support</strong> – local companies implementing rainwater retention measures mean we create local jobs. In combination with secured food it helps to achieve local political stabilization - once again we <a href=""https://rainforclimate.com/science-behind#proof_of_concept_locations"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">have achieved it in Slovakia</a>.</li>
<li>When applied systematically, it is possible to <strong>return regular precipitation</strong> patterns even to arid and long-term drought stricken areas.</li>
<li>
<strong>Impact on sea level rise</strong> – did you know that all the rainwater we channel from continents to the oceans and which never comes back due to the heat island phenomena is responsible for sea level rise by 2.1 mm (0.08 in) annually ? Once we retain rainwater on the continents, we leave it up to you to formulate the conclusion.<br/> </li>

<b>Short Summary</b><p></p>
<p>Hi! My name is Peter Danforth. I am the Director of Operations for
Project SERV Inc. a 501(c)(3) not -for-profit organization dedicated the
restoration of shellfish in our marine environments. I have always had a keen
interest in saving our environment through restoration efforts and I started
working on technologies that could do so with shellfish about 5 years ago. My
partners and I have have developed methods to restore shellfish to their marine
environments through a patent pending procedure referred to as Shellfish Set Trap Systems <b>SSTS</b>.</p>
<p>Through our
fundraising efforts we hope to restore shellfish and marine organisms and
their natural habitats, provide education and public outreach, provide jobs and
promote economic development. </p>
<p>Our current specific
fundraising objective is to support the development of our Shellfish Set Trap
System (SSTS). The <b>SSTS</b> is an invention designed to restore oyster reefs
worldwide.</p>
<p><b>The Benefits of the
SSTS</b></p>
<p><b>•<u>Carbon
Sequestration</u>– Buffer acidification of ocean rates through increased
Calcium carbonate levels.</b></p>
<p><b>•<u>Habitat
Restoration</u> - More shellfish means more biodiversity through living
reef systems leading to…</b></p>
<p><b>•<u>Cleaner Waters </u>–
A single oyster alone can filter about 50 gallons of water a day.</b></p>
<p><b>•<u>Increased
Shellfish Landings</u></b></p>

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Impact</b><br/></p>
<p>Your contribution is
an investment in the future of our oceans and a the survival of shellfish like
oysters whose habitats have been decimated by disease, over fishing, and
pollution.  </p>
<p>Coastal wetland loss
is a major environmental problem affecting coastlines worldwide.  The
causes are complex, ranging from global warming, to working coasts supporting critical
infrastructure such as highways, ports, pipelines and navigational waterways of
economic significance. <b>Without coastal restoration, people and businesses will
be forced to retreat from coastal areas which results in severe economic
consequences to various areas.</b></p>
<p>Coastal erosion refers
to land receding along the coastline due to erosion of soil. As humans we have
built habitations along the coastline, flooding of these areas present a
serious danger to human safety and to property. Coastal erosion results from
storms, such as hurricanes, and human activities, such as building on the
wetlands and destroying this ecosystem. Global warming has led to rising sea levels,
which results in disappearing shorelines</p>
<p>The founders of
Project SERV have created a method by which
shellfish larvae are grown in large numbers and released in a natural setting,
beginning earlier in the season than is typically done. This can take the form
of enclosed reef structures; i.e. oyster reefs or clam and scallop swarms where
suitable substrate exists. <b>This system mimics and boosts natural systems.</b></p>
<p>The spawning of
shellfish has occurred for 4000 plus years and the methods have not varied much
until now. </p>
<p><b>Our patented
technology produces more shellfish numbers at twice the rate then
current methods and  and focuses on the bio-remediation of reefs and
ecosystem restoration as opposed to hatchery food production.</b></p>
<p>Shellfish have
supported civilizations for millenniums from Romans to railroad workers in
California in the 1800s. It is theorized that oyster and tuber diet lead to the
survival of the human race some 193,000 years ago during along glacial stage known
as Marine Isotope Stage 6 (MIS6) where only a few thousand breeding individuals
still existed in South Africa. This and the fact that <b>shellfish shells

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi! My name is Peter Danforth. I am the Director of Operations for
Project SERV Inc. a 501(c)(3) not -for-profit organization dedicated the
restoration of shellfish in our marine environments. I have always had a keen
interest in saving our environment through restoration efforts and I started
working on technologies that could do so with shellfish about 5 years ago. My
partners and I have have developed methods to restore shellfish to their marine
environments through a patent pending procedure referred to as Shellfish Set Trap Systems SSTS.
Through our
fundraising efforts we hope to restore shellfish and marine organisms and
their natural habitats, provide education and public outreach, provide jobs and
promote economic development. 
Our current specific
fundraising objective is to support the development of our Shellfish Set Trap
System (SSTS). The SSTS is an invention designed to restore oyster reefs
worldwide.
The Benefits of the
SSTS
•Carbon
Sequestration– Buffer acidification of ocean rates through increased
Calcium carbonate levels.
•Habitat
Restoration - More shellfish means more biodiversity through living
reef systems leading to…
•Cleaner Waters –
A single oyster alone can filter about 50 gallons of water a day.
•Increased
Shellfish Landings




•Coastal Erosion
Mitigation – Oyster Reefs are now part of New York States 2100
Commission Report effort to prevent storm surge damage from storms like
Superstorm Sandy!
•Home Ownership
Values– Clean waters, protected shorelines adds value to home owners with
shore front property.
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal for April
2016 is to raise $250,000
$250,000 is the
minimum budget to effectively run Project SERV Inc. and its current projects.

The Impact
Your contribution is
an investment in the future of our oceans and a the survival of shellfish like
oysters whose habitats have been decimated by disease, over fishing, and
pollution.  
Coastal wetland loss
is a major environmental problem affecting coastlines worldwide.  The
causes are complex, ranging from global warming, to working coasts supporting critical
infrastructure such as highways, ports, pipelines and navigational waterways of
economic significance. Without coastal restoration, people and businesses will
be forced to retreat from coastal areas which results in severe economic
consequences to various areas.
Coastal erosion refers
to land receding along the coastline due to erosion of soil. As humans we have
built habitations along the coastline, flooding of these areas present a
serious danger to human safety and to property. Coastal erosion results from
storms, such as hurricanes, and human activities, such as building on the
wetlands and destroying this ecosystem. Global warming has led to rising sea levels,
which results in disappearing shorelines
The founders of
Project SERV have created a method by which
shellfish larvae are grown in large numbers and released in a natural setting,
beginning earlier in the season than is typically done. This can take the form
of enclosed reef structures; i.e. oyster reefs or clam and scallop swarms where
suitable substrate exists. This system mimics and boosts natural systems.
The spawning of
shellfish has occurred for 4000 plus years and the methods have not varied much
until now. 
Our patented
technology produces more shellfish numbers at twice the rate then
current methods and  and focuses on the bio-remediation of reefs and
ecosystem restoration as opposed to hatchery food production.
Shellfish have
supported civilizations for millenniums from Romans to railroad workers in
California in the 1800s. It is theorized that oyster and tuber diet lead to the
survival of the human race some 193,000 years ago during along glacial stage known
as Marine Isotope Stage 6 (MIS6) where only a few thousand breeding individuals
still existed in South Africa. This and the fact that shellfish shells
throughout the millenniums have trapped enough atmospheric carbon to allow life
as we know it, shows a positive correlation between our survival and shellfish
survival.
In 1864 alone, 700
million European flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) were consumed in London,
employing up to 120,000 men in Britain to dredge oysters.
Shell piles in the
southwest of France contain over 1 trillion shells apiece, underscoring both
the productivity of the native species and the scale of harvest.
In the 1870s,
inter-tidal reefs of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) extended
for miles along the main axis of the James River in Chesapeake Bay but had
largely disappeared by the 1940s.
Native bivalve
shellfish provide a variety of ecologically and economically valuable services.
As “ecosystem engineers” shellfish influence the environment around them in
ways that benefit other species – and therefore benefit people and our economy.
In many places, walls
and jetties are built to defend coastlines from erosion; in many places
revitalized reefs could provide this protection and offer many additional
services as well.
Project SERV Inc, with
our patented technology, can provide an environmentally sustainable solution
for coastal mitigation issues that are occurring on a world-wide basis!

Risks & Challenges
Our greatest risk and
challenge is not being able to receive the support we need in order to work
properly. Without financial support we can not:

Hire personnel and contractors
Order equipment and supplies for the Shellfish
     Set Trap Systems, 
Pay for insurance, advertising, pay rent and
     provide maintenance for our facilities.

We are a dedicated
group however! We have worked for 5 years on a shoestring budget and have
managed to have an office, done two successful proof of concept studies and are
currently working with SUNY Southampton to provide Shellfish Set Trap Systems
in order to restore oyster reefs on the south shore of Long Island in

Initially a huge hole was dug measuring 225 square meters filled with ""hand made"" concrete blocks.Then carefully covered with a concrete flooring with a slight amber shape.Using large 15 foot wooden planks enabled the foundation to stand above floor level, vital to avoid flooding and damp damage.Luckily I managed to obtain a petrol engined concrete mixer from a building firm in the UK who generously offered one as a donation, so concrete no longer had to mixed by hand. If you ever had experience of mixing concrete in the hot sun you'll understand  the toil and sweat involved.!Concrete foundation beginning to take shape !Foundation completedFinally after numerous long days the concrete foundation is completed and  the guys  have done such a great job. Now the 'real work' of making and laying the mud bricks into the shape of a five bed room guest house started in earnest. Eight thousand mud bricks were made by hand as seen in the campaign card photograph.
Reasons for using mud bricks  :
1. Emphasizing the traditional practice and skill of mud brick making.
2. Creating a beautiful building encompassing of orangery brown mud bricks which are both strong and pretty.  
 3. Utilizing local skilled workers earning money to feed their families.
4. Offering future guests a comfortable stay and a good nights sleep due to the coolness a mud brick building offers 
Mud bricks enjoying the warmth of sunshineThe completed mud bricks are placed out in the sun on the hard concrete foundation and given at least four/ five weeks or longer to dry out. The longer they are left the harder they become, and here is the first batch of mud bricks. Every morning the bricks are sprayed lightly with water which gives them some moisture. Mud brick makers are extremely skilled, handling them carefully using an antiquated tool which offers a consistent size and quality. As you might be aware constructing a building is no easy task , but with help from array of skilled workers the outer walls of the building are progressing without mishaps. The village Chief offered considerable support to the project and welcomed the development of  Eco tourism in Kitti village. Many Gambians rely on the tourist industry which is a major earner for the  economy.Learning new skills I am now able to mix concrete accurately, make mud bricks, whilst managing numerous workers on site. All the building materials are bought locally including stone from the quarry, sand , mud brick mixture and 50 kg cement bags transported by lorry onto the work site. A local villager supplied the cement bags enabling him to develop his small scale micro business, due to the amount of orders I placed.That was great news !               Guest rooms beginning to take shape Proudly observing the work achieved so far ""Alieu"" welcomes break time with a big smile and an opportunity to reflect on the work achieved so far ! The next stage of the building process is  completing the four concrete corner pillars and bands around the whole building.Strong concrete support will provide the building with increased  strength, longevity and comfortably hold the weight of the roof. Unable to afford an architect fees I designed the building myself which not only saved money, but offered me another challenge to overcome ! The ongoing project has employed local people, highlighting the needs of countryside dwellers.Proud to be part of this development has encouraged some villagers to consider the idea of a mud brick business to meet local demands.    Great job Captain coming along nicely !Omar nicknamed ""Captain""  one of the master builders is putting finishing touches to the corner pillars. The ply- boards used are removed within 48 hours allowing the concrete bands and pylons to dry thoroughly. Using this technique proved useful in containing the shape and concrete mixture for the concrete bands. The combination of steel pylons and concrete gives added strength to the building. As a joint project the villagers are able to earn wages and be involved in the long term process of developing a sustainable business. This Eco friendly building takes into consideration the local environment, utilizing local materials and the practical use of solar energy. Once the roof has being constructed solar panels can be installed, providing all the energy needs for the building. Gambia guarantees constant sunshine during both the dry and wet season ranging from 6 - 10 hours daily.  Wow ! The building is beginning to take shape presenting a strong structure, based upon a solid foundation and accurately built walls. The next stage will be the supported triangles which will give further shape to the building, and offer support for the wooden roof structure. This architectural drawing shows the outline of the roof structure built with red wood otherwise known as 'Iron Wood' which is resistant to wood eating insects. The idea is to create a building with a long 'shelf life', avoiding major additional maintenance costs, using the best quality wood.Transported from over the border in neighboring Southern Senegal I am able to obtain the best quality wood at excellent prices. Kitti village is located only 7 miles from the border with cross border business encouraged to help both local economies.The same tribal groups are located in both countries with many people visiting family and friends.Please excuse me for the scribble on the drawing !I hope you are getting a 'feel' for the work involved so far, which has come along way from the early planning stages.There is still an immense amount of work to be completed, but the team is looking forward to continuing the project shortly. Baboucarr a structural engineer worked out the dimensions and calculations  needed for the roof construction. I was really indebted for the invaluable help he provided and felt confident that the strength of the building could hold the roof comfortably without any mishaps !       This pie chart demonstrates a breakdown of costs involvedBudget costs spent so far :Cost of land Shipping costs of imported materials & household items Cost of digging well & materialsMud brick machinery rental costsTruck loads of stone, sand, & mud brick mortarBags of cement Transportation cost of raw materials Storage costs & security General tools on building site - Plywood boards & large wooden planks for foundation construction/ concrete bollards & bands  Steel & other accessories Food for workersElectrical wiring - sockets- lightning accessories  Thick Green corrugated roofingDoors & locks Skilled workers & unskilled labor costs Costs = £20000 I am realistic about the remaining  budget needed. Please see the following outcomes :Laboring  costs of Skilled workers & laborers 
Indoor furniture  -Locally made Kitchen construction & breakfast barBathrooms- including showers & toilet facilities 
Slate tiling & accessories  Fresh water well connection - piping and solar pumpRoofing materials / nails / screws / & accessoriesIndustrial pump and pipingPlastering tools & plasterCosts of saw mill 250 pieces of wood assorted shapes and sizes - Red woodSolar panels, batteries, fuse box  & installationCompletion of sewage system & piping Pluming of household & connections Wooden door frames , windows & doors Bags of cementTruck loads of stone & sandTransportation costs Food for workers Remaining budget costs  = £ 18000 
Concluding statement I'm sure you have enjoyed reading our experiences of building a mud brick retreat in a poor & undeveloped village ! Considerable work needs to be completed on the building, but with your support the Mellow Yellow Mud Brick Retreat will be a success.If you are unable to offer any financial support please help by spreading the word about our Eco development.   `   Finally Boat trip & fresh fish for dinner if you donate  £500 +In the future Kitti Village looks forward to offering adventurous guests a chance to explore a wonderful cultural experience.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

Check out our OCT webpage with further information, explanations and videos from supporters, scientists and up to 100 answered questions:<br/><a href=""https://www.obrist-c-transformer.com/platform"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.obrist-c-transformer.com</a></strong></p><p>What happens when a tree-hugger, a technical mathematician, an expert in emission avoidance and some scientists from the US and Austria are working together? <strong>Something good for Mother Nature and humankind.</strong></p><p>The world's most burning problem today is climate change. How we deal with it will determine if we have a future or if we will join the dinosaurs. We've noticed that everyone is telling us what we shouldn't do, but nobody is telling us what we can do. <strong>We want to change that.</strong></p><p>Throwing all our knowledge together in one pot and observing nature gave us the idea for the OBRIST C-Transformer. A machine that will combine many different technologies and navigate through our forests. <strong>A machine inspired by nature and created for nature</strong> to overcome what our planet cannot manage by itself anymore, and ultimately, what caused climate change: CO<sub>2</sub> produced by humans. </p><p>We have the concept and scientific proof.<br/>Now we need you to help us make it a reality and to transform our planet together.</p><div> </div><h3>Why this is important</h3><p>Through various forms of transportation and industries we have caused an extremely high amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. We have destroyed the natural balance and nature cannot cope anymore.</p><p>The OBRIST C-Transformer will use natural resources to possibly not only stop climate change, but also to create a chance to turn it around. It will utilize the natural process of the trees to pull CO<sub>2</sub> from the air. The technologies needed will be optimized for the OBRIST C-Transformer to ensure the ability to act as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>Why it works</strong></p><p><i>Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is necessary for plants and trees to grow. Forests play a specific and important role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, storing carbon above and below the ground, and producing oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis</i> (US Department of Agriculture Forest Service)</p><p>However, without the OBRIST C-Transformer our forests are close to CO<sub>2</sub> neutral. This means they bind and release almost similar amouts of carbon during their life span. With the help of the OBRIST C-Transformer, our forests will be revitalized and able to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere for the long term.</p><div>
<strong>How?</strong> Before a tree dies and releases its carbon, which has been stored in its wood during its life span back into the atmosphere, the OBRIST C-Transformer will turn its trunk into biochar and introduce it into the forest's ground. In this manner, the carbon improves soil fertility and <strong>the release of carbon back into our atmosphere is prevented.</strong>
</div><div> </div><div>Even more, the OBRIST C-Transformer will not only address the problem of too much CO<sub>2</sub> in our atmosphere, but simultaneously it will help revitalize our forests by planting new trees and seedlings, leading to a greater biodiversity and creating healthy, self-sustaining and thriving ecosystems. In this manner, <strong>it could be optimally used to transform areas of monoculture into lively permaculture. </strong>

<h3>Results</h3>
<div>
<strong>The OBRIST C-Transformer will be a long-term solution for our environment. </strong>After having reached the point of worldwide carbon neutrality, the OBRIST C-Transformer <strong>can continue to actually reverse climate change </strong>and keep converting our forest areas into forests full of healthy biodiversity. This will make them self-sustaining, just like forests used to be before we humans destroyed the balance.</div>
</div><div> </div><div>Another key factor is the economic stimulation of areas which are usually economically low by providing an opportunity to generate revenue from these forests without destroying the natural biodiversity.

Check out our OCT webpage with further information, explanations and videos from supporters, scientists and up to 100 answered questions:www.obrist-c-transformer.comWhat happens when a tree-hugger, a technical mathematician, an expert in emission avoidance and some scientists from the US and Austria are working together? Something good for Mother Nature and humankind.The world's most burning problem today is climate change. How we deal with it will determine if we have a future or if we will join the dinosaurs. We've noticed that everyone is telling us what we shouldn't do, but nobody is telling us what we can do. We want to change that.Throwing all our knowledge together in one pot and observing nature gave us the idea for the OBRIST C-Transformer. A machine that will combine many different technologies and navigate through our forests. A machine inspired by nature and created for nature to overcome what our planet cannot manage by itself anymore, and ultimately, what caused climate change: CO2 produced by humans. We have the concept and scientific proof.Now we need you to help us make it a reality and to transform our planet together. Why this is importantThrough various forms of transportation and industries we have caused an extremely high amount of CO2 emissions. We have destroyed the natural balance and nature cannot cope anymore.The OBRIST C-Transformer will use natural resources to possibly not only stop climate change, but also to create a chance to turn it around. It will utilize the natural process of the trees to pull CO2 from the air. The technologies needed will be optimized for the OBRIST C-Transformer to ensure the ability to act as quickly as possible. Why it worksCarbon dioxide in the atmosphere is necessary for plants and trees to grow. Forests play a specific and important role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, storing carbon above and below the ground, and producing oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis (US Department of Agriculture Forest Service)However, without the OBRIST C-Transformer our forests are close to CO2 neutral. This means they bind and release almost similar amouts of carbon during their life span. With the help of the OBRIST C-Transformer, our forests will be revitalized and able to reduce CO2 from the atmosphere for the long term.
How? Before a tree dies and releases its carbon, which has been stored in its wood during its life span back into the atmosphere, the OBRIST C-Transformer will turn its trunk into biochar and introduce it into the forest's ground. In this manner, the carbon improves soil fertility and the release of carbon back into our atmosphere is prevented.
 Even more, the OBRIST C-Transformer will not only address the problem of too much CO2 in our atmosphere, but simultaneously it will help revitalize our forests by planting new trees and seedlings, leading to a greater biodiversity and creating healthy, self-sustaining and thriving ecosystems. In this manner, it could be optimally used to transform areas of monoculture into lively permaculture. 
  
Results

The OBRIST C-Transformer will be a long-term solution for our environment. After having reached the point of worldwide carbon neutrality, the OBRIST C-Transformer can continue to actually reverse climate change and keep converting our forest areas into forests full of healthy biodiversity. This will make them self-sustaining, just like forests used to be before we humans destroyed the balance.
 Another key factor is the economic stimulation of areas which are usually economically low by providing an opportunity to generate revenue from these forests without destroying the natural biodiversity. The OBRIST C-Transformer will impulse the reforestation of harvested areas and the afforestation of degraded monoculture areas. The OBRIST C-TransformerCreating fertile soil. Planting new trees.

Parce que seuls nous ne sommes qu'une goutte d'eau, mais ensemble nous sommes un fleuve, aidez-nous à remonter le courant!MERCI INFINIMENT! --------------------------------------- ENGLISH VERSIONPROJECT DESCRIPTION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Encountering the Guardians of the Forest Film is a feature-length documentary film in the Amazon, highlighting examples of protection in the Amazon rainforest, while linking with environmental issues in Canada.This project will involve the team’s journey across the Amazonian region from east to west, from Brazil to Ecuador, through Peru, to meet the guardians of the forest.PHILOSOPHY OF THE PROJECT: We usually hear about the Amazon in terms of the disappearance of the forest, its fauna and flora, the forest cover that disappears every day and the urgency to act. This can lead to feeling helpless in the face of what seems inevitable. This project focuses on the protection of the Amazon rainforest but instead of focusing on its disappearance, it puts forward initiatives to protect forests and people who live there.THE PROJECT'S OBJECTIVES :
To meet the protectors of the forest. These people can be guides for humanity in the ecological crisis. As part of this project we will meet them, help give voice to their struggles, present their vision and explore their strategies to protect these beautiful ecosystems they inhabit.
Documenting environmental protection initiatives - Put forward initiatives to protect people and the people who live there.
Share the idea that we can all make changes in our lifestyles and commit to protecting the environment.
It is therefore both a human and cultural challenge as well as a communication project that will be featured in a film, conferences, on a website and in interviews with the media.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

My dream is to build a pollution free solar power plant that will generate sustainable energy supply and at the same time be environment friendly. Fossil fuels such as Coal and Natural Gas are leading pollutants contributing to climate change.<br/></p>
<p>We all talk about our planet and our environment. We spend time 
researching and debating climate change and global warming.  We can 
sit around doing nothing or we can take a stand and begin making 
changes. I am all for spreading the word and educating on this important
 issue but talk alone cannot insight change. I believe to see change we each need to take a stand and the time is now. <br/></p>
<p> I need your help to make my dream a reality. With your financial contribution we will be able to make definite difference!</p>

<ul>
<li>My idea is to build a 50,000 Watt (50 kW) solar power plant. I have an aggressive plan to get this done in a year so we can start making a difference ASAP. Initially, I became interested in the idea when I decided to use solar energy to power my backyard fountain. The insight I gained through my experience with the project lead me to think of more ways to use solar power. By harnessing the power of the sun we have a source of renewable energy that is clean and environmentally safe.  Solar power usage will help reduce our dependence on fossil fuel which in turn will leave greener footprints that benefits our communities and our planet. <br/>
</li>
<li>Let me till you a bit more about myself and my background. My name is Thureen Khan and I am a Software Engineer. I have 8 years of experience as a Software Engineer having worked on projects such as the NASA's Space Shuttle, GeoEye Satellite images for Google Earth, etc. Furthermore, I have recently completed a Master Degree in System Engineer Management (SEM). My SEM degree enables me to fully utilize all my training and talent to proficiently navigate every stage of management ensuring success.</li>
<li>With your contribution we can start making immediate impacts. As my graphic shows 50 kW is enough power to make us stop using 14,500 trees or 5.8 million pounds of coal!  In fact, 50 kW should enough to power 10 medium size household for an entire year. Join me in starting this project today so we can start making a difference!</li>

 Tyreless Limited exists purely and simply to provide businesses and local communities a service to ensure that waste tyres are reused, recycled and repurposed responsibly. That means not put into landfill, or exported abroad or other markets to burn as fuel, as other companies do! Our ultimate goal and vision is to work with businesses and local governments to ensure that tyre waste is disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner; ultimately we believe that a sustainable industry is achievable in the rubber industry and as such have an ethos that where possible we will work with makers of tyres and other rubber products to ensure that ""no new rubber"" is used in production of rubber goods but instead recycled alternatives to ensure sustainable industry.

<p><b>HOW IT WILL WORK</b>: Embedded in the 'walls' of this BAOBAB TREE will be custom-built brooders that will be home to the rescued chicks. The rearers will work from within the TREE to provide the food, warmth, humidity and care that they need. The mentor birds will be housed in the aviaries radiating out from the BAOBAB. This will provide the right social learning environment to ensure that the chicks develop all the correct behavioural cues that they need to go on and be strong founders of a new generation of ground-hornbills. </p>
<p>They will fledge into these groups and from there they will be moved to a large pre-release aviary where they will undergo full health checks while they bond with their new groups. Then they will be moved to soft release aviaries at the release sites. This will ensure they have already learnt to hunt, fly, and perch before they are released into the big wide world under the care of an experienced older mentor bird in a 'bush-school'. </p>

HELP US MAKE A DIFFERENCE


SOUTHERN GROUND-HORNBILL POPULATIONS ARE DECLINING TO CRITICALLY ENDANGERED 

BUT THERE IS HOPE

This culturally and ecologically important species is severly at risk. 


We can double the productivity of
wild nests by harvesting 'doomed' second-hatched chicks but they need to be reared
WILD & STRONG to survive in the wild. They need to 'speak'
ground-hornbill and be fearful of humans. 
We are raising funds to build a specialised hand-rearing facility: much
like those used for both the California Condor and Peregrine Falcon recovery
programmes, a cradle for this next generation that will maximise their survival once reintroduced into the wild.  
Mpumalanga Parks and Tourism
Agency (MTPA) has provided us with land.  We have a super simple, baobab shaped, state
of the art rearing centre designed to ensure the very best for these chicks. 
WE NOW NEED YOUR HELP: to raise $100 000 so we can
build our rearing centre in time for the next breeding season. 



THE ISSUES: 
We, in South Africa, are faced with this species disappearing from our savannah and grasslands - only an estimated 500 breeding females are left and declines are reported in all other range states. Namibia - Endangered. Kenya - down to fewer than 300 individuals.. and so it goes.



They are accidentally poisoned by farmers trying to poison jackals and leopards.


They are electrocuted on a growing electricity infrastructure.


They are targeted for trade - both for traditional medicine and ritual and for zoos and private collections.

They are persecuted for breaking windows - a territorial response to their reflection.

Their habitat and nest trees are being lost in the face of development.


Now that we have successful protocols for rearing worked out, we need to increase the scale of what we do to be able to test the reintroduction protocols and so ensure the programme is sustainable. For this we need a centralised hand-rearing facility - much like those used for both the California Condor and Peregrine Falcon recovery programmes. 
Your contribution, no matter how much, will ensure that we can successfully produce enough good-quality, strong, healthy birds to release back into the wild.  

   HOW YOU CAN HELP 
We
need $100 000 to start the building in time for the next breeding
season. Time is a critical factor with an Endangered species. See the plans
below for this state-of-the-art but super-simple facility, perfect for
ground-hornbills. Our major partner in this venture - Mpumalanga Parks and
Tourism Agency (MTPA) - has provided the land, and after an intense workshop
with stakeholders, the concept of the BAOBAB was developed.

This BAOBAB TREE will give life to the next generation of the species. 



HOW IT WILL WORK: Embedded in the 'walls' of this BAOBAB TREE will be custom-built brooders that will be home to the rescued chicks. The rearers will work from within the TREE to provide the food, warmth, humidity and care that they need. The mentor birds will be housed in the aviaries radiating out from the BAOBAB. This will provide the right social learning environment to ensure that the chicks develop all the correct behavioural cues that they need to go on and be strong founders of a new generation of ground-hornbills. 
They will fledge into these groups and from there they will be moved to a large pre-release aviary where they will undergo full health checks while they bond with their new groups. Then they will be moved to soft release aviaries at the release sites. This will ensure they have already learnt to hunt, fly, and perch before they are released into the big wide world under the care of an experienced older mentor bird in a 'bush-school'. 


WHAT WE NEED THE FUNDING FOR:

All funds collected will be processed through our non-profit account and will thus be audited to ensure that we are accountable for the spending. Our financial reports are always available to ensure transparent, ethical reporting. As we need to build the centre to progress with the reintroduction programme we will initiate building as funds become available, starting with the perimeter fence around our current aviaries and then continuing to build from there. 

 
HOW WE CAN THANK YOU

For your role in the recovery of this species, we can offer the following perks to match every level of your support. Choose what level of support you would like and receive the perk for that level. 
Thank you!

$5

ABOUT THE MABULA GROUND HORNBILL PROJECT


We have been working to slow and then reverse the decline of this species since 1999, in collaboration and partnership with a large number of stakeholders: academic institutions, non-profit organisations, land-owners, private, provincial, and national game reserves and traditional authorities. 
see more: www.ground-hornbill.org.za

We have developed and refined several conservation mitigations, including that of reintroductions. 

We have a large and expanding outreach programme to ensure that both communities where remaining wild populations exist and areas targeted for reintroductions are aware of the species and the threats they face. 


We work to mitigate the threats that the remaining wild populations face.

We have a growing research programme: genetics, health, hormones, artificial nest development, custodianship and more...

We are committed to capacity building for conservation.

The director's camera follows cyclists through traffic and across town to interviews where a wide range of people explain and describe their love for cycling, and its potential to both redesign, and help save the city.Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret (USA, 2014, Korean subtitles) asks why Greenpeace and other NGOs seem to ignore the meat and dairy industries' direct contributions to abrupt climate change. Co-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio, this popular film is thoughtful, informative, and funny, and has changed menus in homes and restaurants around the world. Come share the secret: learn the truths of the Cowspiracy.

Challenges


This festival is run on volunteer hours.
We've talked with the directors, and scheduled visits and shows. 
Creative members have contributed work for logos, posters, the promotional clip above, and booked the community center's theater. 
We're all ready to go with this festival... but still need to pay for the directors' visits, to print posters, and screening rights.
We expect participants' ticket sales to cover less than half these costs.
In the unlikely event that more than enough is raised, any excess funds will be spent on translating more subtitles for new movies for next year's festival:
The Yes Men Are RevoltingRacing ExtinctionThis Changes EverythingLive and Let Live
and/or any new title from Korea or overseas that connects dots on the challenges of climate change.

Help us raise the questions that need to be asked and present the information and ideas to make informed decisions.

<p>Led by Madhava MS Hebbar, who qualified as Master of Design from INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (IIT) Mumbai. Has traveled and lived in Singapore &amp; Finland as a consultant for start-ups in the field of Web Design. Later once back in India, took interest to know the nitty-gritty of chemical free farming from the doyen of Zero Budget Natural Farming., Mr Subash Palekar. While under training Madhava understood the importance of local cows which are known to the scientists as BOS INDICUS / ZEBU or A2 Type cows - These cows are known for their high quality milk which has Beta Caesin Protein and an stable amino acid chain Proline., and their poo or dung contains friendly microbes that help soil fertility.</p>
<p>Thus, a small team was formed to synergize marginal farmers in the rural belts of Bangalore City, where the survey asserted there were over 3 lac Zebu A2 Bos-Indicus bovines on a natural tract that stretched 165 kms.</p>

</div><div>
Indigenous Bovines are the integral part of the eco-system of a bio climatic zone which we are working on. India has an unique eco-centric agricultural system where both animal husbandry and cultivation go hand in hand. India is the only country on Earth blessed with four crop cycles. Indian ancient agricultural methods made farmer self-sufficient and sustainable and was absolutely chemical free. Our campaign is to revive it by synergizing marginal farmers with Indigenous Bovines which are now considered as most evolved species on Earth - The BOS INDICUS.</div><div>Our campaign started in 2007, where we networked with villages on the natural tract. Over 40 villages were shortlisted and soon we started to supply a2 milk to the city of Bangalore which is the hub of international community who are aware of a2 milk, which is more a health drink and harbinger of good life. a2 Milk or Desi Milk as its known in local populace is much appreciated.</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442039889/n1kpfvsn2k7vuorobn6w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We arranged vehicles, milk cans and milk testing equipment and created a module for 10 villages to start with., to supply 500 liters of milk every morning. We collected milk only once a day, as rest of the milk was needed for the calf. Farmers got a premium price of $ 0.5 and was supplied to procurer patrons at $ 1.</span></p></div><div>At present our VILLAGE LEVEL Collectives have over 10,000 Bos Indicus / Zebu / a2 Type Cows and this has multiple revenue areas for the farmers, that include Ayurveda Medicine, Chemical free vegetables and BIO GAS generation out of cow poo. </div><div>All our research, archiving, promotion and awareness campaign, salaries to the employees in rural and urban areas, at present come from the revenue out of a2 milk. Now the requirement is to scale the project and bring in more revenue for the farmer synergy so that bovines can be improved upon. </div><div>

<p><b>Goal or target :</b></p>
Our target is elite populace in city of Bangalore which has a cosmopolitan crowd from all over INDIA and Abroad. There are quite few expats who understand the a2 milk as the brand is famous now in Australia, UK, USofA, Brazil and NZ.
</div><div>Over a period of 5 years we will be able to suffice the demand upto 50,000 liters provided we scale methodically.</div><div>Unless the investment reaches the villages with indigenous a2 type cows and stabilizes the network to a socio participation model, dynamics can not be substantiated. Thence its very important to put up the proper state-of-art infrastructure to support the campaign that helps marginal farmers. As of now non of the institutions or governmental bodies are focusing on issues. We are sure FOOD INDUSTRY will be the next revolution in INDIA for which we have to gear up marginal farmers and synergize them for the sake of good health and better environment.</div><div>We are constantly upgrading and are in touch with resource people in the area and the institutions.</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441963162/cjgrrov3k3hphrqdx1a8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>
<b>The Impact :</b><br/>
</div><div>We can frame the impact as multi-pronged and pro-nature as below :<br/>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Synergizing marginal farmers on natural tract means, preserving the bio-reserve of the natural tract we work in.</li>
<li>Whole tract of 165 Kms which is a stretch of hills and dales has several water bodies and rivers - rivulet that flows. If this is secured now, its better not just for INDIA but becomes the model for rest of the developing world that how important it is to keep the environment intact along side the economic growth.</li>
<li>Multiple revenue model means, more interest in keeping the indigenous species along with rest of flora and fauna. Its not just about milk.</li>
<li>Most important part of this campaign is, it builds human to human trust, helps multiple participation from both Rural and Urban side, and gives lots of scope for environment based research.</li>
<li>Besides everything the campaign, if made successful can bring the worlds attention on a proper issue based democratic principles. Where collectivism and capitalism go hand in hand.</li>

Led by Madhava MS Hebbar, who qualified as Master of Design from INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (IIT) Mumbai. Has traveled and lived in Singapore & Finland as a consultant for start-ups in the field of Web Design. Later once back in India, took interest to know the nitty-gritty of chemical free farming from the doyen of Zero Budget Natural Farming., Mr Subash Palekar. While under training Madhava understood the importance of local cows which are known to the scientists as BOS INDICUS / ZEBU or A2 Type cows - These cows are known for their high quality milk which has Beta Caesin Protein and an stable amino acid chain Proline., and their poo or dung contains friendly microbes that help soil fertility.
Thus, a small team was formed to synergize marginal farmers in the rural belts of Bangalore City, where the survey asserted there were over 3 lac Zebu A2 Bos-Indicus bovines on a natural tract that stretched 165 kms.

Importance of the Campaign

Indigenous Bovines are the integral part of the eco-system of a bio climatic zone which we are working on. India has an unique eco-centric agricultural system where both animal husbandry and cultivation go hand in hand. India is the only country on Earth blessed with four crop cycles. Indian ancient agricultural methods made farmer self-sufficient and sustainable and was absolutely chemical free. Our campaign is to revive it by synergizing marginal farmers with Indigenous Bovines which are now considered as most evolved species on Earth - The BOS INDICUS.Our campaign started in 2007, where we networked with villages on the natural tract. Over 40 villages were shortlisted and soon we started to supply a2 milk to the city of Bangalore which is the hub of international community who are aware of a2 milk, which is more a health drink and harbinger of good life. a2 Milk or Desi Milk as its known in local populace is much appreciated.We arranged vehicles, milk cans and milk testing equipment and created a module for 10 villages to start with., to supply 500 liters of milk every morning. We collected milk only once a day, as rest of the milk was needed for the calf. Farmers got a premium price of $ 0.5 and was supplied to procurer patrons at $ 1.At present our VILLAGE LEVEL Collectives have over 10,000 Bos Indicus / Zebu / a2 Type Cows and this has multiple revenue areas for the farmers, that include Ayurveda Medicine, Chemical free vegetables and BIO GAS generation out of cow poo. All our research, archiving, promotion and awareness campaign, salaries to the employees in rural and urban areas, at present come from the revenue out of a2 milk. Now the requirement is to scale the project and bring in more revenue for the farmer synergy so that bovines can be improved upon. 

ContributorsWe are looking for the contributors who understand that environment is safe when eco-system is intact and bio-reserve rejuvenated. Economics should take care of environment..not the vice versa. For that we have to work a newer and creative cycle of blending urban and rural economics by DIRECT LINK-UP of rural producer to urban procurer.There could be multiple revenue area which even an contributor can develop or participate in. Our forte is organising the synergy both at Producer and Procurer end., at the same time give scope for science to percolate to the grassroot farmers.We have 2 hectares of land kept to develop Micro-dairy modules., and to scale the project we need :

50x50 mtrs shed for installations.
Chillers and Packaging equipment
Freezers and cold storage
BIOGAS electricity generators
Diesel Gensets
Skilled Human Power
Training facilities
Front-end promotional office at Bangalore city.

Contributors can have direct access and also create their own social business plans on our network., as there is enormous opportunities in research on these a2 bovines and their inputs for sustainability.

Fiscal dialogue :
Procuring price of milk is USD 0.5 and Supply price is USD 1.1
Supply capacity of the module : 5000 liters ( above projected infrastructure and human-power.
Present Demand in the city : 50,000 liters at present in Bangalore.
Gross revenue per day : USD 5833/-
Gross revenue per month : USD 175000/-
Gross revenue per year : USD 210000/-
Gross revenue for 5 years : USD 10500000/-


Goal or target :
Our target is elite populace in city of Bangalore which has a cosmopolitan crowd from all over INDIA and Abroad. There are quite few expats who understand the a2 milk as the brand is famous now in Australia, UK, USofA, Brazil and NZ.
Over a period of 5 years we will be able to suffice the demand upto 50,000 liters provided we scale methodically.Unless the investment reaches the villages with indigenous a2 type cows and stabilizes the network to a socio participation model, dynamics can not be substantiated. Thence its very important to put up the proper state-of-art infrastructure to support the campaign that helps marginal farmers. As of now non of the institutions or governmental bodies are focusing on issues. We are sure FOOD INDUSTRY will be the next revolution in INDIA for which we have to gear up marginal farmers and synergize them for the sake of good health and better environment.We are constantly upgrading and are in touch with resource people in the area and the institutions.
The Impact :
We can frame the impact as multi-pronged and pro-nature as below :


Synergizing marginal farmers on natural tract means, preserving the bio-reserve of the natural tract we work in.
Whole tract of 165 Kms which is a stretch of hills and dales has several water bodies and rivers - rivulet that flows. If this is secured now, its better not just for INDIA but becomes the model for rest of the developing world that how important it is to keep the environment intact along side the economic growth.
Multiple revenue model means, more interest in keeping the indigenous species along with rest of flora and fauna. Its not just about milk.
Most important part of this campaign is, it builds human to human trust, helps multiple participation from both Rural and Urban side, and gives lots of scope for environment based research.
Besides everything the campaign, if made successful can bring the worlds attention on a proper issue based democratic principles. Where collectivism and capitalism go hand in hand.




Risks & Challenges
We are qualified, as we have run this campaign without any external help. Have made it a small successful module of 500 liters. Japanese Company Aisin visited our network of villages and that bears the testimony that we are making ourselves known in collectivism. By their visit we are certain to have prototypes from Aisin to generate power at rural end - upto 5 kva using cow poo.Since we work on a tract which is 165 km a stretch and covers over 200 villages and hamlets with indigenous bovines., if our campaign is made success by people participation, then it can be a revenue earning model which is fueled by farmers themselves. This brings a new confidence among the rural class to organise beyond institutions and governmental bodies. Since the team is over 30 personals - guided by experts., and empowerment of the team members is the forte till now, the skill sets are improved upon to become better managers.As such India is known for human management due to enormous population. All it needs is proper impetus to create synergy that can take care of both environment and economics through value & merit based empowerment.Risk :As we see its only the wrath of nature, or natural calamities that can create a collateral damage.Challenges :Keeping the synergy on is a biggest challenge. But that can be organised and brought to books by agreements and loyality points to the rural synergy.Solving problems or overcoming challenges is by using proper human management based on human values and usage of technology for transformation. Be it simple testing procedures or android based technology for information transfer.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

CHOCOAN RAINFOREST, THE BROWN-HEADED SPIDER MONKEYS AND CACAO PRODUCERS: HOW
ARE THEY RELATED? </b></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Although often overshadowed by the famed Amazonian rainforest, the Ecuadorian Chocó region is one of the most biodiverse places on earth and provides home to a vast array of fascinating plant and animal species. It is among the tall trees of these beautiful forests that the Ecuadorian brown-headed spider monkeys make their home. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">However, this area continues to be severely threatened by uncontrolled deforestation  via logging and the expansion of agricultural monocultures such as </span>palm<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> oil.  It is estimated that around 98% of the original forest cover has already been lost and these beautiful primates have been left on the brink of extinction. </span></span></p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Nestled among the pristine primary rainforests in the NW province of Esmeraldas, the small farming community of Tesoro Escondido is host to one of the few remaining healthy populations of brown-headed spider monkeys. Unfortunately, this is a region where poverty is rife and historically these people have relied upon logging to supplement the low income they make selling unfairly traded cacao.<br/>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The Chocó Project, a joint initiative created by the University of Sussex, Proyecto Washu and Fundación Cambugán, has been working with this community in order to protect these forests and their inhabitants from further destruction.

Did you know that Ecuadorian small-producers cultivate some of the best cacao in the world?                     


And have you heard of the Ecuadorian Brown-headed spider monkey?                  


            
The
former suffers from unfair trade regulations and economic instability while the latter is on the brink of extinction. Here at the Chocó project we are working hard to find a solution to these problems by combining them in a unique and innovative enterprise which we invite you to be a part of.
Let us take you on a little journey to the rainforests of
the Ecuadorian Chocó, to a magical place we call Tesoro Escondido (‘Hidden
Treasure’). You will meet brown-headed spider monkeys and cacao producers,
learn about the project and discover our unique vision. By the end of the tale, we
hope that you will be inspired to join us in our venture by supporting the project and sharing our story with friends and family. 
THE
CHOCOAN RAINFOREST, THE BROWN-HEADED SPIDER MONKEYS AND CACAO PRODUCERS: HOW
ARE THEY RELATED? 
Although often overshadowed by the famed Amazonian rainforest, the Ecuadorian Chocó region is one of the most biodiverse places on earth and provides home to a vast array of fascinating plant and animal species. It is among the tall trees of these beautiful forests that the Ecuadorian brown-headed spider monkeys make their home. 
However, this area continues to be severely threatened by uncontrolled deforestation  via logging and the expansion of agricultural monocultures such as palm oil.  It is estimated that around 98% of the original forest cover has already been lost and these beautiful primates have been left on the brink of extinction. 
The Ecuadorian brown-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps fusciceps) is now listed among the Top 25 Most Endangered Primates on Earth.






Nestled among the pristine primary rainforests in the NW province of Esmeraldas, the small farming community of Tesoro Escondido is host to one of the few remaining healthy populations of brown-headed spider monkeys. Unfortunately, this is a region where poverty is rife and historically these people have relied upon logging to supplement the low income they make selling unfairly traded cacao.

The Chocó Project, a joint initiative created by the University of Sussex, Proyecto Washu and Fundación Cambugán, has been working with this community in order to protect these forests and their inhabitants from further destruction. Through a combination of environmental education, community development and fair trade we are helping the inhabitants of Tesoro Escondido to seek better, more sustainable livelihoods. 


WHAT DO WE BELIEVE IN AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH YOUR HELP?






The Chocó Project: 
1. Works with schools and local producers to promote conservation strategies to protect the Chocoan rainforest.

2. Facilitates scientific research in the area to generate knowledge and raise
awareness on the challenges facing the Chocoan rainforest.
3. Trains local people from forest communities (parabiologists) to assist local and international researchers . 
4. Allows small cacao producers to access appropriate markets for their high quality
product by contacting buyers across the world on their behalf, helps to improve farming methods and to obtain organic certification. 
5. Provides support for the creation of a cooperative whose aim will be to protect the
rainforest. Through the sale of a high quality organic cacao, the cooperative
will develop sustainable livelihoods for the community and promote forest
conservation.  
And if you want to find out what we've achieved so far and what we've got in mind for the future, click here! 
WHERE IS YOUR MONEY GOING? 
In order to maintain this project for a year, we need USD 40,000. This is how we will use your generous contributions:  



                   

                  
                  
                               
                             
   

               
OUR DESIRED IMPACT

In order to protect the Ecuadorian brown-headed spider monkey, protecting it's forest home and the wide-network of species which  reside there is imperative. Not only do the monkeys and these beautiful forests have incalculable intrinsic value but they also provide vital ecosystem services which the health of the planet relies upon.  

                
The Chocó Project is an innovative and
ambitious conservation model linking communities, Ecuadorian nongovernmental
organisations and national and international researchers, to realise the true
value of these forests and provide livelihoods that compete with
deforestation. We hope that, should we be successful, this model can be replicated in other regions of the world where environmental degradation and poverty are rife. There are many. 

                

THIS IS WHY WE NEED YOU! 
With current global climactic changes set to dramatically affect the environment, showing support for conservation initiatives is more important than ever. Let's make our stand. By sharing our message and donating to our cause, your generous contribution will help us to protect the forests of Tesoro Escondido and improve the livelihoods of the community living there. From them, and from us, thank you.                                               


             
To add to this truly deserved
thanks, we would also like to provide you with a number of unique perks. 
You will be able to
claim colourful postcards of the rainforests of Ecuador, delicious Tesoro
Escondido chocolate gifts, selections of T-shirts, bags and accessories made by
Zigze (http://www.zigze.com/) – the first eco-business in Ecuador whose
designs and illustrations are inspired by the rich flora and fauna of Ecuador –
and trips to the pristine forests of Tesoro Escondido and the seaside town of Puerto López (unfortunately, we do not cover travel expenses but once you’re there everything will be provided!) where you will get to enjoy the relaxing cabins
of Hostería
Itapoa, its beaches and plenty of activities - whale watching, surfing, walks along the malecón!

Ezt nem magyaráznánk túl. Az ehető kanál egy kanál, amit meg lehet enni, azaz nem marad szemét utána. Vagyis csak annyi, mint pl. egy pirítósból, miután megetted. 
Miért jó / fontos ez? 


A fesztiválokon / rendezvényeken / falunapokon ... biztonsági okok miatt nem lehet semmi balesetveszélyes eszköz (fém, porcelán, üveg ..), ezért rengeteg az egyszer használatos műanyag, ami óriási nyersanyag és energia pazarlás.

the seriousness of the water crisis. This is the biggest reason for our

</div></div>","130 TO SAVE 24 BILLION
We are Camel Water and we are asking for your help to make our campaign goal a reality.  The title of this campaign may sound a bit confusing until you know that we're talking about the number of gallons of fresh drinking water that will be saved if we can get just a small percentage of the people in the United States to support our campaign.
If only 10% of the single family detached homes in the United States and Canada harvest, store and use rainwater with our 130 US gallon rainwater harvesting system, the total savings of treated - municipal or well water will be at least 24 BILLION gallons per year.
It's simple and easy to do with a Camel Water System.  People have been harvesting rainwater for thousands of years.  In many places in the world, it's the only viable source of fresh (not salty) water.  Rainwater has many uses including:


Irrigation Exterior cleaning
Excess storm water retention (flood prevention)
Aquifer replenishment (restores underground water supplies when released slowly on the soil)
  Rainwater is very easy and inexpensive to treat (filter and disinfect) making it completely safe for drinking, cooking and bathing.



Camel Water modular rainwater harvesting
     systems are very compact and easy to install using common hand tools. No
     heavy lifting required. A Camel Water module weighs less than 45 lbs.
     Storage capacity is easily expandable, one module at a time. You can add
     as many modules as required without using heavy lifting equipment or
     paying for expensive site preparation.


Our campaign is Focused On Three Fronts


Raising public awareness of the current water crisis and our rainwater harvesting solution through social media and other avenues, including our active role on the research committee of ARCSA - the American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association


Expanding delivery capacity of our ""state-of-the-art"", ultra slim water storage modules that offer superior benefits with virtually none of the headaches of other Rain Water Harvesting Systems (RWHS).  As the public becomes
more aware of how critical our water situation has become and how smart, simple and
easy our solutions are to use, there will be a surge in orders.  We need
to be able to  keep pace with demand. Your contribution makes sure that we
deliver the solutions quickly and effectively.  
Donating Rain Water Harvesting Systems to schools and non-profit organizations. A Camel Water RWHS can also be a great educational tool. Getting our young people and community organizations involved is critical to the success of our campaign. We want everyone to know about wasteful water practices and how to conserve this precious resource. To further this goal, Camel Water, LLC will donate one 130 US gallon rainwater harvesting system to a school or non-profit for every twenty-five we sell.  If you want to join us in donating a RWHS, simply choose that perk and we will insure that it gets done and that you receive the recognition you deserve. You can also keep your donation anonymous if you prefer. 
What We Need & What You Get

Here's what we plan to do with your
support


Improve our internet presence - enlarge and update our
website, web store, Facebook page and Twitter feeds
Expand our participation
with the ARCSA Research
Committee to keep the public up to date on the latest developments in the
growing water crisis that is already impacting tens of millions of people
globally.  Spreading the word broadly requires investment in promotion and
advertising.  Because we feel that this crisis is larger than most people
are aware of, we want to get the word out to the largest possible
audience. 

Produce additional molds for expanded delivery capacity in more
locations. Camel Water storage modules are molded using FDA compliant, food
grade HDPE.  HDPE is a high strength plastic and one of the best materials
for long term outdoor use. With additional molds we will create a Virtual Delivery Network
using roto-molders across the US and Canada, saving shipping costs and
shortening delivery schedules.



What do you get out of it?Depending on your participation level you can:


Gain recognition for supporting our campaign and spreading the word

Show off one of our campaign perks that tells the world you care about water conservation and support the 130 TO SAVE 24 BILLION campaign.



                

Start harvesting and using rainwater and using less of the expensive treated water.
Slow the flow of water from the roofs of our dwellings to the storm drains, giving it a chance to soak back into the ground to replenish the aquifers.
Increase our charitable program of donating a 130-gallon Camel Water rainwater harvesting system to a school or non-profit for every 25 systems that we sell.

Is The Water Crisis Beyond Solving?
It is a growing problem, but we are convinced that, if we
act now, we can prevent things from getting worse, and improve our current
situation. The problem is that we do not have a lot of time.  Our underground rivers (aquifers) are being
badly depleted, which affects wells and springs that we depend on in many
places.  Our climate is changing
unpredictably and we need to act now to prevent the current crisis from
becoming a global catastrophe. Getting the word out and providing
easy to implement solutions needs to happen now.  Delay only invites unnecessary suffering to
millions more people.

Why Isn't Everyone Harvesting Rainwater?



Many people around the
world already do. Unfortunately, most people in America aren't fully aware of
the seriousness of the water crisis. This is the biggest reason for our
campaign. Without the necessary awareness being raised, the solutions won't be
put into use soon enough. We absolutely MUST get people to recognize the

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<p>We are a Mexican-Greek expat family Living actually in Bulgaria in a village Near Cherven Bryag where we got a 5 hectares farm land called ‘’La Adelita’’  we named after my mother back in Mexico which she is one of pioneers of organic food in my family and the best sauces maker in Mexico...</p>
<p>This farm has  85 years of history and we have in mind to turn it into a sustainable Eco- farm where we want to produce Mexican products such as hot sauces, dry hot peppers, many variety of Mexican corn, corn tortillas, mexican  beans, green tomatoes(tomatillos) and  exotic fruits like papaya fruit, passion fruit (maracuya), guava, plantain bananas and mexican tomatoes and more organic vegetables as well which does not exist here in this part of Europe</p>
<p>Our sauces have been tested already in Greece, the Greek islands, Bulgaria and parts in Romania and they had great acceptation between  the people, festivals and restaurants, but now we want to grown as a organic mexican sauces and more products  providers in the whole europe </p>

<h3>Buzz Bikes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi!  I'm J.J. and we here at Buzz Bikes are a little bit wacky.  About 15 years ago I found that combining a kid's scooter with an old conventional rear triangle of a discarded bicycle provided a unique riding experience.  After having great fun riding around on this contraption, I decided to put it in storage.  Recently, I decided to restore the motorcycle to its original glory.  </li>
<li>A lot has happened to battery technology over the past 15 years with the development of new, light, high capacity lithium ion batteries.  Unfortunately they are very expensive while their technology is superior to many other types of batteries.  The improvement of brush-less DC motors and increasing solar cell efficiency now make it feasible to operate a fully solar powered vehicle that could be built for the masses.  This is why we at Buzz Bikes hope to involve wonderful folks, like yourself, in our campaign.</li>
<li>With your contribution, we can take our prototype to the next level and improve upon the current design so that Buzz Bikes can go faster and farther that they ever have before (currently only 4.7 miles a charge) and with free and plentiful sunlight as power!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

Hi!  I'm J.J. and we here at Buzz Bikes are a little bit wacky.  About 15 years ago I found that combining a kid's scooter with an old conventional rear triangle of a discarded bicycle provided a unique riding experience.  After having great fun riding around on this contraption, I decided to put it in storage.  Recently, I decided to restore the motorcycle to its original glory.  
A lot has happened to battery technology over the past 15 years with the development of new, light, high capacity lithium ion batteries.  Unfortunately they are very expensive while their technology is superior to many other types of batteries.  The improvement of brush-less DC motors and increasing solar cell efficiency now make it feasible to operate a fully solar powered vehicle that could be built for the masses.  This is why we at Buzz Bikes hope to involve wonderful folks, like yourself, in our campaign.
With your contribution, we can take our prototype to the next level and improve upon the current design so that Buzz Bikes can go faster and farther that they ever have before (currently only 4.7 miles a charge) and with free and plentiful sunlight as power!


What We Need & What You Get

The price of a proper lithium ion battery for our project is $1000.  This will give us enough power to make it up steep hills and allow for longevity of the battery as well as quicker charging capacity.  Appropriate solar panels will cost $1000 to supply enough voltage and current to charge the batteries at the right current and voltage.  A new dc motor with charge controller and transfer gears costs around $500 and new bicycle components with a more advance frame design can cost and additional $500.
We love this bike so much, we're willing to give you full plans to build one yourself!  With a contribution of $5 or more, we can show you how to make our original Buzz Bike using techniques and equipment that are economically reasonable and provide great value!  The plans can be downloaded for free after the completion of the campaign and links to vendors and tools are provided in the plans. If we reach our funding goal, an extra secret item will appear in your inbox along with plans to build your own Buzz Bike!
Even if we don't reach our funding goal, those supporters of the Buzz Bikes project will still receive a free download of plans to build a Buzz Bike.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Oceans Eye - Diving for a Difference</h3>
<p>We are Dr Karsten Shein, Peter Quilliam and Neil van Niekerk, founders of Oceans Eye. We have been diving most of our lives and share a love of the marine world and conserving it for generations to come. Karsten is a marine climatologist and Peter is the Director of Operations for a marine research institute. Neil is a lifelong diver and conservationist who began his dive career in 1986. Most recently Neil was the manager at the Southern Cross Club on Little Cayman. Our work bought us together and an idea formed into a global citizen science project. Oceans Eye is a combination of having a high-tech marine laboratory and a precision dive log with you on every dive. Oceans Eye will record important environmental factors throughout your entire dive, gathering information that until now was completely out of reach for scientists around the world. We have taken the static environmental sensor, recording one or two environmental conditions, and created a dynamic sensor, recording many conditions and given it the ability to map any reef or dive site anywhere in the world. Not only that, but the Oceans Eye will also record your dive in 3D - literally mapping your dive for you. All of this information is automatically uploaded to your smart device ready for you to share with friends or to just check out your dive profile yourself. Everything is done without wires or the need to purchase any other hardware.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478968343/ol85n2fkf5gn2jqqobzt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Conditions in the ocean are changing and affecting the places we dive. There are many reasons for these changes. Sediment from dredging, litter discarded into the water, destructive fishing methods. These are all things we can see. We can even do something about some of these things. What about the things we can't ""see"". What about all the places that go un-monitored? Of the roughly 10,000 coral reefs on this planet, we would be lucky to have recorded scientific data on 10% of them. </p>
<p>We can't see changes in pH levels with our eyes, we can't see or even feel the micro changes in temperature along a single reef. We have no way of connecting all of this information to form a comprehensive picture of what is happening.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Oceans Eye is a citizen science project that will make big waves in the way that scientific data is collected around the planet. We want to transform every diver into a science diver, armed with the tools to record data exactly as if they were a marine biologist. The importance of this project is far reaching and could provide answers for the marine research community that singularly would be impossible to generate. </p>
<p>We don't expect you to be able to analyse the data either. We plan to share the data with scientists around the world so that, collectively, we are able to widen our field of vision and paint a much larger picture of global reef health. Not only will we be able to see a global picture unfold, but we will also have the ability to zoom into a reef's micro-climate and discover slight differences over small areas. This could lead to incredible discoveries in conservation and restoration work on damaged reefs. We compared a dive computer and one of our temperature sensors to see the difference between them. This was the result. </p>

<p>It shows that the dive computer was between 2 and 2.5 degrees cooler than our sensor and took around 10 min to stabilize. That makes a huge difference when looking at reef health. We are not trying to compete with the computer market, they are still very important to use. We are delivering a device that is far more accurate and will turn every diver into a proper citizen scientist. </p>
<p>This campaign will provide us with the funds to refine our conceptual prototype device through advanced prototype phase testing and shortly afterwards, mainstream development. And this is where you come in. We need you, the diving community to help us test Oceans Eye and become our very first ambassadors. Your investment will allow us to finish our prototypes and start production. Soon after that you will be among the first to receive an Oceans Eye. We have some great incentives for you and we cant wait for you to join us on our journey. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this project in any way you can, you will be part of an amazing change in the way we see our planet.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk we face if we don't do something now is huge. Coastal communities around the globe depend on healthy reefs for survival.

<p>They worked diligently on the design and sold many but then stopped as the plastic composters were flooding the market and were way cheaper.  Then in 2012 City Farmer in Vancouver asked if we would make them again due to the rat problem in cities.  Fred and Peg’s daughter, Joyce McMenamon, that’s me, took up the challenge.  I am a biologist, retired fish hatchery manager, certified Organic Master Gardener and Master Composter and eager to do what I can to help our world.  We found my Dad’s old drawings and after several dozen tweaks, we feel that we have a game-changing composter. </p>
<h2>How to help</h2>
<p>If you get the big picture and are ready to help make backyard composting achievable, here are some things you can do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support the campaign!  Spend a dollar to say, ‘Yes, backyard composting makes a difference!’</li>
<li>Get a Speedibin and get composting!  We have two options: one model is ready to ship and a second, with a hinged lid, is in prototyping.  Then you can compost your waste to make rich soil.</li>

Mitigating climate change</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Our Mission:</u></strong></p><p>EcoCare’s mission is to rid rural and urban Ghanaian communities of improper solid and organic waste handling – while providing decent job opportunities. We achieve this by:</p><ol>
<li>Educating the public on how to reuse, recycle and reduce the waste they produce  </li>
<li>Promoting segregation of waste at homes, offices, institutions and industries</li>
<li>Recycle solid (plastic, paper, cans, glass and wood) wastes – for reuse</li>
<li>Convert organic (food scraps, spoilt fruits and vegetables and crop peels) into compost for farmers</li>
<li>Promote organic farming and environmental protection against agro-toxins</li>
</ol><p><strong><u>Summary of Challenges Identified to Solve:</u></strong></p><ol>
<li>About 1.35 million tonnes of waste comprising 30-40% organics and 30-35% plastics is generated every day in Brong Ahafo region of Ghana, and destroyed at landfills without recycling</li>
<li>Zoomlion (Ghana’s number one Waste Management Company) alone cannot solve the waste collection challenge for these areas</li>
<li>Indiscriminate disposal of municipal and industrial waste – creates huge waste management challenge for Zoomlion, Environmental Protection Aagency (EPA) and the Town councils of Ahafo</li>
<li>Increased pressure on landfills poses threats on our arable land</li>
<li>Climate change – due to increase Carbon dioxide (CO­­­<sub>2</sub>) emission from burning of wastes</li>
</ol><p><strong><u>The Impacts of EcoCare: R3W Education </u></strong></p><p>EcoCare’s Reuse, Recycle and Reduce Waste (R3W) Education is our maiden project to be initiated in 20 communities to reduce waste. The main activities in this R3W Education will be:</p><ol>
<li>Teach school children basic and effective waste management techniques, <br/>- Such as making paper baskets and art sheets from newspapers; fencing with PET and making backpacks from water sachets etc </li>
<li>Teach individuals and corporate bodies the proper handling of solid and organic waste<br/>- E.g. segregation, reuse of papers and how to reduce paper waste in the office</li>
<li>Collect used plastics, papers, glass and cans from individuals and groups or events which will make our clients earn income, and sever the raw material needs of recycling companies.</li>
<li>Convert organic waste into manure for sale – for sales for farmers to enrich farmlands</li>
</ol><p><strong><u>Our History</u></strong></p><p>Members of EcoCare have disciplines and experiences in Environmental Sciences and Resource Management, business management and social works.</p><p>Team EcoCare won admission into a SAG-SEED Starter social enterprise business development workshop in July 2016 that was funded by UNDP, UNEP and the European Union. During the first phase of the SAG-SEED Starter workshops, EcoCare emerged second out of fourteen teams in a pitch contest – the vision and confidence of the team members was well demonstrated to audience.</p><p>Since then, the team has been teaching people in our communities, basic strategies for plastic, paper and organic waste reuse, and resource management – all aimed at reducing the impact of waste in the environment [<i>see video and photo gallery</i>].</p><p><strong><u>Why we need your support:</u></strong></p><p>We hope to raise <strong>$6250 (GHS 25000)</strong> as capital through partnerships for the establishment of our enterprise.</p><p>This campaign is however, to raise <strong>$500</strong> (<strong>GHS 2000.00)</strong> to cater for logistics and other costs of running the R3W Education program. These include:<br/>a. customised segregation waste bins – for the 20 participating institutions and communities, <br/>b. safety boots, gloves, and nose masks – for demonstration of communal cleaning,<br/>c. flipcharts and exhibits – for eco-friendly waste management demos in English &amp; local languages <br/>d. transportation costs, <br/>e. purchasing of organic and plastic wastes from individual households and groups, <br/>f. radio and print media subscriptions – for public education, <br/>g. PA systems and posters.<br/> </p><p><strong><u>Our Long Term View:</u></strong><br/>EcoCare will become self-sustained after the R3W Education – with revenue generated from sales of recyclable materials and compost, and be able to initiate the rest of its eco-friendly and enterprising waste management projects.</p><p>The overall mid and long term expectations of EcoCare are:</p><p>a. Building a State-of-the-Art Municipal Waste Collection and Recycling Company in Ahafo<br/>b. Providing between 500-1000 jobs to both educated and non-educated youth<br/>c. Converting up to 60% of all our plastic (solid) waste into useful products – e.g. plastic chairs, water tanks, buckets etc<br/>d. Converting up to 80% of all our organic waste into compost and manure<br/>e. Converting up to 90% of all our faecal waste into biogas – reducing dependence on charcoal and firewood.</p><p><strong><u>Some Perks You will Benefit as a Donor:</u></strong><br/>a.

Promoting eco-friendly resource management2. Increasing awareness for recycling and waste management, while3. Mitigating climate change Our Mission:EcoCare’s mission is to rid rural and urban Ghanaian communities of improper solid and organic waste handling – while providing decent job opportunities. We achieve this by:
Educating the public on how to reuse, recycle and reduce the waste they produce  
Promoting segregation of waste at homes, offices, institutions and industries
Recycle solid (plastic, paper, cans, glass and wood) wastes – for reuse
Convert organic (food scraps, spoilt fruits and vegetables and crop peels) into compost for farmers
Promote organic farming and environmental protection against agro-toxins
Summary of Challenges Identified to Solve:
About 1.35 million tonnes of waste comprising 30-40% organics and 30-35% plastics is generated every day in Brong Ahafo region of Ghana, and destroyed at landfills without recycling
Zoomlion (Ghana’s number one Waste Management Company) alone cannot solve the waste collection challenge for these areas
Indiscriminate disposal of municipal and industrial waste – creates huge waste management challenge for Zoomlion, Environmental Protection Aagency (EPA) and the Town councils of Ahafo
Increased pressure on landfills poses threats on our arable land
Climate change – due to increase Carbon dioxide (CO­­­2) emission from burning of wastes
The Impacts of EcoCare: R3W Education EcoCare’s Reuse, Recycle and Reduce Waste (R3W) Education is our maiden project to be initiated in 20 communities to reduce waste. The main activities in this R3W Education will be:
Teach school children basic and effective waste management techniques, - Such as making paper baskets and art sheets from newspapers; fencing with PET and making backpacks from water sachets etc 
Teach individuals and corporate bodies the proper handling of solid and organic waste- E.g. segregation, reuse of papers and how to reduce paper waste in the office
Collect used plastics, papers, glass and cans from individuals and groups or events which will make our clients earn income, and sever the raw material needs of recycling companies.
Convert organic waste into manure for sale – for sales for farmers to enrich farmlands
Our HistoryMembers of EcoCare have disciplines and experiences in Environmental Sciences and Resource Management, business management and social works.Team EcoCare won admission into a SAG-SEED Starter social enterprise business development workshop in July 2016 that was funded by UNDP, UNEP and the European Union. During the first phase of the SAG-SEED Starter workshops, EcoCare emerged second out of fourteen teams in a pitch contest – the vision and confidence of the team members was well demonstrated to audience.Since then, the team has been teaching people in our communities, basic strategies for plastic, paper and organic waste reuse, and resource management – all aimed at reducing the impact of waste in the environment [see video and photo gallery].Why we need your support:We hope to raise $6250 (GHS 25000) as capital through partnerships for the establishment of our enterprise.This campaign is however, to raise $500 (GHS 2000.00) to cater for logistics and other costs of running the R3W Education program. These include:a. customised segregation waste bins – for the 20 participating institutions and communities, b. safety boots, gloves, and nose masks – for demonstration of communal cleaning,c. flipcharts and exhibits – for eco-friendly waste management demos in English & local languages d. transportation costs, e. purchasing of organic and plastic wastes from individual households and groups, f. radio and print media subscriptions – for public education, g. PA systems and posters. Our Long Term View:EcoCare will become self-sustained after the R3W Education – with revenue generated from sales of recyclable materials and compost, and be able to initiate the rest of its eco-friendly and enterprising waste management projects.The overall mid and long term expectations of EcoCare are:a. Building a State-of-the-Art Municipal Waste Collection and Recycling Company in Ahafob. Providing between 500-1000 jobs to both educated and non-educated youthc. Converting up to 60% of all our plastic (solid) waste into useful products – e.g. plastic chairs, water tanks, buckets etcd. Converting up to 80% of all our organic waste into compost and manuree. Converting up to 90% of all our faecal waste into biogas – reducing dependence on charcoal and firewood.Some Perks You will Benefit as a Donor:a. Every donation you make will be acknowledged with a thank-you mail, SMS or possibly a postcard.b. We will give out some handmade recycled products (e.g. paper baskets, bottle chairs, etc)c. We will also give out the “I donated to EcoCare” branded T-shirts major contributorsd. In addition, corporate bodies who donate GHS 500.00 will be acknowledged as sponsors at all R3W Education events, and have their logos on our posters.The EcoCare project has an overall vision of “creating a world free of waste.” The R3W Education is the first programme to kick start this all important agenda to which everyone in this world is connected. Every dollar or cedi you donate today will go a long way to making us reach this goal together.Motto: EcoCare! “Don’t Waste Your Waste”Contact Us:EcoCare R3W Project Team:1.

<h2><strong>About this Project</strong></h2>
<h3>WHAT IS FRACKING</h3>
<p>Hydraulic Fracturing or ""Fracking"" is where a large rotary drill ""rig"" bores vertically downwards for over a kilometer and then angles the ""rig"" to drill horizontally. The horizontal part of the well is several times larger than the vertical and can expand over great distances (several thousand meters).<br/><br/>Once drilled tanker trucks import approximately ninety million liters of water per day (this is the equivalent of 30 Olympic sized swimming pools). This water is mixed with 200,000 litres of chemicals and several tons of sand. The mixture includes over 600 chemicals which destroy biological organisms and change the liquids properties. The water pressure from this slurry fractures the rocks deep underground which allow ""pathways"" for the oil and gas to escape into the well. <br/><br/>Once fracked the gas forces its way up to the surface in anyway it can (usually from the main well head). From the well the gas is stored and any fluid is left in pools to condense and release vapors. </p>

<p>This is a funding page to raise funds to help cover Individual and Research costs covering Air Pollution from fracking and its effects on Environmental Health. Note: that as the Research will pass through the peer reviewed process, it will be completely transparent and can only be a fair and balanced appraisal of Air ""Pollution"" from Fracking. <br/><br/>The research can be broken down into 3 categories:<br/><br/>1.) Much of my research will focus on creating sophisticated and brand new peer reviewed methods for low cost, low power air quality monitoring schemes for fracking wells. <br/><br/>2.) The results of this monitoring will be displayed using complex graphs and atmospheric simulations to develop an unbiased conceptual model showing exposure routes. <br/><br/>3.) The ultimate goal of the research project would be to classify and clarify the impact of air pollution on community health and well-being. </p>
<p>Every Dollar/Pound you spend helps fund this research the more I manage to fund raise the more research I will be able to perform. My aspirations for the project if it did really well would be to work with the global community to analyse air pollution from fracking in Australia through to the United States.

<p>I am Sam Grainger, An Environmental Geologist specializing in Contaminated Land and Environmental Health. I have always had a great love of the outdoors and started collecting minerals and fossils as a young child. Living in the Welsh Valleys, walking was a pursuit I could enjoy often and I began to amass fossils forming my mums rock garden at age 10. As I matured so did my passion, after studying Geology in Sixth Form I went on to read Applied Engineering Geology in the Camborne School of Mines in Cornwall. During my Undergraduate Degree, I won a Scholarship by the Scottish Mining Trust for Academic Excellence. As I went through my course, I began to be interested in contaminated land from industrial and former extractive processes like the Arsenic Calciners which blight the health of Cornish Pasture. </p>
<p>Following graduation, I continued my interests into the site investigation field redeveloping contaminated industrial sites and designing housing estates and large residential and commercial projects for Government and Businesses of all types and sizes. After some time in industry I went back to University to study my Masters in Applied Environmental Geology in Cardiff University. During my masters, I undertook a large project with a range of regulatory bodies evaluating the water quality of a heavily contaminated urban stream through a large Welsh town. This project was voted as a semi-finalist in the National Early Career Geologists Award with the Geological Society of London. During this project I discovered a love for research and led me to the Strathclyde University PhD program. </p>

<p>A major part of this project is to develop new monitoring equipment and monitoring schemes to help detect airborne contamination from Fracking and Diesel Vehicles. This technology will focus upon ultra-low to low cost equipment which could be used and developed into ""Citizen Science"" Air Pollution Surveys. I also intend to see whether drone technology can be utilized in air pollution surveys to understand pollution levels in the low atmosphere. However, there are likely to be limitations of Low Cost equipment compared to more expensive technology. This needs to be borne in mind and accounted for during any pollution survey. This can be done by calibration or through arithmetical corrections or field checking with expensive equipment to ensure an un-bias and fair survey of air quality. </p>

<p><strong>Be the world’s first beekeeper from your couch! Manage and watch your Greek bees work for you and enjoy your high quality, free of chemicals, bee products.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Invest in beekeeping in Greece managing your “own” beehives!</strong></p>
<h3>Our story</h3>
<p>""My Greek bees"" is a family affair. Our engagement with the bee started purely as a hobby. Along the way, our amazement for this wonderful community, evolved into love and passion. So, we searched and found the best spot to install our apiary; a place with a plethora of honey flowers right next to a lush pine forest, with excellent climatic conditions and plenty of running fresh water.</p>
<p>We want to give to our children, to our friends and our clients the best, pure organic products. So we don’t use any toxic chemicals in any stage of the production. We try to face and win any challenge and problem under the principles of organic beekeeping.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have the opportunity to have our own apiary and experience all the stages of the work made in a beehive; from the birth of baby-bees, to adulthood, collection of honey, pollen, propolis and royal jelly.</p>
<p>Why couldn’t everyone had this opportunity? <strong>This thought was the beginning of the birth of ""my Greek bees"" project.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486666527/nflltdswyhahocn17baf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why we need your financial support</h3>
<ul>
<li>To enable as many people as possible in the world, wherever they are, to experience the work of a beekeeper and enjoy the products and services of ""my Greek bees"". Anyone will have the opportunity to become a beekeeper from a distance!</li>
<li>In order for us to expand and have the opportunity to buy more beehives, equip our apiary lab, and get a small truck to carry the beehives wherever nature commands.  </li>
<li>To build a usable web site through which you will be able to enjoy many additional services and manage your hive.</li>
<li>To build an e-shop so that everyone can buy and enjoy our quality organic bee products.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have estimated that we need an initial investment of 40.000 € in order to cover the above goals and necessary managerial expenses.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486751987/d9ro0mu6pyfflxsfsx5y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>You get to be a beekeeper from your couch</h3>
<ul>
<li>You choose one, two or as many as you like, from the available beehives in our apiary for a specific period of time.</li>
<li>You will track your swarm from winter to the birth of the Queen in spring, the multiplication of the colony, the first flowering of nature which will lead to the first harvest of the year. You will see, step by step, how the bees put the honey in the hive cells, how they seal it with pure beeswax, and how we remove this wax when the honey is mature and ready for harvest in our laboratory. You will see the honey flowing out of the honey extractor and put in containers with your name, which you will receive in the next few days.</li>
<li>You and your loved ones will enjoy one of the greatest miracles of Greek nature, honey, as well as pollen and propolis, free from any kind of drugs and chemicals, experiencing the whole process of production at the same time. All this from your own beehives.</li>
<li>You get your name written on the hive (or hives)</li>
<li>In the next few days after you have rented your hives, you will receive your first video presentation of your hive and bee population.</li>
<li>Later, you will receive a new video every time we will be handling the hive and do inspections. Since there is a living organism in the hive, inspections will depend on many factors such as weather conditions for instance. So, we cannot prejudge how many inspections will be made and when. But usually during the months April through October there are usually 3 or 4 inspections per month.</li>
<li>For every inspection you will receive a video with a description, so that you know everything taking place in your hive.</li>
<li>You will see the Queen, workers, drones, but also babies just born! You will see your bees carrying freshly collected pollen that you will enjoy in a few days.</li>
<li>You will see where your bees store your honey! Greek honey, the most important nutritional value worldwide, as well as propolis, which is a most powerful antimicrobial and bactericide product.</li>
<li>You will get to know the area where the colonies are located and collect nectar, pollen, propolis and also water from the creek adjacent to our apiary. It is an area rich in flowers, with willow trees, Ivy, sunflowers, oregano, corn but also an entire pine forest 200 meters away, giving us the well-known famous Greek pine honey.</li>
<li>In addition to pine and flower honey you can get other flavors as well such as tasty organic chestnut honey, heather honey, oak honey, each one with its own distinct flavor and properties. That's why we transfer some of our colonies at the appropriate time of year to different locations.<u> </u>
</li>
<li>
<strong>You will be the first person in the world to gain the unique experience and ability, to know where your bees live, where they collect honey from and everything that happens inside the hive.</strong> And of course you'll enjoy your pure organic products:<ul>
<li>Pure Organic honey</li>
<li>Fresh colorful Pollen</li>
<li>Propolis tincture for antimicrobial use</li>
<li>Beeswax salve of your choice</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In a quantity that depends on the rental period of your beehive.</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Do you feel like getting a profit out of this?</strong> You have the unique opportunity to buy large quantities of the products in wholesale prices. Show people your photos and videos of your Greek bees, and sell them your Greek Organic, tasty products. <strong>Be a beekeeper for real!</strong></p></li></ul>

<h3>Take the opportunity and choose one of our Perks now!</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><h3>FAQ</h3><ul><li><i>Does the bee hive really belong to me? Will I be able to get it or to do whatever I want with it? Can I really get it somehow?</i></li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">No, the beehive that you rent, belongs to “my Greek bees”. However you will have the opportunity once the rental period finished, to get the beehive that hosted the bees that have worked for you at a cost 60 € plus shipping and to obtain a unique keepsake.</p><ul><li><i>How will I be informed about my beehives' progress?</i></li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We will send you videos as well as photos plus reports about the inspections of your beehives that will take place and the natural landscape of the area around the location of your bees. You'll see how life evolves inside the hive, storing honey, pollen, propolis, the birth of the queen, the process of acquiring a new queen and so much more. You will see the whole honey extraction process and packaging and storage, once we get the honeycombs.

Manage and watch your Greek bees work for you and enjoy your high quality, free of chemicals, bee products.
Invest in beekeeping in Greece managing your “own” beehives!
Our story
""My Greek bees"" is a family affair. Our engagement with the bee started purely as a hobby. Along the way, our amazement for this wonderful community, evolved into love and passion. So, we searched and found the best spot to install our apiary; a place with a plethora of honey flowers right next to a lush pine forest, with excellent climatic conditions and plenty of running fresh water.
We want to give to our children, to our friends and our clients the best, pure organic products. So we don’t use any toxic chemicals in any stage of the production. We try to face and win any challenge and problem under the principles of organic beekeeping.
We are fortunate to have the opportunity to have our own apiary and experience all the stages of the work made in a beehive; from the birth of baby-bees, to adulthood, collection of honey, pollen, propolis and royal jelly.
Why couldn’t everyone had this opportunity? This thought was the beginning of the birth of ""my Greek bees"" project.

Why we need your financial support

To enable as many people as possible in the world, wherever they are, to experience the work of a beekeeper and enjoy the products and services of ""my Greek bees"". Anyone will have the opportunity to become a beekeeper from a distance!
In order for us to expand and have the opportunity to buy more beehives, equip our apiary lab, and get a small truck to carry the beehives wherever nature commands.  
To build a usable web site through which you will be able to enjoy many additional services and manage your hive.
To build an e-shop so that everyone can buy and enjoy our quality organic bee products.

We have estimated that we need an initial investment of 40.000 € in order to cover the above goals and necessary managerial expenses.

You get to be a beekeeper from your couch

You choose one, two or as many as you like, from the available beehives in our apiary for a specific period of time.
You will track your swarm from winter to the birth of the Queen in spring, the multiplication of the colony, the first flowering of nature which will lead to the first harvest of the year. You will see, step by step, how the bees put the honey in the hive cells, how they seal it with pure beeswax, and how we remove this wax when the honey is mature and ready for harvest in our laboratory. You will see the honey flowing out of the honey extractor and put in containers with your name, which you will receive in the next few days.
You and your loved ones will enjoy one of the greatest miracles of Greek nature, honey, as well as pollen and propolis, free from any kind of drugs and chemicals, experiencing the whole process of production at the same time. All this from your own beehives.
You get your name written on the hive (or hives)
In the next few days after you have rented your hives, you will receive your first video presentation of your hive and bee population.
Later, you will receive a new video every time we will be handling the hive and do inspections. Since there is a living organism in the hive, inspections will depend on many factors such as weather conditions for instance. So, we cannot prejudge how many inspections will be made and when. But usually during the months April through October there are usually 3 or 4 inspections per month.
For every inspection you will receive a video with a description, so that you know everything taking place in your hive.
You will see the Queen, workers, drones, but also babies just born! You will see your bees carrying freshly collected pollen that you will enjoy in a few days.
You will see where your bees store your honey! Greek honey, the most important nutritional value worldwide, as well as propolis, which is a most powerful antimicrobial and bactericide product.
You will get to know the area where the colonies are located and collect nectar, pollen, propolis and also water from the creek adjacent to our apiary. It is an area rich in flowers, with willow trees, Ivy, sunflowers, oregano, corn but also an entire pine forest 200 meters away, giving us the well-known famous Greek pine honey.
In addition to pine and flower honey you can get other flavors as well such as tasty organic chestnut honey, heather honey, oak honey, each one with its own distinct flavor and properties. That's why we transfer some of our colonies at the appropriate time of year to different locations. 


You will be the first person in the world to gain the unique experience and ability, to know where your bees live, where they collect honey from and everything that happens inside the hive. And of course you'll enjoy your pure organic products:
Pure Organic honey
Fresh colorful Pollen
Propolis tincture for antimicrobial use
Beeswax salve of your choice



In a quantity that depends on the rental period of your beehive.
Do you feel like getting a profit out of this? You have the unique opportunity to buy large quantities of the products in wholesale prices. Show people your photos and videos of your Greek bees, and sell them your Greek Organic, tasty products. Be a beekeeper for real!

 
Take the opportunity and choose one of our Perks now!
 
FAQDoes the bee hive really belong to me? Will I be able to get it or to do whatever I want with it? Can I really get it somehow?No, the beehive that you rent, belongs to “my Greek bees”. However you will have the opportunity once the rental period finished, to get the beehive that hosted the bees that have worked for you at a cost 60 € plus shipping and to obtain a unique keepsake.How will I be informed about my beehives' progress?We will send you videos as well as photos plus reports about the inspections of your beehives that will take place and the natural landscape of the area around the location of your bees. You'll see how life evolves inside the hive, storing honey, pollen, propolis, the birth of the queen, the process of acquiring a new queen and so much more. You will see the whole honey extraction process and packaging and storage, once we get the honeycombs. Furthermore, you will probably see us loading some beehives of our apiary, including yours,  to the truck and moving them into Chestnut tree forest, or Oak tree forest, or anywhere else nature commands.Can I stop the rental program whenever I want?No. You can just refrain from renewing your subscription for the next period if you wish.Can I paint my hive a specific color or decorate it in any way?We normally put your name on your beehive. But if you wish, with an extra charge of 30 €, we can  paint your beehive in the colors you want, or write something you want on it (your child's name or something that you wish).",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our philosophy and approach is that in order to preserve forest, we cannot fully separate people from it, so our work focuses on the the surrounding communities &amp; cultural conservation whilst promoting sustainable forest use, especially traditional uses and those which preserve biodiversity. We also believe forests should be well-stewarded and protected, particularly this rainforest that we consider our home.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>The intention of our campaign is to protect the at-risk forest remaining and lessen the risk of our neighbor’s clear-cutting from encroaching any further.

<p>Clear-cutting in the Amazon is happening on a huge scale. Across our region, and in the neighboring Amazonian territories and countries, forest loss is occurring just like that which we are facing... 50 hectares lost one year, 50 hectares lost the next. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3><strong>… about our neighbor the cattle-rancher. </strong></h3>
<p>The cattle-ranching operation is neighboring to our land at Novalis. A lot of forest loss in the Amazon is caused by families looking for livelihood. However, we know this is not the case here. Our neighbor in fact has 600 heads of cattle, 300 heads of sheep, and 200 heads of goat, as well as a fish farm and is the owner of two Brazil nut concessions. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unfortunately he is becoming a negative social reference for our other neighbors and native communities around us; seeing this activity as an example of income security but at the expense of the forest's ecosystem. There are other favorable techniques around cattle raising that we suggested to him but he simply was not in favor. Though we keep up the conversation, this type of campaign of change requires time and shifts in societal views. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Then we supported <i>denuncias</i> (legal denunciations) against his illegal practices aiming to slow him down and get him to see that his practices are more damaging than they are wise. Such unwise practices included logging of a creek, and burning legally protected Brazil nut trees. He also infiltrated 15,000 square meters of our land with more cut and burn.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He continues to want more land but, as we explain below, it's not at all a sustainable venture given that Amazonian soil does not support long-term cattle farming. With cattle ranching, usually the land is spent within 6-10 years after the clearing is made. This means a longer-term cattle venture in the Amazon will almost always require more land. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Thus, the reality of cattle ranching in the Amazon is that it:</strong></p>
<p>1) deforests the Amazon;</p>
<p>2) kills the soil &amp; makes barren the once thriving landscape;</p>
<p>3) discards the land after a period of time &amp; requires more;</p>
<p>We want to prevent these kinds of outcomes in the neighboring forests where we work.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Science of Cattle Ranching in the Amazon</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>BIODIVERSITY &amp; AMAZONIAN CLEAR-CUTTING</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Amazon Rainforest is biologically diverse, beyond what most people realize. And in the world’s present ecological crisis, there is an absolute need for people to realize that our future depends on these forests.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is estimated that over 10% of vertebrate species (i.e., animals) are Amazonian - so there are many species of fish, bird, and mammals. There countless species of insects and fungi accompanied by over 5,400 plant species in the Peruvian Amazon, 2,700 of which are known tree species. Many of these species, such as the amazing and ancient Brazil nut tree, depend on highly specialized ecological relationships that are vulnerable to changes in forest cover, and species loss. We want to prevent major forest loss. And a 200 hectare clear-cut, that is at risk of growing by 50 to 100 hectares more this year is exactly this kind of loss.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p><strong>AMAZONIAN SOIL ECOLOGY:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rainforest soils are some of the least fertile on the planet. The topsoil organic layer in rainforests is thin, and is sustained by biomass. Biomass is the total mass of organisms in an area, such as trees, insects, bacteria, animals, fungi and herbaceous plants. Biomass is very high in rainforests and is the only reason rainforests have organic topsoil at all. When an organism dies it decomposes very quickly in the humidity becoming food for other organisms with a rapid release of minerals and nutrients. For this reason, organic top soil is thin, as this nutrition is utilized quickly by other living things.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The type of soil in rainforests is referred to as oxisols. Oxisols are depleted in minerals, partly because of the decomposition rate of organic material and also because of the amount of rainfall that leaches most minerals out of the system. For this reasons the soil that Amazonian cattle ranchers aim raise livestock on is poor. Fertile cattle country, this is not! The first year after a rancher clears the forest, and then burns it, there is good nutrition in the cow pasture of tropical grasses which rapidly grow back. But within years of repeating this cycle on the same plot of land, the topsoil layer becomes completely depleted, and there becomes poor pasture for the cows. Soon the farmer abandons the plot. Biodiversity is lost. Topsoil is adversely affected. And the mature forest disappears.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>In most cases, centuries of forest-cover has been lost for just a decade of farming</strong>.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553137501/obkhbjp3pwyhffxf8t2x.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i><i>Mariluz collects Brazil nuts in her forest. To produce, Brazil nut trees depend on complex relationships between pollinators, pollinator habitat, and a rodent that can break open the hardshell. These types of relationships are only possible in mature, intact forest. </i></i><i><i>(image Cassandra Caroline)</i></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p><strong>SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because for millions of people who live in the Amazon clear-cut farming is a major mainstay for both daily income and daily meals, it's also one of the major drivers of forest loss in Amazonian regions. Over 80% of forest loss in the Amazon is due to ranching. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>How do we know? </strong>Science. The research is clear, showing what many people already suspected, for example that in the Brazilian Amazon key drivers of deforestation are pasture, cropland, and land speculation. Here in the province where we live in Peru we also have mining, illegal roads, illegal logging and mono-crops like palm oil and papaya to blame.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>–––</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our Indiegogo campaign is to legally purchase and title as much land around the cattle field as possible. We aim to create a green corridor and green barrier around the cattle clear-cut. We have already staked claim on the northern and western forests through government leased Brazil nut concessions, which legally protect the areas the trees inhabit, and now we are moving to protect the southern border and beyond. <strong>Join us and become a Patron of the Forest or purchase your own plot of land in the Las Piedras Rainforest! </strong></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How we are taking a stand!</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>–––</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As an organization deeply committed to both forest conservation and humans living here, we do stand for our neighbors having income. There are different ways to accomplish that though, and clear-cut cattle farming in the Amazon is an unsustainable venture, especially the way that we are seeing it done now.</p>
<p><strong>Our position is as follows:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1) We are always actively exploring new ways to communicate with our neighbors, which involve efforts of education, peace-keeping, and well-directed communication as tools to help see the view that the forest is the most important resource on this planet.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2) We share our empirical discoveries &amp; perspectives through social media &amp; the internet, so that others can connect to this globally affected movement of deforestation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3) We continuously engage with our neighboring communities who are also experiencing the effects of logging, clear-cuts, and mining. We offer support through alliance, sustainable system introduction, and collaboration in developing new economical activities that steer them away from deforestation. We also help to connect brazil nut farmers to direct channels of distribution giving them a more favorable return on investment. </p>

<p><strong>AMAZON FOREST FACTS:</strong></p>
<p><i>•The Amazon rainforest spans 670 million hectares</i></p>
<p><i>•Between 90-140 billion metric tons of carbon is stored in the Amazon forests</i></p>
<p><i>•34 million people live in the Amazon and depend on its resources</i></p>
<p><i>•Forest losses in the Amazon biome averaged 1.4 million hectares per year between 2001 and 2012, resulting in a total loss of 17.7 million hectares, mostly in Brazil, Peru and Bolivia</i></p>
<p><i>•If current trends continue, deforestation could double to 48 million hectares between 2010 and 2030, meaning that more than a quarter of the Amazon biome would be without trees.</i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>So, how do we rage against the clear-cut machine?</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>–––</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All of us have a part to play, that is for certain. We are all the witness of climate change today and one of the principle causing factors is the scale of deforestation across the globe especially here in the Amazon. The rate of ecological problems as well as socio-economic factors; like poverty and basic lack of development in Amazonian regions, as well as the widespread violence against environmental activists across the world are human-centered issues that implore us to speak out. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">No one has the answers to these issues alone. Collective initiatives will allow us to introduce creative solutions around what otherwise will bring us closer to a state of global emergency.<br/>Each of us has a voice. Each of us can do our part. Each of us must make a commitment. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The work ahead for humanity is immense. And for us, it starts with what is in our hands, right here in the Amazon!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>–––</strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>You can support our effort to preserve forest quality, and create a green corridor; a green border around our cattle farming neighbor, for the health of this thriving ecosystem.</strong></h3>

<p>We can see both major deforestation happening here around us. But the forest here in our area, still prominent for it's natural beauty and ecological intactness also gives us a lot of reason to act. Below are three maps, sourced with data from Global Forest Watch (link below).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This first map, with white and red, highlights deforestation between the years of 2001 and 2017. The forest we steward at Novalis is indicated by the area in and around the circle. Notice the deforestation at the cattle field (indicated by an arrow). </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>It is a green corridor leading from the intact forest, and it is directly in our hands to protect it.</strong> Wildlife biologists have confirmed to us our sightings of Spider monkeys, jaguars, and tapir.

<h3><strong>WHAT THIS FOREST NEEDS + HOW YOU CAN PARTICIPATE!</strong></h3>
<p>Now we break it down for you in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Novalis is aiming to legally protect all forest bordering the aforementioned clear-cut by purchasing it from other neighbors who want to sell. There are already works in progress, and we have already made financial and legal moves to secure much of the neighboring land. But we need more help.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>We are offering land title in the Peruvian Amazon!</strong> You have the unique opportunity to support this initiative, and the option to receive legal title to land. We are selling forest lots between 300m2 (0.075 acres) and 600m2 (0.15 acres) that extend from the riverfront and further into the forest. These lots will be titled to your name which will require that you visit us in Peru to file the paperwork. Here you can experience these forests firsthand.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<strong>You can also donate as ""Patron of the Forest""</strong>, where your financial contribution will aid us in maintaining our preservation initiatives.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>By selling and supporting these smaller pieces of land we will be fundraising to preserve another 30-100 hectares immediately this year.</strong></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Ideally we can begin negotiations to extend our reach beyond this, and continue forming a protected barrier and green-belt that is linking the healthy intact forests located further from the river with the river itself: thus preventing the expansion of the cattle pasture, and loss of habitat.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">All of the money we raise will be allocated to meet our goal. Any additional funds will go to our conservation and cultural projects. We summarize them below.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3><strong>What has Novalis accomplished to become a trustworthy organization worthy of your donations?</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Our projects of conservation extend into the surrounding territories and indigenous communities of the Amahuaca, Yine, Ese Eja &amp; Quichua cultures, and into the Amazon forest. People from all over the world come to our center to engage in the diversity of programming and outreach that we provide here in the Peruvian Amazon. </p>

<h2><strong>Our Future Initiatives and Some Final Words</strong></h2>
<p>Novalis is a platform where people can come to experience and learn from the repository of knowledge that is the Amazon. It is also an opportunity for guests, researchers, creatives, and teachers to immerse into the diversity of the work that we as an organization take part in alongside our indigenous relations and the rainforest ecosystem, either as short term residents or visitors.</p>
<p>In 2019 we have received a number of volunteers and guests wanting to join our efforts. To meet the growing needs of our center, we are building more communal housing to continue hosting more visitors, volunteers and researchers. And will continue to expand our programming.</p>
<p>We are deepening our relationships with individual indigenous members by providing support, guidance and collaborative management to  implement sustainable solutions to the challenges they face from activities such as illegal mining, to having viable social enterprises, to cultural preservation, creative projects, and education. </p>
<p>We are also working towards projects in the botanical world, such as creating a living library for education on Amazonian Plants, planting for the proliferation of valuable medicinal plants, and hosting botanical experts that see Novalis as a research platform.</p>

WE ARE NOVALIS
 
Novalis is a Peruvian-based association composed of members from all over the world. We are stewards and protectors of over 2,000 hectares of Amazonian rainforest. We are active in the harvest of Brazil nuts and the conservation of the ecologically valuable forests where we live in the Las Piedras region of the South-Eastern Peruvian Amazon.
Novalis serves as a center for cultural preservation and rainforest conservation. Our philosophy and approach is that in order to preserve forest, we cannot fully separate people from it, so our work focuses on the the surrounding communities & cultural conservation whilst promoting sustainable forest use, especially traditional uses and those which preserve biodiversity. We also believe forests should be well-stewarded and protected, particularly this rainforest that we consider our home.
 
WHAT WE DO
 
Novalis is a platform for botanical explorations, anthropological research, indigenous collaborations and human connection to Nature through interactive retreats and programs.
Each year since 2011, we have been making interventions to protect our forest, collaborating with indigenous people in neighboring communities, and also with other like-minded individuals and organizations. We take pride in our work, and so far the monies we receive from our activities go directly back into keeping Novalis up and running.
 
__________________________________________________________________________________
 
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS

… here in the amazon, one of our neighbors is a clearcut cattle-rancher. 
 
Everyday, we walk the 200 hectare (~500 acres) plot he has clear-cut in the last 8 years to arrive to our protected forest 3.5km from the river, where we live.  We have watched him cut down 50 hectares each year during the last 4 years, and he has plans to keep going. 
The intention of our campaign is to protect the at-risk forest remaining and lessen the risk of our neighbor’s clear-cutting from encroaching any further. We offer you the incentive to protect these forests by way of purchasing land with title right here in the Peruvian Amazon. Through your financial support we can move forward with purchasing the land around his operation to realize these goals. See our PERKS for further details.
Clear-cutting in the Amazon is happening on a huge scale. Across our region, and in the neighboring Amazonian territories and countries, forest loss is occurring just like that which we are facing... 50 hectares lost one year, 50 hectares lost the next. 
 
This is the way the forest disappears, all across the Amazon: One hectare at a time.
This clear-cut is the classic story about deforestation in the Amazon. The one you have probably read about in magazines, or seen on the TV or the internet.  This above photo shows cleared land beside a part of the forest we are trying to protect. (image: drone capture Julio Araujo)

THE STORY

Cattle from one of our other neighbours along the river Las Piedras. (image: Tui Anandi)
 
… about our neighbor the cattle-rancher. 
The cattle-ranching operation is neighboring to our land at Novalis. A lot of forest loss in the Amazon is caused by families looking for livelihood. However, we know this is not the case here. Our neighbor in fact has 600 heads of cattle, 300 heads of sheep, and 200 heads of goat, as well as a fish farm and is the owner of two Brazil nut concessions. 
Unfortunately he is becoming a negative social reference for our other neighbors and native communities around us; seeing this activity as an example of income security but at the expense of the forest's ecosystem. There are other favorable techniques around cattle raising that we suggested to him but he simply was not in favor. Though we keep up the conversation, this type of campaign of change requires time and shifts in societal views. 
Then we supported denuncias (legal denunciations) against his illegal practices aiming to slow him down and get him to see that his practices are more damaging than they are wise. Such unwise practices included logging of a creek, and burning legally protected Brazil nut trees. He also infiltrated 15,000 square meters of our land with more cut and burn.
He continues to want more land but, as we explain below, it's not at all a sustainable venture given that Amazonian soil does not support long-term cattle farming. With cattle ranching, usually the land is spent within 6-10 years after the clearing is made. This means a longer-term cattle venture in the Amazon will almost always require more land. 
Thus, the reality of cattle ranching in the Amazon is that it:
1) deforests the Amazon;
2) kills the soil & makes barren the once thriving landscape;
3) discards the land after a period of time & requires more;
We want to prevent these kinds of outcomes in the neighboring forests where we work.

The Science of Cattle Ranching in the Amazon
BIODIVERSITY & AMAZONIAN CLEAR-CUTTING
The Amazon Rainforest is biologically diverse, beyond what most people realize. And in the world’s present ecological crisis, there is an absolute need for people to realize that our future depends on these forests.
It is estimated that over 10% of vertebrate species (i.e., animals) are Amazonian - so there are many species of fish, bird, and mammals. There countless species of insects and fungi accompanied by over 5,400 plant species in the Peruvian Amazon, 2,700 of which are known tree species. Many of these species, such as the amazing and ancient Brazil nut tree, depend on highly specialized ecological relationships that are vulnerable to changes in forest cover, and species loss. We want to prevent major forest loss. And a 200 hectare clear-cut, that is at risk of growing by 50 to 100 hectares more this year is exactly this kind of loss.
 
AMAZONIAN SOIL ECOLOGY:
Rainforest soils are some of the least fertile on the planet. The topsoil organic layer in rainforests is thin, and is sustained by biomass. Biomass is the total mass of organisms in an area, such as trees, insects, bacteria, animals, fungi and herbaceous plants. Biomass is very high in rainforests and is the only reason rainforests have organic topsoil at all. When an organism dies it decomposes very quickly in the humidity becoming food for other organisms with a rapid release of minerals and nutrients. For this reason, organic top soil is thin, as this nutrition is utilized quickly by other living things.
The type of soil in rainforests is referred to as oxisols. Oxisols are depleted in minerals, partly because of the decomposition rate of organic material and also because of the amount of rainfall that leaches most minerals out of the system. For this reasons the soil that Amazonian cattle ranchers aim raise livestock on is poor. Fertile cattle country, this is not! The first year after a rancher clears the forest, and then burns it, there is good nutrition in the cow pasture of tropical grasses which rapidly grow back. But within years of repeating this cycle on the same plot of land, the topsoil layer becomes completely depleted, and there becomes poor pasture for the cows. Soon the farmer abandons the plot. Biodiversity is lost. Topsoil is adversely affected. And the mature forest disappears.

In most cases, centuries of forest-cover has been lost for just a decade of farming.

SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Because for millions of people who live in the Amazon clear-cut farming is a major mainstay for both daily income and daily meals, it's also one of the major drivers of forest loss in Amazonian regions. Over 80% of forest loss in the Amazon is due to ranching. 
How do we know? Science. The research is clear, showing what many people already suspected, for example that in the Brazilian Amazon key drivers of deforestation are pasture, cropland, and land speculation. Here in the province where we live in Peru we also have mining, illegal roads, illegal logging and mono-crops like palm oil and papaya to blame.
 


These above photos show the extent of clear-cutting happening between 2004 and 2018 on our neighbor's cattle ranch. Each photo utilizes satellite imagery. What will 2019 hold? We are protecting almost all boundaries, except to the south, which are lands owned by other people. This is vulnerable land, as usually it will be sold to the highest bidder.

What will we do now? 
–––
Our Indiegogo campaign is to legally purchase and title as much land around the cattle field as possible. We aim to create a green corridor and green barrier around the cattle clear-cut. We have already staked claim on the northern and western forests through government leased Brazil nut concessions, which legally protect the areas the trees inhabit, and now we are moving to protect the southern border and beyond. Join us and become a Patron of the Forest or purchase your own plot of land in the Las Piedras Rainforest! 
 
How we are taking a stand!
–––
As an organization deeply committed to both forest conservation and humans living here, we do stand for our neighbors having income. There are different ways to accomplish that though, and clear-cut cattle farming in the Amazon is an unsustainable venture, especially the way that we are seeing it done now.
Our position is as follows:
1) We are always actively exploring new ways to communicate with our neighbors, which involve efforts of education, peace-keeping, and well-directed communication as tools to help see the view that the forest is the most important resource on this planet.
2) We share our empirical discoveries & perspectives through social media & the internet, so that others can connect to this globally affected movement of deforestation.
3) We continuously engage with our neighboring communities who are also experiencing the effects of logging, clear-cuts, and mining. We offer support through alliance, sustainable system introduction, and collaboration in developing new economical activities that steer them away from deforestation. We also help to connect brazil nut farmers to direct channels of distribution giving them a more favorable return on investment.

THE FACTS ARE IN!
...humans have to keep protecting primary forests, and doing all we can to preserve forest cover and quality, reclaim fragmented and degraded forests, and to keep the Amazon; the lungs of the planet, GREEN. 
 
AMAZON FOREST FACTS:
•The Amazon rainforest spans 670 million hectares
•Between 90-140 billion metric tons of carbon is stored in the Amazon forests
•34 million people live in the Amazon and depend on its resources
•Forest losses in the Amazon biome averaged 1.4 million hectares per year between 2001 and 2012, resulting in a total loss of 17.7 million hectares, mostly in Brazil, Peru and Bolivia
•If current trends continue, deforestation could double to 48 million hectares between 2010 and 2030, meaning that more than a quarter of the Amazon biome would be without trees.
 
We can say with a lot of confidence that climate science agrees, ecological science agrees, and forest-based indigenous societies agree that clear-cutting the rainforest in the Amazon is for sure something to be avoided if not stopped altogether.

So, how do we rage against the clear-cut machine?
–––
All of us have a part to play, that is for certain. We are all the witness of climate change today and one of the principle causing factors is the scale of deforestation across the globe especially here in the Amazon. The rate of ecological problems as well as socio-economic factors; like poverty and basic lack of development in Amazonian regions, as well as the widespread violence against environmental activists across the world are human-centered issues that implore us to speak out. 
No one has the answers to these issues alone. Collective initiatives will allow us to introduce creative solutions around what otherwise will bring us closer to a state of global emergency.Each of us has a voice. Each of us can do our part. Each of us must make a commitment. 
The work ahead for humanity is immense. And for us, it starts with what is in our hands, right here in the Amazon!
–––
You can support our effort to preserve forest quality, and create a green corridor; a green border around our cattle farming neighbor, for the health of this thriving ecosystem.

20% of the world's oxygen is produced in the Amazon
We can see both major deforestation happening here around us. But the forest here in our area, still prominent for it's natural beauty and ecological intactness also gives us a lot of reason to act. Below are three maps, sourced with data from Global Forest Watch (link below).
This first map, with white and red, highlights deforestation between the years of 2001 and 2017. The forest we steward at Novalis is indicated by the area in and around the circle. Notice the deforestation at the cattle field (indicated by an arrow). 
 
DEFORESTATION BETWEEN 2001-2017

 
 
INTACT FORESTS ARE HEALTHIER
This second map shows intact forest cover showing Novalis' jungle base-camp depicted as a black star. Where forest is intact, the forest is more able to adjust to change, and there is more unfragmented habitat for species of animals, insects, and plants.
 
 
 
THE AREA WE INTEND TO PROTECT
This third map is the area we intend to protect (a white box roughly drawn below the cattle field). This map also highlights a layer showing biomass loss, potentially indicating the spent nature of the soil. We know this area is to be an important protection area for its connection to the river.
It is a green corridor leading from the intact forest, and it is directly in our hands to protect it. Wildlife biologists have confirmed to us our sightings of Spider monkeys, jaguars, and tapir. We often see jaguar and puma tracks in the sand. The area also contains several ancient Brazil nut trees (Bertholletia excelsa), as well as ecologically important aguaje (Mauritia flexuosa) swamp.

WHAT THIS FOREST NEEDS + HOW YOU CAN PARTICIPATE!
Now we break it down for you in more detail:

Novalis is aiming to legally protect all forest bordering the aforementioned clear-cut by purchasing it from other neighbors who want to sell. There are already works in progress, and we have already made financial and legal moves to secure much of the neighboring land. But we need more help.

We are offering land title in the Peruvian Amazon! You have the unique opportunity to support this initiative, and the option to receive legal title to land. We are selling forest lots between 300m2 (0.075 acres) and 600m2 (0.15 acres) that extend from the riverfront and further into the forest. These lots will be titled to your name which will require that you visit us in Peru to file the paperwork. Here you can experience these forests firsthand.

You can also donate as ""Patron of the Forest"", where your financial contribution will aid us in maintaining our preservation initiatives.
By selling and supporting these smaller pieces of land we will be fundraising to preserve another 30-100 hectares immediately this year.
Ideally we can begin negotiations to extend our reach beyond this, and continue forming a protected barrier and green-belt that is linking the healthy intact forests located further from the river with the river itself: thus preventing the expansion of the cattle pasture, and loss of habitat.
All of the money we raise will be allocated to meet our goal. Any additional funds will go to our conservation and cultural projects. We summarize them below.

 
What has Novalis accomplished to become a trustworthy organization worthy of your donations?
Our projects of conservation extend into the surrounding territories and indigenous communities of the Amahuaca, Yine, Ese Eja & Quichua cultures, and into the Amazon forest. People from all over the world come to our center to engage in the diversity of programming and outreach that we provide here in the Peruvian Amazon.

Our Future Initiatives and Some Final Words
Novalis is a platform where people can come to experience and learn from the repository of knowledge that is the Amazon. It is also an opportunity for guests, researchers, creatives, and teachers to immerse into the diversity of the work that we as an organization take part in alongside our indigenous relations and the rainforest ecosystem, either as short term residents or visitors.
In 2019 we have received a number of volunteers and guests wanting to join our efforts. To meet the growing needs of our center, we are building more communal housing to continue hosting more visitors, volunteers and researchers. And will continue to expand our programming.
We are deepening our relationships with individual indigenous members by providing support, guidance and collaborative management to  implement sustainable solutions to the challenges they face from activities such as illegal mining, to having viable social enterprises, to cultural preservation, creative projects, and education. 
We are also working towards projects in the botanical world, such as creating a living library for education on Amazonian Plants, planting for the proliferation of valuable medicinal plants, and hosting botanical experts that see Novalis as a research platform.

</h4>
<div>
<b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b><p>The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that education facilities across the U.S. spend over $8 Billion in energy costs a year! Coming in as the 2nd largest budget cost for schools behind personnel. According to the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, schools could save 25% of these costs by being smart about energy. Through energy improvements alone, our nations schools have the potential to save $2 billion each year and, at the same time, create better learning environments. Thats the equivalent to the amount of nearly 40 million new textbooks!</p>
<p>Solar energy systems generate clean, emission-free electricity using the power of the sun. They are virtually maintenance free and have a typical life span of 30 years. By installing solar energy systems onto school roofs, school districts can see dramatic energy cost savings, all while greatly reduce their carbon footprint and joining the fight against climate change and the harmful pollution of our environment.</p>

</div></div>","Due to extensive budget
cuts across the United States thousands of teachers have lost their jobs, hundreds of schools have closed, and critical educational programs have been eliminated. 

                                            

Help us alleviate these budget cuts by bringing solar energy projects to schools in your community.



""Analyses
from independent academic experts confirm what we know from common-sense: that
laying off teachers, increasing class sizes, eliminating critical programs,
shortening the school week or shortening the school year all mean that our
students receive less attention and fewer chances to achieve in their
education"" -Executive Office of The President, White House Press Release



What is Brighter
Classrooms?

A program founded by SolBid, a solar energy services company who has vowed to put a portion of their revenues from every solar energy system they sell for the life of the company, towards the donation of solar onto school roofs.
The program's goal is to:

Reduce school energy costs, allowing for school budget dollars to be reallocated towards providing our children of today and future leaders of tomorrow with a better education.

Use local solar installers for the installation of these solar systems, generating a positive impact on the economy in the schools local community.


Increase the deployment of clean energy production and cutting back our dependency on fossil fuel energy sources. In return, reducing the amount of toxic carbon dioxide and mercury emissions currently being released into our environment.


Educate our children on the economic and environmental benefits of solar energy and the positive impact it will have on our future.


Raise awareness and take action on the existing epidemic regarding our children's education and well-being that is currently being threatened.         

*Visit the Brighter Classrooms website for more details.           




So how can Solar Energy Help?


The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that education facilities across the U.S. spend over $8 Billion in energy costs a year! Coming in as the 2nd largest budget cost for schools behind personnel. According to the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, schools could save 25% of these costs by being smart about energy. Through energy improvements alone, our nations schools have the potential to save $2 billion each year and, at the same time, create better learning environments. Thats the equivalent to the amount of nearly 40 million new textbooks!
Solar energy systems generate clean, emission-free electricity using the power of the sun. They are virtually maintenance free and have a typical life span of 30 years. By installing solar energy systems onto school roofs, school districts can see dramatic energy cost savings, all while greatly reduce their carbon footprint and joining the fight against climate change and the harmful pollution of our environment.


Your contribution, no matter how small can make all the difference. We need your support to get this initiative off the ground to help our children get a better education, while saving the environment and allowing for a brighter future. 











Plus, get to nominate your area and help use choose the school for our pilot solar installation.
*Make sure to include your nominated school, city/town, and state upon making a contribution. *Limited to area's located within the continental United States. 

To get the Brighter Classrooms program launched, we need to raise $50k to cover the initial administrative expenses, personnel costs, and the working capital necessary to get the program up and running. Once we reach the $50k milestone, we are targeting an additional $100k to fund our first solar energy donation. This will cover the costs for a 20kWh system to be installed on a school and greatly contribute to reducing the school's monthly electric bill and carbon footprint for the next 30 years.

What if we raise more than our target?
All funds raised above $50k will go towards the purchase and installation of a solar energy system. If we raise more than $100k additional, we will work on a second solar energy donation! 
Is this an ongoing campaign?
This is a one-time campaign designed to assist SolBid, Inc. in launching the Brighter Classrooms initiative. Although your contributions are not tax-deductible, we hope you see the value in helping us launch this initiative

What if we do not reach out target amount?


If we do not reach our target goal of $50k, we will still put the funds towards the launch of the Brighter Classrooms initiative and will work on continually putting a portion of our profits to getting the program launched. But pending on how short we fall of the goal, this cold take along time. Help us get this operational today and lets get helping our kids and the environment now!!
Other ways you can help.

We understand that not everyone can contribute, but you can still help our cause. 
Please get the word out and make some noise about the Brighter Classrooms campaign. Try using the Indiegogo share tools, they make it real easy!

How it works




Once we achieve
our first milestone, SolBid will have enough funds to launch the program and start funding the Brighter Classrooms Escrow account through this campaign. 


Once enough funds are raised, we will compile the list of nominated schools by you, our supporters. We will then rank the schools by the most to-least disadvantaged and deserving school in the U.S. based on a up-to-date listing of our nations school
districts and the following criteria: Local educational funding; recent budget
cuts; news of teacher layoffs; and pupil to teacher ratios.


Our supporters that selected a perk with the voting option will then bid on what school they feel is most deserved, selecting the winner, and we then make the contractual arrangements
for the donation.


We will then source the solar energy system for donation and outsource the installation
to a local solar energy installer for commissioning.


During the
installation, SolBid founders will spend a day at the school to educate the
faculty and students on the value of the solar energy system that was installed
and how it will benefit them, the school and the environment.


Following
commissioning of the solar energy system, we will launch a PR campaign
highlighting all of the contributors involved.
