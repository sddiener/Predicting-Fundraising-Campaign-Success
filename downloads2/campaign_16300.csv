<p><strong>WHO WE ARE:</strong></p>
<p>VIVO Ballet is a cutting edge American contemporary dance company based in New York City. The company is categorized by its innovative choreography, unique sense of style and emotive qualities.</p>
<p>VIVO Ballet was founded in 2015 by Artistic Director, Enzo Celli, in Rome, Italy. The founding team established two entities; VIVO Ballet a New York based dance company, and the VIVO Ballet Professional Training Center based in Rome.</p>
<p>Since its conception in 2015, VIVO Ballet has performed in international festivals in the USA, France, Portugal, Switzerland, and Italy. With roots in Rome, the company sprouted within the Professional Training Center and then located to a more permanent home in New York. In 2018 VIVO Ballet makes a debut on American soil with a complete cast of 14 dancers.</p>
<p>VIVO Ballet has set a goal for the Fall 2018 season to premiere two evening length works in a theater space in New York City, with 14 diverse, high-caliber dancers.</p>
<p>VIVO Ballet’s Fall production in New York will allow us be a major milestone for the company.</p>
<p><i>With your support we can continue creating!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHERE YOUR SUPPORT GOES:</strong></p>
<p>Your support is vital to our success, it will help us to secure funds for the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Technical Fees: </strong>The biggest cost weighing on our Fall 2018 season is renting theater space in New York City. Your donations will directly contribute to our theater rental deposits, rentals, lighting and sound design and operation, costumes, and space. With your help, VIVO Ballet will be able to premiere two evening length works on prestigious stages around New York City.</p>
<p><strong>Rehearsal Space:</strong> We all know that rent runs extremely high in NYC, and when you are looking for spaces large enough to dance in that cost adds up quickly. VIVO Ballet rehearses in artist friendly locations that try to keep the costs low, but over time it adds up! Your donations will help us rent studio space so we can create the Fall 2018 programs!</p>
<p><strong>Dancer Pay: </strong>VIVO Ballet is comprised of 14 wonderful, talented and devoted dancers. These dancers come from across the United States and around the world. They have donated countless hours of rehearsal, passion, sweat and commitment by dancing with VIVO ballet. We would like to use part of these funds to honor them for their hard work. Performing with VIVO Ballet in the fall season will provide an opportunity for each of these dancers to grow artistically. It is vital that we raise funds to respect this growth and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Staff pay:</strong> VIVO Ballet has amazing support behind the scenes that help with administration, public relations and communications. We need your help to give them the credit they deserve for making our Fall season run smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing: </strong>Part of the Fall season’s success depends on adequately getting the word about our shows out to the public. We need funds for web, print and social media materials.</p>
<p>Your support will ultimately contribute to the success and longevity of VIVO Ballet as a premiere contemporary dance company!</p>
<p>Any amount can make a large difference in VIVO Ballet’s evolution. Thank you!</p>

Peter Zachari and Joey Mirabile have been producing independent theater in New York City since 2011 starting with their production of Parker & Dizzy's Fabulous Journey to the End of the Rainbow at the New York International Fringe Festival. The show was selected as part of the Encore Series and remounted at The Players Theater. The show returned yet again at Theater for the New City in 2014. 
We have found the most wonderful artistic home at Theater for the New City. In the past five years we have presented a bevy of original shows: Fat Asses: The Musical, Under the Knife: A Farce, One Love, a freshly reimagined production of Parker & Dizzy's Fabulous Journey to the End of the Rainbow and the premiere of Anne Marilyn Lucas' From Silence.
Peter Zachari has rewritten, revamped, retitled this zany, cutting-edge farce.  We have the opportunity to bring this reimagined show in 2019 at Theater for the New City.

<p>Seen through our lens, Macbeth is a coming of age story, of a young man at a crossroads in which he is confronted with the man he is and the man he has always imagined himself to be. With the help of his most beloved partner, they take a course of action down a path that will simultaneously bring them all they ever dreamed possible while destroying the world around them and each other, bringing to them a wisdom far beyond their years.  It’s a cautionary tale. It’s a love story. It’s a play for now.</p>

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>How far would you go for something you believe is right? Who is responsible for violence and how do you break the cycle? <i>Days of Rage</i>, inspired by the activities of The Weathermen/Weather Underground Organization and The Black Panther Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s, tells the story of Jean Avery, who leads the militant protest group The Weathermen after her brother leaves for Vietnam, and Fred Hayward, the leader of the Chicago chapter of The Black Panther Party, who tries to keep his fellow Party members from descending into violence. As Fred and Jean’s paths intertwine, they grow closer and apart in a turbulent time of war, civil rights, and rage.</p>
<p>Days of Rage는 1960년대 말 1970년대 초반 반전운동, 흑인인권 운동을 한 Weather Undergound와 Black Panther Party의 운동에서 영감을 받아 만든 뮤지컬로 두 주인공, Jean Avery와 Fred Hayward를 통해 신념을 위해 어디까지 갈 수 있는지, 폭력과 비폭력의 방법으로 그들이 믿는 것을 이루고자 하는 그들만의 싸움을 통해 현재도 반복되는 폭력의 고리를 끊기 위해 우리가 할 수 있는 것은 무엇일까?라는 생각을 던져준다. </p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>We began writing <i>Days of Rage </i>because as artists we wanted to respond to the wars and civil rights injustices around the world in our own way. This musical is our movement--it illuminates the past so that we don't repeat our history. <i>Days of Rage </i>speaks to the growing anger among today's youth about how their government operates and its role in wars across the world. It asks who is responsible for violence in the world and how we can be responsible for breaking the cycle of violence. We believe that as artists we have a responsibility with the art we create to make a better world. With <i>Days of Rage</i>, we express our hope for this world.</p>
<p>Days of Rage has been developed with students from the University of California, Irvine; Two River Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, as part of a writers retreat; and with New York Theatre Barn as part of their New Works Series, a developmental reading, and an invitation to participate in their Choreography Lab last year.</p>
<p>This past year, we have had the amazing opportunity to be among the inaugural Sokoloff Arts Fellows at Town Stages in NYC. The culmination of our fellowship will be a two-performance workshop presentation of the first act of <i>Days of Rage</i>. We need your help to make this workshop possible.</p>
<p>예술을 하는 사람으로서 끊임없이 이어지는 전쟁이나 사회에서 일어나는 부조리들에 어떤식으로든 반응을 하고 싶었고, 유일하게 사용할 수 있는 무기가 음악과 이야기이기에 이 뮤지컬이 우리가 시작하는 작은 운동이 되면 어떨까 하는 마음에 작품을 쓰게 되었습니다. 예술가로서 세상을 좀 더 나은 곳으로 만들기 위한 책임이 있지않을까 하여 이 작품을 개발하게 되었고 뉴욕에서 리딩 시리즈를 통해 조금씩 다듬어가며 지금까지 오게 되었습니다. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing a workshop for a musical in New York City is an expensive endeavor. As part of our fellowship, we are getting a great deal on the space rental. However, this is a large cast show, and we will be paying 15 actors. This will add up to roughly $6,000. We will also be assembling a band of four musicians, which will add up to about $1200. Our director and choreographer will also receive stipends, as well as our designers (we are hoping to have a sound designer, lighting designer, and projection designer). </p>
<p>We are hoping to offset this cost with donations. Every little bit helps to make this workshop possible, and the more you give, the cooler the perk!</p>
<p>Fellowhip을 통해 장소를 마련하게는 되었지만, 배우, 스텝, 연주자, 연습실 등등. 워크샾을 꾸리기엔 적지않은 예산이 필요하고 여러분에게 도움을 받고자 합니다! 작은 후원도 큰 도움이 되오니 많이많이 도와주시고 금액에 따른 다양한 소정의 감사표시도 있사오니 많은 후원 부탁드립니다! </p>

<h3>The Impact of Your Contribution</h3>
<p>We truly can't do this workshop without your help. With this workshop, we will be able to see part of our show on its feet, allowing us to develop the show in a much more productive way. All the stage elements inform how a show is working--the lights, the movement, the choreography--and we've never been able to see this with our previous readings of the show, which have the actors with scripts behind music stands. This workshop will also allow us to show <i>Days of Rage </i>to producers who can potentially help bring our show from a workshop to a full production. We believe this workshop will succeed in achieving both of these goals.</p>
<p>여러분의 도움이 없으면 워크샾은 불가능할거예요. 워크샾을 통해 무대에서 실현이 되면 어떨지 보며 한 단계 좀 더 발전시킬 수 있고, 또한 이것을 통해 이 작품이 실제 무대로 가게 될 수 있는 기회를 만들고자 합니다. </p>

From thought-provoking shows to characters with heart and soul, we're dedicated to theatre which is braver, smarter and kinder. </p>
<p><strong><i>le Monocle</i></strong> is the untold story of the Parisian lesbian bar, its clientele and Violette Morris – the successful race car driver and athlete who later became involved with the German SS.

Her herd is content to munch clovers, but Mathilda's mind is full of questions. When an orange balloon makes a surprise appearance on the farm, Mathilda discovers there is more to who she is than being a grey sheep! But the other sheep don’t understand - how can she be an orange balloon? All they see is a little grey sheep. As she explores what it means to be orange, Mathilda leads her herd (and our narrators) on a journey of self-discovery and the joys of self-expression until Mathilda, the narrators, the sheep, and the audience realise that when it comes to who you are, anything is possible!</p><p><strong>The Message</strong></p><p>Mathilda’s story shows young people and their adults that the language we choose to identify ourselves and our families matter. Identity language isn’t universal - what one thing means to me doesn’t have to be the same as what it means to you, and that’s awesome! We hope our audience members leave the show feeling a greater acceptance and inclusion of diversity, the freedom to define yourself, and excitement to express your own unique you!</p><p><strong>The Method</strong></p><p>Developed in R&amp;D at Sheffield Theatres in March 2018, the play is performed simultaneously in British Sign Language, Spoken English, and through animated projections, so it’s accessible to D/deaf, hearing, and hard of hearing audiences and across ages, regardless of sign language literacy or reading skills. All performances are relaxed, and everyone is welcome. Our cast includes Deaf and hearing actors from diverse backgrounds, giving kids the chance to see themselves represented on stage. In the last act of the play, the audience is invited up onto the stage, to play with the cast in Mathilda’s fully realized tactile farm. Young audience members get to explore identity words through a playful, relaxed game and adult audience members observe a conversation about identity with kids, taking away concrete tools for continuing this conversation at home.</p><p><strong>The Tour</strong></p><p>Mathilda and the Orange Balloon is set to debut in London in February at Greenwich and Lewisham Young People’s Theatre. Following that, in the Spring, she’ll make her way to Cambridge Junction, New Wolsey in Ipswich, Arlington Arts Centre in Newbury, Attenborough Arts Centre in Leicester, and Touchbase Pears in Birmingham, bringing her message all across London, Southeast, and Midlands.

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>George Houston Bass, director of Rites and Reason, the black theater group at Brown University where we were both English department faculty, suggested that we work together on a play. As a result of that conversation, <i>Garvey Lives</i>! my first attempt at playwriting—and the first ever  produced about the legendary Pan African activist, Marcus Garvey, had its premiere production at Brown in 1972.</p>
<p>Primarily a prose writer and novelist, I was concentrating that year mostly on the activities related to the publication of my second novel, <i>Runner Mack</i>, which was nominated for the 1972 National Book Award. After writing the play, I focused for the next decades on my prose writing.</p>
<p>Then about a year ago,  Bob Gumbs, an ardent devotee and champion of the accomplishments of Black Moses, wanted to know if I had considered revising my play. The time is ripe, he said, given the nation’s retooled discussion about our racial divide and the political and social consequences swirling around us.</p>
<p>But where could I find the assistance I needed to revise my play about Garvey? I met playwright producer Ron Beverly who liked the play’s potential. We decided that collaborating on what Ron terms reinvisioning the drama for 2018 would take about a month. We would engage in highly interactive collaboration, for the best adjustments of style, structure and theme. We see our final reinterpretation as a great jumpstart, a launching pad for further development.</p>
<p>And why not travel to Kingston, Jamaica for this concentrated focus where we could breathe the air and surroundings of Garvey’s birthplace? After all, he is their national hero. And that’s why we have a campaign at Indiegogo. We want to raise funds to allow us two playwrights to go to Kingston, Jamaica for a spirited, uninterrupted stretch of writing. The revised play will then be ready for expansion into workshops, staged readings, and theatrical exposure.</p>

<h3>OUR GOAL—WHAT WE WANT FROM DONORS</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">We want to reinterpret the 1972 first play produced about Marcus Garvey to reflect our current era. Our country is a 2018 stage of characters grappling with the tumultuous issues of race, sex and power that have exploded onto our landscape at an undeniable tempo. At the crux of our national conversation are issues introduced by Garvey. We will show that this time is his time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">Our goal is to bring back into the international spotlight the riveting philosophy of one of the greatest organizers in black history. Martin Luther King, Jr., said that Garvey was the first man “to give millions of Negroes a sense of dignity and destiny.” Further, his philosophy of black self-determination influenced international activists like Nelson Mandela, Jomo Kenyatta, and Kwame Nkrumah.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">Garvey’s argument—and theatrical flair—captured the black imagination. Blacks needed their own government, their own economy, and their own organizations to be successful in a world that subjugated and marginalized them. He said to escape the suffering, look to Africa. So, he founded a steamship line to take his people back to the continent. He saw black enterprise evolving from global connections. And he pushed for a Pan-African government.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">We are in a heyday of activism right now, unlike anything we've seen. It's time to bring up our children to understand important values, to teach them by the actions we take and by what we care about. </p>

<p>Of course there are no guarantees that the revision will meet its goals of acceptance and production. But every major creative endeavor faces those obstacles that hinder success.

Our optimism is driven by the quality of our team, the success of the original production, and the profound message that Garvey represents. 
 
BUDGET AND EXPENSES
 
The $19,000 in our budget covers the following expenses:
Roundtrip coach air fare to Jamaica for two
Room and board for two in a Kingston, Jamaica b&b including 2 meals daily for 30 days
Dramatist Guild approved compensation for two in a collaborative writing agreement
Marketing for Internet social media activity 
Indiegogo fees

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>We need more women in comedy. Luckily, we're funny as hell, and we honestly need your support.</p>
<ul>
<li>We're Carly Woods and Katie Dessin. Two actresses and writers, living respectively in Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon. From the dawn of our friendship all those years ago, we've been driven. And we got a habit of coping with our depression with making each other laugh, and diving head first into projects that are entirely too ambitious.</li>
<li>
<strong>Simply put: we want to change the world, but right now, we want to make you guys laugh</strong>. Life is short. Sh*t is rough out there. Making fun of ourselves in front of a live studio audience is exactly the kind break from the 24 hour news cycle we all need.</li>
<li>With your help, we can show a honest (and humorous take) on the struggles of friendship, the fears that come with success, and how much New Jersey really sucks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This show is our heart and soul, and like any artist, we are dying to share that with you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Okay, here's the nitty gritty:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We need 7k</strong>. As in $7,000. All of our funds have gone to securing the theatre. This money goes directly to the remainder of the booking costs for the run at the AWARD WINNING (seriously) Hudson Mainstage Theatre. The space alone costs $6,500. <strong>If we reach our goal, we'll extend to $10k</strong> (!!), because after that, we've got a set to build, designers and dressers to pay... productions cost money. We cannot do this without your help. (*for a full itemized financial breakdown, email tooambitiousshow@gmail.com, so we don't bore you with the logistics here. We promise your money is going to a good, creative cause.)</li>
<li>
<strong>MOST IMPORTANTLY (if you ask us), we're giving back to you guys, and we're f*cking excited to do it. Here's what you'll get when you donate to Too Ambitious:</strong><br/><br/>$10 - Signed Program <br/>$25 - Dedicated Carpool Karaoke Video, and all above<br/>$50 - Selfie on set with Cast &amp; Crew, and all above<br/>$75 - Special Thanks in Program, and all above<br/>$100 - Social Media Video Shoutout, and all above<br/>$200 - Invitation to Industry After Party, and all above<br/>$500 - Mention by name in script, and all above<br/>$750 - Seat Next To Reserved Jeff Goldblum Chair (ONLY THREE AVAILABLE), and all above<br/>$1000 - Producing Credit, and all above</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you live in LA, you're already rolling your eyes. But for the viewers at home, this is for you: by supporting us, local theatre, our projects... you're changing our lives.</p>

<h3>The Risk Is Worth It</h3>
<p>It's a lot to put on a show. We're ready to tackle whatever comes at us. Both of us are resourceful, sometimes insane, but most importantly, we're passionate as sh*t. As you'll find out in our show, we can accomplish anything as long as we are together. So rain or shine, no matter what obstacle -- we will be there for you guys.

<h3>Shelly Hawkins-Artistic Director</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548876656/z4vxynkbr0hjmj733ezp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Shelly Hawkins is a dancer, teacher, and choreographer who has called Tucson her home since 2003. Shelly has danced for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and was a principal dancer with Tucson’s Artifact Dance Project.  She has choreographed for both the proscenium stage and non-traditional spaces including the Tucson Museum of Art and the Phoenix Art Museum. Shelly received her Masters of Fine Arts from the University of Arizona School of Dance with an emphasis in choreography and performance and was the recipient of the Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award for the College of Fine Arts. She has taught both major level and non-major level dance classes at UA, and University of Nevada Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Shelly’s choreographic style is contemporary, inventive and expressive, and is influenced by Giordano jazz and Lewitzky modern techniques. Her work is often non-narrative, though typically expresses an evolution or journey. Thematically, her work reflects ideas of feminism, transformation, the afterlife, and an exploration of truth and reality. </p>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Hawkinsdance seeks to contribute to the growth of the Tucson arts community and the collective American cultural landscape through its commitment to the propagation of new choreographic works. We believe that generating new work creates the opportunity for human connection, and is not only fundamental to enriching our community but essential to expressing the ideas and values of this age. We value unbridled creative expression and pursue the horizons of our potential in order to contribute to the forward progression of the universal and ageless art form of dance. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Hawkinsdance is extremely excited to present our first self-produced show, The People Electric. A self-produced contemporary dance show involves many different moving parts, our incredible dancers, theatre rental, lighting, music, flooring, rehearsal costs, advertising, etc. Dance is a physical art form, utilizing human bodies as the visual medium and Hawkinsdance has hired nine professional dancers for our first show. We are proud to offer fair wages to our dancers because we understand the importance of paying artist what they deserve. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization we consider everyone who makes a donation to be a collaborator and a Hawkinsdance family member. The total cost to produce our show is $20,000. With close to half of that goal being met, we have $10,000 left to raise to be able to meet our goal. We are proud to offer certain perks to our donors who meet levels of $15, $60, $120, $300, and $1000. These perks include custom rehearsal footage, Hawkinsdance logo stickers, Hawkinsdance t-shirts, signed photo prints from one of our company members, and two tickets to the main event: The People Electric. ANY and ALL donations are appreciated and support the creation of new contemporary dance!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Historically, dance companies in the United States were able to receive federal funding in the form of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. As arts funding has been significantly cut over the years, funding for dance companies, especially smaller local organizations, has become almost nonexistent, with the bulk of the funding going to the largest institutions.  By the time the leftover funds trickle down to medium and smaller sized companies, the amount left is minimal at best.  One of the biggest risks involved with starting a dance company and producing a show is doing so without sufficient government funding. This is where our donors and collaborators play a crucial role!</p>
<p>Your donation allows us to offer our dancers paid contracts. Most contemporary artists use non-living materials to produce their artwork, whether that be oil paints, watercolors, sculpting materials, technology, etc. As a contemporary dance company, our work is collaborative in nature, where the role of a dancer in the rehearsal and performance processes is crucial.</p>
<p>Shelly Hawkins has successfully started Hawkinsdance and been commissioned to do several works in the company’s first year. Some of Hawkinsdance’s past performances include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Residency at the Tucson Museum of Art for the Arizona Biennial 2018 Exhibition. Hawkinsdance was featured in three events, featuring site-specific works created for the museum</li>
<li>Shelly Hawkins is the recipient of stART Grant, presented by the Arts Foundation for Tucson and Southern Arizona</li>
<li>Selected for the Breaking Ground Dance and Film Festival, with Hawkinsdance being commissioned for original work at this years’ festival</li>
<li>Collaborated with local musicians Jillian Bessett and Anton Faynberg to perform original work alongside their original compositions</li>
<li>Created <i>Current Exhibitions</i>, a Hawkinsdance original film at the Tucson Museum of Art, directed by Shelly Hawkins with videography by Julius Schlosberg</li>
<li>Community Performances at JCC, Club Congress, Tucson Museum of Art, Tempe Festival of the Arts, and the Phoenix Art Museum</li>

<p>My fledgling Theatre company, Labyrinth Arts Underground, needs a push from the nest- and we would be honored to receive that shove from YOU!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The level of commitment that these actors have put into this show is equivalent to taking on a part-time job <i>in addition </i>to the jobs they already work! Paying a rehearsal stipend, clothing them in appropriate performance attire, and ensuring a respectable, reliable rehearsal space are just a few ways to thank them for the work they have done, and continue to do.</p>
<p>Aside from being able to provide my ensemble with an appropriate baseline, support from friends, family, and theatre-lovers means the world to me! Building a show like this from scratch takes time, energy, blood, sweat, and tears- having a network of people who believe in that is incredibly important.</p>
<p>Transforming art from concept to reality is a true gift!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Details</strong></h3>
<p>The show opens <strong>Saturday, January 19th</strong> at <strong>9:00pm</strong> and runs each Saturday night until <b>February 23rd.</b></p>
<p>We perform at the front studio at the Prop Thtr, an experimental theatre venue in Chicago's Avondale neighborhood: 3502 N Elston Ave, Chicago, IL 60618.</p>

An interactive performance that takes stories from the audience and brings them to life on stage.
 
About us
Hello!
My name's Madeline, I'm a Chicago area director, actor, and theatre-maker mounting a unique piece of theatre in Chicago called ""The Roaring Ones"". The show premiers at the Prop Thtr in the Rhinoceros Theatre Festival, opening late January 2019. 
This project is a collision of passions; improvisation, dance, movement, music, all with a Bacchic flourish. I've assembled a roster of amazing artistic collaborators and we cannot wait to show you our work.
My fledgling Theatre company, Labyrinth Arts Underground, needs a push from the nest- and we would be honored to receive that shove from YOU!
 

The Breakdown
Funds will cover

Rehearsal space - $125 

Actor rehearsal stipends - $300 ($50 per actor)
Costumes and props - $100

Print materials (such as art work, posters, advertisements, programs) -$75

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Night Shadows — Or, One Hundred Million Voices Shouting</i> focuses on the life of Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, just prior to, during, and after the Russian revolution. In the play she is keeping her promise to tell of “the true twentieth century”—of lives disrupted, her poetry banned, and so many loved ones lost under Stalin’s brutal regime.</p>
<p>We are raising funds to bring our play about this poet's heartbreaking and inspiring life, a story that resonates with the world we are living in now, to the On Women Festival at the Irondale Center in Brooklyn for performances March 11th through 14th, 2020.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a minimum of $4500 to pay salaries and cover publicity, scripts, programs, and art for the production. All who donate will be mentioned in the program and we offer various small gifts in return, starting with our gratitude and ranging from signed programs from the show, tickets to opening night, and a variety of material related to Akhmatova's poetry,</p>
<p>With director Scott Klavan, we are assembling a most astonishing cast (soon to be announced here), and after two staged readings (at Emerging Artists Theatre in 2017 and HB Playwrights Theatre in 2018), we are very excited to now have a full production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One of Akhmatova’s challenges was to remain an artist and speak up through her poetry at a time when it was not allowed and was even life-threatening, both to her and those close to her.  It just might inspire us all to speak up in whatever way we can.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>If you can't contribute, please do come to see the play: March 11 to 14th at Irondale Center in Brooklyn.  And spread the word! That is the ultimate support. </p></div></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Clarification Theatre Company</h3>
<p>We're Courtney Henson and Hazel Mayall, founders of Clarification Theatre Company. We're both graduates from the Arts University Bournemouth who have one common consuming passion - to illuminate difficult issues for local communities. Our productions will be created with an aim to shed light on topics that seemed so important as children in school assemblies but now have floated into the back of our minds as adults.</p>
<p>Clarification's first production, Of Hemlock I Had Drunk, is a performance of tension and certain uncertainty. It is an exploration of mortality and questions both society's impulse control and our fascination with death. It is a play very close to the heart of its writer, co-founder Hazel Mayall, who has an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis and, because of the way her brain works, has constantly struggled with the concept of death. It's an incredibly important production to both her and the company, so any help to get this to wider audiences will be so very gratefully received.</p>
<p>We believe our play will make a difference. Help make that difference by donating.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How your donation will help us:</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise £1000 to cover our company's start up costs.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rehearsal spaces</strong> - We're hoping to put some of the money raised back into the community by supporting venues like <strong>The Crumbs Project</strong> in Bournemouth, which ""is a <strong>charity which provides training for independence for adults with learning disabilities, mental health issues and stabilized addictions.</strong>"" The money they receive from room hire is put directly ""back into the project to<strong> support people with special life challenges to have better life chances.</strong>"" We think that would be a great use of your money - helping charity and helping our company rehearse is a <strong>two in one benefit!</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertising Material</strong> - Word of mouth is unbelievably helpful, but we need <strong>posters,</strong> <strong>business cards, fliers, etc. </strong>to get the word out. We might have a play, a director, and a full cast, but we still need the most important element:<strong> An Audience!</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Paying our Cast and Crew </strong>- Our lovely actors are taking time out, (some even using up work holiday!) to join us on this journey. We want to pay them for their time and pay them fairly too! We also have other people currently involved working on sound, video, and graphic design and we think they deserve to be paid for their brilliant work! We want to start as we mean to go on.</li>
<li>
<strong>Venues</strong> - Venues aren't free, nor are they cheap. If we want to hire out a venue to be able to put on our previews and full show, we'll need the money!</li>
<li>
<strong>Transportation </strong>- Until we have a company minibus (...and when one of us learns to drive), we'll need to use the dreaded <strong>public transportation</strong>. Trains and busses will be taken by all members of the cast from a variety of locations. We will use money raised to reimburse transportation costs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Registering as a Company</strong> - Basically, everything about starting a theatre company costs a lot of money, including, well, <i>being</i> a company in the first place!</li>
</ul>
<p>So as you can see, we have a lot to put your money towards - Every bit of spare change counts!</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>

<p><b>“Runaway Princess, a Hopeful Tale of Heroin, Hooking and Happiness” Comes to Galway Fringe</b></p>
<p><b>Mary Goggin’s Multiple Award Winning Show Plays July 23rd through July 28th</b></p>
<p><b>June 19 – (NEW YORK, NY) “Once upon a time, there was a Princess born to a King and Queen who were banished from their island, forced to flee to America in a coffin ship.” Thus begins the tale of the Runaway Princess… in which Mary Goggin shares a true story, laced with wicked humor and much pathos, of her Irish Catholic upbringing, drug addiction and prostitution, and the multitude of characters she encountered along the way to ultimately finding joy. Goggin brings Runaway Princess, A Hopeful Tale of Heroin, Hooking and Happiness to Galway Fringe from July 23rd through July 28th. The play, which swept up three awards at United Solo Festival 2018 in New York City (Best Storyteller, Solo Critics Choice, Best Seller), will run for six performances at The Loft, 7 Bridge Street. All performances are at 3pm, and all tickets are 12€.</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>“Miss Goggin injects effortless humor into a masterful story of drugs, homelessness and prostitution… from Ireland to the Bronx she vividly describes the debaucheries of the 70s…the story of someone who has come into herself.” All About Solo Critics Choice.</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Mary Patricia Goggin’s family hails from Schull, Co Cork and Bangor Erris, Co Mayo (God help us!). Her parents emigrated from Ireland to the Bronx, New York, where Mary was born in the 1950s.

Goggin is delighted to make her Galway Fringe debut with Runaway Princess.</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Her favorite recent roles include “Ella O’Neill” (mother of Eugene O’Neill) in Ann Hansen’s “Road to Babylon,” in the Broadway Bound Festival. She has enjoyed being directed by Cyndy Marion in numerous Tennessee Williams works including, Cavalier for M’Lady, Clothes For A Summer Hotel and A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot.

“Runaway Princess, a Hopeful Tale of Heroin, Hooking and Happiness” Comes to Galway Fringe
Mary Goggin’s Multiple Award Winning Show Plays July 23rd through July 28th
June 19 – (NEW YORK, NY) “Once upon a time, there was a Princess born to a King and Queen who were banished from their island, forced to flee to America in a coffin ship.” Thus begins the tale of the Runaway Princess… in which Mary Goggin shares a true story, laced with wicked humor and much pathos, of her Irish Catholic upbringing, drug addiction and prostitution, and the multitude of characters she encountered along the way to ultimately finding joy. Goggin brings Runaway Princess, A Hopeful Tale of Heroin, Hooking and Happiness to Galway Fringe from July 23rd through July 28th. The play, which swept up three awards at United Solo Festival 2018 in New York City (Best Storyteller, Solo Critics Choice, Best Seller), will run for six performances at The Loft, 7 Bridge Street. All performances are at 3pm, and all tickets are 12€.
 
“Miss Goggin injects effortless humor into a masterful story of drugs, homelessness and prostitution… from Ireland to the Bronx she vividly describes the debaucheries of the 70s…the story of someone who has come into herself.” All About Solo Critics Choice.
 
Mary Patricia Goggin’s family hails from Schull, Co Cork and Bangor Erris, Co Mayo (God help us!). Her parents emigrated from Ireland to the Bronx, New York, where Mary was born in the 1950s. She returned in her teens to live with her aunt and continue her education with the nuns in Glasnevin, before leaving again for New York where she went on to forge a successful career as an actor on stage and in film for 20 years. Goggin is delighted to make her Galway Fringe debut with Runaway Princess.
 
Her favorite recent roles include “Ella O’Neill” (mother of Eugene O’Neill) in Ann Hansen’s “Road to Babylon,” in the Broadway Bound Festival. She has enjoyed being directed by Cyndy Marion in numerous Tennessee Williams works including, Cavalier for M’Lady, Clothes For A Summer Hotel and A Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot. Mary appeared in PB & J for the NY Fringe Festival and Born to be Blue, a winner in the Samuel French Festival. Her favorite TV roles include spots in Broad City, Law and Order, Guiding Light, The Grind (Amazon). Favorite film roles include Little Children, MAD (soon to be released), The Trouble with Bliss, Gasoline, Bronx Paradise. Mary is the recent winner of the Best Actress Award at The NJ Recovery Film Festival for her role in Reservations, a film by Jeanine Flynn, directed by Neal Hemphill.
 
Dan Ruth (Director) is an award-winning actor and performance artist. His solo play, A Life Behind Bars, has been produced in New York City, Los Angeles and around the country, and is the winner of the 2016 United Solo Festival Award for “Best Autobiographical Show,” The 2018 Bistro Award winner for “Outstanding Solo Play,” MAC Award for “Best Spoken Word Artist” and the 2018 Producers Encore Award from the Hollywood Fringe Festival. Dan has directed both regionally and in NYC where he also served as a core director for The A-Train Plays at the Sanford Meisner Theatre.

Grateful for you 
The Impact of Runaway Princess
Simply put if I bypassed talking about the things I did when I was drunk and high. I’d still be drunk and high. Self-honesty is the key.
I am only as sick as my secrets.
Drug use is a symptom of a soul sickness a sickness that is, in our culture, very often treated with other drugs…for example Methadone and Narcan.
Don’t talk and don’t die.
I say talk about it.
Runaway Princess is, I hope, is gracefully honest. We need to talk about everything. This I hope, is achieved in RP; sharing what I did as opposed to preaching...walking the walk. Do what I do....not what I say.  Oh, and when you see the show…its ok to laugh…I know its wicked.
Isolation and the inability to communicate are the hallmark traits of addiction.
I can only speak for myself. When I first got sober I was like an open wound and the only word I knew was fuck!
Now after a lot of work on myself including 27 years of therapy. I have a feelings vocabulary and a voice and I am funny as hell.
And most of all grateful.
Boy, did I learn to communicate and I am not alone.
My wickedly funny ..absolutely true Solo Show was written in 2017,
Written to give others permission to share their secrets, to know they are not alone.
I need to reach those that may not ever make it to a meeting (or a shrink) and die.
I am and have been a professional actor for 20 years.
I’d been sober a year and attended this retreat in Garrison, New York for recovering alcoholic women. I sat down with this nun, she asked, “Are you an actor?” I said, “Yeah, I wish.” That’s when I realized that is what I wish! When I started doing theater I found it. I found out who I was.

I was told to keep doing my show (of course the sold out shows and awards helped)

I put all my resources to create RP and bring it this far.
Contributors help support an antedote to the opiod crisis. To keep it going, keep the story being told.


The money is for airfare to Shannon for the Galway Fringe.
Its for air fare and accommodations for 10 days, I need to hire Stage Manager and Tech for sound and lights. 
If there is money left over I am doing the Charm City (Baltimore) Fringe  October 10th to 20th..Check my websites for details/updates

Εκείνη τη στιγμή που και οι δύο βρίσκονται στον πυρήνα του plenum, που δεν είναι τίποτα άλλο παρά το μέσο του κενού. Εκείνες τις στιγμές που ο καθένας, σε μία αδιάκοπη προσπάθεια κατάκτησης της ανεξαρτησίας, δεν επιβιώνει χωρίς τον άλλον. Ο σημαντικός Άλλος είναι εκείνος που επηρεάζει τη σκέψη, τα συναισθήματα. Είναι εκείνος που κατασκευάζει την πραγματικότητα. Σε έναν άδειο χώρο, παραδομένο στην απλότητά του, δεσμεύονται και καθρεφτίζονται όλα. Δεσμευόμαστε εμείς και μέσω της επαφής, μελετάμε τις σχέσεις κάτω από την επιφάνεια. Τις σχέσεις μέσα μας, όπου εγώ και οι Άλλοι νοηματοδοτούμε την ενθάρρυνση, την υποστήριξη, την εμπιστοσύνη. Μία σχέση μοναδικότητας, μία σχέση της οποίας τα θεμέλια βρίσκονται στη μοναχικότητα του καθένα. Μία σχέση πλήρης και ταυτόχρονα μετέωρη. Δύσκολη στις ισορροπίες. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Η συμβολή σας σε αυτό το έργο <strong>θα μας βοηθήσει</strong> να πετύχουμε τους στόχους μας και να υλοποιήσουμε τις ιδέες μας. Θα μας βοηθήσετε να νοικιάσουμε ένα στούντιο χορού για πρόβες. Οι πρόβες είναι πολύ σημαντικές στη διαδικασία δημιουργίας. Οι απαιτήσεις του φεστιβάλ είναι πολύ υψηλές και θέλουμε να παρουσιάσουμε μια παράσταση που να αντιστοιχεί σε αυτό το επίπεδο. Ωστόσο, καθώς δεν διαθέτουμε χρηματοδότηση, το κόστος ενοικίασης χώρου είναι ιδιαίτερα σημαντικό και είναι αδύνατο να το καλύψουμε χωρίς τη βοήθειά σας. Επίσης, <strong>θα μας βοηθήσετε </strong>να σχεδιάζουμε και να δημιουργήσουμε κοστούμια υψηλής ποιότητας. Η σχεδιάστρια των κοστουμιών είναι μία ανερχόμενη σχεδιάστρια που ζει και εργάζεται στο Βέλγιο. Ωστόσο, τα υφάσματα και ο σχεδιασμός είναι μια πολύ σημαντική και χρονοβόρα διαδικασία. Με τη βοήθειά σας, τα υφάσματα θα αγοραστούν και θα βοηθήσετε στη δημιουργική διαδικασία της κατασκευής των κοστουμιών μας. Κλείνοντας, <strong>θα μας βοηθήσετε </strong>στο σχεδιασμό φωτισμού. Αυτή είναι η πρώτη φορά που θα δημιουργήσουμε μια παράσταση που δεν είναι site-specific και θα είναι στη σκηνή. Ως εκ τούτου, είναι απαραίτητο να συνεργαστούμε με έναν τεχνικό φωτισμού.</li></ul>

<i><strong>`We find each other in the plenum`</strong></i> is a duet. The full (plenum) is the opposite of the vacuum. We are talking about the plenum of each one of us. At that moment both are in the core of the plenum, which is nothing but the middle of the vacuum. Those moments when everyone, in an unremitting effort to gain independence, does not survive without the other. The important Other is the one that affects my thoughts, my feelings. She is the one who creates my reality. In an empty space, surrendered to its simplicity,everything is reflected. We commit ourselves and through contact, we research relationships under the surface. The relationships within us, which give a meaning to encouragement, support, trust. A complete and at the same time unrelated relationship. Difficult to balance.<br/><br/>The circle is completed. Having presented two performances, complementary to each other, a 30-minute complete show at the Central Stage of the theater `The Train At Rouf``will be presented in September.<br/> <br/>In July 2019 there was an audition held to choose the dancer who will be with me on this creative journey.  I got very lucky to meet and finally collaborate with Sofia. The purpose of this performance is to create the base for a longer-lasting project, which will be sent to festivals in Greece and the rest of Europe. </li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>In a world of loneliness, we create together.</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Contributing in this project will help us to achieve our goals and make our ideas true.</strong> <strong>You`ll help us </strong>renting a dance studio to rehearse. Rehearsals are very important in our creating process.  The requirements of the festival are very high and we want to present a performance that corresponds to the level of the festival. However, as soon as we do not have any funding, the cost of renting a space is particularly important and it is impossible to cover it without your help.  <strong>Also, You`ll help us</strong> to design and create high quality costumes.   The costume designer is a rising Greek designer who lives and works in Belgium. However, fabrics and design, as well as sewing costumes is a very important and time-consuming process. With your help, the fabrics will be purchased and you will help in the creative process of creating our costumes. <strong> In closing, you will help us</strong> with lighting design. This is the first time we will create a show that is not site-specific and will be on the stage. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate with a lighting technician who specializes in lighting design.</li></ul>

Αυτή τη φορά συνυπάρχουν δύο γυναίκες στη σκηνή. 
Πρόκειται για τη μεταβίβαση και το «μοίρασμα» εμπειριών δύο γυναικών.

Η συμβολή σας σε αυτό το έργο θα μας βοηθήσει να πετύχουμε τους στόχους μας και να υλοποιήσουμε τις ιδέες μας. Θα μας βοηθήσετε να νοικιάσουμε ένα στούντιο χορού για πρόβες. Οι πρόβες είναι πολύ σημαντικές στη διαδικασία δημιουργίας. Οι απαιτήσεις του φεστιβάλ είναι πολύ υψηλές και θέλουμε να παρουσιάσουμε μια παράσταση που να αντιστοιχεί σε αυτό το επίπεδο. Ωστόσο, καθώς δεν διαθέτουμε χρηματοδότηση, το κόστος ενοικίασης χώρου είναι ιδιαίτερα σημαντικό και είναι αδύνατο να το καλύψουμε χωρίς τη βοήθειά σας. Επίσης, θα μας βοηθήσετε να σχεδιάζουμε και να δημιουργήσουμε κοστούμια υψηλής ποιότητας. Η σχεδιάστρια των κοστουμιών είναι μία ανερχόμενη σχεδιάστρια που ζει και εργάζεται στο Βέλγιο. Ωστόσο, τα υφάσματα και ο σχεδιασμός είναι μια πολύ σημαντική και χρονοβόρα διαδικασία. Με τη βοήθειά σας, τα υφάσματα θα αγοραστούν και θα βοηθήσετε στη δημιουργική διαδικασία της κατασκευής των κοστουμιών μας. Κλείνοντας, θα μας βοηθήσετε στο σχεδιασμό φωτισμού. Αυτή είναι η πρώτη φορά που θα δημιουργήσουμε μια παράσταση που δεν είναι site-specific και θα είναι στη σκηνή. Ως εκ τούτου, είναι απαραίτητο να συνεργαστούμε με έναν τεχνικό φωτισμού.
 
English Description

`We find each other in the plenum` is a duet. The full (plenum) is the opposite of the vacuum. We are talking about the plenum of each one of us. At that moment both are in the core of the plenum, which is nothing but the middle of the vacuum. Those moments when everyone, in an unremitting effort to gain independence, does not survive without the other. The important Other is the one that affects my thoughts, my feelings. She is the one who creates my reality. In an empty space, surrendered to its simplicity,everything is reflected. We commit ourselves and through contact, we research relationships under the surface. The relationships within us, which give a meaning to encouragement, support, trust. A complete and at the same time unrelated relationship. Difficult to balance.The circle is completed. Having presented two performances, complementary to each other, a 30-minute complete show at the Central Stage of the theater `The Train At Rouf``will be presented in September. In July 2019 there was an audition held to choose the dancer who will be with me on this creative journey.  I got very lucky to meet and finally collaborate with Sofia. The purpose of this performance is to create the base for a longer-lasting project, which will be sent to festivals in Greece and the rest of Europe. 
In a world of loneliness, we create together.
 

Contributing in this project will help us to achieve our goals and make our ideas true. You`ll help us renting a dance studio to rehearse. Rehearsals are very important in our creating process.  The requirements of the festival are very high and we want to present a performance that corresponds to the level of the festival. However, as soon as we do not have any funding, the cost of renting a space is particularly important and it is impossible to cover it without your help.  Also, You`ll help us to design and create high quality costumes.   The costume designer is a rising Greek designer who lives and works in Belgium. However, fabrics and design, as well as sewing costumes is a very important and time-consuming process. With your help, the fabrics will be purchased and you will help in the creative process of creating our costumes.  In closing, you will help us with lighting design. This is the first time we will create a show that is not site-specific and will be on the stage. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate with a lighting technician who specializes in lighting design.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $1250 to support the development and production of a new play about the world of art and our human connection to the art we experience, called Black Deer In Blizzard. A new play by emerging writer Steven Griffin, we are seeking support to produce the show in Fringe festivals and uplift the work of young talent in Toronto.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Show</h2>
<p>Black Deer In Blizzard is a play about a painter's daughter and an art forger meeting to try to understand the worthiness of authenticity in art. With this project, we are exploring the separation between art and artist, real and fake, and if it really matters at all. Interrogating our modern obsession with perfectly curated lives for public consumption, the show sets out to ask why we create, what that creation means, and the value of authentic creations in a world built for ""Insta-experiences."" The show is a way for us to question the things we experience and how we experience them together. </p>
<p>Black Deer In Blizzard is set to premiere in summer 2020.  As part of our artistic values, the production will have a diverse, equitable creative team both on and offstage and will include mentorship opportunities for new and emerging talent to help develop their craft.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you'll support the work of a dozen independent artists and creators working to make the art that is stronger, more inclusive, and more accessible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Who We Are:</h2>
<p>Black Deer In Blizzard is helmed by two young artists with a wide array of experience in theatre and independent production. </p>

<p><strong>Steven Griffin (Playwright &amp; Director for Black Deer in Blizzard)</strong> is a Toronto based director and writer of both theatre and film. He's had short films screened in numerous festivals including Toronto ArtHouse Film Fest, Kingston Film Festival, and the Toronto International Shorts Festival. As a theatre director, his most recent fringe show “Dominion” played at 2017’s Toronto Fringe Theatre Festival and he was named talent to watch by NOW magazine. In addition to that, he has directed for both Toronto Queer Theatre Festival and InspiraTO Theatre Festival (where the show, One Small Step, won the People’s Choice for Best Play). His work tends to play with perspective, to explore the rationales someone will convince themselves of in order to justify their own life choices, and focuses on time, and the short amount of it that we have. He has always been very curious about different lifestyles having grown up around family and friends who mostly existed in the same economic/geographical spaces. The frustration of only being limited to the individual perspective and understanding of himself has fueled his obsession with exploring the logic and rationale of others. The show comes from that obsession with people's relationships to art and the effect a person connected to an artist can have when attempting to enjoy that person’s art.</p>

<h2>Where Will Your Money Go?</h2>
<p>The funds from this campaign will form part of the budget for the production going to each other shows various expenses. This includes:</p>
<p><strong>60% goes to the Artists</strong> - The creators, innovators, explorers, and risk-takers jumping onto this project with us. Your donation will help them get paid a fair and decent wage for their tireless creative effort. This ensures that the artists we bring on board can focus dedicate their time to crafting artistic excellence.</p>
<p><strong>11% goes into production costs</strong> - Space to work, design costs, printing. Your funds will help us create a dazzling world, then fill it with beautiful light and incredible soundscapes. This money brings the page onstage.</p>
<p><strong>11% goes to marketing</strong> - By being here you already know about the show but so many other people have yet to hear about it. The money going to marketing will help us advertise on multiple platforms, create posters and postcards to drum up excitement, and help get the public seeing the work of the incredible artists on this project. </p>
<p><strong>18% goes to Admin</strong> - The Application fees and costs for theatre festivals. They help us produce the work at a significant discount, allowing us to put more of our funds to the people behind the project,  but they still need to cover some costs too!</p>

The link to that site is: <a href=""https://fundraising.fracturedatlas.org/making-a-scene-a-history-of-twin-cities-dance-1960-2020/campaigns/2961"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://fundraising.fracturedatlas.org/making-a...</a> </p><p>If you prefer to send a check my address is PO Box 16436, St. Paul, MN 55116. Please make the check out to Fractured Atlas for the tax deduction.</p><p> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>The book will provide a comprehensive history of Twin Cities (TC) dance – or rather as comprehensive as possible, given the breadth of experience and story. The main time frame will be 1960 to 2020 – a span of 60 years – however I will introduce some of the pioneers and defining events pre-1960 to set the stage. Mid-2021 is when I hope the book will be self-published so the last chapter will be a summation through 2020 and a look forward. </p><p>The focus will be on a variety of companies, schools and individual artists as well as their collaborators, presenters and funders. A variety of dance and movement-based performance techniques will be featured including ballet, modern/postmodern dance, improvisation, tap/percussive dance, hip hop, American Indian, and the wide variety of international forms represented in the community.</p><p>In addition, the book will provide additional context with other artistic movements such as the rise of the TC music scene and local social justice or other legal concerns that crossover with the arts. </p><p>The book will also place the TC scene within the context of the national dance landscape and show its reciprocal influence on larger dance communities such as NYC. Finally, while the book will focus on the TC there will be an exploration of relevant influences from other parts of the state such as college dance programs that “feed” the TC scene. </p><p>I have attempted to seek a publisher locally and nationally. All I have contacted agree that it is worthy project but difficult to market because the subject matter is region-specific. Still, I believe there are many stories that need to told, so now I'm crowdfunding with the hopes that there will be a book that others would like to see here in Minnesota, and possibly beyond. </p><p>To my knowledge there has never been a book offering a comprehensive overview of the TC dance scene. Nationally, there are books covering specific eras in dance history and dance artists, with significant focus on connections to New York City. However, given the significant list of artists, companies and historic events associated with the TC dance community, a book on its contributions would be welcome to the local and national conversation on dance.   </p><p>Plan:</p><p>Primarily, I will conduct interviews with choreographers, dancers, musicians, lighting and set designers, presenters, writers/editors, funders, philanthropists, and historians. </p><p>I will dig into archives at the University of Minnesota and New York Public Library Jerome Robbins Dance Division at Lincoln Center as well as the Minnesota History Center, Walker Art Center, Star Tribune, City Pages/Sweet Potato, Twin Cities Reader, Pioneer Press, Minnesota Daily, Jerome Foundation, McKnight Foundation and Dance Magazine archives (among others).</p><p>Additionally, I will review available imagery (photographic and video/film) plus additional documentation from New York-based companies with strong Minnesota ties such as Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Trisha Brown Dance Company, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company, Bebe Miller, Ralph Lemon, Charlie Moulton, Twyla Tharp, and David Gordon and Pick-up Company.</p><p>The manuscript will be approximately 300 pages with about 20 percent individual images including photography, posters, flyers, choreographer notes and diagrams, lighting, costume and set design examples, music composition examples, and other related documentation. </p><p>It is also my hope that this book can spark an exhibit and website. </p><p>Anticipated Costs: Copies, mileage, transcribing, photo rights, one trip to New York to research at the NYPL archives and interview artists with TC connections, self-publishing fees, outside editor costs, website, basic marketing in the TC area</p><p>Background:</p><p>2019 will mark my 30th year as a dance and performance writer. My first arts writing gig was for Paper Magazinein New York City in 1989. When I moved to Minnesota in 1994 I started contributing to City Pages and in 2008 joined the Star Tribune’s freelance pool. I  recently stopped freelancing to work full-time as a state employee but see this change as the perfect opportunity to focus on a book project I have long anticipated.</p><p>Writing honors include the Mike Steele Fellowship from the University of Minnesota Journalism Center, Critics’ Travel Study Grant from the Center for Arts Criticism, American Theater Fellowship, Sage Cowles Land Grant Chair/Cowles Guest Artist Opportunity in the University of Minnesota Dance and Theater Department, and critic/presenter through the Link Vostok International East-West Arts Exchange (Kostroma and Yaroslavl, Russia). </p><p>I spent several years in arts administration after I graduated from Barnard College in New York (English major/dance minor). I worked at Performance Space 122 and Dance Theater Workshop in New York City (NYC), Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Massachusetts, and the Minnesota Dance Alliance in Minneapolis. I also provided freelance grant writing and company management services for several artists. I became well acquainted with many artists in this work.</p><p>In December 1998 I graduated from law school and began working as a lawyer full time in 1999, but stayed committed to arts writing. I hold a special interest in artistic approaches that incorporate social justice perspectives given my early career exposure promoting work by artists caught up in the censorship debates created by Congressional scrutiny of the National Endowment for the Arts in the early 1990’s. </p><p>Aside from covering the arts, I have written or co-written several law review articles and other legal publications. I contributed a chapter to Awakening from the Dream: Civil Rights Under Siege and the New Struggle for Equal Justice (Carolina Academic Press 2005). </p><p>Although I have been writing about the Twin Cities dance scene since 1994, when I moved to Minneapolis, I was already well aware of the rich arts community. From 1989 to 1994 I was an arts publicist and writer based in New York City. I was exposed to several Twin Cities-based artists during this period and knew of Minneapolis, in particular, as an important tour stop for New York City-based artists through my connections to the Performance Space 122 Field Trips program and the National Performance Network touring program operated through Dance Theater Workshop. </p><p>I began freelancing for City Pages in Minneapolis in 1994 and wrote extensively on dance and performance art for many years there. In 2008 I began writing for the Star Tribunein Minneapolis. I estimate that I have written hundreds of articles, reviews and spotlights about dance, with the majority focused on Twin Cities-based artists. I can draw from my own archive for source material.</p><p>As a writer and fan, I am aware of some of the pioneers who built the Twin Cities dance (going back as far as the 1930’s and 40’s) as well as the artists and scholars who are the current keepers of the stories of the dance community. I also know the newest generation of innovators. I have watched emerging choreographers grow into leaders, seen the ups and downs of major institutions for dance, witnessed the birth of companies who now have national or even international reach, and observed the rich diversification of the community through a wide array of cultural and aesthetic influences. I have been on the frontlines of challenging moments (the financial troubles of the Minnesota Dance Alliance), witnessed successes (the opening of the Cowles Center for Dance and Performing Arts and the Walker Art Center’s McGuire Theater), and seen work blossom on stages of all sizes as well as in site-specific settings.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","NOTE: I have received fiscal sponsorship from Fractured Atlas, meaning donations made through Fractured Atlas are tax-deductible.

Please make the check out to Fractured Atlas for the tax deduction. Summary:The book will provide a comprehensive history of Twin Cities (TC) dance – or rather as comprehensive as possible, given the breadth of experience and story. The main time frame will be 1960 to 2020 – a span of 60 years – however I will introduce some of the pioneers and defining events pre-1960 to set the stage. Mid-2021 is when I hope the book will be self-published so the last chapter will be a summation through 2020 and a look forward. The focus will be on a variety of companies, schools and individual artists as well as their collaborators, presenters and funders. A variety of dance and movement-based performance techniques will be featured including ballet, modern/postmodern dance, improvisation, tap/percussive dance, hip hop, American Indian, and the wide variety of international forms represented in the community.In addition, the book will provide additional context with other artistic movements such as the rise of the TC music scene and local social justice or other legal concerns that crossover with the arts. The book will also place the TC scene within the context of the national dance landscape and show its reciprocal influence on larger dance communities such as NYC. Finally, while the book will focus on the TC there will be an exploration of relevant influences from other parts of the state such as college dance programs that “feed” the TC scene. I have attempted to seek a publisher locally and nationally. All I have contacted agree that it is worthy project but difficult to market because the subject matter is region-specific. Still, I believe there are many stories that need to told, so now I'm crowdfunding with the hopes that there will be a book that others would like to see here in Minnesota, and possibly beyond. To my knowledge there has never been a book offering a comprehensive overview of the TC dance scene. Nationally, there are books covering specific eras in dance history and dance artists, with significant focus on connections to New York City. However, given the significant list of artists, companies and historic events associated with the TC dance community, a book on its contributions would be welcome to the local and national conversation on dance.   Plan:Primarily, I will conduct interviews with choreographers, dancers, musicians, lighting and set designers, presenters, writers/editors, funders, philanthropists, and historians. I will dig into archives at the University of Minnesota and New York Public Library Jerome Robbins Dance Division at Lincoln Center as well as the Minnesota History Center, Walker Art Center, Star Tribune, City Pages/Sweet Potato, Twin Cities Reader, Pioneer Press, Minnesota Daily, Jerome Foundation, McKnight Foundation and Dance Magazine archives (among others).Additionally, I will review available imagery (photographic and video/film) plus additional documentation from New York-based companies with strong Minnesota ties such as Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Trisha Brown Dance Company, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company, Bebe Miller, Ralph Lemon, Charlie Moulton, Twyla Tharp, and David Gordon and Pick-up Company.The manuscript will be approximately 300 pages with about 20 percent individual images including photography, posters, flyers, choreographer notes and diagrams, lighting, costume and set design examples, music composition examples, and other related documentation. It is also my hope that this book can spark an exhibit and website. Anticipated Costs: Copies, mileage, transcribing, photo rights, one trip to New York to research at the NYPL archives and interview artists with TC connections, self-publishing fees, outside editor costs, website, basic marketing in the TC areaBackground:2019 will mark my 30th year as a dance and performance writer. My first arts writing gig was for Paper Magazinein New York City in 1989. When I moved to Minnesota in 1994 I started contributing to City Pages and in 2008 joined the Star Tribune’s freelance pool. I  recently stopped freelancing to work full-time as a state employee but see this change as the perfect opportunity to focus on a book project I have long anticipated.Writing honors include the Mike Steele Fellowship from the University of Minnesota Journalism Center, Critics’ Travel Study Grant from the Center for Arts Criticism, American Theater Fellowship, Sage Cowles Land Grant Chair/Cowles Guest Artist Opportunity in the University of Minnesota Dance and Theater Department, and critic/presenter through the Link Vostok International East-West Arts Exchange (Kostroma and Yaroslavl, Russia). I spent several years in arts administration after I graduated from Barnard College in New York (English major/dance minor). I worked at Performance Space 122 and Dance Theater Workshop in New York City (NYC), Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Massachusetts, and the Minnesota Dance Alliance in Minneapolis. I also provided freelance grant writing and company management services for several artists. I became well acquainted with many artists in this work.In December 1998 I graduated from law school and began working as a lawyer full time in 1999, but stayed committed to arts writing. I hold a special interest in artistic approaches that incorporate social justice perspectives given my early career exposure promoting work by artists caught up in the censorship debates created by Congressional scrutiny of the National Endowment for the Arts in the early 1990’s. Aside from covering the arts, I have written or co-written several law review articles and other legal publications. I contributed a chapter to Awakening from the Dream: Civil Rights Under Siege and the New Struggle for Equal Justice (Carolina Academic Press 2005). Although I have been writing about the Twin Cities dance scene since 1994, when I moved to Minneapolis, I was already well aware of the rich arts community. From 1989 to 1994 I was an arts publicist and writer based in New York City. I was exposed to several Twin Cities-based artists during this period and knew of Minneapolis, in particular, as an important tour stop for New York City-based artists through my connections to the Performance Space 122 Field Trips program and the National Performance Network touring program operated through Dance Theater Workshop. I began freelancing for City Pages in Minneapolis in 1994 and wrote extensively on dance and performance art for many years there. In 2008 I began writing for the Star Tribunein Minneapolis. I estimate that I have written hundreds of articles, reviews and spotlights about dance, with the majority focused on Twin Cities-based artists. I can draw from my own archive for source material.As a writer and fan, I am aware of some of the pioneers who built the Twin Cities dance (going back as far as the 1930’s and 40’s) as well as the artists and scholars who are the current keepers of the stories of the dance community. I also know the newest generation of innovators. I have watched emerging choreographers grow into leaders, seen the ups and downs of major institutions for dance, witnessed the birth of companies who now have national or even international reach, and observed the rich diversification of the community through a wide array of cultural and aesthetic influences. I have been on the frontlines of challenging moments (the financial troubles of the Minnesota Dance Alliance), witnessed successes (the opening of the Cowles Center for Dance and Performing Arts and the Walker Art Center’s McGuire Theater), and seen work blossom on stages of all sizes as well as in site-specific settings.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<strong>Our creative goals are ambitious for a week</strong> -  <i>but we will do a lot of prep with the musical director, directing mentor, and dramaturge in advance</i>; every moment of the workshop will be used strategically to develop the musical numbers and work on the crucial relationships and scenes.

Bilal's first play, Acha Bacha, had its world premiere in 2018 and has been published by Playwrights Canada Press. *unconfirmedIris - Dan's 6-year-old daughterPlayed by Emily Andrews (she/her), an Actor and Producer. She studied and graduated with her BA from the prestigious London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts in London, England. Her theatre acting credits go as far as the West End in London and the World famous Edinburgh Festival, and she toured across Canada in a variety of theatre productions. How will we do it?We don't know how the world will look or how COVID protocols will adapt. So Call Me Papa will be covid-safe. Roseneath is providing us with cameras and green screens, and we will use them to design an interactive way to share our shows with students across the province - whether learning in school or at home. We will also send out kits with fun interactive props for students to use while watching the show!We have raised $7500 in government funds so far of a 10.5 k+ budget for this one-week development workshop. Most of the budget is being used to pay artists.We need to raise another $3,000 to: 
Pay trans actors - above the minimum requirement - they deserve it
Pay technicians, musicians, and ourselves 
Purchase props, instruments, unanticipated tech needs
Print scripts 
Purchase covid safety supplies (masks, antiseptic wipes)
Purchase contents of the kits we will be sending to audience members - top-secret interactive *FUN STUFF* 
Purchase postage to ship the kits
Pay ASL interpreters**
Challenges

We are innovating a new way of presenting live theatre in schools, and there will be technical details to figure out, but we trust that with the help of Roseneath and Franco Pang (No More Mr. Rice Guy), we will be able to figure out how to do this


We need schools to invite us into their virtual classrooms. We are confident that we will get the word out between Roseneath’s network and our networks by reaching out to other trans-positive organizations. 


Our creative goals are ambitious for a week -  but we will do a lot of prep with the musical director, directing mentor, and dramaturge in advance; every moment of the workshop will be used strategically to develop the musical numbers and work on the crucial relationships and scenes. But, again, we have veterans in our corner, and we are excited to tackle these challenges!!!


Covid might prevent rehearsing/performing in-person Fingers crossed it won’t happen, but we have a contingency plan, again through the magic of green screens.

The goal is to strengthen the capacities of Congolese dancers for a professional development</p><p><strong>- GDF CHAMPIONSHIPS :</strong> An urban dance competition for children and adults, whose goal is to give dancers the opportunity to present their arts and techniques and choose the best.<br/>Winners are rewarded with opportunities to travel abroad in the region and internationally to represent D.R. Congo in other festivals and partner competitions.</p><p>- Conferences: A day of discussions and reflections on solutions to problems related to the evolution and development of dance and hip-hop culture in Goma and in DR Congo,</p><p><strong>- GDF Theater :</strong> to organize an evening of exhibition of dance piece of the genre Hiphop Theater and contemporary which will be presented by various dance companies of Goma and elsewhere. But also by the same occasion to present to the public some shows created the workshops during the GOMA DANCE CAMP.</p><p><strong>- GDF TOURS : </strong>The city of Goma being the tourist capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, as every year the festival will organize a tourist tour with the guests at the end of the festival in order to promote the spirit of tourism and show the beauty of the country.</p><p><strong>Why the Festival?</strong></p><p>In D.R.

<p>Mixed-Race Mixtape at its core is a coming-of-age story: a young man struggling to define who he is, where he belongs. And it’s more than that, too. </p>
<p>Fig, as a young, mixed-race Latino man, faces challenges unique to those whose lives are impacted by race everyday. What is it like being ‘ambiguously brown’?  How can you navigate the world as a person of color and feel proud, authentic and safe? What does it mean to be authentic?<i>Who am I to me?</i></p>
<p>Mixed-Race Mixtape portrays the experiences that shaped one young person’s identity and through these interactions with police, teachers, friends and family, <b>we are led to reflect on what has shaped our own identities</b>.</p>
<p>Fusing theatre and Hip-Hop, <b>Mixed-Race Mixtape makes difficult topics relatable, stirring and vivid.</b> It’s a fun, interactive performance experience accessible to all, and specifically designed for communities typically excluded from traditional theatre spaces.</p>

<h3>Message From The Writer:</h3>
<p>Growing up as a mixed-Latino, I have struggled through many confusing, uncomfortable and alienating experiences–never sure where I fit, even when I knew where I wanted to fit. It has taken me 23 years to begin understanding these experiences and to express my growth through them all.</p>
<p>The last year and a half I have dug deep, unburied memories that were meant to be kept in the ground–discovered dirt lodged into my finger nails, still warm from my childhood–hands full, with my roots again. Mixed-Race Mixtape is the result of my explorations. My chance to re-plant and continue to grow. My honest, un-apologetic and vulnerable story through the only form I feel comfortable enough to share it in: Hip-Hop.</p>
<p>I pray for sun and water so I can share it with you all.</p>

Mixed-Race Mixtape at its core is a coming-of-age story: a young man struggling to define who he is, where he belongs. And it’s more than that, too. 
Fig, as a young, mixed-race Latino man, faces challenges unique to those whose lives are impacted by race everyday. What is it like being ‘ambiguously brown’?  How can you navigate the world as a person of color and feel proud, authentic and safe? What does it mean to be authentic?Who am I to me?
Mixed-Race Mixtape portrays the experiences that shaped one young person’s identity and through these interactions with police, teachers, friends and family, we are led to reflect on what has shaped our own identities.
Fusing theatre and Hip-Hop, Mixed-Race Mixtape makes difficult topics relatable, stirring and vivid. It’s a fun, interactive performance experience accessible to all, and specifically designed for communities typically excluded from traditional theatre spaces.

  Our Mission & Impact 
Re-imagine how youth of color are represented in media by changing the conversation and offering positive alternative role models.
Present content that is accessible and engaging.
Provide low-cost and free tickets at every performance.
Take the ideas and conversation sparked by the Mixed-Race Mixtape beyond the theatre doors. 
From ads and film to the evening news, we believe that media strongly influences how we shape our identities and how we think we should identify others. This is especially true for youth, and specifically youth of color, who have to look harder than their white counterparts for mainstream representations. The examples that can be found are, with few exceptions, caricatures that draw on racist stereotypes that offer virtually nothing in the way of emotional or situational complexity. Mixed-Race Mixtape seeks to re-imagine how youth of color are represented in media by changing the conversation and offering positive alternative role models. We believe the show will spark important dialogue about these issues in many communities of color. 
The conversation about race in the US has been and is incomplete. Mixed-Race Mixtape fills in the gaps by tackling big questions through a personal point of view. Have you ever wondered...


What shapes our ideas of cultural and racial authenticity?
How do you navigate the historical power dynamics at play within mixed-raced identities?
How does this affect how we, as people of color, imagine claim and police our own identities?
How does this affect how white people imagine, claim and police the identities of people of color?


While Mixed-Race Mixtape is specifically about Latin@ identity, we believe it can also inspire wider conversations about similar issues in many communities of color. 


We want to have these conversations with everyone, but specifically young people of color and youth in general. 
Mixed-Race Mixtape presents content that is accessible and engaging. Our tickets will also be accessible because we'll provide low-cost and free tickets at every performance. This show can be perform in a wide range of venues from community and cultural centers and schools to theatres, music halls and back yards. 
We will take the ideas and conversation sparked by the Mixed-Race Mixtape beyond the theatre doors by hosting post-show talkbacks, inviting local Hip-Hop artists to participate in our events and offering workshops about identity and creating art for social justice.

    
What We Can Accomplish With Your Support
Your support will go towards many, many, many vital elements of developing a performance piece for touring including, but not limited to: 

purchasing equipment
renting rehearsal and performance space
printing posters and merch
copyrighting and lawyers fees
paying artists, from graphic designers to musicians and technicians

We want to pay everyone involved in the project a living wage. Although our society often tells us it’s a luxury, we believe art is a vital part of all our lives. By funding this project, you are not only supporting the development of an important and relevant show, you are also saying you believe artists deserve a financially sustainable career path. You can be sure we’re putting it to good use. 

Message From The Writer:
Growing up as a mixed-Latino, I have struggled through many confusing, uncomfortable and alienating experiences–never sure where I fit, even when I knew where I wanted to fit. It has taken me 23 years to begin understanding these experiences and to express my growth through them all.
The last year and a half I have dug deep, unburied memories that were meant to be kept in the ground–discovered dirt lodged into my finger nails, still warm from my childhood–hands full, with my roots again. Mixed-Race Mixtape is the result of my explorations. My chance to re-plant and continue to grow. My honest, un-apologetic and vulnerable story through the only form I feel comfortable enough to share it in: Hip-Hop.
I pray for sun and water so I can share it with you all.

From country music, to comedy and murder mysteries, the town boasts a great deal of entertainment and activities for the tourists. But our intent is to make a show that all the family can enjoy and bring their children to and something adults can enjoy as well. An interactive comedy that changes every month and encourages imagination, interaction and the geek culture. In this the NJ4K Matinée Comedy Theatre proudly presents, ""Meet the Ravens"", a comedy inspired by the Addams Family and The Munsters, live on stage. We will also be producing three other productions throughout the year, starting with Sherlock Holmes in the Spring, Adam Atom in the Summer and our Nevermore Christmas special.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249269/files/20150225143345-Sherlock_002a.png?1424903625"" src="""" style=""width: 215.896396396396px; height: 334px;""/>            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249273/files/20150225143417-NEVERMORECHRISTMAS.png?1424903657"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 216.237082066869px; height: 334px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p></p>What you will us help create is a totally new experience for Branson where your family can enjoy a fully entertaining experience and interact with it directly. Heckle the show, be invited on stage, dress up as a character from a comic book or film and win prizes. A show perfectly suitable for geeks and people of all ages and walks of life. And audio/visual experience consisting of film live performance and more importantly, a contributing audience. </div><div>
<h3>The Cast and Crew</h3>We are all experienced actors and stage hands some of us going back with 25 years of stage experience and acting, some of us as young as 10 to 45. We have had experience in all fields from the Rocky Horror Show, Shakespeare and the local Audio and Visual productions of Jonah here in Branson. Our hands on experience is second to none and our drive for perfection and to entertain is just as insatiable. We all have a lot of love for our art, and the talent we have procured is utterly amazing. All of whom have bright futures ahead of them and we are proud to have them aboard.</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249477/files/20150225160516-DSC_0165.JPG?1424909116"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>A new show is always a challenge, from it's conception to it's eventual premier. Our show is intended to go through the year of 2015 and follow on again in 2016, but the start is always the first hurdle. We need at least $3,500 to get the show of the road, this includes funding for the theater itself, the props, costume and the technical aspects of the show from sound to the video and stage effects. Budget is always an issue, but at the very least this is the number we need to create something really enjoyable for the Branson crowd and the tourists. If we at least reach our 45% goal we can guarantee the theater and the audio visual elements are in place and we will have the show we envision, but the goal is vitally important to make it truly work. Some may ask how one can start a show on such a low budget, and it's easy when the producer himself is a visual effects coordinator and is more interested in getting the show of the ground than paid for his initial work. It's the show that will make or break the team, not the initial build up. We have three venues in mind for the show, but we cannot announce those until we get the official go ahead from said theaters. That said we are focusing on the route 76 strip in Branson for full impact.</p>
<p>Our most important need right now is a projector for our screen for one. Our intent is to make this a fully visual production, extending our sets into a virtual background, giving you an in depth feeling of interaction. Imagine if you will, Sherlock at the train station, people interacting in the background and an entire train comes on to the set upon which Sherlock and Watson board and the train leaves the stage in it's full glory. This is the four dimensional world we want to bring to you.</p>
<p>Also we need skin mics for sound. Audio is by far the most important aspect of our show, and with your support we will have the money needed to create a professional production with quality visual and sound elements that you deserve.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>Can't have a fund raiser without the perks now can we? It's important to us to make you feel a part of something wonderful and your contribution to this production is valued greatly. By checking our perks you find everything from the obligatory thanks, the standard T-Shirt to more unique one of a kind perks you won't get anywhere else. The perks you will find are as unique as the show we are creating and will be something you will treasure, we hope, for years to come.</div><div>

</div><div>
<div>Branson is a wonderful city, so full of untapped talent and potential, it is a popular town that can go much further if it moves on to more exciting and unique things, whilst at the same time holding onto it's core values and the shows that made it what it is today. This show is about Branson as a whole, not just the 76 strip or the Landing, but everything about it and it's surrounding areas. With beautiful vistas, untapped spots to enjoy, boating, fishing, country walks, malls, entertainment, eating and activities, you will find as we perform this show that we shall open your eyes to many levels of Branson you may not have considered visiting before now.</div>

<p>Also this show will create an experience for your family. Something the kids will enjoy if they get too bored of golfing, or swimming. We encourage cosplay and dress up and will offer prizes to the best of the show every evening. As well as activity packs for the children to enjoy and use to take part in during the show. Our intent is make this show as interactive and as audience friendly as possible. Branson being the venue of the every growing Visioncon, a comicbook convention held at the Radisson Motel every year, the Matinée Comedy Theatre will definitely appeal to geeks and nostalgic hearts alike.</p>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Starting a new show is always a risk, which is why we have asked for such a small amount to get us started. The risks are obvious so our tactic is to get us out there through as many means as possible. We have three venues in mind, and a forth in the works. Out strategy is to spread our show through Branson to get established, giving the population a choice of three shows to choose from.

</div></div>","Short Summary Branson Missouri is a town of opportunity and talent, surrounded by a lush and beautiful mountainous country and the consider the central hive of entertainment in South West Missouri. From country music, to comedy and murder mysteries, the town boasts a great deal of entertainment and activities for the tourists. But our intent is to make a show that all the family can enjoy and bring their children to and something adults can enjoy as well. An interactive comedy that changes every month and encourages imagination, interaction and the geek culture. In this the NJ4K Matinée Comedy Theatre proudly presents, ""Meet the Ravens"", a comedy inspired by the Addams Family and The Munsters, live on stage. We will also be producing three other productions throughout the year, starting with Sherlock Holmes in the Spring, Adam Atom in the Summer and our Nevermore Christmas special.

            
What you will us help create is a totally new experience for Branson where your family can enjoy a fully entertaining experience and interact with it directly. Heckle the show, be invited on stage, dress up as a character from a comic book or film and win prizes. A show perfectly suitable for geeks and people of all ages and walks of life. And audio/visual experience consisting of film live performance and more importantly, a contributing audience. 
The Cast and CrewWe are all experienced actors and stage hands some of us going back with 25 years of stage experience and acting, some of us as young as 10 to 45. We have had experience in all fields from the Rocky Horror Show, Shakespeare and the local Audio and Visual productions of Jonah here in Branson. Our hands on experience is second to none and our drive for perfection and to entertain is just as insatiable. We all have a lot of love for our art, and the talent we have procured is utterly amazing. All of whom have bright futures ahead of them and we are proud to have them aboard.

  What We Need A new show is always a challenge, from it's conception to it's eventual premier. Our show is intended to go through the year of 2015 and follow on again in 2016, but the start is always the first hurdle. We need at least $3,500 to get the show of the road, this includes funding for the theater itself, the props, costume and the technical aspects of the show from sound to the video and stage effects. Budget is always an issue, but at the very least this is the number we need to create something really enjoyable for the Branson crowd and the tourists. If we at least reach our 45% goal we can guarantee the theater and the audio visual elements are in place and we will have the show we envision, but the goal is vitally important to make it truly work. Some may ask how one can start a show on such a low budget, and it's easy when the producer himself is a visual effects coordinator and is more interested in getting the show of the ground than paid for his initial work. It's the show that will make or break the team, not the initial build up. We have three venues in mind for the show, but we cannot announce those until we get the official go ahead from said theaters. That said we are focusing on the route 76 strip in Branson for full impact.
Our most important need right now is a projector for our screen for one. Our intent is to make this a fully visual production, extending our sets into a virtual background, giving you an in depth feeling of interaction. Imagine if you will, Sherlock at the train station, people interacting in the background and an entire train comes on to the set upon which Sherlock and Watson board and the train leaves the stage in it's full glory. This is the four dimensional world we want to bring to you.
Also we need skin mics for sound. Audio is by far the most important aspect of our show, and with your support we will have the money needed to create a professional production with quality visual and sound elements that you deserve.


What You GetCan't have a fund raiser without the perks now can we? It's important to us to make you feel a part of something wonderful and your contribution to this production is valued greatly. By checking our perks you find everything from the obligatory thanks, the standard T-Shirt to more unique one of a kind perks you won't get anywhere else. The perks you will find are as unique as the show we are creating and will be something you will treasure, we hope, for years to come.
The Impact

Branson is a wonderful city, so full of untapped talent and potential, it is a popular town that can go much further if it moves on to more exciting and unique things, whilst at the same time holding onto it's core values and the shows that made it what it is today. This show is about Branson as a whole, not just the 76 strip or the Landing, but everything about it and it's surrounding areas. With beautiful vistas, untapped spots to enjoy, boating, fishing, country walks, malls, entertainment, eating and activities, you will find as we perform this show that we shall open your eyes to many levels of Branson you may not have considered visiting before now.


Also this show will create an experience for your family. Something the kids will enjoy if they get too bored of golfing, or swimming. We encourage cosplay and dress up and will offer prizes to the best of the show every evening. As well as activity packs for the children to enjoy and use to take part in during the show. Our intent is make this show as interactive and as audience friendly as possible. Branson being the venue of the every growing Visioncon, a comicbook convention held at the Radisson Motel every year, the Matinée Comedy Theatre will definitely appeal to geeks and nostalgic hearts alike.



   Risks & Challenges  Starting a new show is always a risk, which is why we have asked for such a small amount to get us started. The risks are obvious so our tactic is to get us out there through as many means as possible. We have three venues in mind, and a forth in the works. Out strategy is to spread our show through Branson to get established, giving the population a choice of three shows to choose from. We have also been offered smaller venues to promote our show to families and children alike, so we are in for a busy year. But we intend to make it as entertaining as possible for all involved. Our intent is one way or another, everyone who lives, visits, or works in Branson will know who we are, and what we do. We are proud to have received support from many of the local shows already and many local big names who seen and appreciate the need for a new show such as this. Getting out there and known is not so much a challenge as it is to be heard, so determination and advertising is going to be a wonderful and interesting challenge for us, and our producer sells adverting so that is our ace in the hole.   Other Ways You Can Help We realize not everyone can contribute financially, but we do need your help to get the word out there. We have allowed for 30 days to raise the funds we need to get started, but a campaign alone is useless without your support. We ask that you get the word out, support us, use your social media, word of mouth anything you can to make this campaign a success, not only for the show but for a new experience in Branson.

<p>The House of Bernarda Alba (Spanish: La casa de Bernarda Alba) is a play by the Spanish
dramatist Federico Garcia Lorca. Commentators have often grouped it with Blood Wedding
and Yerma as a ""rural trilogy"". Lorca did not include it in his plan for a ""trilogy of the Spanish
earth"" (which remained unfinished at the time of his murder).
</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Lorca described the play in its subtitle as a drama of women in the villages of Spain. The
House of Bernarda Alba was Lorca's last play, completed on 19 June 1936, two months
before Lorca's death during the Spanish Civil War. The play was first performed in 1945. The
play centers on the events of a house in Andalusia during a period of mourning, in which
Bernarda Alba, her five daughters and the housekeeper also live there.
</p>
<p>The deliberate exclusion of any male character from the action helps build up the high level
of sexual tension that is present throughout the play. Pepe ""el Romano"", the love interest of
Bernarda's daughters and suitor of Angustias, never appears on stage. The play explores
themes of repression, passion, and conformity, and inspects the effects of men upon
women.

<p><strong>What is Kidz Theater?</strong></p>
<p>When Kristen Caesar, Artistic Director, began Kidz Theater in San Diego in the late 90s, she set out on a quest to provide performance opportunities for and make theater magic tangible to young performers. </p>
<p>Kidz Theater, its performers, and its staff have now spanned two coasts and over two decades on a quest to find what each performer's brand of magic is.  With a passionate leader in Kristen and a love for the art form of musical theater in each person who comes to Kidz Theater, our quest to make magic tangible becomes more and more real for a new child every single day.</p>
<p><i>But we can't do it alone.</i></p>
<p><strong>Magic Online</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 Pandemic sent us fully online for over a year.  In the middle of auditions for our spring production of “Carousel” last March, we were forced to find a way to move the entire company’s mission to be able to provide the same home and opportunities we have afforded young performers for over 20 years to our computer screens.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has devastated the arts in New York City.  Broadway theaters remain dark.  Smaller companies have closed their doors forever.  We are still in the middle of a crisis that seems like it may never end.  But through that all, Kidz Theater’s mission has become even more important.  When the arts come back, the education we provide will be instrumental in breathing life into our new, post-pandemic world.</p>
<p><strong>Why Should I Care?</strong></p>
<p>Kidz Theater is one of the only educational theater programs in New York City that offers professional theater training at a low cost, and about 50% of our performers receive a scholarship. In addition to performance opportunities, we also train young technicians, stage managers, directors, and all of the disciplines it takes to bring a musical to life.</p>
<p>Our alumni are currently at musical theater programs across the country, and several are slated to resume touring or performing in their Broadway productions once theaters can resume normal operations.</p>
<p>Kidz Theater also provides a home for many kids and teens that need the space to grow and evolve as performers.  Our disappearance would cause the performing arts in New York City to suffer greatly.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Meet Our Goals?</strong></p>
<p>Money is tight these days.  We know that now more than ever.  And with the arts on hold for a while, it may feel like your money is going nowhere.  That could not be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Each dollar provides a child or a teenager with an opportunity to learn and grow with our program.  This money goes into scholarships for those who need help affording tuition, so that we never have to turn someone away who wants to learn.  This money goes into making sure we have the materials, the time, the staff, and the space to shape our curriculum.  This money makes sure that we can provide the best quality education that we can.  This money helps us to approach the daunting task of preparing to re open live.</p>
<p><strong>I'm SO Broke.  How Else Can I Help?</strong></p>
<p>The best thing you can do is spread the word.  Share this campaign on your Twitter, or Insta, or Finsta, or wherever you can.  Call your friends and dictate the url to them out loud if you have to.  But word of mouth has always been first and foremost how Kidz Theater survives.</p>
<p>Also, we are always looking for the donations of goods/services to add to our incentives to donate.  If you can offer a 1-hour private lessons with yourself or any artists you’re connected with, signed Playbills, Signed Original Cast Recordings; anything that can enrich this campaign and the performers we know (and those we don't, yet!), that is a welcome service.</p>

<p>The play is <b><i>First

<p><b></b></p><h3><b>East Time Last Time</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Scott
Sharplin studied playwriting at the National Theatre School, and has had
scripts produced all across Canada, along with publications by Signature
Editions, Athabasca University Press, and Playwrights Canada Press. Scott’s scripts
have produced belly laughs from Cape Breton audiences before, in both the Cape
Breton Stage Company’s production of <i>ZomRomCom</i>
(2013) and in the Fortress of Louisbourg’s musical comedy, <i>A Recipe for Love </i>(2013). He also has more than 20 years’ directing
experience, and he currently teaches playwriting and directing at Cape Breton
University.</p>
<p>For his play’s
Eastern Canadian premiere, Scott sought out two of the most talented and
versatile performers in Cape Breton: Wesley J. Colford (Ben) and Jenna Lahey
(Airlea). Wesley studied at Sheridan College and George Brown College. Since
then he has split his time between Sydney and Toronto, where he has worked
professionally and semi-professionally in a variety of disciplines with some of
Canada’s leading artists. Sydney audiences will recognize him from HAT’s
production of <i>Punch Up</i>, while Toronto
crowds associate him with the company he co-founded, <a href=""http://www.aimforthetangent.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aim for the Tangent Theatre</a>.</p>
<p>Jenna Lahey has
been an actor in Cape Breton since 2000, when she joined the Fortress of
Louisbourg’s Murder Mystery plays. In 2010, she began performing elsewhere in
the Cape Breton theatre scene, quickly becoming one of the busiest artists on
the island. Some of her favourite roles include Annie in <i>Oklahoma! </i>(Boardmore, 2011), Theresa in <i>In the Valley </i>(CBSC, 2013), Roxane in <i>Cyrano de Bergerac </i>(Boardmore, 2014), and Goneril in <i>King Lear </i>(Bandshell, 2014). She is the
recent winner of a Boardmore One-Act Festival award (Best Supporting Actress).</p>
<p>Together, these
artists formed the Big Smokey Collective, an artists’ co-op designed to bring
high-quality Cape Breton theatre to audiences off the island. <b><i>First
Time Last Time</i></b> is our first venture, and for a play that’s all about a
small-town kid finding love in the big city, where better to head than Toronto?</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>First Time Passe Time<br/>
</b></h3><p></p>
<p>A
Caper co-op in T-Dot? Can they form a loving relationship with a city that’s
been burned so many times before? Or will their First Time really be their Last
Time? You’ get to decide!</p>
<p>The
Toronto run of <b><i>First Time Last Time </i></b>is
June 10-21, 2015. We’re in <a href=""http://passemuraille.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Theatre Passe Muraille</a>’s Backspace, a terrific,
intimate space in one of Toronto’s most historic theatre venues. The Big Smokey
Collective is partnering with Aim for the Tangent Theatre, so
we’ve got some friends on the ground when we arrive. But we need help to
promote the play, so that Toronto audiences know what a rare opportunity
they’ve got.</p>
<p>Here’s
what we’ve already got covered (we’ve rounded these numbers off a bit to make
them easier to read, but donors can request a more detailed breakdown any
time!):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Rental
Costs: $3,000 including insurance.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Travel
Costs: $7,000 for gas, accommodations, and insurance on the road.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Production
Costs: $1,500 for set, costumes, props, and technical needs (Capers know how to
cut corners!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s
where <i>your </i>contributions will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Publicity
(Print) Costs: $1,500 for posters, handbills, and stickers.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Publicity
(Electronic) Costs: $800 for a comprehensive social media campaign.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Cost
Recovery: $300 to mail your gifts out to you in a timely fashion.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Per
Diems: $2,400 for three starving artists to sink their teeth into T.O.</li>
</ul>
<p>That
last point may sound frivolous, but it’s <i>all</i>
we’re expecting in terms of payment for this show. Our projected box office and
our other fundraising sources allow us to break even, but we’re not after
riches, we want to <i>get enriched</i>.
Those per diems will let us explore Toronto’s own arts scene, and to network
and create future partnerships with local artists. In short, your support will
help us to ensure that Big Smokey’s First Time is <i>not</i> our Last Time. <br/></p><p></p><h3>Perk Time Last Time<br/>
</h3>
<p>Because
our play is all about relationships, we’ve chosen perks which illustrate that
theme, and which help to bring us closer to our donors. If you pledge to
support us, you won’t just be helping to remount a play; you’ll be planting the
seeds for new relationships of all kinds – audiences and artists, business
partners for future productions, and friendships might just last a lifetime. <br/></p><p>But we also know that supporters like to get something tangible to remember us by. Take a look at the perk list on the right side of your screen to see what we're offering by way of thanks. Remember, no contribution is too small! </p><p>NOTE: If you're interested in donating $100 or more, but you don't live in Toronto or Sydney, send us a message and we'll find an alternative to complimentary tickets. Maybe we can convince a theatre company near you to toss some comps your way. Or we can mail you a gift certificate for your favourite artsy outlet. Help us help you help us!<br/></p>

<h3>Risk Time Last Time<br/>
</h3>One of our favourite quotes comes from Tom Stoppard's screenplay for <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>: the theatre business ""is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster."" Yet somehow, ""it all turns out well."" That has been our experience on innumerable previous productions -- even when disaster seems imminent, art conquers all!<br/><br/>However, if you are not a theatre practitioner, you might require some more concrete assurances before investing in our project. Here is why we are 100% confident that we can pull this off:<br/><ul>
<li>Between the three core collective members, we've had experience producing and performing in over 100 indie, community, and professional shows.</li>
<li>One of our team members (Wesley Colford) has produced numerous shows in Toronto before.</li>
<li>Another team member (Scott Sharplin) has toured shows all across Cape Breton, and once toured a show from Ottawa to Victoria without a hitch!<br/>
</li>
<li>Our production of <i>First Time Last Time</i> is all ready to go! The set, props, costumes, and tech have already been finalized.</li>
<li>We have community connections on the ground in Toronto, and at our halfway point (in Fredericton, NB), ready to help us out with billeting, postering, and generating buzz.<br/>
</li>
<li>By helping us raise publicity funds, you're doubling down on your investment, because more publicity dollars equals more tickets sold!<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Help Time Last Time<br/>
</h3> <p>Even if you don't have the funds to contribute to our campaign, you can still help us make the tour a success""<br/></p> <ul> <li>Spread the word! Use Indiegogo share tools to distribute buzz through social media. Or, if you have some dedicated theatre geeks in your contact list, shoot them an email about the campaign!<br/>
</li> <li>Visit our Facebook event page, and share share share!</li>
<li>Follow us on Twitter, and retweet retweet retweet (try saying that three times fast!).<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <p>No matter what you decide, THANK YOU for hearing us out, and for even being remotely interested in supporting indie Canadian theatre. You're amazing!</p><p>*Photos by Chris Walzak*<br/></p></div>","Is it Your First Time? We'll be Gentle...

(2013) and in the Fortress of Louisbourg’s musical comedy, A Recipe for Love (2013). He also has more than 20 years’ directing
experience, and he currently teaches playwriting and directing at Cape Breton
University.
For his play’s
Eastern Canadian premiere, Scott sought out two of the most talented and
versatile performers in Cape Breton: Wesley J. Colford (Ben) and Jenna Lahey
(Airlea). Wesley studied at Sheridan College and George Brown College. Since
then he has split his time between Sydney and Toronto, where he has worked
professionally and semi-professionally in a variety of disciplines with some of
Canada’s leading artists. Sydney audiences will recognize him from HAT’s
production of Punch Up, while Toronto
crowds associate him with the company he co-founded, Aim for the Tangent Theatre.
Jenna Lahey has
been an actor in Cape Breton since 2000, when she joined the Fortress of
Louisbourg’s Murder Mystery plays. In 2010, she began performing elsewhere in
the Cape Breton theatre scene, quickly becoming one of the busiest artists on
the island. Some of her favourite roles include Annie in Oklahoma! (Boardmore, 2011), Theresa in In the Valley (CBSC, 2013), Roxane in Cyrano de Bergerac (Boardmore, 2014), and Goneril in King Lear (Bandshell, 2014). She is the
recent winner of a Boardmore One-Act Festival award (Best Supporting Actress).
Together, these
artists formed the Big Smokey Collective, an artists’ co-op designed to bring
high-quality Cape Breton theatre to audiences off the island. First
Time Last Time is our first venture, and for a play that’s all about a
small-town kid finding love in the big city, where better to head than Toronto?
First Time Passe Time

A
Caper co-op in T-Dot? Can they form a loving relationship with a city that’s
been burned so many times before? Or will their First Time really be their Last
Time? You’ get to decide!
The
Toronto run of First Time Last Time is
June 10-21, 2015. We’re in Theatre Passe Muraille’s Backspace, a terrific,
intimate space in one of Toronto’s most historic theatre venues. The Big Smokey
Collective is partnering with Aim for the Tangent Theatre, so
we’ve got some friends on the ground when we arrive. But we need help to
promote the play, so that Toronto audiences know what a rare opportunity
they’ve got.
Here’s
what we’ve already got covered (we’ve rounded these numbers off a bit to make
them easier to read, but donors can request a more detailed breakdown any
time!):


Rental
Costs: $3,000 including insurance.

Travel
Costs: $7,000 for gas, accommodations, and insurance on the road.

Production
Costs: $1,500 for set, costumes, props, and technical needs (Capers know how to
cut corners!).

Here’s
where your contributions will go:


Publicity
(Print) Costs: $1,500 for posters, handbills, and stickers.

Publicity
(Electronic) Costs: $800 for a comprehensive social media campaign.

Cost
Recovery: $300 to mail your gifts out to you in a timely fashion.

Per
Diems: $2,400 for three starving artists to sink their teeth into T.O.

That
last point may sound frivolous, but it’s all
we’re expecting in terms of payment for this show. Our projected box office and
our other fundraising sources allow us to break even, but we’re not after
riches, we want to get enriched.
Those per diems will let us explore Toronto’s own arts scene, and to network
and create future partnerships with local artists. In short, your support will
help us to ensure that Big Smokey’s First Time is not our Last Time. Perk Time Last Time

Because
our play is all about relationships, we’ve chosen perks which illustrate that
theme, and which help to bring us closer to our donors. If you pledge to
support us, you won’t just be helping to remount a play; you’ll be planting the
seeds for new relationships of all kinds – audiences and artists, business
partners for future productions, and friendships might just last a lifetime. But we also know that supporters like to get something tangible to remember us by. Take a look at the perk list on the right side of your screen to see what we're offering by way of thanks. Remember, no contribution is too small! NOTE: If you're interested in donating $100 or more, but you don't live in Toronto or Sydney, send us a message and we'll find an alternative to complimentary tickets. Maybe we can convince a theatre company near you to toss some comps your way. Or we can mail you a gift certificate for your favourite artsy outlet. Help us help you help us!

Risk Time Last Time
One of our favourite quotes comes from Tom Stoppard's screenplay for Shakespeare in Love: the theatre business ""is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster."" Yet somehow, ""it all turns out well."" That has been our experience on innumerable previous productions -- even when disaster seems imminent, art conquers all!However, if you are not a theatre practitioner, you might require some more concrete assurances before investing in our project. Here is why we are 100% confident that we can pull this off:
Between the three core collective members, we've had experience producing and performing in over 100 indie, community, and professional shows.
One of our team members (Wesley Colford) has produced numerous shows in Toronto before.
Another team member (Scott Sharplin) has toured shows all across Cape Breton, and once toured a show from Ottawa to Victoria without a hitch!

Our production of First Time Last Time is all ready to go! The set, props, costumes, and tech have already been finalized.
We have community connections on the ground in Toronto, and at our halfway point (in Fredericton, NB), ready to help us out with billeting, postering, and generating buzz.

By helping us raise publicity funds, you're doubling down on your investment, because more publicity dollars equals more tickets sold!
    Help Time Last Time
 Even if you don't have the funds to contribute to our campaign, you can still help us make the tour a success""  Spread the word! Use Indiegogo share tools to distribute buzz through social media. Or, if you have some dedicated theatre geeks in your contact list, shoot them an email about the campaign!
 Visit our Facebook event page, and share share share!
Follow us on Twitter, and retweet retweet retweet (try saying that three times fast!).

<p>Hi there!  We are
MOD Theatre Company.  We’re a NYC
based non-profit theatre company dedicated to bringing the classics to life on
stage with artistic vision and prowess. We want everyone from grade-schoolers
to the well-seasoned theater goer to fall in love (or back in love) with the
greatest literary and theatrical works of all time. We are currently raising
funds for our flagship production: MOD Theatre's adaptation of Charles Dickens ghostly classic “A
Christmas Carol” which will run this season from Dec.16-Dec. 23 at the Clurman
Theater on Theatre Row in NYC.  The rest of our season includes our adaptations of Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" and Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein.""</p>
<p><b><i>Why Do You Care?</i></b></p>
<p>Because the classics are amazing, that’s why!!!  Not only are they the gateways into the minds
of the most enlightened men and women in history, true classics contain themes
that are universally applicable, stories that are unquestionably captivating,
and characters that are multi-layered and infinitely interpretable.  Perhaps more importantly, classic literature
has the power to make us ask the deep questions that help us become better
humans.  As such, classics are incubators
for great theatre.  Charles Dickens “A Christmas
Carol” is a well-beloved example of these ideals and an obvious first choice
for our company. </p>
<p><b><i>Why Should I Care?</i></b></p>
<p>Because it’s going to be awesome and you don’t want to miss
it!  You want to be totally deep and
impress those around you with your knowledge of classic texts, right?  You want to see amazing theatrical adaptations
that make you laugh, cry, and question yes?  Then you
definitely want to see “A Christmas Carol” off-Broadway this season because it
will literally make your Christmas! In all sincerity, our production is deeply
creative, deeply moving, and definitely not to be missed.</p><p><b><i>What If I Think You Guys Sound Really Great But I Don’t Want To Give
You My Money Because I Don’t Live In NYC And I’m Nice But I’m Not So Nice That
I Would Give My Money To A Show That I’m Not Even Going To Get To See?</i></b></p>
<p>Well, if you think we’re great but you don’t want to give us
your money because you don’t live in NYC and you’re nice but you’re not so nice
that you would give your money to a show that you’re not even going to get to see,
you’re in luck!  <u>We’re taking our
shows on the road!!</u>  That’s right!
The mission of our company is not limited to NYC.  In phase 2 for MOD Theatre, we will be taking
productions, like  “A Christmas Carol” in
NYC, and bring them to your hometown ASAP. 
Though the majority of us have been in the City long enough to call
ourselves New Yorkers, we hail from Utah, Idaho, Florida, Virginia and
everywhere in between.  We want to give
back to the communities that gave us so much by bringing them professional New
York theatre that is culturally relevant and family affordable.  Theatre doesn’t happen in a vacuum and if we
kept our excitement in New York that would suck!</p>
<p><b><i>Well, if MOD Is So Community Minded Then Why Don’t You Just Do Shows
Out Here To Begin With?</i></b></p>
<p>Ok, we will!  Seriously.
In phase 3 of our plan, we will bring the experience of creating a show out to communities
across the country, giving students of theatre and the arts opportunities that
are often available only in New York.  We
plan to: build, perform, and adapt new productions with local colleges, cast
local students and actors in our shows, and then bring them to NYC to be in the
Off-Broadway premiere of that production. </p><p>As artists and educators we know how
difficult the transition into the “real world” can be. We want be a
stepping-stone for students and young performers by giving them the tools,
training, and opportunities they need to begin building a successful
career. </p>
<p><b><i>So What Do You Need From Me?</i></b></p>
<p>Glad you asked! We need to raise $22,500 through this campaign to cover capital costs for theater rental, costumes, sound, scenery, props, lighting, a small stipend for our actors.  If possible, we hope to exceed that amount to enhance our already extremely tight budget and start moving on phase 2 and 3 of our mission right away!  </p><p>In short we need your support.  Our Company is important
to you, to us, and to our communities.

Christmas, and home in your town soon!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Are you looking for end of year tax deductions?  Contact MOD Theatre Company at

</div>","Help support a production of Albert Camus' The Just in Spring/Summer 2016. In December 2014 I first encountered Albert Camus' The Just.Deeply moved, I initiated conversations with friends in the theater community, and everyone I approached was as moved and excited by the play as I.  Good sign. I resolved to see the play produced. As I began closely exploring the text I had serious problems with the existing English translations. I began work on translating the play myself, and approached actors to explore, develop and refine the new text. On October 19th these actors will present the new translation to an audience in a minimally staged script-in-hand performance at 1FiftyOne Gallery. And in 2016 I intend to produce the play for a full public run. So, About That Full Run: 
This campaign will make that production happen!  Your contribution to will ensure our ability to:

<p><b>Rachael Otto </b></p>
<p><i>Project Manager, Vision founder</i></p>
<p>Founder of Wild Echoes a Sacred Phoenix event.<br/>Artist, Graphic Designer and Community arts worker. Her experience working in a multitude of community organisations for many years, developing arts projects and creating resources that raise awareness and create opportunities has set the perfect foundation for 'Sacred Phoenix' an emerging business that will host visionaries, support creative collaborations with community and focus on social action.</p>
<p>Through experiencing Sacred Dance via <i>Holly Wodetski's</i> incredible workshops and seeing <i>Zola</i> online I discovered how dance is a profoundly uplifting, expressive and healing journey. At a time in my life of massive change, transformations in body and spirit, dancing was exactly what I needed on my new journey through motherhood. I discovered how important it is to reconnect to your heart and free yourself of social constrictions or expectations and follow your instincts. Dance allows us this primal expression and release, connecting with our body in a profound way that is uniquely empowering and transformational. </p>
<p><b><i>Zola and I have a shared vision to reach out to women in the community and from services such as domestic violence, sexual assault, homeless, &amp; refugee<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> and offer a sacred dance project that helps these women heal from trauma.</span></i></b></p>

<p><i>Sacred Artist</i><br/></p>
<p>An international dance artist, traveller, performer and teacher, Zola’s love for dance led her to study with masters around the world. <br/></p>
<p>In addition to Zola’s training in mystical dance arts of the world, her study of various healing techniques and her work with women healing from sexual trauma havs given her insight into the relationship between dance and sacred tradition and healing. <br/></p>

<p>(limit: 30)</p>When: Friday 11 December 2015, 7-9pm <br/>Where: VIDA Dance Studios, 474 Ipswich Road, Annerley <br/><br/>Sacred Dance uniquely approaches the energetic, devotional and spiritual practice of dance within the shapes of belly dance and Indian temple dance united with tantric yoga and awareness of the heart. We take a feminine approach of accepting the invitation of the physical body to enter the present moment. Since our physical body is always here and now and only the mind can dwell in the past and future, as we drop deeper into our bodies, expanding our awareness there, we naturally become more present, spontaneous and connected with what is. This class will provide the philosophy and experiential practice required to enter a state of gracious authentic movement that is centred around surrender into dance itself. Where the individual is no longer dancing and the dancing is simply happening…unfolding moment to moment from the heart. Sacred Dance incorporates yogic practices for relaxing the mind and becoming deeply aware of the physical body, belly dance technique for opening and energizing the chakras, and guided free dance to surrender, fall in love and embrace the magical unity of dancing with no mind. <br/><br/><b>Come join us in awakening the dance in your heart!</b><br/><br/>About: <br/><br/>Holly Wodetzki, dance teacher and performer of Sacred Dance is passionate about awakening the feminine nature and embodying it in an artistic expression of love, grace and beauty. She is immensely grateful to have trained extensively worldwide in belly dance, classical Indian temple dance, Mystical dance, left and right hand tantric yoga, and meditation with many beloved teachers over the last 10 years. She wholeheartedly hopes to offer back to the world and share with others, the same joy and wisdom it shares with her. She believes in the power of dance with all her heart, and prays her experience and offering of Sacred Dance will also enrich and enliven the hearts of women everywhere to reclaim and embody more kindness and love within and on this planet, for the benefit of all beings.<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">...........................................................................................................................................................</span><br/><p><b><i>2.</i></b></p>

The posture is open and uplifted, grounded with strong arms, graceful movements and body alignment.<br/><br/>Though it is a modern day dance the feeling is ancient and sacred; with vibrant costuming, music, movements and a strong connection between the dancers. <br/>Using powerful and graceful combinations (that draw from Sian’s own dance repertoire and the movement vocabulary of ATS®) we will dance as a tribe with this exciting and organic dance style. <br/><br/>In this workshop, attention will be given to exploring concepts of movement, as well as clear breakdown of technique and understanding of body mechanics that prevent injury and improve dance form. This workshop is accessible to all levels of dance experience.<br/><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.......................................................................................................................................................</span><br/></p>

<b>About</b><br/>Krystal Beazley, Sole Owner/Artist of photography and makeup service APPLEJACK EFFECTZ founded in 2007 and based in Brisbane, QLD, Australia.  <br/><br/>In a nutshell...<br/>Growing up, I would use art as an outlet to get out of my own head and to find a place of escape and solitude. My whole world changed when I was able to clearly see and feel the benefits of expression through art and how it could potentially empower others also.  Such a profound realization!  <br/><br/>As a result,  AppleJack Effectz offer a unique experience that embraces the power of self exploration, embodiment, transformation, healing and growth through being creative.  <br/><br/>I have come to strongly understand the importance of doing what feels good, even if you don't understand it.  For me, it is taking photos and sharing a creative journey with others.  Allowing others the same opportunity to explore the peace in discovering something beautiful, which often lies within them!<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AppleJack-Effectz-185769758200177/timeline/?__mref=message_bubble"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/AppleJack-Effectz-185769758200177/timeline/</a><br/><br/><a href=""http://ajeffectx.wix.com/applejackeffectz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ajeffectx.wix.com/applejackeffectz</a><br/>

About Us
Rachael Otto 
Project Manager, Vision founder
Founder of Wild Echoes a Sacred Phoenix event.Artist, Graphic Designer and Community arts worker. Her experience working in a multitude of community organisations for many years, developing arts projects and creating resources that raise awareness and create opportunities has set the perfect foundation for 'Sacred Phoenix' an emerging business that will host visionaries, support creative collaborations with community and focus on social action.
Through experiencing Sacred Dance via Holly Wodetski's incredible workshops and seeing Zola online I discovered how dance is a profoundly uplifting, expressive and healing journey. At a time in my life of massive change, transformations in body and spirit, dancing was exactly what I needed on my new journey through motherhood. I discovered how important it is to reconnect to your heart and free yourself of social constrictions or expectations and follow your instincts. Dance allows us this primal expression and release, connecting with our body in a profound way that is uniquely empowering and transformational. 
Zola and I have a shared vision to reach out to women in the community and from services such as domestic violence, sexual assault, homeless, & refugee and offer a sacred dance project that helps these women heal from trauma.
Zola Dubnikova

Unique Perks Available including:

1.
Workshops:
The Path of Feminine Embodiment - guided by Holly Wodetski


www.sacreddance.com.au

cost:$25
(limit: 30)When: Friday 11 December 2015, 7-9pm Where: VIDA Dance Studios, 474 Ipswich Road, Annerley Sacred Dance uniquely approaches the energetic, devotional and spiritual practice of dance within the shapes of belly dance and Indian temple dance united with tantric yoga and awareness of the heart. We take a feminine approach of accepting the invitation of the physical body to enter the present moment. Since our physical body is always here and now and only the mind can dwell in the past and future, as we drop deeper into our bodies, expanding our awareness there, we naturally become more present, spontaneous and connected with what is. This class will provide the philosophy and experiential practice required to enter a state of gracious authentic movement that is centred around surrender into dance itself. Where the individual is no longer dancing and the dancing is simply happening…unfolding moment to moment from the heart. Sacred Dance incorporates yogic practices for relaxing the mind and becoming deeply aware of the physical body, belly dance technique for opening and energizing the chakras, and guided free dance to surrender, fall in love and embrace the magical unity of dancing with no mind. Come join us in awakening the dance in your heart!About: Holly Wodetzki, dance teacher and performer of Sacred Dance is passionate about awakening the feminine nature and embodying it in an artistic expression of love, grace and beauty. She is immensely grateful to have trained extensively worldwide in belly dance, classical Indian temple dance, Mystical dance, left and right hand tantric yoga, and meditation with many beloved teachers over the last 10 years. She wholeheartedly hopes to offer back to the world and share with others, the same joy and wisdom it shares with her. She believes in the power of dance with all her heart, and prays her experience and offering of Sacred Dance will also enrich and enliven the hearts of women everywhere to reclaim and embody more kindness and love within and on this planet, for the benefit of all beings............................................................................................................................................................2.

Tribal Bellydance Taster with Siân Bhala 



www.opalesquedance.com/
When:  Thursday December 3rd. 6:30-8:30pmWhere:  The Danceworks – 19 Burke St Woolloongabba(Limit 20)Cost $25ATS® Tribal Bellydance is both earthy and artistic, blending the folkloric movements of the Middle East and India with the sinuous elegance of contemporary dance forms. The posture is open and uplifted, grounded with strong arms, graceful movements and body alignment.Though it is a modern day dance the feeling is ancient and sacred; with vibrant costuming, music, movements and a strong connection between the dancers. Using powerful and graceful combinations (that draw from Sian’s own dance repertoire and the movement vocabulary of ATS®) we will dance as a tribe with this exciting and organic dance style. In this workshop, attention will be given to exploring concepts of movement, as well as clear breakdown of technique and understanding of body mechanics that prevent injury and improve dance form. This workshop is accessible to all levels of dance experience........................................................................................................................................................

Founded in 2012 by multi-award-winning sopranos Jacqueline Ko and Robin Eder-Warren, Mariposa has quickly made a name for itself as one of the most dynamic companies on the local arts scene. Critics have hailed our performances as “a stroke of genius” (<a href=""http://www.langaravoice.ca/2012/04/02/new-vancouver-opera-company-performs-in-marpole/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Voice</a>), “an evening of delight” and “a masterpiece” (<a href=""http://www.reviewvancouver.org/op_serva_padrone2013.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Review Vancouver</a>), with <a href=""http://glasscity.ca/2014/07/15/opera-mariposa-stands-forefront-vancouvers-opera-scene-video/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Vancouver Project</a> declaring, ""Opera Mariposa stands at the forefront of Vancouver's opera scene."" In the last three years our benefit shows have raised over $30,000 for charity, while our dedication to making opera accessible has led us to perform at street festivals, seniors’ residences, the Vancouver Public Library and more. No matter what, our mission is to create a stage for emerging talent, showcasing the most promising performers from the Lower Mainland and beyond in high-calibre shows that appeal to aficionados and new audiences alike.  </div><div>
<p></p>
<div> <h3>What is the Mariposa Theatre Wing?</h3> The Mariposa Theatre Wing is a new branch of Opera Mariposa that will present plays and musicals with operatic themes, styles or influences. Running in parallel with Opera Mariposa, MTW will allow us to explore great new shows and reach new audiences, while creating even more opportunities for the talented singers of the Pacific Northwest. MTW will officially launch in February 2016 with <b>Terrence McNally’s <i>Master Class</i></b> – a Tony Award-winning play where audiences and singers alike spend an evening with the legendary opera diva Maria Callas!  <p></p>
<div> <h3>Why do we need a fundraising campaign?</h3> <p> </p>We're thrilled to be conquering new territory with the Mariposa Theatre Wing – but to make MTW a success, we need your help. Compared to opera productions, plays and musicals have a lot of additional expenses. For example, most plays and musicals are still under copyright, so companies need to pay for performance rights and score rentals. Show runs are usually longer, which means higher costs for everything from venue rental to event insurance to program printing, and productions often have other associated needs (like sound equipment) that also demand budget increases. <p></p>
<div> <h3>What your money goes toward:</h3> <p></p>

<p>Your donation will go directly towards the budget for the Mariposa Theatre Wing’s debut production, <i>Master Class</i>. Our campaign goal of $5,000.00 will help us cover: </p>

It’s time for an <b>Audition Revolution!</b> The mission is simple - <b>save time, save money, help save the planet. </b>How? Pledge to go paperless, ditch the hardcopy headshot, and support AuditionAnswer. </p><p>AuditionAnswer is an online organizational solution for open casting calls. We save Casting Professionals valuable time by automating the audition flow and simplifying Performer sign in/group divisions. We save Performers money by eliminating the need for hardcopy headshots and resumes. We help save the planet by decreasing the amount of paper waste generated at large open calls. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461292604/That_s_where_we_come_in_1_sdhnql.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 522.282px;height: 294px;""/></p><p>The AuditionAnswer approach is more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally-friendly than current audition practices. With the support of Performers and Casting, AuditionAnswer will revolutionize audition protocol throughout the industry. </p><p><b>THE AUDITION GAME</b></p><p>AuditionAnswer conducted a survey of NYC Performers to better understand the life of a professional actor. Nervous, stressed, impatient, frantic. These were the most common words Performers used to describe their state of mind at open calls. </p><p>We found that Performers who audition at least once a week spend an average of $345/year on headshot printing services. This left Performers feeling “frustrated” and “annoyed” because, more often than not, auditioners don’t know where their headshots end up or if they are being considered for the job. </p><p>What about the people on the other side of the audition table? Casting Professionals are responsible forcollecting hundreds of headshots, organizing them into piles, answering Performer questions, and making split second decisions based on minute long dance routines and 16 bar cuts. </p><p>Of course every organization runs its auditions differently, but the general nature of open casting calls is chaotic, stressful, and overwhelming. Picture hundreds of Performers cramped in a small room, while an Audition Monitor fields questions, and the Casting Team is bombarded with headshots and resumes. Not as glamorous as you thought, huh? </p><p><b>HOW AUDITIONANSWER CHANGES THE GAME</b></p><p>AuditionAnswer streamlines the day-of-audition by automating the time-consuming tasks that bog down the audition flow. We are not a submission-based audition service and we are not a substitute for attending in-person auditions.</p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461291539/Screen_Shot_2016-04-21_at_10.18.17_PM_nrjm9i.png"" src="""" style=""width: 531px;height: 355px;""/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">That’s only the tip of the iceberg.

A typical open casting call at Pearl or Ripley Grier could easily attract 200 Performers. What happens to all those headshots and resumes once they leave the audition room? Are some stuffed into filing cabinets? Are others discarded? </p><p>Our impact might seem small in the grand scheme of global paper usage, but we can still make a huge difference.

After graduation, I had the pleasure of working with the amazingly talented staff at Ocean State Theatre in Rhode Island. </p><p>After moving to NYC and attending several open casting calls, I saw the need for a simpler, more efficient audition process and I began working on the solution. </p><p><b>FOR PERFORMERS</b></p><p><b>To learn more about how AuditionAnswer helps Performers check out our <a href=""http://www.auditionanswer.com/for-performers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.</b> Click <a href=""http://104.131.31.184/register"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a> to create your free profile - simply upload your headshot and resume to get started.

I know firsthand how much money Performers spend on dance shoes, voice lessons, dance classes, the perfect audition outfit, and professional headshots. </p><p>It’s a small price to pay for the opportunity to live your dreams and pursue your passions, but why not lessen the burden.

</div></div>","THE AUDITION REVOLUTIONAuditioning is hard, right? Let’s make it easier - together. It’s time for an Audition Revolution! The mission is simple - save time, save money, help save the planet. How? Pledge to go paperless, ditch the hardcopy headshot, and support AuditionAnswer. AuditionAnswer is an online organizational solution for open casting calls. We save Casting Professionals valuable time by automating the audition flow and simplifying Performer sign in/group divisions. We save Performers money by eliminating the need for hardcopy headshots and resumes. We help save the planet by decreasing the amount of paper waste generated at large open calls. The AuditionAnswer approach is more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally-friendly than current audition practices. With the support of Performers and Casting, AuditionAnswer will revolutionize audition protocol throughout the industry. THE AUDITION GAMEAuditionAnswer conducted a survey of NYC Performers to better understand the life of a professional actor. Nervous, stressed, impatient, frantic. These were the most common words Performers used to describe their state of mind at open calls. We found that Performers who audition at least once a week spend an average of $345/year on headshot printing services. This left Performers feeling “frustrated” and “annoyed” because, more often than not, auditioners don’t know where their headshots end up or if they are being considered for the job. What about the people on the other side of the audition table? Casting Professionals are responsible forcollecting hundreds of headshots, organizing them into piles, answering Performer questions, and making split second decisions based on minute long dance routines and 16 bar cuts. Of course every organization runs its auditions differently, but the general nature of open casting calls is chaotic, stressful, and overwhelming. Picture hundreds of Performers cramped in a small room, while an Audition Monitor fields questions, and the Casting Team is bombarded with headshots and resumes. Not as glamorous as you thought, huh? HOW AUDITIONANSWER CHANGES THE GAMEAuditionAnswer streamlines the day-of-audition by automating the time-consuming tasks that bog down the audition flow. We are not a submission-based audition service and we are not a substitute for attending in-person auditions.That’s only the tip of the iceberg. Although our current focus is open casting calls, we plan to tackle audition appointments, invited calls, and every other type of audition you can think of.With funds raised through this Indiegogo Campaign, we plan to enhance our current solution and begin developing subsequent audition flows. That’s where you come in!HOW YOU CAN HELPJust as theater is a collaborative art form, AuditionAnswer is a collaborative effort with Performers and Casting Professionals at the forefront. The project's success rests in your hands. Please support us and rally behind the Audition Revolution. Our goal is to raise $8,000 over the next 40 days. This money will be used for debugging, software enhancements, and marketing. We opted for flexible funding so we will receive the total amount funded, regardless of whether or not we reach our goal. In the event that we exceed our goal, the funds will be allocated to future enhancements and team building.  There are many ways you can help. Make a donation to our campaign and bring us one step closer to our goal. If you are unable to donate, spreading the word and sharing our campaign on social media is equally appreciated. Follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook. A third, and very important, way you can help is providing feedback, suggestions for enhancements, and signing up to be a Beta Tester. Designing an online audition solution is no small task and the only way we can create a solution that fits your needs is if you tell us your needs. Kindly contact us HERE with your feedback.AuditionAnswer is currently in Beta and being tested by industry professionals. If you’re a Casting Professional interested in checking out our software, click HERE to sign up for our Beta Test. This is only the beginning of our fundraising efforts, but it’s an important first step. The more eyes that see this page, the more likely we are to reach our goal! For more information, check out auditionanswer.com and read our blog. WHY NOW? If not now, when? Technology touches nearly every aspect of our lives - sending a text, calling an uber, ordering Seamless, “ordering” a date on Tinder. Why, then, is there no effective technological solution for in-person casting calls? As a younger generation of Performers and Casting Professionals break into the industry, we will see a shift in general practices and expectations. Millennials are in tune with technology — they expect things to happen quickly, efficiently, and electronically.The landscape is already changing - with Actors Equity Association announcing online sign ups for ECCs and several other companies seeking to improve and strengthen the theater industry through apps and tech. Bookster is changing the way Performers find, attend, and track auditions, while ScriptMatch is changing the way aspiring playwrights interact with directors and producers. The Artist Co-op is introducing a much needed shared workspace for performing artists in Central Manhattan. With all this innovation in the performing arts community, how could you say the time isn’t now? ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTAnother reason to incorporate technology and eliminate paper in the audition space is to decrease our carbon footprint. A typical open casting call at Pearl or Ripley Grier could easily attract 200 Performers. What happens to all those headshots and resumes once they leave the audition room? Are some stuffed into filing cabinets? Are others discarded? Our impact might seem small in the grand scheme of global paper usage, but we can still make a huge difference. We can be part of the solution by going paperless. Think of all the trees we’ll save!AuditionAnswer supports the amazing work being done at the Green Globe Theatre, an eco-friendly theatre company in Baltimore. Their mission is to cultivate an environment in which all aspects of design and production are renewable and sustainable. Support their vision and check out their​ GoFundMe. ABOUT THE FOUNDERHi - I’m Alexis and my career began at age 4 when I directed and choreographed my first musical, starring my mom and my sister. Yes, there is video evidence and no, they did not receive EMC points ; ) I graduated from Boston College with a B.A. in Communications and Theater Arts. After graduation, I had the pleasure of working with the amazingly talented staff at Ocean State Theatre in Rhode Island. After moving to NYC and attending several open casting calls, I saw the need for a simpler, more efficient audition process and I began working on the solution. FOR PERFORMERSTo learn more about how AuditionAnswer helps Performers check out our website. Click HERE to create your free profile - simply upload your headshot and resume to get started. The Standard Performer profile is (and always will be) free. In the not too distant future, we plan to introduce a Premium Performer profile with extra features and useful industry discounts. Our goal is to keep the Premium subscription fee as low as possible, so you get the most bang for your buck. At its core, AuditionAnswer is a movement to lessen the financial burden that Performers face in preparation for auditions. I know firsthand how much money Performers spend on dance shoes, voice lessons, dance classes, the perfect audition outfit, and professional headshots. It’s a small price to pay for the opportunity to live your dreams and pursue your passions, but why not lessen the burden. Yes, the elimination of the paper headshot and resume may seem like a minimal cost differential, but every little bit counts when you’re paying NYC rent. If you’re ready to bring auditions into the 21st Century, then strap on those LaDuca’s and join the Audition Revolution!If every Performer that sees this page donates just $5, we’ll be one step closer to our goal.What should AuditionAnswer’s first enhancement be?

<p><b>The Shakespeare in Puglia Project: Measure for Measure  </b></p>
<p>This October we will be touring an adaptation of 'Measure for Measure' in London and Puglia, Italy.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The tour (5th-19th October) will therefore have three important aims.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>10 performances of Measure for Measure in
theatres and spaces across Puglia</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Using the play as inspiration we will lead
Shakespeare and theatre workshops for local schools and communities, working
with aspiring actors young and old.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Working with theatre companies in Puglia to develop
new projects inspired by each other’s culture, with the aim of collaborating in
the future.</p>
<p>Our retelling of Shakespeare's classic problem play is set in a world in post-apocalyptic chaos, threatened by disease and disorder, where the pimps speak reason and the politicians breed fear.  The Duke has a plan to restore it, but it may come at a severe cost.</p>
<p>This will be our biggest challenge yet as we involve the audience and bring the drama to life taking them on a journey of Vienna under the rule of evangelical fascism.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Shakespeare
in Puglia </b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Progetto:
Measure for Measure</b></p>
<p>Il prossimo ottobre porteremo in tour un
adattamento di 'Measure for Measure' a Londra e in Puglia.</p>
<p>Il tour (5-19 OTTOBRE) avrà quindi tre
obiettivi importanti:</p>
<p>· 10 spettacoli nei teatri e luoghi della
Puglia</p>
<p>· Usando il Teatro come ispirazione, porteremo
Shakespeare in laboratori teatrali per scuole e comunità locali che lavorano
con aspiranti attori giovani e meno giovani.</p>
<p>· Lavorare con associazioni e compagnie
teatrali in Puglia per sviluppare nuovi progetti ispirati alla cultura di
ciascuno, con l'obiettivo di una collaborazione duratura.</p>
<p>La nostra rivisitazione del classico di
Shakespeare è ambientata in un mondo nel caos post-apocalittico, minacciata
dalla malattia e governata dal disordine, dove i protettori parlano di ragione
ed i politici di razza e paura. Il Duca ha un piano per il ripristino, ma può
avvenire solo con gravi conseguenze.</p>
<p>La sfida più grande sarà ancora una volta
quella di riuscire al meglio nel coinvolgimento di un pubblico di un’altra
lingua nella rappresentazione del dramma della vita shakespeariano attraverso
un viaggio nella Vienna sotto il dominio del fascismo evangelista.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The new Measure for Measure project is the latest in a series of reimagined Shakespeare texts that the company members have been involved in.<br/></p>
<p>In 2014 we staged King Lear under old company name 'Without Walls Theatre Company' an adaptation which focused on the generational divide within families during the emigration of Italians into America in the 1920s.  This marked a second outing for many Quite Right's members after Romeo y Giulieta in 2012 with company 'By Any Other Name', and we have been blown away by the audience's reaction.  </p>
<p>This year we will be combining modern theatre techniques with the classical text, keeping the original language intact to provide audiences with a production never before realised but that can be enjoyed by audiences regardless of language or age.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>LE PASSATE EDIZIONI</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>'Measure for Measure' è solo l'ultimo di una
serie di testi di Shakespeare rielaborati per la Puglia, in cui i membri della
compagnia sono stati coinvolti.</p>
<p>Nel 2014 è stato portato in scena
'Re Lear' sotto il vecchio nome della società ' Without Walls Theatre Company
'. Un riadattamento incentrato sul divario generazionale all'interno delle
famiglie mafiose americane durante l'emigrazione degli italiani negli anni ‘20.
</p>
<p>Questa fu, per molti del cast, la seconda
esperienza dopo 'Romeo e Giulietta' portato in scena in Puglia nel 2012 con la
compagnia ' With Any Other Name '.  </p>
<p>E siamo sempre rimasti spiazzati dalla
reazione del pubblico.</p>
<p>Quest'anno gli spettacoli avverranno
combinando tecniche teatrali moderne con il testo classico , mantenendo la
lingua originale intatta per fornire al pubblico una produzione mai realizzata,
ma che può essere goduta indipendentemente dalla lingua o dall'età .</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>How can you help us make this happen?</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our work is about connecting with new audiences in communities everywhere and we do this out of a labour of love, not money.  Our team of 10 is made up of people who simply love staging theatre that moves and entertains people. </div>
<div>
<br/><p>To make this production happen, to realise this incredibly exciting project, we need your help.  We are asking for a donation towards our production costs that are all based on the lowest possible budget that we could generate. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The total cost of the project, based on the <b>tightest budget</b>, will be a little over £5,000.  This <b>excludes</b> all costs associated with our 3 week rehearsal period. </p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We will<b> not</b> make any money from this production.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is broken down into;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>£1300 for travel. This will be for budget flights to Italy for 10 company members, &amp; cost of transporting props/costumes</div>
<div> </div>
<div>£1000 for van hire for 2 weeks between performance venues around the region.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>£1000 for self-catering.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>£1100 for Airbnb rented accommodation for 2 weeks in Puglia.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>£200 for publicity (posters, flyers, social media campaign, programmes)<br/>

<p>Per realizzare questa produzione abbiamo

<p>Chiediamo una donazione per i costi di
produzione che sono tutti basati sul bilancio più basso possibile che si possa

 Our Mission
We are a company that prides itself on creating and adapting works that transcend language barriers, making accessible and engaging theatre for a universal audience.
Our goal is to establish a European theatre network which will see Shakespeare's plays performed in places where they aren't traditionally shown, while collaborating with theatre makers across Europe to create new innovative work.
There is so much potential to develop a wide and expansive theatre network and this is our first big step in achieving this.



La nostra missione
Siamo una compagnia che si vanta di creare e
adattare le opere che trascendono le barriere linguistiche, fare teatro
accessibile e coinvolgente per un pubblico universale.
Il nostro obiettivo è quello di creare una
rete europea di teatro che vedrà opere di Shakespeare eseguite in luoghi dove
non lo sono tradizionalmente, collaborando con i responsabili del teatro in
tutta Europa per creare lavoro innovativo.
C'è tanto potenziale per sviluppare una rete
di teatro ampia ed espansiva, e questo è il nostro primo grande passo per
raggiungere questo obiettivo.

                                            

The Shakespeare in Puglia Project: Measure for Measure  
This October we will be touring an adaptation of 'Measure for Measure' in London and Puglia, Italy.


The tour (5th-19th October) will therefore have three important aims.
· 
10 performances of Measure for Measure in
theatres and spaces across Puglia
· 
Using the play as inspiration we will lead
Shakespeare and theatre workshops for local schools and communities, working
with aspiring actors young and old.
· 
Working with theatre companies in Puglia to develop
new projects inspired by each other’s culture, with the aim of collaborating in
the future.
Our retelling of Shakespeare's classic problem play is set in a world in post-apocalyptic chaos, threatened by disease and disorder, where the pimps speak reason and the politicians breed fear.  The Duke has a plan to restore it, but it may come at a severe cost.
This will be our biggest challenge yet as we involve the audience and bring the drama to life taking them on a journey of Vienna under the rule of evangelical fascism.



Shakespeare
in Puglia Progetto:
Measure for Measure
Il prossimo ottobre porteremo in tour un
adattamento di 'Measure for Measure' a Londra e in Puglia.
Il tour (5-19 OTTOBRE) avrà quindi tre
obiettivi importanti:
· 10 spettacoli nei teatri e luoghi della
Puglia
· Usando il Teatro come ispirazione, porteremo
Shakespeare in laboratori teatrali per scuole e comunità locali che lavorano
con aspiranti attori giovani e meno giovani.
· Lavorare con associazioni e compagnie
teatrali in Puglia per sviluppare nuovi progetti ispirati alla cultura di
ciascuno, con l'obiettivo di una collaborazione duratura.
La nostra rivisitazione del classico di
Shakespeare è ambientata in un mondo nel caos post-apocalittico, minacciata
dalla malattia e governata dal disordine, dove i protettori parlano di ragione
ed i politici di razza e paura. Il Duca ha un piano per il ripristino, ma può
avvenire solo con gravi conseguenze.
La sfida più grande sarà ancora una volta
quella di riuscire al meglio nel coinvolgimento di un pubblico di un’altra
lingua nella rappresentazione del dramma della vita shakespeariano attraverso
un viaggio nella Vienna sotto il dominio del fascismo evangelista.

We aren't new to this

                           

The new Measure for Measure project is the latest in a series of reimagined Shakespeare texts that the company members have been involved in.
In 2014 we staged King Lear under old company name 'Without Walls Theatre Company' an adaptation which focused on the generational divide within families during the emigration of Italians into America in the 1920s.  This marked a second outing for many Quite Right's members after Romeo y Giulieta in 2012 with company 'By Any Other Name', and we have been blown away by the audience's reaction.  
This year we will be combining modern theatre techniques with the classical text, keeping the original language intact to provide audiences with a production never before realised but that can be enjoyed by audiences regardless of language or age.



LE PASSATE EDIZIONI



'Measure for Measure' è solo l'ultimo di una
serie di testi di Shakespeare rielaborati per la Puglia, in cui i membri della
compagnia sono stati coinvolti.
Nel 2014 è stato portato in scena
'Re Lear' sotto il vecchio nome della società ' Without Walls Theatre Company
'. Un riadattamento incentrato sul divario generazionale all'interno delle
famiglie mafiose americane durante l'emigrazione degli italiani negli anni ‘20.

Questa fu, per molti del cast, la seconda
esperienza dopo 'Romeo e Giulietta' portato in scena in Puglia nel 2012 con la
compagnia ' With Any Other Name '.  
E siamo sempre rimasti spiazzati dalla
reazione del pubblico.
Quest'anno gli spettacoli avverranno
combinando tecniche teatrali moderne con il testo classico , mantenendo la
lingua originale intatta per fornire al pubblico una produzione mai realizzata,
ma che può essere goduta indipendentemente dalla lingua o dall'età .
   How can you help us make this happen?

Our work is about connecting with new audiences in communities everywhere and we do this out of a labour of love, not money.  Our team of 10 is made up of people who simply love staging theatre that moves and entertains people. 

To make this production happen, to realise this incredibly exciting project, we need your help.  We are asking for a donation towards our production costs that are all based on the lowest possible budget that we could generate. 

The total cost of the project, based on the tightest budget, will be a little over £5,000.  This excludes all costs associated with our 3 week rehearsal period. 


We will not make any money from this production.  

This is broken down into;

£1300 for travel. This will be for budget flights to Italy for 10 company members, & cost of transporting props/costumes
 
£1000 for van hire for 2 weeks between performance venues around the region.

£1000 for self-catering.

£1100 for Airbnb rented accommodation for 2 weeks in Puglia.

£200 for publicity (posters, flyers, social media campaign, programmes)


£400 for costume/props/set.  


Come potete aiutarci perché questo accada?

Il nostro lavoro si basa sul collegamento con
un nuovo pubblico nelle comunità e si tratta di un lavoro d'amore, non per
denaro. Il nostro team è composto da 10 persone che amano il teatro che si
muove e si diverte.
Per realizzare questa produzione abbiamo
bisogno del vostro aiuto. 
Chiediamo una donazione per i costi di
produzione che sono tutti basati sul bilancio più basso possibile che si possa
generare.
Il costo totale del progetto, basato su un
budget ristretto, sarà poco più di £ 5.000. Sono esclusi tutti i costi
associati al periodo di prove di tre settimane.
Non guadagneremo soldi da questa produzione.
I costi sono suddivisi in;
£ 1.300 per il viaggio. Comprende i voli per
l'Italia per 10 membri della compagnia, e spese di trasporto strumenti /
costumi
£ 1000 per il furgone a noleggio per il
periodo di 2 settimane in giro per la regione.
£ 1.000 per il cibo.
£ 1.100 per un alloggio di due 2 settimane in
Puglia.
200 sterline per la pubblicità (manifesti,
volantini, campagna sui social media, programmi)
£ 400 per costume / puntelli / set.

<h3>Our Project:</h3> <p>The Performers Ballet and Jazz Company is a non-profit arts organization founded by Karen Alwin in 1981.  Our mission is to provide excellent pre-professional training, education, and outstanding performance opportunities to young dancers (age 8 - 18), and to offer high quality dance entertainment to its community.</p>
<p>Our Eternal Elegance Fund was created to honor the late Ms. Edna Nation.  She was not only the mother of Ms. Karen Alwin, she also played a vital role in The Performers' performance opportunities.  In particular, she had an artistic eye and a vision for excellence in beautifying each production.  She strived to make sure our dancers had the props and costumes they needed to catch the eye of the audience and exude the emotion of the dances.  </p>
<p>This fund allows us to create new pieces and beautify those pieces with amazing costumes and props.  A beautiful example of this fund 'at work' is our newest piece, On Our Knees, featured for the first time during our 2014 production of Christmas Joy.  Pictures of this number are highlighted in the Gallery Tab.  </p>
<p>We continually need funds to add new pieces to our repertoire of current numbers and to replace/update costumes and props.  The costs associated with doing this is astounding!  An average new piece costs approximately $4,300.  That's an average based on 10 dancers in a new piece.  </p>

<p><b>Testimonials:</b></p>
<p><b>""It has been a beautiful and unique privilege to journey the ""Christmas Joy"" story for the past 30 years.  To have been part of the early creation of the production and involved still 30 years later is a true blessing in my life.  The dancers that I have had the opportunity to work with, create on and mentor over these decades have been a true delight for me.  Many of them now are colleagues and dear friends in my own life which is such a testament to the rich history in our ""Chrismas Joy"" experience.   It has become a loving collaborative between dancers and their faith, and an opportunity to speak silently the profound story of the birth of Christ.  <br/>     The production has grown, matured and changed over the past 30 years and yet it has been exciting to see the rich traditions preserved in ways to honor the history of the creation of Christmas Joy.   The profound commitment from Karen Alwin, the Performers Ballet and Jazz Co. Board and the new artistic leader Wendy Miner to bring this production to the audiences every year is an impressive achievement and a act of faith each year to follow this mission.  The numbers of young dancers who have journeyed through the ""Christmas Joy"" experience is an example of the fruit of this ministry. The experience not only touches and grows the heart of an audience member but each little heart out on that stage each year is given the opportunity to pour their passion into telling the story of Gods love.   Their faith is challenged and grown in the process.  Story after story of lives that were changed through this experience.  Brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it.  And the sweet legacy of dancers that Karen and I trained way back when, bringing their beautiful little children to participate in Christmas Joy.  The history is rich. The history is full of love.  <br/>   It's a very special production. It is about faith.  It is upheld and maintained by faith. By the strong power of prayer and by very extraordinary people working very hard to fulfill the purpose God has given them to share. It is a privilege to be a part of it and to share in the mission.  Come share in the ""Joy"" this Christmas.""         </b><b><br/></b></p>

</div></div>","Our Project: The Performers Ballet and Jazz Company is a non-profit arts organization founded by Karen Alwin in 1981.  Our mission is to provide excellent pre-professional training, education, and outstanding performance opportunities to young dancers (age 8 - 18), and to offer high quality dance entertainment to its community.
Our Eternal Elegance Fund was created to honor the late Ms. Edna Nation.  She was not only the mother of Ms. Karen Alwin, she also played a vital role in The Performers' performance opportunities.  In particular, she had an artistic eye and a vision for excellence in beautifying each production.  She strived to make sure our dancers had the props and costumes they needed to catch the eye of the audience and exude the emotion of the dances.  
This fund allows us to create new pieces and beautify those pieces with amazing costumes and props.  A beautiful example of this fund 'at work' is our newest piece, On Our Knees, featured for the first time during our 2014 production of Christmas Joy.  Pictures of this number are highlighted in the Gallery Tab.  
We continually need funds to add new pieces to our repertoire of current numbers and to replace/update costumes and props.  The costs associated with doing this is astounding!  An average new piece costs approximately $4,300.  That's an average based on 10 dancers in a new piece.  

 What You Get:
We are offering a variety of fun and valuable incentives for your donation.  We truly appreciate your support of The Performers Ballet and Jazz Company!
 The Impact: Christmas Joy 2015 will be our 31st production of the show and How Love Wins 2016 will be in its 3rd year of production.  We strive to keep the shows fresh and up to date while preserving the beauty of classical ballet and the spirit of jazz dance.  By contributing to our cause, you will be supporting these dancers in their dance education and in their pursuit of providing a beautiful, novel, and emotional experience to their audience.   Challenges:
  The Performers Ballet and Jazz Company rely on dues, sponsorships, fundraising, and donations to bring to life their two primary productions:  Christmas Joy and How Love Wins.  Without the generosity of people like you, we would not survive.  Your donation will make a very positive impact on these young dancers.  It will allow them the ability to express themselves in new ways through the art of dance.  
Testimonials:
""It has been a beautiful and unique privilege to journey the ""Christmas Joy"" story for the past 30 years.  To have been part of the early creation of the production and involved still 30 years later is a true blessing in my life.  The dancers that I have had the opportunity to work with, create on and mentor over these decades have been a true delight for me.  Many of them now are colleagues and dear friends in my own life which is such a testament to the rich history in our ""Chrismas Joy"" experience.   It has become a loving collaborative between dancers and their faith, and an opportunity to speak silently the profound story of the birth of Christ.       The production has grown, matured and changed over the past 30 years and yet it has been exciting to see the rich traditions preserved in ways to honor the history of the creation of Christmas Joy.   The profound commitment from Karen Alwin, the Performers Ballet and Jazz Co. Board and the new artistic leader Wendy Miner to bring this production to the audiences every year is an impressive achievement and a act of faith each year to follow this mission.  The numbers of young dancers who have journeyed through the ""Christmas Joy"" experience is an example of the fruit of this ministry. The experience not only touches and grows the heart of an audience member but each little heart out on that stage each year is given the opportunity to pour their passion into telling the story of Gods love.   Their faith is challenged and grown in the process.  Story after story of lives that were changed through this experience.  Brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it.  And the sweet legacy of dancers that Karen and I trained way back when, bringing their beautiful little children to participate in Christmas Joy.  The history is rich. The history is full of love.     It's a very special production. It is about faith.  It is upheld and maintained by faith. By the strong power of prayer and by very extraordinary people working very hard to fulfill the purpose God has given them to share. It is a privilege to be a part of it and to share in the mission.  Come share in the ""Joy"" this Christmas.""         
~Lynn Cox, Founding Choreographer



""My daughter Rachel has been a Performer for nine years now.  It has been a wonderful experience that has really helped her to grow in her dancing, confidence and stage presence.  She has also made many good friends in the company.  It is like a second family.""

~Anne Jones, mother of Rachel Jones 
""I have had the wonderful privilege of being a part of ""The Performers"" family for 16 years.  Throughout my time with this group I was inspired by the commitment to excellence - whether it be in the quality of the dancing, the gorgeous choreography or the exquisite costuming.  Nothing ""The Performers"" produced was anything less than 'excellent'.  When the curtain goes up on a ""Performers"" production, I am certain of one thing - I am about to be entertained by a performance of the highest quality.  Ms. Edna Nation had more than just an eye for lovely costumes.  Ms. Nation saw what could be beautiful in every aspect of ""The Performers"" productions and saw to it that her visions were achieved.  To this day, Ms. Nation's call to excellence is in the heart and mind of every person her life touched.  She is missed but her legacy of beauty and excellence lives on.""

Ms. Edna Nation with McKee's~Denise McKee,  mother of Cassidy McKee 

""Wow, I can’t imagine what path my career would have taken if I hadn’t had the exposure to dance and performing that this company gave me. It truly was one of the best things that I could have had as a young student dreaming to become a professional dancer. A youth dance company lead by such amazing teachers, mentors, and organizers is hard to come by. Ms. Karen and Ms. Lynn made sure we carried the discipline, respect, and dedication we needed to accomplish great things, and Ms. Nation made sure we did it with class.  I will never forget the mark that these women have made on my life. They gave us the exposure and skills needed to embark on a dance career and I continue to feel supported by these ladies on a daily basis 30 years later. Amazing! I can’t thank The Performers and my mentors enough for preparing me in such a supportive, encouraging, and well rounded way. I am forever grateful and I will continue to hold Ms. Nations’ spirit close to heart. I think the Eternal Elegance Fund is a perfect way to continue to honor her and all that she has done for us!""

<p>The Wayne Densch Performing Arts Center in Sanford, Florida,
formerly known as the Ritz Theater, is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit
organization that has fully restored and operates a historic theater that was first opened in 1923.  Unlike some organizations, WDPAC provides the
opportunity for performers to appear onstage without the payment of dues or any other
cost.  At the community theater level, we
have taken on some projects that other theaters our size have avoided – shows
such as “Les Miserables”, “Miss Saigon” and “The Mystery of Edwin Drood”.  Each production utilizes a live orchestra; we
do not use canned music, as we want the shows to retain their authenticity.  The theater, which seats over 500, is a significant economic driver in the community.</p>
<p>In our continuing efforts to do more – both for our immediate community
and for the larger Central Florida theater community – we will be the first Florida community theater to stage “Bring It On: The Musical”. 
As the rights for this show have only recently become available, we are
looking for this debut show to serve as an outreach to the “next” generation of
theatergoers – to show them that musicals are and can be relevant for
them.  We hope that by staging shows like
this one that we will be able to instill a love of theater in people who
haven’t previously experienced the power of theater. 
</p>
<p>This is where you come in. 
We have the opportunity to use the original costumes from the professional production of “Bring It On: The Musical”, but the cost to do so is something that
exceeds our minimal production budget. 
Although we will continue to utilize the talents of a live orchestra, we
want to make sure that for the premiere performance of this show that we are
able to make this production truly spectacular. 
We believe that if we are able to do this, we will be able to keep this
show “real” and authentic.  Please help
us to elevate the quality of this production to a new level.  Please consider making your tax deductible

</div></div>","ABOUT THE SHOW Orford, the Suffolk coast, 1167. A fisherman hauls up a mysterious catch: a scaly, glistening creature from the depths of the sea. Man or monster? Is the wild man barbaric or simply free from the constraints of society? A tale from English folklore, fusing puppetry and video projections with live action and music. Rust & Stardust is a new Sussex collective combining theatre, puppetry, animation and music, through storytelling, folklore and mythology.
Following a three show run at the Brighton Fringe, including two SOLD OUT performances, The Wild Man of Orford will be venturing to Scotland for the annual Edinburgh Fringe in August. 
We have the costumes, we have the set, we have the beautiful puppets, cracking animation and a wonderful cast....all we need is your help.
WHAT WOULD YOUR DONATION COVER?
 

Travel Expenses: With the majority of the Company being based in Sussex, it's going to prove a lengthy (but hopefully enjoyable) journey by public transport, beginning at King's Cross.

Accommodation: We will not be going alone! Rust & Stardust will be working with Atomic Force Productions as part of ""The Sea of Stories"" during the run. The lodgings have been booked. However, being the Scottish capital and a fair few of us to accommodate, it's going to put us a bit out of pocket

Cast & Crew: We love what we do, it's great fun but it is our living as well. With your donation, no matter how big or small, you will be supporting our team with a basic wage and for that we would be truly thankful.
  Other Ways You Can Help
Come and see the show! The Wild Man of Orford is suitable and fun for all the family.

</p>
<p>I joined the team here at Children’s
Peace Theatre 11 years ago because I believe that each and everyone of us must be
engaged in creating peace in our own lives. When I saw how the Children’s Peace
Theatre was using theatre and art to transform conflict in the lives of youth
in my community, I wanted to help children and youth to use Courage, Compassion
and Creativity to build peaceful relationships with others.  </p>
<p>For 15 years Children’s Peace
Theatre has been Creating a Culture of Peace by engaging children and youth in
exploring the issues impacting their lives using the arts.  Our flagship program Peace Camp teaches Conflict
Transformation in action and bravely explores some of our societies most
entrenched issues.</p>
<p>I am so excited about this years production 'Raising
Revolution' which is about the raising of voices, the raising of consciousness,
a summoning of the moral energy of our youth, and a call to action for all
people who believe in the power
of people to fight for justice and dignity and to shape history in the process. 
It also refers to the raising of our children.  How do we raise young
people to see past their own their comforts, and past the version of the truth
spun by the media, to the question of how their government operates and how it
treats ALL of its people?  How do we raise young people who care enough
about TRUE democracy to question and challenge its impostor?</p><p></p><p>We are a tiny organization that packs a big punch. <b>In the past 15 years we have trained over 10,000 children and youth in Conflict Transformation and provided much needed arts programming and space for children and youth to create and dream.</b></p><p>In 2014 we were honoured as a finalist for the Toronto Arts Foundation youth award. </p><p><b>We’re committed to using Courage, Compassion and Creativity to make a difference in the lives of children and youth and to build more peaceful communities, but we can’t do it without your help.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>With fierce love,</p><p>Karen Emerson, </p><p>Artistic Director, Children’s Peace Theatre</p><p><br/></p>

<p><b>About The
Artists</b></p>
<p>Actor-director-playwright,
Tanisha Taitt is back for a third year as director of this year’s Peace Camp
2015 Summer Theatrical Production entitled “Raising Revolution”.  As an artist, Tanisha is well known for her
work with young people and adults addressing deep-rooted global issues with
powerful theatre.  </p>
<p>“In an election year, I am incredibly interested in
having children and youth become curious about and excited by the political
process.  I am even more excited, though, about having young people
invested at a deeper level -- asking the bigger and more profound questions
about their government and its ideologies.  I know that once again,
Children's Peace Theatre will take these young people on an incredible
investigative journey resulting in a poignant and resonant artistic
creation.  </p>
<p>I approach this project with a goal to have those
who participate in Raising Revolution come to understand the enormous power
that they hold, beyond the vote.  The power of their voices, and of their
choices.  I want them to know that political will, responsibility and
awareness are not limited to their parents and ""grown-ups"".  I
want them to see themselves as the promise of a better society.  I want
them to know that THEY are the revolution.” 
Tanisha Taitt</p>
<p>The Musical Director of “Raising
Revolution” is BROWNMAN ALI.  Hailed as “Canada’s preeminent jazz trumpet
player”, multiple Juno &amp; National Award winning trumpeter, BROWNMNAN is a
very familiar face at Children’s Peace Theatre.  BROWNMAN takes the month
of July off to work at CPT’s Peace Camp, writing the music for the theatrical
production and exposing the youth in the program to real-world expertise. 
His outstanding work with youth is yet reason another to support this year's production
of <i>Raising Revolution</i>.</p><p></p><p>                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433285200/uh8tefoo5bomaz7a4pol.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 451.890909090909px; height: 301px;""/></p><br/><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Ways You Can Support Us</b></p>

   The Impact Every pledge will go towards ensuring this play gets reviewed, published, and assuring its extended run within the Fringe and at a future venue.
    Risks & ChallengesWe're in a unique position -- we've confirmed our place in the festival and we're going either way. The risk we face without funding is that we can't pay our artists, we can't get the exposure this play needs to grow, and that we can't set the play up to have a future life beyond this festival.

<h1>ABOUT OUR SHOW</h1>
<p>""Cut-Throat: The Isolation of Ambition"" tells a story about two roommate actresses, entering the industry of the performing arts. Living in Toronto they face the struggles of low income and the resourcefulness required for their chosen career paths. Coincidently, each has a murderous past, that will come into play once they are up for the same role in an up and coming inter-arts production where the stakes are high. Our show highlights the differences between their experience, approach, and understanding of the industry, as well as how these differences work for and against their future success.</p>

<div></div>
</div>
<p>The Toronto Fringe, a proud member of Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals (CAFF), is a worldwide network of indie theatre festivals. What makes it unique is that it is lottery based, selecting up to 150 participants out of approximately 700 applications per year. With 100% box office going to the artists, the festival allows for artistic freedom of expression and it is an opportunity for those on the margins of the performing arts. It is a great platform for theatre students to mount their first production outside of school, and where emerging artists can get their big break, while established artists can test out new work.</p>

</div><p><b>THE CAMPAIGN TO TURN THE BALLROOM AT MECHANICS HALL INTO A MODERN PERFORMANCE VENUE<br/></b></p><p>Last fall, the Maine Charitable Mechanic Association (MCMA), the 
non-profit organization that owns and operates historic Mechanics’ Hall,
 located at 519 Congress Street in Portland, and Acorn Productions, a 
local community-based arts group, collaborated to raise over $14,000 to 
meet our Phase I fundraising goal.  This beautiful and elegant space was designed by 
John Calvin Stevens, but had been out of the public eye for over half a 
century. These funds enabled us to 
accomplish needed life and safety upgrades in order to receive a public 
assembly license that brought the historic third-floor ballroom at Mechanics
 Hall back into use. </p><p><b>We celebrated the re-opening of this space with a performance showcase on March 6th during First Friday, </b>and the ballroom has since hosted a variety of events, including an evening of staged readings of new plays, two Naked Shakespeare performances, swing dances, birthday parties, classes and workshops, and even a prom!<br/></p><p>While we are thrilled to have met our first fundraising 
goal, we now need to raise funds in order to complete upgrades and 
renovations. </p><p>The ballroom contains over 2,000 square feet of 
unimpeded floor space, with hardwood floors and high ceilings, making it
 the ideal venue for a variety of uses by theater and dance companies, 
educational institutions, individual instructors, and other community 
groups.  Phase II funding will allow us to repair and load-test the fire
 escape, acquire lighting equipment and seating, upgrade electrical 
service, and provide all the minor repairs and purchases that will make 
the space function as a professional performance venue. Once renovations
 are complete, the ballroom will become a cultural, social, and 
educational center for its members and the community, and its location 
in the heart of the Arts District will make it a hub of activity for a 
variety of performances and celebrations.
</p><p>This space has fired the imagination of Greater Portland’s arts 
community.  We are already receiving booking inquiries for a number of 
exciting events, including First Friday performances by Acorn’s Naked 
Shakespeare Ensemble as well as other classes, lectures, and, of course,
 ballroom dances.  With your help, we can make the Mechanics’ Hall 
ballroom a venue to last the ages.</p><p><b>WHAT YOUR DONATION BUYS</b></p><p>$35 – one padded armchair for the Ballroom</p><p>$50 – extension cord for the lighting system</p><p>$100 – one theater light for the Ballroom</p><p>$300 – a curtain panel for the windows in the Ballroom</p><p>$500- lighting “boom” for hanging lighting instruments</p><p>$1,000 – wireless dimmer pack for controlling lighting </p><p>$2,500 – theatrical drapes for back wall
</p><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b><br/>Restoring an historic space always brings hidden surprises, from realizing that we don't have enough bathrooms (which we are working on) to discovering that the wiring is too old to be easily upgraded to a level that will support a full complement of theater lights.  Not to mention how to install a lighting grid in a room with an historic ceiling.  Acorn is well positioned to meet these challenges, all of which we encountered and overcame when we partnered with the Friends of St. Lawrence in 2000/01 to renovate the Parish Hall of the old St. Lawrence Church into the St. Lawrence Arts Center.<br/><br/>We also are already discovering that some of the requirements that users of the space have are not as easily met with the current inventory of equipment in the space.  For instance, we have no podium for lectures.  In order to address these needs, we have formed an ad-hoc committee with representatives from many community groups to help MCMA create rental policies that work for all different types of users, as well as prioritizing the acquisition of new inventory based on the users' needs.<br/><p></p></div>","THE CAMPAIGN TO TURN THE BALLROOM AT MECHANICS HALL INTO A MODERN PERFORMANCE VENUELast fall, the Maine Charitable Mechanic Association (MCMA), the

RISKS AND CHALLENGESRestoring an historic space always brings hidden surprises, from realizing that we don't have enough bathrooms (which we are working on) to discovering that the wiring is too old to be easily upgraded to a level that will support a full complement of theater lights.  Not to mention how to install a lighting grid in a room with an historic ceiling.  Acorn is well positioned to meet these challenges, all of which we encountered and overcame when we partnered with the Friends of St. Lawrence in 2000/01 to renovate the Parish Hall of the old St. Lawrence Church into the St. Lawrence Arts Center.We also are already discovering that some of the requirements that users of the space have are not as easily met with the current inventory of equipment in the space.  For instance, we have no podium for lectures.  In order to address these needs, we have formed an ad-hoc committee with representatives from many community groups to help MCMA create rental policies that work for all different types of users, as well as prioritizing the acquisition of new inventory based on the users' needs.",0.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<p><b>Employment</b>: This
year, we hired a second full-time employee. When we purchase 10 N. Jay
Street, we will hire a third. Additionally, we will hire several part-time
employees, and increase our hiring of contract employees. Providing employment
is one way we are helping the local economy flourish.</p>
<p><b>Enhancing
walkability:</b> 10 N. Jay Street will serve as a critical enhancement
to the burgeoning lower Union Street/Little Italy area. It will also provide an
additional destination for patrons to eateries along Jay, State, and Union
Streets. An inviting and walkable arts and entertainment area in downtown
Schenectady, a long-held goal of city planners, is happening! </p>
<p><b>Blight
transformation</b>: 10 N. Jay Street is a historically important building. Mopco
plans to renovate it from its current state of blight into an attractive asset.
10 N. Jay is currently on the tax rolls as a storage facility, at a fraction of
its actual value. The building is at a critical point: it must be renovated soon.
Saving it will be untenable if it is left to further decline. Mopco is
dedicated to bringing the building back to its original status as a focal point
for N. Jay Street.

</p>
<p><b><span>Community
enrichment</span></b>: We will use 10 N. Jay Street. for a mixture of purposes:</p>

<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Classes, activities for adults and youth</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All of
which will enliven the immediate neighborhood during the day and night, and
bring a diverse mix of people to downtown.</p>
<p><b>Short-term
construction employment: </b>This project will supply
short-term employment to Schenectady construction contractors. The development
team includes AKW, Re4orm, Arket Electric, Pinnacle Roofing, D&amp;E
Technologies, with more to come…</p>
<p>With
your help, we can continue our investment in Schenectady. We plan to be a
valuable part of the burgeoning downtown scene, taking a blighted building in a
critical area and returning it to its highest and best use.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

</div>","Our Story
The Mop
& Bucket Improv Company has been bringing improvisational theatre to the Capital
Region for over 20 years. We’re known here as the “The Mother Ship” of
improv; we’ve taught and developed hundreds of performers, some of whom are now
running other great new improv troupes of their own.

Now our big
dream is happening: We’re buying an empty firehouse and turning it into our own theatre in Schenectady, NY. It’s
a huge project for us, and we’re putting a lot of our own dough on the line to
make it happen. We’ve got conventional funding, plus a grant from Schenectady’s Metroplex Development Authority,
and we are 99% fully funded.


The new theater is awesome because it
will provide:



New jobs
and growth for downtown Schenectady


Expansion
of Mopco programs for adults and youth


A new
performance venue for aspiring improvisers, young actors, and even filmmakers!


Continued
development of our own ensemble


2nd
floor offices for Koppett, our corporate training wing.

Streets. An inviting and walkable arts and entertainment area in downtown
Schenectady, a long-held goal of city planners, is happening! 
Blight
transformation: 10 N. Jay Street is a historically important building. Mopco
plans to renovate it from its current state of blight into an attractive asset.
10 N. Jay is currently on the tax rolls as a storage facility, at a fraction of
its actual value. The building is at a critical point: it must be renovated soon.
Saving it will be untenable if it is left to further decline. Mopco is
dedicated to bringing the building back to its original status as a focal point
for N. Jay Street.


Community
enrichment: We will use 10 N. Jay Street. for a mixture of purposes:



Office
Entertainment space
Classes, activities for adults and youth

All of
which will enliven the immediate neighborhood during the day and night, and
bring a diverse mix of people to downtown.
Short-term
construction employment: This project will supply
short-term employment to Schenectady construction contractors. The development
team includes AKW, Re4orm, Arket Electric, Pinnacle Roofing, D&E
Technologies, with more to come…
With
your help, we can continue our investment in Schenectady. We plan to be a
valuable part of the burgeoning downtown scene, taking a blighted building in a
critical area and returning it to its highest and best use.

<p>Tom, the Junior Republican Senator from Vermont, and his “steadfastly-faith’d” wife Lisa are celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary when they are surprised by their estranged, yet long-time friend Matt, who arrives ‘out of the blue’ with some news that is about to shake their world to its very core.</p>

Burnt Toast marks a celebration, a fifteen year anniversary. Unknowns can be scary, our potential can be scary, it is sometimes better to settle for what we have, close the doors and let the day roll on, but there are people who can change our lives. Burnt Toast is an exploration into the unknown, and what we’ll do for love. </p><p>Saxilby. Fifteen years later. Burnt toast. Boring sex. Viennetta. Knife roulette. We will do anything for the people that we love, even if it means eating burnt toast.</p><p><strong>Why do we think this play is important now?</strong></p><p>The UK, and the world is in a pretty strange situation right now, and people can feel trapped and dissatisfied in all walks of life, anywhere.

Burnt Toast marks a celebration, a fifteen year anniversary. Unknowns can be scary, our potential can be scary, it is sometimes better to settle for what we have, close the doors and let the day roll on, but there are people who can change our lives. Burnt Toast is an exploration into the unknown, and what we’ll do for love. Saxilby. Fifteen years later. Burnt toast. Boring sex. Viennetta. Knife roulette. We will do anything for the people that we love, even if it means eating burnt toast.Why do we think this play is important now?The UK, and the world is in a pretty strange situation right now, and people can feel trapped and dissatisfied in all walks of life, anywhere. This has led to a strange presence of many ‘known-unknowns’ and many ‘unknown-unknowns’ it can feel paralysing, but our resilience is a beautiful thing.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The cost of bringing a show to the Fringe is a huge challenge for most theatre companies but for those of us who come from working class and/or BAME backgrounds, that mountain can be even steeper to climb. However, we truly believe in the importance of this show, the relevance and poignancy of the script and the talent of our director and performers. Showcasing this kind of work is not only crucial to creating a more diverse and representative Fringe Festival but also to ensuring that the UK is adequately reflected across the theatre industry as a whole.</p>

<h3>Who started The Spark? And Why?</h3>
<p>Two determined ladies came together and asked... why can't we find space to perform our work?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">And thus The Spark was born. </p>
<p>Those two ladies are Dillon Kenyon and Marla Schulz. Both have a wealth of experience in theatre from establishing arts programs in public schools, choreographing and directing across the nation, and being part of the administrative teams at established schools and theatres. A community of families, teachers, and artists have gathered behind The Spark in their first year, bringing their wisdom, dedication, and passion to this highly needed space.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Boulder has been blessed by a financial boom, but unfortunately that has left artists behind as they struggle to find affordable space to create, rehearse, and perform. The Spark was created to help solve these issues in our community. We provide affordable space, education, and resources to all interested in the performing arts. Help us become a space the community can rely on!</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What we've done so far:</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">​We've come a long way since moving into an empty warehouse this past April. Not only have we successfully run several classes and workshops, but we transformed an empty space into a usable creative haven. We have opened our first two shows: <i>42nd Street</i> and <i>Fame The Musical</i> to sold out audiences and standing ovations. In addition to this, multiple artists are using our space for rehearsals and classes adding to the creative life of Boulder. </span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $20,000 to help us with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lighting equipment (we have the basics, but spend so much on rentals)</li>
<li>Completed bathrooms (we're so close!)</li>
<li>Dance studio flooring </li>
<li>Dressing Rooms</li>
<li>Sound Equipment</li>
<li>Production budget (costumes, scenery, music, all of it!)</li>

<p>What you get:</p>

<li>Studio naming rights</li>
<li>Signed Show Poster</li>
<li>Cameo in a future show</li>
<li>Social media shout out</li>
<li>and so much more...</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The main performance space in Boulder fills up every year and then still has a waiting list. There are artists that have so much to share, but there's just no space to do it. In addition, we provide comprehensive training that connects different generations of artists, making sure that art is supported and cherished at all ages. In case you need a few more reasons to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>The arts are an integral part of  successful community. By supporting theatre you are supporting the economy. It's tough to live in a place when there's no entertainment.</li>
<li>The performing arts help young adults find outlets to share frustrations, concerns, and stress in a safe and guided environment.</li>
<li>Live performance is not only a cultural tool, but an educational one.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting a theatre is hard. No doubt about it. We rely on volunteers, donors, and continuous support from the community in order to thrive. Fortunately we've had an outpouring of love and help in these beginning stages. Our biggest challenge currently is construction. We've faced delays, and unexpected costs the whole way. There's a light at the end of the tunnel but the journey's not over yet.</p>
<p>A few things to ease your concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our board is filled with dedicated and experienced individuals in the theatre and business communities.</li>
<li>We have the support of the Boulder Arts Alliance, and performance community, eager to see us succeed. </li>
<li>Creative minds find creative solutions. And we live by that every single day. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't got the dough? There are so many other ways to be part of the team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this with anyone and everyone. Facebook, Instagram, twitter, email, Nextdoor. The more people know the more support we can get. </li>
<li>Volunteer! We have so many opportunities for involvement. Want to usher, help build a set, organize some costumes, or hang up flyers? We've got a job for everyone. </li>
<li>Know kids or young adults looking for theatrical training? Send them our way. We help keep things affordable with our educational programming. Not only that, but it keeps the performing arts thriving in our community. </li>

The Impact
The main performance space in Boulder fills up every year and then still has a waiting list. There are artists that have so much to share, but there's just no space to do it. In addition, we provide comprehensive training that connects different generations of artists, making sure that art is supported and cherished at all ages. In case you need a few more reasons to support:

The arts are an integral part of  successful community. By supporting theatre you are supporting the economy. It's tough to live in a place when there's no entertainment.
The performing arts help young adults find outlets to share frustrations, concerns, and stress in a safe and guided environment.
Live performance is not only a cultural tool, but an educational one.


Risks & Challenges
Starting a theatre is hard. No doubt about it. We rely on volunteers, donors, and continuous support from the community in order to thrive. Fortunately we've had an outpouring of love and help in these beginning stages. Our biggest challenge currently is construction. We've faced delays, and unexpected costs the whole way. There's a light at the end of the tunnel but the journey's not over yet.
A few things to ease your concerns:

Our board is filled with dedicated and experienced individuals in the theatre and business communities.
We have the support of the Boulder Arts Alliance, and performance community, eager to see us succeed. 
Creative minds find creative solutions. And we live by that every single day. 


Other Ways You Can Help
Don't got the dough? There are so many other ways to be part of the team:

Share this with anyone and everyone. Facebook, Instagram, twitter, email, Nextdoor. The more people know the more support we can get. 
Volunteer! We have so many opportunities for involvement. Want to usher, help build a set, organize some costumes, or hang up flyers? We've got a job for everyone. 
Know kids or young adults looking for theatrical training? Send them our way. We help keep things affordable with our educational programming. Not only that, but it keeps the performing arts thriving in our community.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3> What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><b>Very fortunately (thank you Fringe!) we have been provided with a lovely performance space in The National Museum of Women in the Arts, as well as a practical ticketing system. We are also making every effort to reduce expenditures by making use of public spaces for rehearsals, and by committing to the low-tech/no-tech nature of the Fringe Festival. </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">That said, projects such as these still present us with a number of other costs, and help from lovely people such as yourself is vital! </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Let's break it down:</span><br/></p> <ul> <li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fringe participation fees</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Insurance fees</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">7 actors - because we believe in making it ever-so-slightly more possible for our artists to afford making art!</span></li>

<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A minimal, and easily transportable/storable set that will allow our stage to exist as 6 different settings</span></li>

</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Props (you can't hunt down a unicorn without the proper tools...)</span></li> </ul>
<div>All of these costs add up quickly, but we strongly believe that between our own investment of funds, ticket-sales (of which we keep approx. 50%,) and your help, we can certainly make this happen - As tokens of appreciation, we've conjured up some sweet (and completely original!) goodies for those so righteous as to help us on our quest! Check out the ""Perks"" tab!</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3> The Impact</h3> <p><b>Let's get a little more in-depth.</b></p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">SpookyMsgPlsFWD! grapples with intricate matters as broad as human rights, (gun) violence, and internet privacy, to ones as specific as the 2016 US election season. But at its core, SpookyMsg really aims to combat the dangerous culture of complacency/political apathy increasingly evident in American youth.  </span>
</li>
</ul>
<b>But it's about more than the show itself. Cats Onstage believe in change at the local level. We are supporting our local arts community.</b>
</div><div><ul>
<li>This is a 100% brand-new play - it's obvious to say we support the creation and development of new/original plays and other works of art. </li>
<li>In compensating all our artists, we are directly and tangibly supporting our arts community. </li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">On a larger scale, since 2006 the Capital Fringe Festival has: provided </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">866 paid positions (469 to DC residents,) and </span><a href=""https://www.capitalfringe.org/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""premiered over 600 new works of contemporary performance""</a><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
</li>
</ul></div><div>
<b>The Cats also want to take this opportunity as a chance to actively fight back against the greater issue of lack of representation and diversity prevalent in the arts. </b>While we are most definitely proud to be featured as one of two ""women-centric"" productions being performed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts during the Festival, we can't help but consider the inherent problems found in that statement. This is only compounded by the fact that though our play features a ""strong female lead,"" our play was not written by a woman, and may not necessarily, or appropriately, represent the female experience.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">As such, our production committed to an openly gender/race-blind casting process (something which is still unfortunately </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">not</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> a given) and </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">a production team comprised nearly entirely of women (all but one, in fact!)</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><div>These things need to be seen as normal.</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we're able to use the (literal and figurative) platform we've been given by Capital Fringe to change a mind, spark a dialogue, and/or even just transmute a modicum of hate in the world, into love, we will have succeeded. </span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div> <div> <h3> Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>From the stages of conception and writing, to the first day of rehearsal, to opening night, the production of a play is no easy task. Fortunately, Capital Fringe has provided us with an amazing performance-space, equipped with sound, lighting, and projection equipment - all things which could ultimately cost several thousand dollars. But as noted, there are many other parts of this production that we will have to cover. We will have ticket-sales and a carefully planned marketing strategy to assist us, but we cannot rely solely on ticket-sales. Acquiring the funds necessary to create our props/set/costumes, and compensate our artists, as well as offset the initial Fringe participation fees, will be one of our greater challenges. </p>
<p>Aside from this are the inherent risks bound to the creation of any artwork. Our experienced artists are not only accustomed to these risks, but also share an absolute love for the craft. We have been, and will continue to be, hard at work to ensure this project comes to fruition.</p>

We are also making every effort to reduce expenditures by making use of public spaces for rehearsals, and by committing to the low-tech/no-tech nature of the Fringe Festival. That said, projects such as these still present us with a number of other costs, and help from lovely people such as yourself is vital! 
Let's break it down:  Fringe participation fees
Insurance fees
7 actors - because we believe in making it ever-so-slightly more possible for our artists to afford making art!
Team of creators ranging from costume, sound, and web designers, to our fight choreographer
A minimal, and easily transportable/storable set that will allow our stage to exist as 6 different settings

Costuming, with which to help our 7 actors shapeshift between the 25 distinct characters they will play throughout the show

Props (you can't hunt down a unicorn without the proper tools...) 
All of these costs add up quickly, but we strongly believe that between our own investment of funds, ticket-sales (of which we keep approx. 50%,) and your help, we can certainly make this happen - As tokens of appreciation, we've conjured up some sweet (and completely original!) goodies for those so righteous as to help us on our quest! Check out the ""Perks"" tab!
    The Impact Let's get a little more in-depth.
Specifically:


SpookyMsgPlsFWD! grapples with intricate matters as broad as human rights, (gun) violence, and internet privacy, to ones as specific as the 2016 US election season. But at its core, SpookyMsg really aims to combat the dangerous culture of complacency/political apathy increasingly evident in American youth.  


But it's about more than the show itself. Cats Onstage believe in change at the local level. We are supporting our local arts community.

This is a 100% brand-new play - it's obvious to say we support the creation and development of new/original plays and other works of art. 
In compensating all our artists, we are directly and tangibly supporting our arts community. 

On a larger scale, since 2006 the Capital Fringe Festival has: provided 866 paid positions (469 to DC residents,) and ""premiered over 600 new works of contemporary performance""


The Cats also want to take this opportunity as a chance to actively fight back against the greater issue of lack of representation and diversity prevalent in the arts. While we are most definitely proud to be featured as one of two ""women-centric"" productions being performed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts during the Festival, we can't help but consider the inherent problems found in that statement. This is only compounded by the fact that though our play features a ""strong female lead,"" our play was not written by a woman, and may not necessarily, or appropriately, represent the female experience.
As such, our production committed to an openly gender/race-blind casting process (something which is still unfortunately not a given) and a production team comprised nearly entirely of women (all but one, in fact!)
These things need to be seen as normal.If we're able to use the (literal and figurative) platform we've been given by Capital Fringe to change a mind, spark a dialogue, and/or even just transmute a modicum of hate in the world, into love, we will have succeeded.    Risks & Challenges From the stages of conception and writing, to the first day of rehearsal, to opening night, the production of a play is no easy task. Fortunately, Capital Fringe has provided us with an amazing performance-space, equipped with sound, lighting, and projection equipment - all things which could ultimately cost several thousand dollars. But as noted, there are many other parts of this production that we will have to cover. We will have ticket-sales and a carefully planned marketing strategy to assist us, but we cannot rely solely on ticket-sales. Acquiring the funds necessary to create our props/set/costumes, and compensate our artists, as well as offset the initial Fringe participation fees, will be one of our greater challenges. 
Aside from this are the inherent risks bound to the creation of any artwork. Our experienced artists are not only accustomed to these risks, but also share an absolute love for the craft. We have been, and will continue to be, hard at work to ensure this project comes to fruition.

DE PARTE DE LA FUNDACION RAJATABLA , NECESITAMOS  DINERO PARA REMUNERAR EL
TRABAJO DE TODO EL PERSONAL INVOLUCRADO EN EL PROYECTO Y PARA CUMPLIR CON LOS
PAGOS  RELACIONADOS CON INTERVENCIÓN DE ESCENOGRAFÍA, VESTUARIO Y
 PROMOCIÓN.

Our most sincere reason...
In these
times, when we see ourselves tempted to do plays to evade, only to distract,  we put our bet to do committed,
confronting  theater that collaborates on
elevating our and the audience's consciousness level.
Oddly,  despite our economy,  theater plays have had a big rise of
popularity amongst the entertainment options in Caracas. And we're sure that
there is a big audience for this genre, and the people who go to RAJATABLA
theater are part of this exquisite audience.
This
initiative through this crowdfunding campaign is not only to fund, but an
invitation that we are making all of you to accompany us in this adventure, in
this dream that we want to make come true. 
Any
collaboration that we can get from you will be very valuable to us.
The power of
giving: This is a law of life. What goes around comes around,  in many magical ways,  multiplied in effects. NUESTRA MAS SINCERA RAZON.
EL PODER DE DAR: ESTO
ES LEY DE VIDA… AQUELLO QUE DAS REGRESA A TI, DE MUCHAS Y MÁGICAS MANERAS,
MULTIPLICADO EN SUS EFECTOS.

<p>DREAM TICKET was penned by playwright Ryan Bernsten years after watching the debates between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and asking ""what if they had a history...?"" Today, it's a full length new play appearing as part of the New York Fringe Festival in August. This international festival will be attended by friends, family, producers, scouts, and theatre-goers from around the world. </p>
<p>Why is this important? Well, many professional Broadways shows got their start here at the New York Fringe Festival! Shows such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinetown"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Urinetown</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Sees_God:_Confessions_of_a_Teenage_Blockhead"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dog Sees God</a> got their launch with the Fringe. And, most importantly, it's a timely, fun piece of new theatre that takes a good hard look at our political system while offering big laughs.</p>
<p>The team is strong and passionate; DREAM TICKET is directed by Kristin Skye Hoffman (Outstanding Director, Fringe NYC 2012) and associate directed by Marylynne Anderson-Cooper (director of the Dream Ticket World Premiere at Northwestern University). </p>
<p>The cast features Chris Payseur as Senator Leslie Sugarman, Amy Lee Pearsall* as Senator Becky Roberts, Toni Martin* as Patty Baxter, Olivia Jampol as Darla Finger, Erik Gullberg* as Rex Herman, Adam Hyland as Thomas Stevenson, Desiree Staples as Wanda Puffin, and Ryan Bernsten as Ty Chadwick.</p>
<p>Designers are Laurel Livezey and Christina Tang; Stage Management is headed by Benjamin Vigil; our producing team is led by Alex Donnelly, Margaret Gandolpho, Alex  Knezevic, Kylie Mullins, and Max Rein.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>12,000 seems like a lot for a play, we know. But when you factor in paying professional Equity actors, professional designers, professional directors, making sure we have a set, lights, advertising–well, it adds up. </li>
<li>But, we have fun ways for you to get involved. Even the smallest donations make you a part of the show, but if you want to literally be ""part of the show"" check out our perks and see how your donation can make you a unique part of this world premiere new play. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, every penny will be returned to you. Easy as that.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>Every artist gets their start with an opportunity like this; from a playwright fresh to New York City to a team of actors new to the Fringe Festival, every penny to donate translates to the creation of something that didn't exist before, all because of your faith and generosity. </li></ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<br/><br/>Let me tell you they sure have been scandalous this year while you've been gone.  They wanted their own Burlesque Cabaret so they’ve danced on bars in Orlando; they took off their clothes from Pompano Beach to St. Augustine; they’ve performed on large event stages, for small private parties and even at charitable concerts all over Central Florida. Oh my, what would their mothers say?!
<br/><br/>If that isn’t enough, those<strong> Blacklist Babes</strong> won themselves an award as a burlesque cabaret troupe in <strong>The Venue</strong>’s Amateur Burlesque contest.  Did you hear what they did next??  Those boys and girls went out and performed at the main stage at Lake Eola during the <strong>Orlando Pride</strong> event.  Bless their hearts.
<br/><br/>When you are around, these hard working artists spend their days in retail, education, theme parks and college…and that ain’t cheap.  Now they tell me they have dreams of this <strong>International Orlando Fringe Festival</strong> and had their show accepted for <strong>The Black Venue</strong>.  Let me explain a few things involved in making the magic happen:
<br/>•	Festival Fees
<br/>•	Technical Production Fees
<br/>•	Posters and Marketing Material
<br/>•	Published Music Fees
<br/><br/>
Shake my head, those darn kids desperately need help.  They rehearse twice a week and are busy performing one to five times a month.  They keep telling me long nights, show day jitters, sore feet and corset mishaps are worth it to be able to produce their own show. Maybe they can get your help getting there?<br/><br/>I am asking for them since they've decided to name their first show extravaganza after me, ain't that sweet!  I don't want to brag, but they tell me they know it will be a good time when I show up - Mercy, these <strong>Babes</strong> and <strong>Dolls</strong> sure know how to make me blush!<br/><br/>Sincerely,

</div></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>What you can expect...An adventurous evening of 
awareness! </b></p><p><b></b></p><p>Cockpit is a fast-paced, unpredictable comic-tragedy. You can expect an evening of laughter, surprise and excitement that at the same time takes a focused, terrifying look at contemporary American life. Romance and violence forge new identities, betrayal comes from those closest to us and the ravages of the war on terror are made visible on the suburban home front.  A play of national themes, COCKPIT examines the impossibility of finding safety through security in America.  It makes visible the phenomena of war trauma and privatized war.  It contrasts the pain of the sex industry with the grueling monotony of conventional domesticity.  It holds up to the light our national obsession with guns and speed, and asks whether our political and academic discourses are adequate to address our country’s most deeply rooted problems.  You will experience a play that inspires honest discussion and debate, that helps to clarify what is most lacking in American life, and ventures to ask how what divides Americans most from each other can be overcome by a greater degree of understanding and compassion.</p><br/><p><b><b>Producing <i>COCKPIT </i>- how it all came together...</b></b></p><div>
<p>COCKPIT developed out of playwright Steve Bellwood’s experience driving cross-country with a former girlfriend and finding himself often welcomed in to strangers homes for the night.  One particular evening he met two individuals thatprovided the genesis of Ivan and Ruth.  In September 2013 his play was produced as The Specials at the Whitney Arts Center in New Haven, Connecticut to packed, energized and engaged houses.  Each evening included a long talkback with food, wine and beer, where audiences discussed and debated the political issues treated by the play, and the strengths of the script and staging.  The play was lauded in the local press. Director, James Leaf believing greatly in the strength of the script and hoping that it would be seen in New York, asked his friend and artistic partner Luisa Muhr to collaborate in giving the play a new incarnation.  Out of the desire to give the work a new treatment for a new audience FENGARI Ensemble was founded.  We are happy to be staging this production at The Balcony Theatre at The West Park Presbyterian Church, a beautiful, unconventional and dynamic venue on the Upper West Side.

</div><br/><div>
<b>Why this story - why support us?<br/><br/></b>COCKPIT emerges as a deeply urgent and timely drama that lays 
bare the cost of the war on terror in relation to the American domestic 
front.  The play explores the gap and the bridging of the gap between 
soldiers and civilians, men and women, those who work with their bodies 
and those who work with their intellects. It examines the nature of 
addiction and desire, the fragility of identity, the complicity in 
violence Americans share, and the ability of lives to change rapidly 
over the course of one night. </div><div>Cockpit is if anything an urgent story.   The play is about the divisions that 
<p>exist today between Americans and the possibility of overcoming these divisions. The work emerges as a deeply timely drama that lays bare the cost of the war on terror in relation to the American domestic front.  The play explores the gap and the bridging of the gap between soldiers and civilians, men and women, those who work with their bodies and those who work with their intellects.  It examines the nature of addiction and desire, the fragility of identity, the complicity in violence Americans share, and the ability of lives to change rapidly over the course of one night. A darklycomic, exhilarating and intoxicating comic tragedy is swiftly entertaining while provoking some of the most important questions that New Yorkers and Americans can ask themselves in 2016.

 of the money goes into the theater rental –  which is incredibly expensive in NYC.<br/>Other
 big costs are definitely set and props, actually compensating our 
production and creative team, renting the lights, insurance, and marketing (mostly printing costs and advertising).<b><b><br/><br/>Flex Goals</b></b><p>It is really important that even when we have reached our
goal of $5800 we please need you to keep supporting us! <b>This first goal does
NOT cover all our costs.</b> We picked a lower goal, so that we can be assured to
at least cover some of the costs. Looking ahead and calculating in what we have
already had to spend, our expenses come to around  (breakdown in
percentages see budget diagram). This is mostly due to the expensive rehearsal
space rental in NYC (although we always rehearse at the cheapest rental studio
in town), but also to cover the rent of the theater and all other expenses. We
are hoping to fill the theater on all 4 performances, so are expecting to cover
more costs with the ticket sales, however that is not guaranteed. </p>
<p>
So we really need your help to raise our next goals in order to make this
production work!</p>

<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the exciting, challenging risks in our work on this production is choosing to commit to a new play without a significant production history based on our deep belief in the strength of the story, the writing and the utter necessity of making sure this story is told.  We are also committing to work in a very new performance venue with it’s own special challenges because we believe it is a unique and compelling space where theatre should continue to be made.  We are pursuing this fundraising-campaign largely to defray the costs of renting this wonderful theatre.  Further costs include the acquisition of a number of large and small props essential to the plot of the play, and the expenses for our lighting plan that will not be covered by the theatre.  We are also spending money in marketing this show, ensuring that we are able to fill our houses, and that this original work may be seen by as many people as possible.  Further, although many talented artists are working on this project as volunteers we are paying those who have put in serious work as actors, designers, producers and stage-managers. </p>

Romance and violence forge new identities, betrayal comes from those closest to us and the ravages of the war on terror are made visible on the suburban home front.  A play of national themes, COCKPIT examines the impossibility of finding safety through security in America.  It makes visible the phenomena of war trauma and privatized war.  It contrasts the pain of the sex industry with the grueling monotony of conventional domesticity.  It holds up to the light our national obsession with guns and speed, and asks whether our political and academic discourses are adequate to address our country’s most deeply rooted problems.  You will experience a play that inspires honest discussion and debate, that helps to clarify what is most lacking in American life, and ventures to ask how what divides Americans most from each other can be overcome by a greater degree of understanding and compassion.Producing COCKPIT - how it all came together...
COCKPIT developed out of playwright Steve Bellwood’s experience driving cross-country with a former girlfriend and finding himself often welcomed in to strangers homes for the night.  One particular evening he met two individuals thatprovided the genesis of Ivan and Ruth.  In September 2013 his play was produced as The Specials at the Whitney Arts Center in New Haven, Connecticut to packed, energized and engaged houses.  Each evening included a long talkback with food, wine and beer, where audiences discussed and debated the political issues treated by the play, and the strengths of the script and staging.  The play was lauded in the local press. Director, James Leaf believing greatly in the strength of the script and hoping that it would be seen in New York, asked his friend and artistic partner Luisa Muhr to collaborate in giving the play a new incarnation.  Out of the desire to give the work a new treatment for a new audience FENGARI Ensemble was founded.  We are happy to be staging this production at The Balcony Theatre at The West Park Presbyterian Church, a beautiful, unconventional and dynamic venue on the Upper West Side.


Why this story - why support us?COCKPIT emerges as a deeply urgent and timely drama that lays 
bare the cost of the war on terror in relation to the American domestic 
front.  The play explores the gap and the bridging of the gap between 
soldiers and civilians, men and women, those who work with their bodies 
and those who work with their intellects. It examines the nature of 
addiction and desire, the fragility of identity, the complicity in 
violence Americans share, and the ability of lives to change rapidly 
over the course of one night. Cockpit is if anything an urgent story.   The play is about the divisions that 
exist today between Americans and the possibility of overcoming these divisions. The work emerges as a deeply timely drama that lays bare the cost of the war on terror in relation to the American domestic front.  The play explores the gap and the bridging of the gap between soldiers and civilians, men and women, those who work with their bodies and those who work with their intellects.  It examines the nature of addiction and desire, the fragility of identity, the complicity in violence Americans share, and the ability of lives to change rapidly over the course of one night. A darklycomic, exhilarating and intoxicating comic tragedy is swiftly entertaining while provoking some of the most important questions that New Yorkers and Americans can ask themselves in 2016.

Our adventures, efforts, and highs so
far
Budget – How is the
money distributed and where does it go?



Most
 of the money goes into the theater rental –  which is incredibly expensive in NYC.Other
 big costs are definitely set and props, actually compensating our 
production and creative team, renting the lights, insurance, and marketing (mostly printing costs and advertising).Flex GoalsIt is really important that even when we have reached our
goal of $5800 we please need you to keep supporting us! This first goal does
NOT cover all our costs. We picked a lower goal, so that we can be assured to
at least cover some of the costs. Looking ahead and calculating in what we have
already had to spend, our expenses come to around  (breakdown in
percentages see budget diagram). This is mostly due to the expensive rehearsal
space rental in NYC (although we always rehearse at the cheapest rental studio
in town), but also to cover the rent of the theater and all other expenses. We
are hoping to fill the theater on all 4 performances, so are expecting to cover
more costs with the ticket sales, however that is not guaranteed. 

So we really need your help to raise our next goals in order to make this
production work!
$6500
This will help us to cover a big amount of our costs! Thank you!
$7000 
Great! We are not too far away from covering all our main costs without having to
depend on ticket sales – thank you so much!
$8000
Yay! We can pretty much cover our main costs! Thank you! You are also making it possible for the amazing production
and creative team to receive a fair compensation for their incredibly hard
work! This is very important to us since so much work has gone into developing Dolores. 
$8500 and beyond
Hooray! Apart from guaranteeing the amazing production and
creative team a fair stipend you are making it possible to actually compensate
the cast and director for all their hard work and immense efforts! In addition
to that we will donate any amount past our $6500 flex goal to .With this we want to support an organization that focuses on
supporting survivors of abuse. You have helped to really make a 
difference and we are so very grateful! Thank you so, so much! 

Risks and Challenges

One of the exciting, challenging risks in our work on this production is choosing to commit to a new play without a significant production history based on our deep belief in the strength of the story, the writing and the utter necessity of making sure this story is told.  We are also committing to work in a very new performance venue with it’s own special challenges because we believe it is a unique and compelling space where theatre should continue to be made.  We are pursuing this fundraising-campaign largely to defray the costs of renting this wonderful theatre.  Further costs include the acquisition of a number of large and small props essential to the plot of the play, and the expenses for our lighting plan that will not be covered by the theatre.  We are also spending money in marketing this show, ensuring that we are able to fill our houses, and that this original work may be seen by as many people as possible.  Further, although many talented artists are working on this project as volunteers we are paying those who have put in serious work as actors, designers, producers and stage-managers.

<p>Theatre Rapscallions was created in 2015 with the goal of bringing new and rarely seen work to the D/FW area. With a mission to have over half of their programming be originally and locally scripted, Theatre Rapscallions is filling<br/>its ambitious first season with Stay Carl Stay by Peter Tolan, David Mamet's Oleanna,  a 48 hour play fest this summer, a one act fest, featuring local and new playwrights, and a staged reading of various works by Dallas writer Steven Young  on March 19th. Theatre Rapscallions will also be staging performances at area bars, breweries and coffee shops through its Offstage Rapscallions Players.</p>
<p>While developing their inaugural season, Theatre Rapscallions quickly realized there was a need in D/FW for both new and original work as well as an opportunity for site-specific performances, bringing the stage to the community and not only relying on audiences coming to them. Immediately, a one act fest featuring only local work, a 48 hour play fest with scripts written, rehearsed and produced in that timeframe and The Offstage Rapscallions division of Theatre Rapscallions was added to that ambitious list of 2016 goals. Plans for a charitable division to work with young talent from under funded schools to write, produce and perform on the Rapscallions stage is in the works as well.</p>
<p>Theatre Rapscallions has a mission to entertain, challenge, inspire and nurture the cultural life of D/FW not only for the current community but future generations.</p>
<p>“For most of us, art, performing, is a luxury. We are so lucky to have the opportunity to do what we do and share the stories we are able to tell.” says managing director Stephanie Stone-Robb. “We want to now take this opportunity to tell stories, both original and previously produced, that might never get told otherwise. We want to make people laugh, make people think, and everything in between.”</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our $5000 goal is a just under half of our modest budget to produce our  shows this year and offer educational subsidies.  This will help to cover costs of costuming, set, performance rights and so much more.  </p>

Visit Our Website

Theatre Rapscallions was created in 2015 with the goal of bringing new and rarely seen work to the D/FW area. With a mission to have over half of their programming be originally and locally scripted, Theatre Rapscallions is fillingits ambitious first season with Stay Carl Stay by Peter Tolan, David Mamet's Oleanna,  a 48 hour play fest this summer, a one act fest, featuring local and new playwrights, and a staged reading of various works by Dallas writer Steven Young  on March 19th. Theatre Rapscallions will also be staging performances at area bars, breweries and coffee shops through its Offstage Rapscallions Players.
While developing their inaugural season, Theatre Rapscallions quickly realized there was a need in D/FW for both new and original work as well as an opportunity for site-specific performances, bringing the stage to the community and not only relying on audiences coming to them. Immediately, a one act fest featuring only local work, a 48 hour play fest with scripts written, rehearsed and produced in that timeframe and The Offstage Rapscallions division of Theatre Rapscallions was added to that ambitious list of 2016 goals. Plans for a charitable division to work with young talent from under funded schools to write, produce and perform on the Rapscallions stage is in the works as well.
Theatre Rapscallions has a mission to entertain, challenge, inspire and nurture the cultural life of D/FW not only for the current community but future generations.
“For most of us, art, performing, is a luxury. We are so lucky to have the opportunity to do what we do and share the stories we are able to tell.” says managing director Stephanie Stone-Robb. “We want to now take this opportunity to tell stories, both original and previously produced, that might never get told otherwise. We want to make people laugh, make people think, and everything in between.”   What We Need & What You Get Our $5000 goal is a just under half of our modest budget to produce our  shows this year and offer educational subsidies.  This will help to cover costs of costuming, set, performance rights and so much more.  
All of our perks are over on the right.  $10 donation will get you a signed and personalized post card from our crew at Theatre Rapscallions.  Feeling more generous?  We got you covered with show posters, season tickets, VIP events and more!

<h2>About The Show</h2>
<p>'If you hear this from anybody else, they’ll tell it wrong.’​</p>
<p>Texas, 1969. The country is bursting with vibes of peace, love and rock ‘n’ roll. Fronting a rock band, raising some hell, Jeannie’s a disgrace to her mother and having the time of her life.​</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Texas is the world of oil and big business. Rock music is owned by the Stones, Hendrix, Dylan and the Beatles. So where does a sweet Southern girl turn if she doesn't want to be a sweet Southern girl?</p>
<p>The stories of epic and tragic rises and falls from grace in the world of rock-and-roll are well documented, but rarely do we hear these stories told by a female protagonist. Locked in a room with only a tape recorder for company, Jeannie is determined to explain the creative quest that led her across the state, abandoning home and defying the expectations of a young woman in conservative America.</p>
<p>This 'breathtaking' story of a vibrant, gutsy, unconventional woman played to rave reviews at both Theatre503 and the Pleasance, Edinburgh in 2014 and 2015 respectively. We are thrilled to have the chance to develop the piece with a full band and present this epic piece to the St James audience. </p>
<p><br/><i>""That's the thing about women in the music business, man. Because women sing their fuckin' insides, man. Women, to be in the music business, give up more than you'd ever know.""</i> - Janis Joplin</p>

We plan to take it to a top-notch London theatre for a full run, and it's crucial that we get the St James performances just right so we can show theatre programmers in London and beyond just why this show is so special.  </p>

<div>Hi guys! It's your friendly Facebook Cuzzin, Lonnie Colon.  I'm here to ask you to join me in supporting The Irving Bears/L.A.C.E.R. Drill Team.  The Drill Team is made up of four (4) amazing and dedicated young ladies.  The squad is part of the L.A.C.E.R. after school program and represents their school, Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School.  The L.A.C.E.R. program provides free arts and literacy based after school programs.   </div>
<div>This current team is the first drill team the middle school has had in over three years.  We started out with a 'strong seven', but due to scheduling conflicts and the newness of the squad, we now find ourselves with what I like to call, <b>The Fortified Four!</b>  These young ladies, along with their advisor Coach Karla, have dedicated their time and effort five days a week to becoming outstanding individual performers.  But more importantly they've become a strong unit that fights to get better each day. They are determined to represent their school and bring back the excitement of drill to Irving STEAM Magnet Middle School. That's why I call 'em <b>The Fortified Four!</b>
