<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story<br/>
</h3>
<div>Set in the brush of South Texas, <i>Chupaboer</i> is the tale of Herbie Boer, who's just your average, run-of-the-mill goat. In order to come to terms with the loss of his mother, he practices yoga daily with his best friend, Precious Pygmy. At least, he tries to practice, but Bub, the herd leader, takes pleasure in disturbing Herbie just to remind our hero that he's a bottle baby and will never be capable of taking care of the does, particularly Nancy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>One night, Bub is snatched up by a creature many goats have heard of but none have seen: The Breath. Herbie is all set to say, ""Good riddance,"" to Bub's teasing, but when Nancy asks him to go Breath-hunting for the good of the herd, and maybe even rescue Bub in the process, Herbie just can't say no. This request puts him on a journey that'll test his inner strength, and maybe, just maybe, help him get the girl.</div>

<p align=""justify"">My name is Owen Ratliff, President of Ratti Entertainment LLC and creator of a martial arts transmedia franchise, entitled<strong> “<a href=""http://blacksaltfilm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Salt</a>”.</strong> <strong>We have been working to help as many kids as we can through our sales of Black Salt products and are working hard to complete another product line with our graphic novel. Through our sales we are able to help kids who have lost their programs due to school budget cuts and replace them.</strong> We attempted to finish the comic book/graphic novel project a year ago, but my brother took ill with diabetes, so I put the project on hold to take care of him. Since his recent passing, I have been dealing with this terrible loss in my life and have only now just found the strength to finish the project, which will be dedicated to my big brother, Hubert Ross. It is interesting how, after a tragic event such as this, we find the need to prioritize that which was once important to us. So, I am turning to our fans and the public for the strength and support to see this project through to completion and help us help ""Save Our Kids""!</p>
<h2><strong>Project Summary </strong></h2>
<p align=""justify"">The comic book story is adapted from the original screenplay. This 6 issue comic book series is entitled <strong><em>“<a href=""http://www.blacksaltfilm.com/site/index.php?/Black-Salt-The-Last-Heroes-Left-Comic-Book-Series.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Salt; The Last Heroes Left</a>”.</em></strong> The story is an epic thriller, merging the world of modern-day espionage and political intrigue, with the world of ancient martial arts. Samuel Tharpe is the top counter terrorism agent in the world. For years, he has hunted down and foiled the twisted plans of the world’s most dangerous criminal organizations, crime lords, warmongers and anarchists. But Sam is no ordinary agent. He was trained secretly, outside the temple walls, one of the lost arts of Shaolin by the legendary Master Yu Bai Shek. He is a master of many weapons and is able to do incredible athletic feats that border on superhuman. He is even able to generate extremely high levels of chi energy that he uses in offensive attacks.</p>

<p align=""justify""> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need (and why) </strong></h2>
<p align=""justify"">The first 4 issues are completed and the 5<sup>th</sup> issue is ready for coloring. The script and cover art are completed for the last issue. We need to raise <strong>$5,500</strong> to color issue five, do pencils/inks/color for issue 6 and create the graphic novel cover.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">This amount of money will cover:</h3>
<p align=""justify"" style=""margin-left: 60px;"">1) Coloring Issue #5<br/>2) Lettering Issue #5<br/>3) Pre-Press Issue #5<br/>4) Pencil/Inks Issue #6<br/>5) Coloring Issue #6<br/>6) Lettering Issue #6<br/>7) Pre-Press Issue #6<br/>8) Pencil/Inks/Color Graphic Novel Cover<br/>9) Pre-Press Graphic Novel (all six issues combined)<br/>10) Printing comic book copies</p>
<p align=""justify"">Funding above our goal in this campaign will go toward marketing, promotions and printing cost. </p>
<p align=""justify"">We have some very interested publishers, but we have to turn in a fully completed series. Our strategy is to start by distributing the single issues through all the digital platforms, and then release single issues through print (after the third issue is released). We will be releasing the graphic novel after the 6th issue is completed, (all 6 issues combined), to cover the book market as well as the comic book market. Ratti’s main goal is to release the comic book series and the apparel line to build the brand and establish the Intellectual property as a bankable IP.</p>
<p align=""justify"">There are several small factors that set <em><strong>Black Salt</strong> </em>apart from other comics. First, there is still a big demand for the action martial arts genre. This genre is a niche target market of over 100 million martial artists and enthusiasts worldwide. Secondly, our grass roots marketing campaign has already generated a buzz of more than 1.5 million hits on the website <a href=""http://www.blacksaltfilm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.blacksaltfilm.com</a>. Thirdly, <em><strong>Black Salt</strong> </em>has a fully developed feature film project that could go into pre-production immediately.</p>
<h2><strong>What You Get (Perks!)</strong></h2>
<p align=""justify"">We have a number of pledges and rewards listed to the right. Please review the options and consider extending your support. Anything you give is appreciated - as every dollar pushes us closer towards our goal. </p>

<p>Hello all! My name is Mary Bruhand and I've loved cartoons since I was a child. For a large portion of my life, I've wanted to be a voice actor and a writer but sadly, circumstances have made it hard for me to do either professionally. I hope to finally introduce one of my stories to the world via the power of the internet and I need your help! I've been paying a very close friend of mine to design graphics for a website (due to go up December 12th) out-of-pocket and another close friend of mine who is also passionate about the project has helped me to program it. I've already reserved the domain with 1and1 Internet and I'm really excited to see this become a reality! Unfortunately, I'm not made of money and I'd love to see support for my project from people who are as passionate as I am!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've got high ambitions and high ambitions require lots of moolah. However, I'm also choosing to be humble and not ask for anymore than the bare minimum. I've already paid out just over $300 for my artist and would love to pay my programmer if I raise more than that! Any extra I raise will go to paying for the website and the more money I get, the more I'll be able to pay my artist and the more often we'll be able to pump out strips!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My current, highly ambitious goal would be around $10,000. That would cover the website, the programming, the campaign perks and my artist for the first 100 strips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This won't be easy but I like a challenge!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you get in return? If this campaign succeeds then you will have a solid webcomic. Unfortunately, the creator and the artist are both busy so the schedule will start at one page per month. Once they settle into the routine, they'll be able to bump up the schedule to twice a month and maybe someday soon, we'll see once every single week!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You'll also get all sorts of OTHER neat little nik naks as listed on the side of the page!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong>When You Can Expect Your Perks</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, Mary Bruhand works full time (while providing care for a handicapped boy) so once the campaign ends, it might take a little while to get around to everyone but please don't worry! There's no way that we'll be able to forget someone who helped to make my dreams come true!</p>
<p>Please note: Since some of the perks will be coming from different sources, you may end up receiving certain perks later than others. Don't be alarmed. We haven't ripped you off. The rest is in the mail.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h3>
<p>For those of you choosing the $1,000 mark with the intention of getting a character named after you, please understand that you are just buying a name. (First name only. If you try to submit a vulgar name, I will simply go ahead and use the first name provided by your Paypal.) You are not buying the chance to have your favourite character or a character created by you featured in my comic. Yes, I am responsible for the type of character I assign your name to however, I am not responsible for whether or not the character is somehow offensive or not to your liking. Also keep in mind that just because you paid for the character name does not mean that your character has 'life insurance'. They may or may not live to see the end of the story. And even if they do manage to stick around, they may not get much more than a small cameo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the day the comic is released with your name on it, I will be sure to give a shout-out with your full name available to the public... so don't worry too much. Everyone will know how awesome you are.</p></div>","Short Summary

When You Can Expect Your Perks
Unfortunately, Mary Bruhand works full time (while providing care for a handicapped boy) so once the campaign ends, it might take a little while to get around to everyone but please don't worry! There's no way that we'll be able to forget someone who helped to make my dreams come true!
Please note: Since some of the perks will be coming from different sources, you may end up receiving certain perks later than others. Don't be alarmed. We haven't ripped you off. The rest is in the mail.
 
Disclaimer
For those of you choosing the $1,000 mark with the intention of getting a character named after you, please understand that you are just buying a name. (First name only. If you try to submit a vulgar name, I will simply go ahead and use the first name provided by your Paypal.) You are not buying the chance to have your favourite character or a character created by you featured in my comic. Yes, I am responsible for the type of character I assign your name to however, I am not responsible for whether or not the character is somehow offensive or not to your liking. Also keep in mind that just because you paid for the character name does not mean that your character has 'life insurance'. They may or may not live to see the end of the story. And even if they do manage to stick around, they may not get much more than a small cameo.
 
On the day the comic is released with your name on it, I will be sure to give a shout-out with your full name available to the public... so don't worry too much. Everyone will know how awesome you are.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>We have all had someone in our life ...</h3>
<p>We have all had someone in our life whom we have been forced to watch addiction destroy slowly.  They made one bad decision and spent the rest of their life suffering at it's mercy.  I feel they may have only went down that path because they didn't see themself as equipped to make any other choice, especially saying ""no"" to their peers and going against the grain in a rough environment.  I am passionate about this project because I often felt alone in making the ""right"" choice while my peers got involved in negative and/or destructive activities and I think more children would not get started on the wrong path (that they don't want to start on) if they had support, even if it comes in larger than life heroes and heroines in familiar situations.  After all positive role models have to out number the bad in our fight for our souls and shouldn't we all  be the hero in our life stories?<br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Tonight (6/17/21) on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Z0aSLnzETqdPjUbnkIfKQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Bancroft's YouTube channel</a> at 10:00 PM CST, we will be doing what can only be described as SKETCHAPALOOZA!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Earlier on in the campaign we had sketch cards available as an add-on for $50. Normally sketch cards ar trading card sized and not very detailed. We sold 19 of them. I commissioned Lucas Meyer, the interior artist for Sovereign Wolf, to do a total of 30 of them. These are no MERE sketch cards! Sketches of this size and quality can go for 2-4 times the price of these.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Here's a look: (SOVEREIGN WOLF Graphic Novel just for Scale) </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Tonight (6/17/21) I will be adding a new tier. It will be a Sovereign Wolf book with the cover of your choice and one of these sketch cards chosen at RANDOM. It will be a $75 tier keeping it exactly the same price as before in order to not make previous backers upset. So YES, there will be a limit of 10 on this tier.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">$75 too rich? NO PROBLEM</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If you back the the project at any level before the campaign closes on Sunday, you will be in the running to win the 11th and final sketch, as well as one (1) of everything I've produced for this Clan Destiny Campaign. This will include some very exclusive things so you'll want to tune in to the show for details. We will be live (I'll be there too) at 10 PM CST, but you can always watch the replay for info you may have missed.</p>

</div></div>","SKETCHAPALOOZA IS HERE!
Tonight (6/17/21) on Michael Bancroft's YouTube channel at 10:00 PM CST, we will be doing what can only be described as SKETCHAPALOOZA!
Earlier on in the campaign we had sketch cards available as an add-on for $50. Normally sketch cards ar trading card sized and not very detailed. We sold 19 of them. I commissioned Lucas Meyer, the interior artist for Sovereign Wolf, to do a total of 30 of them. These are no MERE sketch cards! Sketches of this size and quality can go for 2-4 times the price of these.
Here's a look: (SOVEREIGN WOLF Graphic Novel just for Scale) 




Tonight (6/17/21) I will be adding a new tier. It will be a Sovereign Wolf book with the cover of your choice and one of these sketch cards chosen at RANDOM. It will be a $75 tier keeping it exactly the same price as before in order to not make previous backers upset. So YES, there will be a limit of 10 on this tier.
$75 too rich? NO PROBLEM
If you back the the project at any level before the campaign closes on Sunday, you will be in the running to win the 11th and final sketch, as well as one (1) of everything I've produced for this Clan Destiny Campaign. This will include some very exclusive things so you'll want to tune in to the show for details. We will be live (I'll be there too) at 10 PM CST, but you can always watch the replay for info you may have missed.

<h3><u><strong>Introduction</strong></u></h3>
<p>Hi! I’m Lowell Dean. Since childhood I’ve been drawing and daydreaming about superheroes. Most recently, I've put that passion into writing and directing films like <strong><i>WolfCop</i></strong> and <strong><i>Another WolfCop</i></strong> ... but some stories can't be told on an indie film budget.</p>
<p>Inspired by the likes of <i>Venture Brothers</i>, <i>Bojack Horseman</i> and <i>Rick &amp; Morty</i>, <strong><i>The Atomic Victory Squad</i></strong>  is a globe-trotting, world smashing superhero comic with characters that could only exist in animated form. They're a team of unique misfits, forced to defend the earth when all the “real” heroes are violently killed. So WHO are the Atomic Victory Squad? </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536076120/do47g4s5gkuygit4t4uc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>INVINCIBULL</strong> is an alien from a planet where cows are men; think Superman but with giant udders. Since he's a milk producing male, society at large fears and rejects him. Even when he's saving their life! <strong>GARY THE MIME</strong> isn't your average mime. His ""imaginations"" physically manifest, so if Gary points a finger gun in your direction, you'd better duck! <strong>ZOOZANNA</strong> is a world renowned explorer cursed into the form of several animals... all at once.  <strong>BUBBLE MYERS</strong> is a recovering drug addict accidentally fused into a billion dollar government super-suit. <strong>SHE-GIRL</strong> was built as a pleasure-bot then reprogrammed as a sentient, no-nonsense, gadget filled assassin. Lastly there's <strong>TRIANGLE MASTER</strong>.... he just <i>really</i> likes triangles (tri-sexual). </p>
<p>Real talk: The world doesn't need more superheroes, but this is no ordinary team. <i>The Atomic Victory Squad</i>  is a satire of the genre while still working within the confines of it (capes, costumes, superpowers and lots of action).</p>

I’ve partnered with talented collaborators like brilliant comic book illustrator <strong>Javier Martin Caba</strong> (<i>Blood Brothers, Lucha Brothers</i>) and practical effects/sculpting wizard <strong>Emersen Ziffle</strong> (<i>Krampus, WolfCop, Curse of Chucky</i>) who is designing our campaign perks.

<li>We need supplies to create hand crafted perks (badges, maquettes, t-shirts).</li>

<p><strong>Get cool collectables and highly personalized perks! </strong></p>
<p>This is more than just a comic. Emersen is designing AVS collector badges, t-shirts, an udderly incredible Invincibull maquette... and a few more surprises! </p>

</div></div>","Introduction
Hi! I’m Lowell Dean. Since childhood I’ve been drawing and daydreaming about superheroes. Most recently, I've put that passion into writing and directing films like WolfCop and Another WolfCop ... but some stories can't be told on an indie film budget.
Inspired by the likes of Venture Brothers, Bojack Horseman and Rick & Morty, The Atomic Victory Squad  is a globe-trotting, world smashing superhero comic with characters that could only exist in animated form. They're a team of unique misfits, forced to defend the earth when all the “real” heroes are violently killed. So WHO are the Atomic Victory Squad? 

INVINCIBULL is an alien from a planet where cows are men; think Superman but with giant udders. Since he's a milk producing male, society at large fears and rejects him. Even when he's saving their life! GARY THE MIME isn't your average mime. His ""imaginations"" physically manifest, so if Gary points a finger gun in your direction, you'd better duck! ZOOZANNA is a world renowned explorer cursed into the form of several animals... all at once.  BUBBLE MYERS is a recovering drug addict accidentally fused into a billion dollar government super-suit. SHE-GIRL was built as a pleasure-bot then reprogrammed as a sentient, no-nonsense, gadget filled assassin. Lastly there's TRIANGLE MASTER.... he just really likes triangles (tri-sexual). 
Real talk: The world doesn't need more superheroes, but this is no ordinary team. The Atomic Victory Squad  is a satire of the genre while still working within the confines of it (capes, costumes, superpowers and lots of action).

Below the surface, each team member serves as a metaphor for issues like addiction, race and gender identity, chronic depression and mental health. This series is as much about their private lives, personal struggles and relationships as it is about crime fighting.
This is the definition of a passion project. I’ve partnered with talented collaborators like brilliant comic book illustrator Javier Martin Caba (Blood Brothers, Lucha Brothers) and practical effects/sculpting wizard Emersen Ziffle (Krampus, WolfCop, Curse of Chucky) who is designing our campaign perks. Many other talented friends are contributing as well. 
We can’t do this alone. Hopefully our next member is YOU!

Costs = Cool Stuff
This campaign is designed to cover the hard costs associated with our comic and perks:

We need to pay Javier to illustrate and colour the first issue
We need to pay Micah Myers to letter the first issue
We need supplies to create hand crafted perks (badges, maquettes, t-shirts).
The hard costs of printing the comic
Shipping the perks to your door!

Get cool collectables and highly personalized perks! 
This is more than just a comic. Emersen is designing AVS collector badges, t-shirts, an udderly incredible Invincibull maquette... and a few more surprises! 
We also have individualized rewards. We can drop your name or draw you into the comic as a cameo or an actual character! We'll feature your business (or just you, no judgement) in a full page advertisement in issue one.
CLICK on each perk (to the right) to REVEAL MORE DETAILS.

The Real Hero... is YOU
We're pouring our blood, sweat and (happy) tears into this project and thinking long term. For us, this is just the beginning. 
We’re not just making a comic… we’re launching a universe.

This is not our first artistic endeavour or Indiegogo campaign, so we know there is serious work and obstacles ahead. That said, we're committed to making issue # 1 no matter what.
If we exceed our goals, we'll unlock secret perks and fast track the next issue!!


This is a truly grassroots campaign. Your help makes ALL the difference.
If you can't afford to contribute, we still respect you. You can support in others ways like sharing our campaign on social media (don't forget to use the Indiegogo promo tools) or just shouting the words ""Atomic Victory Squad"" at random strangers in the street. 
Thank you for reading. Now let's get the word out and bring these heroes to life!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>It should come as no surprise to people that the UK now have next to no funding for arts. Comedy is now no laughing matter and we are a group of comedians and film makers that are huddled together in the financial cold to make something original and wonderful to put in to the comedy industry. We have worked our asses off, sacrificed many years of hard work to get as far as we have to be told that anything new is a financial risk.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With so little funds it is harder for new and original work to make it to the screen, but we started with the vision to make something great and we are desperate to make this a reality. We are fortunate to have many talented friends who are volunteering out of belief for the project and every pound we make here would go towards making this pilot something truly special. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We will make this pilot! Currently broadcasters are keen to see the finished product but will not be able to offer anything towards it. It's incredibly difficult to pull everyone together on no money during this financial climate, but we simply believe in this and would beg you to believe in it too. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<div>This is a difficult industry to be a part of. If this pilot is made in to a series we will pledge that 20% of our production will be made of paid volunteers who are looking for good experience in television production. </div>

<div>Furthermore, we pledge that in the result of a series that we will always keep our audition process open to the public, not just to profitable faces.</div>

<p>As a team of people who truly understand who difficult this industry is, we are also open to any other ideas that you may have in how we could give back.  As you can see we aim to give directly back to the aspirationals within the industry during these hellish times.</p>

<p>Lights have been quoted at £100 per day x 14 = £1400</p>

<p>My name is G. E. Gallas, and I am a screenwriter and graphic novelist (writer/illustrator). I will be making a trip to the U.K. early next year, and need your help to make my dreams come true!</p>
<p>1. My short screenplay, <em>The Man Who Never Smiled </em>(a contemporary film noir), is being produced by <a href=""http://www.dreamcatcherfilms.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dream Catcher Films</a> in the North West of England. This film is being made on a tight budget, and there are no funds for me to get there. It’s important for me to be there during filming so that I can make on-the-spot changes to the script and get hands-on experience in film production.</p>
<p>2. In between filming will be the perfect opportunity to visit London to research the 18th-Century poet-painter William Blake, the hero of my graphic novel <em><a href=""http://thepoetandtheflea.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Poet and the Flea</a></em>. I plan to visit Blake’s grave as well as various museums that house his works. Seeing his works in person would be life changing. This would be my first time in England, and I hope to make this an unforgettable learning experience.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help cover expenses for transportation (airplane, train) and lodging. I truly appreciate any and all support, whether through contributions and/or spreading the word through social media (Twitter, etc.)!!</p>
<p>While in Europe, I plan to document my travels. When I return, I will share my photos and experiences with all of you through my blog <a href=""http://gegallas.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gegallas.wordpress.com</a>.</p>

Grazie a questo Tour ci è stato possibile incontrare i nostri sostenitori e approfondire alcuni aspetti sul fumetto che stiamo realizzando, attraverso la proiezione delle tavole in lavorazione ed esponendo chiaramente le nostre intenzioni! Ci siamo avvalsi anche di alcune partecipazioni legate al mondo dei fumetti e dell’illustrazione, come la promettente artista Federica Messina, che ora collabora con noi. Inoltre abbiamo avuto il piacere di conoscere una realtà che ci ha supportato con tanta dedizione: Il The Sign, il primo pub steampunk italiano situato proprio dove si ambienta la storia di Sìon e dove ci piacerebbe festeggiare insieme a voi la vittoria della campagna. <br/>Da questo Tour ne siamo usciti soddisfatti e felici di aver ricevuto così tanto interesse verso il nostro progetto!</div><div>

<p><b>SÌON (See-on)</b> is the first <b>steampunk graphic novel</b> set in a XIX century <b>Naples</b>, created by an Italian team and translated in English. The novel is about the investigations of the main character, Sìon, on human-like creatures that come out from the tunnels of Naples. The city has developed the possibility to use the volcano Vesuvius as a huge source of geothermal energy, producing electrical energy and new technological applications.</p>

<p><b>Sìon</b> is our main character, this is not his real name but how the citizens call him. Coming from the Hebrew community of Naples, Sìon experiments on the remains of the creatures caught during the hunting nights. He was rendered physically mute due to an event that will be explained later in the graphic novel. He lives alone in a refuge that is also his laboratory.</p>
<p><b>Ferruccio</b> is one of the few links between Sìon and the outside world. Mechanics and science fiction literature lover, he contributes to the investigations of the main characters. He uses his knowledge to test and improve Sìon's weapons.</p>
<p><b>Mei Long</b> comes from the China Town of Naples. She was born in China and moved to Italy by Eastern Missionary to be converted to Christianity and ready to evangelize her native country. When she was 16 years old, Mei Long escaped from boarding school after she had learned martial arts and traditional Chinese culture.</p>
<p><b>Alice</b> is a waitress. After serving in taverns of port districts, she has been noticed by a wealthy Madam who brings Alice in her estate in the Neapolitan countryside. There she will meet Sìon. </p>
<p><b>Tic Tic</b> is the sound of the metal paw of the neighborhood  kitty. Saved by Ferruccio, it becomes part of the company during their investigations.</p>

<p><b>SIMONE MADEO</b><br/>Graduated in archeology at the University of Calabria, Simone is now attending the specialization school in Matera.<br/>He grew up reading Bonelli comics, Dylan Dog at a very early age, imagining alternative endings and different consequences  for the story, exactly like in gamebooks, his other passion.<br/>He started writing short stories and scripts for comic books in 2011, and ""Sìon"" is his first important project aimed at a wide audience.<br/>The development of a credible setting has been one of the first challenges in facing in this project; it was all about writing a plot as most fascinating and less common as possible.<br/>Simone is also a musician and composed the soundtrack for SÌON.</p>
<p><b>ALESSANDRA LUCANTO</b><br/>Art has always been part of her life.<br/>From the Arts highschool she attended the International School of Comics in Rome, she learned and explored the techniques and aspects of the magnificent art that is the comic book.<br/>After the academy she follows occasional collaborations as a 2D artist for a startup in the Italian capital.<br/>In SÌON, Alessandra is the designer. She edited the characters and the graphical aspects of the setting and the objects present in the boards, after a graphic research as credible as possible. More attention has been given to the expressiveness of the silent protagonist whose facial expressions become an important means of communication.<br/>The attention to detail is then enriched by Sante's colors that are fundamental to create the best atmosphere for the industrialized Naples in the comic and complete the linear Alessandra's linear stroke.</p>

 Italiano

SÌON è la prima graphic novel steampunk ambientata nella Napoli Ottocentesca, realizzata da un team italiano e tradotta anche in lingua inglese. Narra le indagini di Sìon su alcune creature umanoidi che fuoriescono dalle gallerie sotterranee di una Napoli che ha sviluppato la possibilità di sfruttare il vulcano Vesuvio come un’enorme sorgente di energia geotermica, producendo elettricità e nuove applicazioni tecnologiche.
I tempi stanno cambiando
1845. Punto di non ritorno: inizia una nuova era per l’umanità. Enormi strutture si erigono lungo tutto il perimetro del vulcano Vesuvio, producendo energia elettrica che decreta un ciclo rivoluzionario.


I cittadini, ora, sperimentano nuovi modi di vivere la notte, di comunicare tra loro, di spostarsi, di divertirsi e di uccidere.C’è chi osteggia il futuro, chi asseconda il suo arrivo e chi paragona gli umani a dèi e angeli caduti.Considerate l’universo di SÌON come un orologio: in un meccanismo così complesso anche il più piccolo tra gli ingranaggi, se ostacolato da un granello di sabbia, modifica il percorso delle camme creando nuovi, imprevedibili, avvenimenti.Soldati borbonici innalzano barricate e isolano quartieri dove si avvistano terrificanti creature umanoidi.Un uomo indaga sugli avvistamenti e si prepara a scoprire i segreti che avvolgono la città.
  La Storia 
Sìon è un ebreo muto, allontanato dalla sua comunità, che indaga sulle terrificanti creature avvistate nella parte bassa della città, mentre la Guardia Borbonica si appresta a combattere l’emergenza innalzando barricate e mettendo in quarantena alcuni quartieri cittadini. 





Nella nuova Napoli conoscerà altri personaggi che lo aiuteranno nelle sue ricerche: uno tra questi è Ferruccio, un ragazzo appassionato di meccanica che si diverte a migliorare le armi e l’equipaggiamento di Sìon; Mei Long, una seducente ed abile killer venuta dall’Oriente.I progressi tecnologici determinati dall’energia estratta dal vulcano producono nuovi effetti sulla popolazione: grazie all’elettricità, essi iniziano a ""vivere la notte"".Chi sono le creature che infestano la città? Da dove provengono? Nella ricerca di queste risposte, nuove ombre incombono su Napoli minandone la stabilità.
  Il mondo di SÌON e i personaggi che lo popolano
 
Una  struttura denominata ""La Corona"" cinge il perimetro del Vesuvio; essa è intervallata da edifici cilindrici composti ciascuno da alternatore, trasformatore e dinamo chiamate ""Le Torri"".Esse producono l’energia elettrica che alimenta la città sancendo una nuova era per Napoli. La rivoluzione energetica produce nuove applicazioni tecnologiche: la comunicazione a media e lunga distanza viene affidata a congegni basati su impulsi; i vecchi trasporti diventano più veloci e gli scienziati sperimentano gli straordinari risultati ottenuti, determinando nuove frontiere per gli studi sulla biologia ed anatomia umana.Una nuova luce avvolgerà i luoghi più iconici di Napoli quali i Campi Flegrei, i Quartieri Spagnoli, le Catacombe e la campagna napoletana.Chi incontrerai in città?







Sìon. Così è come viene chiamato dalla popolazione cittadina. Proveniente dalla comunità ebraica di Napoli, Sìon porta avanti le sue indagini raccogliendo resti di creature o catturandole durante le notti di caccia. Diventato muto a causa di un evento che scoprirete all’interno del fumetto, vive da solo in un rifugio nel quale ha allestito il suo laboratorio. 



Ferruccio rappresenta per Sìon uno dei pochi collegamenti verso l’esterno. Appassionato di meccanica e di letteratura fantascientifica, partecipa anche lui alle indagini del protagonista. Applica le sue conoscenze sperimentando e migliorando le armi in dotazione di Sìon.



Mei Long proviene dalla China Town di
Napoli. Nata in Cina, è stata portata in Italia dai missionari d’Oriente per
essere convertita al cristianesimo e istruita per essere mandata in futuro ad evangelizzare il suo paese
natio. Mei Long fugge dal convitto all’età di 16 anni dopo aver appreso le arti
marziali e la cultura tradizionale cinese.


Alice è una cameriera che dopo aver servito nelle locande del quartiere portuale viene notata da una signora benestante che la porta nella sua tenuta, nella campagna napoletana. Qui entrerà in contatto con Sìon.







Tic Tic è il rumore che fa la zampetta di metallo del gattino di quartiere. Salvato da Ferruccio, entra a far parte della compagnia, seguendone le indagini.

E poi c'è lui... La Maschera!




Abbiamo deciso di usare un nome generico per indicare questo personaggio. Il suo vero nome ne identifica il luogo di provenienza. Arrivato a Napoli inizia ad acquisire potere ed influenza, controllando alcuni quartieri cittadini, per conseguire i suoi oscuri obiettivi sulla città. Ben presto nota l’attività di Sìon ed inizia a seguirne le tracce.








Un volume prezioso
La graphic novel di SÌON sarà composta da più di 80 pagine, completamente a colori e stampata su un tipo di carta molto particolare: Dolce Vita. Una prestigiosa carta naturale che metterà in risalto ogni minimo dettaglio delle tavole. La scelta di utilizzare questo tipo di carta è stata dettata dalla necessità di ottenere una perfetta riproduzione delle immagini sviluppate in digitale.


 Una delle tavole estratte da ""The Hunt for Sìon"", una breve storia a fumetto ambientata prima degli eventi della graphic novel SÌON.Per la prima volta in un fumetto
Per la prima volta verrà utilizzata una particolare carta, chiamata Dolce Vita, per la realizzazione di un fumetto. La carta è di nuova generazione ed esalta i risultati di stampa, rendendoli simili ad una carta patinata, pur mantenendo i pregi di una naturale.
L’eccezionale risoluzione delle immagini, la brillantezza e la resa finale sono il risultato di una speciale pigmentazione messa a punto da Favini (http://www.favini.com), fornitore di altissima qualità e una tra le aziende di riferimento a livello mondiale nella realizzazione di specialità grafiche innovative a base di materie prime principalmente naturali . 
La rigidità, lo spessore elevato e l’inedito aspetto tattile rendono la carta Dolce Vita perfetta per esaltare le immagini e il contenuto della nostra graphic novel.Ogni tavola sarà curata nel minimo dettaglio, mettendo in particolare risalto la luce naturale da un lato e quella artificiale dall'altro.
La carta Dolce Vita rispetta l'ambiente ed è prodotta con il 100% di energia verde, mediante l'impiego di fonti rinnovabili e riducendo le emissioni di CO2.







Gli Autori







SIMONE MADEO
Prima di tutto un archeologo. Laureato in archeologia all'Università della Calabria, frequenta la scuola di specializzazione di Matera.Cresciuto leggendo i fumetti bonelliani, Dylan Dog in primis, immaginando finali alternativi e risvolti diversi della narrazione, proprio come accade nei “libro game”, sua altra passione.Ha iniziato a scrivere racconti e sceneggiature per fumetto dal 2011, e “Sìon” rappresenta il suo primo progetto importante, rivolto a un pubblico ampio.L' elaborazione di un'ambientazione credibile è stata tra le prime prove da affrontare in questo progetto, così come la scrittura della trama, quanto più affascinante e meno banale possibile.Simone è anche un musicista e ha composto alcuni tra i brani della colonna sonora di SÌON.
ALESSANDRA LUCANTO
L'Arte ha sempre fatto parte della sua vita.Dal Liceo Artistico sbarca alla Scuola internazionale di Comics a Roma, dove impara e approfondisce le tecniche e gli aspetti di questa magnifica arte: il fumetto.Dopo l'accademia segue delle collaborazioni occasionali come 2D artist per una startup della capitale. In SÌON, Alessandra è la disegnatrice.Ha curato i personaggi e gli aspetti grafici dell'ambientazione e degli oggetti presenti nel fumetto, a seguito di una ricerca grafica quanto più credibile possibile. Una maggiore attenzione è stata data all'espressività del protagonista muto per cui le movenze facciali diventano un'importante mezzo di comunicazione.La cura per i dettagli viene successivamente arricchita dai colori di Sante che risultano fondamentali per ricreare al meglio l'atmosfera della Napoli  industrializzata del fumetto e che completano il tratto lineare di Alessandra.

SANTE MAZZEIViene dal mondo dell'illustrazione e si occupa da sempre di rappresentazioni scientifiche legate alla paleontologia, realizzando ricostruzioni accurate di dinosauri e altri animali preistorici, basandosi su antichissimi reperti fossili.Crede che un artista, soprattutto al giorno d'oggi, debba prendere l'impegno di essere il più versatile possibile e debba interessarsi anche ad altri settori, diversi da quelli in cui opera solitamente.Quello dei fumetti è un mondo che segue e lo affascina da sempre. SÌON è l'occasione perfetta per affiancare le sue capacità di illustratore ai disegni di Alessandra. La cura per i dettagli e lo studio dei colori di una fantasiosa Napoli steampunk rappresentano le sfide superate da Sante per SÌON.





Durante il nostro Tour abbiamo partecipato ad alcuni tra gli eventi più importanti in Italia legati al fumetto e non. Siamo stati presenti allo Steamfest 2015 di Roma, al VaporosaMente di Torino, al Cosenza Comics, al Romics 2016, al Napoli Comicon 2016 e abbiamo avuto la possibilità di organizzare degli incontri in fumetterie e librerie del Sud Italia! 



Grazie a questo Tour ci è stato possibile incontrare i nostri sostenitori e approfondire alcuni aspetti sul fumetto che stiamo realizzando, attraverso la proiezione delle tavole in lavorazione ed esponendo chiaramente le nostre intenzioni! Ci siamo avvalsi anche di alcune partecipazioni legate al mondo dei fumetti e dell’illustrazione, come la promettente artista Federica Messina, che ora collabora con noi. Inoltre abbiamo avuto il piacere di conoscere una realtà che ci ha supportato con tanta dedizione: Il The Sign, il primo pub steampunk italiano situato proprio dove si ambienta la storia di Sìon e dove ci piacerebbe festeggiare insieme a voi la vittoria della campagna. Da questo Tour ne siamo usciti soddisfatti e felici di aver ricevuto così tanto interesse verso il nostro progetto!

 English

SÌON (See-on) is the first steampunk graphic novel set in a XIX century Naples, created by an Italian team and translated in English. The novel is about the investigations of the main character, Sìon, on human-like creatures that come out from the tunnels of Naples. The city has developed the possibility to use the volcano Vesuvius as a huge source of geothermal energy, producing electrical energy and new technological applications.
Times are changing
1845. Point of no return: a new era for mankind has begun.Huge structures have been raised around all the boundaries of the volcano Vesuvius, producing electric energy that proclaims a revolutionary cycle.
The citizens, now, test new ways to live the night, to communicate with each other, to move, to enjoy life and to kill.There are those who oppose the future, those who support it and those who compare the humans to Gods and Fallen Angels.Consider SÌON's universe as a clock: in such complex mechanism even the tiniest gear, if impeded by a grain of sand, could modify the path of the cams.Bourbon soldiers raise barricades and isolate districts where humanoid creatures are noticed.You will discover a Naples  that has diverted its historic ways, to start anew, just like we did in creating this comic. A man investigates on mysterious creature sightings and starts to disclose the secret that covers the city.

The Story
Sìon is a Jewish mute pushed away from his community. He investigates on terrifying creature sightings in downtown  Naples, while the Buorbon Guard starts to fight the emergency, building up barricades and isolating some districts.
In this new Naples Sìon will meet with other characters who will help him in his research: one of them is Ferruccio, a boy who loves mechanics and enjoys improving Sìon's weapons and equipment; Mei Long, a sexy expert killer from the East.The technological progress determined by the energy extracted from the volcano produces new effects on the population: thanks to the electricity, they start to “live the night”.But what are the creatures that infest the city? Where are they from? While answering these questions, new shadows loom over Naples threatening the peace.
The universe of SÌON and its characters
Around the volcano Vesuvius, a structure named “The Crown” encircles the perimeter; it is spaced out by cylindrical buildings called “The Towers”, each one comprised of an alternator, a transformer and a dynamo.The Towers generate the electrical energy that fuels the city ratifying a new era for Naples.The energetic revolution produces new technological applications: the medium to long range communication is possible through devices that use an advanced Morse-type code system; old carriages become quicker and royal scientists test extraordinary results obtained, breaking new ground in biological studies and human anatomy. A new dawn will enlighten the most iconic places in Naples like Phlegrean Fields, Quartieri Spagnoli, the Catacombs and the Neapolitan countryside.Who will you meet in this city?

Sìon is our main character, this is not his real name but how the citizens call him. Coming from the Hebrew community of Naples, Sìon experiments on the remains of the creatures caught during the hunting nights. He was rendered physically mute due to an event that will be explained later in the graphic novel. He lives alone in a refuge that is also his laboratory.
Ferruccio is one of the few links between Sìon and the outside world. Mechanics and science fiction literature lover, he contributes to the investigations of the main characters. He uses his knowledge to test and improve Sìon's weapons.
Mei Long comes from the China Town of Naples. She was born in China and moved to Italy by Eastern Missionary to be converted to Christianity and ready to evangelize her native country. When she was 16 years old, Mei Long escaped from boarding school after she had learned martial arts and traditional Chinese culture.
Alice is a waitress. After serving in taverns of port districts, she has been noticed by a wealthy Madam who brings Alice in her estate in the Neapolitan countryside. There she will meet Sìon. 
Tic Tic is the sound of the metal paw of the neighborhood  kitty. Saved by Ferruccio, it becomes part of the company during their investigations.
And then... The Masked One!

We have decided to use a generic name to indicate this character. His real name identifies his place of origin. Once arrived in Naples, he starts to acquire power and influence, dominating some districts, to obtain his murky purposes. He soon notices the activities of Sìon and starts to follow his tracks.

A precious book
The graphic novel SÌON will include more than 80 pages, fully colored and printed in a particular type of paper: Dolce Vita. A prestigious natural paper that allows every detail of the illustrations to stand out. The choice to use this kind of paper was determined by the will to have high resolution, brightness and a perfect reproduction of the images.
 A scene from the ""The Hunt for Sìon"", the debut brochure of the graphic novel.For the first time on a graphic novel!
For the first time will use a particular paper, called Dolce Vita, for the realization of a comic book. This new generation paper will enhance the print results, making them similar to a coated paper, while retaining the advantages of natural paper.The exceptional resolution of the images, the brilliance and the final yield is the result of a special mass pigmentation developed by Favini (http://www.favini.com), provider of high quality and one of the top companies in the realization of innovative graphic specialties based on natural materials.
Rigidity, high thickness and the unusual tactile aspect, Dolce Vita is the perfect  quality of paper for enhancing the image and content of our graphic novel.The details of the boards shine through the colors, that will contrast electrical light against the natural one. 
The Dolce Vita paper respects the environment and is produced with 100% green energy, by totally renewable sources. This reduces CO2 emissions.
The Authors

SIMONE MADEOGraduated in archeology at the University of Calabria, Simone is now attending the specialization school in Matera.He grew up reading Bonelli comics, Dylan Dog at a very early age, imagining alternative endings and different consequences  for the story, exactly like in gamebooks, his other passion.He started writing short stories and scripts for comic books in 2011, and ""Sìon"" is his first important project aimed at a wide audience.The development of a credible setting has been one of the first challenges in facing in this project; it was all about writing a plot as most fascinating and less common as possible.Simone is also a musician and composed the soundtrack for SÌON.
ALESSANDRA LUCANTOArt has always been part of her life.From the Arts highschool she attended the International School of Comics in Rome, she learned and explored the techniques and aspects of the magnificent art that is the comic book.After the academy she follows occasional collaborations as a 2D artist for a startup in the Italian capital.In SÌON, Alessandra is the designer. She edited the characters and the graphical aspects of the setting and the objects present in the boards, after a graphic research as credible as possible. More attention has been given to the expressiveness of the silent protagonist whose facial expressions become an important means of communication.The attention to detail is then enriched by Sante's colors that are fundamental to create the best atmosphere for the industrialized Naples in the comic and complete the linear Alessandra's linear stroke.
SANTE MAZZEIHe comes from the world of illustration and always works with scientific illustrations related to paleontology, realizing accurate reconstructions of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals based on ancient fossils.He believes that an artist, especially nowadays, has to be as versatile as possible, and should concern also other areas, different than those he usually operates in.He follows the world of comic books and he has always been fascinated by it.SÌON is the perfect opportunity to combine his skills as illustrator with Alessandra drawings.Attention to details, the study of electric and solar light and the colors that a steampunk Naples would display including its countless reflections of the sea clouds and smoke, represent the challenges faced by Sante with SÌON.

During our Tour we  have taken part in some of the most important comic book- related events in Italy. We have been at Steamfest 2015 in Rome, at VaporosaMente in Turin, at Cosenza ComiCS in Cosenza, at Romics 2016 in Rome, at Napoli's Comicon 2016 in Naples, and we have had the opportunity to organize meetings in comic-book stores and book stores throughout Southern Italy.

Thanks to this Tour, we have been able to meet our supporters and deepen some aspects of the graphic novel that we created, showing images and boards in progress! We collaborate with Federica Messina, a promising comic artist! We had the pleasure to discover the first Italian steampunk pub “The Sign” that supported us very diligently and where we would like to celebrate the goal of the campaign, next summer. We are very happy and satisfied to have received so much interest for our project! 

Make it happen!
Crowdfunding is the tool that allows us to make ideas and dreams a reality, through hard work and keeping our supporters updated on the publishing and all aspects of our work. We strongly believe in this tool as a vehicle to create a high quality product, without compromises. Crowdfunding is made by people who decide to contribute and support an idea. We strongly believe in the power of each and every one of you; for this reason we have decided to trust in this innovative way of funding, putting professionalism and quality above everything else.

With the money earned by the Crowdfunding campaign of SÌON we will be able to finally make our dream come true, working hard to make the graphic novel, print it in high quality and distribute it to our supporters (shipping charges included in each perk!) in the best way possible, to show you our immense gratitude. We will create an excellent product thanks to Fontegrafica (http://www.fontegrafica.it/), one of the best typographies in the world, that has given you masterpieces such as Lumina and Ernest Egg.

The Crowdfunding campaign is set in “FIXED FUNDING” mode, in other words the final target will be to reach the Goal. If the goal will not be reached, all the donations will be sent back to the supporters.

We have added a Stretch Goal that will allow you to obtain something unique and very precious. Reaching €35.000 everyone who will have pre-ordered the physical copy will have the graphic novel with title and cover in low relief and with an extraordinary light effect similar to an incandescent lava stone free of charge!
Just imagine displaying this copy of the comic book in your personal bookcase: it won't go unnoticed!
Apart from this amazing print effect for the cover of your graphic novel, if we reach the stretch Goal we will also be realizing the e-book that many hoped to have: an adventure that sees Pìon, a chicken that parodies the protagonist of our story, as the main character, a creation by our fan Andrea Tesoro. A digital copy of Pìon's first adventure will be sent out to all supporters


What you will get
We have structured our campaign in 12 perks, so as to satisfy any desires. Each perk will be comprised of exclusive and unique objects, in limited edition, some of which will even allow you to break the fourth wall of SÌON. The objects are: The wonderful Artbook, the Narrator’s Diary, a characteristic notepad with all the sightings notes and the detailed studies of the construction of “The Crown”; a themed Boardgame, a fusion between a Role Playing Game and table game , set in the world of SÌON.

<h3>The Story of Foreign Matter</h3>
<p>Hi there, I'm <strong>Martin John</strong>, a comic creator for the last two years, a comic fan for life. In my day job I am a barber and I cut a damn good head of hair. If you are ever in Toronto drop by the House of Lords for a haircut and a discussion about comics.</p>
<p>So far, <strong>German Ponce</strong> and I have produced one volume of our adventure tale that Kurtis Wiebe (Green Wake, Peter Panzerfaust) has hailed as ""<strong>A balls to the wall story that makes the superhero genre its own</strong>."" One part, the Isle of Doctor Moureau and one part Superman, German and I want to bring you the conclusion of this EPIC tale.</p>
<p>We are looking to make the last chapter of the book,<strong> Foreign Matter Volume #2, 180 pages (about) of black and white comics.</strong> Making this comic has been a dream come true for German and I, it is something that we love to do, and would like to continue doing. We have done this completely independantly of any publisher, but the costs are getting to a point where <strong>I am afraid I won't be able to fund the complete cost</strong> <strong>of Foreign Matter Volume #2 by myself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By contributing, you will allow us to bring you the second volume of our adventure tale to you.</strong> This is something we can only dream of, hope for and come out in public a second time to ask for some funding. <strong>If you have ever had a creative dream </strong> you understand what I am going through, the bittersweet taste of being so close to finishing, but having the fear in your mind that you won't be able to fund it completely, leaving it unfinished.<strong> </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Get Some Comics SWAG!</h3>
<p><strong>The $5000 I am asking for will all go to German Ponce</strong>, so you are funding an artist in his works, someone breaking waves in the Indie scene. He draws for a small page rate of only $60 a page, plus some small promise of backend pay, but this is enough to <strong>keep him in art supplies, food, and a roof over his head</strong> as we work on Foreign Matter. </p>
<p><strong>What you are getting.</strong> Well we have <strong>an entire OGN</strong> that we have completed that you can get <strong>in various forms, digitally, or in print</strong>, all 168 black and white pages. We are also offering <strong>a subscription</strong> that nets you all the comleted chapters of Foreign Matter, and as we complete the new ones, a PDF mailer of the chapters as they are finished. And for those that are willing to wait, <strong>you can get the second completed volume</strong> sent to you. We are keeping this simple. We are publishing a comic and we are offering you comics and a combination of ways of getting them, digitally and in physical form, old and new.</p>

<p>If we don't reach the goal, the money will still go to German, to supporting an artist in his making of art and to funding our comic.</p>

<h2><strong>We Aim To Entertain You!<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong>German and I are creating comics with no higher purpose than to entertain the hell out of you.</strong> If we can do that for fifteen dollars and you can enjoy it than we have done our job. <strong>We are two hard-working guys with days jobs</strong> <strong>that just want to create something that we are proud of</strong>, and that we, and you can enjoy.

<h3>We Are Cloudscape Comics</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Cloudscape Comics Society is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting comics creators in British Columbia. We have weekly gatherings, run events, and make books. We offer our members access to a local distribution network, and information about and access to printers and other services to support their independent comics endeavours. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have produced a comics anthology every year for the past five years. Our newest book is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Giants of Main Street</span>. It will be a giant-sized 150-page book featuring work from 25 local artists and writers. The contributors involved include Edison Yan (Scribblenauts), John Christmas (Spectre of Sound), Rebecca Dart (Rabbithead, Battle Kittens), Colin Upton (Diabetes Funnies), Steve LeCouilliard (Much the Miller's Son), and Jonathon Dalton (Lords of Death and Life). <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Giants of Main Street</span> is a collection of fantasy stories set in an urban environment. It will be our best book yet. The stories are finished and the book is in the process of being designed. All we need is the money to print it!</p>
<p> </p>
In past years Cloudscape has depended largely on donations from our own contributing artists to fund each book. We want to change that. Our contributors have already pledged $1000 towards the printing of Giants, but with your help, we can make this project self-sustaining and move our creators closer to being payees rather than payers. <br/><br/><h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The cost to print 1000 copies of Giants of Main Street will be $4000. With the money we've already raised, we need $3000 more to get there. Our 25 contributors have already donated a lot of time, effort, and energy to this project. One way or another we will find a way to print this book, but by funding a 1000-copy offset press run with a professional printer, we can deliver them (and you!) the high-quality perfect-bound book that these stories deserve. Printing 1000 copies will make the books cost effective enough that we can sell them to book stores, provide our contributors with copies that they can sell at comic conventions, and help Cloudscape promote our talented members to the wide world. Having our creators in print will also give them a publishing credit, a crucial necessity to apply for Literary Grants from the Government of Canada and British Columbia.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div style=""border-color: initial !important;""> </div>
<div style=""border-color: initial !important;"">If we exceed our fundraising goal, we'll be able to print more copies of the book. With offset printing, the more copies you print, the most cost-effective it gets. The more cost-effective our print run is, the more Cloudscape can afford to fund future projects on our own and the closer we can get to remunerating our creators.</div>

<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Giants of Main Street</span> is going to be a fantastic book with fourteen original and intriguing stories, plus loads of additional art and a cover drawn by Steve LeCouilliard and Anise Shaw. This book alone is a worthwhile reward. But with five previous years' worth of work under our belts, it's not the only perk to choose from. We have lots of books that you can own, artists ready and willing to draw commissions, and ebook versions of our three most recent anthologies. Your donation can support some of Vancouver's talented creators, support independent publishing, AND win you some great reading material.</p>

<h3>It's done!<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What a fun ride. This little venture was as much an opportunity for some laughs as it was for any other purpose. Most of my friends got the joke, and really got a kick out of it. Some even went so far as to make a generous gift. To all of you, and especially those that gave, THANK YOU! </p>
<p>This all started because it seemed every day I saw another person starting an indiegogo campaign and plastered it all over social media. Some were downright aggressive in their marketing. </p>
<p>This campaign was largely a spoof of all those campaigns I saw. From the frivolous goal of the campaign, to the outlandish donation perks, to the social media ""blitz"" I engaged in, it was all just to lampoon some of the goofy campaigns I've seen of late. </p>
<p>The difference with this goofy campaign and the others is that the other campaigns were serious about their efforts. Clearly I did not expect anyone to donate $100,000 for my beard in a baggie. Of course if someone had done it, I would have been obliged to shave it, sack it, and send it.  </p>
<p>I also learned about the ""dark underbelly"" of indiegogo. Here on the page through private messages, and through several private messages on linked social media sites, I got a lot of ""pitch"" messages from people running other campaigns. They promised big returns if I would just donate in some cases as little as $5 to their campaign. Making promises like ""Make a $5 donation to my campaign, and I will direct 200 donors to yours who WILL give"". </p>
<p>Pretty shady. </p>
<p>All in all, this was a fun, and eye opening experience. From the visit counts I can see a lot of people visited, and seems a lot clicked through to my IMDB page because my ""starmeter"" exploded during this campaign. Hope I'll be able to make you laugh on the big or small screen again sometime soon. </p>
<p>Again, thank you all for being a part of this experience. <br/><br/>      Sincerely, <br/><br/>                Mario Sellitti</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>PS: There are some good, sincere campaigns on this site, and I encourage you to find them. This spoof is in no way reflective of my view of ALL indiegogo campaigns. </p>
<br/><h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>Like many of you, growing up, I had dreams. Unlike many of you who said, hey that's grossly unrealistic, and I should figure out something more reasonable, I moved to Los Angeles to chase my dreams. While I have enjoyed some success, the road is long, and I have had to take many ""survival"" jobs that I really can't stand. The problems with the current job are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is kind of commission based, and if sales are low, it's minimum wage</li>
<li>The schedule is not flexible, and if I get an audition, I will likely lose my job.</li>
<li>Everyone there is miserable. It sucks the soul out of me to even walk in. </li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, I will lose this job, or it simply won't pay enough for me to continue on, and I will lose my home. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The part where I tell you what you get for helping me:</h3>
<p>So this is where most people offer some random perk for donating. They are usually pretty outlandish, and I promise not to disappoint:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 - I will personally send you an e-mail that says ""You donated $5 to Mario's quit his crappy day job fund, and all you got was this lousy email"" email. Sure to be worth a fortune some day, or at the very least bragging rights. I don't know. </li>
<li>$25 - I will make a post to your Facebook wall either graciously thanking you for your incredibly generous contribution, or go off on a rant complaining you did not give nearly enough. YOUR CHOICE. (The rant will probably be a lot funnier). </li>
<li>$100 - I will make and post a YouTube video to ask out someone you really like on your behalf. (May contian blatant lies, and embarrassing details)</li>
<li>$1,000 - I will write a song about you (Vocals &amp; Accoustic guitar) and post it on YouTube (Will also likely contain blatant lies and embarrassing details)</li>
<li>$10,000 - I will make a short film (under 5 minutes) starring you. (Must be in Los Angeles) You can write the script, or I can. Your choice. (Budget will not exceed $1000)</li>
<li>$100,000 - If someone donates $100,000 I will shave off my beard and mail it to them. Yes, really. </li>
</ul>
<p>I've since added some new ones, and as promised they are batshit crazy. I will keep adding new ones right up to the end, so you best follow. You would be real disappointed if I added a Pants Off Dance Off for an hour and you missed it. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
<p>I thought it would be fun. Donate, don't donate. That's fine. Everyone else has one of these, and I was really starting to feel left out. If when it's all said and done, all this gets is a few laughs, it will be worth it. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>So maybe you're sympathetic, but you're just as broke as me. Here's what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this page with others</li>
<li>Help me land some acting work</li>
<li>Stop watching reality TV</li>
<li>When you see me, tell people ""Hey that guy is awesome!""</li>
<li>Laugh</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Now, according to indiegogo, that's all there is to it. So here's to me celebrating nobeardtober rolling around naked in $100,000. Hmmm... that's probably a disturbing image for most, I probably should remove that. </p>

<h3>So, what's all this, 'en?</h3>
<p><em>Stiffs</em> is a five issue comics mini-series coming out through Deadstar Publishing from December 2011. <em>The Apocalypse Party</em> is written by stand-up comedian Drew Davies, PJ Montgomery and Joe Glass (<em>The Pride</em>), with art by up-and-coming spectacular artist Gavin Mitchell, and colours by Adam Cadwell (<em>The Everyday, Blood Blokes</em>) and Kris Carter (<em>Lou Scannon</em>)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It also features a talking monkey...more on him later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GUNS! MONSTERS! BOOZE! MONKEYS! WE HAVE WHAT YOU WANT!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Okay, 'ou got me attention, butt. What's it about?</h3>
<p>Set in a dead end town in the South Wales Valleys, it follows the adventures of working stiffs Don Daniels, and his monkey life partner (they're just friends, really) Kenny McMonkey, as they discover that the undead stalk the valley at night. Raised on a steady diet of rubbish horror films and heavy metal, they do what any sane person would: become a pair of bad-ass, hard-living zombie hunters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soon though, hunting becomes more than they had bargained for and they are forced to enlist a group of their best friends to become a group of marginally skilled, off-kilter monster hunters.  What follows is a zombie-bashing, vampire-beating extravaganza...wherein adventure and hilarity and some kick ass shit ensues!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Magic, women, guts 'n' gore, and a chain-smoking, foul-mouthed asshole monkey come together to make the craziest, funniest, most kick-ass action comic series of the next year!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Awright 'en, so what do 'ou need?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We want to get this comic into as many hands as possible: that means marketing, spreading the word, merchandise and printing a whole lot of copies!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We also want the comic to spread as far and wide as possible, and at the moment, if you are outside the UK, preordering the series right here is the best way to ensure you get your hands on it. You'll be sent the comic directly from us!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We also want to get it featuring at as many comic cons and shows as possible to help put this in the hands of awesome fans!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This all costs money, so all we raise here will go into making the best comic possible and getting it out to as many people as we physically can!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are some amazing perks for helping out, including comics, art, merchandise and more! So please help!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So, 'ou just want money, 'en?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>No, no, you can also help us by spreading the word!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use Facebook, twitter, Linkd In, Tumblr, Google+ and more to tell people about the series and help us attract new preorders and funders!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tell all your frinds about it and why they should help us make this bad-ass comic book series!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blog it, and hey, we're more than happy to do interviews, reviews and previews, just get in touch!</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","So, what's all this, 'en?
Stiffs is a five issue comics mini-series coming out through Deadstar Publishing from December 2011. The Apocalypse Party is written by stand-up comedian Drew Davies, PJ Montgomery and Joe Glass (The Pride), with art by up-and-coming spectacular artist Gavin Mitchell, and colours by Adam Cadwell (The Everyday, Blood Blokes) and Kris Carter (Lou Scannon)
 
It also features a talking monkey...more on him later.
 
GUNS! MONSTERS! BOOZE! MONKEYS! WE HAVE WHAT YOU WANT!


Okay, 'ou got me attention, butt. What's it about?
Set in a dead end town in the South Wales Valleys, it follows the adventures of working stiffs Don Daniels, and his monkey life partner (they're just friends, really) Kenny McMonkey, as they discover that the undead stalk the valley at night. Raised on a steady diet of rubbish horror films and heavy metal, they do what any sane person would: become a pair of bad-ass, hard-living zombie hunters.
 
Soon though, hunting becomes more than they had bargained for and they are forced to enlist a group of their best friends to become a group of marginally skilled, off-kilter monster hunters.  What follows is a zombie-bashing, vampire-beating extravaganza...wherein adventure and hilarity and some kick ass shit ensues!
 
Magic, women, guts 'n' gore, and a chain-smoking, foul-mouthed asshole monkey come together to make the craziest, funniest, most kick-ass action comic series of the next year!
 
Awright 'en, so what do 'ou need?
 


We want to get this comic into as many hands as possible: that means marketing, spreading the word, merchandise and printing a whole lot of copies!
 
We also want the comic to spread as far and wide as possible, and at the moment, if you are outside the UK, preordering the series right here is the best way to ensure you get your hands on it. You'll be sent the comic directly from us!
 
We also want to get it featuring at as many comic cons and shows as possible to help put this in the hands of awesome fans!
 
This all costs money, so all we raise here will go into making the best comic possible and getting it out to as many people as we physically can!
 
There are some amazing perks for helping out, including comics, art, merchandise and more! So please help!
 
So, 'ou just want money, 'en?
 


No, no, you can also help us by spreading the word!
 
Use Facebook, twitter, Linkd In, Tumblr, Google+ and more to tell people about the series and help us attract new preorders and funders!
 
Tell all your frinds about it and why they should help us make this bad-ass comic book series!
 
Blog it, and hey, we're more than happy to do interviews, reviews and previews, just get in touch!
 
Awright 'en, butt! I'm on board! 'Ow do I help?

dystopian society where the leaders keep the masses in a constant state of
sloth through daily berating and condescending. To escape the oppressive
confines of his world, Colton finds solace in a recurring dream where he is a
superhero. When he puts on a seemingly normal jacket in a store, the barrier
between his dreams and reality is shattered. Armed with his newfound abilities,
Colton finds himself with the opportunity to escape his monotonous confinement
and follow his dreams down a path that will pit him against a dangerous enemy
of the state. But how long can the dream last in a world where mysterious
forces seek to limit the potential of the individual?</p>
<p>Conceived in 2009, <i>The
Jacket </i>is a nine chapter graphic novel that is part superhero, part
dystopian sci-fi. It is the brainchild of writer Jason Biamonte and illustrator
Randy Haldeman, who have been at work for two years mapping out the entire
story. Now, Chapter 1: From the Beginning is near ready for print just in time
for Baltimore Comic Con on August 20. All we need now are your pledges to help
pay for printing.</p><h1>
 What We Need The Money For:</h1><p>Even though we said it in the video,
 it never hurts to explain again. All money will go towards the 
materials to complete the comic, the printing of the comic, and the printing
 of promotional materials. Any 
extra money (though we are trying to not have any) will go directly into
 completing the whole second issue. So even if there is money left over,
 which we highly doubt, it will only go back into this comic series that
 we've worked so hard on for so long now.</p><h1>
 Incentive Clarification:</h1><p><b>PDF:</b></p><p>-The PDF is of the 
entire 22-page run of the comic. There will also be a PDF specific page 
for the ""Thank You""'s, along with the main cover and alternative cover 
by Helaine Crawford. It will look like the final book, but in PDF.</p><p><b>Sketch Cards:</b></p><p>There will be 4 original sketch cards 
drawn. Those will be copied on cardstock and inked individually. They 
will also be colored with graytone markers. So there will be actual ink 
on your sketch cards.</p><p><b>Sketch Cover:</b></p><p>We are limiting 
these because...well, who doesn't love limited edition things? Randy 
will draw a sketch on the cover of anything you want. If you just want 
something that pertains to the story, that is okay. If you want more, he
 is all ears! </p><p><b>Short Film:</b></p><p>The short film will be 
filmed before the end of this project campaign. We will be distributing 
it both through digital and DVD formats. Obviously the DVD will cost 
money to create, and ship so it will cost more to get it. The story of 
the film is based on the comic, written and filmed by Randy and Jason, 
as well as a bunch of other awesome Keyhole Comics Studio helpers!</p><p><b>Original 5-Page ""Dream"" Sequence Pages:</b></p><p>These 
pages were done during the inception of The Jacket. They are old in 
terms of Randy's art and characters have changed since then. They are 
the precursor to the first 5 pages of the new version of the comic. <br/></p><p><b>Original NEW Pages:</b></p><p>There are 21 pages in the new 
version of the comic (the one you are helping to get printed). As we 
ship out the packages for people with the original artwork pages, we 
will choose a page at random to put into the packaging. (If you have a 
preference on page at a later date, then it might accidentally slip into
 your package)</p><h1>
 Baltimore Comic-Con 2011:</h1><p>If you are able to attend Baltimore 
Comic-Con on August 20-21, 2011, we'd love to have you stop by and see 
the fruits of your labor! If you plan on going we want to know so that 
we can just hand over your package there (to save on shipping costs). 
Also, we'll put a little something special in the package just for those
 of you who can actually come to BCC and support us!</p><h1>
 Shipping:</h1><p>We will not charge for shipping, but if you live 
outside of the continental United States, we may have to ask for a bit 
of assistance depending on the tier you select. If you are outside the

<h3>Saving Neil the Horse</h3>
<p>Greetings from Hermes Press! We are a comic book and popular culture art publisher based in New Castle, Pennsylvania. We are a family business that has existed since 2001, and run our company with only 3 full-time employees, along with our unpaid office-dog Moose. Over the years HP has reprinted such titles as <b>The Phantom</b>, <b>Buck Rogers</b>, and <b>Dark Shadows</b>. We have also dabbled in new works such as <b>Scratch9</b>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Our newest reprint project, Neil the Horse, is a reprint of the much-beloved  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">1980s Canadian comic book series created by Arn Saba (now Katherine Collins).  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Hermes Press wants to print Neil the Horse, but to do that we need your help!  </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are already working on restoring the pages, but don’t have the dedicated funds to print the book. Until we do, it’ll just be sitting on our desktops! </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By helping us fund this project, you will be saving an iconic series. Neil the Horse  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">will always be in comics history. But we want more for our horsey hero. How </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">about letting him live again?</span></p>
<p>Neil and his friends Soapy and Mam’selle Poupée are an always-struggling songand-dance act. To gain success, they will go anywhere, do anything, and put up  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">with anything — like a trip to Hell, or captivity inside a video game, or a gang of  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">slap-happy aliens in a stunt-driving saucer. Oh, and a drunken and disorderly  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">back-up band of cats.</span></p>
<p>Neil is a happy go-lucky (and not too bright) horse with a mania for bananas.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">He’s one heck of a tap-dancer and singer, and he can also get down to breakdancing. He adores his two pals, and will do anything for them. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Mam'selle Poupée is a romantic and lovelorn living doll from France, whose </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">wooden body is jointed with hinges. With red circles on her cheeks, curly blonde </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hair, and large bust, Poupée appears to be a cross between Raggedy Ann and </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Dolly Parton. She is a serious dancer, and practices at the studio every day.</span></p>

Greetings from Hermes Press! We are a comic book and popular culture art publisher based in New Castle, Pennsylvania. We are a family business that has existed since 2001, and run our company with only 3 full-time employees, along with our unpaid office-dog Moose. Over the years HP has reprinted such titles as The Phantom, Buck Rogers, and Dark Shadows. We have also dabbled in new works such as Scratch9. 

Our newest reprint project, Neil the Horse, is a reprint of the much-beloved  1980s Canadian comic book series created by Arn Saba (now Katherine Collins).  Hermes Press wants to print Neil the Horse, but to do that we need your help!  
We are already working on restoring the pages, but don’t have the dedicated funds to print the book. Until we do, it’ll just be sitting on our desktops! By helping us fund this project, you will be saving an iconic series. Neil the Horse  will always be in comics history. But we want more for our horsey hero. How about letting him live again?
Neil and his friends Soapy and Mam’selle Poupée are an always-struggling songand-dance act. To gain success, they will go anywhere, do anything, and put up  with anything — like a trip to Hell, or captivity inside a video game, or a gang of  slap-happy aliens in a stunt-driving saucer. Oh, and a drunken and disorderly  back-up band of cats.
Neil is a happy go-lucky (and not too bright) horse with a mania for bananas.  He’s one heck of a tap-dancer and singer, and he can also get down to breakdancing. He adores his two pals, and will do anything for them. 
Mam'selle Poupée is a romantic and lovelorn living doll from France, whose wooden body is jointed with hinges. With red circles on her cheeks, curly blonde hair, and large bust, Poupée appears to be a cross between Raggedy Ann and Dolly Parton. She is a serious dancer, and practices at the studio every day.
Soapy is a street-wise and cynical (with a heart of gold) orange alley cat, a cigarsmoker and a drinker, who serves as their trumpet player, manager and the brains of the operation. Neil thinks that Soapy is the smartest guy in the world . . . and he just might be right.
The book includes an introduction by Trina Robbins, and brand-new commentary by Neil’s creator, Katherine Collins. There’s also some rare art, and souvenirs of the early career of Neil.
Help us help you get this project started so that we can successfully reprint Neil the Horse!




What We Need & What You Get
So what exactly do we need this money for? All of our work in done in-house, so that's already paid for by our boss, but we are lacking funding in one very specific area: printing. The cost to print this kind of book is pretty high if we do it correctly (and we want it done correctly!)
We want $15,000 to pay for printing the book, as well as shipping it back to the United States (we print in China). None of this money will go to anything but our printing costs, because we want, more than anything, to preserve this comic series.
If you help us, beyond the satisfaction of knowing that you put your money to a good cause, you can also get a copy of the finished book if we get funding! 
We want to keep this simple and keep costs down, so the only real perks are the regular edition of the comic book reprint or the special limited edition version, with extra pages, and signed by Katherine Collins. The regular edition is priced currently at $60.00, and the limited edition at $95.00. You'll also get your name in the Thanks page if you donate $25 or more!


The Impact
Every project Hermes Press has done has been a success. This time we decided to reach out to the fans, old and new alike, and see if they'd like to be a part of the process from the beginning, instead of just at the bookstore.
By reprinting Neil the Horse you will be helping preserve a unique comic creation. Not to mention Making the World Safe for Musical Comedy, of course!

<p><span>My name is Kamau Mshale, I'm an artist and comic book creator from Philly. Many black comic book fans will complain about the black characters in comics today. They are stereotypes or they don’t look like African Americans or they are sidekicks and not prominent enough.  There are lots of reasons but it boils down lack of exposure for the many independent characters by smaller creators who intentionally fill these voids. So this is the start of my campaign to create a character and have her transcend the underground and indie-comic section and become a American cultural icon.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Create a cultural icon?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Not just for me, or black people but for young women and little girls and little boys and young men whose standard of beauty and body image, is being shaped every day. Just not in a positive way.  A recent study showed that the self image of African American youth has not changed much since 50's. </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybDa0gSuAcg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybDa0gSuAcg</span></a><span> <br/> The size and shape of women is constantly being scrutinized and the black woman even more so. It was the labeling of world class athletes and models as ""fat"" that prompted me to create an image that speaks to the shape of many women and a lot of them African America. Women who are by no means fat or out of shape or obese but don’t fit the BMI standards or what is shown in media as “in shape”.<br/><br/></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Great but what does that really mean?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I've seen firsthand the smiles created by Captain Kacela on little black girls.  The look of a person greatly impacts self esteem. When you don't see yourself in the places of power in video games, fiction books, comic books, movies or even music, imagine what that could do to yourself image and self esteem. There have been some efforts to consciously boost that image, this is one step in that line and every step is important. I want to add this positive character to the worlds collective thoughts and give young women one more positive reflection and I need help.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How you can help?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I've been working on it. I’m drawing inking digitally editing everything. There are  some road blocks: Production Distribution and Advertising. A lot of the problem is the amount of money I’m able to put in. I can only buy a small amount of books. I haven’t done any real advertising yet. The majority of the money will go to printing a larger volume of quality books, will go to paying for advertising, online and a few convention tables.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Awesome but your broke.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It’s not all about money though. If you can’t contribute please help by telling people about Kacela (ka-chay-la). She doesn’t mean anything if she isn’t a idea that people know about. She is about accepting and loving who you are and not falling victim to the idea that there’s only one look that equals beauty. Every one you tell every time someone talks about the character what she was created for or buys a book it helps tremendously.</span></p></div>","Who me?

<p>Hello! I'm Nathan Fehr, creator of <a href=""http://interestingtimes.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""my site!"">Interesting Times</a>. I've been drawing for as long as I can remember, and writing journal comics on a regular basis for the past seven years. I love getting to do this and over time have built a small but loyal fanbase. Honestly I've never had aspirations of fame, but I <em>have</em> always thought it'd be awesome to see my work in print.</p>
<p>Around a year ago a friend of mine and his wife told me they wanted to help with that dream. They were getting into the idea of independent press, they told me, and with so much available material my site was practically book-ready! </p>
<p>And so I got to work digging out old files, compiling commentary and getting everything ready. At long last I'm proud to announce that we're ready to get this thing published and start sellin' copies!</p>

<p>So in return for helping us make this a reality, we want to give you the credit you deserve: your name in the book, cool extras like stickers, pins, and some of the most beloved Interesting Times web banners as prints for supporters! Best of all, the perk for a $35 pledge is the physical printed book itself. And for $60 you get an Indiegogo exclusive Ninja Edition with custom drawings by the author!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Chris Hicks. I'm a screenwriter and filmmaker with over twelve years of experience under my belt. Crafting this story has been a passion of mine for over six years. As a comic book lover all my life, I wanted to create a story that would be familiar, yet stand on its own. Dark Hero is about the dark side of being a ""superhero"". It's about the ""What If's"". If the city you sacrificed everything for and protected for years, turned its back on you--what would you become? What if they need you back? This is a story that deserves to be told. We are very proud to bring this story to life and share it with ALL LOVERS OF COMICS. With your help we know this can be something different. Something special!</p>

<p><i><strong>KAMEN AMERICA</strong></i> is the ongoing story about aspiring fashion designer <strong>Charlotte ""Carly"" Vanders</strong>, who finds herself thrust into a world of monster-fighting and heroics, all the while having to contend with media hounds, unscrupulous profiteers, and the struggles of maintaining some semblance of a private life. An unexpected sleeper hit that debuted in the spring of 2020, <strong><i>KAMEN AMERICA, Volume 1</i></strong> raised more than 900% over its initial funding goal between <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ninjaink/kamen-america-volume-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kickstarter </a>and <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kamen-america-volume-1/x/18537204#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IndieGoGo </a>and is slated to debut in retail stores (in a shortened format) <a href=""https://www.previewsworld.com/Catalog/JUL201050"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">courtesy of Antarctic Press this fall</a>.</p>

<p><i><strong>KAMEN AMERICA, Volume 2: The Founding Fighters</strong></i> takes place almost a year after the events of the first volume and months after the tie-in story featured in <strong><i><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/at/blackhops3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BLACK HOPS, Volume 3: Hopocalypse Now.</a></i></strong></p>
<p>After turning down her future prospects with her media rep, Carly is working tirelessly to promote herself while suffering a daily barrage of media smear pieces. Monster appearances have not ended and the mystery of who's behind all of it still remains. Fortunately, this time she's joined by former foe <strong>Misha Lovacova</strong>, who now goes by the name <strong>Kamen Comet</strong>. Things get complicated really quickly when Carly's former agent, Niro Lansky, joins forces the mysterious woman behind the monster attacks: <strong>Vermillion Masquerade!</strong> And if that wasn't enough, a rival from Carly's past shows up to complicate things even further!</p>

<p><strong>WE ARE 100% COMPLETE!</strong> Since last year, we have made it a point to only go live with our pre-orders once the book is fully finished: for IndieGoGo, you have the extra bonus of already having a fully-printed book since we launch our pre-orders after having successfully funded on Kickstarter.</p>
<p>While some industry professionals are consistently late on their crowdfunded books due to a combination of unrealistic expectations, poor time management, and/or prioritization of other dealings, every member of our creative effort comes from a business management world, where it is crucial for us to<strong><i> deliver a quality book, on time, as promised.</i></strong> We offer a small number of reward tiers to accommodate a variety of tastes and budgets while keeping it lean enough for an easy fulfillment. Our rewards for Volume 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i><strong>KAMEN AMERICA, Volume 2: The Founding Fighters</strong></i> 64-page graphic novel. It includes 8 pages of bonus content that any future potential retail version won't have. Front cover by Timothy Lim and Genzoman; back cover by <a href=""https://twitter.com/Knuxyy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jacob Gerber</a>
</li>
<li>A reprint of <i><strong>KAMEN AMERICA, Volume 1: Stars &amp; Strife</strong></i> with a brand new front and back cover by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/aleborgobelloart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ale Borgobello</a> and <a href=""https://ibukht1015.fanbox.cc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IBUO</a>, respectively</li>

<h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING FULFILLMENT:</h2>
<p>We pride ourselves on 2 years of successful crowdfunding and shipping in a timely manner: all of our books between 2019 and 2020 were delivered either a month early or on-time. However, the unique system by which crowdfunding operates necessitates some personal policies to protect both you, the reader, and us the creators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital PDFs are <strong>TIME SENSITIVE</strong>, sent within<strong> 24 hours</strong> of receiving funding from IndieGoGo, which is usually<strong> 4-10 days</strong> after the campaign ends. These files are sent via WeTransfer links, which expire after <strong>7 days</strong>. Due to our busy schedules, we will be strongly enforcing this. <strong>We are not responsible for backers who do not download our files</strong>: we have to be able to focus on other work without taking time out of our day to resend huge files to delinquent backers.</li>
<li>Physical books will be replaced if our tracking data shows that the parcel has not arrived within a reasonable period of time, or if significant damage was done to the books in transit. However, we are not responsible for book inquiries <strong>3 months after the ship date.</strong> After 3 months, USPS will typically scrub tracking data. We cannot be dealing with shipping inquiries 6 months, a year, 2 years after the shipping date: that is not fair to us, nor is it fair to backers who have been monitoring the status of their orders. <strong>The onus of responsibility must fall on the customer</strong> to keep up with our updates regarding shipping schedules and other inquiries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>

KAMEN AMERICA is the ongoing story about aspiring fashion designer Charlotte ""Carly"" Vanders, who finds herself thrust into a world of monster-fighting and heroics, all the while having to contend with media hounds, unscrupulous profiteers, and the struggles of maintaining some semblance of a private life. An unexpected sleeper hit that debuted in the spring of 2020, KAMEN AMERICA, Volume 1 raised more than 900% over its initial funding goal between Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and is slated to debut in retail stores (in a shortened format) courtesy of Antarctic Press this fall.




KAMEN AMERICA, Volume 2: The Founding Fighters takes place almost a year after the events of the first volume and months after the tie-in story featured in BLACK HOPS, Volume 3: Hopocalypse Now.
After turning down her future prospects with her media rep, Carly is working tirelessly to promote herself while suffering a daily barrage of media smear pieces. Monster appearances have not ended and the mystery of who's behind all of it still remains. Fortunately, this time she's joined by former foe Misha Lovacova, who now goes by the name Kamen Comet. Things get complicated really quickly when Carly's former agent, Niro Lansky, joins forces the mysterious woman behind the monster attacks: Vermillion Masquerade! And if that wasn't enough, a rival from Carly's past shows up to complicate things even further!





A few twists and turns present themselves as the cast and world of KAMEN AMERICA continues to expand! We know that you'll find that this second volume truly bests our previous work in terms of storytelling, art, and craft!


WE ARE 100% COMPLETE! Since last year, we have made it a point to only go live with our pre-orders once the book is fully finished: for IndieGoGo, you have the extra bonus of already having a fully-printed book since we launch our pre-orders after having successfully funded on Kickstarter.
While some industry professionals are consistently late on their crowdfunded books due to a combination of unrealistic expectations, poor time management, and/or prioritization of other dealings, every member of our creative effort comes from a business management world, where it is crucial for us to deliver a quality book, on time, as promised. We offer a small number of reward tiers to accommodate a variety of tastes and budgets while keeping it lean enough for an easy fulfillment. Our rewards for Volume 2 include:


KAMEN AMERICA, Volume 2: The Founding Fighters 64-page graphic novel. It includes 8 pages of bonus content that any future potential retail version won't have. Front cover by Timothy Lim and Genzoman; back cover by Jacob Gerber

A reprint of KAMEN AMERICA, Volume 1: Stars & Strife with a brand new front and back cover by Ale Borgobello and IBUO, respectively

An upgraded acrylic standee. Measuring almost 6 inches tall, this is a 2 inch upgrade over our previous offering and features Kamen America and Kamen Comet!

Kamen America and Friends 1st Annual Swimsuit Calendar. This 12 month 2021 calendar features art from Kamen America, RAGS, Punchline, and Black Hops. Showcasing a variety of artists including Luigi Teruel, Matthew Weldon, Sashi Perdigao, Scott Malin, and Timothy Lim!
Original, full colored art by Timothy Lim

<span>Our
goal was not to force the artists to make erotica, but to let them simply
explore the enjoyment and hardships between two female persons without the need

depict a blooming love or interest, while others wanted to go even further…</span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1338714/files/20150330080928-liljor4.jpg?1427728168"" src="""" style=""width: 382.459px; height: 386px;""/></p><p>

This is what we need your help with.

We are

Since this
is an indie project, that means that we have no outside funding to print these
books, other than the gathered help of the participating artists.

If you
choose to donate, for example, 18€ (about 20$) we will give you a physical copy
of the book as a thank you!

Every
little bit helps, even if you’re only able to donate 1€, we will be really
grateful for your support. We also have other perks and gifts for you who
choose to donate, be sure to check them out.

We know how to deal with printers, creators and how to make this project a

Trust us, we’ve got this ;)
What happens if we don’t reach our goal?
Don’t worry. If we don’t reach our campaign goal we will still print the books
and everyone who donated will still receive their books and perks!
All of the
donations that we receive from this campaign will go to the printing of the
books, and the rest will come from our own, the artists, pockets.
Why is this anthology important?
We started
this project because of the lack of stories about love between women, made by
people who themselves define as women. To let us define women’s love stories
without the influence of the male gaze or porn clichés.

<h3>YOU! Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Gavin. I need help printing a comic book. YOUR HELP!<br/></p>
<p> In 2010 I started Soldiers of Fortune Comics. It is something that can generously be called a comic book company. Hailing from the jughandles of northern New Jersey, I am passionate about world building and story telling. I am bad at the arting. That is where Angela ""The Hammer"" Fernot comes in.

<h3>""If ifs and buts were candy and nuts..."" eh, how does the rest of that go?</h3>
<p>You might be saying ""They may be dead sexy but how do I know they have any follow-through?"" Good question! And thanks, I have been blasting my quads more. The reason we are doing flexible funding is because Blackout <i>WILL </i>be printed regardless of money raised. With SoF being an extremely small operation, every penny counts. Any money raised means having more breathing room to pay people, continue making comics, and allows us to buy food that doesn't have to written in quotation marks, as ""food"", on the package. We already have <b>2</b> complete comics. Ironhorse issue #1 and #2 combine to make 60 pages. Issue #3 has started pencils. Total will be about 260+ pages over 8 issues.<br/></p>
<h3>Yeah, great. Mind telling me what Blackout actually is?</h3>
<p>Oh! sorry about that! Too many baseball bats to the head.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Blackout is a complete story (no drawn-out 8 issue arcs here! instant gratification!) in 36 glorious full-color pages. WOW! so big! The major companies are down to like 16! <br/> </p>
<p>Blackout is 100% penciled, 66% inked, and 25% colored. Expected completion is 6 months. 
</p>
<b>WARNING</b>: Nitty gritty world details follow, from inside the front cover:<br/><br/>Blackout started life as the main quarry for the city of Ironhorse. As the city grew,<br/><p>it hungrily consumed vast amounts of stone. The quarry quickly bore down into the earth. Hitting an enormous natural cave system, it evolved into a hybrid of an open pit quarry and mine system. The stonecutters-now-miners spread throughout the underground, turning their underground camps into makeshift towns. However, the grueling work took its toll on the guilds. Illness was common among those who came and went from the mine. Fatal accidents were all too common. The missing people were numerous. With resources becoming harder and more expensive to extract from the mine and the workforce weakening, the entire mine was abandoned. Eventually, the slums of Ironhorse grew to encompass the old quarry, now renamed Blackout, for a more sinister purpose.<br/><br/>A quote from Bala Wong, a reporter from Ironhorse, regarding the subject:<br/>   ""[...]it is currently used as dumping ground for people who are deemed unfit for<br/>society and must be removed. Typically, if a person commits a grievous mistake against the guilds they get tossed into the slums. If they can not even get along with the gangs in the slums, they get tossed into, or run to, Blackout, destined never to return.<br/>   <br/>   [...]The people who survived the fall into Blackout ended up forming gangs of their<br/>own, like those in the slums. These more tribe-like bands keep to themselves and only leave their home base to forage for food and supplies amongst the ruins. Since resources are scarce, any meeting between these tribes while foraging is immediately hostile as they vie for control of the area.""</p>
<p>Sive leads Outcast Family, the largest tribe in Blackout. She refuses to turn her back on those in need despite dwindling resources. After a fire wipes out their food supply, the lives of the entire tribe are in Sive's hands. The only answer is a desperate mission to scavenge for anything they can find in the darkness of Blackout.<br/></p>

We are raising money to print a high quality, tabloid-sized
newspaper, chock full with comics by artists from all over the world. These
contributions aren’t your usual superhero fare – they’re specially commissioned works of underground, alternative and
small-press storytellers, spinning yarns of sad theatre performers, blackmailed
entertainers, plane crashes, wrestling matches gone wrong, flatulent stand-ups,
persecuted human statutes and of four eyed-wonders – plus a whole lot more
besides! If this sounds like the kind of thing you’d like, READ ON!
 
Who’s in it?
 
The Sorry Entertainer features the work of…
 
The Dynamic Duo: Messrs Andrew Cheverton and Rol Hirst
The legendary Lord Brad Foster
The ineffable Master Christopher Fairless
Mr Dangerous himself, David Ziggy Greene
The mysterious Dr Thom Ferrier
The curious case of Jarod Rosello
The wistful Master Jason Martin
The card-shark stylings of Messrs Jordan Collver and Richard
Worth
New York’s finest tumbler, Miss Lauren Barnett
Florida’s own Ringmasters, Messrs Loren Knack and Ron
McVicar
Argentinian mastermind, Loris Z
The stage-ready Mr Matt Reichmann
The ever-suffering Master Nick Soucek
The despairing President Noah Van Sciver
Buskin’ Paddy Lynch
The Inky Devil, Robert MalkinThe excitable Mr Peter Batchelor
Master of Northern wit and ice-cream salesman, Rob Jackson
Diarist and humourist, Mr Sam Spina
…and Simon ‘just whose idea was this anyway?’ Moreton
 
Why on earth are we doing it?
 
Quite simply, we want to produce something that is at once
disposable and essential, tactile and unique. We want to make something fun,
something entertaining, and something that we can pass around the cities in
which we live, proud of the fact that we made it. We also want:
 
-        
to take control of the way publishing happens for people like
us who can’t always get a look in with bigger publishers. 
-        
to help unpublished artists get together and have a chance for
exposure. 
-        
to give people who aren’t always into comics a change to see
what’s happening and to get their hands on something entertaining, inky and
wonderful.
 
What we need and what YOU get
 
We are fundraising to cover the printing and distribution
costs for 500 copies of this newspaper. 
The problem is, honestly, we don’t have the resources to do this on our

line our pockets. There will be no profit if this is successful, because the
total amount will only just cover our costs. That said, if we ARE wildly

<h4><b>Story</b></h4>Autogen is a youtube-based motion comic about a young man trying to make a difference.<br/><br/>As the writer of the project my main goal for Autogen is to tell a satisfying story about the characters and the challenges he has to overcome.

<p>My name is Christopher and I’m a graphic designer from the city of Montreal. When I was in elementary school I began writing short stories and reading them to the class. They were usually of mysteries or of the post apocalyptic genre. Now a little bit older, I still possess a love for writing and illustration, and so I've started to write a book about….robots.</p>
<p>It all began when I joined my sisters for a scrapbooking party. No, I was not really down for scrap booking so I started drawing a robot instead. After a while, one of my sister commented on how cool the robot looked. I realized how many other ideas I had for other robotic creations; from there on, I started drawing non stop. Everyday I had new robots in my sketchpad.</p>
<p>I was <strong>inspired</strong>.</p>
<p>I developed a main character, a villain, an elaborate plotline and of course…a crazy amount of robots. Soon after I started a blog to post the drawings I had done and to give a little background to Neil in Robot City.</p>
<p><img alt=""airship"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://christopherburkartca.ipage.com/neil/layout_004.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""the infinity""/></p>
<p>The illustrations themselves are black and white, geometric in nature and visually multi layered and complex. This gives a very unique feeling to the robots, landscapes and characters in the story. Everything is first hand drawn piece-by-piece, scanned then placed using Photoshop to compose a final image.</p>
<p>I plan on designing a set of books (small books) each with a few chapters inside. I am already finished the first chapter, and now working on the second and third.</p>
<p>The story so far… Neil in Robot City is about a young boy who is brought to Robot City by his Grandfather, a great inventor with many secrets. Along the way the airship they are traveling in is struck by lightning and Neil is forced to evacuate via an emergency escape pod. He lands in a section of the Forest Zone and beings looking for his grandfathers house. Heeding the last words of his grandfather, Neil looks for the journal bearing a map and the guide to this miraculous place. Soon after, Neil befriends a robot and learns that his grandfather has landed somewhere nearby. Neil sets off bound to overcome obstacles, find his grandfather and solve the mystery of Robot City. </p>
<p><img alt=""lab"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://christopherburkartca.ipage.com/neil/neil_1.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Neil in lab""/></p>

My name is Christopher and I’m a graphic designer from the city of Montreal. When I was in elementary school I began writing short stories and reading them to the class. They were usually of mysteries or of the post apocalyptic genre. Now a little bit older, I still possess a love for writing and illustration, and so I've started to write a book about….robots.
It all began when I joined my sisters for a scrapbooking party. No, I was not really down for scrap booking so I started drawing a robot instead. After a while, one of my sister commented on how cool the robot looked. I realized how many other ideas I had for other robotic creations; from there on, I started drawing non stop. Everyday I had new robots in my sketchpad.
I was inspired.
I developed a main character, a villain, an elaborate plotline and of course…a crazy amount of robots. Soon after I started a blog to post the drawings I had done and to give a little background to Neil in Robot City.

The illustrations themselves are black and white, geometric in nature and visually multi layered and complex. This gives a very unique feeling to the robots, landscapes and characters in the story. Everything is first hand drawn piece-by-piece, scanned then placed using Photoshop to compose a final image.
I plan on designing a set of books (small books) each with a few chapters inside. I am already finished the first chapter, and now working on the second and third.
The story so far… Neil in Robot City is about a young boy who is brought to Robot City by his Grandfather, a great inventor with many secrets. Along the way the airship they are traveling in is struck by lightning and Neil is forced to evacuate via an emergency escape pod. He lands in a section of the Forest Zone and beings looking for his grandfathers house. Heeding the last words of his grandfather, Neil looks for the journal bearing a map and the guide to this miraculous place. Soon after, Neil befriends a robot and learns that his grandfather has landed somewhere nearby. Neil sets off bound to overcome obstacles, find his grandfather and solve the mystery of Robot City. 

 
This project means the world to me and I have really put a piece of myself into the creation of the illustrations and the story. It’s a project that is very personal and that is very important to me, and I am determined to see it through to the end. I want to produce something that will inspire my readers and them to create something they are passionate about as well.
With your help and contribution, you will be a constructor in the building and creating process of Neil in Robot City! The funding will be used to cover the costs of new material, proofing, printing and will allow me to work on this project full time. I go through markers for the illustrations extremely quick and I am in dire need of a new sketchbooks (I have resorted to drawing in any corner I can find). However, proofing and printing will be the bulk of my expense as well as my time spent working on this project. Even if I don’t reach my monetary goal, I’m still going to work on Robot City until the story is finished. Every little bit helps so thank you in advance for any contribution.

<p>So
 I partnered online with an artist named Jayant Mall, and we created 
Issue Zero of the Pact Arcanum comic book, starting with the 
chronologically first scene out of all the books.  It was mainly an 
experiment to see how long it would take, how expensive it would be, and
 what the issues would be in bringing the story to life.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>For the sake of the limitations of the comic book medium, I
broke the books down into scenes, and placed them in chronological order, so
that the storyline would be simpler, without flashbacks or simultaneous
plotlines. Issue Zero is the first
chapter of the chronological text.</p>

How did I get into such a weird genre of writing?  It was basically a
 thought experiment.  What would you get if a vampire slayer was turned 
into a vampire, yet recovered his or her soul?  How would they function 
with that level of spiritual dichotomy?  How would his or her allies 
respond to having a vampire in their midst, having known that person 
previously as a mortal?  So I created a story in my mind of how I 
thought that sequence of events would play out.  I added to it over the 
years, including elements of my favorite science fiction concepts, and 
added a new parameter:  What would happen if everyone in the world found
 out?  Most paranormal novels are based on the supernatural elements 
being hidden from society as a whole, or they posit wide acceptance and 
extrapolate what society would look like in response to that knowledge. 
 So what would events look like in that transition period, as 
civilization moved from treating the supernatural as mere superstition 
and fantasy, to accepted fact?  I would bet there'd be some growing 
pains.I played with the various ideas in my head for over a 
decade, just for fun, but I never intended to write them down.  I had 
always meant to write a novel someday, but I suddenly realized that my 
work environment was relatively stable, and my free time was only going 
to decrease in the future.  There’s no time like the present.  But I 
hadn’t written anything seriously for years, so I thought I needed to 
start small, just for practice.  And then I sat down and wrote out my 
playful vampire story.  Three months later, I came up for air and had a 
first draft manuscript in my hands of about 185,000 words (around 760 
pages).  That manuscript was eventually broken down into two manuscripts
 and expanded into what became my first two novels, Sunset and Sunrise.
  That’s glossing over more than a year and a half of editing, of 
course, but that’s not important.  The main thing is, I published the 
first two novels in early 2011.  About six months later, I wrote a 
direct sequel, Moonlight; a novella, Cathedral of the Sky, to expand on certain aspects of the plot; and finally penned the final book in the series, Starlight, in 2012.

Which brings me to the comic book.  I love comic books.  I have been 
collecting them since elementary school, though I haven’t had time 
recently to read them very often.  I thought, why not see if I can adapt
 the material into something that could be appreciated visually.
So
 I partnered online with an artist named Jayant Mall, and we created 
Issue Zero of the Pact Arcanum comic book, starting with the 
chronologically first scene out of all the books.  It was mainly an 
experiment to see how long it would take, how expensive it would be, and
 what the issues would be in bringing the story to life.
For the sake of the limitations of the comic book medium, I
broke the books down into scenes, and placed them in chronological order, so
that the storyline would be simpler, without flashbacks or simultaneous
plotlines. Issue Zero is the first
chapter of the chronological text.


SAMPLE PAGES:


What We Need & What You GetNow that Issue Zero is complete, I know the process is too expensive 
to 
continue on my own.  I estimate that each issue will cost approximately 
$2,000 to cover artwork, and another $1,000 to cover printing costs and 
postage to get the books out to my supporters. As when I started 
writing, the hardest part of completing such 
an effort is to get started in the first place.  I've already taken that
 first step, but I need your help to continue this journey.  Please 
consider joining me for the next step, and hopefully, we can reach the 
end of the road together.
The primary goal of this solicitation is to generate donations to fund 
the artist who will translate my script into art (Jayant Mall, J Labs). 
 I would do it myself if I had the skill, but my gift is in my 
visualization of the story, and then writing it down.  The secondary 
goal is to fund the cost of printing the comic book into a tangible 
final form.  A tertiary goal is to raise enough extra funds to pay for 
postage to get it out to my audience.  It will be a massive undertaking 
to complete translation of the entire story into a visual medium, but 
I'm game if you are.
NOTE:  For taxation purposes, where applicable, the 
sale value of all tangible products including posters, books and all 
other merchandise is stated to be $5.00 CAD for each item.

<h3 id=""FAQ"">
<span class=""notranlsate""><strong><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></strong></span>
</h3>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><strong>Q: Is it true that these perks can’t be shipped internationally?</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate"">A: Unfortunately, yes for most perks. We cannot ship any of the physical perks internationally for legal reasons. Digital perks and experience perks are open to international donors. However, experience perks do not include any international travel. Travel will be the sole responsibility of the donor. To find out if a perk you are interested in is available internationally check the perk copy on the right hand of the page. We sincerely appreciate our international fans interest and we encourage them to still donate to We Can Be Heroes.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><strong>Q: What T-Shirt size should I order?</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate"">A: Our t-shirt sizes are all unisex. Women typically buy a size smaller than usual, while men generally buy the same size or one size larger. We’ve included the chart below to help you out. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/68108/files/20130911113214-Unisex_Size_Chart.JPG?1378924334"" src="""" style=""""/></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><strong>Q:  How often are the perks updated?</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate"">A: This campaign is a little different than our past campaign. We’ll be featuring a different member of the Justice League each week and swapping in new perks each week (and keeping a couple favorites throughout). Best way to know when new perks are out is to follow us <a href=""https://twitter.com/DCComics"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>@DCComics on Twitter</b></a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/dccomics"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>DC Comics on Facebook</b></a>.  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><strong>Q:  Where does my donation go?</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate"">A: All donations are divided between our three nonprofit partners: International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps and Save the Children to help fund their efforts on the ground in the Horn of Africa. Every donation, no matter how small, helps.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><strong>Q:  Can I donate more than once?</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=""notranlsate"">A: Yes. You can donate a thousand times. Not only will you get a cool new perk each time but also you will help bring hope to the men, women and children in the Horn of Africa. However, each time you donate you will have to make a separate donor transaction. </span>
</p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""></span></p>
<p><strong>Q:  I put in the wrong address/zipcode/tshirt size. What now?</strong></p>
<p>A: We're happy to help with this! Email us at <a href=""mailto:wecanbeheroes@lapromo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>wecanbeheroes@lapromo.com</b></a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Q:  I'm super excited about my new variant cover! How will it be shipped?</strong></p>

Frequently Asked Questions


Q: Is it true that these perks can’t be shipped internationally?


A: Unfortunately, yes for most perks. We cannot ship any of the physical perks internationally for legal reasons. Digital perks and experience perks are open to international donors. However, experience perks do not include any international travel. Travel will be the sole responsibility of the donor. To find out if a perk you are interested in is available internationally check the perk copy on the right hand of the page. We sincerely appreciate our international fans interest and we encourage them to still donate to We Can Be Heroes.


Q: What T-Shirt size should I order?


A: Our t-shirt sizes are all unisex. Women typically buy a size smaller than usual, while men generally buy the same size or one size larger. We’ve included the chart below to help you out. 





Q:  How often are the perks updated?


A: This campaign is a little different than our past campaign. We’ll be featuring a different member of the Justice League each week and swapping in new perks each week (and keeping a couple favorites throughout). Best way to know when new perks are out is to follow us @DCComics on Twitter and DC Comics on Facebook.  


Q:  Where does my donation go?


A: All donations are divided between our three nonprofit partners: International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps and Save the Children to help fund their efforts on the ground in the Horn of Africa. Every donation, no matter how small, helps.


Q:  Can I donate more than once?


A: Yes. You can donate a thousand times. Not only will you get a cool new perk each time but also you will help bring hope to the men, women and children in the Horn of Africa. However, each time you donate you will have to make a separate donor transaction. 


Q:  I put in the wrong address/zipcode/tshirt size. What now?
A: We're happy to help with this! Email us at wecanbeheroes@lapromo.com. 

Q:  I'm super excited about my new variant cover! How will it be shipped?
A: Great question. We ship our books in MODERN AGE Mailer Comic Book Mailers (image below). They are constructed of high quality corrugated cardboard and can hold up to 12 comics.



Q:  What if I have more questions?


A: We would love to hear from you. If you have questions related to the perks or a donation please feel free to email us at wecanbeheroes@lapromo.com. If you just have a general comment on the campaign please feel free to express yourself on our Indiegogo comment page.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Threshold Comics was created in spring of 2011 as an independent publishing company to produce, distribute and market comic books and graphic novels.  The mission of Threshold Comics is to create a universe unique and distinct in its vision of comic book storytelling and the way in which comic books are created and sold.  The founders of Threshold Comics believe in the power of storytelling to transport a reader to an entirely new realm of imagination and seek to create an environment where individuals can develop and nurture their creations and present them to fans eager to read new and challenging material.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both Michael and George are life long fans of comic books and superheroes and would love nothing more than to create a universe where their stories may be enjoyed and appreciated by fans who share their love of comics.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The founders of Threshold Comics have made a commitment to produce a twelve month run of their flagship comic book ""Lost Angels"" and hope that this will be the first of many additional titles to come.  We wish to raise funds to offset production and printing costs, which can be significant.  The completed script as well as a large amount of artwork has already been completed, and we have come to this site for the opportunity to not only raise funding to continue the production process, but also as a way to connect with other writers and artists within the independent comic book publishing community, as well as to connect with other free thinking and innovative minded people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The $2500 amount will cover the entire cost to produce a single months issue, including salary to the interior artist, payments to the artist coloring the issue, and to the artist designing and illustrating the cover.  Printing costs and promotion of the issue will come from Threshold itself.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to encourage support for this endeavor, we have come up with a number of incentives:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any donation of $1 up to $9.99 will get you a dollar for dollar credit good for anything available for purchase on our website.  For example, if you donate $8 you will recieve a credit good for $8 worth of merchandise from our website.  It's like getting something for next to nothing. Nice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any donation of $10 or more, and you will get a #1 issue of our premiere comic book ""Lost Angels"" signed by the writer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any donation of $25 or more and you will recieve a #1 issue of our premiere comic book ""Lost Angels"" signed by the writer and with a limited addition variant cover. Cool!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any donation of $50 or more and you will recieve a #1 issue of our premiere comic book ""Lost Angels"" signed by the writer and artist with the limited addition variant cover embossed with a very limited chromium cover.  So Rare!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any donation of $100 or more and you will recieve the entire run of the first story arc to ""Lost Angels"" Spear of Destiny, or the first three issues of ""Lost Angels"" with the limited addition variant cover embossed with the chromium finish as well as a listing on the thank you page in one of the issues.  Whichever you choose, all issues will be signed by the writer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any donation of $250 or more and you will be granted comic book Immortality!!!  Why buy the book, when you can be a part of the Threshold Universe!  For a $250 or more donation our artist will take your likeness from photos that you provide, and we will make you a character in the Threshold Universe, with a guarantee of an appearance in no less than 3 separate issues.  How's that for something to share with others around the watercooler on Monday morning?  Can't convince your friends that it's really you?  No worries, we will name the character after you, at no extra charge!  (Unless of course your name is Clark Kent or Bruce Wayne, in which case we may have to take some artistic liberties.)  There are a limited number of these incentives available so please don't delay. Some release of rights of your image to Threshold Publishing is needed for this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well that is basically it...thank you so much for taking the time to share our vision.  More information can be found on our website.  Thanks so much for your support!</p>

<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Short Summary</strong></span></h3>
<p>Long ago, dragons and humans coexisted  in harmony. However, a conflict ensued between the two races and eventually war erupted. Centuries later, the battle is still being fought. For Halbert Viedelman, reading in the library is more important than fighting. Despite his desire for a peaceful life, Hal is forced by his father to bring the family sword and join the war.</p>
<p>As soon as he embarks on his journey, he stumbles upon a cursed dragon named Howard. To his utmost surprise, Howard grants him a Dragon Tear, a gift that dragons used to give to the humans long ago before the war started. With no real desire to battle, how will Hal use the gift given to him to stop the war?</p>

<h3><span>Halbert Viedelman</span></h3>
<p>Hal is the youngest son of the famous Viedelman family. He loves reading so much and is usually found in the library of their mansion. However, because their family is known for saving the people from dragons, Hal  is forced by his father to help stop the war. He is banned from every library until the war is over. Hal gets easily nervous thanks to his vivid imagination.</p>

<h3><span>Nidelle Geard</span></h3>
<p>Nidelle travels from different villages to help spread knowledge on curing different wounds and diseases. Her ancestor once owned a dragon tear and it helped them learnways to cure using different flowers and plants. She volunteers to helpothers and is rather strict when it comes to health. Thanks to the stories that her family told her, she is able to guide and help Hal decide on a way to use the dragon tear.</p>

<h3><span>Howard </span></h3>
<p>Due to a curse, Howard  is currently in a small form which stops him from using all of his powers. He can’t remember who cursed him and so he is now travelling with Hal in hope of getting back his real form and power. Like Hal, he has no affinity with the on-going war and would rather travel to different places than fight humans.</p>

For me, there are few things more chill-inducing than walking into a stone subterranean enclosure where one's own sanity is locked in a battle of wills with their own eyes and shadowed surroundings. But in a basement, in a dusty box warped by humidity, is where I found New Mutants #1, written by the immensely talented Chris Claremont. This changed my life.</p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This box was in Gary, Indiana, in my uncle's house. It was the top box out of probably a dozen or so other boxes, all filled with comics collected over the years by my father and his brothers. See, my family took us on annual trips to Gary to visit my dad's family. Gary is a bit rough around the edges, so when the sun set at night, I would tiptoe into the basement, grab armfuls of single issues, and sprint up the stairs, certain that the shadows were trying to suck me back down to that moldy hell. Then I'd sit in the living room and thumb through stacks of comics, wide-eyed and wondering what genius could possibly write such awesome stories with such amazing characters. This is when I'd </span>love<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> to say that I decided to make comics. Alas, not yet.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As long as I can remember, I've written and drawn. I over-wrote book reports in elementary school, much to the chagrin of my teachers. I drew the same Iron Man from the '92 Marvel trading cards probably a dozen times. Poetry in junior high, centering around hazy, evil things bent on corrupting man. Oh, and Excalibur (which I drew piercing a helmet). Sketches of anime characters and Batman in high school. More poetry. Love letters that toed the line between sweet and utterly depressing. Half-finished novels as an adult. Four aborted screenplays. And whatever else I forgot to mention.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">But over the past few years, I've had an itch, so to speak. I thought it was to write a novel. My magnum opus. However, it's just not time for that yet. So this year, I sat at my desk (which, until a month ago, was just a pillow with my laptop on it) and wrote an introduction to a comic. Then, I kept writing. And kept writing. Three issues later, and I figured, ""Hey, it's probably time to hire an artist.""</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">And here I am now. I need your help. I've finally found my purpose in life, but I can't do it on my own. I'm asking you ladies and gentlemen to help me hire an artist to turn my words, emotions, loves, and fears into pictures. My goal is to raise enough to completely finish the first issue. In September, I'm going to print whatever I can and take it to the Baltimore Comic Convention to pass around. Hopefully, I can meet some editors and other creative folk that I can network with. Once the issue is complete, I will pitch it to publishers such as Image, IDW, and Vertigo, then possibly release it as a webcomic.

For me, there are few things more chill-inducing than walking into a stone subterranean enclosure where one's own sanity is locked in a battle of wills with their own eyes and shadowed surroundings. But in a basement, in a dusty box warped by humidity, is where I found New Mutants #1, written by the immensely talented Chris Claremont. This changed my life.This box was in Gary, Indiana, in my uncle's house. It was the top box out of probably a dozen or so other boxes, all filled with comics collected over the years by my father and his brothers. See, my family took us on annual trips to Gary to visit my dad's family. Gary is a bit rough around the edges, so when the sun set at night, I would tiptoe into the basement, grab armfuls of single issues, and sprint up the stairs, certain that the shadows were trying to suck me back down to that moldy hell. Then I'd sit in the living room and thumb through stacks of comics, wide-eyed and wondering what genius could possibly write such awesome stories with such amazing characters. This is when I'd love to say that I decided to make comics. Alas, not yet.As long as I can remember, I've written and drawn. I over-wrote book reports in elementary school, much to the chagrin of my teachers. I drew the same Iron Man from the '92 Marvel trading cards probably a dozen times. Poetry in junior high, centering around hazy, evil things bent on corrupting man. Oh, and Excalibur (which I drew piercing a helmet). Sketches of anime characters and Batman in high school. More poetry. Love letters that toed the line between sweet and utterly depressing. Half-finished novels as an adult. Four aborted screenplays. And whatever else I forgot to mention.But over the past few years, I've had an itch, so to speak. I thought it was to write a novel. My magnum opus. However, it's just not time for that yet. So this year, I sat at my desk (which, until a month ago, was just a pillow with my laptop on it) and wrote an introduction to a comic. Then, I kept writing. And kept writing. Three issues later, and I figured, ""Hey, it's probably time to hire an artist.""And here I am now. I need your help. I've finally found my purpose in life, but I can't do it on my own. I'm asking you ladies and gentlemen to help me hire an artist to turn my words, emotions, loves, and fears into pictures. My goal is to raise enough to completely finish the first issue. In September, I'm going to print whatever I can and take it to the Baltimore Comic Convention to pass around. Hopefully, I can meet some editors and other creative folk that I can network with. Once the issue is complete, I will pitch it to publishers such as Image, IDW, and Vertigo, then possibly release it as a webcomic. Either way, I need to release the contents of this dusty box I call a brain. My artist, JC Grande, is a spectacular artist and has been published. My cost to him is $90 per page, penciled, inked, colored, and lettered. Full service for an amazing price. The first issue is 24 pages, but I am padding by two pages in case my script calls for more room. That comes out to $2340. If I don't reach my goal, I'll figure out something. This is important to me, so I appreciate each and every dollar that comes my way.Seriously, any little bit will help.

<h3>Stretch Goal #1</h3>
<p>Having exceeded our goal to print <i>The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot</i>, we are now campaigning to meet our first stretch goal: $15,000 USD</p>
<p>Reaching this goal will allow us to increase the size of the first press run and give us additional funds to promote and advertise our book on social media platforms worldwide.</p>
<p>If we meet this stretch goal every contributor to my campaign will receive two limited-edition bookmarks and a button with their book order.</p>
<p>Please help us get the word out by sharing our campaign link on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and email: <a href=""https://igg.me/at/thepartners5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://igg.me/at/thepartners5</a></p>
<h3>The Mastermind</h3>
<p>Umar Mycka is a seasoned horticulturist specializing in the removal and disposal of Poison Ivy. He has invested much of his life in educating young and old alike in the dangers of this toxic plant.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Graphic Novel</h3>
<p><i>The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot</i> was published free online for 100 episodes. Dubbed “Where Horticulture Meets High Adventure”, The Partners 5 is based on Umar’s own crew of colleagues and the effects that pollution is having on our environment – specifically the way it’s changing the poison ivy plant itself.</p>
<p><i>The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot </i>is full of monsters, giant mantises, action, adventure and educational facts.</p>
<p>It’s a truly original piece of comic book fiction.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537186427/ih0a96xxrfayx2viltbg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>To raise funds for the first edition printing of: <i>The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot</i>, by pre-selling the graphic novel. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537186820/yyvazvtuyjftmib8xk4v.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Production</h3>
<p>We estimate three weeks for production and three weeks for the book shipment to arrive from our overseas printer. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537186917/qghgyf8t0f2dq5qpfnwn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Disbursement of Funds</h3>
<p>After platform fees and credit-processing fees have been deducted from the total, we will use the remaining funds to print <i>The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot</i>. If we exceed our goal, the additional funds will allow us to order a larger print run, and afford us an advertising budget to bring this graphic novel to the reach of a wider audience.</p>

</div>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Stretch Goal #1
Having exceeded our goal to print The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot, we are now campaigning to meet our first stretch goal: $15,000 USD
Reaching this goal will allow us to increase the size of the first press run and give us additional funds to promote and advertise our book on social media platforms worldwide.
If we meet this stretch goal every contributor to my campaign will receive two limited-edition bookmarks and a button with their book order.
Please help us get the word out by sharing our campaign link on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and email: https://igg.me/at/thepartners5
The Mastermind
Umar Mycka is a seasoned horticulturist specializing in the removal and disposal of Poison Ivy. He has invested much of his life in educating young and old alike in the dangers of this toxic plant.

The Graphic Novel
The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot was published free online for 100 episodes. Dubbed “Where Horticulture Meets High Adventure”, The Partners 5 is based on Umar’s own crew of colleagues and the effects that pollution is having on our environment – specifically the way it’s changing the poison ivy plant itself.
The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot is full of monsters, giant mantises, action, adventure and educational facts.
It’s a truly original piece of comic book fiction.


The Goal
To raise funds for the first edition printing of: The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot, by pre-selling the graphic novel. 


Production
We estimate three weeks for production and three weeks for the book shipment to arrive from our overseas printer. 


Shipping
Your order will be shipped by United States Postal Service within two weeks of our receipt of the overseas shipment. The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot is only available to addresses in North America: $8 to anywhere in the USA, $12 to anywhere in Canada.



Disbursement of Funds
After platform fees and credit-processing fees have been deducted from the total, we will use the remaining funds to print The Partners 5: Hostile Heartroot. If we exceed our goal, the additional funds will allow us to order a larger print run, and afford us an advertising budget to bring this graphic novel to the reach of a wider audience.



The Risks
Risks are minimal. The graphic novel is complete and ready for printing. Once we have met our goal and the funds are released, the graphic novel will be sent to the printers and put into production.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Do You Like Religion and Comics?</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered about why you have faith? Or wanted to know more about what that part of your life could mean? </p>
<p>""Why Faith?"" is a wondrous, full-color comics anthology, jam-packed with stories from creators of all faiths, identities, and backgrounds. Edited by Jack Holder, and featuring some of the greatest creators in the business, these 30 stories bring to bear the question of why one should (or should not) have faith, and how it truly changes the very nature of life.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why ""Why Faith?"" </h3>
<p>My background is in how religion and the arts work together. This is because for many years I did not know how to express what I found compelling about church, and yet so contradictory.</p>
<p>The way I found my way back to God was through art. Going to plays, and hiking, and devouring book after book after book. I could see glimpses of God in every page, every sight and sound. It was only once I stepped outside of church, that I could find why I needed to come back.</p>
<p>What these creators have done is try to answer the question of why (or why not) to believe in a certain way. Doing so with art, with compassion, and with a clarity that I believe is inspired by Grace.</p>
<p>This anthology is, in part, for our children as well as for us. As we grow up, we try to determine for ourselves what God has in store for us. Or even if there is a God. Having this book here allows that child to ask questions, and find answers.</p>
<p>For anyone who is still searching and discontented by what one sees, I say that “Why Faith?” is here for you. We are inviting all to have that still-small courage to ask the question of why. You may not find the same answer that I did. Your truth may turn you down a path I had never considered before. And that makes you beloved.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more, please click the <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0gw2ao0j9xe3ug9/AACOVzZTuKUsqZ2zJDun3tDEa?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link here </a>to be taken to a 30-page preview, completely free. Read our works, see the ideas that these creators bring to life, and come back and enjoy the rest of the anthology.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a blessed day.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Creators</h3>
<p>What I cannot express enough is how each of these amazing contributors approached this question. We have had transformative experiences in our own faith journeys, simply by allowing ourselves to try and answer the question. In backing this campaign, you help us bring to life a new way of considering faith. One that brings us together in celebrating our differences and our similarities in the search of the ultimate question of why.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $10,000 goal is to create a true print run. The book is drafted with all of the stories, but what we really need is the capital to make this come to life. </p>
<p>The money will go towards our creators, printing and shipping our rewards to you.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who Are We?</h3>
<p><strong><u>Trina Robbins</u></strong> – “Poppa”</p>
<p>In 1970, Trina Robbins produced the very first all-woman comic book, ""It Ain't me, Babe.""  In 1972 she was one of the founding mothers of ""Wimmin's Comix,"" the longest-lasting women's anthology comic book. (1972 - 1992) </p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, tired of hearing publishers and editors say that girls don't read comics and that women had never drawn comics, she co-wrote (with catherine yronwood) ""Women and the Comics,"" the first of what would become a series of histories of women cartoonists.  She has been responsible for rediscovering previously forgotten early women cartoonists like Nell Brinkley, Tarpe Mills, Barbara Hall, and Lily Renee. </p>
<p>In 2013 Trina was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.  In 2017 she was inducted into the Wizard World Hall of Legends, and at the San Diego comic convention she received the Eisner award for editing the two-volume reprint collection of the complete “Wimmin’s Comix.”.</p>
<p>And, oh yeah, in 1986 she became the first woman to draw a Wonder Woman comic book.</p>
<p><strong><u>Wm Paul Young</u></strong> – “The Power of True Fiction”</p>
<p>Author of the novels, <i>The Shack, Cross Roads, </i>and<i> Eve, </i>and recently released non-fiction <i>Lies We Believe about God</i>, was born a Canadian and raised among a stone-age tribe by his missionary parents in the highlands of what was Netherlands New Guinea (now West Papua).  He suffered great loss as a child and young adult, and now enjoys the “wastefulness of grace” with his growing family in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Facts never tell real stories.  The journey has been both incredible and unbearable, a desperate grasping after grace and wholeness, the pain of trying to adjust to different cultures, of life losses that seemed too staggering to bear, of living with an underlying volume of shame so deep that it constantly threatened any sense of sanity, of dreams not only destroyed but obliterated by personal failure, of hope so tenuous that only the trigger seemed to offer a solution. A few facts also do not speak to the potency of love and forgiveness, the arduous road of reconciliation, the surprises of grace and community, of transformational healing and the unexpected emergence of joy</p>

<p>Aaron William is an artist and the host of the podcast Comics Manifest, a show that launched at the end of 2016 and focuses on the craft of making comics, the people who make them, and their journey that turned this thing that they love to do, into something that supports them and in some cases their families. Not very many hobbies can become something that can pay for itself let alone turn into a career and anthologies are the perfect place for new voices to speak and be heard.</p>
<p>'Cycles' is Aaron’s first published piece. In his own words “I was so excited when I got Jack's email telling me that I was accepted for the anthology and for the topic at hand. My piece for this book is pretty short at only 4 pages, but it proved to be a challenge to present this idea I had about faith in just that much space. I think what I came out with does the job pretty well.” </p>

</div></div>","Do You Like Religion and Comics?
Have you ever wondered about why you have faith? Or wanted to know more about what that part of your life could mean? 
""Why Faith?"" is a wondrous, full-color comics anthology, jam-packed with stories from creators of all faiths, identities, and backgrounds. Edited by Jack Holder, and featuring some of the greatest creators in the business, these 30 stories bring to bear the question of why one should (or should not) have faith, and how it truly changes the very nature of life.
Why ""Why Faith?"" 
My background is in how religion and the arts work together. This is because for many years I did not know how to express what I found compelling about church, and yet so contradictory.
The way I found my way back to God was through art. Going to plays, and hiking, and devouring book after book after book. I could see glimpses of God in every page, every sight and sound. It was only once I stepped outside of church, that I could find why I needed to come back.
What these creators have done is try to answer the question of why (or why not) to believe in a certain way. Doing so with art, with compassion, and with a clarity that I believe is inspired by Grace.
This anthology is, in part, for our children as well as for us. As we grow up, we try to determine for ourselves what God has in store for us. Or even if there is a God. Having this book here allows that child to ask questions, and find answers.
For anyone who is still searching and discontented by what one sees, I say that “Why Faith?” is here for you. We are inviting all to have that still-small courage to ask the question of why. You may not find the same answer that I did. Your truth may turn you down a path I had never considered before. And that makes you beloved.
If you would like to know more, please click the link here to be taken to a 30-page preview, completely free. Read our works, see the ideas that these creators bring to life, and come back and enjoy the rest of the anthology.
Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a blessed day.
Our Creators
What I cannot express enough is how each of these amazing contributors approached this question. We have had transformative experiences in our own faith journeys, simply by allowing ourselves to try and answer the question. In backing this campaign, you help us bring to life a new way of considering faith. One that brings us together in celebrating our differences and our similarities in the search of the ultimate question of why.
 

What We Need & What You Get
The $10,000 goal is to create a true print run. The book is drafted with all of the stories, but what we really need is the capital to make this come to life. 
The money will go towards our creators, printing and shipping our rewards to you.
What can you get?


Art Book - Alongside the anthology, we are also putting forth a 60-page Art Book directly from artists. Each page is created by a new artist, featuring their own exploration into the question of Why Faith?
Being written into Jody Lynn Nye's next book.

Who Are We?
Trina Robbins – “Poppa”
In 1970, Trina Robbins produced the very first all-woman comic book, ""It Ain't me, Babe.""  In 1972 she was one of the founding mothers of ""Wimmin's Comix,"" the longest-lasting women's anthology comic book. (1972 - 1992) 
In the mid-1980s, tired of hearing publishers and editors say that girls don't read comics and that women had never drawn comics, she co-wrote (with catherine yronwood) ""Women and the Comics,"" the first of what would become a series of histories of women cartoonists.  She has been responsible for rediscovering previously forgotten early women cartoonists like Nell Brinkley, Tarpe Mills, Barbara Hall, and Lily Renee. 
In 2013 Trina was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.  In 2017 she was inducted into the Wizard World Hall of Legends, and at the San Diego comic convention she received the Eisner award for editing the two-volume reprint collection of the complete “Wimmin’s Comix.”.
And, oh yeah, in 1986 she became the first woman to draw a Wonder Woman comic book.
Wm Paul Young – “The Power of True Fiction”
Author of the novels, The Shack, Cross Roads, and Eve, and recently released non-fiction Lies We Believe about God, was born a Canadian and raised among a stone-age tribe by his missionary parents in the highlands of what was Netherlands New Guinea (now West Papua).  He suffered great loss as a child and young adult, and now enjoys the “wastefulness of grace” with his growing family in the Pacific Northwest.
Facts never tell real stories.  The journey has been both incredible and unbearable, a desperate grasping after grace and wholeness, the pain of trying to adjust to different cultures, of life losses that seemed too staggering to bear, of living with an underlying volume of shame so deep that it constantly threatened any sense of sanity, of dreams not only destroyed but obliterated by personal failure, of hope so tenuous that only the trigger seemed to offer a solution. A few facts also do not speak to the potency of love and forgiveness, the arduous road of reconciliation, the surprises of grace and community, of transformational healing and the unexpected emergence of joy

THE STORY SO FAR      Oi! Tales of Bardic Fury is a historic fantasy comic set in ancient Ireland that tells the story of Bryan the bard. Before graduating at the great Bardic College in Tara, Bryan must complete a one year work placement in a tiny coastal village in the north that never heard music before called Oi. After a rocky start in his first performance, Bryan eventually found his footing in town as a performer. Under the mushroom-addled oversight of Starseal the town druid,  Bryan starts a band with Servius the Roman slave, Aideen the hurling captain and her little sister Rhiannon the selkie. As music and songs began to spread through Oi, the villagers became happier and the town more prosperous        After accidentally summoning a pod of orcas and leading a revolt against the oppressive tax collectors of Tara, Bryan became a legend in the village. Solstice begins 3 months after volume 1 ends on the night of winter solstice. But as Oi celebrate the new season with a concert and feast, The Druidic Order of Tara bureaucrats plot their revenge. Our bardic heroes will soon have to learn the hard way that If you want to party, you got to pay the piper...
 
The Books
Both books are available during this campaign. Solstice is the newest chapter of Oi! picking up after Volume 1 ends. It is 48 pages and will include bonus behind the scenes concept art and pinups. Solstice will be perfect bound 7""x10""x with a matte laminated cover and black and white manga style interior pages. First edition risograph printings of Oi! Volume 1 are also available. These books are works of art, printed in woad colored ink on paper designed to make each page physically feel like a vintage concert poster. This boutique 5.5""x 7.5"" 136 page tankobon manga sized first edition was originally printed in a run of 1,000. There are only 40 copies left and they're available for sale for this campaign.
You can purchase Oi! Volume One and my other graphic novels as Add-On perks during check out.

 
Where I am with work on Oi! SOLSTICE
I write, draw, ink color and letter all of my comics as well as design the print files. It is a lot of work but I love doing it so that you can get the best comic I'm capable of served up to you. I currently have finished the cover and back cover art as well as 16 pages of story and have the rest scripted and storyboarded. I should be able to get the remaining pages finished in about 2 months.
Perks-wise I am keeping this Indiegogo campaign simple so I can focus on the book and keeping shipping and fulfillment as simple and quick as possible.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
A publisher of ""how-to"" guides in comic book form, designed to help ESOL and adult literacy learners acquire valuable life skills. The idea came about when publisher and writer Nick Xylas was on the Outset Bristol course, which helps people to set up their own businesses.  He had a background writing short informational articles for various websites and magazines, and his classmates suggested he combine this with his love of comics.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I have asked for $3000 as an initial target, to cover artists' salaries and printing costs for 100 copies of the first title in the series, <em>Jhaakob Comes to Earth</em>, which sets up the characters and also serves as a guide to the UK immigration and asylum system. Any additional funds raised will go towards printing extra copies and creating further titles.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Parthenia Comics are designed to help some of the most vulnerable members of society (eg immigrants, asylum seekers, prisoners and adults with learning difficulties) learn some of the skills that many of us take for granted, in order that they can integrate better into society and become more self-reliant.</div>

With the situation with COVID-19 there are greater risks than would normally be present. This is most likely to have an impact on the production and the postage times. We have built in a bit of extra time into the plan to take account of this.
We have also reduced the number of bulky items we would normally offer to help with the postage and try to ensure that as many reward tiers as possible fit through standard letterboxes.

<p> </p>
<p>A little over a year ago, I decided to create 1001 Sundays as an online comic that doesn't use any panels, frames, or pages to go from scene to scene.  Instead, you can read each story in the form of a big continuous scrolling picture where characters and scenes flow into each another in a milky dreamlike way.</p>
<p>Over the past 52 weeks I've told five stories this way, and the response has been really overwhelming and exciting, and I'm super grateful to everyone who's liked my comic so far!</p>
<p>So here I am, a year later, wanting to turn my scrollable adventures into books. </p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>As I kept drawing 1001 Sundays, every issue became more visually challenging than the last.  I wanted to make each story look and feel unique, and the artwork became so insanely detailed that I wanted to create something tangible for anyone who enjoys the art to keep.</p>
<p>I was also eclipsed by how long these stories have gotten.  If printed, each would would be at least 50 to 100 feet long!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So...</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'd like to create five full color, dazzling graphic novels for the five issues I've released online so far:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Meet Roxanne Barley, your seamstress of story (and my alter-ego).</strong> In this inaugural installment of 1001 Sundays, Roxanne tells us how she came to be - not her physical birth - but her incredible identity.  And she owes it all to a woman who died-- because she wouldn't drink her own pee.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Every once in a while you might find yourself on a colorful, geometric, sparkly, dazzling drive through a bright, sunny forest without a care in the world. </strong> But how often do you find psychotic truckers and helpless turtles on those drives?  Believe it or not, for Roxanne, this misadventure is just latest in a long line of traumatic testudine tragedies.  In this issue, Roxanne takes you through the woods and into the past on a suspenseful and eye-grabbing journey that will leave you thankful that you don't have too many turtles in your life.</p>

<p><strong>""This is the story about a lisserd.  A lisserd that died."" </strong> So begins Roxanne's tale of mischief, adventure, and reptilian woe.  In this hand-inked issue you'll find tropical getaways, cities swirling in smoke, and rambunctious reptiles all told through the typewritten text of a 7-year-old Roxanne.</p>

<p><strong>Some people have lucky dice.</strong>  Roxanne Barley has two teeth she plucked from the jaw of a dead horse she found on the beach when she was three.  Roxanne doesn't usually believe in the supernatural, but whenever she travels she takes her lucky horse teeth with her.  And when she hasn't, things have a tendency to get a little bumpy.  Join Roxanne on her first trip outside the United States on a visit to Israel, bringing to the Holy Land the only objects she's ever felt were sacred--her lucky horse teeth.</p>

I was also eclipsed by how long these stories have gotten.  If printed, each would would be at least 50 to 100 feet long!

<p>Hello! My name is Tara Abbamondi. I'm a cartoonist living in the Pennsylvania wilderness with my bearded husband and two cats. I've been drawing since I could pick up a pencil and I've been drawing comics since my high school days. I mostly posted webcomics and it wasn't until 2010 that I ventured into print comics with a one-shot called <em>Puddles</em>.</p>
<p><img alt=""Cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7383/9244156222_cbbc793ebd.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;""/></p>
<p><em>Puddles</em> is the reason I’m here, actually! I’m looking to fund the third printing for the fall convention season: Tampa Bay Comic Con and SPX!</p>

Hello! My name is Tara Abbamondi. I'm a cartoonist living in the Pennsylvania wilderness with my bearded husband and two cats. I've been drawing since I could pick up a pencil and I've been drawing comics since my high school days. I mostly posted webcomics and it wasn't until 2010 that I ventured into print comics with a one-shot called Puddles.

Puddles is the reason I’m here, actually! I’m looking to fund the third printing for the fall convention season: Tampa Bay Comic Con and SPX!
What’s it about? Well, it’s about a young girl named Maggie, who finds she has jumped in one too many puddles when she literally falls into one.
Now she's in a strange place with strange people claiming she's a savior and that she can't go home! What is she going to do? And what do her wellies have to do with this whole mess?
Also, if you'd like to know a bit more, you can read a 15-page preview on my website: 
http://www.tarabba.com/gallery/puddles
 
In addition to Puddles, I’m also hoping to get funds to print another one-shot, On the Morrow.

I drew it during a self-imposed 24-Hour Comic Day just last month. It’s about a novice lumberjack, Roderick, who is jokingly left behind by his companion on an island known as the Morrow. All seems well until he starts to witness the mysteries of the island.

It’s also my unofficial love letter to all the great beards of the world. (C'mon, look at that beard!)
 What I’ll need:

 I need about $500.00 to print what I need, but here’s a breakdown of the costs.
100 copies of Puddles: $248.00
100 copies of On the Morrow: $221.00
Shipping Perks: $30.00+
Indiegogo cut: 4% or 9%
Total: ~$500.00+

 So, with your help and support I’ll be able to get both of these comics printed and ready for conventions this fall! Anything over the funding goal will go towards printing the best-looking books I possibly can.
Also, if we do reach the goal, I will update with additional incentives and bonus perks, which will include commissions, stickers, and even MORE comics! I’ll update on this further if we get closer to funding.

</p><p><b>Description</b></p><p><i>The Day the Cat Got Shot </i>is a 
collection of 15 interconnected short stories, ranging from 5 to 15 
pages. By exploring snippets and conflicts from the lives of the four 
main characters, we come to understand why a cocky secret agent who 
looks like a 1995-era Matthew Modine would shoot a cat and then jump out
 of an airplane with no parachute. (Short answer from the plummeting 
agent himself: “It seemed like a good idea at the time. Oh, damn it, 
this is going to hurt.”)</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/768935/files/20140805161753-panel5.jpg?1407280673"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>(McTiegue and Dorian Marseilles match wits. <a href=""https://www.behance.net/ncolindyer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Art by Colin Dyer</a>.)</i><br/><p></p><div>
<p>I’m sure it goes without saying, but my main goal is for the 
graphic novel to be entertaining. I’ve done standup comedy for the last 
four years, so I hope the sense of absurd and observational humor I’ve 
developed will come through in the novel. On top of that, I’ll be 
employing the storytelling experience I picked up as I earned my 
Master’s in Creative Writing. I find that, in many comics I’ve read, 
storytelling and humor can sometimes be at odds, where one must suffer 
for the other to thrive. My goal is be entertaining because humor and 
storytelling hold equal weight and make each other stronger. I feel this
 will be a strength once we begin seeking publication for the novel.

<p>This is the longest time I’ve ever spent on
 a project. I first started writing and publishing short stories about 
these characters in 2010 and started to develop the project as a graphic
 novel in 2012. It’s been rewarding to spend so much time with these 
characters, as it’s allowed me to explore a lot of different sides of 
characters that, initially, seem like stereotypes. It also lets me 
intersect the stories in some really intricate and funny ways. As you 
read the different stories, you’ll start noticing subtle references to 
other stories, explanations will pop up, you’ll see events from other 
angles. And you get to see people die in sweet ways. There’s this part 
with a knife. Oh man. <br/></p>

lines and watercolors. An underground fight club is rendered in a 
shadowy noir-like style. The smuggler’s descent into paranoia is 
rendered in the semi-abstract. The artists constantly surprise and 
impress me. Working with such a wide array of people in a variety of 
ways—from afterwork meetings with a colleague to look at sketches to 
extensive email threads with an artist 1000s of miles away—has been the 
most rewarding aspect of this project so far. I think this variety will 
create a very unique finished product. <br/></p>

<p><b>SHORT SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>Birth of a Supernova tells the story of the newest Superhero to hit the borough of Brooklyn. Michelle Lee is a normal, Brooklynite. She is a Data Analyst at Chekov Labs.  Her friend and fellow scientist Mark Mathews are both infected by an alien matter labeled Comet 13.  Mark is transformed into an evil alien being with evil powers and is mentored by a fellow infectee, Nom Rot Sin.  Michelle is cured of her infection and given the power of a comet by Nom Rot Sins, nemesis, Cham Luna. Together Cham and Michelle use their powers to fight the evil Nom Rot Sin and Mark create while eluding capture from Chekov labs and the United States Military. </p>
<p><strong>CREATORS BIO</strong></p>
<p>Charlene R. Jones is a Kansas City, KS native. She graduated from Washington High School where she was an active member of the AV club. Charlene later attended Kansas State University where she was an active participant in the Ebony Mask Theater and worked on such productions as Dream Girls, The Citadel and For Colored Girls. Charlene graduated with a B.S. In History, Pre-Law. She later moved to New York where she worked in independent film with such directors as Seth Carmichael, Louie Arribe and Rafael De Musa of New Horizons Theater. Upon moving back to Kansas City, she received her Masters of Secondary Education from the University of Phoenix and Masters of Science in Counseling from Emporia State University. After 15 years in education Charlene decided to work in film and television full time and entered the Savannah College of Arts and Design, majoring in Film and Television. She later changed her major to Dramatic Writing and earned her MFA in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANCE OF THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p>I truly believe that BlackStarr is a important project because it takes an everyday, average person (and through circumstances out of her control) from a hum drum citizen to a super hero with the power of a SuperNova inside.  It shows individuals that they can be anything even if they didn't know they had the right stuff inside of them.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE USED FOR</strong></p>
<p>1. The hard completion of a 27 Page Graphic Novel in full color.</p>
<p>2. Digital Prints.</p>
<p>3. The ability to attend festivals and sell the project.</p>
<p>4.  Swag such as buttons, postcards and t-shirts.</p>
<p>5. Perks for backers.</p>
<p>6. Publicity.</p>
<p>7.  The ability to support other independent illustrators, printers, and artist.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.</li>
<li>Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!</li>
<li>Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Having completed  3 previous crowdfunding campaigns, I analyzed the projects on costs of each project by reward level, number of backers and shipping.  The goal is to reach my  project's full fund amount of  $10,000.  (Assumptions: 250 Backers, average $40 spend ) The cost includes such expenses such as  coloring, lettering and book design (Cory’s labor).  According to my previous Indiegogo data, successful projects have had very small margins of profitability (less than 5%).  I believe in using independent printers and entreprenuers for the printed copy of the project, swag such as t-shirt, buttons, postcards and magnets to support local businesses.   This also includes initial fee's to some of nations smaller more intimate comic book festivals.  This is what the money raised will cover.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Investing in anything is a risk but those who know me will attest that I always find a way to reach my goal.  If we don't raise enough to complete the pages in the allotted time I will create a series of mini-graphic novels that will efficiently tell the story.  </p>

In the summer of 2014, Rusty will be working on a new comic-related motion picture.http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0319207Back in 1993, Rusty was working for card producer Clubhouse Diamonds and actually created the first commercial ‘sketch cards’ in the trading card hobby, and to his surprise, it soon took off and became a world-wide phenomenon. In the past few years, Gilligan rejoined the sketch card arena and has provided cards for Upper Deck, Breygent Marketing, Cryptozoic Entertainment, Cult-Stuff, and many others, including producing his own trading card sets for the “Mac and Trouble” comic book.Coming up, Rusty's work can be seen in ""Dr Who"" and ""David Bowie"" card sets from Unstoppable Cards - a new ""Star Wars"" project for the George Lucas Foundation - ""The Unofficial Dr Who Companion"" by Matt Herring - an upcoming comic about bullying from JGM Comics - and a set of golden age projects for ""Recollection Magazine"".___________________________________________________________________CLICK HERE to download a flyer that you can use to help this campaign...___________________________________________________________________**Mac and Trouble... are actually real-life house cats, my best friends actually.(above: the REAL Mac (left) and Trouble...Mac was born with an ailment called ""Cerebellar Hypoplasia"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_hypoplasia) which causes him to have problems with his movements and he becomes very uncoordinated. He often has a problem walking, and at times falls down. He really can't jump or run, due to these problems as well.Trouble was a kitten that came right after Mac. He's larger than most cats, a little clumsy, but an all-around best friend to the others... whether they want it or not LOLTrouble and Mac got along famously right from the start, giving Mac the only playmate he's ever really known. They eat and often sleep together, and, you really can't think of one without the other.AND THEY BOTH LOVE CHEESE !(above: the recent ""Mac and Trouble"" comics 'The Director's Cut' now available at www.indyplanet.com along with other Rusty Ink! comics)""The Adventures of Mac and Trouble"" is the story of these 'average' house cats who fall through a wormhole in their litter box and land in the middle of the Nexus of realities. But... was it an accident, or were they meant to be there ? Only the evil Professor Wormhole knows for sure.The 'Nexus' is a place outside of space-time, where a mysterious group known as the 'Collectors' base their operations. For all intent and purpose, it appears that they're operating out of a Movie Studio filled with all sorts of amazing characters and props, that interact with reality.During their adventures, you will meet all sorts of characters on their comedic travel through the universe... some familiar, some not. Among them, long lost heroes, movie monsters, and historical figures to name a few, on a wild journey of the absurd.Mac and Trouble have a few issues of their own comic, as well as having been in a newspaper strip, and have made appearances in other comics and magazines.___________________________________________________________________**Rusty Ink... Back in 1982, Rusty had formed MAIN Publishing and went on to produce many trading card and art print projects. Among their releases were the successful ""M.A.I.N. Magazine"" - ""Test Drive"" and ""Sex Drive"" comics (both of which won awards from various comic distributors) - and the ""Wanted Women"" card set.In 2012, Rusty closed MAIN Publishing and re-opened under the imprint Rusty Ink! which currently publishes ""Mac and Trouble"" comics, ""Recollection Magazine"", and soon ""Mac and Trouble Presents: TAILS"" and a few trading card releases.___________________________________________________________________** Rusty has the following appearances coming up for 2014... all of which, the costume would appear at: https://www.facebook.com/notes/rusty-gilligan/conventions-and-live-appearances/419953411408802**Also, galleries of this sketch card work: www.puntogallery.com/rustygilligan**Mighty Titan art courtesy of http://www.redanvilcomics.com/___________________________________________________________________There are many ways to support us!

<p>SITHRAH is an young adult sci-fi about a little girl trying to find her father after their plane crashes in a unfamiliar land. That's when she starts seeing an invisible creature who has been following her around. Is he protecting her or just along for the ride? It's not long until she runs into a young man named Dino who is running from his own ghosts. Will they find the crash site? Will her father be there?</p>

</h1><h3>When Will You Get Your Books?</h3>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">November at the latest! In other words, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS! This will make a great Christmas present for kids and adults. :) So make sure to stock up and add lots and lots of copies as stocking stuffers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Okay, let me backup and explain how this will happen...</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">SITHRAH 2 will be ready to go to the printer shortly after this Kickstarter ends. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping. This means I'll probably be getting the books around September or October. I have helpers who will help me fulfill all the orders again and so we will try to get everything shipped within a month. (depending on how big this campaign gets)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I put November as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario but I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by September and I will start shipping them out soon after that.</span></p>
<h3>Why Self-Publish?</h3>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">People ask me why I chose to self-publish SITHRAH and reMIND. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough, a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first crowdfunding campaign back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print my first book. Then in 2012 I launched a second campaign for reMIND 2 and it raised a whopping $107,500! Although it was a crazy big campaign delivering so many books, it all worked out. Better yet, I now have a distributor for my books which was one of the biggest problems to overcome with self-publishing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The funny thing is now that I have beautiful books published I am approached by publishers like I had dreamed about. I could easily sign a contract with a publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of what's important to a publisher. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn but overall I love self-publishing now. Thanks to Kickstarter and you guys for helping me I'll keep doing this as long as I can. :)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My business plan is to continue printing high quality first-printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see them on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.</span></p>
<h3>Where Does The Money Go?</h3>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Now lets talk about where the money will go. I plan to print 3500 copies of SITHRAH 2 in China which will reduce my costs big time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">3500 copies = $14,000</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Plus Shipping, Fees and Taxes +$10,000 (low estimate)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">FUNDING GOAL = $24,000</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Better yet, if we can blow past this goal then I will be able to unlock other books that are waiting to be printed. :)</span></p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>How often do we turn to the U.S. for sources for comedy? Too often! Canada's smaller population compared to the States makes it difficult for comics to produce Canadian-themed content because the powers that be don't care for Canadian audiences. But we do. Your support will go towards building up a NATIONAL satire newspaper (available online and in print) which will poke fun at Canadian politics, along with world issues subjected to a Canadian spin. Sounds good, eh?</p>
<p>By the way, when we say Canada, we mean ALL of Canada. From British Columbia to Newfoundland. Yes by!</p>
<p>What we're trying to offer is a satire source on equal footing with The Onion, The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, but with Canadian content. Canada's currently available sources of news parody sometimes fall short due to their limited availability (during elections, for example, many of the big programs were in between seasons) or they target demographics which leads to stiffled comedy.</p>

<p>We need money to print our third issue. The first two were well received, but the modest budget we had limited our ability to market and distribute properly. This new issue will be more robust, and we need a bit of coin to see it through properly from print to distribution.</p>
<p>Any money raised that exceeds our goal will allow us to print more copies and circulate them in nearby cities (we're located in Toronto, but we'd love to bring some to Ottawa and Montreal, and maybe other locales).</p>
<p>By the way, did we mention that in the grand scheme of things, if everything goes to plan, this will be a NATIONAL newspaper? For circulation numbers to increase we'll need to focus on our home city first, but plans are already made to distribute in major cities in every province, and  no one needs to be left out. If you can't find The Beaverton in your local coffee shop, you can find it online, or we can send you a copy by subscription.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A CANADIAN PRODUCT FOR CANADIANS: Many other countries have national print satire newspapers. Why not us? Why should we support our neighbours to the south instead of our fellow Canadian comics?</p>
<p>JOBS FOR CANADIAN COMICS: Many Canadian comedians toil away for years hoping that one day they will find a job in the U.S. writing comedy for a sitcom or website, or The Onion. Wouldn't it be great if our community of comedians was able to find work within Canada, producing Canadian content, for Canadian audiences?</p>
<p>On top of this, Canadian produced Satire will give the world a viewpoint of issues going on in our own country and abroad. Satire can open people's eyes to big issues, sometime in more meaningful ways than traditional media.</p>
<p>Check out The Beaverton website (<a href=""http://www.thebeaverton.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.thebeaverton.com</a>) and look at all the hard work we've been doing. This is what we've accomplished using our own money, and countless man hours, toiling away on the web to code the website, creating mockups of our print edition, going on the street and creating awareness by dressing up as a giant beaver... we're hardworking and  you can rest assured that all of the generous donations we receive will be spent in the best way possible. If you think our content needs improvement let us know by all means! But so far we've received great feedback. Creating satire is a complex procedure. We have weekly meetings to pitch ideas and punch-up our content. At the moment this is a labour of love. Help us with the seed money needed to start turning this project into a proper business.</p>

How often do we turn to the U.S. for sources for comedy? Too often! Canada's smaller population compared to the States makes it difficult for comics to produce Canadian-themed content because the powers that be don't care for Canadian audiences. But we do. Your support will go towards building up a NATIONAL satire newspaper (available online and in print) which will poke fun at Canadian politics, along with world issues subjected to a Canadian spin. Sounds good, eh?
By the way, when we say Canada, we mean ALL of Canada. From British Columbia to Newfoundland. Yes by!
What we're trying to offer is a satire source on equal footing with The Onion, The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, but with Canadian content. Canada's currently available sources of news parody sometimes fall short due to their limited availability (during elections, for example, many of the big programs were in between seasons) or they target demographics which leads to stiffled comedy.


What We Need & What You Get

 




 

 
We need money to print our third issue. The first two were well received, but the modest budget we had limited our ability to market and distribute properly. This new issue will be more robust, and we need a bit of coin to see it through properly from print to distribution.
Any money raised that exceeds our goal will allow us to print more copies and circulate them in nearby cities (we're located in Toronto, but we'd love to bring some to Ottawa and Montreal, and maybe other locales).
By the way, did we mention that in the grand scheme of things, if everything goes to plan, this will be a NATIONAL newspaper? For circulation numbers to increase we'll need to focus on our home city first, but plans are already made to distribute in major cities in every province, and  no one needs to be left out. If you can't find The Beaverton in your local coffee shop, you can find it online, or we can send you a copy by subscription.


The Impact
A CANADIAN PRODUCT FOR CANADIANS: Many other countries have national print satire newspapers. Why not us? Why should we support our neighbours to the south instead of our fellow Canadian comics?
JOBS FOR CANADIAN COMICS: Many Canadian comedians toil away for years hoping that one day they will find a job in the U.S. writing comedy for a sitcom or website, or The Onion. Wouldn't it be great if our community of comedians was able to find work within Canada, producing Canadian content, for Canadian audiences?
On top of this, Canadian produced Satire will give the world a viewpoint of issues going on in our own country and abroad. Satire can open people's eyes to big issues, sometime in more meaningful ways than traditional media.
Check out The Beaverton website (www.thebeaverton.com) and look at all the hard work we've been doing. This is what we've accomplished using our own money, and countless man hours, toiling away on the web to code the website, creating mockups of our print edition, going on the street and creating awareness by dressing up as a giant beaver... we're hardworking and  you can rest assured that all of the generous donations we receive will be spent in the best way possible. If you think our content needs improvement let us know by all means! But so far we've received great feedback. Creating satire is a complex procedure. We have weekly meetings to pitch ideas and punch-up our content. At the moment this is a labour of love. Help us with the seed money needed to start turning this project into a proper business.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you haven't got any spare coin for us, there are still many other ways you can help out:

Visit The Beaverton website (www.thebeaverton.com

Ask your local coffee shop/restaurant/hang-out space to carry print copies of The Beaverton
Like, follow, subscribe to our social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Google +, Tumblr, etc...) - this kind of support gives all of the writers a huge moral boost :D

<h3>After 32 years in business...</h3>
<p>Atlas Comics has been building a multi-generational community of pop culture lovers for more than three decades. Like the local tavern or the office water cooler, Atlas is the center of a thriving sub-culture of people who all love the same things: comic books, movies, science fiction, art, history and conversation. The circumstances that are keeping us closed are endangering our community, and we'd like your help to keep it going.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need an influx of revenue, and we're offering discounts on future in-store purchases as an incentive.</h3>
<p>Here's the idea:</p>
<p>We're trying to raise $7000 for operating expenses during this shutdown. We are not asking for gifts, but rather donations that will net you a 20 or 25% discount on future purchases of vintage back issue comics.</p>
<p>Atlas is known for the finest on-site collection of Silver, Bronze and Modern Age comics in Chicago, with over 70,000 issues to browse through daily. New collections and previously archived material arrive regularly. During our hiatus, thousands of classic comics never seen in the shop have been retrieved from storage and added to our inventory.</p>
<p><strong>When Illinois allows a complete resumption of business, we will have a two day soft opening ONLY for those who have donated to this campaign. You can still redeem your donation amount at anytime after, but those first two days will be exclusive to our Indiegogo backers only.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>You are our lifeblood!</h3>
<p>Atlas could not have lasted all these years without the loyalty and support of our customers and friends. I miss you guys, and life is not quite the same without the conversation, energy and humor of the store. Who knows how long this pandemic will last, or if it might return later. This is a way to ensure our unique community will continue into the future. </p>

<h3>This too, shall pass.</h3>
<p>Long ago, those words were written for an ancient Chinese Emperor who asked his court philosopher to craft a saying that would be true under any circumstances. So: this too, shall pass. And when it does, we will be standing. With your help, Atlas will outlast Covid-19. </p>

<p><strong>Hello potential Indiegogo backers, here's some info about the NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1 collection that we are attempting to fund!</strong></p>
<p><strong>NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1</strong> is a collection of the exciting original full color 3 issue run of the comic book series, plus extras. This perfect bound trade paperback runs a total of 94 pages. This book is created, written, and drawn by Shelby Robertson. Interior colors supplied by Steven Oaks, Jesse Heagy, and Shelby 'Cobra Colors!' Robertson.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605083553/p0049vasqcvpio9e0g2e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>HELP US LAUNCH THE NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1 COLLECTION!</strong></p>
<p>We need your help and support to launch this great collection of Shelby Robertson's NINETY FOUR series. NINETY FOUR is essentially me having fun with several tropes from the 90's era of comics, balanced with a bit of new school. 90's comics were the era that inspired a very young me artistically and was *luckily* the era that I got my break into the industry. NINETY FOUR features all new characters that project these retro ideas.</p>
<p>This collected edition contains the first 3 issues of the NINETY FOUR comic book series, including the infamous sideways issue, a nod to the popular sideways issue crossover books by two particular industry giants from the early 90's. Within NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1 you will follow the tales of Ragetality, Slamm, and Clinton. They're 3 time-traveling haphazard assassins whom really can't seem to complete the agenda at hand. This is mostly due to Ragetality's inability to follow basic guidelines. These stories are a perfect introduction to this rag tag group. Also included in this book is a mixed section of original character designs, unused pages, and pin up artwork. This collection is presented in a perfect bound comic book sized format, so will fit nicely with your collection or alongside your other trade paperbacks.</p>
<p>This book is 100% paginated and ready for press, only lacking necessary funding.</p>
<p>Additional perks will be added if specific stretch goals are met, so read through the goals to get an idea of what extra cool stuff we have in mind.</p>
<p><strong>ALL copies of NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1 perfect bound collected editions SHIP SIGNED by the creator/artist Shelby Robertson.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PERKS AND ADD-ONS:</strong></p>
<p>We are offering Foil - Final Encore editions for single issues *1, 2, and 3* of this book. This is specifically for those fans who prefer regular sized 20 to 24 paginated comics rather than collected trade paperbacks. These feature  homage covers respectively, another nod to the era which inspired this series. These are available as a standard perk, but they can also be added individually as add-ons. These single issue editions only contain the original story pages that pertain to that specific individual issue number. The bonus materials section is only going to be found within the full VOLUME 1 collected edition trade paperback. So, keep that in mind when selecting your perks.</p>
<p>There are a VERY LIMITED number of Sketch Covers available that will feature an original head shot/shoulders up/ sketch drawing of one of the NINETY FOUR characters, drawn and inked by series creator/artist Shelby Robertson. Also for the very first time, there's regular blank sketch cover add-ons available for those who are into collecting them for personal custom art.</p>
<p>We are also making a special Line Art edition of NINETY FOUR #1, which has never been offered to the public. This is a limited release book of 25 copies worldwide. It's something uniquely it's own and features black and white artwork throughout. Available as add-on.</p>

This depends entirely on how fast the printer can finish making the books and get all physical copies into our hands following this campaign.

</div></div>","Hello potential Indiegogo backers, here's some info about the NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1 collection that we are attempting to fund!
NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1 is a collection of the exciting original full color 3 issue run of the comic book series, plus extras. This perfect bound trade paperback runs a total of 94 pages. This book is created, written, and drawn by Shelby Robertson. Interior colors supplied by Steven Oaks, Jesse Heagy, and Shelby 'Cobra Colors!' Robertson.

HELP US LAUNCH THE NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1 COLLECTION!
We need your help and support to launch this great collection of Shelby Robertson's NINETY FOUR series. NINETY FOUR is essentially me having fun with several tropes from the 90's era of comics, balanced with a bit of new school. 90's comics were the era that inspired a very young me artistically and was *luckily* the era that I got my break into the industry. NINETY FOUR features all new characters that project these retro ideas.
This collected edition contains the first 3 issues of the NINETY FOUR comic book series, including the infamous sideways issue, a nod to the popular sideways issue crossover books by two particular industry giants from the early 90's. Within NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1 you will follow the tales of Ragetality, Slamm, and Clinton. They're 3 time-traveling haphazard assassins whom really can't seem to complete the agenda at hand. This is mostly due to Ragetality's inability to follow basic guidelines. These stories are a perfect introduction to this rag tag group. Also included in this book is a mixed section of original character designs, unused pages, and pin up artwork. This collection is presented in a perfect bound comic book sized format, so will fit nicely with your collection or alongside your other trade paperbacks.
This book is 100% paginated and ready for press, only lacking necessary funding.
Additional perks will be added if specific stretch goals are met, so read through the goals to get an idea of what extra cool stuff we have in mind.
ALL copies of NINETY FOUR - VOLUME 1 perfect bound collected editions SHIP SIGNED by the creator/artist Shelby Robertson.
 
PERKS AND ADD-ONS:
We are offering Foil - Final Encore editions for single issues *1, 2, and 3* of this book. This is specifically for those fans who prefer regular sized 20 to 24 paginated comics rather than collected trade paperbacks. These feature  homage covers respectively, another nod to the era which inspired this series. These are available as a standard perk, but they can also be added individually as add-ons. These single issue editions only contain the original story pages that pertain to that specific individual issue number. The bonus materials section is only going to be found within the full VOLUME 1 collected edition trade paperback. So, keep that in mind when selecting your perks.
There are a VERY LIMITED number of Sketch Covers available that will feature an original head shot/shoulders up/ sketch drawing of one of the NINETY FOUR characters, drawn and inked by series creator/artist Shelby Robertson. Also for the very first time, there's regular blank sketch cover add-ons available for those who are into collecting them for personal custom art.
We are also making a special Line Art edition of NINETY FOUR #1, which has never been offered to the public. This is a limited release book of 25 copies worldwide. It's something uniquely it's own and features black and white artwork throughout. Available as add-on.

<p>I'm asking for

English and Italian, because in that way I will be able to promote
""Nina's geek-self"" both in my own country and in the
country I'm going to move (UK). </p>
<p>The funds I get
from this campaign will be used for the printing costs of 200 volumes
(100 in English and 100 in Italian language) as long as a series of
gadgets, which are bookmarks, stickers, postcards and posters. I
decided to keep the money only if I reach the goal. If I don't, your money will be automatically refunded. In the lucky case I reach bigger results than I expected, I will use the extra money for promotion purposes, like
rent an exhibit space at illustration and comics conventions, which
will hopefully help my art to gain some audience and feedback. ""Nina's
geek-self"" book and merchandise will also be promoted on the
web and sold on my Etsy Shop. I'd also like to distribuite the volume on

Who am I? 
My name is Silvia Ballardini, best known as Silly (or Silly Lunastorta) and I am a nerdy comic artist and illustrator from Italy. I'm into comics since I was a child and that is the reason why I attended an art high school in my city (Ravenna) and then got an undergraduate degree at Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna. I'm currently working as a freelance illustrator, running my little shop on Etsy and looking forward to having an experience abroad, in Edinburgh. My sources of inspiration are fantasy and steampunk genres, japanese animation and culture, manga and comics, victorian fashion and nature, tv series and fairy tales. Nina Who?Nina is a 23-years-old geeky and indolent girl living an unconfortable period: she's just graduated and is currently unemployed, uncertain if pursue the normal life her family want her to or fight her laziness and follow her aspirations: she dreams of becoming a musical theatre actress, because she wants a part in her favourite plays alongside her favourite actors. In fact, she uses to sing in her head.  Nina doesn't get along very well with the real world, so she finds some comfort in her fantasies and her teddy bear. She has a bunch of imaginary friends who are, in some way, the many voices of her counsciosness. What is Nina's geek-self?Childhood, awkwardness, imagination, fear...... those are the main subjects of ""Nina's geek-self"", which is a funny comic strips collection about Nina and her imaginary friends. ... maybe it's time for Nina to face the frightening real world.If you are a daydreamer and a loner, if your mind is always full of worries and you still have the trauma of the secondary school period... if you dislike people but the person you dislike the most is yourself... then you may like this book! [ you can find few of the comic strips in the gallery, if you're curious :) ]Some technical informations.""Nina's geek-self"" is a collection of many nerdy comic strips, all with the same characters and the same subjects. Hopefully, it's going to be the first volume of a series.  NB. I'm going to ask for help to a native speaker for the translation.Dimensions: 17x24 cm Pages: 40, full colorPaper (inner pages): matte paper, density 100-110 gr/m2  Paper (cover): matte paper, density 200-250g gr/m2Binding: Saddle stitch. Why am I asking for your help?
I'm asking for
funds because I'd really like to print the book in two languages,
English and Italian, because in that way I will be able to promote
""Nina's geek-self"" both in my own country and in the
country I'm going to move (UK). 
The funds I get
from this campaign will be used for the printing costs of 200 volumes
(100 in English and 100 in Italian language) as long as a series of
gadgets, which are bookmarks, stickers, postcards and posters. I
decided to keep the money only if I reach the goal. If I don't, your money will be automatically refunded. In the lucky case I reach bigger results than I expected, I will use the extra money for promotion purposes, like
rent an exhibit space at illustration and comics conventions, which
will hopefully help my art to gain some audience and feedback. ""Nina's
geek-self"" book and merchandise will also be promoted on the
web and sold on my Etsy Shop. I'd also like to distribuite the volume on
Amazon as e-book.
If the campaign will be successful the first thing I'm going to do is print ""Nina's geek-self"" bookmarks, stickers, posters and postcards and make them avaiabile on my Etsy Shop. The contributors who chosed to have them as reward will receive the gadgets by August 2015. Printing times for the book itself will probably be a bit longer, but I'll do my best to make them availabile on my Etsy Shop and for the funders as soon as possible, approximately by the end of September 2015! The e-book will be avaiabile by the same date.
Hopefully, as I said before, by the next year I will also be able to promote the book at comic and illustration conventions in Italy and in UK.

<h3>The Fight Continues!</h3>
<p>--</p>
<p><i>All Hayley held in the aftermath of her stinging defeat against the Doctor was a number. With no hesitation, she punches it into the phone booth and makes the call, bringing her face to face with Maxwell, the owner of the FERAL circuit. His curiosity piqued, Maxwell gives Hayley an ID number and an official place amongst the FERALS. With that, the first steps in Hayley's now personal vendetta against Brandt have now been taken, but before then she must first scramble up the ranks and prove she's worthy.</i></p>
<p><i>In her path laid several obstacles, and whilst meeting with Maxwell she is introduced to one of them, the sadistic Tiziano Vespri, a man with similar grudges against Brandt but has no intention of letting the out of towner take that glory from him. Whether Hayley is capable of overcoming Tiziano's legendary ferocity is solely dependent on how she handles her first, and, given the stakes, possibly her last official match against one of the circuits top tier fighters - Casey...</i></p>
<p><i>--</i></p>
<p>Early January I was knee deep in drawing my first comic strip, something that countless friends have urged me to do. Inspired by the gritty style of modern underground fighting movies, it is a story of a drifter named Hayley Rosa, a girl who believes that with her fighting ability she can take anything she wants. When arriving in Alta city on her so far undefeated tour, she is brought crashing to earth by a local doctor and extremely talented martial artist, Brandt. She vows to take him down at his own game by joining the Feral Circuit, the prestigious fighting syndicate he is a part of. With every challenging step she takes, Hayley changes with the realisation that she is small game, making her desperate and dangerous. Eventually the circuit re-shapes her completely, but into what will depend entirely on the decisions she makes not as a fighter, but as a person...</p>

With his impressive Silat expertise, Kaz will be no walk in the park for Hayley, so here's hoping you're as excited to see it as I am to illustrate it!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Bigger Drive = Much Higher Rewards!</h3>
<p>This time around, I'm attempting to get about <b>$6500 </b>in funds. A few reasons include:</p>
<ul><li>Additional merch, including t-shirts, postcards and possibly a music CD with original tracks composed by Kaz Dragon, Darky and more! (TBA)</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/181576/files/20131107033556-Tshirts_examples.jpg?1383824156"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Personal art as collaboration pieces with the utterly talented <a href=""http://www.furaffinity.net/user/neko-maya/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neko-Maya</a> that will be used as perks and as collectable prints (<a href=""http://www.furaffinity.net/view/11490461/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here for examples</a>). Her colouring ability is outstanding, and intensifies my lineart greatly, making them excellent additions to your collection. </li>
<li>All the other bits and bobs, including the postage for perk items and whatnot.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Over-funding!!!</h3>
<p>Considering there may be a possibility of the funding being exceeded, I would like to propose a few distinct and, frankly, absolutely awesome things to happen in the event that certain thresholds are reached...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$7000</b> - If the final overall number goes over $7000, I'll contribute 10% of the final amount to a charity chosen by popular vote (TBA after the deadline has been reached).</li>
<li>
<b>$8000</b> - So you know how <a href=""http://www.furaffinity.net/user/neko-maya/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Neko-Maya</a> is awesome at colouring things in? She is willing to apply her magic to the opening pages of each chapter, making the comic jump from plain awesome to really rather stunning...</li>
<li>
<b>$11000</b> - Complete colour work by <a href=""http://www.furaffinity.net/user/neko-maya/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Neko-Maya</a>, and if subsequent sales go well, maybe have her on board to colour the rest of the books as they are made.</li>
<li>
<b>$13000 </b>- Did you know that I <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHM-Trb69H0&amp;list=PLMse6YTSVbDeO9k68HR-mgUoIwCywUOZq&amp;feature=mh_lolz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">animate as well</a>? Well if the funding amount it doubled, I'll be bringing in a couple of friends to create a small animated movie of Feral! </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>

Even Furry Down Under's guest artist, the stunningly talented Stucat (check the art he did for the convention here) purchased a copy after a quick flick through, which was simply an honour in my eyes.



He even went on to humble me further with this statement - ""Dr Dubs makes some pretty choice art, and even better that he has made a comic so you get to see more of his work in a continuous stream of pages. Feral has an interesting cast of characters from different fighting disciplines and a different reason for smashing one another. The fight scenes are sweet, it has that visceral feeling of someones face being crushed. The only stink thing is that there is only the first issue, and I want to see who's next on the roster!""
With that, I have both confidence and absolute will to bring the next few chapters to the public, and eventually the entire story. I will also be improving upon the first chapter for the full publication that will be made available through Gashu-group.net! The deadline will be May 2014, and will be continuously updated. As well as this, the improved first chapter will be available to view online once completed, so those who have not bought the initial publication will get an idea of the scope and style, as well as get an insight on exactly what Hayley is up against...



Also making an appearance in a fight against Hayley is the taker of the $600 perk from the last campaign, the talented furry musician Kaz Dragon (above on the right, also click here to buy his brilliant album 'windmills'), who performed alongside Foxamoore at Furdu 2013. As well as this, he has agreed to create some awesome tracks for a small promo CD, also featuring another of Furdu's charity concert performers, Darky (above on the left, who will also be making a guest appearance in the comic). With his impressive Silat expertise, Kaz will be no walk in the park for Hayley, so here's hoping you're as excited to see it as I am to illustrate it!


Bigger Drive = Much Higher Rewards!
This time around, I'm attempting to get about $6500 in funds. A few reasons include:
Additional merch, including t-shirts, postcards and possibly a music CD with original tracks composed by Kaz Dragon, Darky and more! (TBA)




Personal art as collaboration pieces with the utterly talented Neko-Maya that will be used as perks and as collectable prints (click here for examples). Her colouring ability is outstanding, and intensifies my lineart greatly, making them excellent additions to your collection. 
All the other bits and bobs, including the postage for perk items and whatnot.



Over-funding!!!
Considering there may be a possibility of the funding being exceeded, I would like to propose a few distinct and, frankly, absolutely awesome things to happen in the event that certain thresholds are reached...


$7000 - If the final overall number goes over $7000, I'll contribute 10% of the final amount to a charity chosen by popular vote (TBA after the deadline has been reached).

$8000 - So you know how Neko-Maya is awesome at colouring things in? She is willing to apply her magic to the opening pages of each chapter, making the comic jump from plain awesome to really rather stunning...

$11000 - Complete colour work by Neko-Maya, and if subsequent sales go well, maybe have her on board to colour the rest of the books as they are made.

$13000 - Did you know that I animate as well? Well if the funding amount it doubled, I'll be bringing in a couple of friends to create a small animated movie of Feral! 



Other Ways You Can Help

Most magazines do well based on how much they sell at retail stores and that sets a limit on the exposure that each artist, actor, author, model, film director,  game designer or business offering a service receives when they purchase an ad in a magazine.  That exposure is also based on the placement of the ad, How much information is included and how well that person is known depicts whether or not readers want to read the article at first glance. So to change this, Monster Magic Magazine intends to give away digital copies  to both horror and comic convention attendees through contests and by distributing the issues to convention owners or vendors. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622503/files/20140603051740-Comic_Con.jpg?1401797860"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p> This will take some time and funding but with your help we can get our magazine out to the more people everyday and give the creators of many types of independent projects the exposure they deserve.

Most magazines do well based on how much they sell at retail stores and that sets a limit on the exposure that each artist, actor, author, model, film director,  game designer or business offering a service receives when they purchase an ad in a magazine.  That exposure is also based on the placement of the ad, How much information is included and how well that person is known depicts whether or not readers want to read the article at first glance. So to change this, Monster Magic Magazine intends to give away digital copies  to both horror and comic convention attendees through contests and by distributing the issues to convention owners or vendors.  This will take some time and funding but with your help we can get our magazine out to the more people everyday and give the creators of many types of independent projects the exposure they deserve. At the same time, the readers will get to read and experience a truly amazing magazine!How the Magazine will be distributed:We will be self publishing our magazine on line until we can capture the attention of a prominent publishing company who we feel will be very interested in the style and theme of our project. The ultimate goal is to have the magazine printed and on magazine stands all over the world.                  In order to complete our goal we need the following :
Email & Social Media Marketing Costs : $2,000-$4,000

Travel Expenses and Hotel Accommodations : $1,500-$3,000

500+ Magazines printed : $1,500 - $2,000

Editor, Publicist, Writers , Graphic Artist & Staff : $7,000 - $10,000

Our over all profit may be small after expenses but the reward of what we can contribute will be doing something large for the fantasy and horror industry and to see the smiles on our supporters faces, that makes it all worth it!!!      What if our goal is not reached?                If our goal is not reached, YOU STILL GET ALL YOUR PERKS!               We will still do our best to produce this amazing magazine                and honor all the perks. In the event that this isn't possible,               we will gladly refund your money.

<p><strong>Hello Indiegogo Friends !</strong></p>
<p>My name is Kaan and I'm a 32 years old illustrator and comic book artist living in France. I've been making art my whole life, making comics and illustrations professionally in different styles (Science Fiction, Fantasy, Cartoon, Superhero,…) for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>I’m working with my beloved one and professional partner Solène, who is colorist.</p>
<p>The world is changing and the way of book publishing too. Crowdfunding is a wonderful concept which allows with freedom, independency and equitability people from all over the world to support the projects they love and to give the possibility to creators to develop the projects they always dreamed to share with others.</p>
<p>After learning the existence of Indiegogo, and with the coming birth of our first child in august which inspire us artistically, we decided to create this artbook project and share it with you. Your generous and enthusiastic contribution can make this dream come true. Additionally, if you allow us to reach this goal, there will be a sequel to <strong>The Book of Drimz</strong> and we have plenty of other comic book and art projects that we would like also to create and share with you on Indiegogo.</p>

<p><strong>The Book of Drimz</strong> will be a 48 pages artbook featuring highly detailed black and white and color illustrations and sketches, all drawn by me and colored by Solene. These artworks will explore a large variety of themes including : <strong>Science Fiction, Heroic Fantasy, Faeries, Gothic, Pin-Up, Western, Mythology, Exotism, Mysticism, Lovecraftian worlds, Pirates, Weird Creatures, Post Apocalypse, Dinosaurs, etc…</strong></p>
<p>A special section, at the end of the book, will feature your personal <strong>Drimz</strong> (this will be explained in more details in the <strong>What you Get ?</strong> section below).</p>

<h3><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>In a Nutshell:<br/></strong></p>
<h2><em><strong><a href=""http://smallbatchcomics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Small Batch Comics</a></strong> is a brand new, nonprofit publishing imprint that will focus solely on releasing the work of first time comic book creators.</em></h2>
<h3>We recoup our printing/distribution costs – the rest of the back-end goes right to the creators. There is no middle-man to slave your wages to &amp; there is no profit margin for us.</h3>
<h3>It’s all about living within our means.</h3>

<h3>Creators maintain 100% ownership of their work.</h3>
<h3>We only release DRM FREE digital content and all releases are protected under Creative Commons licensing</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>From our Press release:</em></strong></p>
<p>A new nonprofit comic book publishing imprint opens its doors to distribute the work of first time creators:</p>
<p>Straight from the ever-expanding comic book proletariat, comes a brand new opportunity for independent comic creators: Small Batch Comics. Created as a home for <em>new</em> comic creators to showcase their work, Small Batch Comics now joins the ongoing movement in the comic culture to help push creator-owned content straight from unknown contemporary artists, into the hands of readers.</p>
<p>“I strongly believe that creator-owned titles are the renaissance the medium desperately needs right now in order to survive and truly evolve,” said Small Batch Comics’ founder, Jonathan Duran. “Now that technology has made interaction, collaboration and world-wide discourse so manageable, we should inevitably expect comic books as a medium to benefit from this instantly accessible pool of people, information and tools.”</p>
<p>It could be said that Small Batch Comics is the first Socialist collective in the medium; a publisher with a political, ethical and communal stake in the medium itself. Originally, with the creation of <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookcollabs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">r/ComicBookCollabs</a>, Small Batch’s main goal was to cultivate a community which focused on creating new comics via an online classified section for first time, burgeoning creators of all stripes. By combining a social networking backbone <em>and</em> more traditional, independent publishing, Small Batch Comics has made it easier than ever for first time creators to jump into the game. 2012 has often been referred to as ‘the year of the creator,’ and Small Batch plans to do their part to see that conjecture become a reality by helping amateur, undiscovered talent publish their work.</p>
<p>Small Batch Comics will offer an outlet for creators which includes a print and digital distribution method with full editorial services, all of which feed into the goal of helping first time creators create. “It has been said time and again; <em>the way you break into comics is by making comics</em><em>,” observes Duran, “The very specific phrasing, of having to ‘break in’, is vile to me; the fact that you have to break in </em><em>to anything means that someone is actively trying to keep you out – art should not work this way. </em>This is an opportunity for independent creative minds to articulate whatever they’d like, without filter; to say things that are volatile, poetic and subversive. By utilizing the resources freely available to us all we will usurp traditional publishing methods and create truly independent comics with authenticity, honesty and conscience - and in turn, take an active part in democratizing the medium and pushing it more into the hands of the masses.”</p>
<p>Small Batch Comics allows creators to retain 100% ownership of their projects and properties. All Small Batch comics will be released under Creative Commons Licenses. <strong>Small Batch Comics is a nonprofit organization</strong> <em>(Business Entity Number: 6642227)</em>.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is to ensure distribution and creator recompense.</p>
<p>We set a goal of $3,000.00 on this campaign. This money will go to the following places:</p>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>To pay for the print costs (and any ancillary costs) associated with creating physical copies of the books.</li>
</ol><ol start=""2"">
<li>To adequately promote and engage in a small-scale marketing campaign for the anthology release to ensure that these first time creators are more widely read.</li>
</ol><ol start=""3"">
<li>The remainder of any funds collected will be evenly distributed to the creators themselves. Since they’re making no money off of this project it’d be real nice to give them some compensation for all their hard work.</li>
</ol><p>You’ll notice the conspicuous absence of a #4 wherein we, the publishers get to stuff our own pockets with your money. That’s because we’re not going to do that. We, the publishers, are making absolutely no money off of this project. Small Batch Comics is a nonprofit Organization (Business Entity Number: 6642227). The money goes right into the project and right to the creators – just like it should be. We do our part out of a belief in an ideology, not because we want to make a few bucks off of the backs of the people putting <em>their</em> backs into the creation of the work itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Whoa, Whoa, Whoa… <em>Ideology</em>? WTF Are You On About?</strong></h3>
<p>That’s right, we’re the dreamers. You see, we believe there is not only a very real economic inequity which currently blights the face of society, but also a creative disparity – meaning that often times, no matter what the medium, there is a high barrier of entry and a walled off garden of silence standing between small, amateur creators and an audience. Of course, there is a valid argument that this is a good thing – and certainly, every page scribbled up by every fourteen year old should not go to press (and it will not, we still vet submissions and selectively choose the best submissions to become real projects, after all) – but in theory, <em>all should be equal</em>. There should be every chance for the first time creator to have the attention of someone willing to do the backend work for them. So that’s where we come in. Our sole focus is on the person trying to get something made for the first time, our attention is focused on the little people. We want to make it as easy as possible for people to create their first comic work. We started what amounts to a classified website in order to help people find collaborators, through <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookcollabs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Reddit.com/r/comicbookcollabs</a> and some of the people working on this first anthology found their dance partners through this venue. It is tools and resources such as these we hope to further cultivate and make freely available to the community at large.</p>
<p>And this is precisely what will set us apart from traditional publishers with huge amounts of capital behind them - we are the 99% comic book label - we make our own way and we can be successful at it if we simply use a bit of elbow grease and admit satisfaction within our means. We have so many tools freely available to use, to see this concept come to life. The open-source, freeware world is our companion and it is an invaluable resource that helps us to create things which will wrest some control away from the monopolizing business model that currently chokes this medium of autonomy. Just as the music industry imploded under the excess of its own obscene waste and overindulgence, we too can help build a new portion of the industry up around us. In music, the capable artists, with interesting things to say, decided to throw caution to the wind and strike out on their own to independently release their material in their own unique ways - it has proven viable and it can be repeated in the world of comics - Tenacity and passion should <em>not </em>be discounted and can give emotionless, out of touch avarice a run for its life any old day of the week as far as we’re concerned.</p>

<h3><strong>The End Game</strong></h3>
<p>What does it all mean? Well, simply put, this project is all about making it easier for people like you (unless you’re a famous comic creator already) to get their work out there in the wild, albeit on a smaller scale. This is the minor leagues, where people can cut their teeth, learn more about the process of creating a comic book and hopefully, meet and collaborate with some amazing people who they can form long-term bonds with and continue to collaborate with on grander things.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>I’m Broke – What Else Can I Do to Help?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt='panel detail from ""Engine Whispers""' class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://smallbatchcomics.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ew-page-sketch-2-crop-for-text.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title='panel detail from ""Engine Whispers""'/></strong></p>
<p>Well, first off, we’re sorry you’re broke… just remember some of the greatest artists throughout history died in extreme poverty… that’s not necessarily supposed to make you feel better, it’s just supposed to remind you that one day you will die and your pain will be over.</p>
<p>Kidding (sort of)!</p>
<p>If you want to help in a non-monetary fashion, then please, <strong>SPREAD THE WORD</strong>. Post about us, interview us (press@smallbatchcomics.com), tweet, blog and harangue anyone you can so that by the end of this campaign everyone is aware of this tiny speck on their glasses that’s starting to obscure their vision. <em>This is how things begin</em>, in small, subtle ways; the spreading of information. We sincerely hope that the community wil not only take an active part in spreading the words and concepts above, but also, <em>believe they have value</em> – by resisting the cynical urge to scoff and instead thoughtfully embrace any sort of peaceful insurrection and corporate disobedience.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>BUT ALSO - you know the best way you could help us out?</h3>
<h3>By <a href=""http://smallbatchcomics.com/submissions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">submitting</a> a pitch to us! By giving us some great content to publish!</h3>

In a Nutshell:
Small Batch Comics is a brand new, nonprofit publishing imprint that will focus solely on releasing the work of first time comic book creators.
We recoup our printing/distribution costs – the rest of the back-end goes right to the creators. There is no middle-man to slave your wages to & there is no profit margin for us.
It’s all about living within our means.
It’s all about helping creators, create.
Creators maintain 100% ownership of their work.
We only release DRM FREE digital content and all releases are protected under Creative Commons licensing
 
From our Press release:
A new nonprofit comic book publishing imprint opens its doors to distribute the work of first time creators:
Straight from the ever-expanding comic book proletariat, comes a brand new opportunity for independent comic creators: Small Batch Comics. Created as a home for new comic creators to showcase their work, Small Batch Comics now joins the ongoing movement in the comic culture to help push creator-owned content straight from unknown contemporary artists, into the hands of readers.
“I strongly believe that creator-owned titles are the renaissance the medium desperately needs right now in order to survive and truly evolve,” said Small Batch Comics’ founder, Jonathan Duran. “Now that technology has made interaction, collaboration and world-wide discourse so manageable, we should inevitably expect comic books as a medium to benefit from this instantly accessible pool of people, information and tools.”
It could be said that Small Batch Comics is the first Socialist collective in the medium; a publisher with a political, ethical and communal stake in the medium itself. Originally, with the creation of r/ComicBookCollabs, Small Batch’s main goal was to cultivate a community which focused on creating new comics via an online classified section for first time, burgeoning creators of all stripes. By combining a social networking backbone and more traditional, independent publishing, Small Batch Comics has made it easier than ever for first time creators to jump into the game. 2012 has often been referred to as ‘the year of the creator,’ and Small Batch plans to do their part to see that conjecture become a reality by helping amateur, undiscovered talent publish their work.
Small Batch Comics will offer an outlet for creators which includes a print and digital distribution method with full editorial services, all of which feed into the goal of helping first time creators create. “It has been said time and again; the way you break into comics is by making comics,” observes Duran, “The very specific phrasing, of having to ‘break in’, is vile to me; the fact that you have to break in to anything means that someone is actively trying to keep you out – art should not work this way. This is an opportunity for independent creative minds to articulate whatever they’d like, without filter; to say things that are volatile, poetic and subversive. By utilizing the resources freely available to us all we will usurp traditional publishing methods and create truly independent comics with authenticity, honesty and conscience - and in turn, take an active part in democratizing the medium and pushing it more into the hands of the masses.”
Small Batch Comics allows creators to retain 100% ownership of their projects and properties. All Small Batch comics will be released under Creative Commons Licenses. Small Batch Comics is a nonprofit organization (Business Entity Number: 6642227).
 
What We Need & What You Get
This Indiegogo campaign is to ensure distribution and creator recompense.
We set a goal of $3,000.00 on this campaign. This money will go to the following places:

To pay for the print costs (and any ancillary costs) associated with creating physical copies of the books.

To adequately promote and engage in a small-scale marketing campaign for the anthology release to ensure that these first time creators are more widely read.

The remainder of any funds collected will be evenly distributed to the creators themselves. Since they’re making no money off of this project it’d be real nice to give them some compensation for all their hard work.
You’ll notice the conspicuous absence of a #4 wherein we, the publishers get to stuff our own pockets with your money. That’s because we’re not going to do that. We, the publishers, are making absolutely no money off of this project. Small Batch Comics is a nonprofit Organization (Business Entity Number: 6642227). The money goes right into the project and right to the creators – just like it should be. We do our part out of a belief in an ideology, not because we want to make a few bucks off of the backs of the people putting their backs into the creation of the work itself.
 
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa… Ideology? WTF Are You On About?
That’s right, we’re the dreamers. You see, we believe there is not only a very real economic inequity which currently blights the face of society, but also a creative disparity – meaning that often times, no matter what the medium, there is a high barrier of entry and a walled off garden of silence standing between small, amateur creators and an audience. Of course, there is a valid argument that this is a good thing – and certainly, every page scribbled up by every fourteen year old should not go to press (and it will not, we still vet submissions and selectively choose the best submissions to become real projects, after all) – but in theory, all should be equal.

In music, the capable artists, with interesting things to say, decided to throw caution to the wind and strike out on their own to independently release their material in their own unique ways - it has proven viable and it can be repeated in the world of comics - Tenacity and passion should not be discounted and can give emotionless, out of touch avarice a run for its life any old day of the week as far as we’re concerned.

The End Game
What does it all mean? Well, simply put, this project is all about making it easier for people like you (unless you’re a famous comic creator already) to get their work out there in the wild, albeit on a smaller scale. This is the minor leagues, where people can cut their teeth, learn more about the process of creating a comic book and hopefully, meet and collaborate with some amazing people who they can form long-term bonds with and continue to collaborate with on grander things.
 
I’m Broke – What Else Can I Do to Help?

Well, first off, we’re sorry you’re broke… just remember some of the greatest artists throughout history died in extreme poverty… that’s not necessarily supposed to make you feel better, it’s just supposed to remind you that one day you will die and your pain will be over.
Kidding (sort of)!
If you want to help in a non-monetary fashion, then please, SPREAD THE WORD. Post about us, interview us (press@smallbatchcomics.com), tweet, blog and harangue anyone you can so that by the end of this campaign everyone is aware of this tiny speck on their glasses that’s starting to obscure their vision. This is how things begin, in small, subtle ways; the spreading of information. We sincerely hope that the community wil not only take an active part in spreading the words and concepts above, but also, believe they have value – by resisting the cynical urge to scoff and instead thoughtfully embrace any sort of peaceful insurrection and corporate disobedience.
 
BUT ALSO - you know the best way you could help us out?
By submitting a pitch to us! By giving us some great content to publish!
Seriously - we still have room for content in the first Anthology release! The best way to help us is by making good work and allowing us to publish it for you  - the better work we release the more help we've just received!
We love all genres and styles - send us your projects and become an integral part of this campaign's success for free!
 
 
 Thank you all! Let’s make some comics!

<p>I’ve always loved and laughed watching those great Johnny Carson and David Letterman cooking segments and that’s where the inspiration began .</p>
<p><b>Comedy Menu</b> blends comedy and cuisine together into a truly original series where, in the end, top-name comics must eat their own work and respected chefs must suffer fools - all near an open flame. Simple. Delicious. Hilarious.</p>
<p>I’m excited and driven to offer up 7 fully-produced episodes featuring top comic guest-stars. The budget considers the cost of everything from sauté pans to paying the talent and crew. My background in comedy is extensive and my 40 plus years' experience in and knowledge of producing a live show has well prepared me for Comedy Menu. I know a lot of famous comics who would love to get in the kitchen with the brilliant comic Kira Soltanovich (who wouldn’t?) and cook up something funny for us! I’m so excited about this very commercial, fresh, funny idea!</p>
<p>Wouldn’t you love to see Sarah Silverman or Louie CK attempting to prepare Haggis Tartar on The Food Network or Comedy Central? People tell me, “Yes!”</p>
