A Small Way to Fix Our Big Broken System


Health Coaches do really important work and empowering them is what CTC is all about! We are emerging as a powerful new practitioner in the healthcare system. 


With lifestyle choices emerging as the primary causes of chronic disease and death, preventative healthcare and mobile healthcare are changing the way disease prevention is understood and practiced


There are big shifts happening in healthcare, including patient-centered care and value-based healthcare

Our ""healthcare"" system is in crisis! Despite Americans spending almost $10K/year PER PERSON, the U.S. still has lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality than most high-income countries, and unpaid medical bills are the #1 cause of bankruptcy 

“It’s an allusion that medicine is prevention--it’s intervention. Prevention is people taking care themselves.”



The Market

The coaching industry is growing FAST $2.356 billion  in 2015, up 19% since 2011
Mobile apps account for 90% off all mobile usage
Health Tech is getting a LOT of attention from traditional VC's




 The Founder (Me)



My private coaching practice is Zone Nutrition Inc, which is a powerful, proprietary and unique method of mindful eating, personalized nutrition, behavior design, and social support

My most trusted nutrition inspirations are Dr. John Berardi (I'm a Precision Nutrition devotee), Andrea Nakayama, and the folks at Authority Nutrition


I am in a unique position to make this project successful: I'm a health coach so I know how you think/what you want/where [we] hang out online, I'm a total ""app-addict"" so I know what makes a great user experience, I've tried everything on the market and I've put together only the best features for CTC

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>ShakeSphere V2 has a round lid and a round base therefore none of your supplements can get stuck in the corners because there are no corners. Due to the unique capsule shape you do not require a mixing ball or a grid in order to achieve superior mixing. The liquid and powder travels in a circular motion therefore allows you to have a frothy shake every time.</p>

ShakeSphere V2 has a round lid and a round base therefore none of your supplements can get stuck in the corners because there are no corners. Due to the unique capsule shape you do not require a mixing ball or a grid in order to achieve superior mixing. The liquid and powder travels in a circular motion therefore allows you to have a frothy shake every time.

<p>At present the dieting industry is a multi-billion-pound industry worth in excess of £100,000,000,000 (100 billion pounds), with the two big dieting giants worth over £3bn combined. We are looking to replace their market share with The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan in the next 10 years. Investing in 80/20 today will allow you to receive a slice of these profits in the near future.</p>
</div><p>At present we have spent a year in test phase, during which over 500 women and 30 men have trialled 80/20. Our success rate is over 87% in sustained weight loss over a 6-month period, with a 100% success rate in achieving our completed members’ initial goals of seeing progress mentally and physically.</p><p><strong>These statistics are unheard-of</strong> in the world of weight loss, and we are so proud of what our members have achieved.</p><p>We are looking to launch 80/20 to the public in January 2018, and have already secured national press coverage for the end of 2017 to ramp us into a good launch for January.</p><p>We have a solid team of 12 professionals working behind the scenes, including myself, Nicky Chapman (psychotherapist), Hannah Sweetman (Head of Nutrition), sports scientists and a business director with 20 years’ experience in the leisure and fitness industry. We have the brawn and the brain power, resource and social footing… we just need a leg-up with finances to secure more marketing, an even stronger team and media creation.</p><p>We are offering company shares when purchasing some of the perks to the side. You will not only become a member of The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan when purchasing one of the perks, but you will also receive the listed company shares as an investment too.</p><p>Some of these funds will go towards opening a female-only gym facility and operating base for 80/20 in Surrey, which will provide a supported community to empower and educate women.</p><p>Any remaining funds will be used to grow the team of experts, to market 80/20 globally through PR, to conduct online and offline marketing, and to start the offline model of a national franchise here in the UK.</p><p>The funds for marketing are going to be crucial to the exposure and member sign-ups. One of the key challenges is convincing someone who has dieted for many years that there is a new and sustainable way to achieve their goals. It’s not only a new way, but something that seems fantastical before you are familiar with the science of how The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan works. This has been our biggest challenge by far, so the marketing efforts needed to get this message across need to be creative and convincing, backed up by real success and real people.</p><p>We want to give back to those who helped us at the start, and we would love for you to share in our passion to annihilate dieting misery for everyone, forever.</p><p>5% of the director shares will be split into shares for you, the investor. Depending on your level of support to the campaign, your shares will vary from non-director shares to full director shares and a voice on the board.</p><p> </p><p>If we are unable to meet our total target, then we have prioritised the 80/20 gym and the growth of PR and marketing. This will still allow us to leap a lot further forward than where we currently are.</p><h3>What else do we do here at 80/20?</h3><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/237577744?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><h3>For investors</h3><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/237577607?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h2><strong>The Background of our WHY</strong></h2><p>Back in 2009 I was working for a large corporate business managing their European online marketing, and had just come out of a long-term relationship. I was obese, lazy and disgusted with what I had become. I was miserable.</p><p>I set off on a path that led to losing <strong><u>eight stone,</u></strong> and eventually became a fitness professional and achieved my personal goals of becoming a front-cover fitness model – an ambition that proved short-lived. I quickly realised how much I loved helping other people through their journeys, and quit that very well-paid corporate gig to set up my own business… my new life passion: to change people’s lives.</p><p>Fast forward 7 years, having kept the weight off, I started to analyse why some people found it so hard to lose weight compared to others. For me personally, it was a monumental struggle. Day in, day out, I battled through emotional eating, bingeing, being motivated and then demotivated  again. Some days it was hard just to get out of bed.</p><p>However, at the same time I saw people in my office who seemed to lose weight quickly – albeit they often put it back on just as fast.</p><p>What was the key to sustained, long-term weight loss, without the relapse?</p><p>In 2016 I was filmed for Channel 4s documentary <i>Super Slimmers: Did They Really Keep the Weight Off?. </i>This was a defining moment for me, which ultimately led me to develop and launch The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan.</p><p>The documentary followed five amazing people who lost a significant amount of weight, but unfortunately piled all the weight back on shortly after.</p><p>I was pitched as the fat-loss expert who had managed to not only lose weight, but keep it off for well over six years. How?</p><ul>
<li>What made me different from the millions of people who lose weight only to put it all back on?</li>
<li>Was it genetics?</li>
<li>Was it an obsession with training and exercise?</li>
</ul><p>These questions ran through my mind at the time of filming, and the answers led to the cornerstones of The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan:</p><ul>
<li>Education!</li>
<li>Moderation!</li>
<li>Mindset!</li>
</ul><p>Later that year, my team set to work developing a solution to the dieting industry.</p><p>It’s obvious to everyone that diets don’t work. If they did, we would only do them once and the weight would never come back. This isn’t the case for 90% of people.</p><p>The big giants in this field ‘boast’ a 40% success rate – meaning that 60% of their members put the weight back on within a year and 60% of THOSE members put more weight back on than they started with. And they blame themselves for their ‘failure’.</p><p>This is what I want to change. I want to stop this misery, and I passionately believe that The 80/20 Lifestyle Project is the answer.</p><p>Late in 2016 I met an amazing woman called Nicky Chapman (psychotherapist by day, mindset legend by night), who co-founded and co-presents 80/20 with me. We set to work creating the fundamental USP of 80/20…</p><h2>So what do you learn on 80/20?</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507625848/lghy95hllgpt7rqvucno.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>*This image shows the 12-week educational program that we present in the test groups.

You will not only become a member of The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan when purchasing one of the perks, but you will also receive the listed company shares as an investment too.Some of these funds will go towards opening a female-only gym facility and operating base for 80/20 in Surrey, which will provide a supported community to empower and educate women.Any remaining funds will be used to grow the team of experts, to market 80/20 globally through PR, to conduct online and offline marketing, and to start the offline model of a national franchise here in the UK.The funds for marketing are going to be crucial to the exposure and member sign-ups. One of the key challenges is convincing someone who has dieted for many years that there is a new and sustainable way to achieve their goals. It’s not only a new way, but something that seems fantastical before you are familiar with the science of how The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan works. This has been our biggest challenge by far, so the marketing efforts needed to get this message across need to be creative and convincing, backed up by real success and real people.We want to give back to those who helped us at the start, and we would love for you to share in our passion to annihilate dieting misery for everyone, forever.5% of the director shares will be split into shares for you, the investor. Depending on your level of support to the campaign, your shares will vary from non-director shares to full director shares and a voice on the board. If we are unable to meet our total target, then we have prioritised the 80/20 gym and the growth of PR and marketing. This will still allow us to leap a lot further forward than where we currently are.What else do we do here at 80/20?For investors The Background of our WHYBack in 2009 I was working for a large corporate business managing their European online marketing, and had just come out of a long-term relationship. I was obese, lazy and disgusted with what I had become. I was miserable.I set off on a path that led to losing eight stone, and eventually became a fitness professional and achieved my personal goals of becoming a front-cover fitness model – an ambition that proved short-lived. I quickly realised how much I loved helping other people through their journeys, and quit that very well-paid corporate gig to set up my own business… my new life passion: to change people’s lives.Fast forward 7 years, having kept the weight off, I started to analyse why some people found it so hard to lose weight compared to others. For me personally, it was a monumental struggle. Day in, day out, I battled through emotional eating, bingeing, being motivated and then demotivated  again. Some days it was hard just to get out of bed.However, at the same time I saw people in my office who seemed to lose weight quickly – albeit they often put it back on just as fast.What was the key to sustained, long-term weight loss, without the relapse?In 2016 I was filmed for Channel 4s documentary Super Slimmers: Did They Really Keep the Weight Off?. This was a defining moment for me, which ultimately led me to develop and launch The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan.The documentary followed five amazing people who lost a significant amount of weight, but unfortunately piled all the weight back on shortly after.I was pitched as the fat-loss expert who had managed to not only lose weight, but keep it off for well over six years. How?
What made me different from the millions of people who lose weight only to put it all back on?
Was it genetics?
Was it an obsession with training and exercise?
These questions ran through my mind at the time of filming, and the answers led to the cornerstones of The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan:
Education!
Moderation!
Mindset!
Later that year, my team set to work developing a solution to the dieting industry.It’s obvious to everyone that diets don’t work. If they did, we would only do them once and the weight would never come back. This isn’t the case for 90% of people.The big giants in this field ‘boast’ a 40% success rate – meaning that 60% of their members put the weight back on within a year and 60% of THOSE members put more weight back on than they started with. And they blame themselves for their ‘failure’.This is what I want to change. I want to stop this misery, and I passionately believe that The 80/20 Lifestyle Project is the answer.Late in 2016 I met an amazing woman called Nicky Chapman (psychotherapist by day, mindset legend by night), who co-founded and co-presents 80/20 with me. We set to work creating the fundamental USP of 80/20…So what do you learn on 80/20?*This image shows the 12-week educational program that we present in the test groups. In January, this same content will be spread over 16 weeks due to the feedback we've had from the test members.Other Ways You Can HelpYou may not be in a position to financially invest or purchase a membership to The 80/20 Lifestyle Plan, and that’s OK.

</div><p>Hi there, </p>
<p><b>The story so far</b></p>
<p>We are
three sisters and a brother. We have been raised by two parents that have
taught us that love is the most important thing in the world which has kept us
bonded. For two years we have all worked together at a café called Thinking (C)up.
We have worked there since it opened and helped to build it from the very
start. We decorated the entire space and helped to choose suppliers and
constructed a concept for the store. Even though the shop belongs to a very
dear friend of ours we feel very connected to it and love spending time there.
The café is situated near one of the biggest universities in Athens so we serve
coffee to thousands of students every day. It has become a hang out and a place
to meet, study, laugh and play. We have got to know a lot of them personally
and our jobs now feel like a hobby. We are sociable and friendly and all the
love we have shown has been reciprocated.<br/><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Our lovely students!!</p><span><i>(Photos of the Thinking (C)up, the one that already exists)</i></span><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441794215/ypz771st4o1dgnbjkpmt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>The opportunity</b></p>
<p>We enjoy
every day and now we have the opportunity to create a similar space for
ourselves. There is a new section of campus being built nearby and we feel like
it would be the best chance to provide for the extra students that be filling
the university. Our friend who owns the café has suggested that we expand the
business and give Thinking (C)up a baby brother down the road. Of course we
will continue to support him in every way and pull shifts whenever required. We
think the two shops will complement each other beautifully. We’re super
excited!! <br/><br/></p><p>Hi, thank you all!!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441794257/mefa9gedfjhozsarbzaf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

providing many happy faces with good service and a warm cup of coffee. The
space we have found is going to be small and cozy to get us started. Since it
will be a student meeting place we envision that it will have a mini library
for study, a dining table for group discussion and board games for winding
down. We will plan student events like welcome week, comedy nights, chess
tournaments, quiz nights and Christmas parties. We want to get to know more
students and help them to fit in and feel welcome – we think we can provide a

<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>To achieve
all of this we need a little bit of help. Even though we have all worked for
two years and pooled our savings together our total budget is a little  below what we need. We have bought the

first buy the wood and paint. We’re going to use energy efficient LED bulbs for
lighting above the bar. The next steps are buying the supplies. We start with
tables and chairs then choose cups and cutlery. We’ll need a few extra because
being in Greece some will be placed outside in the sunshine for al fresco

<br/><h3>How It's Different</h3> <p>Compared to Smoothie Shops, QuenchBot™ has:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% fresh ingredients. Many smoothie shops use concentrates as some ingredients.</li>
<li>The potential to be access anytime. Smoothie shops have fixed hours.</li>
<li>The ability to be installed in many locations that don't have space for a shop</li>
<li>A fully customizable menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to other Smoothie Machines, QuenchBot™ has:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Transparent panel to see the ingredients and their freshness</li>
<li>Ability to build your own drink</li>
<li>Lots of variety</li>

</div></div>","Meet QuenchBot™. A patent pending robotic machine that contains fresh fruits and vegetables to build you a refreshing smoothie on-demand! We have started building a prototype with a local manufacturer, engineers and vending machine distributor (look under Partners). We're looking to raise funds to complete our prototype!











  
How It Works


Walk upto a machine and choose the drink you want from a digital menu.

Customize (add, remove, increase, decrease) your ingredients.
Pay with your credit card.
The Smoothie Robot will collect all the ingredients in a cup, blend it and hand it to you!


How It's Different Compared to Smoothie Shops, QuenchBot™ has:

100% fresh ingredients. Many smoothie shops use concentrates as some ingredients.
The potential to be access anytime. Smoothie shops have fixed hours.
The ability to be installed in many locations that don't have space for a shop
A fully customizable menu.

Compared to other Smoothie Machines, QuenchBot™ has:


Transparent panel to see the ingredients and their freshness
Ability to build your own drink
Lots of variety

Compared to Bottled Drinks, QuenchBot™:

Uses fresh fruits and ingredients
Creates a drink on-demand on-the-spot



QuenchBot Locations

Imagine a smoothie shop in a box. If you have space to install and manage a large vending machine, QuenchBot™ is yours! Businesses who can benefit from the machine are the ones looking to:  Expand their drinks options
Add healthy palatable choices
Adopt new technology and automation
Reduce maintenance and other costs (self-serve)

Ideal Locations to install QuenchBot™:
 School cafeteria

Corporate kitchens
Gym
Grocery stores
Coffee shops, Cafes, Restaurants
Transit centers
Malls

In about 15 minutes most of the freshness and fizz has already been lost! It’s almost impossible to keep your canned drink fresh and fizzy for long. Not only that, but opening canned drinks can be difficult and damaging to fingernails and your fingernail polish. That’s only the beginning. Once that can has been opened, the drink quickly goes flat and pests like bees, flies, ants and other insects are attracted to the canned drink and become a nuisance, or worse still a danger to those allergic to Bees and Wasps and gets stung within the Throat.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">"" If we could  just save 1 Life, a Child Allergic to Bee or Wasp Stings...It would be All Worth It ""</span><br/></p><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDOv-vkQOzA"" width=""640""></iframe></div><p></p><b><a href=""https://youtu.be/rDOv-vkQOzA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USA: Mothers with Young Children - Testimonial of FizzSaver™ A.K.A Co2Saver™ Product Review.

Co2Saver™ By CharlesDesigns® Demostration 4 Simple Steps. Click LinkWelcome everyone, we wanted to make this an Inclusive Crowdfunding Campaign, where we will attempt to include those with special needs, by creating a video for the Write-Up Story itself. You may now choose to listen or watch the Write-Up Story, rather then read about us, it's for your convenience especially for those who really need it.CharlesDesigns® Indiegogo Spokesperson for the FizzSaver™. Click LinkWe all love our fizzy drinks, but once you open that can, the clock starts ticking down to a flat, boring, life-less drink. In about 15 minutes most of the freshness and fizz has already been lost! It’s almost impossible to keep your canned drink fresh and fizzy for long. Not only that, but opening canned drinks can be difficult and damaging to fingernails and your fingernail polish. That’s only the beginning. Once that can has been opened, the drink quickly goes flat and pests like bees, flies, ants and other insects are attracted to the canned drink and become a nuisance, or worse still a danger to those allergic to Bees and Wasps and gets stung within the Throat."" If we could  just save 1 Life, a Child Allergic to Bee or Wasp Stings...It would be All Worth It ""USA: Mothers with Young Children - Testimonial of FizzSaver™ A.K.A Co2Saver™ Product Review. Click LinkThe FizzSaver’s innovative design focuses on 3 key benefits;
The Seal, which preserves the fizzy freshness for over an amazing 7 hours.
The Opener, which makes it easy to open your favorite drink and protects fingernails and nail polish.
The Cover which prevents pests like bees, flies, and ants from crawling on the rim, where your mouth touches, or entering the can.The cover also prevents messy spills.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Ian Garside, the inventor of the Sciatic Pain Relief Cushion, understands the debilitating nature of this pain as it is something he himself has suffered with.  </p>
<p>One day he realised that whilst he was seated and the sciatic nerve that was causing him pain was not under pressure it was the most comfortable that he had been.  This lead to Ian developing the concept for the cushion.</p>
<p>When the cushion worked for Ian he became passionate to see it help as many people as possible so that they too could find some relief.  This lead to him setting up a business with Mark Dunwell and Jo Milnes.  Mark is also a Remedial Massage Therapist and has had a long career as a successful operations manager in various manufacturing industries.  Jo has a technical background and many years experience in medical device development and construction.  </p>
<h3>The Product</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494002987/u1dw6ikws9jjbhlmxm33.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>After extensive development and testing we have created a cushion that not only works, with 93% of those that have trialled the cushion reporting a reduction in pain, but is also portable and discrete.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The heart shape of the cushion is the key.  The cushion is placed on the seat with the gap at the rear on the side where you experience the sciatic pain.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494003250/a8g7mgemeodvtplshyym.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When you are suffering with sciatic pain the sciatic nerve is hypersensitive to any stimulation. Small amounts of stimulation can cause excessive pain. One of the keys to recovering from sciatic pain is to calm the nerve from over stimulation.</p>
<p>Nerves are highly sensitive to the mechanical stimulus of stretch and pressure - both of these stimulae happen when you sit, which is why often sitting is uncomfortable if you have sciatica. Appropriate stretching can be beneficial for sciatica, but stretching while the nerve is under pressure can be painful. The Sciatic Pain Relief Cushion allows gentle stretching of the sciatic nerve whilst sitting without the pressure. This can be seen from the pressure mapping results below:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494771706/size46wwdvpntwknmypb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>The first sciatic pain sufferers to try the cushion saw the benefit  and as more try the cushion the feedback is just as strong, if not stronger.  No product will work for everyone but we are delighted that the cushion is helping such a large percentage of those suffering from sciatic pain.  Those that have tried it whilst pregnant have also found it beneficial in improving their comfort when seated.</p>

aches and pains can be alleviated in no small part by better fitness. In many
cases, in East-Central Indiana, I find that there’s intention, but no

many of those that need the fitness the most only need a small incentive to
begin or continue their path to a healthier lifestyle. <span> </span>In East-Central Indiana, there is a dearth of

event tailored to them. <span> </span>Rather, there
are triathlons, soccer clubs, tennis clubs, 5K and 10K runs, mini-marathons,
bicycle races. <span> </span>All of these worthwhile

contributions, fills a gap that is applicable to most of the population in the
area. <span> </span>By bringing in world class dance
fitness instructors, it builds the interest and can give hope, incentive, or
motivation to those who cannot participate in highly regimented training, to
participate in an event that is fun that raises the heartrate, and feels like
one is just dancing. <span> </span>Your contribution
will allow 400 people that absolutely need encouragement, need motivation, and
need positive feedback to discover that the local dance fitness instructors and
the world class dance fitness instructors share the same enthusiasm for

I am Juan Toro, purveyor of Don Juan Fitness,
a licensed Zumba(r) Instructor, Soccer Official, and disabled combat Veteran.  Muncie Fit-Con is
my idea to establish an annual dance fitness event in Muncie, Indiana, in conjunction
with the municipal leadership that will be a celebration of cardio fitness and
dance.
Muncie Fit-Con will happen on 16 JULY 2016 at Cornerstone for the Arts, Muncie, Indiana, from 2:30 pm to 6pm.  Ticket sales to the General Public will begin on 3 APRIL 2016.Proud to announce that International Zumba(r) Fitness Presenters Kass Martin and Steve Boedt will be the special Guest StarsThe inaugural Muncie Fit-Con will be a fun-packed
three hour event of cardio fitness and dance featuring a selection of our
excellent local fitness instructors alongside invited internationally renowned,
world-class fitness instructors for the attending public.  Fitness
instructors vary in methods and techniques; however the student/participant
gains a better outcome when exposed to a full range of fitness instruction.  

We want to put Muncie on the map for fitness
in East Central Indiana. We want to bring national and international fitness

fitness instructors and expose the general public to the benefits of cardio

What We Want - What You Get
Fitness Instructors have amazing talent
and dedication; though at $5/student, most fitness instructors are happy to

truly professional settings.  Many potential fitness students rarely have

instructors support the local community while maintaining busy home and
professional lives and teaching their dedicated students.  Therefore, Muncie Fit-Con serves East-Central
Indiana fitness needs by providing a world class venue, with world class
instructors, and a world class supportive environment.
Your contributions will go towards the very mundane, yet very important tasks of reserving the venue,
renting the stage, curtains, and piping, renting the lighting, and placing

 Additionally, your generous contributions will allow the initial block of
tickets to be purchased and provided to the Boys and Girls Club of Muncie.

Chronic pain is epidemic in our society, affecting around 100 million Americans; more than Type II Diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined.* <br/>It’s a significant public health problem that costs the US up to $635 billion annually – approximately $2000 per capita – in health care costs and lost productivity.**<br/>These numbers continue to grow, but what many people don’t know is that <b><i>chronic pain doesn’t have to be a life sentence</i></b>.  <br/><br/>Hi, I’m Jennifer Soames. I’ve been a Licensed Massage Practitioner (LMP) for nearly a decade, and a Board Certified Structural Integrator (BCSI) since 2011. I specialize in offering my clients solutions for chronic pain through therapeutic, hands-on bodywork and movement education.  <br/><br/>Most of the clients who come to me have tried about everything under the sun to help free themselves of chronic pain: massage, physical therapy, chiropractic care, pain medication, surgery, etc. Though clients have experienced some help from the aforementioned modalities, they've had limited success and are not willing to settle for a decreased quality of life saddled with chronic pain. People need solutions, not a temporary bandage.  <br/><br/>Using a combination of Structural Integration bodywork (a very specialized form of massage) and yoga, I help individuals release years of tension and pain, restoring their body’s natural function and range of motion. This method is called RolfYoga.  <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453772950/giwzgshxiggmsxqqkvvh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>RolfYoga is a drug-free, non-invasive approach that gives individuals a chance to finally live pain-free, and help them reclaim the joy and quality of life they've been missing for many years.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of local climbers dedicated to establishing a place for the Brattleboro climbing community to come together. Our 30+ years of combined climbing experience have brought us sport climbing in the Red River Gorge, trad climbing in the White Mountains in New Hampshire, bouldering in Western Massachusetts and deep water soloing in Mallorca.</p>
<p>Climbing is an incredible sport which goes hand in hand with an active lifestyle and love of the outdoors. Climbing gyms are a resource for the community. They offer a safe, inclusive environment for new climbers to get involved with the sport and a training ground for experienced climbers to hone their skills.</p>
<p>The Southern Vermont community has spoken! The response to this project both online and in person has been overwhelmingly positive. We are confident that the community is here to support the BrattCave Bouldering Gym!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The materials we need include lumber, holds and mats. The climbing walls will be made of plywood supported by wooden planks. To protect climbers when they fall, we need foam mats. We will also have to pay for rent and insurance. Here is a list of our needs and their estimated costs.</p>
<p>Lumber: $3,000</p>
<p>Holds: $3,000</p>
<p>Mats: $5,000</p>
<p>Rent and Insurance: $2,000</p>
<p>Other Expenses: $2,000</p>
<p>We will be offering perks including bumper stickers, t-shirts and advance memberships in our gym to people who contribute to our campaign! </p>
<p>If we do not reach our fundraising goal, we will continue the project anyway! The money will be spent on lumber and construction of the facility.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you are helping us create another great resource for the Brattleboro community. BrattCave will be a reason for people to come to Brattleboro and another great way for local people to stay active.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<h1>What is Smoke Ghost?</h1>
<p></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Simply put, Smoke Ghost masks the odor of the smoke you exhale with aromatic fragrances. This essentially means that you can smoke anywhere in the world without leaving a trace. Here is a short summary of all the benefits and features the little Ghost provides:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Prevents second-hand smoke</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Saves environment from polluting and carcinogenic toxins</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Contains interchangeable scent cartridges</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Masks odor of smoke completely, can be used indoors and in vehicles</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Portable, under 3 inches long and under 2 inches thick</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Now let's delve deeper into the Ghost's power.</span></p>
<h1>Components/Specifications</h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You may have seen similar smoking filters that attempt to deal with the smell of smoke. Smoke Ghost is distinct in that it not only filters your smoke but it alters the scent of your smoke into essential oil fragrances. The oil fragrances not only smell delightful, they combat the smell of the burning end of the substance you're smoking in order to fully mask the smell.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The nozzle component of the Ghost contains a carbon filter that cleanses the smoke as you blow through. The nozzle is wide enough at the base (about 1.5 inches) to encapsulate your lips as the smoke leaves your mouth. This means that <i>all</i> of the smoke passes through the nozzle. Here's a pic of the nozzle.</span></p>
<p></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The first component of the device is the nozzle, the second component is the scent cartridge, the magical part. The scent cartridge contains an essential oils compound that radically transforms the odor of your smoke. This stuff smells sweet. For our current prototype models, we have three scents; lavender, jasmine, and ocean waves. We plan to add three more scents to this collection for a total of 6 possible scents. Here's a pic of the current scent cartridge prototypes we have:</span></p>

<h1>Interchangeable Scents</h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">One of the most awesome features of these scent cartridges is that they're interchangeable. Every scent cartridge is compatible with the filter. Typically, a scent cartridge is 100% efficient in altering smoke odor for around 300 blow throughs (this is for our current prototype, we expect to increase this number once the first PO is placed). After this point, the cartridge gradually declines in efficacy.  So once one scent cartridge begins to decline in potency, you can simply replace it with another. This adds even more life to your Ghost.</span></p>
<h1>Prevents Second-Hand Smoke</h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), since 1964, approximately 2,500,000 nonsmokers have died from health problems caused by exposure to secondhand smoke. In children, secondhand smoke causes the following: ear infections, more frequent and severe asthma attacks, respiratory symptoms and infections (bronchitis and pneumonia), and a greater risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Obviously smoking is associated with these types of risks. One of our goals is to mitigate such negative externalities with Smoke Ghost. Exhaling the smoke through the Ghost filters the toxins and carcinogens in the smoke so others you are smoking around do not feel its harmful effects.</span></p>
<h1>Save the Trees!</h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In addition to saving people from the harmful effects of smoke, Smoke Ghost saves the environment from the harmful effects of smoke. According to WebMD, the smoke from ""three cigarettes can cause more air pollution than a diesel car's exhaust"" (Hitti, 2004). Environmental tobacco smoke is a major source of particulate matter pollution. This air pollution is associated with numerous respiratory problems and lung diseases.  A single cigarette smoked indoors causes toxin concentrations ""that are often higher than the federal air quality standards designed to protect public health in ambient air outdoors"" (<a href=""http://exposurescience.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">exposurescience.org</a>). With Smoke Ghost, however, you can smoke your cigarettes without polluting your home and community's air. The Ghost allows you to smoke in your home without producing these dangerously high toxin concentrations.</span></p>

<h1>Smoke Discretely</h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As you've learned from the earlier portion of this description, when you use Smoke Ghost to smoke all the odors associated with the smoke vanish and return as savory scents. This allows you to smoke anywhere without the scent of the smoke disturbing others.

Indeed, the filter and the essential oils work together to eliminate such odors.</span></p>

My name is Tricia Montgomery and I won my battle with obesity. Not long ago, I was overweight, run down, and in dire need of change. One day, I took my dog, Louie, on a routine visit to the vet. Little did I know how much my life would change that day. My caring yet frank veterinarian told me that both Louie and I were grossly overweight, that our lives were in jeopardy, and that we needed to change - immediately. When I realized that I had passed my unhealthy habits on to my dear dog, I had an “A-ha” moment and vowed to turn both of our lives around.</p><p>For the first time in my life, I got serious about fitness. Louie and I started shaking our tails every day together and the pounds quickly began to melt away. I realized that something about having my furry friend by my side gave me the confidence and motivation to keep pushing forward even when the going got tough. Fast–forward 130 lbs. later for me, (and 4 lbs. for Louie), and we were both fit and healthy for the first time in a long time! My newfound confidence inspired my new life's mission: to share the joy of health with overweight dog owners and their pets.</p><p>I created <a href=""http://www.k9fitclub.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">K9 Fit Club</a> – the first scientifically-based fitness, health and wellness program of its kind, designed for both owners and their pets! We have successfully licensed this idea in fitness facilities, doggy daycares and veterinary facilities across the US and Canada, and we are now poised to help even more people with our first brick and mortar store in St. Peters, MO.</p><p>Keep reading to learn about our plan, perks you get for donating, accolades we’ve received, how your donation will be used, and testimonials from folks who’ve benefit from our program!</p><p>Better You.

My name is Tricia Montgomery and I won my battle with obesity. Not long ago, I was overweight, run down, and in dire need of change. One day, I took my dog, Louie, on a routine visit to the vet. Little did I know how much my life would change that day. My caring yet frank veterinarian told me that both Louie and I were grossly overweight, that our lives were in jeopardy, and that we needed to change - immediately. When I realized that I had passed my unhealthy habits on to my dear dog, I had an “A-ha” moment and vowed to turn both of our lives around.For the first time in my life, I got serious about fitness. Louie and I started shaking our tails every day together and the pounds quickly began to melt away. I realized that something about having my furry friend by my side gave me the confidence and motivation to keep pushing forward even when the going got tough. Fast–forward 130 lbs. later for me, (and 4 lbs. for Louie), and we were both fit and healthy for the first time in a long time! My newfound confidence inspired my new life's mission: to share the joy of health with overweight dog owners and their pets.I created K9 Fit Club – the first scientifically-based fitness, health and wellness program of its kind, designed for both owners and their pets! We have successfully licensed this idea in fitness facilities, doggy daycares and veterinary facilities across the US and Canada, and we are now poised to help even more people with our first brick and mortar store in St. Peters, MO.Keep reading to learn about our plan, perks you get for donating, accolades we’ve received, how your donation will be used, and testimonials from folks who’ve benefit from our program!Better You.

K9 Fit Clubs offer a friendly alternative, providing a safe environment for new participants to lose weight in a fun, motivating way. Studies have shown that dog owners are more likely to reach their fitness goals than those without canine companions. Our dogs will hound us to stay active!K9 Fit Club has enlisted the help of top veterinarians, dog behaviorists, dog trainers, fitness trainers and doctors in its quest for the perfect workout program.K9 Fit Club offers a variety of programs for people at every level of fitness, from beginners to experts, men, women, seniors, veterans, even children, and we tailor each class to specific fitness goals all in a safe, enjoyable, encouraging environment.Obesity is one of the single greatest health risks in the US for both humans and pets. Over 55% of all dogs are either overweight or obese. We've all heard the saying, ""people look like their dogs,"" and in terms of obesity, this statistic is absolutely true. We pass our bad habits on to our pets. It's time we lead our dogs not only by the leash, but by example and help them get fit!71% of adults age 20 years and over are overweight and more than one-third are obese. Additionally 17% of children aged 2-19 are obese; that's 16 million children considered overweight or obese in the US!In Missouri, our flagship location, that translates to more than 28% of the state’s youth. The current adult obesity rate in Missouri is an alarming 31.7%. K9 Fit Club wants to reduce these shocking statistics and plans outreach programs to schools where children affected by poverty can learn lifelong exercise and wellness habits and have a great time while doing it.With more than 25 licensed locations in N. America, the popularity of K9 Fit Club is nothing to bark at!

As a thank you for your contribution, we are offering a wide variety of fun perks and introductory class packages, making you an official member of K9 Fit Club!Our new space is coming along!K9 Fit Club has had amazing success so far, yet it has been difficult for us to successfully compete with popular chain gyms without a brick and mortar flagship retail location. With your support, K9 Fit Club will be able to build out our fitness center, allowing us to deliver our programs to women, families, students and schools with limited access to fitness, veterans, and seniors.Starting a business is hard for everyone, but finding funding to launch a great idea is doubly daunting for female entrepreneurs like myself. According to the Senate Small Business Committee, only 4% of all commercial loan dollars and only 2.7% of all venture capital funds go to women! And according to the National Women’s Business Council, women start their businesses with only half as much capital as men.To put it simply, women are raising less money. Often, when I approached male angel investors with my idea, I was met with investment deals that would have resulted in a loss of majority ownership in my own company - leaving no real profit after all of my years of hard work. Adding insult to injury, I also had to fend off inappropriate advances and grabby hands while trying to professionally pitch my business!In the wake of #MeToo, #Time'sUp and Women's History Month, the time is now for more women-owned businesses to help level the playing field.And that is why I am asking for your help.When you support K9 Fit Club, you also support our ability to continue to offer licensing opportunities and begin to offer franchising opportunities for women, like yourself, to run their very own fitness business, giving them the chance to take control of their own financial futures. Few other businesses offer women this unique combination of flexible scheduling, lucrative income potential, and job satisfaction. After all, who doesn't like playing with dogs all day?""This program has not only created an additional stream of revenue, it has created a fun and upbeat environment that has our clients and even our staff excited and looking forward to getting healthy!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The OptiML system allows all common smartphones to make a preliminary diagnosis for glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy without a medical professional. Globally, these retinal diseases are the leading causes of irreversible blindness with over 350 million individuals currently at risk.</p>
<p>The system consists of two parts: a low-cost, highly portable head-mount and a machine learning-based analysis system. The system works by using computer vision technology to capture high quality images on smartphones with the OptiML camera mount. These images can then be sent to an Amazon Web Services EC2 computing server and processed using OptiML’s algorithms to diagnose these diseases. After processing the images, the server can return disease diagnoses and recommendations to the phone.</p>
<p>The system is able to be used effectively by low-skilled workers, is highly cost-efficient, and portable. These unique features allow OptiML to be capable of screening significant numbers of patients for ocular diseases with high efficacy, cost-efficiency, and convenience.</p>
<p>OptiML will allow for Primary Care Physicians domestically to provide the at-risk population comprehensive eye diagnostic exams in their office or through a home-based monitoring procedure. Globally, OptiML could be very effective as a population screening tool for ocular diseases.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our current prototype is promising, but in order to move forward we need your support. Specifically, we are requesting money in order to generate prototypes with higher quality materials and gain access to larger datasets in order to develop software with a higher accuracy. Combined these progressions will allow us to create a system with unprecedented portability at a fraction of the cost of the current gold standard. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Across the globe, nearly 350 million individuals, 20 million of whom are in the United States, are at risk of losing their vision due to glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy - both of which, if diagnosed early, are treatable conditions. These numbers increase annually due to, in part, a combination of (1) the inconvenience individuals face in visiting an eye care specialist annually and (2) the lack of readily available eyecare. The result is that patients are not receiving early diagnoses, and as a result, not receiving early interventions leading to millions of cases of irreversible blindness.</p>
<p>OptiML can fix this. OptiML has the potential to aid in the early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy domestically by making retinal exams more convenient for those at risk––through self-examination or through quick exams in the offices of primary care physicians during standard checkups.  Globally, OptiML will allow medical humanitarian organizations that are already working at point-of-need locations to deliver retinal exams, which has the most potential where––in some locations––there is only one ophthalmologist for every 500,000 people.</p>

OptiML has the potential to aid in the early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy domestically by making retinal exams more convenient for those at risk––through self-examination or through quick exams in the offices of primary care physicians during standard checkups.  Globally, OptiML will allow medical humanitarian organizations that are already working at point-of-need locations to deliver retinal exams, which has the most potential where––in some locations––there is only one ophthalmologist for every 500,000 people.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>We've planted the seeds, now help us grow!</h3>
<p>Wooden Spoon Herbs is seeking your help to build out a greenhouse into a new workspace that's ten times the size of our home studio:</p>
<ul><li>My name is Lauren Haynes, the founder and herbalist behind Wooden Spoon Herbs. My journey with plants began in my early twenties while working at a health food store. I've spent the past six years deepening my relationship with so many plant friends, attending any and every herb conference and studying in a three-year program with Phyllis Light. Working with plants is definitely my passion, joy and calling.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521490113/upwsafkvc4hgaotolatg.jpg"" src=""""/>​</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Wooden Spoon Herbs began with a small handful of cash from waiting tables, and has grown over the past four years into a business bursting with life and vitality. We now have over 100 retailers worldwide, and can no longer be contained to our home studio. I am more than grateful for our growth, but it's time to upgrade to a bigger space to continue our work. With limited rental options in our rural community, we intend to build out an old commercial greenhouse structure into a 2,000 square foot workspace and office. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>This space will be a place for me to make my wares, expand my offerings and product line, host workshops and apprenticeships, see clients, grow my team and grow plants to feature in my products. With this space I will be able to keep up with the fast-paced growth that my business keeps experiencing year after year, and able to provide comfort and support to all the people seeking alternatives in their wellness journey.</li></ul>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need $30,000 dollars to build out the structure, put on a new roof, make it water tight and furnish with a three-tub sink and stainless steel workbenches. We will also use any left over funds to purchase huge storage racks so that we can finally build up a sufficient backstock of products. We love the structure because it is yards from our cabin, has wonderful bones and is already outfitted with electricity and water.</li>
<li>The main room of the structure will house production, storage and distribution, while the side room will house an office and consultation space. This is where I will see clients for one-on-one wellness appointments. (This could be you if you claim such a perk!) The main space will also be where I host workshops, and will have plenty of space for ample hands-on education.</li>
<li>Did you see our amazing perks?! Limited edition potions, wellness consultations, a series of seasonal medicine videos and exclusive artwork by Spirit Speak?!?! Brb, gotta snag a perk...</li>
<li>In the offchance we don't reach our full goal, any funds raised will still be put towards the studio! Building this studio is a nonnegotiable. We are 100% founder funded, with no investors or outside help. This studio will not only change our business, but change our lives. And we appreciate every penny of your help. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having a new workspace and growing our company will mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>More education about herbal medicine for posterity</li>
<li>A wider distribution of our gentle herbal remedies made with high-potency botanicals</li>
<li>Continuing the sustainable, living wage supply chain that we've created</li>
</ul>
<p>If my medicine has touched your life in any way, if I have touched your life in any way, please consider donating and supporting my vision and dream!

<h3>Welcome to Pretty Deadly Self Defense!</h3>
<p><a href=""http://prettydeadly.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pretty Deadly Self Defense</a> is a self defense program designed for women of every age, every body type, every skill level. Based on real-life situations, realistic settings, and in the clothes people actually wear, we are focused on the basics of natural body movement, intuition and strategy, building simple exercises and effective techniques that anyone can do.</p>
<p>Pretty Deadly Self Defense was founded in 2009 by <a href=""http://prettydeadly.org/team/susie/my-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Susie Kahlich</a>, a martial artist, storyteller, and a <a href=""https://medium.com/athena-talks/at-17-974ead99784e"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">violent crime survivor</a>.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're ready to head into production immediately -- we've already got the content, functionality, flow and design mapped out. Reaching our goal helps us take our app from great idea to great product.</p>
<p>While a lot of time, expertise and enthusiasm has been generously donated to creating this app, we do want to actually pay our developers a fair wage.  We also want to ensure that we shoot very high quality videos to make the moves even more accessible and easy to learn.  And of course, our fantastic soundtrack is produced by an independent musician,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Developers:  </strong>we will be working with 2-4 full stack U/X developers to bring this app to market and offer full functionality from the get-go. </li>
<li>
<strong>Videos (production &amp; post): </strong>Clear videos that help guide users through the moves are crucial to the app's functionality. We'll be working with a great team based here in Berlin to make sure every move is as clear and accessible as possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Legal: </strong>despite all the fun we have at Pretty Deadly Self Defense, we do train carefully and responsibly and we stress that message within the app itself. It's impossible for us to be with every app user and ensure safety though, so we need to be sure we are legally protected.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing: </strong>in addition to traditional marketing channels (social media, print ads, etc), we will be promoting the app via a <strong>workshop tour in cities across the US </strong>in June -- that's right: Pretty Deadly Self Defense is coming to <i>you</i>! </li>
<li> <strong>Design: </strong>we want to make sure that the app design is easy to follow, and visually exciting so our users stay and grow with us . Our graphic designer has solid U/X design experience ... and happens to be a graduate of Pretty Deadly Self Defense, too (she also designed our website)!</li>
<li>
<strong>Music: </strong>our user surveys overwhelmingly stressed the need for good music in apps!  So we reached out to Laura Kidd a/k/a <a href=""http://shemakeswar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">She Makes War</a>, a fully independent musician based in the UK.  She's toured all over the UK and Europe, and played with the likes of Ginger Wildheart, British Sea Power, Robin Ince, Juliana Hatfield, and Amanda Palmer, and we're thrilled to support independent artists like her.  We have a preliminary license deal in place for one track per technique to make sure users get moving and stay motivated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We want to provide funders with perks that are as useful as they are fun, and we've got some amazingly wonderful stuff to offer you at every level!  From our ""Cup of Coffee"" <strong>mug</strong> (that's a signature Pretty Deadly self defense move, by the way), to your pick of any CD by <strong>She Makes War</strong>, to the incredibly useful field guide <strong><i>Creepology : Self Defense for Your Social life </i></strong>and all the way up to <strong>being a part of the app </strong>itself.  Our favorite is <strong>livestreaming a Pretty Deadly Self Defense workshop </strong>set up just for you -- we can't wait to meet you! </p>
<p>And be sure to check in throughout our campaign for mid-term perks and last-minute surprises! We've got very cool stuff coming up! </p>
<h3>Where will the funds go?</h3>
<p>Every cent we are able to raise goes towards building the app, even if it means we only advance two steps instead of ten. We believe this app can really help a lot of people and we're committed to making it happen. We are doing this!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the ten years we've been teaching self defense, the question we most often get asked is <i>why don't more women and girls learn self defense</i>?! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549285012/jkfc0d13rshnee1zmjcy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The reasons are both emotional and sometimes physical, too: self defense courses can be expensive, and often aren't accessible to people in remote regions or areas where they don't have full freedom of movement.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549285074/roto4viaisbvdnmmcqc1.jpg"" src=""""/>The Pretty Deadly Self Defense app lets users learn basic self defense at their own pace, and in their space, and allows us to reach women and girls all over the world.

</div><div>
<p>We're keeping the cost of the app as affordable as possible so users of every socio-economic strata can access it.  And for every 10 annual subscriptions, we'll sponsor one annual subscription for an economically disadvantaged women or girl anywhere in the world.  We'll be reaching out to organizations like <a href=""https://www.writegirl.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WriteGirlLA</a>, <a href=""http://www.charliegrosso.com/hello-future/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hello Future</a> and <a href=""http://www.auratraaj.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aaurat Raj</a> to partner up.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>.Our biggest challenge is releasing the beta app in a little over two months after our campaign ends -- of the course more you give, the more developers we can hire and get the app out to you!</p>
<p>Our biggest risk is falling short of our goal and not bringing our beta version out by June 2019. But patience and perseverance are the key traits of Ninjutsu. We apply that to Pretty Deadly Self Defense, too, and we look for the opportunity in every setback.  Our funding priorities are structured for the fastest route to production, and if necessary we will compensate any shortfalls with alternative versions of the app.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>SHARE OUR CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>We know that sometimes, as much as you want to help a good cause, you just can't spare anything at the moment (we've been there too!).  But if you can spare a little bit of your  time, we'd love it if you help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to Pretty Deadly Self Defense!
Pretty Deadly Self Defense is a self defense program designed for women of every age, every body type, every skill level. Based on real-life situations, realistic settings, and in the clothes people actually wear, we are focused on the basics of natural body movement, intuition and strategy, building simple exercises and effective techniques that anyone can do.
Pretty Deadly Self Defense was founded in 2009 by Susie Kahlich, a martial artist, storyteller, and a violent crime survivor. She developed Pretty Deadly Self Defense to make self defense more accessible and easy to learn (her very first class was for her 65-year old mom!), and to make learning self defense fun.  
Having fun is really at the core of what we do. To get a taste of what Pretty Deadly is like you can watch our most recent workshop on Periscope -- for Final Girls Film Fest, we took on the horror genre's most infamous bad guys in a special workshop in Berlin.  Be sure to stay for the end and a short Q&A and find out what it really means if you freeze.
At Pretty Deadly Self Defense, we strongly believe in your natural ability. Self defense isn’t just about fighting back – it’s about knowing your boundaries, trusting yourself, your own capabilities, bringing your power into the open and never having to hide who you are.  We believe in you too -- that's why we want to bring you Pretty Deadly wherever you are, via our mobile app for iOS and Android:

</ul></div>","Thanks to everyone who contributed to our initiative  in Phase 1. Your contributions helped us donate 10,000 masks to healthcare proffesionals and essential workers, in addition to distributing 3,000 washable and reusable masks to all our amazing backers.The supply shortage problem persists and therefore, lives will be jeopardized if we stop providing masks now. There are more lives to protect and save. As many states reopen or plan to reopen soon, we are launching our second campaign to reach more people. Our new goal is to raise $1 million and distribute more than 100,000 masks to front line heroes and provide 100,000 washable masks to individuals, corporations and communities. With your continued help, we can make an even larger impact and keep our heroes and loved ones safe. We included new packages in our perks to meet your needs (Back 2 Work, Back 2 Sports and Back 2 Campus)   Using our expertise and resources in the medical and textile industries, we aim to help flatten the viral curve by providing 200,000 face masks to the general public and our frontline workers for protection against the viral infection.Due to the urgent need for masks, we will be running multiple short campaigns. This will facilitate faster production and distribution timelines and eliminate idle stock.  Your contribution will help us secure a needed shipment of KN95 Medical masks from an approved supplier as well as buy the raw materials for the fabric face masks. 
We should all do our part to flatten the curve by wearing a fabric mask.  We are selling each mask at cost so that the mask is accessible to as many people as possible. 
When you purchase your own mask, you will also be donating a KN95/ disposable surgical mask to one of our frontline heroes (Healthcare professionals and Essential workers).  You can recommend a hospital/ place in need in the indiegogo comments section.
 Due to the severe lack of essential Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in hospitals and the recent recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advising the general public to wear cloths masks in public, a group of our MIT Sloan Executive MBA classmates pooled our expertise and resources in order to help. The leader of the team, Dr. Ahmed Mady’s family, owns a textile manufacturing factory where they have dedicated two production lines to manufacture face masks at cost and have a production capacity of approximately 50,000 masks per week. They have also secured three suppliers who can provide more than 100,000 KN95 & Surgical disposable FDA approved, CDC certified masks for our frontline workers.     The N95/ KN95 masks - and the materials they're made from - are in extremely short supply right now. So, it's critical that we reserve them for those who need them most, medical professionals.    For the general public, we designed a stylish face mask that is manufactured from cotton blend/100% cotton fabric. The masks are comfortable, washable and reusable for many times. These masks will achieve more than 70% protection efficacy based on published data from University of Cambridge.The fabric masks will come in different colors and patterns for adults and children.   A new scientific rationale has indicated that wearing a fabric facemask creates a barrier that blocks projectile droplets during coughing, which may substantially reduce the production rate R, to an extent that may be comparable to social distancing and washing hands. This would then double the effect of mitigation in “flattening the curve”.

Headstrong is a protective Headband made specifically for footballers. It offers protection to the back and the side of the head where injuries are most likely – but the thin front panel allows for unimpeded heading. Headstrong is tight fitting, comfortable and stays in place - allowing for better header training and game performance.</p><h3><strong>The patented liquid core provides optimal impact reduction</strong></h3><p>The Headstrong head guard is padded at the sides and back with the patented Impact Absorption Liquid Technology (IMPALT). This ensures a more effective protection against blows to the head. Up to 80% of serious head injuries in football are caused by impact to these areas. Tests at the Virginia Tech Helmet Lab shows that the Headstrong technology offers best-in-class shock absorption.</p><h3><strong>Headstrong provides head protection</strong></h3><p>The Headstrong head guard is padded at the sides and back with our patented IMPALT silicone gel core. These are the most sensitive head areas – around 80% of serious head injuries in football are caused by impact here. The IMPALT core absorbs contact – and even hard impact.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Headstrong increases heading performance</strong></h3><p>While Headstrong is padded at the back and sides for protection, it’s thin at the front. What’s more, the front layer is optimized for heading, as it is coated with slip-resistant silicone.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Headstrong increases player confidence</strong></h3><p>Wearing Headstrong, you know you are well protected against head injuries. That’s one less major worry for a soccer player. Concentrate on your game – and rise to your aerial challenges with confidence.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Headstrong is designed for footballers</strong></h3><p>We know that a head guard is no use if it impedes your game. Headstrong is light, comfortable and made to be used in matches as well as training, and is already in use by top-flight footballer. Heading is part of football – let’s protect the footballers instead of diminishing the game.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Headstrong is backed by scientific research</strong></h3><p>A 2018 study by the University of Wisconsin proved that effective head protection reduces the risk of concussion by 50%. This sparked the idea of creating a head guard for footballers, using improved and innovative padding. Watch how it all came together – from the idea to the pitch: </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598880482/pqkci1mahjjt62czqzln.png"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2><strong>The IMPALT liquid core </strong></h2><p>Headstrong’s crucial function is the effective head protection it offers. The head guard is padded with cores of IMPALT (Impact Absorbing Liquid Technology), an innovative, patented silicone gel that absorbs and diverts the energy of impact at the sides and back of the head, significantly reducing the risk of head injury after knocks to your head’s most exposed and sensitive areas.</p><h3><strong>Two layers of Memory Foam </strong></h3><p>The liquid IMPALT core is encased in two layers of Memory Foam. The foam adds another two layers of protection and comfort in case of contact. Like the Headstrong itself, it is washable and long lasting.</p><h3><strong>Optimized for heading</strong></h3><p>While padding at the back and sides is essential for your protection, heading is still essential to your game. Headstrong not only has a thin fabric layer at the front, which frees you to head the ball – the front is also padded on the outside with a thin silicone layer, to avoid slippage and increase heading precision.</p><h3><strong>Seamless, soft and flexible</strong></h3><p>Headstrong is made for comfortably playing 90 minutes or more. It’s soft, it’s light, and it’s snug enough to stay in place, while never so tight it feels uncomfortable. It comes in three sizes, as individual head sizes are obviously different.</p><h3><strong>Inner silicone padding for better grip</strong></h3><p>A head guard has to stay in place, whether you’re dry or wet, and whether you have long, short or no hair. Headstrong stays in place – helped by an anti-slip silicone surface on the inside. It keeps your head guard from losing its position on your head when you’re running, challenging, sweating, or in other words: Being a footballer.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599056557/vpf6edlf0tjfe3epzatr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>Endorsed by top players</strong></h3><p>As part of our journey to start a football revolution, Headstrong is already being tested in training and in games by multiple professional players in the Danish top league. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and they all praise the headguard for its comfort and lightweight design. </p><p>' I have used a number of different headbands and helmets over time. After having both trained and played games with it, Headstrong has become my favorite. It is comfortable, stays in place and is the only headband that is made for heading' - Rasmus Minor Petersen, Centre-back in the Danish Superliga.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598880462/d2siojnsqn8q3eomcqzo.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Design.</strong></h3><p>Unlike most other headguards Headstrong is designed as a headband, meaning that you don’t have to worry about if you tightened the headguard properly or if the straps will come loose as you use it. We have designed our headband with an silicone coating on the inside, that ensures that the headband will stay in place even as you start to sweat and compete in aerial duels. All you have to worry about is playing <i>your </i>game.  </p><p>Headstrong gives you the confidence to rise to your aerial challenges. Knowing you’re well protected, you’re free to concentrate on improving your game.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598882142/cdd1sublvyd8rl6gic4d.png"" src=""""/></p><h2><strong>Donate to help fund the most extensive survey of the perception of protective headgear and head injuries in football in Europe.</strong></h2><p>Support our effort to raise awareness of the ever-increasing problem of head injuries in football. We are planning the biggest analysis on headgear within football in Europe. We want to create a revolution in football on how we think about head injuries and we ask for your support by donating to our campaign - or by buying you first edition Headstrong Headband.</p><p>The current discussions in the media is focused on how we treat the injuries after they have happened. We want to focus on how we can help prevent them.</p><p>To start this conversation, we need to get a better understanding of how football players perceive the notion of protective headgear in training and games as well as the potential effects of head injuries. </p><p>We want to conduct this analysis across several professional football clubs to get as large a sample size as possible and to get the survey as big as possible we need our help. A donation from you, big or small, will help us greatly with the scope of our survey, and in our greater effort the help spread awareness about a preventive approach to head injuries. So join the revolution and be a part of the change that will bring a preventive approach to the discussion of head injuries in the sport of football.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>So … why use a headguard?</strong></h2><p>We love football. We want to play the game. Watch it. Be overjoyed by it. We want the same for our kids, and their kids as well. And we want the best for the game – as well as its players.</p><p>Heading is a central part of the game. Soccer needs heading. But soccer players need protection. In training as well as in matches. This is why we created Headstrong.</p><p>Some say that head guards go against the tradition of the beautiful game. We respectfully disagree. If there is a threat to the game, it’s rules against heading being introduced around the world.</p><p>A survey of 3,000 soccer players shows that 5% of players suffered a concussion within just two years of playing. And even if you never suffer a concussion, you are aware how much it hurts when your head gets hit playing soccer. The risk affects your game. Headstrong will help protect you – and help add to your confidence.</p><p>Knowing that your head is well protected will free your training and your match performance. When rising for the ball, your thoughts should be on winning it. Not the risk of injury.</p><p>Concussions, falls and knocks to the head can cause lasting, serious head damage. This is why some federations are banning heading for kids. Heading will, however, always be a central part of soccer. And using an effective head-guard will reduce the risk of concussion by 50% (according to a 2018 University of Wisconsin Study).</p><p>We would rather see a game that takes an preventive approach to head injuries and protects the footballers’ heads – than a game where headers are banned altogether.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Protecting the head is protecting the game</strong></h3><p>Tackling wasn’t banned when the game got rough. But shin guards were made compulsory. And while some were against it at the time, most would agree today that this was a very sensible idea.</p><p>We believe that using head protection is common sense. Just like shin guards. And what would you rather protect: Your shins – or your cranium? Our research backs this up. Head guards are an effective way to reduce the risk of head injury.</p><p>Let’s not spoil the game and our young footballers by taking away their ability to train a skill that’s central to football at elite and grassroots level. Let’s give them protection and free them to be the best and most confident footballers they can be.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The minds behind Headstrong</strong></h3><p>As stated at the top we are a small team of sports fanatics, based in Denmark, with a goal to develop, design and engineer protective gear for sports. To achieve this we have started Sportect and our first focus was football because it is very dear to us.  </p><p> </p><p>The past few decades have seen a tremendous development in both professional and amateur sports. As predicted by the Olympian slogan – Citius - Altius - Fortius – athletes are becoming ever faster, go ever higher and grow ever stronger.</p><p>​</p><p>When athletes go faster, jump higher and grow stronger there are more risk of things going wrong – and that people get hurt. We see a huge possibility to take a preventive step in football when it comes to head injuries as we feel that the safety of today’s game could be improved. Look at a football/soccer game from 30 years ago. And compare it to a game from yesterday. You will see a completely different game. Players are fitter, run faster and enters p harder. Players clash in a completely different way than before. And injuries are more serious than ever before.</p><p> </p><p>Our aim is to make sports safer for the participants. And with your help we believe that it can happen so join the revolution today.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><p>We are looking for funding to help launch our product world-wide, and to develop further iterations of our product in the future. If this launch is successful, our next priority will be to start production of a kids model so the future of our sports are in great hands as well.</p><p> </p><p>Our goal is to reach 5000 Euro as this will ensure the costs for our first batch of products, and furthermore help us take the next steps towards developing a kids model of the headguard with added protection at the front.</p><p> </p><p>Our products will be produced in September and will be ready to ship from October.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598882653/gdr1ljyuw8odzsdu1nw9.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>As we are a small team, value chain management is the biggest risk to our venture.

Tests at the Virginia Tech Helmet Lab shows that the Headstrong technology offers best-in-class shock absorption.Headstrong provides head protectionThe Headstrong head guard is padded at the sides and back with our patented IMPALT silicone gel core. These are the most sensitive head areas – around 80% of serious head injuries in football are caused by impact here. The IMPALT core absorbs contact – and even hard impact. Headstrong increases heading performanceWhile Headstrong is padded at the back and sides for protection, it’s thin at the front. What’s more, the front layer is optimized for heading, as it is coated with slip-resistant silicone. Headstrong increases player confidenceWearing Headstrong, you know you are well protected against head injuries. That’s one less major worry for a soccer player. Concentrate on your game – and rise to your aerial challenges with confidence. Headstrong is designed for footballersWe know that a head guard is no use if it impedes your game. Headstrong is light, comfortable and made to be used in matches as well as training, and is already in use by top-flight footballer. Heading is part of football – let’s protect the footballers instead of diminishing the game. Headstrong is backed by scientific researchA 2018 study by the University of Wisconsin proved that effective head protection reduces the risk of concussion by 50%. This sparked the idea of creating a head guard for footballers, using improved and innovative padding. Watch how it all came together – from the idea to the pitch:  The IMPALT liquid core Headstrong’s crucial function is the effective head protection it offers. The head guard is padded with cores of IMPALT (Impact Absorbing Liquid Technology), an innovative, patented silicone gel that absorbs and diverts the energy of impact at the sides and back of the head, significantly reducing the risk of head injury after knocks to your head’s most exposed and sensitive areas.Two layers of Memory Foam The liquid IMPALT core is encased in two layers of Memory Foam. The foam adds another two layers of protection and comfort in case of contact. Like the Headstrong itself, it is washable and long lasting.Optimized for headingWhile padding at the back and sides is essential for your protection, heading is still essential to your game. Headstrong not only has a thin fabric layer at the front, which frees you to head the ball – the front is also padded on the outside with a thin silicone layer, to avoid slippage and increase heading precision.Seamless, soft and flexibleHeadstrong is made for comfortably playing 90 minutes or more. It’s soft, it’s light, and it’s snug enough to stay in place, while never so tight it feels uncomfortable. It comes in three sizes, as individual head sizes are obviously different.Inner silicone padding for better gripA head guard has to stay in place, whether you’re dry or wet, and whether you have long, short or no hair. Headstrong stays in place – helped by an anti-slip silicone surface on the inside. It keeps your head guard from losing its position on your head when you’re running, challenging, sweating, or in other words: Being a footballer.Endorsed by top playersAs part of our journey to start a football revolution, Headstrong is already being tested in training and in games by multiple professional players in the Danish top league. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and they all praise the headguard for its comfort and lightweight design. ' I have used a number of different headbands and helmets over time. After having both trained and played games with it, Headstrong has become my favorite. It is comfortable, stays in place and is the only headband that is made for heading' - Rasmus Minor Petersen, Centre-back in the Danish Superliga. Design.Unlike most other headguards Headstrong is designed as a headband, meaning that you don’t have to worry about if you tightened the headguard properly or if the straps will come loose as you use it. We have designed our headband with an silicone coating on the inside, that ensures that the headband will stay in place even as you start to sweat and compete in aerial duels. All you have to worry about is playing your game.  Headstrong gives you the confidence to rise to your aerial challenges. Knowing you’re well protected, you’re free to concentrate on improving your game. Donate to help fund the most extensive survey of the perception of protective headgear and head injuries in football in Europe.Support our effort to raise awareness of the ever-increasing problem of head injuries in football. We are planning the biggest analysis on headgear within football in Europe. We want to create a revolution in football on how we think about head injuries and we ask for your support by donating to our campaign - or by buying you first edition Headstrong Headband.The current discussions in the media is focused on how we treat the injuries after they have happened. We want to focus on how we can help prevent them.To start this conversation, we need to get a better understanding of how football players perceive the notion of protective headgear in training and games as well as the potential effects of head injuries. We want to conduct this analysis across several professional football clubs to get as large a sample size as possible and to get the survey as big as possible we need our help. A donation from you, big or small, will help us greatly with the scope of our survey, and in our greater effort the help spread awareness about a preventive approach to head injuries. So join the revolution and be a part of the change that will bring a preventive approach to the discussion of head injuries in the sport of football. So … why use a headguard?We love football. We want to play the game. Watch it. Be overjoyed by it. We want the same for our kids, and their kids as well. And we want the best for the game – as well as its players.Heading is a central part of the game. Soccer needs heading. But soccer players need protection. In training as well as in matches. This is why we created Headstrong.Some say that head guards go against the tradition of the beautiful game. We respectfully disagree. If there is a threat to the game, it’s rules against heading being introduced around the world.A survey of 3,000 soccer players shows that 5% of players suffered a concussion within just two years of playing. And even if you never suffer a concussion, you are aware how much it hurts when your head gets hit playing soccer. The risk affects your game. Headstrong will help protect you – and help add to your confidence.Knowing that your head is well protected will free your training and your match performance. When rising for the ball, your thoughts should be on winning it. Not the risk of injury.Concussions, falls and knocks to the head can cause lasting, serious head damage. This is why some federations are banning heading for kids. Heading will, however, always be a central part of soccer. And using an effective head-guard will reduce the risk of concussion by 50% (according to a 2018 University of Wisconsin Study).We would rather see a game that takes an preventive approach to head injuries and protects the footballers’ heads – than a game where headers are banned altogether. Protecting the head is protecting the gameTackling wasn’t banned when the game got rough. But shin guards were made compulsory. And while some were against it at the time, most would agree today that this was a very sensible idea.We believe that using head protection is common sense. Just like shin guards. And what would you rather protect: Your shins – or your cranium? Our research backs this up. Head guards are an effective way to reduce the risk of head injury.Let’s not spoil the game and our young footballers by taking away their ability to train a skill that’s central to football at elite and grassroots level. Let’s give them protection and free them to be the best and most confident footballers they can be. The minds behind HeadstrongAs stated at the top we are a small team of sports fanatics, based in Denmark, with a goal to develop, design and engineer protective gear for sports. To achieve this we have started Sportect and our first focus was football because it is very dear to us.   The past few decades have seen a tremendous development in both professional and amateur sports. As predicted by the Olympian slogan – Citius - Altius - Fortius – athletes are becoming ever faster, go ever higher and grow ever stronger.​When athletes go faster, jump higher and grow stronger there are more risk of things going wrong – and that people get hurt. We see a huge possibility to take a preventive step in football when it comes to head injuries as we feel that the safety of today’s game could be improved. Look at a football/soccer game from 30 years ago. And compare it to a game from yesterday. You will see a completely different game. Players are fitter, run faster and enters p harder. Players clash in a completely different way than before. And injuries are more serious than ever before. Our aim is to make sports safer for the participants. And with your help we believe that it can happen so join the revolution today. What We Need & What You GetWe are looking for funding to help launch our product world-wide, and to develop further iterations of our product in the future. If this launch is successful, our next priority will be to start production of a kids model so the future of our sports are in great hands as well. Our goal is to reach 5000 Euro as this will ensure the costs for our first batch of products, and furthermore help us take the next steps towards developing a kids model of the headguard with added protection at the front. Our products will be produced in September and will be ready to ship from October. Risks & ChallengesAs we are a small team, value chain management is the biggest risk to our venture. We already have deals established with our production facilities, and they have already begun production of our first batch of headguards. The pandemic has created some delays in our production of our product samples, but we hope that pandemic will be under control from now and not cause any further delays from our manufacturers. Other Ways You Can HelpWe would GREATLY appreciate any form of support that you can offer. Whether it be in terms of a contribution to our product or a shout-out on social media. If you would like to spread the word of the football revolution and make your friends, family and colleagues aware of our product and or vision we would really appreciate it. We need to spread the word and make the whole world know, that it is time to take a preventive approach to head injuries in football, not just a reactive approach and with your help we believe that it can happen.So feel free to share our story on Facebook at @Headstrongheadgear, Instagram at @headstrongheadgear, Twitter at @headstrongEU_ and use the hashtag #Headstrongheadgear and we will give you a like and a repost!.",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Co-founder Harvey Silverman is a 22-year veteran of the golf industry, working with various technologies to help golf course operators succeed in an increasingly difficult business. Mike Dickoff is a former Accenture partner who loves disrupting legacy technologies. Mike led the building and expansion of the Navitaire software-as-a-service business which has fueled the growth of low fare airlines around the world the past 25 years. </p>
<p>We are avid golfers who studied our evolving lifestyles and culture and created Quick.golf as a way to help golfers play more golf.  With an initial investment from three golf course operators, we've successfully proven our concept that some golfers desire the ability to play less than a full 18-hole round, or even fewer than nine holes. Quick.golf makes golf more convenient, more affordable, more fun, and easier to fit into busy lifestyles. </p>
<p>Now, we need your help expanding Quick.golf to more golf courses and from there, to more golfers.  Your contributions will give us the marketing muscle necessary to carry our message to more U.S. golf courses, and to New Zealand (we have a new partner there). And from there? Who knows? </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $25,000 to accomplish our goal of 500 Quick.golf courses by the end of 2019. About 20% of the funds will be used for a few small development improvements requested by our current course partners; the rest used for strategic marketing to golf course operators including public, municipal, resort, and management companies. If we don't quite reach our goal - we'll carry on with whatever generous contributions we receive. We have an incredibly low burn rate so we'll be able to apply a very high percentage of your funding to expansion.  </p>

About us

EquiVet Care was created from long hours of internet searching for medical information to find out whether or not a late-night trip to the Pet ER was necessary. During a public health crisis, especially, pet health care becomes exceedingly less accessible and affordable. These new challenges deeply affect the pet health care ecosystem, requiring new approaches and tools that empower concerned pet owners and veterinarians with the attainability of quality pet care. EquiVet Care is committed to providing a seamless end-to-end system that safely connects pet owners and veterinarians to better understand the medical issue a pet is experiencing, how severe it is, and lowers the minimum cost and time to recovery.

Virtual examinations
Organized medical records that help guide present and future health care decision

Risks & Challenges

Our biggest challenge is gaining traction with veterinarians to have the ability to provide 24/7 accredited veterinary support, however, a strong social media following offers long term veterinary partnership opportunities.
We have built a team of innovative veterinarians, experienced technologists, and industry leaders that can expand the reach of accessible veterinary care to every person with an internet connection. We just need your support to advance EquiVet Care to a stage where it's ready to provide the help pet owners need.

This useful wearable is also being featured by some famous brands as a fashion icon. 
 However, the problem is that the high-end jackets costing more than $500 are either really expensive or often almost impractical during day time. On the other hand, products costing from $20 to $80 are mostly of cheap quality because of using the same fabric of raincoats that makes the jackets heavy, non-breathable, unattractive, and somewhat rigid. Meanwhile the reflective layer goes off easily.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reversible | Reflective | Waterproof | Wind-resistant | Breathable | Anti-UV | Lightweight | Packable | Waterproof Pockets | Stretchable | Rip Stop | Worldwide Free Shipping 
 
 Our Secret to Deliver both Comfort and Functionality Coating of reflective material makes the fabric unbreathable and somewhat rigid. The DuoTek Ultra Performance Fabric or in short DTUP Fabric developed by the FULLFRAME DESIGN, that makes it the very first in industry to develop a unique tech fabric that is softly reflective, anti-UV, breathable and waterproof at the same time while still keeping it ultralight and comfortable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2 sides = Daytime Performance + Nighttime Performance Unlike other jackets, that are only wearable in a situation or time, the DuoTek provides you a multi-featured jacket either its day or night regardless of any season that makes it a two in one package deal. 
 Side A（GREY): Developed & designed to be reflective at night to keep you visible in dark. 
 
 Side B (BLACK): With an amazing anti-UV material, it is protecting you from Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiations. 
 
 
 
 DuoTek Never Weighs You Down Making a jacket super lightweight is just a simple task but making a Reversible Jacket with super-lightweight is on another level. Our DuoTek Jacket just weighs as much as an orange that makes it the lightest reversible jacket in the world. Isn’t this for an amazing fact!  Made to be packed easily and even much easier to carry in a daypack. 
 
 But Hey, It’s Still Really Useful Bringing you a simplistic design to provide you with both performance and comfort in a single package. 
 YKK Waterproof Pockets x 5 And Yes! Its YKK zippers provide you with not one, not two, but FIVE waterproof pockets onto this amazing DuoTek. 
 Moreover, its Rear pocket has Velcro design to store your phone safely and more conveniently when running.  
 Hood with drawstrings to keep you covered so that you can easily rack up miles in the heavy rain.  
  Machine washable for easy care. 
 
 
If you are unsure what size you are on, please simply follow your NIKE size. Also we do accept EXTRA SIZES customization.
 The sizing charts below are in US size.

 ""DuoTek Cool"" and ""DuoTek Shield"", both have the same features along with the same fabric technology and design. The only defining difference between these two products is that the ""Cool"" is thinner hence lighter than the Shield while on the other hand, the ""Shield"" is made for colder climates. The cool (250g/8.8oz) vs shield (350g/12.3oz),they look almost the same. The difference between two fabrics is less than 100g - the outermost layer (density) and the membrane which is the secret recipe we make DuoTek a performance Jacket. The Shield laminate, which is with our most advanced tech -waterproof(50,000mm)/breathability(80,000g/m2/24hrs), along with its reversibility and ultra-light, makes the Shield the professional version of DuoTek and even one of the best performance jackets on the market.
 
 - Both DuoTek Cool and DuoTek Shield come with hood/collar options.

Regardless of your activity level, protein turnover is taking place in your body at a rate of <strong>300-400g per day!</strong> While your activity level may be low, your body <strong>must still maintain sufficient amino acid levels</strong> in your blood to support your organs and other tissues. As explained above, muscle acts as the reservoir for amino acid storage in the body and when blood amino acid levels drop, <strong>muscle will be broken down regardless of your activity level.</strong> Supplementing between meals and/or before sleep with a 99% utilized EAA supplement like <strong>OptimalAmino™</strong> will increase blood amino acid levels and trigger the <strong>replenishment of muscle protein</strong> naturally lost throughout the day and night. As you can imagine, this becomes even more critical as we age.</p><p><strong>For those who fit in this category, we've created a Health Perk here on Indiegogo.</strong></p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Fitness</strong></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><u>2 servings per day.</u></i></p><p><strong>Q: </strong>I <strong>regularly exercise</strong> throughout the week and <strong>eat a healthy diet</strong>, so don't I get <strong>enough protein in my diet </strong>already?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The answer is: <strong>probably not.</strong> In addition to the standard protein turnover of 300-400g per day mentioned above, <strong>exercise stimulates both muscle protein breakdown and protein synthesis (creation)</strong>. This <strong>turnover of muscle protein</strong>, replacing older and poorly functioning muscle fibers with newer and and better functioning muscle fibers, is <strong>how we grow stronger.</strong> However, since some of the EAAs released during protein breakdown are degraded (through oxidation) <strong>beyond reuse, </strong>they cannot be reused to build new muscle protein and will ultimately be excreted as waste. To even just <strong>correct the imbalance</strong> between muscle protein breakdown and synthesis caused by exercise, you <strong>must consume sufficient EAAs</strong> in your diet through food or a calorie-efficient supplement such as <strong>OptimalAmino™.</strong> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>In addition to regular exercise I use <strong>time-restricted eating,</strong> so aren't I able to get enough protein in my eating window?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>The answer is: <strong>probably not. </strong>There are many variations of time-restricted eating <strong>like intermittent fasting (in all it's flavors - 18/6, 20/4, etc), One Meal a Day (OMAD),</strong> etc and many have reported significant weight loss by following these protocols. However, the role of body protein turnover is often <strong>significantly underappreciated</strong> in these diets and while significant weight can be lost, this often comes <strong>at the expense of muscle</strong> as well. As mentioned above, standard protein turnover is continuing throughout the day but some of the EAAs broken down from muscle cannot be reused due to oxidation and must be replaced. The <strong>negative balance of EAAs in your blood </strong>triggers even further muscle breakdown to maintain balance and this can only be <strong>reversed through the ingestion of EAAs.</strong> While EAAs may be consumed through food or supplements during your eating window, there are limits to the stimulus EAA consumption can provide <strong>at one time.</strong> Without taking a <strong>calorie-efficient, 99% utilized, IF-friendly </strong>EAA supplement like <strong>OptimalAmino™</strong> outside your eating window, there is a real risk of the <strong>undesirable loss of muscle</strong> as muscle protein breakdown begins to exceed muscle protein synthesis during time-restricted eating.</p><p><strong>For those who fit in this category, we've created a Fitness Perk here on Indiegogo.</strong></p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Elite</strong></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><i>3 servings per day.</i></u></p><p><strong>Q: </strong>I am a <strong>competitive athlete </strong>or have an <strong>intensive fitness regimen</strong> and I closely track my macros, so don't I get <strong>enough protein in my diet</strong> already?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>The answer is: <strong>probably not.</strong> In addition to the standard protein turnover of ~300g-400g per day, intensive resistance training or endurance exercise<strong> increases the rate of muscle protein turnover. </strong>The muscle protein broken down as a response to exercise provides EAAs into the blood and allows the synthesis of newer, better functioning protein to <strong>replace older muscle fibers</strong> that are not as efficient in generating force when they contract. As mentioned above, not all of the EAAs supplied through turnover are able to be reused and intensive exercise actually <strong>leads to a net loss of muscle</strong> due to increased turnover. A calorie-efficient EAA supplement like <strong>OptimalAmino™</strong>, used in conjunction with intensive resistance training or endurance exercise, can reverse the net muscle loss without the excess calories of protein found in food. Not only can <strong>OptimalAmino™</strong> be <strong>much more convenient </strong>than dietary protein for competitive athletes, it can also provide greater control in <strong>maintaining body composition. </strong></p><p><strong>For those who fit in this category, we've created a Elite Perk here on Indiegogo.</strong></p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Where do we go from here?</h2><p>The <strong>patent has now expired</strong> on this incredibly effective EAA formula that is <strong>2-6x more usable than protein from other sources</strong> and it is now available as a supplement from a few different companies.

As you can imagine, this becomes even more critical as we age.For those who fit in this category, we've created a Health Perk here on Indiegogo. Fitness2 servings per day.Q: I regularly exercise throughout the week and eat a healthy diet, so don't I get enough protein in my diet already?A: The answer is: probably not. In addition to the standard protein turnover of 300-400g per day mentioned above, exercise stimulates both muscle protein breakdown and protein synthesis (creation). This turnover of muscle protein, replacing older and poorly functioning muscle fibers with newer and and better functioning muscle fibers, is how we grow stronger. However, since some of the EAAs released during protein breakdown are degraded (through oxidation) beyond reuse, they cannot be reused to build new muscle protein and will ultimately be excreted as waste. To even just correct the imbalance between muscle protein breakdown and synthesis caused by exercise, you must consume sufficient EAAs in your diet through food or a calorie-efficient supplement such as OptimalAmino™. Q: In addition to regular exercise I use time-restricted eating, so aren't I able to get enough protein in my eating window?A: The answer is: probably not. There are many variations of time-restricted eating like intermittent fasting (in all it's flavors - 18/6, 20/4, etc), One Meal a Day (OMAD), etc and many have reported significant weight loss by following these protocols. However, the role of body protein turnover is often significantly underappreciated in these diets and while significant weight can be lost, this often comes at the expense of muscle as well. As mentioned above, standard protein turnover is continuing throughout the day but some of the EAAs broken down from muscle cannot be reused due to oxidation and must be replaced. The negative balance of EAAs in your blood triggers even further muscle breakdown to maintain balance and this can only be reversed through the ingestion of EAAs. While EAAs may be consumed through food or supplements during your eating window, there are limits to the stimulus EAA consumption can provide at one time. Without taking a calorie-efficient, 99% utilized, IF-friendly EAA supplement like OptimalAmino™ outside your eating window, there is a real risk of the undesirable loss of muscle as muscle protein breakdown begins to exceed muscle protein synthesis during time-restricted eating.For those who fit in this category, we've created a Fitness Perk here on Indiegogo. Elite3 servings per day.Q: I am a competitive athlete or have an intensive fitness regimen and I closely track my macros, so don't I get enough protein in my diet already?A: The answer is: probably not. In addition to the standard protein turnover of ~300g-400g per day, intensive resistance training or endurance exercise increases the rate of muscle protein turnover. The muscle protein broken down as a response to exercise provides EAAs into the blood and allows the synthesis of newer, better functioning protein to replace older muscle fibers that are not as efficient in generating force when they contract. As mentioned above, not all of the EAAs supplied through turnover are able to be reused and intensive exercise actually leads to a net loss of muscle due to increased turnover. A calorie-efficient EAA supplement like OptimalAmino™, used in conjunction with intensive resistance training or endurance exercise, can reverse the net muscle loss without the excess calories of protein found in food. Not only can OptimalAmino™ be much more convenient than dietary protein for competitive athletes, it can also provide greater control in maintaining body composition. For those who fit in this category, we've created a Elite Perk here on Indiegogo. Where do we go from here?The patent has now expired on this incredibly effective EAA formula that is 2-6x more usable than protein from other sources and it is now available as a supplement from a few different companies. We have tried all these products, currently use some of them ourselves, and have been very happy with the results. Unfortunately, all of these products are priced similarly (see below) and they are just way too expensive. This simply puts this amazing EAA protein replacement formula out of reach for most people.   So we have taken on the task of bringing OptimalAmino™ to market at the lowest possible price. We've hired the best contract manufacturer in the country to make this exact formula for us and, after numerous rounds of samples, we have chosen a delicious Berry Lemonade flavor. We have negotiated volume pricing to lower the production costs as much as possible and we have lined up a high-volume fulfillment partner to ensure we can get OptimalAmino™ in your hands quickly. Just last week we signed the contract, paid a large deposit to start our initial production run, and OptimalAmino™ will be ready to ship in late January or early February.OptimalAmino™ vs Leading MAP-based EAA Supplements and a Leading Whey Protein Isolate. Pricing retrieved from manufacturers' websites on 11/1/2020 and subject to change.While we want to bring OptimalAmino™ to market at the lowest possible price - more than 50% below similar products*- we refuse to compromise on quality, or use cheaper ingredients like artificial flavoring or sweeteners. But to make this incredible discount possible, we really do need your help. How can you help?If you have already discovered the incredible benefits of a supplement based on this optimal EAA ratio, you know how expensive they all are. If you are like us, you may be used to waiting for promotional sales and buying in bulk in order to lower the serving cost. WELL. NOT. ANYMORE. OptimalAmino™ will save you $540-$2100 per year over the leading brands. No discount codes, promo codes, referral links, or other ""sales"" necessary. But to ensure we can pass on these incredible savings, we do need your help. Here's what you can do today:1) Contribute as much as you can to our project here on Indiegogo and stock up on OptimalAmino™ now. This allows you to lock in the huge savings on OptimalAmino™ that we are realizing through our large initial production run and save on the cost of shipping future orders.2) Tell everyone you know about OptimalAmino™ and get them to join us here on Indiegogo. Not only will you be helping them save a ton of money while improving their health but you'll be saving your future self a lot of money by guaranteeing the long term viability of our project. Marketing is usually one of the single largest costs that drives up the retail price of supplements, but if you spread the word, we can get OptimalAmino™ in the hands of tens of thousands of people at an affordable price. We can only succeed with your support. Risks and challengesThe year 2020 has been anything but normal and supply chain disruptions are everywhere. But we plan to ship by January 2021 come hell or highwater and we have already placed a 50% deposit on our first production run. We have the premier contract-manufacturer on our team and we have a high-volume fulfillment contract in place to ensure timely delivery to our backers upon completion.We are committed to bringing OptimalAmino™ to market by the beginning of 2021 but we will promptly communicate any unforeseen supply chain delays with our community. We are in this for the long haul and excited about supporting your nutritional needs for years to come. More Questions?Check out our FAQ section here on Indiegogo or send us a message through our contact form at OptimalAmino.com. _______________________________________________________________*Compare to MAP™, PerfectAmino®, Fortagen™, Kion Aminos.**Lucà-Moretti M.

<p>Hi my name is Sunni and I have a

Feeling that you don't belong anymore


Depression, sadness and loneliness

Other Ways You Can Help I really appreciate any contribution you can make whether it is $10 or $10,000, but I understand that this is not always possible.  If you cannot make a contribution would you at least LIKE and SHARE and send out EMAILS to your network of people to get the word out. Indiegogo has share tools to make this easy for you.   I am so grateful for your contribution and feel that this is absolutely the bravest thing I have ever done in asking you for help and I really look forward to seeing some of  you on upcoming retreats.I am currently updating the website so keep checking here for full details on retreat dates, what happens at the retreats, where they will be and how you can be there.SunniLove Life By DesignNamaste & Divine LightSunni x",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>LIBERIA
MARATHON 2015 </b><b>–</b><b> A NEW BEGINNING!</b></p>
<br/>
</center></div>","The Liberia
Marathon is a professional running race in the West African country Liberia,
organized by Liberian and international volunteers.  In 2014 we were forced to cancel the annual
marathon due to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  After the epidemic has finally been kicked out
of the country, we are now preparing for the race 2015. 
Support our efforts to make an epic Liberia Marathon 2015 reality!
Every day you
can see a group of Liberian runners speeding along side Duport Road, a
jam-packed and congested road that travels from Red Light market to down town
Monrovia. They maneuver in-between fully packed yellow taxi’s, endure the blazing sun or  the infamous heavy West African rain, to
train for the annual Liberia Marathon. The first marathon was launched in 2011
and has been a big success ever since. Due to the Ebola outbreak the past year’s Marathon was postponed, leaving many of the
runners disappointed. Now Liberia has been declared Ebola free, the Liberian marathon
team is ready to start again! 
LIBERIA MARATHON 2015 –A NEW BEGINNING!










 
 The idea behind the Liberian Marathon is simple: to show Liberia and the world that Liberia is
more than Ebola, and more than the 14 horrible years of civil wars that haunted
this country. Instead, the Liberia marathon team looks forward, towards a new
beginning for a Liberia for Liberians. 
In the midst of
planning the 2015 marathon, Ebola struck. Any gathering of a larger group of
people was no longer safe and prohibited by the President. Additionally, the
medical security of our runners could not be guaranteed anymore. With heavy
hearts the team postponed the marathon and now –after Liberia has officially been
declared Ebola free–the excitement
and the passion for the race is reawakened. We are ready to plan our race for
November 8th, 2015. Why should
you support the Liberian Marathon? Our team consists of volunteers that take time on the weekend, after work, and any spare minute in between to work towards race day. Despite all
great volunteer work, a race still costs money. To ensure safety, medical tents
are set up along the race track, bananas and water handed out, and a chip
timing system is installed. To ensure everyone is able to run, the registration fees are kept extremely low.
 This is why we depend on external
support and why we depend on you.  We are ready to start organizing the 2015 Marathon - but need your support! Donate and help us celebrate Liberia, its people, and the binding force of running! Donate and kick the Liberia Marathon 2015 off its feet!

<h2>What is Yalah Yoga?</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZggVbkIAGo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">In case the video didn't load.</a></p>
<p>Jade created the Yalah Yoga brand in 2015. With the intention of always building a studio, she started with freelance classes in Morocco, offering a fun and relatable style of vinyasa yoga to anyone willing to join: tourists, expats and locals. After two years of building the brand, Jade and her partner Ouifaq are ready to open doors in Marrakech for women to discover and deepen their yoga practice, and build a cool community in the process. </p>
<p>All women of all backgrounds will be welcomed into our studio, where it will be more about sharing experiences than ending up trying to impress anybody. We want everyone to feel real and true so they can experience the opportunity for self expression and through this journey, build self confidence and acceptance. </p>
<p>We want to liberate women through yoga. </p>

<h2>Why We Care</h2>
<h3>BECAUSE YOGA ISN'T JUST ABOUT SERVING YOURSELF</h3>
<p><i>We understand the struggle. </i></p>
<p>As daily practitioners, we see the need firsthand for a space that will encourage yoga and its further teachings to women that truly want to be a part of a yoga community. We also feel that yoga shouldn't just be accessible for the ultra-chic or expat subsets. We're opening the doors to all women, and making it financially possible for them to join. Think: affordable and multi-lingual community classes, events, workshops, and volunteer opportunities for teachers to bring yoga to the mothers and daughters of rural Morocco. </p>
<h2>What We Need to Get Started</h2>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5k in funds to jump start our studio. Because we're both overachievers and we know that realistically, it will take more than that, we aim to raise double that within September and October. Our immediate needs are legal/administrative fees, real estate and equipment. With low overhead operational costs, we also plan to offer discounted pre-sale memberships to clients eager to join the studio when it opens in mid-December. </p>
<p>What you contribute goes directly to the development of something that is not only dear to our hearts, but it goes to the development of a community of women who will empower, support, and learn from one another. Why women-only? We'll occasionally offer classes for guys to experience as well, but we specifically want to create a space where women can practice freely, to get to know themselves, their minds and their bodies more, and to get to know each other. Also, because girl power. </p>
<p>We do believe that both men and women are complimentary, and each part relies on the other. However, in such a cultural context, we noticed in our previous experiences that women have yet to obtain a space where they can truly be comfortable and explorative in their yoga practice without the discomfort of perception. </p>

</p><p>Please scroll down for English</p><p>20 Temmuz 2015 Pazartesi günü öğle saatlerinde
Urfa’nın Suruç ilçesinden gelen haberle sarsıldık. Kobane’nin yeniden inşasına
destek olmak için Suruç üzerinden Kobane’ye geçmek üzere olan yaklaşık 200
kişilik bir grup, yola çıkmadan hemen önce Suruç merkezdeki Amara Kültür
Merkezi’nde yaptıkları basın açıklaması sırasından bombalı saldırıya uğradı.
Canlı bomba saldırısı sonucu 31 arkadaşımızı, kardeşimizi kaybettik. </p>
<p>Saldırının üzerinden yaklaşık iki hafta geçti.
Halen 17 arkadaşımız hastanede, ikisinin durumu ciddiyetini koruyor, hayati
tehlike sürüyor. </p>
<p>Bizler, bu saldırıyı kendimize yapılmış
sayanlar, hayatta kalan arkadaşlarımızın yaşam şartlarıyla ilgili endişeliyiz.
Her birinin, her gün yeni bir ihtiyacı oluyor, ailelerinin maddi durumları
ihtiyaçları karşılamak için yeterli değil. Devlet, sosyal bir devletin
üstlenmesi gereken sorumlulukları üstlenmiyor. Patlama sonucu çok ağır
yaralanan, uzuvlarını, hareket kabiliyetlerini yitiren arkadaşlarımız var.
Arkadaşlarımız Suruç’ta, Samsun’da, Antakya’da, Ankara’da, Antep’de, Diyarbakır’da,
Malatya’da ve İstanbul’da hastanelerde. Aileler çocuklarının başında ancak pek
çoğunun maddi kaynakları yeterli değil. </p>
<p>Burada topladığımız parayla ailelerin ve
arkadaşlarımızın öncelikli olarak sağlık masraflarına destek olmayı
amaçlıyoruz. </p>
<p>Kampanyamıza destek olan herkesle harcamalarla
ilgili detaylı bilgiyi e-posta aracılığıyla paylaşacağız. Bu kampanyanın
herhangi bir hediyesi yok, elbette her türlü desteğinizin gülümsemeyle
ödüllendirileceğine emin olabilirsiniz! Lütfen sesimizi, sözümüzü
hashtag’imizle yaymamıza yardımcı olun! #SurucIcinImece</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>We were shaken by the news coming out of Suruc, Urfa at around noon on Monday, July 20, 2015.

Urfa’nın Suruç ilçesinden gelen haberle sarsıldık. Kobane’nin yeniden inşasına
destek olmak için Suruç üzerinden Kobane’ye geçmek üzere olan yaklaşık 200
kişilik bir grup, yola çıkmadan hemen önce Suruç merkezdeki Amara Kültür
Merkezi’nde yaptıkları basın açıklaması sırasından bombalı saldırıya uğradı.
Canlı bomba saldırısı sonucu 31 arkadaşımızı, kardeşimizi kaybettik. 
Saldırının üzerinden yaklaşık iki hafta geçti.
Halen 17 arkadaşımız hastanede, ikisinin durumu ciddiyetini koruyor, hayati
tehlike sürüyor. 
Bizler, bu saldırıyı kendimize yapılmış
sayanlar, hayatta kalan arkadaşlarımızın yaşam şartlarıyla ilgili endişeliyiz.
Her birinin, her gün yeni bir ihtiyacı oluyor, ailelerinin maddi durumları
ihtiyaçları karşılamak için yeterli değil. Devlet, sosyal bir devletin
üstlenmesi gereken sorumlulukları üstlenmiyor. Patlama sonucu çok ağır
yaralanan, uzuvlarını, hareket kabiliyetlerini yitiren arkadaşlarımız var.
Arkadaşlarımız Suruç’ta, Samsun’da, Antakya’da, Ankara’da, Antep’de, Diyarbakır’da,
Malatya’da ve İstanbul’da hastanelerde. Aileler çocuklarının başında ancak pek
çoğunun maddi kaynakları yeterli değil. 
Burada topladığımız parayla ailelerin ve
arkadaşlarımızın öncelikli olarak sağlık masraflarına destek olmayı
amaçlıyoruz. 
Kampanyamıza destek olan herkesle harcamalarla
ilgili detaylı bilgiyi e-posta aracılığıyla paylaşacağız. Bu kampanyanın

<h3><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Our Story</span></strong></h3>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, I was an obese junk food junkie, working toward my bachelor’s degree in environmental chemistry.  One day I decided to apply what I learned in the lab to what was on my plate. I gave up processed foods, lost 100 pounds and I’ve never looked back.</p>
<p>After working as an organic chemist for many years, I returned to school, and have been a nutritionist for 15 years. I’ve written the internationally acclaimed book <i>The Science of Skinny</i>, and have appeared on national radio and television.  </p>
<p>Over the years, I have used many software tools to help my clients track their food and help me create individualized meal plans for them based on their needs.  There are plenty of programs that can track food and even show nutritional deficiencies, but none of them give tailored suggestions on how to fill nutrient gaps, and more importantly how to optimize food choices to prevent or manage certain common health conditions.</p>
<p>My business partner, Ernesto Amezcua, had a similar experience.  Himself, his wife and daughters experienced weight and health problems.  After spending hundreds of dollars on specialized tests to determine his disease risks and nutritional deficiencies, the testing laboratory sent him an impersonal report that provided plenty of colorful pages filled with general information about food, but little guidance on what specifically to eat and why.</p>
<p>Together, we wanted to create a program that would allow people to track their food intake and get instant feedback with the same excellent education and specific recommendations a personal nutritionist would give them, plus a lot more.  Ernesto has the background in business intelligence and software creation, and I have the nutrition knowledge.  </p>
<p>We decided to collaborate on creating something that’s never been done before, thus there is no other nutrition app, food tracker or professional nutrition analysis software that can do what HITO does.</p>
<p>As you are well aware, obesity is a worldwide epidemic. But even people who are normal weight are needlessly suffering from diet-related illnesses like diabetes, heart disease and cancer, simply because they are not educated about food and its ability to hurt or help their body.  </p>
<p>By helping us bring HITO to life, your contribution will revolutionize the way people eat, and as a result, improve millions of lives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Pledges &amp; Perks</h3>
<p>We are so close, yet so far away. According to our estimates, we need $10,000 to pay the programmers to finish the project, and we need a small army of beta-testers. That’s where you come in!</p>
<p>For just a $10 pledge, you can be one of our valuable beta-testers, giving us necessary feedback on how it’s working before we launch.  You’ll also get a one-month subscription to HITO after we launch. For a $5,000 pledge, you’ll get a lifetime subscription to HITO and much more.  We’re expecting to exceed the goal, and any extra money will go into our budget for future expenses.</p>
<p>To further help us reach our goal, we appreciate having you spread the word to everyone you know about this important project.</p>

<h3>Choose an Established Diet, or Customize Your Own</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493055595/jsojq0eupsa12wwshvpj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>HITO has been programmed with food guidelines and made-for-you menus that meet the criteria for several common diets, <strong>OR</strong> you can choose to create and customize your own balanced meal plans.  If you're not sure which diet plan is right for you, HITO can suggest one for you based on information you provide about your health goals.</p>
<p>If you are already following the Atkins Diet, Paleo, The Science of Skinny (Processed-Free) Eating Plan, Intermittent Fasting (The 5:2 Diet), South Beach, The Zone Diet, or several others, you should feel at home, because each of these diet plans are integrated into HITO.</p>
<p>Each food item in our database has been correlated for the various diet plans and phases of each plan, so if you're on Atkins Phase 1,  or South Beach Phase 2, you'll easily be able to search for the foods, recipes and menus that are suitable for your selected diet plan.</p>
<p>If you're not following an established plan and want to track food and make your own meal plans, HITO can help make recommendations to help you optimize your food choices.</p>

<p>HITO has much more power and flexibility than just one singular diet plan.  Suppose you want to follow the main guidelines of the The Science of Skinny (Processed-Free) Eating Plan, but you also want to go gluten-free, vegetarian, AND you want to eat the best foods for your blood type. HITO gives you the option to narrow your food searches so you'll only see the foods that are suitable to your particular eating plan and health goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>A Highly Intelligent Food Database</strong></h3>

<p>The power of HITO lies in it's food database, which contains over 8,000 entries providing information far beyond the standard calories, fats, carbs, proteins, vitamins and minerals,  so that it can intelligently correlate foods to meet your specific nutritional needs.</p>
<p>Are you doing your best to follow a balanced diet, but want to know which foods can help with your arthritis or lower your cholesterol?  With just a click of a button, HITO will show you the foods you want to see, and filter out the ones that are not helpful to you.</p>
<p>Each food item in the database has been individually tagged for specific criteria, such as:  </p>
<ul>
<li>It is among the top 100 known Superfoods</li>
<li>Which diet and phase of diet it is good for</li>
<li>Which health conditions it has been scientifically proven to help or hinder (for example if you have arthritis, it's best to avoid tomatoes and peppers and focus on turmeric)</li>
<li>Which phytonutrients it contains (beta-carotene, lycopene, etc.)</li>
<li>Which blood type it is suited for (according to the book ""Eat Right for Your Blood Type"")</li>
<li>Alkaline forming or acid forming</li>
<li>Low, medium or high glycemic</li>
<li>Type of carbohydrate it contains (refined or unrefined)</li>
<li>Processed-free (contains no refined sugar, flour or chemical additives)</li>
<li>Gluten-free</li>
<li>Allergy-free (soy, egg and dairy)</li>
<li>And many other identifiers</li>
</ul>
<p>HITO's food database is also categorized according to foods of particular interest, for example the fruits are categorized by berries, citrus, and melons, and the vegetables are categorized by dark green leafy, non-starchy, starchy, cruciferous, and nightshades.  This makes it easy for you to make sure you're getting all the right types of fruits and veggies into your meal plans.</p>
<p>Other foods, such as legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and dairy products also have specified categories to help you find foods easily.</p>

<p>Not getting enough vitamin E and iron to meet your daily needs?  HITO shows you a list of foods that not only contain vitamin E and iron, but ALSO makes sure they meet the requirements of your chosen diet plan.</p>
<p>Are you a 30-year old female with a high stress job who also wants to lower cholesterol and release 20 pounds?  HITO's Ad Hoc feature will also show you a list of foods that contain nutrients needed to combat stress, lower cholesterol, boost metabolism and balance blood sugar to help release weight and help you fill your nutrients gaps so you can optimize your health.</p>
<p>If you have a fitness wearable such as a Fitbit or Withings device, it can be integrated with HITO to track your activity level---then HITO can recommend the foods that contain the nutrients you need to help optimize your workouts.</p>

Short Summary Hi everyone, this is VietxNepal speaking! VietxNepal is a fundraising project for Nepal after the double earthquakes on April 25th and May 15th 2015, initiated by 4 high school students in Vietnam and the United States. Proudly presented as a key project in a fundraising campaign founded by Summit Education Service (Hanoi,Vietnam), VietxNepal storms in Indiegogo and takes over it as the main crowdfunding platform for the project!  

Why we start this campaign  

Nepal earthquake, also known as the Gorkha earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.8Mw, on April 25 has left behind many devastating consequences to the people of this nation. According to The Guardian, until now, the total death toll has climbed over 8000, along with 16000 injured and 30000 building destroyed. A magnitude 7.4 aftershock struck Nepal 17 days later on May 12, further exacerbated the conditions there. Therefore, VietxNepal is founded with the purpose of encouraging the Vietnamese to make certain donations to Nepal via fundraising channel.

<p>
</p>
<p><u>Seeing Possibilities:</u></p>
<p>Because of poor crop yields in Kasaka, Zambia, many
children in the region were unable to go to school. Due to the dire need to
contribute to their farms, most were not encouraged to get an education. With a
focus always on producing food, children who did manage to attend school
experienced a very high student to teacher ratio and extremely poor learning
conditions.</p>
<p>The Enactus team at Lambton College concluded the key
to success was developing more secure and predictable farming. Enactus Lambton
believed implementing “One Seed,” an innovative farming and
entrepreneurship project, would increase corn production, combat food
insecurity and create a revenue source to supply resources for the local
school.</p>
<p><u>Taking Action:</u></p>
<p>The team started by partnering with a Canadian
agronomist to develop a three-day workshop on the many differences
between their traditional plow farming and modern no-till practices. This
workshop taught the farmers the importance of conserving soil moisture,
the disadvantages of plowing in drought conditions, proper seed spacing
and planting depth and good use of fertilizers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436197404/b7168at1defxksz7jkkr.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 501px;height: 376px;""/></p>
<p>Next, the team sectioned two acres of land on
the Kasaka Basic School property, where they helped to implement these new
methods with 40,000 seeds of corn. By educating and empowering local
farmers to employ more modern and innovative farming practices, harvest yields
were five times those of previous years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<u>Enabling Progress:</u></p>
<p>By transforming farming practices, the “One Seed”
project increased corn production by five times and revenues by seven
times, created 41 jobs, started seven small businesses, processed 150
micro loans and generated $623,000 in economic impact.</p>
<p>Education was the next focus for this rural community.
The school building has been expanded and a solar lighting system
implemented to extend class hours.</p>
<p>Enactus Lambton built two new houses for
teachers, allowing the school to hire four new teachers and eliminate a decades
old shortage of teachers. Enrolment at the school is up 15% over last year
and 15 students are heading to high school.</p>
<p>The Kasaka basic school has gone from the worst
ranked school in their district to the number one ranked school – in just two
years. </p>
<p></p>

<p><u>What’s Next?</u></p>
<p>As nursing students, we brought a new element to the
One Seed project in rural Zambia. Throughout our first and second trip, we completed
a medical needs assessment of the clinic in the village of Kasaka. The
conditions were deplorable – no electricity, dirt floor, no running water. The
clinic was often out of basic medications and immunizations that are required
for babies and children under five. There were cockroaches and termites
crawling around the maternity ward and the women expressed their fear of
falling asleep and waking up in the morning with bites all over their bodies. The
HIV rate is approximately 40% of the population and growing, along with a high
percentage of infectious disease, deaths from diarrhea, malaria, and pregnancy
related deaths, such as hemorrhage. There are two nurses that manage the clinic
and one janitor, who’s primary role is as a pharmacist administering
medications. </p>
<p></p>
<p>                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436198511/fvl5w4igqcjdnk29pr6a.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 449.78px;height: 337px;""/></p>

<p>In May of 2015, we took our third trip to Zambia, this time
exploring another village nearby called Gaali. Our plan was to complete a
similar needs assessment as we had done in Kasaka the year prior; however, this
clinic was different. It was a 6x10 room with a dirt floor and one small window.
That was it – an empty room with nothing. It was used as an outpost clinic,
meaning that one nurse traveled here once a month to provide prenatal health
care to pregnant women and an immunization clinic. The women, often with young
children or pregnant, would walk three hours with no water and<span>  wait outside in either the scorching heat or
pouring rain for care once a month. At that moment, our goals shifted. It was
clear that there needed to be a medical clinic in Gaali. We met with the
community health officials to discuss what they wanted to see in Gaali in terms
of healthcare. They all asked for assistance in creating a clinic. We are now
planning to build from the ground up in Gaali, creating a medical facility as
well as staff housing.</span></p>
<span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436201850/z6kt54hs5xj9hndficxa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div><div>
<span></span>
<p><span>We will also continue to help the Kasaka clinic and any
extra materials we receive in the process of building the clinic in Gaali, we
will provide to the Kasaka clinic. By contributing to this project, you will
not only help create a clinic in this area, but develop a sustainable long-term
future for the people in this community. Health education, prevention and
promotion will all be fundamental in the future of health care for rural
Zambia. </span></p>
</div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need </h3><div> </div><p>Our initial goals with the One Seed project have
been met and the agricultural side of the project is now taking root in
multiple areas of Zambia now. Our new goal is to raise $50,000.00 through
crowdfunding to help kick start the complete build of a health clinic in Gaali,
Zambia. Every dollar raised goes 100% towards the project and after each trip
you can find pictures of us doing the actual work. One Seed is a project made
through Enactus Lambton College which is completely student led. As nursing
students, we pay our own way to Zambia, Africa with the help of family and
friends. Any money fundraised is used for the project with absolutely no
overhead costs as Lambton College is self-sustainable.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436202547/eui1xakkfll9kdgvfknn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p></p><div>Once our goal is met, approximately 14,000 lives
will have access to adequate health care that otherwise meant walking over 16km
for the nearest care (three hours for a healthy adult). Currently, at eight months pregnant, women begin their walking journey to the
nearest hospital to stay there until they deliver their baby. Building a clinic
in Gaali would completely decrease the over capacitated hospital that is in
Monze and provide care to the surrounding area that once was only available by
one nurse, once a month. </div><div>

</div><ul> </ul><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div> </div><p> </p><div>Multiple issues in the Zambian area are surrounded
by start-up costs that are virtually impossible for the community to afford.
Our project focus on the initial start-up costs values independent sustainability.
</div><div>The One Seed project is well respected in the surrounding area of Monze and the
focus has previously been on agriculture and education. One Seed has been able
to build a rapport with the communities in Monze and in the villages of Kasaka
and Gaali. Schools have been built and refurbished and the government has been
able to support the changes by integrating more teachers for the education
system in Kasaka, Zambia. This is the same outcome we are optimistic for within
the medical aspect of the project. Although we have had great success with
support in the past, we are still in the midst of ensuring government support
is there prior to building the clinic. At present, it seems we are going to get
all of the necessary government support. </div><div>The focus is now on fundraising for
the complete build in Gaali. However, if by chance the government provision is
unattainable, the money will be spent on refurbishing the medical clinic in
Kasaka. There are many areas the money can be spent within the medical world
for this community. In Kasaka, there is a clinic that is currently supported
from the government so it will benefit either way. This will include medical equipment, fumigating
the insects (cockroaches), building a well for clean uncontaminated water,
implementing infection control interventions, beds and ultrasound for antenatal women, medical
texts and health teaching for all staff.</div><div>

</div>
<p>If you are a Lambton College student, you can become
a member of the team and do the labour with us! We have a variety of students
that bring all different qualities to the team from business to nursing to
computer programming students. The area in Zambia is in need of many things and
we are an educational institute, so teaching and learning is what we do! </p><p>Another
goal of ours is to receive as many in kind donations (Medical equipment) as
possible. Part of our fundraising cost will eventually go towards shipping a
sea container filled with as much equipment as possible. Our number one goal is
to build the clinic in Gaali while simultaneously fixing up the clinic in
Kasaka. While the areas are both in a great need, Gaali has absolutely nothing
at this point and this is why we have chosen to focus here and have Kasaka
benefit from the residual effects of working in Gaali. </p><p>We are looking for any
and all medical equipment. Supplies are great for the start-up, but our focus
is on the sustainability portion. This is why collaboration within different
sectors is important. We understand if you cannot help financially, but if you
can help spread the word about One Seed and our goals, we can get our name out
there and help out a wonderful community. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436204226/b3rquuxlzmcpa60rpcf5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

workshop taught the farmers the importance of conserving soil moisture,
the disadvantages of plowing in drought conditions, proper seed spacing
and planting depth and good use of fertilizers.

          
Next, the team sectioned two acres of land on
the Kasaka Basic School property, where they helped to implement these new
methods with 40,000 seeds of corn. By educating and empowering local
farmers to employ more modern and innovative farming practices, harvest yields
were five times those of previous years.


Enabling Progress:
By transforming farming practices, the “One Seed”
project increased corn production by five times and revenues by seven
times, created 41 jobs, started seven small businesses, processed 150
micro loans and generated $623,000 in economic impact.
Education was the next focus for this rural community.
The school building has been expanded and a solar lighting system
implemented to extend class hours.
Enactus Lambton built two new houses for
teachers, allowing the school to hire four new teachers and eliminate a decades
old shortage of teachers. Enrolment at the school is up 15% over last year
and 15 students are heading to high school.
The Kasaka basic school has gone from the worst
ranked school in their district to the number one ranked school – in just two
years. 

                
What’s Next?
As nursing students, we brought a new element to the
One Seed project in rural Zambia. Throughout our first and second trip, we completed
a medical needs assessment of the clinic in the village of Kasaka. The
conditions were deplorable – no electricity, dirt floor, no running water. The
clinic was often out of basic medications and immunizations that are required
for babies and children under five. There were cockroaches and termites
crawling around the maternity ward and the women expressed their fear of
falling asleep and waking up in the morning with bites all over their bodies. The
HIV rate is approximately 40% of the population and growing, along with a high
percentage of infectious disease, deaths from diarrhea, malaria, and pregnancy
related deaths, such as hemorrhage. There are two nurses that manage the clinic
and one janitor, who’s primary role is as a pharmacist administering
medications. 

                 

                


In May of 2015, we took our third trip to Zambia, this time
exploring another village nearby called Gaali. Our plan was to complete a
similar needs assessment as we had done in Kasaka the year prior; however, this
clinic was different. It was a 6x10 room with a dirt floor and one small window.
That was it – an empty room with nothing. It was used as an outpost clinic,
meaning that one nurse traveled here once a month to provide prenatal health
care to pregnant women and an immunization clinic. The women, often with young
children or pregnant, would walk three hours with no water and  wait outside in either the scorching heat or
pouring rain for care once a month. At that moment, our goals shifted. It was
clear that there needed to be a medical clinic in Gaali. We met with the
community health officials to discuss what they wanted to see in Gaali in terms
of healthcare. They all asked for assistance in creating a clinic. We are now
planning to build from the ground up in Gaali, creating a medical facility as
well as staff housing.


        


We will also continue to help the Kasaka clinic and any
extra materials we receive in the process of building the clinic in Gaali, we
will provide to the Kasaka clinic. By contributing to this project, you will
not only help create a clinic in this area, but develop a sustainable long-term
future for the people in this community. Health education, prevention and
promotion will all be fundamental in the future of health care for rural
Zambia. 
  What We Need  Our initial goals with the One Seed project have
been met and the agricultural side of the project is now taking root in
multiple areas of Zambia now. Our new goal is to raise $50,000.00 through
crowdfunding to help kick start the complete build of a health clinic in Gaali,
Zambia. Every dollar raised goes 100% towards the project and after each trip
you can find pictures of us doing the actual work. One Seed is a project made
through Enactus Lambton College which is completely student led. As nursing
students, we pay our own way to Zambia, Africa with the help of family and
friends. Any money fundraised is used for the project with absolutely no
overhead costs as Lambton College is self-sustainable.     The Impact Once our goal is met, approximately 14,000 lives
will have access to adequate health care that otherwise meant walking over 16km
for the nearest care (three hours for a healthy adult). Currently, at eight months pregnant, women begin their walking journey to the
nearest hospital to stay there until they deliver their baby. Building a clinic
in Gaali would completely decrease the over capacitated hospital that is in
Monze and provide care to the surrounding area that once was only available by
one nurse, once a month. 



    Risks & Challenges  Multiple issues in the Zambian area are surrounded
by start-up costs that are virtually impossible for the community to afford.
Our project focus on the initial start-up costs values independent sustainability.
The One Seed project is well respected in the surrounding area of Monze and the
focus has previously been on agriculture and education. One Seed has been able
to build a rapport with the communities in Monze and in the villages of Kasaka
and Gaali. Schools have been built and refurbished and the government has been
able to support the changes by integrating more teachers for the education
system in Kasaka, Zambia. This is the same outcome we are optimistic for within
the medical aspect of the project. Although we have had great success with
support in the past, we are still in the midst of ensuring government support
is there prior to building the clinic. At present, it seems we are going to get
all of the necessary government support. The focus is now on fundraising for
the complete build in Gaali. However, if by chance the government provision is
unattainable, the money will be spent on refurbishing the medical clinic in
Kasaka. There are many areas the money can be spent within the medical world
for this community. In Kasaka, there is a clinic that is currently supported
from the government so it will benefit either way. This will include medical equipment, fumigating
the insects (cockroaches), building a well for clean uncontaminated water,
implementing infection control interventions, beds and ultrasound for antenatal women, medical
texts and health teaching for all staff.
      Other Ways You Can Help 

If you are a Lambton College student, you can become
a member of the team and do the labour with us! We have a variety of students
that bring all different qualities to the team from business to nursing to
computer programming students. The area in Zambia is in need of many things and
we are an educational institute, so teaching and learning is what we do! Another
goal of ours is to receive as many in kind donations (Medical equipment) as
possible. Part of our fundraising cost will eventually go towards shipping a
sea container filled with as much equipment as possible. Our number one goal is
to build the clinic in Gaali while simultaneously fixing up the clinic in
Kasaka. While the areas are both in a great need, Gaali has absolutely nothing
at this point and this is why we have chosen to focus here and have Kasaka
benefit from the residual effects of working in Gaali. We are looking for any
and all medical equipment. Supplies are great for the start-up, but our focus
is on the sustainability portion. This is why collaboration within different
sectors is important. We understand if you cannot help financially, but if you
can help spread the word about One Seed and our goals, we can get our name out
there and help out a wonderful community.",15.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Ed and Gene founded Oral Fluid Testing (OFT) Laboratories, LLC in 2007.  For ten years they ran a company that provided pulmonary testing and drug and alcohol screening for various companies.  The US Department of Transportation was one of their largest clients.  This niche market allowed them a gateway into building safer working environments.  Almost immediately, the team identified major challenges with the accuracy of the industry-standard urine test. First, the large number of options for tests to be tampered with, thus skewing the tests’ results, were well-known and widely used.  A rapidly developing market was flooding health food and vitamin stores; drinks, powders, and shakes designed to assist donors in beating a test, in addition to many well-known tricks from experienced test-takers, was making accurate testing more difficult.  Second, the undignified nature of providing urine collection is embarrassing and opens the door to accusations of sexual harassment and embarrassment.</p>
<p>Blood draws are the second most common type of diagnostic test. They are painful, create medical waste, risk potential infections, and are overall inconvenient and costly.  Eventually oral fluid testing was introduced, and Ed and Gene diligently set to work designing a procedure to collect oral fluid samples with DOT standard collection procedures in order to ensure accuracy and security of the sample and paper work.  This process identified major challenges with the collection process and demonstrated saliva test results were even easier to manipulate. While collaborating with several laboratories, Ed and Gene had scientists compare a lab-based urine test with some of the saliva tests on the market. A surprisingly high number of the saliva tests were coming back as false negatives; the saliva test was being beat as well.  Gene and Ed couldn’t help but imagine there were better, easier options.</p>_____________________________________________________________________________</span></div><div>

After years of research and clinical trials Oral Fluid Testing Laboratory LLC, has developed a new PAIN-FREE screening test for lead and other heavy metals present in the body.Dr. Robyn
Hannigan Inventor 
Founding
Dean, School for the Environment
University
of Massachusetts, Boston.A double blind clinical trial was conducted at Emory University Children’s Hospital in conjunction with the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Atlanta, GA and University of Massachusetts, Boston.  More than 500 children between the ages of 6 months to 6 years were tested.  The research results, soon to be published in The Journal of Clinical Toxicology, show that oral fluid is in all cases more reliable than any saliva test and in fact is as reliable as a venous blood test, because blood plasma is being collected in the oral fluid.Dr. S Lynn Gardener, one of the authors of the study, presented our “Non-Invasive Lead Testing Technology” at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Conference in October 2009 and received much praise and support from the attendees.  The study demonstrated that by using OFT’s patented collection and testing procedures, the results comparing the non-invasive, painless oral swab procedure versus an invasive painful blood test were extremely accurate.The new screening test kit “Toxyscreen”, a product of OFT Labs, is designed to make it easy for concerned parents to test their children. All information needed for proper collection and fast, easy test results is in the Oral Fluid Screening test kit delivered right to your door.The blood plasma collected in the oral fluid can not only detect drugs but also heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury,  Cadmium, Aluminum, Arsenic, Zinc Copper and Chromium, poison, and almost anything else a standard blood test can find.  This includes recreational and prescription drugs, hormones, HGH, and maybe even different types of cancers--all with just an easy swab of the gum line.                                                              TOXYSCREEN KIT                                    _____________________________________________________________________________Oral Fluid Testing Laboratory, LLC. PATENT On November 9, 2010, the U.S. Patent Office issued OFT Labs Patent #7829340. This patent clearly indicates that the results of the oral fluid testing procedures are as accurate as venous blood samples.  Using OFT’s patented collection and testing procedures, the results comparing the non-invasive painless test versus an invasive painful blood test were 99.19% accurate.  Lead is measured in Ug/Dl, or micro-grams per deciliter [1 µg/dL = 5 ppm (parts per million)].  Simply put, the instrument is well within the capabilities of being able to produce an accuracy well over 1,000 times the current accuracy used, even accounting for sample dilution and instrument error.After 10 years and exhausting all their resources including pensions, mortgages, and contacts and resources of close family and friends, their hard work and dedication to research and clinical trials has paid off.   Oral Fluid Testing Laboratory LLC, has developed a pain-free screening test for lead and other heavy metals present in the body.  The first of many products to come, Toxyscreen was designed to make it easy for concerned parents to check their children for lead and mercury poisoning, which cause learning disabilities and may be one of the leading causes of Autism.  All information needed for proper collection and fast, easy test results is in the Oral Fluid Screening test kit delivered right to your door.____________________________________________________________________________Why did OFT Labs decide to start with heavy metal testing ?There is no way of escaping it; there is going to be a paradigm shift in medical testing, from blood to oral fluid for all screening and diagnostic testing for the future.  Gene and Ed are hoping to help usher in this change with heavy metal testing.  Why did they choose to start with lead testing?  Lead testing is a federally mandated test that children should receive annually.  Doctors and pediatricians are required to provide lead testing to Medicaid children under the Child Wellness Program.  The CDC’s Health Care Financing Administration policy requires that all children enrolled in Medicaid receive a screening blood lead test at age 12 and 24 months (for more information please review the CDC’s Eliminating Childhood Lead Poisoning:  A Federal Strategy Targeting Lead Paint Hazards).  Dr. Anil Mangla Lead Scientist & designer of the study, presented our “Non-Invasive Lead Testing Technology” at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) National. Additionally, OSHA requires heavy metal testing for workers in fossil fuel power plants, oil refineries, trash-to-steam power plants, construction sites, and solid waste/recycling jobs.  Add to that the growing concern by the general public to ensure safety from environmental harm due to poor air, water, and food quality conditions.  Each of these parties are currently subjected to intravenous blood testing, which is painful and has to be conducted by a doctor’s office or laboratory.  This is a golden opportunity to provide an easier option.Toxyscreen is a painless, dignified way to meet these needs.  New Jersey alone spends 28 billion dollars a year on health and education problems for residents affected by lead poisoning.  This is not just an inner-city problem but a suburban problem not yet realized. Millions could be saved if Toxyscreen was used for early detection and mapping problem areas.  Construction companies, schools, and businesses that test new employees or do random testing could also save money on collection fees and time saved in doing the test on site by a trained professional.  Doctors can conduct collection right in their office.  If a person does test positive, immediate treatment can begin.This test is easy, economical, efficient, and environmentally friendly.  Oral fluid-based testing techniques can be implemented for all testing from heavy metals, abused drugs both illegal and prescribed, HGH growth hormones, and medical screening._____________________________________________________________________________What do you Learn from TOXYScreen?This enormous, patented discovery identified by sheer persistence to find an option for more dignified testing, would eliminate the need to draw blood to detect overexposure to lead and heavy metals.  Toxyscreen is a screening tool you can use now to test your family’s and pet’s levels of four toxic heavy metals: lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Heavy metals are potentially deadly elements that can cause a host of health problems. Often heavy metal poisoning is misdiagnosed, and patients may not receive the correct treatment.  Lead tests in particular often go undone because the hazard of lead poisoning are unknown though fairly common, and parents don’t want the challenge and anxiety of a blood draw. The chart below summarizes common sources and effects of heavy metals that OFT Labs provide testing for.  These details were gathered by OFT from OSHA.Who should be tested?Anyone can participate, but Toxyscreen particularly benefits children; elderly patients who have a hard time getting out to a lab for a blood draw, struggle with clotting or finding a good vein for intravenous draws; and anyone who is fearful of a needle.____________________________________________________________________________Canine's are included!                                                                      
This testing is also for your four-legged friend/family member.  Lead poisoning is a common source of accidental poisoning in pets, mainly puppies. If you have a pet that is diagnosed with lead poisoning, chances are that you may have been exposed as well.  The potential sources of lead for domestic animals are numerous and widespread. Ingestion of lead-based paints is the most commonly identified source of lead in poisoned cats and dogs. Other lead sources are toys, improperly glazed ceramic water or food bowls, contaminated tap water, and children's chalk.  Prior to the introduction of oral fluid testing, diagnosis of lead toxicity always involved a traumatic blood test.How does testing work?  We send you a kit, which includes detailed instructions and pictures regarding how to take the test. You take a sample (painless, easy, simple) and you mail it back. We send you the results by mail and/or email.
____________________________________________________________________________  
Benefits of TOXYScreenToxyscreen is a home kit to test lead and heavy metals screening test for you, your family, and even your pets.  The use of a needle is eliminated, creating a pain-free testing method.  The risk of infection, anemia, and thrombosis are eliminated.  The test is conducted by a quick swab of the gum line, compared to the time consuming and painful process of having a nurse squeeze your finger until a large enough blood specimen is obtained.  The test can be conducted in the safety of your home, eliminating the hassle of scheduling an appointment and visiting a doctor’s office or lab.  It is pain-free, fast, efficient, and accurate. With approval from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) (please see Use of Funds section below for details), this test can be commercially available for lead and heavy metal testing that can be conducted at your medical facility, school, sport facility, manufacturing/processing facility, power plant, construction site, day care, etc by your company safety director with exceptional benefits.
The testing is painless. No fear and anxiety of a blood draw.
The specimen is obtained quickly, unlike the blood draw, which requires the phlebotomist to squeeze the donors finger until a large enough specimen is collected.
A licensed phlebotomist is not needed because individuals or internal personnel, trained to collect samples, easily conduct the test without the risk of being exposed to blood borne hazard.
No risk of infection, anemia, or thrombosis for the donor.
Personnel can be tested by your company Safety Director with exceptional benefits and cost savings.
There is no medical waste.  Oral fluid is not considered a biohazard, thus disposal costs are substantially reduced. The test kit is environmentally friendly and its plastic container can easily be recycled.






Samples do not require special handling or preservatives. Once oral fluid is collected, it does not have to be refrigerated. This is an advantage if collecting in remote areas such as third world countries. Testing can be performed anywhere in the world.

The testing is inexpensive. The at-cost value of the test is equivalent to a blood test.  It would not be an additional financial burden to provide the test if it was covered by insurance companies.
Sizable direct savings result from reduced donor wait time. There is no need to coax children into subjecting themselves to a finger stick to collect a capillary blood specimen. There is no need to travel to a doctor or lab with an elderly relative or individual with disability.
Oral fluid specimen collection is quick and easy. An experienced, trained collector could collect up to 20 specimens per hour!
The testing is private.  All samples are sent to OFT Laboratories to be analyzed.  Results are confirmed via an ICP/MASS SPEC technology.
The test can be completed in your own home or at your place of business/work.
No equipment is required beyond the swab kit, making this test a viable option for providing testing in third world countries.

_____________________________________________________________________________Use of FundsEd and Gene believe in the technology they have discovered, and their mission and goal is the development of analytical techniques and instruments for identification and measurements of chemicals in biological and non-biological matrices.  By providing easy collection and accurate measurements of a wide range of organic and inorganic substances, OFT hopes to become the international standard and resource center for those industries requiring compliance testing, surveillance and monitoring testing.  This is why we need your supportHopefully, you are inspired by the opportunities oral fluid testing has already proven to hold, and you will choose to be part of this paradigm shift in medical testing.  Your pledged funds will be used to integrate OFT’s heavy metals test into the current market and expand oral fluid testing beyond heavy metals.  OFT has hundreds of possible markets for expansion including medical offices, independent labs, schools, airlines, the hospitality industry, athlete testing, military personnel, MEDICAID recipients, and employers who drug test.  With further clinical trials, they hope to expand oral fluid metals testing to other heavy metals, steroid testing in sports, drug testing in fatal accidents, and examining its potential for identifying different types of cancers. Our highest priority, with your support, is to seek FDA and CLIA approval, which would allow doctors to offer the test to patients and would begin the process of obtaining approval for coverage by insurance companies.  The FDA approves laboratory tests for screening diseases or conditions, and Toxyscreen needs this approval in order to be accepted as a lead and heavy metal screening test beyond home screening.  CLIA provides certification and oversight of clinical laboratory testing, and will be required once OFT Labs begins providing testing beyond the studies conducted at University of Massachusetts, Boston.  OFT Labs is currently in the process of seeking FDA approval via their team of lawyers.This requires research, time, paperwork, and promotion of the test. With enough funding, OFT Labs can license the oral fluid screening test to state, private, and hospital laboratories, providing onsite, or at minimal, regional testing facilities in order to increase efficiency of test to provide quicker results.  We will also have to address debt and expenses acquired from obtaining the patent, studies, and internal research.__________________________________________________________________________Your pledge funds will be used to:
manufacture the kits to collect your sample and analyze the results (which includes the purchasing reagents, ICP/MS equipment.
design and development the website.
hire key management and outstanding lab personnel.
conduct additional clinical trials.
research and develop capital for supplies, additional lab equipment, and training in order to expand into other states.
seek FDA and CLIA approval (costs include lawyer fees for communicating with FDA, travel, and promotion funds).
build and/or rent new testing facilities, in order to expand opportunities, increasing the efficiency of the test to provide quicker results.
settle previous debt acquired from obtaining the patent, printing and marketing Toxyscreen packaging, and initial work with University lab to conduct the study.
conduct studies in low income communities.

Finally - A single medical record How many times have your filled out your medical history? Almost every single visit to your doctor, right? How about the fact that your doctor does not have the most up-to-date information? Our system provides:
A LIVE Electronic Healthcare Record that all physicians, nurses and medical personnel can securely access from anywhere and whenever they are authorized access.
Did you move? Did your phone number change? Securely complete and update your medical history in the convenience of your own home. Your medical record will immediately be updated with the latest information. Anytime your medical record is accessed, you receive notification.
Doctor B has access to the same information as doctors A and C. No need to write things down for the next doctor to see or to transfer data, which is costly and time consuming.      Saving Lives & Setting Standards Paper medical records are hard and costly to share between physicians, and even the current electronic records in place today are problematic.  Proprietary or closed systems and information is often incompatible between systems. Many systems currently in place today were built using 1966 technology (MUMPS) with the only update being in 1995, two years before the first smartphone was introduced.
It was disclosed in a Senate hearing on July 17 2014  that:

In the United States over 400,000 people die every year due to medical mistakes
That equates to 1096 people life lost EVERY SINGLE DAY

Preventable medical errors persist as the No. 3 killer in the U.S. - third only to heart disease and cancer
There is minimal standards in place for electronic medical records


    Medical Fraud  Healthcare fraud costs the country tens of billions of dollars every year. This is one of the reasons why our healthcare insurance premiums increase every year. It’s a rising threat, with national healthcare expenditure estimates exceeding $3.6 trillion in 2014, with spending continuing to outpace inflation. US health spending growth is projected to average 5.8% annually through 2022.  In 2014 the FBI estimated that Medicare (our tax dollars ) paid over $98 Billion in fraudulent claims.  The FBI also estimates that private insurers (Blue Cross, Aetna, Athena, etc.) paid well over $600 Billion last year. These numbers continue to increase.
It is estimated that using our Electronic Healthcare Records Management System can provide at least 35% savings. This is due to built-in security and fraud prevention - smartcard and biometrics. We can help prevent fraud on the front-end at the patient/doctor visit before it occurs.



    Create a Cohesive Environment

<p>
Few years ago we wondered why so many talented kids sports is not noticed. Often so many years of work, effort, and - what is also important - financing by the parents. At some point, a young man doesn't want to fulfill himself / herself in sport anymore.
</p>
<p>
After many conversations with representatives of various social groups, analyzing many cases we have come to the conclusion that one of the main reasons of this situation is being unnoticed and unappreciated properly by people from the sports industry, or even by peers.
</p>
<p>
We decided to develop a system that will help all the kids, especially those from poorer backgrounds, in building their sporting career, making dreams come true and above all in improving themselves.
</p>
<p>
With given time we began to understand that this platform will be useful not only for kids, but actually for all people interested in sport and we worked out the right tools for each group to do it.
</p>
<p>
And that's the <b>DBXSport</b> project.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439051341/qblu2uk4oylw4pufaxdy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 631.833px; height: 446px;""/></p>

<p>
<b>Competition</b> - The basic problem and the need for the athlete is his / her VISIBILITY, whose components are competition, the need of success, education and scouting.
</p>
<p>
A child with sports talent often has no incentive to continuous development. After some time he / she experiences discouragement, and as a result he / she wasted his / her talent.
</p>
<p>
Parents try to solve the problem through continuous involvement of their attention, motivation to further work (including video recording and posting them on YouTube, contests, competitions which are often held in bigger cities). But often, after some time comes the tiredness and they give up sport.
</p>
<p>
The need of success - One of the main reasons for giving up sport by young players is the limited ability to compare their achievements with others, compete, or the opportunity doesn't bring spectacular effects (it is not noticed by somebody more than the local environment). Currently the competition in many environments has limited range of influence.
</p>
<p>
Social organizations, youth, and parents organize local competitions. Winning teams rarely bring novice athletes something more than the satisfaction and a plastic cup. It also affects discouragement and resignation of their sporting career after some times.

<b>Scouting</b> - Headhunters try to find talented young athletes. Then they sign a contract, or monitor their progress. The problem is the selectivity of observation. Seekers cannot constantly keep track of all young athletes, so they often overlook a potential talent.
</p>
<p>
Also parents and attendants in order to help their own child's sports career try to get in touch with them. Taking the time and attention also significantly affects the cost of raising a young athlete pursuing a career.
</p>
<p>
These are the main problems faced by young athletes and their parents.
</p>
<p>
The problems have been identified based on a series of public consultations - interviews with different groups - parents, young people (age 5-15 years), coaches and athletes (soccer, badminton, basketball), managing small sports clubs.
</p>
<p>
As part of the research project we done interviews with coaches i.e. from Legia Warszawa - Poland, Leeds United - GB, with badminton, basketball coaches and
players, lawyers working for basketball first league clubs in Poland and psychologists, sports workers, parents of children involved in sport.

Few years ago we wondered why so many talented kids sports is not noticed. Often so many years of work, effort, and - what is also important - financing by the parents. At some point, a young man doesn't want to fulfill himself / herself in sport anymore.


After many conversations with representatives of various social groups, analyzing many cases we have come to the conclusion that one of the main reasons of this situation is being unnoticed and unappreciated properly by people from the sports industry, or even by peers.


We decided to develop a system that will help all the kids, especially those from poorer backgrounds, in building their sporting career, making dreams come true and above all in improving themselves.


With given time we began to understand that this platform will be useful not only for kids, but actually for all people interested in sport and we worked out the right tools for each group to do it.


And that's the DBXSport project.






It is a service for all people associated with sport, especially young athletes (age from 5 to 17) and trainers. It also has a wide offer for:


Fans
Sttendants of young Athletes
Sport Staff
Journalists
Scouts
Sports Clubs
Judges
Other groups interested in sport (Producers, Organizations, etc.)


It helps to develop children and young people by giving them a lot of tools to improve their skills. It provides access to the best coaches and trainers from all over the world. It allows you to compete on many levels, from the courtyard and the district until even the whole world.


It makes coaches and clubs easy to find and train talented players. They can track the progress of individual users and sign contracts with them. It also gives coaches the tools for daily work in sport (i.e. how to do a training, develop sets of exercises, communication with the players, the club and other people who are in the database - the club staff, sports doctors, parents of young players) and gives real opportunities to make money by performing the daily sports activities.








The hopes and plans related to sports are universal for every young person in the world.



Basic things that he / she struggle with are: learning how to play, joining a group, having the opportunity to compete and dialogue, and BEING NOTICED by professional sport world.


The high sports skills transfer in high salaries and great social ennoblement. That's why young people and their parents particularly in poorer regions try to accomplish this, in their opinion - simple life career path.


And DBXSport service makes this goal easier.



DBXSport feeds an universal, global need of being noticed, especially among people who are not rich.


Our project has an effective and tried mechanism to gain a large number of active users. It gives a real opportunity for training in the chosen field of sport.

A real opportunity to earn,
Mechanisms to find a sponsor,
Ability to take part in competitions and other service events,
Possibility to organize events and invite other users,

Functional tools for daily work, such as calendar, statistics, communications system integrated with social networking sites,
Enables parents to track children's sports work, communicate with the coach and club,
A lot of other attractive features, including cheap shopping in a new and innovative system.






YOUTH ACTIVE PLAYERS (age 5-17 years) - the main group of recipients.

Competition - The basic problem and the need for the athlete is his / her VISIBILITY, whose components are competition, the need of success, education and scouting.


A child with sports talent often has no incentive to continuous development. After some time he / she experiences discouragement, and as a result he / she wasted his / her talent.


Parents try to solve the problem through continuous involvement of their attention, motivation to further work (including video recording and posting them on YouTube, contests, competitions which are often held in bigger cities). But often, after some time comes the tiredness and they give up sport.


The need of success - One of the main reasons for giving up sport by young players is the limited ability to compare their achievements with others, compete, or the opportunity doesn't bring spectacular effects (it is not noticed by somebody more than the local environment). Currently the competition in many environments has limited range of influence.

GERMAN* * * * * Rücken oder Nacken verspannt ? * * * * *Wir haben die Lösung gefunden !Das Triomag Magnetsystem.Der Triomag ist ein neues innovatives Magnetprodukt. Er verfügt über die stärksten marktüblichen Magnete. In mehr als 3 Jahren Entwicklungszeit und vielen Tests wurde er erfolgreich gegen die üblichsten Muskelverspannungen getestet. Hierbei ergab sich die heutige Dreieck Form.

Der Triomag überzeugt nicht nur wegen seiner geringen Baugröße und Gewicht, sondern auch durch sein starkes und tiefgehendes Magnetfeld.
So wurde bei ihm mit herkömmlichen Messinstrumenten eine Magnetspitze von ca. 12 cm gemessen.




Der Triomag ist so konzipiert, dass er sich fast allen Körperformen anpassen kann.
Erste Erfolge bei der Anwendung treten ca. nach 2 – 3 Stunden auf.
Der Triomag vermag auch sehr starke Muskelverspannungen z.B. in der Lenden Gegend, Nacken, Schultern zu lösen. Bei der Anwendung z.B. gegen Nackenverspannungen hat sich gezeigt, dass ein beidseitiges auflegen linker und rechter Seite zu besseren Ergebnissen führt, da Muskeln  immer im Verbund miteinander arbeiten.

Der Triomag kann ab 2 Stück durch das Kleidungsstück gehalten eingesetzt werden und bedarf dadurch keiner weitern Hilfsmittel wie z.B. hautfreundliches Klebeband.
Wir die Hersteller Firma Trionis empfehlen jedoch ein Packet von min. 8 Stück.

Der Triomag ist ein Qualitätsprodukt made in Germany und wird auch dort zu 100% gefertigt.

Der Triomag ist aus sehr robusten Lebensmittelechten Kunststoff und daher besonders hautfreundlich gefertigt und ist praktisch nur unter Gewaltanwendung zerstörbar.


Der Triomag wird durch ein aufwendiges Fräsverfahren in Handarbeit hergestellt.



Der Triomag ist für Muskelverspannungen konzipiert, im Zweifelsfall kontaktieren sie bitte immer einen Arzt (Fachmann).
Tasten
 sie den Verspannungsbereich durch sanftes Drücken z.B. mit dem Daumen 
ab. Legen sie den Mittelpunkt des Triomags (vorzugsweise die weiße Seite
 den Nordpol) auf das Zentrum des Verspannungsbereiches. 
Legen
 sie nun einen zweiten bzw. dritten Triomag hinzu, so dass sich diese im
 Randbereich anziehen. Die Farben weiß (Nordpol) und schwarz (Südpol) 
wechseln sich ab!
Es
 handelt sich hier um ein Magnetprodukt mit sehr starken Magnetfeldern 
(1,29 - 1,32 Tesla). Dieses Produkt wurde über 3 Jahre getestet, dabei 
wurden keinerlei negative Auswirkungen festgestellt. 
Negative
 Auswirkungen können wir jedoch nie ganz ausgeschlossen werden. Die 
Sicherheitshinweise im Umgang mit starken Magneten liegen dem Produkt 
bei.
Im Zweifelsfall kontaktieren sie bitte immer einen Arzt (Fachmann).

Der Triomag wurde von der Firma Trionis entwickelt und ist ein Wellness Produkt.

Der Triomag ist kein medizinisches Produkt!

Es werden auch keine Heilversprechen gegeben.",4.0,2,"1 Campaign

Sencillamente por que en Burgos viven los dos hijos de Ángel, Andrés, de 11 años, y Miguel, de 9 años, y queremos

rental options. Why near Burgos? Simply because in Burgos live the sons of
Angel, Andres, 11 years old, and Miguel, 9 years old, and we want to be a
significant part of the project.</i></p>
<p><b><span>Y tenemos una ventaja</span></b><span>: Al ser una <b>instalación no inmueble</b>, tenemos total libertad a la hora de
modificar la situación del campamento cuando lo consideremos necesario. El
emplazamiento no ha de tener más condicionantes que la cercanía al Camino de
Santiago, una tierra fértil, y una superficie de al menos 1.000 metros
cuadrados para albergar todas las instalaciones. Si la parcela es urbana,
tendremos acceso a electricidad, y no necesitamos más acometidas, a lo sumo

Podemos mover el campamento en
cuestion de una o dos semanas. Esa es una de las premisas de este proyecto, la
libertad a la hora de movernos. No es nuestra intención movernos continuamente,
pero si que sentimos que es algo muy especial poder mover el albergue a lo
largo del Camino de Santiago.</span></p>
<p><i><b>Place</b>: The location of <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/FleurAngel-Yurta-Camp/1630683643816514"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><b><b><b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/FleurAngel-Yurta-Camp/1630683643816514"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FleurAngel Yurta Camp</a></b></b></b></b> is flexible. We can move the camp in one or two weeks. That's one of the
premises of this project, freedom when moving. We do not intend to move
continuously, but we feel is something very special we can move the place if we
need along the “Camino de Santiago”.</i></p>
<p><b><span>Alquiler del terreno:</span></b><span> La ventaja que tenemos ahora es que los
terrenos están parados, no tienen explotación, nadie los usa, por lo que es
mejor tenerlos alquilados por bajo alquiler (200 euros/mes es nuestro tope) que
por alquiler cero. Y además ofrecemos la posibilidad al propietario de disponer
de la parcela cuando quiera, ya que nosotros, siempre con un tiempo prudencial,
podemos movernos a otro emplazamiento en cuestión de semanas.</span></p>
<p><i><b>Rental area</b>: The advantage we have now
is that the land they stand, no exploitation, nobody uses, so it's better to
have them rented by low rent (200 euros/month is our stop) or may be donated
rental. And also we can offer the possibility to have the owner of the place
whenever, because we always with a reasonable time, can move to another site in
a matter of weeks.</i></p>

of accommodation of the Castilla and Leon.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Agua, luz y calefacción</span></b><span>: Esta claro que una parcela urbana cuenta con
todos los servicios, abastecimiento de agua, luz, gas, telefono e internet,
pero en este caso nuestro proyecto solo precisa de electricidad (procuraremos
ser autosuficientes también en este aspecto), y a lo sumo, abastecimiento de
agua (a la que trataremos para evitar el cloro). Si optamos por una parcela
rústica, no tendremos abastecimiento en la parcela, pero incorporaremos
generadores de electricidad si fuera preciso el uso de electricidad, y
utilizaremos depósitos de agua que reutilizaremos y potabilizaremos.</span></p>
<p><i><b>Water, electricity and heating</b>: It is
clear that an urban place has all services, water, electricity, gas, telephone
and internet, but in this case our project only needs electricity (also we want
to be self-sufficient in this regard) and at most, water (whithout chlorate).
If we choose a rustic plot, we have no supply in the place, but incorporate
generators if is necessary the use of electricity and use water tanks without
chlorate.</i></p>
<p><b><span>Construir yurtas, aseos, etc.:</span></b><span> El montaje de las Yurtas es algo muy sencillo,
se requiere una pequeña instalación para el aseo o la cocina, una base de
madera, sobre la que se monta la tienda, en aproximadamente dos dias. Lo mismo
para el desmontaje.</span></p>
<p><i><b>Build yurts, toilets, etc.: </b>The work to
build this yurts is very easy. An small tubes for toilet or kitchen, a wooden
base on which the structure is mounted, in about two days is finish. Same for
dismantling.</i></p>

Dos personas, dos culturas, dos vidas 


Two people, two cultures, two lives
un alma, un sueño!




a soul, a dream!

¿Cómo empezó todo?-How did it all?: “CAMINOFUNDING”

¡Hola!. Somos Fleur, Holandesa,
y Ángel, Español. Nos conocimos a
finales de noviembre de 2014 en el Camino de Santiago. Ángel era hospitalero voluntario
en un bonito albergue cerca de León 
(Albergue Verde) y Fleur una peregrina buscando su nuevo camino. Fue
amor a primera vista, como si nos conociéramos de toda la vida. Ese momento
cambió nuestras vidas por completo. Poco después, en febrero de 2015, Ángel decidió correr el riesgo, dejar toda su vida en Burgos, donde vivía entonces trabajando como profesor de Universidad, para empezar una nueva vida con Fleur
en Holanda. Después de unos meses juntos en Holanda, es Fleur la que deja todo,
y corre el riesgo, volviendo junto a Ángel a España a hacer realidad el sueño que juntos tuvieron en Holanda, el mismo día, por separado. UNA VISION: Crear un hogar-albergue para ofrecer nuestras capacidades a los que las
necesiten, siendo pioneros en ello.


Hello!. We are Fleur, Dutch, and Angel,
Spanish. We met in November 2014 in the Albergue near Leon (Albergue Verde) and
Fleur a pilgrim seeking his new way. We are in love in the first moment, as if
we knew of a lifetime. That moment changed our lives completely. Shortly
afterwards, in February 2015, Angel decided to take a risk, leaving his entire
life in Burgos, where he lived working as a university professor, to start a
new life with Fleur in the Netherlands. After a few months together in the
Netherlands, which leaves everything is Fleur, and take the risk, returning to
Spain with Angel to realize the dream that together they had in the Netherlands
the same day separately. A VISION:
Create a home-Albergue to offer our skills to those who need them, being
pioneers in this.

Después de tomar esta
decisión, Ángel tuvo un sueño en el que hacían juntos el Camino de Santiago,
consiguiendo el dinero necesario para crear el albergue, haciendo un “CAMINOFUNDING”. Ahora estamos en esa
aventura. Haciendo el Camino de Santiago, el “Camino Francés”, como auténticos peregrinos,
con una tienda de campaña y sin dinero, confiando
en la generosidad de la gente, y procurando conseguir la confianza de los
peregrinos y amigos que encontremos para que nos ayuden en este proyecto. Todo
el dinero que podamos recaudar durante la aventura, será para financiar el
proyecto. A su vez, queremos lanzar esta iniciativa a todo el mundo, no solo a
los peregrinos y amigos que nos encuentren en persona. Para ello lanzamos esta
campaña en   INDIEGOGO: “ALBERGUE DE YURTAS: FLEURANGEL YURTA CAMP”.
After making this decision, Angel had a
dream that did together the Camino de Santiago, getting the money needed to
build the dream, making a ""CAMINOFUNDING"". We are now in this
adventure. Doing the “Camino de Santiago”, the ""French Way"" as
genuine pilgrims, with a tent and without money, relying
on the generosity of people, and trying to get the trust of pilgrims and find
friends to assist us in this project. All the money that we raise for the
adventure, is to finance the Albergue. In turn, we want to launch this
initiative to everybody, not only to pilgrims and friends meet us in person. To
do this we launched this INDIEGOGO campaign: “ALBERGUE DE YURTAS: FLEURANGEL YURTA CAMP”. 

     ¿Cual es vuestro sueño?-What is your dream?:  “FleurAngel Yurta Camp”
Ocho meses después de conocernos, hemos decidido vivir nuestro sueño:
Eight months after we met, we decided to live our dream:

Ofrecer un hogar-albergue
en el Camino de Santiago. 
Offering a home-Albergue in the Camino de Santiago.

SU NOMBRE- THE NAME: FleurAngel Yurta Camp

Un albergue diferente, formado por acogedoras
y sencillas tiendas Yurta Mongolas alrededor de un huerto ecológico.
Un lugar especial en el que Fleur y Angel quieren transmitir su mensaje de
amor a través de su estilo de vida.
A different hostel, with cozy and simple Mongoilan Yurt tents around an organic garden. A special place where we want to give our message of love through our lifestyle.

                                    
Un lugar que cualquiera puede visitar (peregrino o no), cuando quiera, y
convivir así con Fleur y Angel el tiempo que sea preciso.



A place that all people can visit
(pilgrim or not), at any time, and so live with Fleur and Angel as long as
necessary.
El equipo que forman Fleur y Angel trabaja “desde dentro” y “desde fuera”
en encontrar soluciones para las personas que necesitan un cambio de estilo de
vida, tanto mental como nutricional, tanto de creencias y costumbres como de
conocimientos de alimentación y hormonales. “Desde dentro” a través de la
especialidad de Fleur (Especialista
en Nutrición y equilibrio hormonal), y “desde fuera” a través de la
especialidad de Ángel (inteligente, sensible y espiritual. Una combinación de coaching, empatía, experiencia
personal, inteligencia, sensibilidad, honestidad, escucha profunda y
comprensión de las circunstancias personales de cada uno, y su facilidad de
encontrar conexiones que facilitan las soluciones necesarias). Fleur y
Angel se compenetran perfectamente en este equipo ya que Fleur a su vez tiene
una gran sensibilidad y aporta su ayuda desde el exterior, y Angel posee una
experiencia nutricional y espiritual personal desde la que aporta ayuda desde
el interior.

The team are working FleurAngel
""from the inside"" and ""outside"" to find solutions for people
who need a change of lifestyle, both mental and nutritional, beliefs and
customs of both knowledge as power and hormonal. ""From within""
through specialty Fleur (Nutrition Specialist and hormonal balance) and
""outside"" through specialty Angel (Intelligent, sensible and
spiritual, a combination of coaching, empathy, personal experience,
intelligence, sensitivity, honesty, listening and deep understanding of the
personal circumstances of each, and ease of finding connections that provide the
necessary solutions). FleurAngel works perfectly together in this team and
Fleur in turn has a high sensitivity and provides support from the outside, and
Angel has a personal nutritional and spiritual experience from which provides
and help from the inside.
Durante ese período de convivencia en FleurAngel Yurta Camp, compartirán trabajos, y cada
instante, cada día, cada momento, escucharán y entenderán todas las
circunstancias personales. Con paciencia y confianza, se irá cocinando la
respuesta o respuestas que cada persona está esperando de FleurAngel, la solución que está buscando. Cuando llegue ese
momento, transmitimos la solución, y mientras llega, contagiamos alegría,
descanso, confianza, fuerza y valor para afrontar los miedos y disfrutar los
cambios, enseñamos a tomar riesgos, y mostramos nuestro estilo de vida, sobre
alimentación y salud interior y exterior.


During that period of coexistence in FleurAngel Yurta Camp, share
work, and every moment, every day, hear and understand all personal
circumstances. With patience and trust, will go cooking the answer or answers
that everyone is waiting from FleurAngel, the solution you are looking for. When
that time comes, we transmit the solution, and while arrives, infect joy, rest,
confidence, strength and courage to face fears and enjoy the changes, taught to
take risks and show our way of life, power and inner health and outside.
Lo más importante: PACIENCIA.
No existe el tiempo. Tanto Tú como FleurAngel necesitamos tiempo para dejar que
se cocine la solución, Por tanto, no hay límite de tiempo de convivencia con
FleurAngel, no hacemos terapia por horas ni sesiones preparadas ni utilizamos
métodos tradicionales. Dejamos que el contacto personal haga su trabajo y por
tanto el valor de nuestra ayuda no está condicionado por el tiempo que cada
persona conviva en FleurAngel Yurta Camp. Dependerá del valor que cada persona dé a
nuestro trabajo. Solo hay un compromiso, el de a ayudar a cubrir los gastos de
consumo y cama en FleurAngel Yurta Camp durante su estancia.


Most importantly, PATIENCE. There is no
time. You and FleurAngel need time to let, therefore no solution time limit
coexistence with FleurAngel cook, we don´t do therapy sessions for hours and
prepared or used traditional methods. The value of our help is not conditioned
by the time each person living side by side in FleurAngel Yurta Camp. It depends
on the value that each person gives to our help. There is only one commitment,
to help cover the costs of consumption and FleurAngel Yurta Camp. bed during your
stay.
NO hay Internet, no hay televisión o radio, no se puede fumar, no hay
alcohol (ni dentro ni fuera de FleurAngel Yurta Camp), no hay azúcar, sin gluten, sin productos químicos, y
SÍ productos ecológicos. Usaremos,
en la medida de lo posible, agua no clorada y baños secos, y procuraremos
siempre ser autosuficientes.


No internet, no TV or radio, you can not
smoke, no alcohol (either inside or outside FleurAngel Yurta Camp), no sugar, no
gluten, no cow milk, no chemical products, and, yes!, organic products. We will use, as far as
possible, non-chlorinated water and dry toilets, and always try to be
self-sufficient.
Después de un largo proceso de cambio en nuestras vidas, y de trabajo de
conocimiento personal, sabemos que ESTA
ES NUESTRA MISIÓN. Todas las señales apuntan a que además ES EL MOMENTO DE COMENZAR. Es muy
importante para nosotros el apoyo, pero más lo es para las personas que están
esperando nuestro FleurAngel Yurta Camp.
Sabemos que muchísima gente desconoce la necesidad de conocer qué come y
cómo lo come y cuales son las consecuencias de una mala alimentación y un mal
hábito alimenticio. A su vez, es importante para todo el mundo saber como
influye un desequilibrio hormonal. Y todo esto está íntimamente relacionado con
el estado emocional, los traumas, miedos, carencias emocionales, y caminos de
vida alejados de lo que realmente quiere cada corazón.
After a long process of change in our
lives, work and personal knowledge, we know that this is OUR MISSION. All signs
tell us THIS IS THE TIME TO START. Is very important for us your help, but this
help is more important for people who are waiting for our FleurAngel Yurt Camp.
We know that many people need to know
what and how they eat and what are the consequences of a poor diet and poor
eating habits. At the same time, it is important for everyone to know how to
influence hormonal imbalance. And this is closely related to the emotional
state, affraid, fears, emotional needs, and ways of life away separated from
what really want every heart.

                        ¿Qué necesitais?-What do you need?:  “10.000 €”



Tenemos una estimación general de inversión total de cerca de 30.000 euros para concluir el montaje
proyectado de FleurAngel Yurta Camp.
We estimate an overall investment of
nearly 30,000 euros to complete the installation projected FleurAngel Yurta Camp.
Partimos con un capital inicial
de aproximadamente 10.000 euros, y
sabemos que podemos obtener el dinero restante en nuestro CROWDFUNDING de INDIEGOGO y en nuestro “CAMINOFUNDING”. Utilizaremos
todo nuestro potencial, nuestra imaginación y creatividad para lograr muchísima
ayuda en nuestro “CAMINOFUNDING”, (y os aseguramos que somos especialistas en
encontrar la mejor solución para todo, somos dos Leos!!!). Todo el dinero
recaudado tanto en “CAMINOFUNDING” como en  INDIEGOGO, se invertirá en poner en marcha FleurAngel Yurta Camp. 
We start with an initial capital of
about 10,000 euros, and we know we can get the remaining money in our
CROWDFUNDING INDIEGOGO and our ""CAMINOFUNDING"". We will use all our
potential, our imagination and creativity to achieve tremendous help in our
""CAMINOFUNDING"" (and we assure you that we specialize in finding the
best solution for all, we are two Leos !!!). All money raised both
""CAMINOFUNDING"" and  INDIEGOGO, will be invested in implementing
FleurAngel Yurta Camp.


Estimación de inversión
                                                         Investment estimation

No obstante, para poner en marcha FleurAngel Yurta Camp NO es preciso
comenzar con la inversión total.
However, to implement FleurAngel Yurta Camp is NOT necessary to start with the total investment.
En una primera fase estimamos
una inversión de aproximadamente 20.000
euros, lo necesario para instalar dos yurtas como habitaciones, una yurta para el salón cocina comedor, cocina, mesas, sillas, camas, mantas, menaje y
otra yurta para los baños, a la vez que empezamos a cultivar en el huerto.
In the first phase we estimate an investment
of around 20.000 euros. We need this to install two yurts as rooms, a yurt for
the kitchen, tables, chairs, beds, blankets, utensils and other living yurt for
baths, while we begin to grow in the garden.
En una segunda fase se
ampliará el campamento con otra yurta habitación, la urbanización, el vallado,
iluminación natural de la urbanización, gallinero, zonas de descanso, camas,
sábanas, mantas,  mesas, sillas, y lo
necesario para la ampliación con 8 camas más, lo que estimamos en algo menos de
10.000 euros.
In a second phase with another yurt as room, the urbanization, fencing, natural lighting urbanization, roost, rest areas, beds, sheets, blankets, tables, chairs, and we want to expand the place with another 8 beds more, which we estimate at just under 10.000 euros.

Por tanto, EL CAPITAL que con el
que lanzamos la campaña de CROWDFUNDING en  INDIEGOGO (y paralelamente con “CAMINOFUNDING”) es de 10.000 euros, lo suficiente para cubrir los 20.000 euros de la primera fase.

Therefore, THE CAPITAL that the campaign we launched in   INDIEGOGO CROWDFUNDING (and in parallel with ""CAMINOFUNDING"") is 10,000 euros, enough to cover 20,000 euros for the first phase.

Sabemos que lograremos el 100% del objetivo inicial con CROWDFUNING y “CAMINOFUNDING”.
Aun así, a principios de octubre,
comenzaremos el proyecto FleurAngel Yurta Camp con todo el capital que tengamos, aunque sea menor de 20.000 euros. Por tanto, sea cual sea el resultado de la campaña de
CROWDFUNDING en  INDIEGOGO y “CAMINOFUNDING”, está garantizada la creación del proyecto.
We know that we will achieve 100% with
CROWDFUNING and ""CAMINOFUNDING"". Still, in early October, we will start
the project FleurAngel Yurta Camp  with all the capital we have, even if it is
less than 20,000 euros. Therefore, whatever the outcome of the campaign
CROWDFUNDING in  INDIEGOGO and ""CAMINOFUNDING"" is guaranteed the
creation of the project.

¿Dónde va a estar FleurAngel Yurta Camp?-Where will it be?: “Camino de
Santiago”.
¿Dónde va a estar FleurAngel Yurta Camp ?. En el Camino
de Santiago. Esa es una condición o premisa. En un terreno fértil para el
huerto bio-ecológico, esa es otra de las premisas. Un terreno de al menos 1.000
metros cuadrados, para albergar cómodamente todas las instalaciones Probablemente en los alrededores de Burgos
capital. Tenemos varias opciones de alquiler. ¿Por qué cerca de Burgos?
Sencillamente por que en Burgos viven los dos hijos de Ángel, Andrés, de 11 años, y Miguel, de 9 años, y queremos
que sean una parte importante del proyecto.
Where will be FleurAngel Yurta Camp?. In
the “Camino de Santiago”. That is a condition or premise. In a fertile ground
for bio-organic garden, that is another of the conditions. A field with at
least 1.000 square meters, probably around Burgos capital. We have several
rental options. Why near Burgos? Simply because in Burgos live the sons of
Angel, Andres, 11 years old, and Miguel, 9 years old, and we want to be a
significant part of the project.
Y tenemos una ventaja: Al ser una instalación no inmueble, tenemos total libertad a la hora de
modificar la situación del campamento cuando lo consideremos necesario. El
emplazamiento no ha de tener más condicionantes que la cercanía al Camino de
Santiago, una tierra fértil, y una superficie de al menos 1.000 metros
cuadrados para albergar todas las instalaciones. Si la parcela es urbana,
tendremos acceso a electricidad, y no necesitamos más acometidas, a lo sumo
abastecimiento de agua.
And we have an big advantage: We don’t
want to be the owners of the place we build the FleurAngel Yurta Camp, so we
have complete freedom to change the situation of the Yurta Camp when we need. If
the place is urban, we have access to electricity, and we don’t need more
connections, may be water.
El terreno que utilizaremos será preferiblemente donado para su uso o
alquilado. El alquiler de la parcela no
será mayor de 200 euros/mes y se cubrirá con los beneficios de la
actividad.
The land use will preferably be donated
for use or rented. F we need to rent, the rent for the place shall not exceed
200 euros/ month and covered with the benefits of the activity.


¿Creéis que podéis encontrar desafíos durante el comienzo?-Do you think you can find challenges during the start?:  
“Nos gustan los
desafíos. Y nos gusta tomar Riesgos. Son oportunidades de conseguir algo
maravilloso, que ni podemos imaginar”-""We like challenges. And we like to take risks. They are opportunities
to get something nice, we can’t even imagine"".
Para nosotros son oportunidades.
Siempre ganamos tomando riesgos, y siempre aprendemos de las situaciones que
aparentemente son difíciles, y disfrutamos. Esto es uno de los mensajes de
nuestro estilo de vida.

Al mismo tiempo, nosotros pensamos que cualquier situación, por
complicada que parezca, siempre es lo mejor que puede pasar por el bien del
proyecto, y viene con la solución incorporada, solo necesitamos confianza y
paciencia, y seguir nuestra intuición.

Are opportunities for us. Taking risks
always win, and always learn from situations that are seemingly difficult and
enjoyed. This is one of the messages of our lifestyle.
At the same time, we think that any
situation, however complicated it may seem, is always the best thing to happen
for the sake of the project, and comes with built-in solution, only need
confidence and patience, and follow our intuition.
Nuestro proyecto cuenta con muchísimas ventajas:
Our project has more advantages:

Terreno: El emplazamiento de FleurAngel Yurta Camp es flexible. Podemos mover el campamento en
cuestion de una o dos semanas. Esa es una de las premisas de este proyecto, la
libertad a la hora de movernos. No es nuestra intención movernos continuamente,
pero si que sentimos que es algo muy especial poder mover el albergue a lo
largo del Camino de Santiago.
Place: The location of FleurAngel Yurta Camp is flexible. We can move the camp in one or two weeks. That's one of the
premises of this project, freedom when moving. We do not intend to move
continuously, but we feel is something very special we can move the place if we
need along the “Camino de Santiago”.
Alquiler del terreno: La ventaja que tenemos ahora es que los
terrenos están parados, no tienen explotación, nadie los usa, por lo que es
mejor tenerlos alquilados por bajo alquiler (200 euros/mes es nuestro tope) que
por alquiler cero. Y además ofrecemos la posibilidad al propietario de disponer
de la parcela cuando quiera, ya que nosotros, siempre con un tiempo prudencial,
podemos movernos a otro emplazamiento en cuestión de semanas.
Rental area: The advantage we have now
is that the land they stand, no exploitation, nobody uses, so it's better to
have them rented by low rent (200 euros/month is our stop) or may be donated
rental. And also we can offer the possibility to have the owner of the place
whenever, because we always with a reasonable time, can move to another site in
a matter of weeks.
Licencias: Las tiendas Yurta Mongolas no son un bien inmueble, por lo que podemos
instalarnos donde queramos, siempre previa consulta al Ayuntamiento implicado.
No es preciso cumplir normativa de edificación.
Licenses: Mongolian Yurt stores are not
a property, so that we can settle where we want, always after consultation with
the Goberment Technic. You need not comply with building regulations.
En cuanto a la normativa de alojamientos en Castilla y León, dependiendo
de la opción por la que nos decantemos a la hora de gestionar el albergue,
tendremos la opción de cumplir o no cumplir dicha normativa. Todo dependerá de
si nos decantamos por solicitar ayudas a la Junta de Castilla y León. En estos
momentos no es nuestra intención. Por lo que la gestión del FleurAngel Yurta Camp será diferente a la de la normativa de
alojamientos de la Junta de Castilla y León.

About the rules of lodging in Castilla y
León, depending on the option that we decant it comes to managing the hostel,
we have the option to comply or not comply with those rules. For now it is not
our intention. So FleurAngel Yurta Camp management is different from the rules
of accommodation of the Castilla and Leon.

Agua, luz y calefacción: Esta claro que una parcela urbana cuenta con
todos los servicios, abastecimiento de agua, luz, gas, telefono e internet,
pero en este caso nuestro proyecto solo precisa de electricidad (procuraremos
ser autosuficientes también en este aspecto), y a lo sumo, abastecimiento de
agua (a la que trataremos para evitar el cloro). Si optamos por una parcela
rústica, no tendremos abastecimiento en la parcela, pero incorporaremos
generadores de electricidad si fuera preciso el uso de electricidad, y
utilizaremos depósitos de agua que reutilizaremos y potabilizaremos.
Water, electricity and heating: It is
clear that an urban place has all services, water, electricity, gas, telephone
and internet, but in this case our project only needs electricity (also we want
to be self-sufficient in this regard) and at most, water (whithout chlorate).
If we choose a rustic plot, we have no supply in the place, but incorporate
generators if is necessary the use of electricity and use water tanks without
chlorate.
Construir yurtas, aseos, etc.: El montaje de las Yurtas es algo muy sencillo,
se requiere una pequeña instalación para el aseo o la cocina, una base de
madera, sobre la que se monta la tienda, en aproximadamente dos dias. Lo mismo
para el desmontaje.
Build yurts, toilets, etc.: The work to
build this yurts is very easy. An small tubes for toilet or kitchen, a wooden
base on which the structure is mounted, in about two days is finish. Same for
dismantling.
En definitiva, somos expertos en encontrar soluciones sencillas y
eficientes en todas las situaciones que se nos presentan, por tanto no tememos
encontrar nuevos retos en este proyecto.
In short, we are experts at finding
simple and efficient solutions in every situation we find, so we are not afraid
to find new challenges in this project.

                      ¿Recompensas por la ayuda?-¿Rewards for help?: ""Una llave para nuestro/su
nuevo hogar y muchas sorpresas”-""A key to our/their new home
and many surprises.""

 A todos aquellos que nos ayuden en nuestro proyecto queremos ofrecerles,
independientemente de las recompensas que ofrezcamos en cada momento, una llavecita, como símbolo que representa
la solución de todos los problemas, que podéis utilizar como queráis (pedirnos
ayuda cuando la necesitéis, regalársela a otra persona,etc. es vuestra!), y
como símbolo de dueños que sois de esta casa, como co-propietarios de FleurAngel Yurta Camp. Esta es desde ese momento vuestra casa.
Tenéis una casa para ir de vacaciones cuando queráis!!!. 
To all those who help us in our project
we want to offer, regardless of the rewards they offer at all times, a small
key, a symbol representing the solution of all problem, and a symbol for co-owners
of FleurAngel Yurta Camp. This is from this time your house. You have a home to
go on holidays when you want!!!.

<p>My name is Neil Hatherall. I am the founder of Goatmeal Breakfast Cereal. Please! Have a seat! I'd like to tell you a little bit about how Goatmeal came to be.</p>
<p>About 15 years ago I began suffering from health issues that gradually worsened as I got older. These issues included allergic reactions, food sensitivities, digestive disorders, stomach pains and cramps, heart palpitations, anxiety, and even depression.</p>
<p>I believed at the time that these were all symptoms of a serious underlying health problem. So being young, naive, and scared, I thought I was dying . . .</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After many unsuccessful trips to the doctor, I took matters into my own hands and eventually started putting two and two together. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<b><div style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""background-color: initial;"">“My body does not like something I’m eating!”</b></div></b><p>
</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the present day - I’ve spent the last 6 years researching health and nutrition while using my own body as a test subject. And I'm extremely happy to say that I’ve finally figured out the major cause of all of these unexplained symptoms . . .</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439844234/kdjpgm2gmb4akul9wg6u.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 624.908256880734px; height: 285px;""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Since predominantly cutting these three things out of my diet, I now rarely experience any of the health issues I used to! </p>
<p></p>
<b><div style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""background-color: initial;""><h2>Now I feel amazing!</h2></b></div></b><p>
</p>
<p>So why the tear jerking story? </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Well, I’m an entrepreneur at heart. And earlier this year I decided that I wanted to create a food product that essentially encompassed my journey through health and nutrition.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And so Goatmeal began . . .</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439851161/vym5wsmgbt8gk4piai8i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Goatmeal Superfood Breakfast Cereal is best described as a grain-free porridge. Unlike regular porridge (oatmeal), Goatmeal does not need to be cooked; It can be prepared quickly and easily by simply adding hot or cold milk or water then left to rest for as little as <strong>3 minutes</strong>. That's right! You can eat it hot, or cold!<br/></p>
<p>Although Goatmeal is a breakfast cereal, it is very versatile. It can also be added to other cereals, smoothies, yogurt, baking recipes, sprinkled on top of food such as salads and ice-cream, and it can even be eaten raw out of the package as a healthy snack.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Goatmeal is formulated to help the amazing human body function as it should!</b></p>

<h3>So why Goatmeal and not other cereals?</h3>
<p>Most cereals on the market today are made of grains (wheat, oats, corn, rice, etc..), making them very processed, high in carbohydrates and sugar, and low in most of everything else.<b> </b>(To learn more about the negative effects of grains on your health, be sure to check chapter #7 on this page)f</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Goatmeal is a different approach to breakfast cereal.</b> It is:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Grain-free</b></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Much lower in carbohydrates</b></span></li>
<li>
<b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Higher in healthy fats and protein</span>

</h3>
</div>
<p>Goatmeal is made of 100% organic ingredients! We have experimented with countless recipes to find the most nutritious and best tasting base-mixture of some of the following super-foods:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0809/7135/files/Goatmeal-ingredients.jpg?332734768421237093"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p>We've been demonstrating and selling Goatmeal for almost 4 months at local farmer's markets. <br/></p>
<p>Faster than we had ever expected, we've received a great community response, built a solid customer base, established amazing business connections, and realized we really do have something special here. </p>
<p>We now have the opportunity to work with a distribution company and get our products on many grocery store shelves. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Nows our chance to turn Goatmeal into a legitimate food manufacturing company. </b></p>
<p>That means we need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Abide by packaging and labeling laws and regulations</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Rent bigger, more functional commercial kitchen space and storage</span></li>
<li>Manufacture large amounts of inventory to fill store orders</li>
<li>Purchase better equipment to manufacture our product faster</li>
<li>Buy new shoes (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439851375/qgrmrmuvsgae50mt4sut.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 629.538461538462px; height: 132px;""/></p>
<p>We believe crowdfunding is a revolutionary way to raise money. Here's why:</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It is a great way to </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">build a network of like minded people that can all easily contribute smaller amounts to together make something big happen.</b><br/>
</li>
<li>It makes bringing a creative idea to life easier for anyone to do - rather than traditional financing options such as:</li>
</ol>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>High-interest bank loans</b> — which aren't easy for everyone to be approved for nor are they easy to pay back. Plus you're just helping banks, which already have boatloads of money, make more money.</li>
<li>
<b>Investors</b> — which you need to give up a percentage of equity in exchange for the funds. </li>
<li>
<b>Government grants</b> — which are very difficult to get, they take a long time to actually receive funds, and not everyone is eligible.</li>
</ul>We are extremely grateful to live in a time where crowdfunding is an option.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440195514/cmrtolivcg6dz0yj4dux.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This money will be put towards:</p>
<p><b>ORGANIC CERTIFICATION</b></p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the packaging laws - in a nutshell - foods labelled as being ""Organic"" must be ""Certified Organic"". This process to be certified is lengthy, and expensive. Although all our ingredients are certified organic, we need the certify our product as a whole to legally label it as organic.</p>
<p><b>Annoying Legal Fees</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Business License and registration</li>
<li>Trademark</li>
<li>Liability Insurance</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><b>Product Development</b></p>
<p>We are designing a new and improved brand and package for our product. It will be mind blowing needless-to-say.</p>
<p>We will also be experimenting and releasing a new unique flavour to add more variety.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Inventory</b></p>
<p>We have found a supplier that has a very large minimum order size for all of our ingredients. This means we will be able to get our ingredients much cheaper and that will impact the overall price of our products. This also means we need a lot more money to invest. (Hint: the minimum order lbs weight is in the triple digits)</p>
<p>We also are going to need a lot more inventory to fill our first orders.</p>
</div>
<p><b><b>Manufacturing Costs</b><br/></b></p>
<p>To start manufacturing large quantities we need to make our process as fast and efficient as possible. This will require:</p>
<p></p>
<li>Better Equipment<br/>
</li>
<li>Commercial kitchen and storage space rentals</li>
<p></p>
<p><b>Promotion</b><br/></p>
<p>It takes a lot of work promoting a new food product - Especially since there is so many food products out there to compete with. Although our product is quite unique and has a great brand, it will still take some funds to put towards things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Advertising</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Trade shows</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Brand Ambassadors</span></li>

<p></p>
<h4><strong>Q) SO WHY DO YOU CALL IT GOATMEAL?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>A)</strong> The name ""Goatmeal"" originates from the idea that our breakfast cereal is like a grain-free version of oatmeal<strong><em>. </em></strong>We literally took the word ""Oatmeal"" and stuck a ""G"" in front of it - The ""G"" stands for ""Grainless"" or ""Grain-free"".</p>
<p>Aside from that, the name has no meaning what-so-ever; except to be memorable.</p>
<h4><strong>Q) IS THERE GROUND UP GOATS IN GOATMEAL?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>A)</strong> There are no goats, or any kind of goat related ingredients in Goatmeal. ""Goatmeal"" is entirely just a funny name.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Q) IS GOATMEAL HIGH IN CALORIES?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>A)</strong> Although the number of calories per serving of Goatmeal may appear high, the source of these calories has a far greater impact on your weight and health than the overall number. </p>
<p>For example, Fructose is isocaloric, but not isometabolic. This means you can have the same amount of calories from fructose as glucose, fructose and protein, or fructose and fat, but the<em>metabolic effect will be entirely different despite the identical calorie count</em>.</p>
<p>It's really important to understand that all calories CANNOT be treated the same—especially if you're struggling with excess weight and/or health issues!</p>
<p>All ingredients in Goatmeal are extremely high quality, packed full of vitamins and minerals, and are 100% certified organic.</p>
<p><strong>It's far more important to look at the source of the calories than counting them.</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, we hope you've enjoyed everything you've watched, seen, read, heard and smelled about Goatmeal.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Neil Hatherall. I am the founder of Goatmeal Breakfast Cereal. Please! Have a seat! I'd like to tell you a little bit about how Goatmeal came to be.
About 15 years ago I began suffering from health issues that gradually worsened as I got older. These issues included allergic reactions, food sensitivities, digestive disorders, stomach pains and cramps, heart palpitations, anxiety, and even depression.
I believed at the time that these were all symptoms of a serious underlying health problem. So being young, naive, and scared, I thought I was dying . . .


After many unsuccessful trips to the doctor, I took matters into my own hands and eventually started putting two and two together. 



“My body does not like something I’m eating!”

Fast-forward to the present day - I’ve spent the last 6 years researching health and nutrition while using my own body as a test subject. And I'm extremely happy to say that I’ve finally figured out the major cause of all of these unexplained symptoms . . .







Since predominantly cutting these three things out of my diet, I now rarely experience any of the health issues I used to! 

Now I feel amazing!

So why the tear jerking story? 


Well, I’m an entrepreneur at heart. And earlier this year I decided that I wanted to create a food product that essentially encompassed my journey through health and nutrition.




And so Goatmeal began . . .



Goatmeal Superfood Breakfast Cereal is best described as a grain-free porridge. Unlike regular porridge (oatmeal), Goatmeal does not need to be cooked; It can be prepared quickly and easily by simply adding hot or cold milk or water then left to rest for as little as 3 minutes. That's right! You can eat it hot, or cold!
Although Goatmeal is a breakfast cereal, it is very versatile. It can also be added to other cereals, smoothies, yogurt, baking recipes, sprinkled on top of food such as salads and ice-cream, and it can even be eaten raw out of the package as a healthy snack.


Goatmeal is formulated to help the amazing human body function as it should!
 It's also perfectly suited for the following common diets:


Gluten-Free — For celiacs, those who are sensitive to gluten, or people that simply want to cut it out for other reasons.

Grain-Free — For people who believe eating grains is actually putting us at a higher risk of disease.

Organic — A diet free of synthetic additives like pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and dyes, and foods not processed using industrial solvents, irradiation, or genetic engineering.

Non-GMO — GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism. This diet is for those who do not eat genetically modified foods.

Paleo — A diet based on types of food presumed to have been eaten by early humans including meat, vegetables and fruit, excluding dairy, grains, and processed foods.

Low-Carb / Low Sugar — For those following the Atkins diet and other low-carbohydrate diets. There is no added sugar or sweetener in Goatmeal.

Diabetic — For those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Vegan / Vegetarian — For animal-friendly eaters. Goatmeal does not contain any animal bi-products (not even goats).

Lactose-Intolerant — For those with an intolerance to dairy products. Goatmeal is lactose-free.

Low Sodium — For people trying to decrease their salt intake for medical reasons such as high blood pressure. There is no added salt in Goatmeal.

So why Goatmeal and not other cereals?
Most cereals on the market today are made of grains (wheat, oats, corn, rice, etc..), making them very processed, high in carbohydrates and sugar, and low in most of everything else. (To learn more about the negative effects of grains on your health, be sure to check chapter #7 on this page)f

Goatmeal is a different approach to breakfast cereal. It is:


Grain-free
Much lower in carbohydrates

Higher in healthy fats and protein



Full of naturally occurring vitamins and minerals









What IS in Goatmeal? 


Goatmeal is made of 100% organic ingredients! We have experimented with countless recipes to find the most nutritious and best tasting base-mixture of some of the following super-foods:






We've been demonstrating and selling Goatmeal for almost 4 months at local farmer's markets. 
Faster than we had ever expected, we've received a great community response, built a solid customer base, established amazing business connections, and realized we really do have something special here. 
We now have the opportunity to work with a distribution company and get our products on many grocery store shelves. 

Nows our chance to turn Goatmeal into a legitimate food manufacturing company. 
That means we need to:

Abide by packaging and labeling laws and regulations
Rent bigger, more functional commercial kitchen space and storage
Manufacture large amounts of inventory to fill store orders
Purchase better equipment to manufacture our product faster
Buy new shoes (optional)




We believe crowdfunding is a revolutionary way to raise money. Here's why:



It is a great way to build a network of like minded people that can all easily contribute smaller amounts to together make something big happen.

It makes bringing a creative idea to life easier for anyone to do - rather than traditional financing options such as:




High-interest bank loans — which aren't easy for everyone to be approved for nor are they easy to pay back. Plus you're just helping banks, which already have boatloads of money, make more money.

Investors — which you need to give up a percentage of equity in exchange for the funds. 

Government grants — which are very difficult to get, they take a long time to actually receive funds, and not everyone is eligible.
We are extremely grateful to live in a time where crowdfunding is an option.



This money will be put towards:
ORGANIC CERTIFICATION
If you are unfamiliar with the packaging laws - in a nutshell - foods labelled as being ""Organic"" must be ""Certified Organic"". This process to be certified is lengthy, and expensive. Although all our ingredients are certified organic, we need the certify our product as a whole to legally label it as organic.
Annoying Legal Fees

Business License and registration
Trademark
Liability Insurance


Product Development
We are designing a new and improved brand and package for our product. It will be mind blowing needless-to-say.
We will also be experimenting and releasing a new unique flavour to add more variety.

Inventory
We have found a supplier that has a very large minimum order size for all of our ingredients. This means we will be able to get our ingredients much cheaper and that will impact the overall price of our products. This also means we need a lot more money to invest. (Hint: the minimum order lbs weight is in the triple digits)
We also are going to need a lot more inventory to fill our first orders.

Manufacturing Costs
To start manufacturing large quantities we need to make our process as fast and efficient as possible. This will require:

Better Equipment

Commercial kitchen and storage space rentals

Promotion
It takes a lot of work promoting a new food product - Especially since there is so many food products out there to compete with. Although our product is quite unique and has a great brand, it will still take some funds to put towards things such as:

Advertising
Trade shows
Brand Ambassadors

<h3>Our Technology</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>This natural medicine technology
platform is based upon the Modified Polyphenol Technology patent (pending -
PCT/WO 2014055463 A1). The Modified Polyphenol patent (pending) describes aged
oak technology as its impacts on ageing related conditions.</p>
<p>Oak is used traditionally
for the symptomatic relief and management of arthritis, rheumatism and <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">osteoarthritic pain. This
is due to a polyphenol group called ellagitannins and are found in the oak
timber (heartwood). As with other polyphenol rich foods (e.g. tea, coffee and
wine), these generally have small effects on the body as these molecules find
it difficult to move from the intestines to the cells.</span></p>
<p>Dr Red extract and age these
oak ellagitannins and make them more available to the cells, profoundly
increasing their effectiveness.</p>

</p>
<p>We are an aging population, not just Australia but globally. As we age, we are confronted with a range of health issues that are associated with uncontrolled inflammation in our bodies. The most obvious is pain.</p>
<p>One
in five (52.5 million) adults in the United States report having

</div></div>","Polypill and Oak Aged Licorice works
a treat for pain and gout 


A
world without pain? Every medical
discovery has the potential to affect us all, to save or improve our own lives,
or those of people we love.
300 million people suffer from daily pain. There is a need for safe,
natural treatments with pharmaceutical potency.
Over the last 14 years, Dr Red scientists have developed antioxidant-rich foods that impact on aging-related conditions. This current medical breakthrough centers on a patent (pending) oak extract that outperformed aspirin and ibuprofen in arthritis trials. An absolute world first!




The aged oak extract formulations, Polypill Joint Capsules and the Oak Aged Licorice deliver pain relief in  1 – 4 days and gout results overnight.
My name is Greg Jardine, an Australian Biochemist who has patented a process for the oak aged foods and supplements, resulting in better absorption in our bodies and allowing them to reach their full potential. 
Professor Lindsay Brown (University of Southern Queensland) was astounded when oak aged foods outperformed aspirin and ibuprofen in arthritis trials. The uric acid reduction results associated with gout were equally impressive.

How does it work?






Our Technology


This natural medicine technology
platform is based upon the Modified Polyphenol Technology patent (pending -
PCT/WO 2014055463 A1). The Modified Polyphenol patent (pending) describes aged
oak technology as its impacts on ageing related conditions.
Oak is used traditionally
for the symptomatic relief and management of arthritis, rheumatism and osteoarthritic pain. This
is due to a polyphenol group called ellagitannins and are found in the oak
timber (heartwood). As with other polyphenol rich foods (e.g. tea, coffee and
wine), these generally have small effects on the body as these molecules find
it difficult to move from the intestines to the cells.
Dr Red extract and age these
oak ellagitannins and make them more available to the cells, profoundly
increasing their effectiveness.

Polypill Joint Capsules - TGA Listed Medicine






Dr Red Oak Aged Licorice - Product description
Dr Red Oak Aged Licorice is based on a polyphenol rich licorice
that is fortified with the patent (pending) Aged French Oak Extract.
It's the combination that works!
Licorice is a food that is high in polyphenols, most notably
from the licorice root, aniseed and molasses.




What we're funding

This campaign aims to sell the Polypill Joint Capsules and the new Oak Aged Licorice to international customers.
The proceeds of these sales (up to USD15,300) will be used to provide matching funds (50:50) for an Australian Government Food Innovation grant awarded to Dr Red to develop licorice and natural medicine products that target pain and urinary tract infections.


The Impact

 

We are an aging population, not just Australia but globally. As we age, we are confronted with a range of health issues that are associated with uncontrolled inflammation in our bodies. The most obvious is pain.
One
in five (52.5 million) adults in the United States report having
doctor-diagnosed arthritis. In Australia the number is
about 4 million people.
Dr Red Oak Aged Licorice has just hit the shelves of Australian
Pharmacies and Health Food stores.
THIS CAMPAIGN offers this licorice up to a global audience in need of
rapid pain relief. Proceeds  from existing  product sales is used to launch a pill –

depend on me and lives to touch. Breast Cancer cannot take all of that from me.
I don’t want it to. It has taken enough. My boss fired me immediately after my

In order to plant a vineyard, we need- 3000 grapvines- already purchased!!- 12,000 feet of landscape fabric and 6,000 staples to hold the fabric down- fertilizer-3000 pieces of rebar Why we are doing thisWe know that we are blessed to have 4 acres of grapes that produce high quality North Carolina wine. However, right now, we are not operating at full capacity. If we are able to plant more acres of vines, we will be able to operate more efficiently. We will then be able to support hiring a person to manage the sales and marketing of the wine, as well as a person to manage the vineyard.Also, we would like to improve our market mix. Growing Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot will allow us to produce even better wine than we do now. We will be able to blend in a few grapes with the Chambourcin to make it more complex. Depending on how the grapes turn out, we might make a Cab Franc blend, with the Petit Verdot, or make two new stand-along wines. With the new Villard blanc planting, we hope to do a late harvest wine, something similar to a Sauternes.Risks and ChallengesAs with anything in agriculture, the weather, pests, and other acts of God can easily wipe out a crop or a planting. Nevertheless, we have researched these varieties extensively and after working with them at other vineyards, we are confident that we can produce some great Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Villard blanc.Other ways you can helpPlanting this vineyard is not simply about raising the money! We will also need help putting the vines in the ground! If you're interested in joining us for planting, the vines will begin to arrive April 6th and we will need all the help we can get.

</h1><h1>
</h1><hr/>
<p>We developed HawQ-i to help drivers be able to see pedestrians, motorcyclists &amp; bicyclists out on the road.  With the increasing number of people using alternate methods for commuting, the roads are more crowded than ever.  We knew that there was a need to reduce the number of collisions, deaths, and injuries by providing additional information to drivers to make them aware before an accident occurs.</p><p>Our founders are road cyclists who had friends who were seriously hurt in collisions that might have been avoided if HawQ-i were available. The increase in the number of deaths and Ghost 
Bikes along our typical biking routes didn't help ease our fears.<br/></p><p>As our CEO was out biking 
on a beautiful sunny California day, he had a thought...what if you 
could utilize readily available electronic sensors within products like a
 cell phone or fitness tracker,  for example, to alert a driver that a 
pedestrian, motorcycle, or a bicyclist was near so that you could 
prevent a collision...and save a life?   <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467951120/crosswalk_dyrspn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>That bike ride was the genesis 
of HawQ-i a Sense and Avoid technology innovation for assisting drivers 
in detecting people in the vicinity (biking, walking, running, etc).</b></p><h1><b>An Advanced Warning Device<br/></b></h1><p><b>We
 realized that the major issue for drivers is the inability to ""see"" 
bicyclists, motorcyclists, and pedestrians and that <i>most accidents are 
avoidable if the driver has advanced notice.</i> </b> We believed that if we 
could improve the ability for drivers to react that we could provide a 
viable solution.  So HawQ-i aids the driver by alerting them to the 
presence of people who might be in their path.</p><br/><h2 align=""center""><i><b>Why is HawQ-i important to us?</b></i></h2><p><br/></p><p>Because
 safer roads impact us all!  We are seeking to reduce the number of 
deaths and injuries keep rising from vehicle collisions with people in 
the road.  Just take a look at that the numbers....the US in 2013 there 
were:</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Every year 10,000 People are killed in collisions with vehicles-10X more killed by vehicles than guns!<br/></b></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>31% of all vehicle-related fatalities are other than the vehicle driver or occupants</b></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>200,000 injuries occur as a result of accidents between bicyclists, motorcyclist and pedestrians</b></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>$4 Billion is lost in property and life due to vehicle-related collisions with bicycles</b></li></ul>We desperately need a solution to reduce accidents that 
don't have to happen.  <br/><h2></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467949994/Ghost_Bike_updated_icz11k.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>That's why we developed HawQ-i and that's why we

<i>available low power sensors that are in many of today’s fitness
products (ANT+/BLE) and today's Smartphones (BLE).  </i><b>HawQ-i Sense &amp; Avoid provides drivers with alerts or reminders</b><i><b> allowing the driver and road conditions to dictate appropriate action or actions.</b> <br/><br/></i></b><h3>

<br/>
<b>1.  HawQ-i Sense Device:
</b><p>Sense is a portable, low-power device (2.25""X2.25""X.50"") that 
easily attaches to your vehicle's visor.  Sense continuously scans for 
ANT+ and/or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors.         
</p>
<p><b>2.Sensors </b>
</p>
<p>Sense rapidly processes the received sensor signals  (faster than the
 blink of an eye) and provides the driver with both a visual and audio 
alert.  
</p>
<p>HawQ-i Sense contains all of the electronic circuitry including 
the 
antenna and is housed in an attractive injection-molded case (shown here
 in gun-metal gray, but also available in royal blue and burgundy). All 
sensors contain communication protocol that can be detected by devices 
(receivers) that understand that protocol.  
</p>
<p><b>3. Action</b></p>
<p>Once detected, Sense alerts the driver to the presence of bicyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians via HawQ-i's alerts.
</p>
<p><b>4. Outcome</b>  
</p>
<p>The driver is able to make necessary adjustments, an accident is 
</p>
<p>avoided and a LIFE SAVED!</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions




</h1>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Q: I've seen cars that are equipped with a camera or radar to 
detect the presence of people in the road.  Does HawQ-i use these 
technologies?</b><br/></p>
<p>A:  No, the sensor system we have developed doesn't use radar or 
cameras.  HawQ-i uses sensors that emit a signal and can be detected by 
our hardware/software.  The advantage of HawQ-i is that it can be 
effectively used outside the range of cameras and radar where there is 
low visibility.  
</p>
<p><b>Q: What if my vehicle already has a back-up camera.  Would HawQ-i Sense be valuable? </b></p>
<p>A: Even if you have a backup camera in your vehicle, HawQ-i Sense provides additional support.  Back-up cameras can see directly behind the vehicle, whereas HawQ-i Sense can detect people out of visual range.   In fact the strength of HawQ-i is the ability to help you ""see"" beyond the field of view. </p>
<p><b>Q: What is the warranty period for HawQ-i? </b><br/></p>A:  The warranty is a full one year warranty.  The first 30 days is a full replacement for defective units. <br/><br/><p><b>Q: How long can HawQ-i last before it needs to be recharge?</b></p>A:  The 3.3v battery is fully rechargeable with a typical battery life of over 8 hours of driving time. <br/><br/><b>Q: How can I be detected by HawQ-i Sense?  What devices have sensors that can be detected?</b><br/><br/>A:
 Any ANT+ device can be detected by HawQ-i Sense.  There are over 800 
products that contain ANT+ sensors and these include:  fitness trackers,
 bike cadence/speed sensors, bike lights, cameras, heart rate monitors, 
etc.  For ANT+ products, click on the link <a href=""http://www.thisisant.com/directory"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thisisant.com/directory</a>.  </div>
<div>There are numerous Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) products available 
in the market but the most prevalent are in Smart phones.   We recommend 
utilizing our HawQ-i Alert app for use with a Smartphone.   We have included several types of BLE devices that are detectable by HawQ-i.  There are numerous manufacturers of BLE beacons that can be utilized in place of HawQ-i Pulse. </div>
<div>One of the values of this ecosystem is that numerous products are available that can be detected making it faster for adoption and growth.<br/><br/><b>Q:  Do I need to purchase HawQ-i Pulse to be detected?<br/><br/></b>A: 
 No you would not need purchase HawQ-i Pulse if  you already have ANT+ 
or BLE products which are detectable.   HawQ-i Pulse will include

</div></div>","Why Did We Develop HawQ-i?


We developed HawQ-i to help drivers be able to see pedestrians, motorcyclists & bicyclists out on the road.  With the increasing number of people using alternate methods for commuting, the roads are more crowded than ever.  We knew that there was a need to reduce the number of collisions, deaths, and injuries by providing additional information to drivers to make them aware before an accident occurs.Our founders are road cyclists who had friends who were seriously hurt in collisions that might have been avoided if HawQ-i were available. The increase in the number of deaths and Ghost 
Bikes along our typical biking routes didn't help ease our fears.As our CEO was out biking 
on a beautiful sunny California day, he had a thought...what if you 
could utilize readily available electronic sensors within products like a
 cell phone or fitness tracker,  for example, to alert a driver that a 
pedestrian, motorcycle, or a bicyclist was near so that you could 
prevent a collision...and save a life?   That bike ride was the genesis 
of HawQ-i a Sense and Avoid technology innovation for assisting drivers 
in detecting people in the vicinity (biking, walking, running, etc).An Advanced Warning DeviceWe
 realized that the major issue for drivers is the inability to ""see"" 
bicyclists, motorcyclists, and pedestrians and that most accidents are 
avoidable if the driver has advanced notice.  We believed that if we 
could improve the ability for drivers to react that we could provide a 
viable solution.  So HawQ-i aids the driver by alerting them to the 
presence of people who might be in their path.Why is HawQ-i important to us?Because
 safer roads impact us all!  We are seeking to reduce the number of 
deaths and injuries keep rising from vehicle collisions with people in 
the road.  Just take a look at that the numbers....the US in 2013 there 
were:Every year 10,000 People are killed in collisions with vehicles-10X more killed by vehicles than guns!
31% of all vehicle-related fatalities are other than the vehicle driver or occupants
200,000 injuries occur as a result of accidents between bicyclists, motorcyclist and pedestrians
$4 Billion is lost in property and life due to vehicle-related collisions with bicyclesWe desperately need a solution to reduce accidents that 
don't have to happen.  That's why we developed HawQ-i and that's why we 
need your support! HawQ-i is more than just a cool tech product...it's a
 life-saver!  Join us in supporting our HawQ-i product and building a 
community that protects people commuting, working out, going to school 
and makes the roads a safer place for all! For just a small funding amount you can help to improve lives for millions of people who commute and share roads with vehicles.HawQ-i Sense & Avoid Technology



 What makes this technology unique?  Today there are no products that are able to do what HawQ-i Sense can.  There are camera-based solutions in vehicles today that are extremely effective for backing-up or when people are directly in front of the vehicle.  However HawQ-i Sense operates for situations not covered by camera-only solutions.  Instead, our technology can augment camera systems and is able to detect sensors within 360 degree radius of the device.  The majority of technology focus is on safety solutions that automate decision-making.   Instead HawQ-i alerts drivers to the presence of people in or near the road before an accident occurs via detection of
available low power sensors that are in many of today’s fitness
products (ANT+/BLE) and today's Smartphones (BLE).  HawQ-i Sense & Avoid provides drivers with alerts or reminders allowing the driver and road conditions to dictate appropriate action or actions. 
HawQ-i Sense does not automate driving, rather it provides additional information so that a driver can take the appropriate action. 


How HawQ-i System Works



1.  HawQ-i Sense Device:
Sense is a portable, low-power device (2.25""X2.25""X.50"") that 
easily attaches to your vehicle's visor.  Sense continuously scans for 
ANT+ and/or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors.         

2.Sensors 

Sense rapidly processes the received sensor signals  (faster than the
 blink of an eye) and provides the driver with both a visual and audio 
alert.  

HawQ-i Sense contains all of the electronic circuitry including 
the 
antenna and is housed in an attractive injection-molded case (shown here
 in gun-metal gray, but also available in royal blue and burgundy). All 
sensors contain communication protocol that can be detected by devices 
(receivers) that understand that protocol.  

3. Action
Once detected, Sense alerts the driver to the presence of bicyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians via HawQ-i's alerts.

4. Outcome  

The driver is able to make necessary adjustments, an accident is 

avoided and a LIFE SAVED!
Products

We have developed the HawQ-i
product family of low power IoT devices that enable collision
avoidance for personal and business use.
This
family includes three products:  HawQ-i
Sense, HawQ-i Pulse and our Beacon Smartphone App.


HawQ-i Sense
HawQ-i
 Sense & Avoid is the only product available today that detects 
multiple signals (not just BLE) and alerts the driver or operator!  For less than the cost of your insurance deductible Sense can assist you in avoiding collisions and making the roads safer!
A comprehensive solution detecting BLE, ANT+ & Pulse Sensors.  
Environmentally-friendly low-power and rechargeable devices. 
Always available 2.4Ghz network that does not need cellular coverage.  

Works with over 250 Million ANT+ & 1 Billion BLE products sold.  
HawQ-i Pulse

HawQ-i
 Pulse is our companion product that can be detected by HawQ-i Sense. It
 is a personal sensor solution containing detectable sensors.  It is a 
great solution for business/pleasure, for commuting, and can be utilized
 for bicyclists, motorcyclists, and people, children, pets, and the 
elderly.


Pulse (when paired with a GPS-enabled Smartphone or GPS-enabled 
Pulse) can transmit distance to the driver; helping the driver better to
 avoid people near or in the road.  
Additionally Pulse can be used as a theft deterrent as the device 
can alert the owner to movement (attached to person, bicycle, backpack, 
purse, stroller, wheelchair, etc.) 
Rechargeable Low Energy Device with USB connector for recharging




Detectable Sensors
HawQ-i Sense is able to simultaneously detect ANT+ and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors/phones*. 
These sensors include the following:
ANT+ Fitness Sensors (Garmin VivoSmartHR, Edge, etc.)

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors in Fitness Sensors (BLE 4.0=Fitbit, Jawbone, Garmin Activity Trackers


Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled Android and iPhones


*These products are detectable in Broadcast Mode (Please check your 
device manual for steps to ensure the device supports broadcast mode for
 BLE/ANT+).  For BLE solutions, any BLE, Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth 4.0 or Bluetooth Smart products are compatible.
For more information on ANT+ devices go to: 
 http://www.thisisant.com/directory/  

HawQ-i is: 


Ideal
for locations with poor visibility (heavy
traffic, low light, etc.)

Perfect
for detection even at
moving at high speeds


Uses
sensors already available today in
fitness equipment & activity trackers (ANT+, Bluetooth Low
Energy & Custom Sensors)! Yeah!

Great
for vehicle &
equipment operators

<p>     Take Alzheimer's for example, the Alzheimer's Association says treating dementia in 2014 cost the U.S. $226 billion, of which $153 billion was the cost to Medicare and Medicaid alone. Additionally, in 2014, the 15.7 million unpaid caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias provided an estimated 17.9 bilion hours of unpaid care, a contribution to the nation valued at $217.7 billion.</p>

<p>     My name is Beth Wright. I am the Founder &amp; CEO of Translational Education LLC, inventor of the opusomni ecosystem, and product visionary about how we reinvent healthcare. This is my life's work. <br/></p>
<p>     I am an occupational therapist who has practiced for 24 years and treated patients across the continuum of care including acute care, acute rehab, skilled nursing rehab, long term care, home health, hospice, outpatient rehab, independent living, assisted living, acute psychiatric care, psychiatric day treatment, pediatric school system, and pediatric outpatient rehab. <br/></p>
<p>     I understand what's broken. I want to fix it. I need your help.<br/></p>
<p>     Let's run through a couple of other examples, quickly now.</p>
<p>     Did you know, what's the number one reason for leg amputations in America? Diabetes. Foot inspections and good diabetic foot care can reduce the risk of people losing a leg. Yet, today, across the continuum of care, from acute care through rehab to home health, I rarely see an occupational therapist, a physical therapist, a doctor, or a nurse teach a person the daily life habits they need to know to prevent them from losing their leg. We have the power to fix this. We have the power to connect to people with Diabetes through their mobile devices to teach them daily habits to reduce their risk of losing a leg. We have the power to connect them to other people struggling with Diabetes to help them stay motivated and share what works for them. We have the power to create collective wisdom.<br/></p>
<p>     Now, shifting gears quickly. Did you know, what's the number one reason people 65 and older go to the emergency room? Falls. That's right. Yet again, today, across the continuum of care, from acute care through rehab 
to home health, I rarely see an occupational therapist, a physical 
therapist, a doctor, or a nurse teach a person the daily habits 
they need to know to prevent them from falling. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the NIH (National Institutes of Health) have lots of data to show that falls are largely preventable, with the right strategies. But, these strategies rarely reach people who need them today. We have the power to connect to people who are at risk for falls through their mobile devices to teach them daily habits and ways to modify their homes and tasks to reduce their risk of falling. We have the power to connect them with other people who are at risk of falling to help them stay motivated and share what works for them. We have the power to create collective wisdom.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>     Have you ever met anyone who went to school and acquired a bunch of book knowledge, and then went out and tried to apply what they had learned in the real world?</p>
<p>     This is the problem opusomni is designed to solve.</p>
<p>     Opusomni translates book knowledge into lived experience so people perform education, work, and health management tasks better. <br/></p>
<p>     Opusomni is an evidence-based approach, rooted in a broad body of evidence in the life sciences and propounded in my meta-theory, Translational Education, about what factors drive performance achievement in authentic environments.</p>
<p>     Opusomni is easy to use. Opusomni takes this broad body of evidence, that is difficult to understand and perhaps more difficult to apply, and turns it into a Heuristic...something that is so easy to do; a daily life habit--to drive performance achievement and make life better. Learners do three simple things every week and life gets better! Learners set, save, and share.</p>
<p>     Opusomni is a patented system, U.S. 8,628,331, with 98 claims, 
under twelve (12) U.S. Classifications. A U.S. Continuation Application, U.S. 2014/0106318, the 
""first child"" of the issued U.S. ""parent patent"" U.S. 8,628,331, is

</div></div>","Short Summary      Did you know that 75% of all healthcare costs go to manage chronic diseases? Yes, that's right. Yet today, we have no way to manage chronic diseases where people live their everyday lives. 
     Ateko, the healthcare vertical of opusomni, is designed to help you manage chronic diseases where you live your everyday life through your mobile device. Ateko picks up where healthcare leaves off to help you manage your health and well-being in your community where you live your everyday life. 
     Healthcare is utterly broken. Our current healthcare system is utterly failing to provide the kind of care people need where they need it to make their lives better. 
     Take Alzheimer's for example, the Alzheimer's Association says treating dementia in 2014 cost the U.S. $226 billion, of which $153 billion was the cost to Medicare and Medicaid alone. Additionally, in 2014, the 15.7 million unpaid caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias provided an estimated 17.9 bilion hours of unpaid care, a contribution to the nation valued at $217.7 billion.

     Your contribution of $7,500 will put your corporate or not-for-profit Ad in the hands of ateko users. Your brand will be part of the Inaugural Contributor advertising set. Highlighted at app launch, you will be spotlighted for your help in building the ateko app and lauded for your role in adding to the Collective Wisdom. Your advertisement will be in rotation on http://ateko.co/ over the next year after the campaign ends, an estimated discount of well over 75% off our introductory ad pricing. The number of Ad Perks will be limited so contribute early or miss out. 
     Our healthcare system is utterly failing to provide these caregivers with meaningful information, resources, and connectivity to make their lives and their loved ones lives' better.
     We have the power to fix this. We have the power to make life better for caregivers and their loved ones who suffer from Alzheimer's. We also have the power to make life better for people who suffer from other chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, obesity, falls, autism, PTSD, cancer, arthritis, and others. 
     We need your help. You have the power to help make life better for people who struggle with chronic diseases. You have the power to help reinvent healthcare delivery. Your generous donations, your participation in our social network, and your shared wisdom and insights through our ateko app will help build the future for how healthcare should be delivered. It's ours to shape.
     My name is Beth Wright. I am the Founder & CEO of Translational Education LLC, inventor of the opusomni ecosystem, and product visionary about how we reinvent healthcare. This is my life's work. 
     I am an occupational therapist who has practiced for 24 years and treated patients across the continuum of care including acute care, acute rehab, skilled nursing rehab, long term care, home health, hospice, outpatient rehab, independent living, assisted living, acute psychiatric care, psychiatric day treatment, pediatric school system, and pediatric outpatient rehab. 
     I understand what's broken. I want to fix it. I need your help.
     Let's run through a couple of other examples, quickly now.
     Did you know, what's the number one reason for leg amputations in America? Diabetes. Foot inspections and good diabetic foot care can reduce the risk of people losing a leg. Yet, today, across the continuum of care, from acute care through rehab to home health, I rarely see an occupational therapist, a physical therapist, a doctor, or a nurse teach a person the daily life habits they need to know to prevent them from losing their leg. We have the power to fix this. We have the power to connect to people with Diabetes through their mobile devices to teach them daily habits to reduce their risk of losing a leg. We have the power to connect them to other people struggling with Diabetes to help them stay motivated and share what works for them. We have the power to create collective wisdom.
     Now, shifting gears quickly. Did you know, what's the number one reason people 65 and older go to the emergency room? Falls. That's right. Yet again, today, across the continuum of care, from acute care through rehab 
to home health, I rarely see an occupational therapist, a physical 
therapist, a doctor, or a nurse teach a person the daily habits 
they need to know to prevent them from falling. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the NIH (National Institutes of Health) have lots of data to show that falls are largely preventable, with the right strategies. But, these strategies rarely reach people who need them today. We have the power to connect to people who are at risk for falls through their mobile devices to teach them daily habits and ways to modify their homes and tasks to reduce their risk of falling. We have the power to connect them with other people who are at risk of falling to help them stay motivated and share what works for them. We have the power to create collective wisdom.

     A contribution of $5 will ensure that you receive a priority 
invitation to use and share ateko for a condition that affects you or 
your loved one, so you can join the Collective Wisdom. So, whether you 
or a loved one struggles with obesity, diabetes, autism, PTSD, 
cancer-aftercare or other challenges, you will be notified as soon as 
they release and offered a priority invitation as a Select Member of our
 Alpha Team. You will be the person that your friends remember for 
giving them the introduction to the ateko system. Alpha Team Member 
perks will be capped at 1,000 team members per condition so act now!

     We need your help. We need your generous donations. We need you to participate in our social network at http://ateko.co/. We need you to share your wisdom and insights as we grow our community of ateko apps to manage all the different chronic diseases. Together, we will build the future of how healthcare should be delivered.

  What We Need
 Our Donation Goals:$200,000 accelerates development time and builds a consumer App for Alzheimer's Dementia Management for Caregivers to help compile and disseminate the shared progress and results for the Alzheimer’s dementia community.$500,000 will get the team out of Beth’s living room and into an office. We might even get a coffeemaker. Collaborating in the same space, day in and day out, will rapidly accelerate our development time. $1,000,000 puts us squarely in the middle of the fight against Alzheimer’s as we develop multimedia features and robust reporting to help aid in defining best practices derived from the collective wisdom of the community.$1,200,000 allows us to establish a research platform to study and measure the efficacy of community-endorsed methods to cope with Alzheimer’s and chart new paths forward for the ateko family members now and into the future. 
  The Impact      Have you ever met anyone who went to school and acquired a bunch of book knowledge, and then went out and tried to apply what they had learned in the real world?
     This is the problem opusomni is designed to solve.
     Opusomni translates book knowledge into lived experience so people perform education, work, and health management tasks better. 
     Opusomni is an evidence-based approach, rooted in a broad body of evidence in the life sciences and propounded in my meta-theory, Translational Education, about what factors drive performance achievement in authentic environments.
     Opusomni is easy to use. Opusomni takes this broad body of evidence, that is difficult to understand and perhaps more difficult to apply, and turns it into a Heuristic...something that is so easy to do; a daily life habit--to drive performance achievement and make life better. Learners do three simple things every week and life gets better! Learners set, save, and share.
     Opusomni is a patented system, U.S. 8,628,331, with 98 claims, 
under twelve (12) U.S. Classifications. A U.S. Continuation Application, U.S. 2014/0106318, the 
""first child"" of the issued U.S. ""parent patent"" U.S. 8,628,331, is 
currently being prosecuted. The International Patent Application has been filed and published. This is the first step in 
protecting the U.S. issued patent rights internationally. The core technology of ""Set, Save, Share"" is patented.
     Opusomni is built upon a massive, elegantly designed structured data set, amenable to sophisticated quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method scientific, outcomes-based, and quasi-ethnographic research. The data set creates opportunities for best-in-class large scale studies for improving our management of chronic diseases where people live their everyday lives.

​</b><b>Our Focus and Vision</b><br/>
<span>TD Therapeutics is
focused on developing innovative therapies that merge medicine with
technology and have the potential to address the way we treat acute and
life-threatening diseases in specific patient populations.  While our
therapeutic applications have the potential to apply to a broad range of
diseases, our initial focus is cardiovascular disease, inflammatory joint
disease, infectious disease and over-the-counter vitamins, minerals and natural formulations
that would be therapeutically beneficial. Many such therapeutic areas exist
including cardiovascular and metabolic, autoimmune, respiratory, joint and
muscular disease.<br/>
<br/>
Our vision is to transform how the world approaches the treatment of acute and
life-threatening diseases by unlocking the potential of transdermal drug
delivery applications. Recognizing the complexity of our vision, we are focused
on revolutionizing the standard of care for patients by developing and
commercializing the next generation of transdermal therapeutic options. </span></p>
<p></p><p>Most
drugs are taken orally and dosage intervals may be inconvenient.  Some
drugs are partly destroyed or neutralized in the stomach, intestine or liver
before reaching the bloodstream.  Accordingly a significantly higher dose
is needed to ensure efficacy, which in turn may increase the risk of side
effects.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446739374/tkiprpbs9yo057xu0ain.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 346.667px; height: 260px;""/></p>
<p>Doctors
around the world are calling transdermal patches ""the delivery system of
the future"" because it has been discovered that a high absorption rate of
many medicines and supplements can be achieved when delivered through the skin.  The
reason for this is when medicine or supplements are delivered transdermally; they are
absorbed directly into the blood stream initially bypassing the liver, stomach
and intestine.</p>
<p>Conversely,
studies have shown when some substances are taken orally as little as 5% makes
it to the cells where they needed.  It is therefore not appropriate to
compare a dosage taken orally with that in a transdermal patch.</p><br/>

<p></p><p>Natural
Patches are manufactured in the United States in accordance with the F.D.A.'s
GMP manufacturing guidelines.</p>
<p><b><u>Directions</u></b> - Apply one patch daily
to clean, dry, smooth skin, after 24 hours replace with a new patch in a
slightly different position. Results can take up to a few days – depending upon
the chemistry of the individual.  We would recommend starting the course 3
to 4 days prior to expectancy or to use the course continually.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u><span>GlucoPatch 30 Day Supply:</span></u></b></p>
<p><b>GlucoPatch
is the new revolutionary way to take Glucosamine and Chondroitin</b>. The GlucoPatch is a
small, discrete transdermal patch that is placed on any hair free part of the
body. The GlucoPatch delivers a constant dose of Glucosamine and Chondroitin
over a 24 hour period. Scientists have shown that Glucosamine has greater
benefits when taken over the course of the day, rather than in one dose. That  is why the GlucoPatch offers a better, more
convenient way of taking Glucosamine.</p>
<p>Glucosamine
and Chondroitin are important in the function of our joints. Chondroitin helps
to form, nourish and replace Collagen, which helps make up our Cartilage. 
Glucosamine works alongside Chondroitin to help stimulate the production and
maintenance of Collagen. Together the two play an important role in cartilage
metabolism, maintenance and regulation. Adequate amounts of these two nutrients
can be crucial for our joints. Glucosamine stimulates the manufacture of
substances necessary for proper joint function and is also responsible for
joint repair.  Chondroitin helps create a rejuvenating effect on cells and
tissue and assists in joint mobility and range of motion.</p>
<p><b><u>Ingredients</u></b> - Glucosamine
Hydrochloride, Chondroitin and Cetyl Myristoleate.</p>
<p><b><u>Directions</u></b> - Simply place one
Glucosamine patch on a relatively hairless part of the body (the inner arm is
perfect). After 24 hours remove and replace with a new patch in a slightly
different position, to allow the skin to breathe (if there is any residue of
adhesive left on the skin, wash off with warm soapy water)</p>
<p><b><u><span>Slim Patch 30 Day Supply:</span></u></b></p>
<p>The
SlimPatch works by gradually releasing a blend of natural appetite
suppressants, via a patch which is placed on the body, containing ingredients
which remain effective for 24 hours. The patch can be replaced daily for an
indefinite period of time and has been proven to be extremely effective in
aiding weight loss without some of the harmful side-effects often associated
with dieting drugs. Effective, simple to use and <b>completely natural</b>,
SlimPatch contains additional nutrients to further supplement a
calorie-controlled diet, providing the body with minerals that can often be
lost through dieting. </p>
<p>Each SlimPatch works for a full 24 hours, giving the
benefit of working while you are asleep.</p>

Burns fat and has been widely researched and accepted by the UK Medicines
Control Agency (MCA) as a suitable active ingredient for oral administration in
herbal medicines, with a medical claim for the treatment of obesity.  Other ingredients are: 5-HTP, Guarana, Zinc
Pryuvate, Yerba Mate, Flaxseed Oil, Zinc Citrate, Lecithin, L-Carnitine.</p>
<p><b><u><span>Menopause Patch 30 Day Supply:</span></u></b>  </p>
<p>The
Menopause Patch is a new <b>drug free</b> product which contains plant extracts
rich in phytoestrogens – natural plant-estrogens, as opposed to hormone
supplements.</p>
<p>By
applying the patch to the skin, symptoms such as mood swings, hot flushes,
night sweats, anxiety, depression and loss of libido can all be elevated,
providing a wonderful sense of normality. Menopause patch is totally natural.
It is not a medicine, but a carefully formulated holistic application which
causes no harmful side effects and can be used as frequently as required. Many
of the natural ingredients used in Menopause Patch, such as black cohosh and
ginger, have been long associated with helping to relieve symptoms of the
menopause. The patch also contains gotu kola which helps stimulate cell growth
and oat seed for nourishing the nervous system.</p>
<p>Safe
and simple to use, each patch is effective for up to 24 hours, offering a
natural solution to help better manage symptoms of the menopause. </p>
<p><b><u>Ingredients</u></b> - Gotu Kola
(Hydrocotyle Asiatica), Damiana (Turnera Aphrodisiaca), Black Cohoch
(Cimicifuga Racemosa), Valerian (Valeriana Officinalis), Skullcap (Scutellaria
Lateriflora), Oat Seed (Avena Sativa), Ginger (Zingiber Officinale).</p>
<p><b><u>Directions</u></b> - Place one Menopause
Patch on a relatively hair free part of the body (inner arm, tummy or bottom).
After 24 hours remove and replace with a new patch in a slightly different
position to allow the skin to breathe (if there is any residue of adhesive left
on the skin, wash off with warm soapy water).</p>
<p><b><u><span>Insect Repellent Patch 10 Day
Supply:</span></u></b></p>
<p>Each
Insect Repellent Patch contains 75mg of Thiamine, a natural vitamin, this works
with the body’s own chemistry to create an invisible barrier that shields from
biting insects. The Insect Repellent Patch is ideal for holidays, fishing,
gardening, BBQ's, Picnics and all outdoor activities. We recommend use on
children over the age of 12 months. Thiamine is very hard to obtain through a
balanced diet as the cooking process destroys most of the vitamin. The body
typically needs less than 2mg of Thiamine per day for a healthy diet; excess
Thiamine is passed through the urine, breath and skin, the latter being
important. The Insect patch is a 36 hour patch.</p>

While tablets and injections have been the traditional way to
take remedies and medications, new options are becoming increasingly popular.One highly successful
alternative delivery method is the transdermal or ""through the skin"" patch. Patches can offer several
benefits, including more consistent symptom control, enhanced convenience, increased
tolerability and the potential for fewer side effects.
Transdermal
Delivery System Advantages;

Enhancing
     bioavailability through bypassing first pass
     metabolism 
Minimizing
     pharmaco-kinetic peaks and troughs
Improving
     tolerability and dosng
Reduced side effects
Smaller doses of medication
Increasing
     patient compliance
Continuous
     delivery
Factors that can affect bioavailability: the
size and type of pill/capsule, the type of inert ingredients included in the
preparation, and the crystalline properties and rates of dissolution of the
drug itself.
While
most dietary supplement pills, capsules, or powder formulas may be very good,
they simply cannot get most of their formula nutrients into your bloodstream,
which is where they must go to deliver the benefits and results you want.
With
today’s advanced time-release transdermal patches, virtually 100% of the
formula’s dosages levels are delivered directly into your bloodstream, with no
degrading stops along the way. (Stomach Acids & Liver) Better yet, with
time-release patches, one’s system can metabolize the formula nutrients more
efficiently.There are many medicines, vitamins and minerals, over-the-counter medicines and prescriptions written by your doctor that the body has trouble processing which increases the chances of side effects.Our Product Line

Natural
Patches are manufactured in the United States in accordance with the F.D.A.'s
GMP manufacturing guidelines.
Directions - Apply one patch daily
to clean, dry, smooth skin, after 24 hours replace with a new patch in a
slightly different position. Results can take up to a few days – depending upon
the chemistry of the individual.  We would recommend starting the course 3
to 4 days prior to expectancy or to use the course continually.

GlucoPatch 30 Day Supply:
GlucoPatch
is the new revolutionary way to take Glucosamine and Chondroitin. The GlucoPatch is a
small, discrete transdermal patch that is placed on any hair free part of the
body. The GlucoPatch delivers a constant dose of Glucosamine and Chondroitin
over a 24 hour period. Scientists have shown that Glucosamine has greater
benefits when taken over the course of the day, rather than in one dose. That  is why the GlucoPatch offers a better, more
convenient way of taking Glucosamine.
Glucosamine
and Chondroitin are important in the function of our joints. Chondroitin helps
to form, nourish and replace Collagen, which helps make up our Cartilage. 
Glucosamine works alongside Chondroitin to help stimulate the production and
maintenance of Collagen. Together the two play an important role in cartilage
metabolism, maintenance and regulation. Adequate amounts of these two nutrients
can be crucial for our joints. Glucosamine stimulates the manufacture of
substances necessary for proper joint function and is also responsible for
joint repair.  Chondroitin helps create a rejuvenating effect on cells and
tissue and assists in joint mobility and range of motion.
Ingredients - Glucosamine
Hydrochloride, Chondroitin and Cetyl Myristoleate.
Directions - Simply place one
Glucosamine patch on a relatively hairless part of the body (the inner arm is
perfect). After 24 hours remove and replace with a new patch in a slightly
different position, to allow the skin to breathe (if there is any residue of
adhesive left on the skin, wash off with warm soapy water)
Slim Patch 30 Day Supply:
The
SlimPatch works by gradually releasing a blend of natural appetite
suppressants, via a patch which is placed on the body, containing ingredients
which remain effective for 24 hours. The patch can be replaced daily for an
indefinite period of time and has been proven to be extremely effective in
aiding weight loss without some of the harmful side-effects often associated
with dieting drugs. Effective, simple to use and completely natural,
SlimPatch contains additional nutrients to further supplement a
calorie-controlled diet, providing the body with minerals that can often be
lost through dieting. 
Each SlimPatch works for a full 24 hours, giving the
benefit of working while you are asleep.

Menopause Patch 30 Day Supply:  
The
Menopause Patch is a new drug free product which contains plant extracts
rich in phytoestrogens – natural plant-estrogens, as opposed to hormone
supplements.
By
applying the patch to the skin, symptoms such as mood swings, hot flushes,
night sweats, anxiety, depression and loss of libido can all be elevated,
providing a wonderful sense of normality. Menopause patch is totally natural.
It is not a medicine, but a carefully formulated holistic application which
causes no harmful side effects and can be used as frequently as required. Many
of the natural ingredients used in Menopause Patch, such as black cohosh and
ginger, have been long associated with helping to relieve symptoms of the
menopause. The patch also contains gotu kola which helps stimulate cell growth
and oat seed for nourishing the nervous system.
Safe
and simple to use, each patch is effective for up to 24 hours, offering a
natural solution to help better manage symptoms of the menopause. 
Ingredients - Gotu Kola
(Hydrocotyle Asiatica), Damiana (Turnera Aphrodisiaca), Black Cohoch
(Cimicifuga Racemosa), Valerian (Valeriana Officinalis), Skullcap (Scutellaria
Lateriflora), Oat Seed (Avena Sativa), Ginger (Zingiber Officinale).
Directions - Place one Menopause
Patch on a relatively hair free part of the body (inner arm, tummy or bottom).
After 24 hours remove and replace with a new patch in a slightly different
position to allow the skin to breathe (if there is any residue of adhesive left
on the skin, wash off with warm soapy water).
Insect Repellent Patch 10 Day
Supply:
Each
Insect Repellent Patch contains 75mg of Thiamine, a natural vitamin, this works
with the body’s own chemistry to create an invisible barrier that shields from
biting insects. The Insect Repellent Patch is ideal for holidays, fishing,
gardening, BBQ's, Picnics and all outdoor activities. We recommend use on
children over the age of 12 months. Thiamine is very hard to obtain through a
balanced diet as the cooking process destroys most of the vitamin. The body
typically needs less than 2mg of Thiamine per day for a healthy diet; excess
Thiamine is passed through the urine, breath and skin, the latter being
important. The Insect patch is a 36 hour patch.


 Effective, Easy to Apply, Safe


 Protection for Children And Adults from
mosquitoes other biting insects


 All over body protection for 36 hours without
reapplying


 Contains NO DEET or other harmful
chemicals


 No Sprays or Cream

Please
note: 
As with ALL Insect Repellents on the market, it is still possible to get
bitten!  An Insect Repellent will reduce the amount of bites but NO Insect
Repellent can guarantee no bites.

Reading cookbooks, learning new techniques by watching videos, and cooking at home almost every day.  You see, I have curated a really nice set of resources for myself to pull from that advance my skills in the kitchen.  Whether that be magazines, TV shows, food writers, or chefs...I know what I like and I know where to find it.  <br/><br/>It seems to me that 99% of people I know aren't pulling from what I would call the ""right"" resources.  I want to change that.<br/><br/>You guys that know me - friends, family, crossover fans of my band that like my food pics on instagram - are always asking for ""recipes"".  What an awful word.  I don't have ""recipes"".  I have just learned to cook.  I reference ""recipes"".  But rarely do I follow one.  <br/><br/>Technique.  Instinct.  Patience.  Attention to detail.  Good ingredients.  Proper resources.  That's what this book is going to give you.  Oh and yes...recipes (much to my dismay, but hell I want somebody to buy this thing.)<br/><br/>I want you to not suck at cooking.  And I want you to stop asking me how to not suck.  I'm not a ""chef"" (biggest pet peeve when people talk about my cooking).  I'm not a ""foodie"" (don't get me started).  I just care about eating well and I believe cooking is fun.  I'm here to point you in the right direction.  I want you to move on to BETTER resources than dumb ass Aaron Lunsford.  <br/>

<p><b>Human Health Watch Indiegogo Story </b></p>
<p><b><i>Health Care needs its Uber, Facebook and Bitcoin </i></b></p>
<p>The IT revolution made possible self-regulation of many areas of our lives that don’t require external controls any longer. Uber doesn’t need any external input while contacting drivers and passengers. Facebook easily will find people with the same interests all over the world. Even the financing sector, the most regulated part of the economy, has Bitcoins which provides people with an alternative way of paying for goods and services without involving a government and a central bank. These and many other information technology services provide opportunity to satisfy the needs of people using modern IT-tools. </p>
<p>Probably the only part of our life, which doesn’t have a self-regulated IT tool, is Health Care. For specific reasons: any decision in this field might have crucial consequences for peoples’ health, and even their lives. Patients prefer to get medical advice from doctors and pharmacists who have highly specialized educations and are licensed by the government to give medical advice and provide treatment. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446798479/ykox2qc26glbjqnwnurj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b><i>Only you are fully interested in your health care </i></b></p>
<p>We don’t want to question the how doctors and pharmacists decide about treatments for their patients. At the same time we really don’t know what the specific motivations of any medical professional may be for prescribing you a certain medicine. </p>
<p>The majority of Health Care personnel are driven by good intentions to help patients, yet other motives are also possible. Pharmacists want to sell modern, but more expensive medicals. There may be no motivation for them to offer older and cheaper pills which could also be effective and help? It may also be a case where there is no need in pills at all and herbs could provide the same relief? True motives of other people are unknown to other – this is a reality. The only party truly interested in the health care of a person for 100% is that person him/herself. </p>
<p>Each patient should have an alternative expert source of information – not just a doctor’s or pharmacists’ opinion. Which source? We believe it should be the Health Care Statistics from other people. </p>
<p><b><i>How did we come up with the idea? </i></b></p>
<p>In Bill Gates book, <i>Business @ the Speed of Thought, </i>we noticed the success story of two people who managed to win their battles against prostate cancer. Hamilton Jordan, President Carter’s chief of staff, “used the Internet to become an expert on his illness and took an active role in treating it”. The Chairman of Intel, Andy Grove, was also forced to become an expert. “After going online to see what information was available about the various medical approaches, he quickly realized that there were no valid comparative studies. Ever the scientist, he wrote his own comparative study from raw data!” </p>
<p>Later Bill Gates summarized: “Jordan, with a family history of prostate cancer, chose surgery. Grove, with a different history and circumstance, chose a combination of general and ‘smart bomb’ radiation therapy. The important thing is that with good medical advice and their own research, both men made informed decision by themselves”. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all people are able to make their own research! </p><p><b><i>What is Human Health Watch? </i></b></p>

Health Care needs its Uber, Facebook and Bitcoin 
The IT revolution made possible self-regulation of many areas of our lives that don’t require external controls any longer. Uber doesn’t need any external input while contacting drivers and passengers. Facebook easily will find people with the same interests all over the world. Even the financing sector, the most regulated part of the economy, has Bitcoins which provides people with an alternative way of paying for goods and services without involving a government and a central bank. These and many other information technology services provide opportunity to satisfy the needs of people using modern IT-tools. 
Probably the only part of our life, which doesn’t have a self-regulated IT tool, is Health Care. For specific reasons: any decision in this field might have crucial consequences for peoples’ health, and even their lives. Patients prefer to get medical advice from doctors and pharmacists who have highly specialized educations and are licensed by the government to give medical advice and provide treatment. 
Only you are fully interested in your health care 
We don’t want to question the how doctors and pharmacists decide about treatments for their patients. At the same time we really don’t know what the specific motivations of any medical professional may be for prescribing you a certain medicine. 
The majority of Health Care personnel are driven by good intentions to help patients, yet other motives are also possible. Pharmacists want to sell modern, but more expensive medicals. There may be no motivation for them to offer older and cheaper pills which could also be effective and help? It may also be a case where there is no need in pills at all and herbs could provide the same relief? True motives of other people are unknown to other – this is a reality. The only party truly interested in the health care of a person for 100% is that person him/herself. 
Each patient should have an alternative expert source of information – not just a doctor’s or pharmacists’ opinion. Which source? We believe it should be the Health Care Statistics from other people. 
How did we come up with the idea? 
In Bill Gates book, Business @ the Speed of Thought, we noticed the success story of two people who managed to win their battles against prostate cancer. Hamilton Jordan, President Carter’s chief of staff, “used the Internet to become an expert on his illness and took an active role in treating it”. The Chairman of Intel, Andy Grove, was also forced to become an expert. “After going online to see what information was available about the various medical approaches, he quickly realized that there were no valid comparative studies. Ever the scientist, he wrote his own comparative study from raw data!” 
Later Bill Gates summarized: “Jordan, with a family history of prostate cancer, chose surgery. Grove, with a different history and circumstance, chose a combination of general and ‘smart bomb’ radiation therapy. The important thing is that with good medical advice and their own research, both men made informed decision by themselves”. 
Unfortunately, not all people are able to make their own research! What is Human Health Watch? 
We are designing an IT-tool (a web-service and an App) which will provide users with medical statistics – special customized research on topic regarding how other people did overcome a similar illness. Human Health Watch is a universal medical tracker with the elements of a social network. Patients (or doctors upon request of patients) will put all their illness symptoms, test results and other details into special forms. Users will have their health histories, which will allow them to see trends and provide children with full medical map of their parents. 
At the later stages, when these forms have been filled-in by many people, users will have an overall picture of people’s health, personalized life expectancy, trends in the Health Care and a relative view of the health of mankind. Our fund raising company’s objective is to collect the money needed for the design of Human Health Watch, a revolutionary new IT-tool. 
Our mission 
To provide people with the very specialized capability of having and maintaining a healthy life through the careful tracking of health records based on the combined statistics of people from the individual up to the global levels. 
Why do you need Human Health Watch? 


Ability to always be able to get any details about their health history (no need to request any medical institution for data) 


Provide doctors with all information about health history in case of emergency, accidents, etc 


Use you medical tracker while travelling – the multilingual interface will be clear for all doctors in any part of the world 


To have a full set of records related to your previous diseases, treatments and all medical test results. You won’t forget what medication helped you the most! 


Ability to build and keep a track record of your family/region health history map 


To have the option of getting statistical records of treatment of similar/alternative treatments from other users 


Get a personal life expectancy estimate based on your health tracking/life style details 


Why mankind does need Human Health Watch? 


To be more healthy, strong and competitive as a biological kind 


To analyze modern trends in people’s health 


To decrease health care expenditures (because of more precise treatment) 


To establish a fair competition in pharmacy and health care industries

<br/><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to LAE. We started our wipe company to support our military 
personnel who were deployed outside of the wire. With that goal in mind 
we began to look at the needs of the military. Would our female service 
members benefit from our product? Should we make it larger and thicker 
for the males? Scented or unscented. Hmmm..Decisions 
Decisions.</p>
<p>Then we ran into a brick wall. Along the way a few hunters and truck 
drivers were given our sample wipes to test for field environments. It 
was love at first use. ""Can I get a few more for my next trip?"" ""I 
usually don't shower for a week while hunting and those worked really 
well.. Do you only make these for the military; because these work 
really really well.""</p>
<p>Well, LAE changed forever; so we went back to the drawing board. 
After many changes and designs  were made, we noticed that in many cases
 there was nothing available for homeless vets, natural disaster victims, home care 
patients, refugees and many other in need.  </p>
<p>Now here we are ready to give our wipes to the world. But funds are 
low for ordering product.  We need you Indiegogoers.  Please help us in 
acquiring the products we need. We have enlisted 2 manufactures to help 
with on time shipments. </p>
<p>Any amount pledged brings us one step closer to our goal. Help us spread the word by sharing our page.
<br/>Hopefully we can achieve our dream of helping cleaning the world one wipe at a time.</p>
<h3>For you</h3>Sponsors should be praised and made known 
to the world. We ask that you stand tall with your Proud Military 
Sponsor shirt or give some of the purchased packages to a homeless vet or homeless shelter. 
Maybe pick a cause that will help others and send a care package containing Shower wipes.<br/><br/><b>The Impact That You Make 
</b>
</div>
<p> The difference your contribution will make:</p> <ul>
<li>Service members regain their dignity when water is not available for showers</li>
<li>Military members have a way of keeping clean.</li>
<li>Make life better for our military men and women. </li>
</ul> <p></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Our team is comprised of seasoned military veterans, consultants, and
 a supply chain of experts with more than 30 years of experience in 
retail and distribution of products and services. The shower pack 
exceeds expectations in durability, cleanliness and time management.  We
 have perfected a wipe that saves time and leaves customers feeling fresh
 for any occasion. However, faced with few obstacles, we look to 
Indiegogoers as a means to assist with overcoming the challenges of 
production and shipment costs.  Currently, LAE has manufacturers 
identified who will ensure that customers receive their products within 
10 weeks of successful project funding. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>MANUFACTURING:</b>
<br/>Funds from Indiegogoers will afford LAE the opportunity to 
manufacture, ship and store products on site decreasing monthly 
expenditures significantly.  Therefore, having our own facility is a 
vehicle for us to control measures that are beyond our reach; a 
localized facility will ensure timely response to customers.  </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>STRENGTH MANAGEMENT:

 Short Summary
Welcome to LAE. We started our wipe company to support our military 
personnel who were deployed outside of the wire. With that goal in mind 
we began to look at the needs of the military. Would our female service 
members benefit from our product? Should we make it larger and thicker 
for the males? Scented or unscented. Hmmm..Decisions 
Decisions.
Then we ran into a brick wall. Along the way a few hunters and truck 
drivers were given our sample wipes to test for field environments. It 
was love at first use. ""Can I get a few more for my next trip?"" ""I 
usually don't shower for a week while hunting and those worked really 
well.. Do you only make these for the military; because these work 
really really well.""
Well, LAE changed forever; so we went back to the drawing board. 
After many changes and designs  were made, we noticed that in many cases
 there was nothing available for homeless vets, natural disaster victims, home care 
patients, refugees and many other in need.  
Now here we are ready to give our wipes to the world. But funds are 
low for ordering product.  We need you Indiegogoers.  Please help us in 
acquiring the products we need. We have enlisted 2 manufactures to help 
with on time shipments. 
Any amount pledged brings us one step closer to our goal. Help us spread the word by sharing our page.
Hopefully we can achieve our dream of helping cleaning the world one wipe at a time.
For youSponsors should be praised and made known 
to the world. We ask that you stand tall with your Proud Military 
Sponsor shirt or give some of the purchased packages to a homeless vet or homeless shelter. 
Maybe pick a cause that will help others and send a care package containing Shower wipes.The Impact That You Make 


 The difference your contribution will make: 
Service members regain their dignity when water is not available for showers
Military members have a way of keeping clean.
Make life better for our military men and women. 
 
Risks and challenges
Our team is comprised of seasoned military veterans, consultants, and
 a supply chain of experts with more than 30 years of experience in 
retail and distribution of products and services. The shower pack 
exceeds expectations in durability, cleanliness and time management.  We
 have perfected a wipe that saves time and leaves customers feeling fresh
 for any occasion. However, faced with few obstacles, we look to 
Indiegogoers as a means to assist with overcoming the challenges of 
production and shipment costs.  Currently, LAE has manufacturers 
identified who will ensure that customers receive their products within 
10 weeks of successful project funding. 

MANUFACTURING:
Funds from Indiegogoers will afford LAE the opportunity to 
manufacture, ship and store products on site decreasing monthly 
expenditures significantly.  Therefore, having our own facility is a 
vehicle for us to control measures that are beyond our reach; a 
localized facility will ensure timely response to customers.  

STRENGTH MANAGEMENT:
""Team work makes the dream work.""  Our team is small but powerful 
with each Lead excelling within their role at LAE, we will continue to 
expand the company.  Any amount pledged brings us one step closer to our
 goal. Sharing our page will help the average consumer save time, money 
and resources one wipe at a time; we strive to please our customers.",42.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Rise of Bootie Camp Yoga®</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Michelle Trabelsi and I am the creator of Bootie Camp Yoga®, a power yoga based fitness program that sculpts the derriere!  I created Bootie Camp Yoga® 4 years ago
because my booty needed a little more than my ""Power, Flow &amp; Balance"" Yoga
practice had to offer.  I wanted to create a challenging work out that was
safe for those with injuries, like myself, that was completely kick-butt, and
that also offered deep stretching!</p>
<p>This FUN hobby of mine has blossomed into a popular
&amp; nationally accredited fitness program that Las Vegas people call
<b>""Vegas's BEST Kept Secret""</b>.  Bootie Camp Yoga® is in over 15 gyms in
Southern California, 4 in Las Vegas, with certified instructors in 5 other states, two of which were certified virtually!  To date, I have  certified over 50 Bootie Camp Yoga® instructors &amp; trainees, 30 of which are actively teaching in both small &amp; well known fitness centers such as, Gold's Gym, YMCA &amp; now piloting in 24 Hour Fitness!  <br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>Bootie Camp Yoga® has grown organically in a small area, and in a relatively short amount of time.  I am at a place where instructors in other areas on the planet are not only SUPER interested in teaching this format, but also becoming master instructors in their area. <b>THIS is EXCITING!</b>  The fact that I can certify instructor's virtually is even more exciting!</p>

</h3><p>ProFlex is the first of many products offered by the company FortiFlex.  ProFlex is meant to be added into your existing protein in order to change the flavor.  If you have a tub of protein and are tired of the same chocolate, vanilla or flavor you already purchase, then ProFlex offers the solution you have been looking for.  We have conducted extensive taste tests to ensure you get the best tasting product, and are also backed by a team of food scientists.  It really works!  ProFlex takes advantage of whatever sweetener is already contained in your existing protein, therefore it is sugar free.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Current Flavors</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454347166/lxdx6pjajkrydyxxv274.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Nutritional Facts</h3><p>ProFlex contains no sugar and no artificial sweeteners.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454347677/ifdj3of7bpc680f2w537.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>The FortiFlex Story<br/>

<p>While preparing for his first NPC physique competition, Chris came to the realization that the actual training was easy compared to the diet. After his competition, Chris mentioned to his brother Jack that he couldn’t drink his protein anymore, because drinking the same flavor over and over was making him gag. Jack then confessed that his protein powder had been sitting in his
cabinet untouched for months. Like so many others, they were bored and tired with their protein flavor. They looked for ways to change their flavors on the internet and found very few solutions, many of  which required using the products' specific flavorless
protein powder. This was not convenient.  They liked their favorite protein powders; they just wanted it to taste
different without having to buy another huge tub of protein. <br/></p> With the basic idea of changing the flavor of one's protein in mind, they started working with a local but
reputable food processing company that focused on powders. They were able to
develop some amazing flavors that not only changed the way their protein tasted, but
made it more convenient by offering them in stick packs. That was when their company was born, and thus came Proflex, the first of many products to be offered by Fortiflex. Proflex offers a convenient way to keep your protein and change your flavors, while staying SUGAR FREE!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>The Mission of FortiFlex<br/>
</h3>
<p>Our mission is to help you overcome the monotony of flavors that plagues your diet and get you back on track to hitting your fitness goals! We currently have 4 flavors but we need YOUR help to develop more flavors! This will give you more options to choose EXACTLY which
flavors YOU want to drink and not just the flavor of protein you are stuck buying. Why should your fitness diet suffer when the solution is
simple? Change your flavors and get back to work.</p>
<h2>It works in 3 easy steps!</h2>

</p>
<p>We hope ProFlex will have an impact in the fitness world by helping
people maintain their fitness diets with ease. Many people quit drinking
protein due to the monotonous flavors. This can be discouraging, especially for
people trying to build muscle or lean up. Whatever the reason, ProFlex can help
you overcome the monotony of flavors and aid you in your fitness journey.</p>

</div></div>","What is ProFlex
ProFlex is the first of many products offered by the company FortiFlex.  ProFlex is meant to be added into your existing protein in order to change the flavor.  If you have a tub of protein and are tired of the same chocolate, vanilla or flavor you already purchase, then ProFlex offers the solution you have been looking for.  We have conducted extensive taste tests to ensure you get the best tasting product, and are also backed by a team of food scientists.  It really works!  ProFlex takes advantage of whatever sweetener is already contained in your existing protein, therefore it is sugar free.Current FlavorsNutritional FactsProFlex contains no sugar and no artificial sweeteners.The FortiFlex Story
 

While preparing for his first NPC physique competition, Chris came to the realization that the actual training was easy compared to the diet. After his competition, Chris mentioned to his brother Jack that he couldn’t drink his protein anymore, because drinking the same flavor over and over was making him gag. Jack then confessed that his protein powder had been sitting in his
cabinet untouched for months. Like so many others, they were bored and tired with their protein flavor. They looked for ways to change their flavors on the internet and found very few solutions, many of  which required using the products' specific flavorless
protein powder. This was not convenient.  They liked their favorite protein powders; they just wanted it to taste
different without having to buy another huge tub of protein.  With the basic idea of changing the flavor of one's protein in mind, they started working with a local but
reputable food processing company that focused on powders. They were able to
develop some amazing flavors that not only changed the way their protein tasted, but
made it more convenient by offering them in stick packs. That was when their company was born, and thus came Proflex, the first of many products to be offered by Fortiflex. Proflex offers a convenient way to keep your protein and change your flavors, while staying SUGAR FREE!
The Mission of FortiFlex

Our mission is to help you overcome the monotony of flavors that plagues your diet and get you back on track to hitting your fitness goals! We currently have 4 flavors but we need YOUR help to develop more flavors! This will give you more options to choose EXACTLY which
flavors YOU want to drink and not just the flavor of protein you are stuck buying. Why should your fitness diet suffer when the solution is
simple? Change your flavors and get back to work.
It works in 3 easy steps!
ProFlex mixes simultaneously with your protein powder in a shaker bottle. See instructions below:
What we need and what you get


 
If our goal of raising $50,000.00 is met, we will use the
money to do the following:
· Develop 4-6 new flavors (Orange, Mixed Berry, Peach, Peanut Butter, Cinnamon Roll, & Mint)                            · Packaging and distribution of product                                                                                 · Marketing and brand recognition

If our goal is not met, we will develop
as many flavors and packages as we can with the money we raise.
The Impact










We hope ProFlex will have an impact in the fitness world by helping
people maintain their fitness diets with ease. Many people quit drinking
protein due to the monotonous flavors. This can be discouraging, especially for
people trying to build muscle or lean up. Whatever the reason, ProFlex can help
you overcome the monotony of flavors and aid you in your fitness journey.








Stretch Goal 1: $75k

Our goal is to launch as many flavors as possible for protein powders with our original $50k goal. If we are able to reach a $75k goal we will launch a secondary product for pre-workout flavors

Stretch Goal 2: $100k
Our goal is to make a large array
of options for protein and pre-workout drinks. If we are able to reach $100k we
will produce our supplement products which will continue to add ease and convenience to your diets and help you acheive your fitness goals.

you want to tell your friends about it. The more people who know, the more money
we can raise and create flavors for you. Please don’t hesitate to share this with

<p>For the 1.8 million family farms in the US, the largest non-labor inputs are water and fertilizer.  Based on our research, a 200-acre farm will spend ~$50,000 per year in fertilizer.  An estimated 30% or $15,000 is wasted through over-fertilization due to an inability to confidently assess the health of the plant.  Unfortunately, the current methods for assessing the Nitrogen content of a plant are either too expensive, inconvenient, or inaccurate. The FarmVitals solution is an easy-to-use mobile and web application allowing farmers to upload pictures of the crops in question and receive an analysis of the plant’s Nitrogen content for $500 per year.

Only $39. There's even a snack door.We're proud to introduce the Hunny.Hunny is a bear resistant canister engineered with ultra-light, extremely strong aircraft composites. Ultem resin is a versatile, and cost-effective compound, and is the only resin that is certified food safe. You'll find this material in everything from surgery rooms to military aircraft. At just 1.27 grams per cubic centimeter, the resin has an incredibly high compression strength of 19,500 PSI. For comparison:
Bear Bite: 850 PSI
Bear Stomp: 2,000 PSI
Hunny Canister: 19,500 PSI
Because of this incredibly high compressive strength ratio, we are able to create a bear can that is light, voluminous, and a fun experience to use.Check out this video of a hollow fixture that weighs less than 1 ounce holding the weight of 600 kg. 

 
 Hunny canisters are the lightest and strongest canisters on the market. We are offering three types of Hunny Cans: 
The Hunny Canister: Limited Edition that includes resin lids and the alloy mess kit. 25 ounces, $39.
The Hunny Canister: Bear Necessities Edition with just resin lids and no snack door,  13.4 ounces, $25.
The Hunny Ursa Minor, the lightest bear can ever. Only 8 ounces, $19. (limited quantity)
(Check back for updates on the HunnyPots accessory!)Hunny weighs less than the lightest bear can on the market (the Bare Boxer Contender), but can hold more food than the Garcia model!     Built-In Scent-Capturing Technology.Each Hunny has an inner layer permeated with activated carbon, which captures scents before they escape the bear can!Hunny cans are also multifunctional. The lids double as a stove-safe mess kit...(NOTE: Every Hunny also ships with 2 Resin Lids, if you are all about the ounces. Some areas have restrictions on open bear canisters while preparing food- check the rules for your area before you start cookin'!) A double sided design means you will never have to repack your can to get food at the bottom again!HUNNY CANISTERS are the 21st century solution for carrying food in the backcountry. We need your help to get it approved.These canisters are not yet approved for federal and state agency park use. Our fundraising campaign is geared towards creating a product that is approved for NPS use by next summer. $1.00 from the sale of each canister will go towards better management of human-bear interactions.The canisters need to pass a 3-4 month series of tests before it can gain conditional approval by the Sierra Interagency Black Bear Group (SIBBG), and we are raising funds to iterate our materials testing and product development to get a canister to market before next summer. Cost Breakdown (September 2016 estimates, Hunny Ltd. Ed.)
10.5 ounces ULTEM resin, $5.56
Total weight of Titanium-Aluminum Alloy not including scrap costs (May ’16 Alibaba Market Billet Prices), $5.59
Daily manufacturing cost for 40 canister/day production line (labor costs amortized at scale), CreatorBot 3D Pro Series (3 machines, $8355 total), $22.89
Donation to park agencies for wildlife management, $1.00
Labor and operational costs, $4.00
TOTAL ESTIMATED COST $39.04

For every can we sell, we will donate $1.00 to park agencies that manage better human-bear interactions. Help us help humans and bears alike, and get a Hunny today!

 found Mindfulness and Meditation in 2012.  Having barely survived the

effective treatment for stress, anxiety, lack of focus, addictions, 
depression, chronic pain and a host of other ailments. Meditation 
improves our physical health, including lowering blood pressure, 
boosting the immune system, and increasing our ability to cope with 
stress.  It leads to peace of mind and well-being, greater focus and 
creativity and better relationships. Mindful awareness practices also 
include yoga and tai chi. Studies confirm that with repetition, mindful

<p>Take the example of a busy mum, running around all day, taking care of her family, she may also be working full or part time. The amount of energy used during the day is huge, she is ""<i>exercising</i>"" without  going to the gym! The body needs a balanced combined of macro and micro nutrients that must include protein, vitamins, complex carbohydrates and minerals all delivered at the same time, to refresh, refuel and repair the body.</p>
<p>Without the correct nutrition and rest, the body can not fully recover, ready for another busy day of ""exercise"" and we start to get run down, physically and mentally</p>
<p><i>Exercise</i> comes in many different forms, you don't have to become a gym junkie to enjoy the benefits of exercise. Find a form of <i>exercise</i> that appeals to<i> you </i> and just start!...TODAY!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Questions &amp; Answers</h3>
<p><strong>Q, Why do we need protein?</strong></p>
<p>A. Proteins are the building blocks of life and our bodies can't produce it or store it</p>
<p><strong>Q. What type of protein is in Xrcise Fuel</strong></p>
<p>A. We use only the highest quality whey protein isolate</p>
<p><strong>Q. Are there any other flavours?</strong></p>
<p>A. We are looking at introducing more flavour later, let us know what flavour you would like.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What sweetener do you use in Xrcise Fuel?</strong></p>
<p>A. We use the natural sweetener, Stevia</p>
<p><strong>Q. Why put Protein, Vitamins, Minerals and Complex Carbohydrates in one drink?</strong></p>
<p>A. Extensive scientific research shows that in order for our body to get the best results and recovery from exercise, we must consume all these ingredients at the same time. If we don't our body can't assimilate and use the protein to repair the muscles, it will use the protein as energy, thereby placing our body in a state of ""catabolism""</p>
<p><strong>Q, What exactly does ""catabolism"" mean?</strong></p>
<p>A. Simple - all that hard work, effort and time you put into your exercise and health won't give you the maximum return on your investment (YOU!), because you are not fuelling it correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How many bottles can I have a day?</strong></p>
<p>A. Recommended amount is one a day, we believe Xrcise Fuel should be used, together with a healthy, balanced nutrition plan.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Can I buy it in different size bottles?</strong></p>
<p>A. We only have the 500ml/16.9 fl oz bottles at this stage, however we will be looking at other sizes as we grow. Please let us know what is your preferred size.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Where can I buy it?</strong></p>
<p>A. You can buy on line via our website <a href=""http://www.xrcisefuel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.xrcisefuel.com</a> go to XF Shop. We are currently working with retailers to stock our drinks and will continually keep you updated as to where you can buy. Where would you like to be able to buy it?...let us know. We will also look at a second manufacturing plant for our drink in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Will you ship it anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>A. We will try, test us out. We will come back to you with the costs and time frame depending on where you live.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Can I buy multiple perks?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes, if you'd like multiple perks, please make a new contribution for each perk.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Why does exercise help our mood?</strong></p>
<p>A. Exercise boosts serotine levels in our brain that releases a good dose of endorphins into our bod. Regular exercise is one of the most effective prevention and treatment strategies for depression</p>
<p><strong>Q. Will exercise have the same affect if I am feeling anxious or stressed</strong></p>
<p>A. Absolutely, exercise is the cheapest and healthiest form of therapy on the planet!</p>
<p><strong>Q. Do I have to become a gym junkie?</strong></p>
<p>A. Absolutely NOT!, any form of moderate, regular exercise (walking, golfing, hiking, tennis, cycling, swimming, skiing, weights, boxing, skipping, and the list goes on forever) combined with good nutrition and adequate rest will make a huge difference.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Will it help cure addictions?</strong></p>
<p>A.  We ALL have addictions, to varying degrees. It is what we choose, to be addicted to that matters. Choose exercise and great nutrition and you will be amazed at the benefits, without the down side of other addictive habits. While not a cure, it is a brilliant management tool.</p>

<p>I'm a professional high board diving coach, FINA Olympic judge, master trainer, business management fitness consultant and an inventor. Working with individuals for over than 20 years to solve the common problem of back pain almost everybody suffers from, which I do myself suffer from Foraminal Stenosis:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513162759/rnxyevfgtkowvahgam4u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And Spondylolisthesis combined with degenerative disc disease as the diagnosis in my scheduled back surgery documents says:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513282440/wgq7tamikpif7xvh8guk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I am so terrified of going under the knife for back surgery or any other surgery to be honest. I had to find an alternative non invasive way to relive my 24/7 back pain. As it is proven fact that, the success rate to relieve the back pain by surgery is very slim.</p>
<p>Seeing the huge amount of people suffering from back pain, the high costs to get rid of the pain and the effort made by the patients to experience back pain relief it came clear to me as I am attending an international back pain management convention, and listening to the same question again and again from the participants to the medical experts, the question was, how can one experience some pain relieve even for few minutes a week?! The answer was there is no magic pill for this! Either go for the surgery or take medication.

</div><p> </p></div>","I'm a professional high board diving coach, FINA Olympic judge, master trainer, business management fitness consultant and an inventor. Working with individuals for over than 20 years to solve the common problem of back pain almost everybody suffers from, which I do myself suffer from Foraminal Stenosis:

And Spondylolisthesis combined with degenerative disc disease as the diagnosis in my scheduled back surgery documents says:

I am so terrified of going under the knife for back surgery or any other surgery to be honest. I had to find an alternative non invasive way to relive my 24/7 back pain. As it is proven fact that, the success rate to relieve the back pain by surgery is very slim.
Seeing the huge amount of people suffering from back pain, the high costs to get rid of the pain and the effort made by the patients to experience back pain relief it came clear to me as I am attending an international back pain management convention, and listening to the same question again and again from the participants to the medical experts, the question was, how can one experience some pain relieve even for few minutes a week?! The answer was there is no magic pill for this! Either go for the surgery or take medication. DeCOMPRESSit® is the ultimate treatment because there is not a single treatment, which could actually cater to all body types, overweight, obese and elderly people as well as people with special conditions, patients with heart-problem or high blood pressure, patients and pregnant women to serve or to cater to the back-pain issues they have. It was not found a single treatment, done from the upright natural position without machines, weights, human assistance, or without creating unnecessary issues or done frequently, from home or office, with as low cost as possible.
By backing DeCOMPRESSit® we will be able not only to bring back pain relieve to almost anybody in their own comfort zone and homes, we are also reaching out to less fortunate people to help them with their back pain. Basically, we are a treatment for the good of humanity. 
In the matter of one year to the date, from the day the idea reached the patent office until it became an international movement we had exhausted and dried all our financial savings but we had increased our manpower and we managed to increase the amount of participants and audience nationally and internationally. We are asking for $ 37,000.00 to allow us to bring our treatment to the international market as we will take place in the ISPO Munich trade show in January 2018. That is the main reason we are asking for backing in this short time. 

Our unique DeCOMPRESSit® belt signed by the inventor will be provided to our backers to use for themselves or their loved ones. Our backers will be part of our good of humanity back pain relief movement. 
We will use any funds to keep educating more people on our simple, easy treatment.

As our movement been approved and backed by highly respected medical back specialists. DeCOMPRESSit® is the alternative non-invasive treatment in all natural ways and drug-free. 
It is worth it to mention that, for so many years I have been treating people with back issues each has his own individual diagnosis and back pain level, manage tremendously relieve the level of pain, increase the level of mobility  and helping patients to live very healthy lifestyle.

<p>The story of TruPosture starts with real back
pain. Company founder Dan Ikoyan, an avid runner and mountain biker, found
himself complaining of spinal pain. After several visits to the doctor and physical
therapist, he was surprised to hear that the pain was simply due to bad
posture. The challenge was to remember the ""good posture"" his physical
therapist was recommending after he’d left the clinic. The experience lead him to
the idea of a simple device that measures the curvature of the spine and helps maintain
a good posture through feedback. Hence, the TruPosture smart shirt was born!</p>

Dan set about receiving a patent on the

spirits that would apply the technology and refine it to create the TruPosture
shirt that is ready for the consumer. Dan and co-founder George Winston along

<p><b>Question</b>:  How can wearing the shirt regularly lead to reduced back pain?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:  TruPosture helps by reminding you to correct your posture whenever your posture deviates from your pre-set ideal.  By engaging your core and dorsal muscles to correct your posture, you will strengthen them, as well as develop a good posture habit. Having a strong core and dorsal muscles takes the stress off your spine, the source of your pain.  We recommend routinely using the shirt for several weeks until the muscles strengthen, and healthy posture becomes a habit. After that we suggest you periodically use the shirt to reinforce the habit. In the long term, maintaining a good posture will keep those muscles strong, and keep the stress off your spine. TruPosture works by utilizing nano sensors embedded in the soft lycra shirt to track your spine alignment. Once you’ve set an optimal posture goal the sensors will keep track of when you deviate from your goal, reminding you with gentle vibrations and app alerts to improve your posture again.</p>
<p><br/><b>Question</b>:  How does it compare to sitting on an exercise ball?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:  An exercise ball is effective but will not tell you if your posture is correct (the two curves of the spine). The first thing you notice when you sit at your desk with the TruPosture shirt on is that to maintain a correct posture you now have to adjust the environment around you to accommodate your healthy posture (chair, monitor, etc), whereas before you were sacrificing your posture to accommodate the “bad” environment around you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/>Question</b>:  How can I select my size and shirt type?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:  After the campaign is over we will contact you to ask for your preferred size and shirt type.</p>

The solution is simple: The TruPosture smart shirt. We designed it to help you maintain a healthy back posture and help reduce back pain. TruPosture is a nano-sensor enabled, comfort-fit smart shirt that’s packed with technology and features. TruPosture trains your back, resulting in improved posture that sticks.


With your support, TruPosture can help millions of people who suffer with back pain. We can tell the world about our smart shirt that features patented, nano-sensor technology and can track the alignment of the entire spine.

<p> It will enable us to get the necessary educational info up on our website and further develop Arya Earth's online community.</p>

</p><div>
</div><p>Knowledge is the most powerful gift you can give another
person. Arya Earth’s mission doesn’t stop with cannabis. It is our sacred duty
to educate individuals that a healthy complete nutritious protien/ garden diet is the key to vitality and
feeling ones best.</p><div>
</div><p>Our cities and towns are flooded with toxic drugs, foods and
beverages. High fructose corn syrup kills thousands of people every year. People can’t take care of
themselves much less their families because people do not have available the essential
components of a healthy diet in order to flourish.</p><div>
The antidotal evidence that exists regarding the different
treatment possibilities for cannabis is endless. Cannabinoids treats a broad spectrum of physical
and mental aliments including cancer, disease, epilepsy, PTSD, alcohol &amp;
drug dependence, chronic pain and many neuropathic disorders.
</div><div>
Arya Earth truly believes that cannabis is the missing link,
not having it regulated and safely available is comprising the mental health of
people everywhere. Cannabis is destine to play a major role in healing our
addicted, toxic streets and making the world a safer place.</div><div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> 

</p>
<p>Many Organizations Including the American Medical
Association and The Epilepsy Foundation have approached the FDA,
NIDA and DEA to ask for allowing approved clinical studies. In every case they have been denied. Our
goal is to educate the people. When the people know the Truth, The people
become the Voice!!!</p>

   What We Need & What You Get Arya Earth Must raise 250,000  dollars for startup funding to quickly become self-sufficient and get our message out to the world.
   This funding will allow Arya Earth to hire a full time grant writer in 2015.
 It will enable us to get the necessary educational info up on our website and further develop Arya Earth's online community.
 It will enable Arya to contract and utilize a media communication team to boost our message across TV, radio and internet networks.
It will also allow us to reserve booth space at medical expos and physician related events to get valuble face time with medical professionals
When  the people learn the truth  about what cannabis is and means to the human body, it will change the way we veiw medicine.
 When the people learn the truth. The peoples become the voice of power!!        
This
funding will also allow us to immediately begin helping and educating veterans
and other suffering people on how to grow their own legal cannabis plants in
Washington D.C.  Thanks to the
""Legalization of Possession of Minimal Amounts of Marijuana Personal Use
Act of 2014""--D.C. Code 48-904.01-- 1
    The Impact 

Knowledge is the most powerful gift you can give another
person. Arya Earth’s mission doesn’t stop with cannabis. It is our sacred duty
to educate individuals that a healthy complete nutritious protien/ garden diet is the key to vitality and
feeling ones best.
Our cities and towns are flooded with toxic drugs, foods and
beverages. High fructose corn syrup kills thousands of people every year. People can’t take care of
themselves much less their families because people do not have available the essential
components of a healthy diet in order to flourish.
The antidotal evidence that exists regarding the different
treatment possibilities for cannabis is endless. Cannabinoids treats a broad spectrum of physical
and mental aliments including cancer, disease, epilepsy, PTSD, alcohol &
drug dependence, chronic pain and many neuropathic disorders.

Arya Earth truly believes that cannabis is the missing link,
not having it regulated and safely available is comprising the mental health of
people everywhere. Cannabis is destine to play a major role in healing our
addicted, toxic streets and making the world a safer place.
  Risks & Challenges  


Many Organizations Including the American Medical
Association and The Epilepsy Foundation have approached the FDA,
NIDA and DEA to ask for allowing approved clinical studies. In every case they have been denied. Our
goal is to educate the people. When the people know the Truth, The people
become the Voice!!!

<h3>M-brace was founded by two former Temple University engineering graduates. My name is Michael Carey and I received a B.S in Bioengineering with a concentration in Bio-mechanics. My co-founder is Nija White, who received a B.S in Bioengineering with a concentration in Neuroengineering.</h3>
<h3>As a former student-athletes, both Nija and I excelled on the field until an injury forced us to end our athletic careers. We spent a lot of time on the sidelines wondering how we could get back into the game quicker and contribute to our team's success. Now, with our playing days behind us, we are looking to turn our passion into possibilities. We believe that our brace will not only prevent A.C.L. injuries but also help those athletes whose career was sidelined by injury get back to playing sooner rather than later. </h3>
<h3>By contributing to our campaign, you will help us get closer to achieving not only our dreams but also to helping athletes avoid such devastating injuries in the first place.</h3>
<h3>Your contribution will help us get to develop our next generation prototype. </h3>
<h3>Our goal is to raise $25,000.</h3>
<h3>The funds will be used to produce prototypes to further testing in clinical trials so that we can expedite the production process and get into the market faster to help athletes sooner. Any contribution amount will help, but if you donate $50 dollars or more you will receive one our new company t-shirts, available in sizes from adult small to 2X!</h3>
<h3>If you are unable to donate at this time, we would really appreciate you sharing this post and getting the word out!</h3>
<h3>Our device will help athletes at all playing levels. However, it is widely known that many professional athletes suffer devastating injuries like an A.C.L. tear, and are never able to return to their initial playing ability. Many will miss out on signing that big contract, potentially losing out on millions of dollars! By using our first knee device, we can help prevent A.C.L. tears and help save the career of professional athletes as well as those in high-school and college.</h3>
<h3>Those players using our device will likely prevent a major knee injury or rehabilitate the injured knee faster as the amount of physical therapy sessions needed will be drastically lowered - saving the athlete from enduring the often rigorous and painful therapy exercises.</h3>
<h3>During this entire production process, there will, no doubt, be obstacles along the way. Commercial success will not happen overnight and the clinical trials can take up to a year to complete. Nija and I have put in a lot of design and development work already. We have a patent application pending. We are completely committed to this process and our designs. We are determined to do whatever it takes in order to achieve our dream and will continue to work every day to prepare for the challenges ahead.

Why I do what I do...

My name is Tim Cox of Sacred Line Collective, a fine art and medical tattoo studio. I have been a professional artist for over 25 years and a tattooist since 2009. When my ex wife was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, I turned my attention to medical tattooing in an effort to show my two beautiful daughters that cancer would not be allowed to define us. I wanted to use my skills to make a difference. 

Why there is a need...
The
Womens Health & Cancer Right's Act of 1998 (WHCRA) requires areola and nipple reconstruction be
paid by insurance. (see Dept of Labor website link below). If everyone had insurance, and insurance companies did the right
thing, there would be no need for this fund. Unfortunately, there are many
women that are under or uninsured. This leaves a large percentage of
women unable to afford the final stage of their journey. Doctors send me women
in this situation from around the country. However, I simply can't afford to
continue to provide all of these procedures pro bono.

<li><p>The DrinkGuardian Company is co-owned by Andrew

is a specialist in his chosen field and has worked in special effects and

are subject to Non Disclosure Agreements. 
He has recently been commissioned to build specialist water filter controllers

<li><br/></li>
<li><p>The campaign for which we are seeking crowd funding is to produce, promote and distribute a brand new invention  -  the DrinkGuardian anti-drink-spiking device, which will detect and prevent the harmful and criminal act of drugging drinks. The DrinkGuardian also has the potential to identify the offender at the  very moment of the offence. </p></li>
<li><p>This device has been created by Roger Crates and Andrew Goodall and will revolutionise the ability for young women to feel confident that they can drink safely on their nights out.</p></li>
<li><p>Roger Crates says: “My interest in the
eradication of drink spiking started, when
I found out my grand-daughter had probably been subjected to drink spiking. She
was fortunately<span>  taken home by friends
after this drink spiking  attempt, but
the outcome could have been dire.  She
was lucky, but this incident prompted me to research the subject. </span>I was
staggered to find the seriousness and extent of this criminal and sexually
motivated crime.<span>  I imagined a definitive
solution to the problem and asked Andrew Goodall to build what is now the DrinkGuardian
anti-drink-spiking device, and to make it inexpensive to make it available at a
reasonable price.</span></p></li>
<li>This funding campaign, with your help, will enable Andrew and Roger to finalise the creation of a new and highly technical component, and allow them to get the product manufactured for sale, initially in Australia and internationally.</li>
<li>The provisional patent number is 2014905170.</li>
</ul><p>This is a socially important product that effectively stops drink spiking from happening in the first place and in the rare instance where someone may try to tamper with a glass protected with a DrinkGuardian the offender will be identified immediately.  </p><ul><li>
<strong>DrinkGuardian  is low cost, reusable, and rechargeable and has the potential to save lives while ensuring the safety of its user in any situation where alcoholic drinks are consumed. The device addresses all problems connected to drink spiking.</strong> </li></ul><p>It is battery operated (long-life and re-chargable), inexpensive, portable, stylish simple and foolproof and will appeal to younger women, their parents and husbands who are concerned with safety.</p><p>The user simply places the DrinkGuardian  on the top of the glass. After switching on the device it will be in the ready mode via radio signal, from a transmitter worn on the wrist or placed in a handbag etc much like a close range garage door opener. The display shows green. The flashing red and blue lights activate when touched by anyone other than the user. </p><p>It is obvious that no perpetrator would dare to be seen or heard tampering with a drink protected by DrinkGuardian in a public place. THEY WILL BE CAUGHT.</p><ul><li>
<strong>Drink spiking is a serious crime against women, the object of which is at best robbery and at worst rape or even murder. Your contribution will go a long way to ensuring women will be protected from the criminals who place drugs in  drinks in a social situation</strong>.</li></ul><p></p><p>Drink spiking is typically perpetrated against young women in socially vulnerable situations where alcohol is served. The end result is at best, sexual abuse, with rape as the objective. Many cases result in murder.  It has been estimated this sexual abuse is happening on a vast scale, some estimates are in the millions annually worldwide. In the extreme, drink spiking is often the starting point for obtaining women for the sexual slave trade.</p><p>In the extreme, drink spiking is often the starting point for obtaining women for the global sexual slave trade.</p><p>Unfortunately the authorities around the world have difficulty in their estimates simply because in many cases the victim does not know what actually happened, </p><p>Such is the effect of several date rape drugs including Rohypnol. In many other cases the victims are under the impression they got carried away emotionally while drunk, and sadly come out of the incident with a feeling of guilt. Naturally this is not true.  It is not their fault! In other instances the victim is too embarassed to report the rape or sexual assault. </p><p>It is well known that the perpetrators of this heinous behaviour often hide behind the uncertainty or embassesment of the victims and the devestating effect the episode has on them.</p><p>The team at DrinkGuardian believe all people deserve to have their night out in safety away from these criminals and the appalling acts they commit. </p><p><strong>Up till now the actual capture of the perpetrators has been very difficult because the perpetrator has to be seen to actually tamper with the drink to be charged with that offense.</strong>  </p><p>DrinkGuardian  not only makes it impossible to contaminate a drink when in use but the perpetrator will be SEEN to be trying to place drugs in the drink. No other drink spiking system is able to do this,. This ensures the completeness of the DrinkGuardian  approach to this terrible practice. (Provisional Patent  #2014905170) </p> <p></p><ul>
</ul><p><strong> What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p> </p><p></p><ul>
<li>We are seeking fifty thousand dollars.  This will ensure the final vigorous testing and accreditation will be completed and initial production, release and distribution of the DrinkGuardian anti-drink-spiking device will be carried out.<br/>
</li>
<li>As part of our fund raising campaign and in appreciation of your contribution of one hundred and fifty dollars or more we will send you a complimentary DrinkGuardian anti-drink-spiking device free of charge as a thank you gesture.  We are also considering setting up an affiliate program. <br/>When the DrinkGuardian is available for sale, it is anticipated the recommended retail price will be only $69.95 Au (or equivalent USD)</li>
<li> If we do not reach our goal of fifty thousand dollars we will continue to look for ways to fund our dream using the money you have entrusted to us.  We will be able to start with less but naturally it is better to have an initial starting point adequate to provide the best reach for the DrinkGuardian anti-drink-spiking device.</li>
<li>The provisional patent number is 2014905170, and DrinkGuardian is trademarked. </li>
</ul><p><br/></p><ul> </ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p> </p><p></p><ul>
<li>The DrinkGuardian project is unique in that we are producing a product which will actually <em><strong>prevent</strong></em> drink spiking from happening.  There are other protective systems and while they can detect drugs already in the drink they don't stop drink spiking from happening in the first place.  DrinkGuardian is unique in that it has the potential to actually <strong>stop the criminal practice of drink spiking in its tracks.</strong><br/>Drink spiking is at best an attempt to rob and/or rape, and tragically young women have been murdered after drink spiking. On occasions drink spiking has been known to be the first step in slave trading of women for prostitution. <br/>Drink spiking is prevalent in most of the western world.  Police from many countries have been frustrated in their attempts to successfully charge and bring to just the perpetrators, as it has been almost impossible to detect a drink spiking incident, which is one crime, and then connect it to the robbery or sexual assault that follows.  Our product identifies the perpetrator instantly,</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><ul> </ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is an entirely new product which has never been seen before, and people may compare it with other products on the market. It will be vital to explain why this is a far better and more effective product, and what makes it unique.  <br/>The idea can be stolen in this early stage and inferior imitations produced if we do not get the funding to manufacture quickly enough. <br/>
</p><p>In marketing and promoting this brand new product we will need to explain that whilst all other products currently on the market only detect the presence of drugs in the drink after the event, our product is unique in that it will actually prevents the drink spiking and also identifies the perpetrator if he even touches the DrinkGuardian. <br/></p><ul>
<li>Andrew's innovative technical expertise allows the DrinkGuardian product to go into the manufacturing as a fully tested and long lasting product.  Roger's understanding of marketing process and understanding of charitable endeavours  provide a unique blend of talents to make this project an international success.  <br/>We have a provisional patent  #2014905170 .</li>
<li>The best way to combat commercial theft is to gain market ascendancy in the first place.  There is an adage in the Intellectual Property “Market dominance goes to those who enter the market first”. Therefore we need to move as quickly as possible. <br/>With your contribution we can enter the market first with a fine product that offers significant social benefits at a reasonable price.  <br/>We have a detailed Marketing Plan in place with extensive marketing strategies, based on the originators’ experience and research. One of the strategies for non-English-speaking countries is to joint venture with women’s anti-violence charities.</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><ul> </ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p> </p><p></p>
<p>Andrew and Roger will be marketing the
DrinkGuardian via the Net including Facebook, Youtube and other social
media, as well as direct response television advertising .<span>  You can make all the difference
by mentioning the DrinkGuardian anti-drink-spiking device on your web pages,
blog and Facebook page Twitter and other social media, and sharing with your friends. Your help is invaluable to spread the word
that young women deserve to be able to go out, have a drink and a dance, safely.  After all, you and they deserve to have a

the outcome could have been dire.  She
was lucky, but this incident prompted me to research the subject. I was
staggered to find the seriousness and extent of this criminal and sexually
motivated crime.  I imagined a definitive
solution to the problem and asked Andrew Goodall to build what is now the DrinkGuardian
anti-drink-spiking device, and to make it inexpensive to make it available at a
reasonable price.
This funding campaign, with your help, will enable Andrew and Roger to finalise the creation of a new and highly technical component, and allow them to get the product manufactured for sale, initially in Australia and internationally.
The provisional patent number is 2014905170.
This is a socially important product that effectively stops drink spiking from happening in the first place and in the rare instance where someone may try to tamper with a glass protected with a DrinkGuardian the offender will be identified immediately.  
DrinkGuardian  is low cost, reusable, and rechargeable and has the potential to save lives while ensuring the safety of its user in any situation where alcoholic drinks are consumed. The device addresses all problems connected to drink spiking. It is battery operated (long-life and re-chargable), inexpensive, portable, stylish simple and foolproof and will appeal to younger women, their parents and husbands who are concerned with safety.The user simply places the DrinkGuardian  on the top of the glass. After switching on the device it will be in the ready mode via radio signal, from a transmitter worn on the wrist or placed in a handbag etc much like a close range garage door opener. The display shows green. The flashing red and blue lights activate when touched by anyone other than the user. It is obvious that no perpetrator would dare to be seen or heard tampering with a drink protected by DrinkGuardian in a public place. THEY WILL BE CAUGHT.
Drink spiking is a serious crime against women, the object of which is at best robbery and at worst rape or even murder. Your contribution will go a long way to ensuring women will be protected from the criminals who place drugs in  drinks in a social situation.Drink spiking is typically perpetrated against young women in socially vulnerable situations where alcohol is served. The end result is at best, sexual abuse, with rape as the objective. Many cases result in murder.  It has been estimated this sexual abuse is happening on a vast scale, some estimates are in the millions annually worldwide. In the extreme, drink spiking is often the starting point for obtaining women for the sexual slave trade.In the extreme, drink spiking is often the starting point for obtaining women for the global sexual slave trade.Unfortunately the authorities around the world have difficulty in their estimates simply because in many cases the victim does not know what actually happened, Such is the effect of several date rape drugs including Rohypnol. In many other cases the victims are under the impression they got carried away emotionally while drunk, and sadly come out of the incident with a feeling of guilt. Naturally this is not true.  It is not their fault! In other instances the victim is too embarassed to report the rape or sexual assault. It is well known that the perpetrators of this heinous behaviour often hide behind the uncertainty or embassesment of the victims and the devestating effect the episode has on them.The team at DrinkGuardian believe all people deserve to have their night out in safety away from these criminals and the appalling acts they commit. Up till now the actual capture of the perpetrators has been very difficult because the perpetrator has to be seen to actually tamper with the drink to be charged with that offense.  DrinkGuardian  not only makes it impossible to contaminate a drink when in use but the perpetrator will be SEEN to be trying to place drugs in the drink. No other drink spiking system is able to do this,. This ensures the completeness of the DrinkGuardian  approach to this terrible practice. (Provisional Patent  #2014905170)  
 What We Need & What You Get 
We are seeking fifty thousand dollars.  This will ensure the final vigorous testing and accreditation will be completed and initial production, release and distribution of the DrinkGuardian anti-drink-spiking device will be carried out.

As part of our fund raising campaign and in appreciation of your contribution of one hundred and fifty dollars or more we will send you a complimentary DrinkGuardian anti-drink-spiking device free of charge as a thank you gesture.  We are also considering setting up an affiliate program. When the DrinkGuardian is available for sale, it is anticipated the recommended retail price will be only $69.95 Au (or equivalent USD)
 If we do not reach our goal of fifty thousand dollars we will continue to look for ways to fund our dream using the money you have entrusted to us.  We will be able to start with less but naturally it is better to have an initial starting point adequate to provide the best reach for the DrinkGuardian anti-drink-spiking device.
The provisional patent number is 2014905170, and DrinkGuardian is trademarked. 
    The Impact 
The DrinkGuardian project is unique in that we are producing a product which will actually prevent drink spiking from happening.  There are other protective systems and while they can detect drugs already in the drink they don't stop drink spiking from happening in the first place.  DrinkGuardian is unique in that it has the potential to actually stop the criminal practice of drink spiking in its tracks.Drink spiking is at best an attempt to rob and/or rape, and tragically young women have been murdered after drink spiking. On occasions drink spiking has been known to be the first step in slave trading of women for prostitution. Drink spiking is prevalent in most of the western world.  Police from many countries have been frustrated in their attempts to successfully charge and bring to just the perpetrators, as it has been almost impossible to detect a drink spiking incident, which is one crime, and then connect it to the robbery or sexual assault that follows.  Our product identifies the perpetrator instantly,
    Risks & Challenges  This is an entirely new product which has never been seen before, and people may compare it with other products on the market. It will be vital to explain why this is a far better and more effective product, and what makes it unique.  The idea can be stolen in this early stage and inferior imitations produced if we do not get the funding to manufacture quickly enough. 
In marketing and promoting this brand new product we will need to explain that whilst all other products currently on the market only detect the presence of drugs in the drink after the event, our product is unique in that it will actually prevents the drink spiking and also identifies the perpetrator if he even touches the DrinkGuardian. 
Andrew's innovative technical expertise allows the DrinkGuardian product to go into the manufacturing as a fully tested and long lasting product.  Roger's understanding of marketing process and understanding of charitable endeavours  provide a unique blend of talents to make this project an international success.  We have a provisional patent  #2014905170 .
The best way to combat commercial theft is to gain market ascendancy in the first place.  There is an adage in the Intellectual Property “Market dominance goes to those who enter the market first”. Therefore we need to move as quickly as possible. With your contribution we can enter the market first with a fine product that offers significant social benefits at a reasonable price.  We have a detailed Marketing Plan in place with extensive marketing strategies, based on the originators’ experience and research. One of the strategies for non-English-speaking countries is to joint venture with women’s anti-violence charities.
    Other Ways You Can Help 
Andrew and Roger will be marketing the
DrinkGuardian via the Net including Facebook, Youtube and other social
media, as well as direct response television advertising .  You can make all the difference
by mentioning the DrinkGuardian anti-drink-spiking device on your web pages,
blog and Facebook page Twitter and other social media, and sharing with your friends. Your help is invaluable to spread the word
that young women deserve to be able to go out, have a drink and a dance, safely.  After all, you and they deserve to have a
safe night out.

<p>The insole represents the ultimate Bio-Feedback experience: </p>
<p>Cork Base: Form-Stable Design - instead of using the usual polyethylene, stappone’s base is made of high-quality cork; besides being an ecology friendly material, it is also both form-stable and cushioning, so it keeps its form under pressure of up to 1.25 tons and still remains comfortable and flexible. The cork base also houses and protects stappone’s processing center. </p>
<p>Textile sensors - stappone’s middle layer collects information about your posture, distribution of weight, and movement, in any situation (and we mean any situation). It can detect the smallest shifts in weight and limitations in movement. </p>
<p>CoolMax® cover - The top layer is made of high-quality CoolMax® fabric, which is both super-comfortable and conductive. It is the perfect surface to read your unique footprint.</p>

</div></div>","stappone constructs a multidimensional view of your foot and body. The longer you use it, the more precise it becomes. Try it.

 

Sometimes the key to feeling healthier and more energised during the day is a small change in your posture or movement. For example, sitting too long (especially with bad posture) may lead to pinched nerves and increased fatigue. stappone recognises these bad posture habits and helps you correct them:  
Fatigue
Back pain
Foot and neck pain
Restricted movement
Foot deformities
Misalignment of the spine
Musculoskeletal weakness

 

stappone’s smart textile insole has GPS sensors, accelerometers, and location trackers that collect immense amounts of information:  
Weight
Calorie Burn
Skeletal Deformities (yes, through your feet!)
Posture Activity - running, walking, sitting, riding a bike - even taking the elevator



 


 ""Regular and long-term gait tracking contributes to creating a coherent data profile of activities and in this context health. This helps both in the prevention of inappropriate biomechanical stress as well as the diagnosis of abnormalities"".

 ""The stappone insole with its accurate and long enduring textile sensors is a leading high-tech innovation. It shows that our region Vorarlberg is on the right track to becoming the textile silicon valley. We are proud to call stAPPtronics GmbH a valued member of our platform"".

 ""Physical activity is considered a highly effective measure against several kinds of diseases. You do not need to achieve top athletic performance to prevent cardiovascular diseases. It’s the small things that help best - even the daily walk to the office has an effective preventive function.""
 

stappone’s app takes the incredible amount of information that is recorded by the insole and translates it into an interface that’s understandable, helpful, and easy-to-use.


We have developed stappone primarily to prevent pain, injuries and common diseases. Furthermore, your stappBuddy will let you know if there might be possible problems that maybe a doctor should take a look at. The app also allows you to share your data, such as gait patterns, exercise activities, etc. for a period of your choosing with your doctor. By providing your doctor with better data for his diagnosis, it will allow for a more accurate diagnosis and may therefore recommend a more targeted treatment.

 

Simply being told you haven’t moved enough today is no help. 
stappone’s virtual support system recognizes the right time to suggest precise advice, based on your unique body blueprint, on how to promote your posture and health. No pressure to perform, just useful information at the right time. stappone measures your progress and motivates you by granting Activity Points for the different forms of activity you perform throughout the day.

 

DISCREET  Not everyone has to know that you’re counting steps or monitoring your health. stappone does everything from within your shoes, so you have full discretion.  
PRIVATE We care about your privacy. The information collected by stappone stays yours and only yours, and will never be traded, for any reason unless explicitly approved by you.   
AND SAFEWe tested stappone from every possible angle to ensure that it is safe to use, and complies with all the strictest quality-control standards, so you can enjoy your stappone without worrying about safety issues.

 

Unlike most fitness trackers, stappone doesn’t have to be connected to your phone in order to work. Need some privacy? Your phone died in the middle of a week-long hike in the woods? No worries. The insoles will continue recording your performance. Once you reconnect with your phone, stappone will sync everything so you don’t lose anything. stappone can even continue tracking your location without draining your phones battery and data plan.

 

Every package comes with two wireless charges which can work with your phone or tablet too. To charge your insoles, simply place stappone’s wireless chargers on your insoles. Simple as that.

 

 

 
The insole represents the ultimate Bio-Feedback experience: 
Cork Base: Form-Stable Design - instead of using the usual polyethylene, stappone’s base is made of high-quality cork; besides being an ecology friendly material, it is also both form-stable and cushioning, so it keeps its form under pressure of up to 1.25 tons and still remains comfortable and flexible. The cork base also houses and protects stappone’s processing center. 
Textile sensors - stappone’s middle layer collects information about your posture, distribution of weight, and movement, in any situation (and we mean any situation). It can detect the smallest shifts in weight and limitations in movement. 
CoolMax® cover - The top layer is made of high-quality CoolMax® fabric, which is both super-comfortable and conductive. It is the perfect surface to read your unique footprint.

<p>Have you ever wondered how the super HD quality works on your television? That exact same technology was applied in our very own VoGuard filters. VoGuard wanted to make the filter as effective as possible by creating micro holes in polyester films—so users can be protected and breathe freely at the same time.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Vault Creation used its technology to be the first in the world to etch 5 μm holes on a PET film—a material safe enough to be used in food packaging. Unlike typical masks that uses static electricity to filter, VoGuard blocks any particles that are larger than 5 μm including droplets that carry harmful particles. </p>

</div></div>","We are living in a world where masks have become mandated in most public areas. They not only protect us, but it also protects our loved ones and the public. Unfortunately, masks are not always easy to wear frequently. They can become uncomfortable, stuffy, damp and unsanitary. People have even expressed feelings of lightheadedness and migraines due to the restricted airflow.
 
VoGuard Droplet Blocking Test

 
VoGuard Particle Filtration Efficiency Test

 
 
 
We’ve noticed that disposable masks are…

Have you ever wondered how the super HD quality works on your television? That exact same technology was applied in our very own VoGuard filters. VoGuard wanted to make the filter as effective as possible by creating micro holes in polyester films—so users can be protected and breathe freely at the same time.
 


After continuous testing, Vault Creation was able to invent the Advanced Plasma Machine and etch micro-sized holes through its PATENTED invention.
 

Vault Creation used its technology to be the first in the world to etch 5 μm holes on a PET film—a material safe enough to be used in food packaging. Unlike typical masks that uses static electricity to filter, VoGuard blocks any particles that are larger than 5 μm including droplets that carry harmful particles. 
 
 



An accredited testing center based in Japan called KAKEN tested and proved that the filter in VoGuard blocked 99.9% of pollen.
 


This experiment is showing that VoGuard was able to block a majority of the fine dust, even with the extremely high air pressure—a notable result to consider from the experiment.
 
 

 


The filter allows free air flow. Even with the mask on, you can breathe comfortably. 
 

Compared to most masks which use three layers of filter, VoGuard only uses one layer of filter, making air easier to pass through.
 
The Testing & Research Institute performed numerous tests and experiments to prove the science behind this unique filter technology. The results show that VoGuard offers THREE TIMES MORE breathability than masks with melt blown filters.

       Melt Blown Filter Breathability: 349           /            VoGuard Filter Breathability: 1073.6
 

The Breathability Experiment shows that VoGuard allowed the most air flow when air was blown through the filters with an air compressor. 
 
 

VoGuard is washable, and you can easily clean it on the go.

Melt blown filters and cloth masks are classified as disposable because they can be easily contaminated. VoGuard is made from medical-grade PVC (safe for your skin), making it easy to clean with water and wipes. If you’re in a rush, it can even be sanitized with wipes.
 

The filters are polyester film perforated with 5 μm holes by the Advanced Plasma Machine. It is washable with water, sanitizing wipe or spray to be kept clean and sanitized.
 

 
 
 

You can save up to $329 per year by not purchasing disposable masks regularly. 

VoGuard was designed to be used semi-permanently so you don’t have to worry about hoarding all those disposable masks. We do recommend, however, that you switch out the filter every six months for sanitary purposes.
 
 

By using VoGuard, you are playing an important role in protecting the environment from additional pollution.

It helps reduce waste going into the environment with its cutting-edge reusable design. 
 

 

 
 
 

VoGuard is versatile and easy to take with you because it can be folded without being crumpled and destroyed.

It can even be washed on the go with sanitizer or wipes. You can carry it around anywhere!

The Global Problem of Air Pollution

 
 
Outdoor air pollution is a major cause of death and disease globally. The health effects range from increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits, to increased risk of premature death. 

Our Technology: Key Benefits


 MOF starting materials are inexpensive and degrade much faster than polymers, reducing the waste and additional plastic pollution accumulation.
By using MOFs in combination with natural fibers, such as cotton, hemp and bamboo, we are offering an alternative to the synthetic and sterile-looking products typically offered.
MOFs have the potential to capture harmful gas pollutants such as SOx and NOx that frequently accompany particulate matter emissions from combustion processes.


A Social Enterprise

Most air masks available for purchase are made from polymers, but these masks cannot be easily produced cheaply, hence the high ( > $ 1/mask) retail prices. Masks made from clothing fabrics are also available, but they don't effectively capture pollutants and gases.
