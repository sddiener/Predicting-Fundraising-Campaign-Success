<p><strong><i>Kamen America, Volume 3</i></strong>, continues the saga of our heroine as she pursues the identify of her arch nemesis. <strong>Charlotte Vanders</strong> is a fashionista-turned-reluctant hero who must balance her rising stardom against a world whose principles run contrary to her own: and that's on top of her equally super-human rivals who want to take her down a notch!</p>

<p>A sleeper independent hit that debuted in the spring of 2020, <strong>Kamen America</strong> has grossed more than $150,000 between 2 volumes and 2 platforms and is the flagship character of the imprint company <strong>Iconic Comics</strong>. It has since appeared on store shelves in a shortened form courtesy of independent publishing company <strong>Antarctic Press</strong>.</p>
<p>When we last left off in Volume 2, the <strong>Kamen Corps</strong> was squaring away with the triple threat of Machiavellian agent <strong>Niro Lansky</strong>, the mud-manipulating <strong>Vermillion Masquerade</strong>, and the arrogant, armored <strong>Kamen U.N.</strong> Having successfully teamed up to defeat the rampaging kaiju O-Scar, the Kamen Corps sets their eyes on expanding their grassroots support while looking for a way to take down Vermillion Masquerade for good!</p>

</div></div>","Kamen America, Volume 3, continues the saga of our heroine as she pursues the identify of her arch nemesis. Charlotte Vanders is a fashionista-turned-reluctant hero who must balance her rising stardom against a world whose principles run contrary to her own: and that's on top of her equally super-human rivals who want to take her down a notch!

Created by Timothy Lim and Mark Pellegrini 
Art, colors, and lettering by Timothy Lim
Written by Mark Pellegrini
First published by Iconic Comics 
Made and Printed in the USA

A sleeper independent hit that debuted in the spring of 2020, Kamen America has grossed more than $150,000 between 2 volumes and 2 platforms and is the flagship character of the imprint company Iconic Comics. It has since appeared on store shelves in a shortened form courtesy of independent publishing company Antarctic Press.
When we last left off in Volume 2, the Kamen Corps was squaring away with the triple threat of Machiavellian agent Niro Lansky, the mud-manipulating Vermillion Masquerade, and the arrogant, armored Kamen U.N. Having successfully teamed up to defeat the rampaging kaiju O-Scar, the Kamen Corps sets their eyes on expanding their grassroots support while looking for a way to take down Vermillion Masquerade for good!




Vermillion Masquerade, Lansky and Kamen U.N. form an alliance in a final bid to ruin the Kamen Corps for good! But an unexpected ally comes to their rescue at the last minute-- will Kamen America and her newfound friends save the day and uncover the secret of Vermillion? And who will emerge victorious in the final showdown between Kamen America and Kamen U.N? Find out in the latest volume of the Kamen America saga!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello. My name is Rob Shaffer. I am a long-time fantasy illustrator. I have done work with both large and small press roleplaying companies and have completed concept work for video games.</p><p>This book is a passion project for me. When I was younger, I played tabletop roleplaying games. Many of these games had amazing books about the monsters and denizens of fantasy worlds. They mostly were printed in black and white.

My name is Rob Shaffer. I am a long-time fantasy illustrator. I have done work with both large and small press roleplaying companies and have completed concept work for video games.This book is a passion project for me. When I was younger, I played tabletop roleplaying games. Many of these games had amazing books about the monsters and denizens of fantasy worlds. They mostly were printed in black and white. As a younger person, I used to draw and color the pictures from those books. The art taught me a lot about drawing and creating my own creatures. Eventually, this became one of the many important influences in my art journey. I want to replicate that experience for others with this book.

<h3>A Matter of Survival</h3>
<p>Foreign Agent is a 190 page graphic novel for teens and adults that follows two soldiers who force their way into a home.  There is a language barrier between the soldiers and the family that lives there.  They begin exchanging drawings in an attempt to communicate.  At this point the comic becomes a comic-within-a-comic, and I have 'cast' collaborators A.O.M. and Wayward Nerd to represent the art of the characters within the story.  </p>
<p>The nature of the relationships within the family, as well as the soldiers, isn't clear.  Tension mounts.  Communication is key, and all they have are drawings to exchange.  The soldiers are running from something.  Will their shaky deal with the family pan out or make things worse?</p>
<p>This book is a full affecting graphic novel, 190 pages.  It's already completely drawn.  Funding goes towards a print run and production on future releases from Narwhal Books, including Earthbound, part 2.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Foreign Agent is a very special book.  It's really intense, and only takes place in one house.  Comics don't have to do that, they can do whatever they want.  They can have a spaceship or a dragon come down.  The fact Foreign Agent is so focused and tense is part of the originality and fun that make it stand out. </p>
<p>I've been working on this book over the past three years.  I used to sometimes get adrenaline rushes when I was working on it at certain moments in the story, just anticipating the moment of it's release and a first-time reader's experience.  Very glad that moment has come!  Thanks for checking it out.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This will be my second big campaign!  It's actually my fifth campaign total.  I did several small ones before the previous Earthbound campaign.  So i know the ropes pretty good and can improve on that one.  However I'm still nervous enough about the whole process to the be extra careful and treat it with great respect.  Running an indiegogo is a big life changer.  Even just packing and shipping books is a big endeavor.  However, I've done it all, on a pretty big scale because Earthbound sold over 600 copies, so I'm ready!  I call it the Peter Simeti LIFE holla atcha boi</p>

A Matter of Survival
Foreign Agent is a 190 page graphic novel for teens and adults that follows two soldiers who force their way into a home.  There is a language barrier between the soldiers and the family that lives there.  They begin exchanging drawings in an attempt to communicate.  At this point the comic becomes a comic-within-a-comic, and I have 'cast' collaborators A.O.M. and Wayward Nerd to represent the art of the characters within the story.  
The nature of the relationships within the family, as well as the soldiers, isn't clear.  Tension mounts.  Communication is key, and all they have are drawings to exchange.  The soldiers are running from something.  Will their shaky deal with the family pan out or make things worse?
This book is a full affecting graphic novel, 190 pages.  It's already completely drawn.  Funding goes towards a print run and production on future releases from Narwhal Books, including Earthbound, part 2.
 
""Foreign Agent is so f*cking good.  It's like a good foreign film I can't turn off."" - Von Klaus, creator of Monster M.D.
 


 

 
A focus on Perks
This campaign offers a softcover, a hardcover, and a sketchbook in any combination.  The sketchbook continues the installments of the sketchbook from the Earthbound campaign.  Including Nosferatu pt. 2, a full 20 page comic, and The Naked Samurai shorts.  
The Bundle tier will recieve all three items as well as a Special Thanks in the book and a sketch on the inside cover of the Hardcover book.

<p><a href=""https://igg.me/at/GaryShipman/x/18833604"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hello, welcome to my first Indiegogo campaign.  My name is Gary Shipman, and I have been making art for 30 years working on comics, movies and other properties. I'm probably best known for my comic book series <i><strong>Pakkins' Land</strong></i> that was nominated for <strong>Eisner</strong>, <strong>Harvey</strong>, and <strong>Russ Manning Awards</strong>. My work has been published through <strong>Disney Publishing</strong>, <strong>Caliber Press</strong>, <strong>Image Comics</strong>, <strong>Alias Comics</strong>, <strong>Cryptozoic</strong>, and <strong>Zondervan</strong>. I have been exploring different styles of art throughout my adult life, with no formal art training. My wife Rhoda and I have beed married for 30 years and have 3  beautiful children.<br/><br/>I'm just an artist trying to share a little beauty where I can. You are the biggest part of what I do, my expression in art means nothing without your contribution. I do what I do for you.</a></p>

Cover by Billy Tucci</p><p><strong>There I was…</strong></p><p>Armed with a portfolio holding the very pages in this book and storming the floor of the 1993 Comic Con International in San Diego…</p><p>I was anxious.  I knew no one, but even though my heart was pounding through my chest at this “one shot” at comic book fame, I held a strong conviction that I could somehow scratch out a living in this fantastically creative industry.  Like many a budding cartoonist at this biggest of all conventions, I stood in long lines and when it was my turn to show my wares, opened my book hoping the bored and hung-over editor would awake from his stupor and look up at me wide-eyed like he’d just made a great discovery… And offer me a job.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">STRETCH GOALS!!!! (Distributed per Backer)</p><p>Problem was, that aside from Lady Death creator, Brian Pulido (who graciously offered me a pin up), no one was interested.  From the “Big Two” all the way down to the smallest of publishers, all turned me down -- every single one of them. To say I was heartbroken would be a callous understatement, but I was undeterred.  I remember thinking to myself, on that long flight back home to New York, about a life of illustrating licensing products, or even going back to designing children’s wear.  Perhaps I could go back to the National Guard.   Either way, I had to do something as I was incredibly broke and way behind in my rent.</p><p>I put on my Sony “discman” (remember those?) and removed the portfolio from the aircraft’s overhead storage bin.  Listening to Kitaro’s Kojiki, (which was the soundtrack I crafted up the “Way of the Warrior” story arc) I began thumbing through the book, critiquing each and every panel and determining which pages were good and which had to be redone.  My mindset was one of defiance as my train of thought was  “I’m not going to forget these pages and come back in six months with new material” like I had been instructed by the editors.  I will keep them, improve upon them and move forward with “my story”… the story of Ana Ishikawa and her monogatari titled, “Shi.” I was going to self-publish comic books.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573574793/uaycpdxqjuoivgqsl9uq.jpg"" src=""""/>Billy Tucci - Creator</p><p>And that, pretty much, is how it all started.  Of course the next six months were utterly painful, but so exciting, as I delved into researching - just how in the hell does one “self-publish?”  This was before the internet, so I hit every library, read every book andbothered every retailer who would speak to me, trying to figure out just how to do this.  All the while, I worked freelance design by day and sharpened the Shi pages by night.   I “employed” two great friends, co-writer Peter Gutierrez and designer Barry Orkin, with my ever-suffering wife (then ever-suffering girlfriend), Deborah to refine the script and define the artwork.  There was much aggravation, missteps, late hours and fear – at one point I almost sold half the creation to a pair of predatory business “partners”, but that’s a story for a different day. There were also triumphs -- none so gratifying as March 23, 1994 – the day, “Shi – The Way of the Warrior #1” shipped to comic shops across North America and Europe, making the anxious drama that seemed to daunt its creation every step of the way all well worth it.</p><p>As they say, from that day forward, things have never been the same.  And it’s all because of my friends, family, retailers and most of all, you – the reader.  Especially those of you who, for some reason or another, chose my book among hundreds that day in 1994, and for that I am forever grateful.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573574833/r61m4wgcanahiwqeholc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">SHI: Way of the Warrior #1, 1994</p><p>So join us for the first new Shi graphic novel in 15 years ...

(For all physically shipping pledges!)**Some stretch goals rewards might vary if backer pledged after August 1, 2020BILLY TUCCI'S ORIGINAL COVER ""SHI'S BACK!"" COVER ARTWORK!SHI’s BACK! Cover by Billy TucciThere I was…Armed with a portfolio holding the very pages in this book and storming the floor of the 1993 Comic Con International in San Diego…I was anxious.  I knew no one, but even though my heart was pounding through my chest at this “one shot” at comic book fame, I held a strong conviction that I could somehow scratch out a living in this fantastically creative industry.  Like many a budding cartoonist at this biggest of all conventions, I stood in long lines and when it was my turn to show my wares, opened my book hoping the bored and hung-over editor would awake from his stupor and look up at me wide-eyed like he’d just made a great discovery… And offer me a job. STRETCH GOALS!!!! (Distributed per Backer)Problem was, that aside from Lady Death creator, Brian Pulido (who graciously offered me a pin up), no one was interested.  From the “Big Two” all the way down to the smallest of publishers, all turned me down -- every single one of them. To say I was heartbroken would be a callous understatement, but I was undeterred.  I remember thinking to myself, on that long flight back home to New York, about a life of illustrating licensing products, or even going back to designing children’s wear.  Perhaps I could go back to the National Guard.   Either way, I had to do something as I was incredibly broke and way behind in my rent.I put on my Sony “discman” (remember those?) and removed the portfolio from the aircraft’s overhead storage bin.  Listening to Kitaro’s Kojiki, (which was the soundtrack I crafted up the “Way of the Warrior” story arc) I began thumbing through the book, critiquing each and every panel and determining which pages were good and which had to be redone.  My mindset was one of defiance as my train of thought was  “I’m not going to forget these pages and come back in six months with new material” like I had been instructed by the editors.  I will keep them, improve upon them and move forward with “my story”… the story of Ana Ishikawa and her monogatari titled, “Shi.” I was going to self-publish comic books.Billy Tucci - CreatorAnd that, pretty much, is how it all started.  Of course the next six months were utterly painful, but so exciting, as I delved into researching - just how in the hell does one “self-publish?”  This was before the internet, so I hit every library, read every book andbothered every retailer who would speak to me, trying to figure out just how to do this.  All the while, I worked freelance design by day and sharpened the Shi pages by night.   I “employed” two great friends, co-writer Peter Gutierrez and designer Barry Orkin, with my ever-suffering wife (then ever-suffering girlfriend), Deborah to refine the script and define the artwork.  There was much aggravation, missteps, late hours and fear – at one point I almost sold half the creation to a pair of predatory business “partners”, but that’s a story for a different day. There were also triumphs -- none so gratifying as March 23, 1994 – the day, “Shi – The Way of the Warrior #1” shipped to comic shops across North America and Europe, making the anxious drama that seemed to daunt its creation every step of the way all well worth it.As they say, from that day forward, things have never been the same.  And it’s all because of my friends, family, retailers and most of all, you – the reader.  Especially those of you who, for some reason or another, chose my book among hundreds that day in 1994, and for that I am forever grateful.  SHI: Way of the Warrior #1, 1994So join us for the first new Shi graphic novel in 15 years ... A story in which a comic book character has grown up in real time. .. A story that is literally 25 years in the making and one we hope you will love reading as much as we have loved making.Thank you… #SHISBACK!Billy TucciSHI’S BACK!!!!Billy Tucci’s SHI: Amazing Spider-Man #301 Homage Cover Crusade Comics is so excited to bring you the debut crowdfunding campaign for our all new 48-page graphic novel Shi: Return of the Warrior!Nigen-Sei Cover by Billy TucciIn this story over a quarter century in the making we now find our heroine Ana Ishikawa 15 years removed from when she last graced the pages of a comic book.

Ny bokserie på Nosebleed Studio! Vi följer fyra tjejer som gör sig redo att installera nyaste expansionen på deras favorit-onlinespel. Men åh vad lång tid det tar att ladda ner allt ... Och när de vaknar upp på morgonen har spelets monster tagit sig in i verkligheten?!
En vackert tecknad serie om Gamer Girls i fullfärg! 

En perfekt bok för den där spelnörden du känner – eller kanske är det dig själv?
 
Nosebleed Studio lär dig teckna manga – Karaktärsdesign, nyutgåva med 52 extra sidor

Vår extremt populära lär dig teckna-bok är tillbaka – nu med ännu fler sidor och uppdaterade bilder! Du får ett ännu större referensbibliotek på kläder, poser, frisyrer, ögon och mer! Många av bilderna är nya, och en hel del sidor har fått extra bilder.
Dessutom har vi nu lagt in ännu mer djupgående instruktioner kring hur man ritar sådant som öron, ögonfransar, muskler, anatomi, och mer. De allra svåraste bitarna har fått ännu mer lätta förklaringar, så att nybörjaren får en ännu lättare introduktion. Samtidigt har vi lagt till nytt i de svårare områdena också – så oavsett vilken nivå du är på kommer du att upptäcka något nytt!

Om jag redan har den första utgåvan av boken, varför ska jag köpa denna? Den första utgåvan är också bra fortfarande, men denna nya har så mycket mer. 52 sidor är ordentligt mycket mer! Om det fanns något du hade svårt att förstå i förra utgåvan är det mycket möjligt att vi har utvecklat det i denna. Varför inte ge din gamla bok till någon du känner och köpa denna för att bli en ännu bättre mangatecknare?

<p><strong>A bit about me; A lot about Fear</strong></p>
<p>Always striving to create and innovate during my artistic career, I created and launched <strong>zombieportraits.com</strong> in 2006. In the years since, I have ‘zombified’ <strong>over 10,000</strong> people around the world. That endeavour reinforced in me what I had already believed...With passion, integrity, and motivation you can accomplish some pretty amazing things! That is why this project is fully completed and ready to come to life in print ready to be embraced by <strong>YOU</strong>, the fans I adore, and hold so dear to my heart. And so, I am reaching out via crowdfunding for your help, and support on this artistic journey! By backing this campaign, <strong>YOU WIELD the POWER to bring FEAR to LIFE... If you DARE!!!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Scared is what you're feeling. Brave is what you are doing!"" - Emma Donogue</i></p>
<h3><strong>Rob Sacchetto's Cape Fear: An Introduction to Fear and Other Stories</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign's primary focus is on the <strong>newly compiled 48-page Prequel</strong>, to my first Graphic Novel, <strong>Cape Fear: Power Struggle</strong>, originally printed through a crowdfunding campaign in 2011.</p>
<p>This compilation of short stories demonstrates Fear's power, and the <strong>HUGE </strong>role, this God plays in our lives... From cradle to grave!</p>
<p>Follow a child's journey through Fear, as He lurks around every corner, in <strong>'The Route'</strong>.</p>
<p>Witness the futility of trying to master the God of Fear, in this modern day fable, <strong>'In Fear'</strong>.</p>
<p>Understand there is no escape from the fate Fear assigns to you, as a man is confronted by his alter-ego in<strong> 'A Monster's Tale'</strong>.</p>
<p>Watch in horror, as Fear creates a cavalcade of chaos, turning a hero into a killer in<strong> </strong>this wartime 'EC'-style, short, <strong>'Fearless Franky'</strong>. </p>
<p>So, if you are a fan of anthologies, this is the comic for you. Four different stories, each done in a unique artistic style, written, drawn and even lettered by me. I wore every hat on this project and pride myself on my continued learning and growing in my field. </p>
<h3><strong>Rob Sacchetto's Cape Fear: Power Struggle 2nd Print Edition</strong></h3>
<p>A long, long time ago, I wrote and illustrated what was going to be a four issue comic book mini-series. From there, I compiled this complete and complex story into one incredible 150-page Graphic Novel. Since its first print release, a decade ago,  every time I read that version, I had a desire to do some fine tuning to the overall design, and the lettering. </p>
<p>When I decided to reprint Power Struggle to offer it along with the Prequel for those who had missed out, I figured that now was the time. Enter Andrea Sacchetto, to edit comic script, and revamp the lettering, to make this improved version!</p>
<p>So, to sum it up, on this project, I have worn almost every hat, and whether to get credit or blame, I feel this is <strong>my absolute best</strong> effort in all creative aspects of<strong> building a better comic!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>How do we make this happen?!</strong></h3>
<p>From print costs for each book, including shipping from the manufacturer to me, to the cost of packaging, print costs for the Limited, Number, Signed and Laminated poster,  your contribution to this campaign ensure that we are able to get high quality products made, and delivered to your doorstep in a timely manner! </p>
<h3>What about those Perks?!</h3>
<p>Well, the most exciting thing about what you get, is that every single product, and piece of art has been envisioned and created by me. Every concept, every line, every character and creature you encounter are unique to the art style I have spent decades honing. </p>
<p>You not only get a one-time only Cape Fear poster, but you can also get an original sketch of mine on card stock, an original full page illustration INSIDE the Graphic Novel, a one of a kind, hand painted Zombie Portrait, by yours truly, or one of five ACTUAL art pages, that are part of the Cape Fear: Power Struggle book! </p>
<p>AND, with conventions not up in swing yet, I will be autographing each piece that is sent out, as a Special thank you, and I MISS  YOU ALL!!! </p>
<h3>The way I do the things I do!</h3>
<p>Well, if there is one unchanging truth about me and my work, I have never missed a deadline, nor folded on a funded project! In the past 15 years as a working artist, I launched an online business; zombieportraits.com, where my 'army of undead' Zombified fans now number over 10,000 customers worldwide!! To keep busy in my 'downtime', I have Zombiedaily.com, where, yep, I post a new Zombie drawing or painting daily since 2008. My work has been featured on  many products, and I have had two of my books published on a mass scale. Throughout the years, I have successfully funded Cape Fear Graphic Novel, Zombie Pin-Up Girls, Vol 1&amp;2, Color this!, an adult Coloring book, and in 2019, the 'Color by Nature,' Calendar.</p>

<h2><strong>The Inception!</strong></h2>
<p>     I’m really exited because I’ve been wanting to get this book published through Image Comics for a long time now. It’s been a journey. It all started when I wrote my book in 2017, the tail end of that summer. At the time, I was depressed because my mom started going through dialysis and she was not doing well. I thought she was going pass (thankfully, she’s still with us). I was going through other stuff too, that summer was not great for me. I felt that a black kid from Washington Heights wasn’t meant to be a writer, I felt defeated, insignificant. Then one bleak day, I was going through the motions, I popped in the Spiderman 2 DVD (Tobey Maguire’s Spiderman) and we know how great the film was, and is. The “Aunt May's motivational speech” scene struck a chord in my brain and that’s when everything I knew and felt started to take shape.</p>
<p>     In the movie, Peter gave up being Spiderman because of his emotional breakdown. It was then I saw the parallels between him and I. We get to the scene where Peter is helping Aunt May pack, and there she delivers her speech about the hero in all of us and what it means I be one. I took what she said to mean when people fall, we learn from it, we grow and get back up (A similar sentiment to what Thomas Wayne says to Bruce in Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>My Debut Comic!</strong></h2>
<p>     After hearing that speech, I was primed with passion again! By the end of that summer I started to write a six-issue comicbook called Napoleon from the Machine. It took me three months to write and a few months of writing workshops to iron out the kinks. I had the scripts but was working a part-time job and couldn’t afford to pay for the illustrations, coloring and lettering. So I shelved the project in hopes I get a chance to one day bring it to life. Years went on and then we were all on lock down. I reached out to an awesome artist, by the name of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/todorhristovartist/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Todor Hristov</a>, about drawing my one-shot called ‘<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VJMZGN8/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My Brother, Teddy</a>’. It is my debut comicbook that I funded out of pocket. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625709837/vy1tot6j2veln9dssrp4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It was through Todor, I virtually met <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sonyaanastasova/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sonya Anastasova</a>, the colorist and then my team was born. Then I added a last minute addition to the team, I decided to add a musical score that gave my comicbook emotional weight. I collaborated with composer <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lbwarecomposer/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lawren Brianna Ware</a> to make that happen. It took time to put together, but I finally released my one-shot back in February 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></h2>
<p>     I was so happy to finally have my book out for the world to see. I was able to put the project together because I had been working full-time for about two years. Fortunately, I was able to produce ‘My Brother, Teddy’, but I knew six issues will be costly to do alone, especially with school loans looming. So that is why I’m asking you backers for your help. For this project, I partnered with Sonya again and her awesome husband <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/konstantin_vitkov_titis/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Konstantin Vitkov-Titis</a>, the author and illustrator to Jack Eridon, a private detective who turns into a demon. This talented team is excited and willing to help my project come to life, and for that, I am grateful to them. As an independent creator, Indiegogo is a chance for me to publish and produce this comic. I hope this is the beginning that will jettison my career so I can achieve my dream as a multifaceted writer in the entertainment world.</p>

<h2><strong>The Story. </strong></h2>
<p>     This project is a Neo-superhero graphic novel takes place in a somewhat near future; the year is 2094, New York City. The story is about the eponymous hero, who is depressed and an alcoholic. Napoleon has the ability to manifest his drawings into reality. Before the story’s present setting, Napoleon had unintentionally created a name for himself. To the world, he’s known as the mysterious being, Kami; a moniker given to him by the Japanese. The story begins four years after the loss of his wife, Maggie, to a terminal illness. In the present, we find Napoleon deep in grief, not using his powers as much as he did at his prime.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625792550/gyvmnxjfkwuficlnjeoy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Napoleon seldom uses his abilities to conjure the Man in Black, one of the caricatures that frequently patrols the neighborhood. Napoleon tries to use his abilities is in an attempt to bring his wife back to life, in which he can’t because his powers don't extend that far. All these years neglecting the world, a global terrorist group, known as Angels, have nearly taken over the entire planet. Their goal is to force the world into a one unified country by any means necessary.</p>

<h2>Setting</h2>
<p>     The world is similar to our reality, in aesthetics. There are larger, pristine buildings in the city akin to Minority Report or Gattaca. The story begins uptown, in Washington Heights.  Unlike downtown, the neighborhood still has old buildings with solar panels installed on rooftops.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625792898/anoq9h9esb2yifawtoyk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As the reader, you’ll see there's more of a focus in the uptown areas including the Bronx. You’ll see most of the neighborhood through the eyes of Angel insurrectionists as the story progresses.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625792955/sy0aocsmiebkwynjrckm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Amie, one of Napoleon’s neighbors, is killed in an attack, leaving her daughter, Justine, behind. After the incident, he finds within himself to tap into what made him special. With a brief sense of responsibility and guilt, Napoleon goes out of his way to protect Justine. Coming out of his melancholy, Napoleon is slowly starting to reclaim a shadow of his former self. Will he use his abilities to save the world or let his grief consume him?</p>

<p> I poured my heart and grief into this story, I hope this book is enough to be a guide anyone who feels defeated or lost. Again, thankfully my mom is still with us and I can’t wait to hand her a copy of Napoleon from the Machine #1. This comic was also a thank you letter to one of my role models, Stan Lee, before he passed. But I believe he’ll see my story from whatever universe he’s in now. But for everyone on Earth-1218, this project is for anyone that feels they are without purpose, or for those that just love comics. I want this book to reignite the fire in you. I hope this first issue generates buzz, and like a domino effect, the other five will follow suit and be in your hands…</p>
<h3>I’m a writer, and my creations are for you! </h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the budget will be going back to fairly compensating the illustrator and colorist, Konstantin and Sonya. If we exceed our goal, the surplus will be used to produce the NAPOLEON FROM THE MACHINE #2 and so on. This is my first Indiegogo campaign and I’m anxious. I have a lot of positive energy aimed to reach our goal! This will be my second comicbook that I publish. I figure if I could put a team together for ‘My Btother, Teddy’ and completed it, we can get this project done too. The script is written and has been edited in full. There is always a risk that work on pages will run slightly behind, but I’ve worked with many artists and Konstantin produces pages on-time and very quickly, exceeding my expectations. If there are any issues I’ll update you all. This is a passion project that will be fully realized. We are all committed to getting this book into your hands.</p>

Multari, but you can call me Rob. It’s been my dream since I was a kid, struggling with Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia, to be in the comic book business. Comic books helped me learn how to deal with my learning disability. When I was 14-years-old, I wrote fan fiction for the X-Men and submitted it to Marvel in hopes that Stan Lee would read it. Someone from Marvel was nice enough to write back to me saying that Stan loves to hear from his fans and encouraged me to keep up my writing. As naive as I was at the time, it spread my passion for the business like a wild fire and inspired me to go to art school at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Applied Media Arts. I have been working on Night Wolf since I was 16-years-old. The story and the characters have grown up with me, evolving into the amazing tale that it is today.</p><p>Why a werewolf comic book? Well, I have always loved any werewolf or supernatural related entertainment in movies, video games, etc. I didn't feel like there were any comic books out there doing werewolves any justice, so I decided to make a comic book based on a werewolf anti-hero myself. In high school, after I started developing Night Wolf, I got into Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a role-playing game by White Wolf Publishing.  I love the artwork in the game guides so much that I longed for them to put out a comic book to build on their world. Unfortunately, it never happened, but the artwork heavily influenced how I like my werewolves should look in my comics.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611871506/urhqx2shgteofzmmfquv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Carlos Herrera is a Professional illustrator residing in Santiago City, Chile.

<h3>Fred Perry's Gold Digger FREDeral Reserve Collection</h3>
<p><i>Fred Perry's Gold Digger</i> is an American Manga/ comic book series that is almost on it's 275th issue! All written and drawn by one man- Fred Perry!</p>
<p>This is a collection of <i>Gold Digge</i>r universe stories that were not in the original run of GD, or reprinted in the collected material. <i>Gold Digger FREDeral Reserve</i> brick is a <strong>700+ page collection</strong> of great standalone and continuity pickup stories.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need to know anything about Gold Digger to enjoy this collection.</strong></p>
<p>Some of it is in color, most is in black and white. Lots of action, drama, romance, comedy, and more.</p>
<p>This collection makes a great jumping-on point for any new readers, as well as awesome reading for longtime fans.</p>
<p><strong>THESE ISSUES HAVE NEVER BEEN COLLECTED INTO ONE VOLUME BEFORE.</strong></p>
<p>Between its black-and-white and full-color issues, the main Gold Digger series is fast approaching the 300-issue mark and is going strong!  (Including material like that being compiled into the <i>FREDeral Reserve</i>, <i>Gold Digger</i> is already well past that milestone!)</p>

A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then. It is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry.

<h3>Why is the story called Brand?</h3>
<p>In the Bible Cain killed his brother Abel. Cain was then cursed and marked by God. The Brand in this case is the ""Mark of Cain"" and part of Cain's burden was to walk the earth and gather warriors to defend the world from the war that's coming. All of these warriors bare the mark of Cain which grants them abilities and protections against the supernatural.</p>

<p>Brand is definitely not a kids book. I'm writing for adults. We play with everything in Brand, particularly the main characters David and Dawn who are, on the surface, polar opposites. David is a nerdy conservative who falls in love with Dawn, who is more liberal and free spirited.

<p>Also, the campaign will stay in <strong>InDemand mode</strong> for at least a few days (and probably until  the comic actually goes on press), so if you'd still like to join us, please do! </p>

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p><strong>Carey McCandless</strong> and <strong>Jessica Williams</strong> are private detectives from two very different walks of life. Each has her own strengths and weaknesses, habits, opinions, convictions, foibles, virtues, and vices. They’re also best friends. If they can’t make it together, it would be a crime.</p>
<p>In fact, it probably will be anyway.</p>

<i>McCandless &amp; Company</i> was one of my first creations. It's the story of Carey McCandless and Jessica Williams, two private investigators from two very different walks of life. Back when I was starting out, we did a one-shot and then a trade paperback with that one-shot, a second one-shot, and a number of short stories and pin-ups. We had lots of great contributors. The only problem was the printing was horrible. Ever since then, I've wanted to get this material back in print so that the contributors could at least say I did them justice in that sense. American Mythology published <i>McCandless &amp; Company: Insecurities</i>, which was the second one-shot. Now <i>McCandless &amp; Company: Crime Scenes</i> will complete the effort.</li>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Manuel Guzman, but my friends and family call me Lolo. I'm an Illustrator/Concept-Artist from New York City and I have always had an affinity for story telling.</p>
<p>Many years ago I began work on these characters and their story, but responsibilities kept me putting it off for another day.

<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<p>This is a flexible campaign, so I will still be able to work with the funds provided even if we don't make the goal. <i>I am finishing this book</i> and if we don't make the goal you will still be getting your rewards. The problem will then be how soon. I was aiming to have the books printed and rewards ready by the Holidays. Without the resources calculated and required that date will have to be moved on to sometime next year. Hopefully, first quarter of 2020.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute to this campaign you can always help by sharing the word on social media. If you like what you see please to tell your friends and family about us and show them the video!</p>

My Story
Hi,
My name is Manuel Guzman, but my friends and family call me Lolo. I'm an Illustrator/Concept-Artist from New York City and I have always had an affinity for story telling.
Many years ago I began work on these characters and their story, but responsibilities kept me putting it off for another day. Every time I was back on the project life would throw a curve ball at me and it would have to go on the back burner again. Now, I am ready to see this thing to the end and happy that at least the extra years have taught me more about art and writing. 
Your contributions will grant me the resources to complete the remaining paintings and to print in the highest quality.

With your support I'll be able to print 500 copies of In Search of Sacha in the highest possible quality and in turn ship them out to you as soon as they are ready. Here I present you with how the funds will be used.

What are the risks?
This is a flexible campaign, so I will still be able to work with the funds provided even if we don't make the goal. I am finishing this book and if we don't make the goal you will still be getting your rewards. The problem will then be how soon. I was aiming to have the books printed and rewards ready by the Holidays. Without the resources calculated and required that date will have to be moved on to sometime next year. Hopefully, first quarter of 2020.

Drawn by the talented Eryck Webb (<i>Ungrounded</i> , <i>TnC Comics</i> and <i>Jumping Boy) </i>and written by Nick Arganbright<i> (Dribble for Kids: Lord of the Sweaters) </i>this loving nod to the original Eastman and Laird TMNT with the love and homage to the pacing of <i>Ultimate Spider-man</i> by Brian Michael Bendis comes <i>Ultimate Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> or UTMNT for short, (found over at <a href=""http://www.utmnt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.utmnt.com</a>) <br/><br/>Clocking in at 44 pages, Issue # 1 of <i>Ultimate Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>
 tells the story of Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo and Raphael as they get 
more than they bargain for during a training mission in ""The Forbidden 
Zone""; a section of the sewers that their father and Master Splinter has
 taught them is dangerous. What lurks in... ""The Forbidden Zone""??<br/><br/>We did a very limited run, but would love to expand and do a second printing of UTMNT Issue # 1. <b>Our goal is to print 50 more books!</b><br/><br/>By supporting this campaign and seeing it funded, you are seeing UTMNT to a second printing of Issue # 1 of <i>Ultimate Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!</i><br/><br/><b>If our campaign is successful we will cover Priority Shipping in the U.S.</b> by the USPS which includes tracking and insurance. <br/><br/><b>There is a $21 shipping charge for anyone outside of the United States</b>.<br/><br/><div>
<p>Once our campaign is successful, we simply need to send the book back to the printers! From there we can get the second printing of Issue # 1 from our hands and place them into yours!<br/></p>We believe we have some decent perks too for those who can 
contribute but the main perk is printing the book itself! We are using the same printer as the first time, which gave us some super amazing books!  Here are some pics of the very, very limited first print run!

 tells the story of Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo and Raphael as they get 
more than they bargain for during a training mission in ""The Forbidden 
Zone""; a section of the sewers that their father and Master Splinter has
 taught them is dangerous. What lurks in... ""The Forbidden Zone""??We did a very limited run, but would love to expand and do a second printing of UTMNT Issue # 1. Our goal is to print 50 more books!By supporting this campaign and seeing it funded, you are seeing UTMNT to a second printing of Issue # 1 of Ultimate Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!If our campaign is successful we will cover Priority Shipping in the U.S. by the USPS which includes tracking and insurance. There is a $21 shipping charge for anyone outside of the United States.
Once our campaign is successful, we simply need to send the book back to the printers! From there we can get the second printing of Issue # 1 from our hands and place them into yours!We believe we have some decent perks too for those who can 
contribute but the main perk is printing the book itself! We are using the same printer as the first time, which gave us some super amazing books!  Here are some pics of the very, very limited first print run!






By helping this project become funded, you secure a print run of 50 copies of Issue # 1 of Ultimate Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

    Death is a moment that is coming for us all, looming just over the horizon, the march of time never to be bartered or bargained with. But in HTD, the impossible becomes possible in an instant. Death comes for the dregs of humanity, but if these listless souls have embraced the abyss of their lives and let go of everything, they will achieve God-like powers through the spark of evolution. The very qualities that dragged them down in life will become weapons to fight back death, but only if they know HOW TO DIE.HOW TO DIE: BIRTH OF THE BLACK ICE is the 28-page first issue in a series about the horrors lurking in the dawn of man's evolution.  
Man needs struggle, and if he can't find war he will shape one within himself.HOW TO DIE is the story of superpowers and preternatual horror. If you enjoy tales of profound strangeness such as Sam Keith's The Maxx or Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, HOW TO DIE is the book to back.HOW TO DIE is... Written by J.P. PlackDrawn by Bogdan RisteaLettered by Federico Corsini CharactersAnthony is just a boy going hunting with his father, wiping the sleep from his eyes as he climbs into his father's pickup. Stopping for a chocolate milk and a coffee. But they aren't tracking a stout buck in the dew-glistened dawn, their prey is man.  Those pathetic amongst us that dangle perilously from the lowest rungs of society.The hunt is a lesson in thinning the herd for the benefit of man, a skill passed down from father to son, the learning of a trade weaved through the family for generations.But this generation will bring something new, a child nurtured in unimaginable pain that rages like a soul on fire. His hunt will be like no other when he uncovers the power that lurks in the depravity of man and he is reborn as the Black Ice.  Bishop’s murder draws closer like darkness swallowing the horizon. He manages a video store, screws, eats take-out and watches movies. He is treading water, going perfectly nowhere, and clinging to what can barely be called life.He knows this, so when the hull of this lifestyle is breached by looming unemployment, he chooses to accelerate his demise, steering into failure rather than correcting its course.For Bishop, anything would be better than to carry on like this. Little does he know that at the bottom of his descent awaits something far worse than overdue bills or even homelessness. Beyond his most terrible imaginings, his failures make him floating prey for the Black Ice, a remorseless being that skims the surface of mankind, shearing it for the betterment of the herd. His murder is coming and he will only survive if he learns how to die. HOW TO DIE #1 Variant Coverby Ralph Barrientos What you're backingThis is the beginning of a wild and twisted series.

<p>After a haphazard sequence of locations and interactions with many shady folks, Myre‘s life got thrown around. Myre is left stranded with no escape, no weapons and no allies, facing the herd of the most infamous and notoriously dangerous people on Yria: The Dwellers.</p>
<p>With no escape route, all that she has left is her own skill to overcome the next burden of her journey.</p>

<p>After exceeding its crowdfunding goal in 2014, Myre I came out in 2017, was nominated for awards and has even reprinted in German.  In it, the fiercely self-reliant Myre wanders the hauntingly beautiful desert realm of Yria with her trusty mount, making colourful enemies and shady friends who propel her toward a destiny she can't yet know. </p>
<p>Talks about the Dwellers followed her constantly, and it was only a matter of time until she ran into what she believed to be just rumours.  </p>

<p>Myre is a large series for which I have planned three big books of 180 pages each.</p>
<p>Each of the books contains 160 pages of story, fully illustrated and in full bleed. The panels are in the same style as you see in my fleshed out concept paintings. When it comes to Myre and the world of Yria, I make no compromises in regards of the vastness and complexity of the paintings. </p>
<p>The next Volume of Myre will reveal an even broader spectrum of the world of Yria and leads you further into the story, experienced through the eyes of the characters, their way of living and the dangers they have to endure. As the story evolves, new characters will be brought to life and contribute their part to the unique tapestry of Yrian Lore.</p>
<p>Now, it is finally time to continue with Myre‘s story and lead you further into the deserty and barren world from where her journey began. The storyboarding has begun, all brushes are ready to fire up.</p>

<p>What started as a vague dream many years ago has grown into a big story that takes place in the vast world of Yria. Myre‘s journey has grown since 2014, when it started off with my first successfully funded campaign here on Indiegogo. It was thanks to my founders‘ invaluable support that helped me create and complete the first Volume, which I published in 2017. From then, my work continued with my spin-off comic, ""Haunter of Dreams“, which was as well successfully funded and published last year in 2019.</p>

<p>Myre and HoD were both published in two languages so far and may be released on a wider market with translations in more languages in the future. Myre has been a big part of my life. From the very first baby sketch to fully fleshed out characters that roam the world of Yria and stumble further into its mysteries, there hasn‘t been a day when I didn‘t tinker with new ideas and possibilities to lead you further into the world of Yria. </p>
<p><i>Of course, this isn‘t only about me. Over the course of the past five years, a wonderful community of readers has formed around the world of Yria. The community spirit, from which great ideas can flourish, is one of the most important aspects for me. </i></p>

<p>""MYRE"" is a huge graphic novel project where each panel is getting the same treatment as one of my fully fledged digital paintings. I made this choice because the story and the characters are very dear to my heart. I also want to make the story as exciting and convincing as possible for you. My biggest goal is to breathe life into the characters in their environment. </p>

<p>Yria is a big world building project of mine that involves many creatures and characters. For the past several months, I have taken the time to explore new ideas, new characters as well as returning to already existing characters that made their appearance in the first volume of Myre. Along with the preparation for Myre 2, I painted pictures to explore the style and give you glimpses of happenings, which you can expect for Myre Volume 2.</p>

<p>Myre Volume 2 is currently in the storyboarding process. That means, while the story has been fleshed out so far, it‘s still in baby shoes in terms of the art. The storyboard is the very beginning of a comic, and a very crucial part of the process. It is the scaffold that brings all ideas together. This process is generally the one that requires the most action and focus. It will also hold the dialogue between the characters, which I will later base the final illustrations off of.</p>
<p>So far, I‘m 20 pages into the storyboard. This process will however go more smoothly and faster when I have the ability to focus entirely on that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588850921/nqtpqpzesg1tini3vows.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>With your help, you will allow me to utilise all my energy and focus to do nothing else but giving life to the characters the world of Yria in which they live.</p>
<p>Myre is an extensive comic project that is very dear to me. Every single piece of art gets my full attention and the same care, because I care for the story as much as for the support I‘m getting to help me make this project come to fruition. A single graphic novel of this extend takes its time, however, which is why I want to focus on it entirely and solely from beginning to end. One single person can realise a dream when they work hard and tirelessly for it. But sometimes, despite their hard work, the basics of life will keep their hands tied.</p>
<p>Those basics require a financial basics into which we must pour most of our time just to keep living, and our dreams are stored in a box for an uncertain time. This is why I believe that many people together can realise big dreams.</p>
<p>Myre has always been a big part of my life.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to me that I can work on the next Volume without interruption by outer forces that would put me under financial risk. It is also very important for me to take the time and illustrate the story as best as my abilities allow me to. I personally can‘t wait to embark on the next part of of Myre‘s journey myself and would like to invite you to the ride.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thank you so much for helping make Myre Vol 2 become a reality! </strong><br/><br/> </p>
</div></div>","After a haphazard sequence of locations and interactions with many shady folks, Myre‘s life got thrown around. Myre is left stranded with no escape, no weapons and no allies, facing the herd of the most infamous and notoriously dangerous people on Yria: The Dwellers.
With no escape route, all that she has left is her own skill to overcome the next burden of her journey.
 

After exceeding its crowdfunding goal in 2014, Myre I came out in 2017, was nominated for awards and has even reprinted in German.  In it, the fiercely self-reliant Myre wanders the hauntingly beautiful desert realm of Yria with her trusty mount, making colourful enemies and shady friends who propel her toward a destiny she can't yet know. 
Talks about the Dwellers followed her constantly, and it was only a matter of time until she ran into what she believed to be just rumours.  

 
Myre is a large series for which I have planned three big books of 180 pages each.
Each of the books contains 160 pages of story, fully illustrated and in full bleed. The panels are in the same style as you see in my fleshed out concept paintings. When it comes to Myre and the world of Yria, I make no compromises in regards of the vastness and complexity of the paintings. 
The next Volume of Myre will reveal an even broader spectrum of the world of Yria and leads you further into the story, experienced through the eyes of the characters, their way of living and the dangers they have to endure. As the story evolves, new characters will be brought to life and contribute their part to the unique tapestry of Yrian Lore.
Now, it is finally time to continue with Myre‘s story and lead you further into the deserty and barren world from where her journey began. The storyboarding has begun, all brushes are ready to fire up.
-Get ready for Myre Volume 2-

 

What started as a vague dream many years ago has grown into a big story that takes place in the vast world of Yria. Myre‘s journey has grown since 2014, when it started off with my first successfully funded campaign here on Indiegogo. It was thanks to my founders‘ invaluable support that helped me create and complete the first Volume, which I published in 2017. From then, my work continued with my spin-off comic, ""Haunter of Dreams“, which was as well successfully funded and published last year in 2019.
Find more information about Myre Vol 1  and get your own copy here, if you don't have it yet:
Yriachronicles.com
Myre and HoD were both published in two languages so far and may be released on a wider market with translations in more languages in the future. Myre has been a big part of my life. From the very first baby sketch to fully fleshed out characters that roam the world of Yria and stumble further into its mysteries, there hasn‘t been a day when I didn‘t tinker with new ideas and possibilities to lead you further into the world of Yria. 
Of course, this isn‘t only about me. Over the course of the past five years, a wonderful community of readers has formed around the world of Yria. The community spirit, from which great ideas can flourish, is one of the most important aspects for me. 
 

 

""MYRE"" is a huge graphic novel project where each panel is getting the same treatment as one of my fully fledged digital paintings. I made this choice because the story and the characters are very dear to my heart. I also want to make the story as exciting and convincing as possible for you. My biggest goal is to breathe life into the characters in their environment. 
Myre 2 is still in the making, but for you who don't know what Vol 1 looks inside, here are some pages, taken directly from it.

 

Yria is a big world building project of mine that involves many creatures and characters. For the past several months, I have taken the time to explore new ideas, new characters as well as returning to already existing characters that made their appearance in the first volume of Myre. Along with the preparation for Myre 2, I painted pictures to explore the style and give you glimpses of happenings, which you can expect for Myre Volume 2.

 

 
Myre Volume 2 is currently in the storyboarding process. That means, while the story has been fleshed out so far, it‘s still in baby shoes in terms of the art. The storyboard is the very beginning of a comic, and a very crucial part of the process. It is the scaffold that brings all ideas together. This process is generally the one that requires the most action and focus. It will also hold the dialogue between the characters, which I will later base the final illustrations off of.
So far, I‘m 20 pages into the storyboard. This process will however go more smoothly and faster when I have the ability to focus entirely on that.
 

With your help, you will allow me to utilise all my energy and focus to do nothing else but giving life to the characters the world of Yria in which they live.
Myre is an extensive comic project that is very dear to me. Every single piece of art gets my full attention and the same care, because I care for the story as much as for the support I‘m getting to help me make this project come to fruition. A single graphic novel of this extend takes its time, however, which is why I want to focus on it entirely and solely from beginning to end. One single person can realise a dream when they work hard and tirelessly for it. But sometimes, despite their hard work, the basics of life will keep their hands tied.
Those basics require a financial basics into which we must pour most of our time just to keep living, and our dreams are stored in a box for an uncertain time. This is why I believe that many people together can realise big dreams.
Myre has always been a big part of my life.
It is therefore important to me that I can work on the next Volume without interruption by outer forces that would put me under financial risk. It is also very important for me to take the time and illustrate the story as best as my abilities allow me to. I personally can‘t wait to embark on the next part of of Myre‘s journey myself and would like to invite you to the ride.

Of course, you won't be left empty handed. This campaign will come with great and exclusive rewards:

Jon Del Arroz is a #1 Amazon Bestselling author, ""the leading Hispanic voice in science fiction,"" according to PJ Media.com, and winner of the 2018 CLFA Book Of The Year Award. He is best known for his steampunk novel, For Steam And Country and his forthcoming Alt-Hero novel with Vox Day.
Jethro Morales is a professional artist having worked for Image and Dynamite, most notably for Hack/SLASH, Green Hornet, and Dejah Thoris. 
Del Arroz and Morales have teamed up to produce a superhero comic with intense personal drama like the Batman/Catwoman relationship has promised but never delivered. FLYING SPARKS: a hero and villain in love. You can help make this book a reality, with this volume including the first three chapters of this planned ongoing series, 66-pages of storytelling by a professional science fiction writer. The best part is: the art is already complete, which means this book can get into your hands much more quickly than most crowdfunded comics! Digital books can be delivered as soon as this crowdfund ends! Great story! Great Art. No Wait! 
But it gets even better: this book features a stunning cover by the acclaimed creative team that brought you JAWBREAKERS: LOST SOULS, John Malin (Cable, Thunderbolts) and Brett R. Smith!
 


Sparks Will Fly
What if you met the person of your dreams, but they're not only your direct opposite, but also your enemy? 
Chloe Anderson is a physics student by day, a hard working, smart girl who's close with her mad scientist professor, working with him as a teacher's assistant. She has access to several of his inventions, and in order to help test them, she moonlights as the superhero, Meta-Girl.
Johnny Benvinutti comes from a well-established Italian crime family, and recently found he has the ability to shoot lightning from his hands. His descent into deeper crime only creates the need to cover more up as he runs his operation out of a coffee shop front business. 
When the two of them meet, sparks fly on multiple levels. But will they be able to maintain their relationship while keeping secret lives from each other? 
FLYING SPARKS will feature the first three chapters collected in one volume. 66-pages of action packed story of a quality only one of the top science fiction authors in the field today can bring you. 
This campaign will help Del Arroz pay for art, lettering, editing, a print run of 1,000 books for the graphic novel, and the beautiful cover by superstar artists Jon Malin and Brett R. Smith. 
All Print Editions Will Receive A PDF Of The Book Free! 
If you want a T-Shirt or Poster + PDF, indiegogo allows you to back campaigns twice!

I'll be here when you're done perusing my work.</p><p>1stMan is back better than ever!</p><p>I created 1stMan back when I was a kid in the 80s when I was still only dreaming of being a professional comic book artist. I grew up reading Marvel's Captain Marvel and DC's Shazam, those books are a huge part of what I love about comics, and I modeled my guy after them!</p><p>Harkening back to the silver-age of Marvel and DC Comics, this return of 1stMan is fast-paced, action-packed, character-driven fun!</p><p>1stMan is the story of Luke Henry a freshman in college that is chosen to carry on the last Essence of the 10. There are 10 powerful Essences scattered across the universe, each inhabiting a being on different planets. If the being dies, the Essence will search out another worthy vessel. If somehow, all 10 essences were collected into one single being, that being would become the most powerful force in the Universe, a virtually unstoppable force.</p><p>Once Luke gains that power, he can change into Apollo, the 1stMan!</p><p>What, you still need more? OK, fine...</p><p>Monarch, the larger-than-life, power-hungry villain of this story, has collected 9 of the essences of the 10 by destroying the worlds they inhabited. He now has his sights set on the last one. Monarch travels to the world inhabited by the 10th essence, only to see it escape his grasp and find a worthy being to protect it and contain its power: 1stMan!</p><p>But 1stMan isn't the only character in this tale. Penumbra is the last survivor of one of the worlds destroyed by Monarch. She's a femme fatale, not an ally of 1stMan so much as she is concerned with self-preservation. Her main goal is to stop Monarch from gaining the 10th Essence. Once he wields the power of the Ten, Monarch will be unstoppable.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The main cast of 1stMan!</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605109150/s0rzosepdqtxau8fwouh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Each character will get their own biography page!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605109213/gbxe8vtug6tjq99pgje9.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Some of the interior art!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606849437/drds3w0qaliglpc3pjyw.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606849458/wj6liadscmiwdn4sjfio.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606849478/eyc8qwqeudclxwjmapce.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606849513/vg2u60f3zyff21b98n6z.jpg"" src=""""/></b></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605109383/dezbvq3i0k86xsxh1ste.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605109414/jbugeb7zlkpmvrty1hqz.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605109429/nsbbdqipdkngxlmqyhub.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605109458/e09p2z9ob9r8e12wat7j.jpg"" src=""""/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619279053/r6ackn0npcpvu231s3hw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619279082/dxbybmpgpxmpnngpmisx.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619279110/jvrisgc6wmoxqlqsyzkh.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619279165/itkv43dsdtbdqnrerl8p.jpg"" src=""""/>The Parody ad is back!</strong></p><p>I grew up in a time where comic books were filled with your favorite heroes pitching products and I've created one for the book to take you back in time!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605109516/j7ggunmra0kv6rbsro2c.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>$35-Bart Sears' variant cover</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Are you a fan of Bart Sears' art?

Some of my clients include Marvel, DC, Image, Valiant, Cross Gen, and, Ominous Press. Check out some of my work at www.andysmithart.com. Go ahead, take a peek! I'll be here when you're done perusing my work.1stMan is back better than ever!I created 1stMan back when I was a kid in the 80s when I was still only dreaming of being a professional comic book artist. I grew up reading Marvel's Captain Marvel and DC's Shazam, those books are a huge part of what I love about comics, and I modeled my guy after them!Harkening back to the silver-age of Marvel and DC Comics, this return of 1stMan is fast-paced, action-packed, character-driven fun!1stMan is the story of Luke Henry a freshman in college that is chosen to carry on the last Essence of the 10. There are 10 powerful Essences scattered across the universe, each inhabiting a being on different planets. If the being dies, the Essence will search out another worthy vessel. If somehow, all 10 essences were collected into one single being, that being would become the most powerful force in the Universe, a virtually unstoppable force.Once Luke gains that power, he can change into Apollo, the 1stMan!What, you still need more? OK, fine...Monarch, the larger-than-life, power-hungry villain of this story, has collected 9 of the essences of the 10 by destroying the worlds they inhabited. He now has his sights set on the last one. Monarch travels to the world inhabited by the 10th essence, only to see it escape his grasp and find a worthy being to protect it and contain its power: 1stMan!But 1stMan isn't the only character in this tale. Penumbra is the last survivor of one of the worlds destroyed by Monarch. She's a femme fatale, not an ally of 1stMan so much as she is concerned with self-preservation. Her main goal is to stop Monarch from gaining the 10th Essence. Once he wields the power of the Ten, Monarch will be unstoppable.The main cast of 1stMan!Each character will get their own biography page!  Some of the interior art! The Parody ad is back!I grew up in a time where comic books were filled with your favorite heroes pitching products and I've created one for the book to take you back in time! $35-Bart Sears' variant coverAre you a fan of Bart Sears' art? I know I am so I asked my long-time pal if he'd contribute a variant cover to the project and he was thrilled to do so! 1stMan Program Book! $15!This is an extra 40-page book that contains pin-ups of 1stMan by some of today's top superstar talents like Adam Hughes, Alan Davis, Bart Sears, J. Scott Campbell, and more! A making-of 1stMan showing unused layouts, model sheets, sketches, and more! In our stay at home and no conventions world, I want to give you the chance to own a piece of my original art.Pledge $100 and get a copy of the comic book a head sketch on the inside back cover of the book!Pledge $200 and get a copy of the comic book and a single figure sketch on the inside back cover of the book! MY COLLABORATORS I created 1stMan when I was a kid and when I got the opportunity to do the book in 1997 through Image Comics I asked a good friend of mine Rob Snyder, who is also a cartoonist, to help me with some of the dialogue. He'll be returning to lend his writing talent again to the dialogue with me. The colorist is Periya Pillay, he colored my Jungle Lords/ Ultra comic-book and the lettering is done by Steve Dutro, a buddy of mine that I attended the Kubert School with. Steve has been lettering comics for almost 30 years, working for Marvel, DC, and more! He also did the logo design for 1stMan. Another buddy of mine, Keith Champagne, will again serve as an editor on the book.What are the funds for?Great question and I'll keep the answer simple. I've produced all of the new art to finish the story and will use the funds to pay myself, the colorist, the letterer, additional production costs, and printing.",30.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p><strong>CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chrono Mechanics</strong> is a self-contained 60-page PG-13 comic.  </p>
<p>This retro-fitted action/adventure time travel story follows a team of highly diverse and ego-driven <strong>Time Repairmen</strong> as they race the clock to keep the earth's erratically merging time lines from imploding.  To compound their problems is a self-centered work-a-phobic new recruit who may be the one thing they can't fix before the whole earth falls apart!</p>
<p>We hope you will join the side splitting adventures of Team 9.2 of Sector 7, the best team of 'knuckle-busting, working class Joes' to ever punch a time card.  So climb on board a <strong>Chrono, Inc. Time Ship</strong> with <strong>Oot</strong> (entrepreneurial caveman), <strong>Caravaggio</strong> (Renaissance artist/inventor), <strong>Zyn</strong> (alien child deity) and <strong>Doug</strong> (70s rock legend) as they and our full <strong>cast of insanely funny characters</strong> save Time.  Hey, to these guys, it's just all in a day's work!</p>

</div></div>","CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW
Chrono Mechanics is a self-contained 60-page PG-13 comic.  
This retro-fitted action/adventure time travel story follows a team of highly diverse and ego-driven Time Repairmen as they race the clock to keep the earth's erratically merging time lines from imploding.  To compound their problems is a self-centered work-a-phobic new recruit who may be the one thing they can't fix before the whole earth falls apart!
We hope you will join the side splitting adventures of Team 9.2 of Sector 7, the best team of 'knuckle-busting, working class Joes' to ever punch a time card.  So climb on board a Chrono, Inc. Time Ship with Oot (entrepreneurial caveman), Caravaggio (Renaissance artist/inventor), Zyn (alien child deity) and Doug (70s rock legend) as they and our full cast of insanely funny characters save Time.  Hey, to these guys, it's just all in a day's work!
 

Working on this book are:  Pamela Thibert (Co-Writer), Jeff Eckleberry (Letterer) and Render Contender (Pencils Assist) and of course, little 'ole me, Art Thibert!

""When a simple teenage boy is bullied at school he unknowingly sets off a genetic trigger alerting the Agents Nexus, the people who created him. Now a danger to everyone around him, he’s about to discover how deep this rabbit hole goes into a world of secrets and shadows.""

*mock up of print version, not final version.*
Comic books were always a form of escapism for me growing up, being whisked away to new worlds of adventure, excitement, mystery and action!  Now after spending over a decade working in film and media, I’m working hard to bring back that same excitement that got me into reading with my first graphic novel series, BLACK PROJECT.

***Final cover art by Hugh Fleming***
BLACK PROJECT CHAPTER 1: MECHANISM OF CHANGE is a cinematic graphic novel series that takes you deep into the shadows of conspiracy! Opening the door to a new world where conspiracy theories are true: UFO's, Men in Black, Genetic Experiments and Secret Government Programs all exist as fact under a protected entity known as THE NEXUS.

THE STORY
YEARS AGO a clandestine group, known as THE NEXUS, was on the verge of harnessing the perfect weapon in the form of a small child - until an explosion rocked the facility destroying everything. It was believed that all was lost in the fire, but they were wrong…
Sixteen years later we meet Jack, a simple high school student who one day while being bullied, unknowingly sets off a genetic trigger alerting a strike team of mysterious men in black, Agents of NEXUS, who aim to capture him at any cost! What follows is the harrowing journey Jack must reluctantly take to save not only his own life, but to discover what ‘The Nexus’ is and who is behind this BLACK PROJECT. His only path is to go deeper down the rabbit hole, even if it kills him!

<h3>Thank you for checking out the Halloween Man: ""Valentine's Day that Time Forgot"" Indiegogo.</h3>

<p>Halloween Man is the weird adventures of an undead superhero and his sexy mad scientist girlfriend. Throughout its nineteen year history, Halloween Man Comics has strived to bring you the best artistic talent indie comics can offer.</p>
<p>This special two-part Halloween Man tale is a story of love, Elvis, and dinosaurs! Fusing elements from classic science-fiction like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, and Edgar Rice Burroughs' Caspak trilogy with modern cryptozoology, and other esoteric sciences, we've created an all-new pulp mythology, ripe for exploration!  </p>
<p>When Solomon and Lucy's date night is interrupted by a caveman fleeing ravenous vampires, indie comics' favorite couple are bestowed on a quest involving both Lucy's family tree and planet Earth's prehistory as they enter a legendary plateau filled with giant monsters! </p>
<p>If quirky comics are your cup of T-Rex, here is your chance to show your support for this offbeat Texas original.  Your donations will help finance our creative team’s production costs, as well as the printing and promotions.

<p><i>A word from writer/creator, Drew Edwards. . .</i></p>
<p>“While Halloween Man has been around a long time, it's always been a tough road for what is essentially a labor of love for myself and everyone else who’s been involved over the years. As a small press comic, it's easy to get lost in the sea of mainstream media.  Your funds will not only help us have the biggest impact possible, but will also help our creative team get a leg up in a tough industry. I've always thought of Halloween Man Comics as a place for talent to build their resume and take the risks that help them grow and mature as artists. This is your chance to help the talent local to Texas to hit the international stage in as big a way as possible.</p>

</div></div>","Thank you for checking out the Halloween Man: ""Valentine's Day that Time Forgot"" Indiegogo.
 
Halloween Man is the weird adventures of an undead superhero and his sexy mad scientist girlfriend. Throughout its nineteen year history, Halloween Man Comics has strived to bring you the best artistic talent indie comics can offer.
This special two-part Halloween Man tale is a story of love, Elvis, and dinosaurs! Fusing elements from classic science-fiction like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, and Edgar Rice Burroughs' Caspak trilogy with modern cryptozoology, and other esoteric sciences, we've created an all-new pulp mythology, ripe for exploration!  
When Solomon and Lucy's date night is interrupted by a caveman fleeing ravenous vampires, indie comics' favorite couple are bestowed on a quest involving both Lucy's family tree and planet Earth's prehistory as they enter a legendary plateau filled with giant monsters! 
If quirky comics are your cup of T-Rex, here is your chance to show your support for this offbeat Texas original.  Your donations will help finance our creative team’s production costs, as well as the printing and promotions. Help us roar like a Mesozoic monster and prove that indie comics can take on the big two. 
 
Don't Let Indie Comics Go Extinct: 
 

 
A word from writer/creator, Drew Edwards. . .
“While Halloween Man has been around a long time, it's always been a tough road for what is essentially a labor of love for myself and everyone else who’s been involved over the years. As a small press comic, it's easy to get lost in the sea of mainstream media.  Your funds will not only help us have the biggest impact possible, but will also help our creative team get a leg up in a tough industry. I've always thought of Halloween Man Comics as a place for talent to build their resume and take the risks that help them grow and mature as artists. This is your chance to help the talent local to Texas to hit the international stage in as big a way as possible.
 
 
 
Unleashing the Beasts:
 

 
Our tale is an epic, two-part adventure of romance, rock 'n' roll, vampires, and of course, dinosaurs! Estimated Release Date for Part 1: Feb 12th for Comixology and PDF.
Estimated Release Date for Part 2: April 8th for Comixology and PDF. Collected edition will be released on completion of crowdfunding campaign.
 
 
 
 
Can we do it? You bet Jurassican: 
 

 
No comic is made without an awesome creative team, and here’s ours!
Drew Edwards, Writer/Creator
 Award-winning comic book writer, horror film historian, music journalist, rock promoter, and showman extraordinaire; these are all guises of the creative force known as Drew Edwards. Best known as the writer and creator of the long-running underground comic book series, Halloween Man, thousands tune in each week to hear him as a cast member of the horror movie podcast, Castle of Horror. Known as “Howlin’” Drew Edwards to many musicians, he’s helped bridge the horror and comic culture with Austin’s legendary music scene with Halloween Man Productions annual “Punk vs. Rockabilly” showcase during SXSW, now in its tenth year, and as a contributing writer for Rockabilly Online. Drew currently lives in Austin, Texas with his wife, musician/activist, Jamie Bahr and their fierce lionhead rabbit, Janis Hoplin. JTA, Cover Artist
JTA's diverse work has been featured in a variety of media, including the children's book, One Day Luisito, the teen movie comedy, Ned Venture, the board game, Super PACS! The Game of Politics About the Game of Politics, and the music video/printed comic book, You Ain’t. Most recently, JTA succeeded in a Kickstarter campaign for his first fully colored art book, Aw, Hell! A Demon Art Book. JTA loves monsters, pinups and most foods (the variety of food options being one of the many reasons he loves Austin). JTA is a nerdy artist type, but likes to believe he also has some class. To that extent, he owns a pair of socks with a gentleman cat print and wears them. . . a lot.""  Jason Wilson, Artist/ Inker/Colorist 
Jason Wilson is an Austin, Texas based graphic designer, comic book artist, and special effects wizard!  
April Guadiana, Art Director, Colorist/Letterer/Design
Based in Dallas, Texas, April is a cover artist for Now Books and the art director for Halloween Man Comics.

<p>Hey that’s me! Who am I? Where’d I come from? Well, I’m just a normal dude working 9 to 5 living in a small town in Oklahoma. I always had the dream to create comics, but life got away from me. Life has a way of doing that. I had accepted that art just wasn’t in the cards for me, until one day I looked at my scared hands, and said, “I ain’t going out like this!” This isn’t about money, popularity, or fame. It’s about fulfilling a dream that I promised my younger self. I might be a rundown old man, but that doesn’t get me off the hook. Young Tonic wanted this more then anything in the world, and I’m going to make sure it happens! What Tonic Comix has achieved is already far beyond anything he could of imagined and I have supporters like you to thank for that.</p>

<h2>Illustrator Monk:</h2>
<p>All I know is that he lives on top of a mountain protected by an enchanted Dragon that goes by the name Todd. Also he is one of the most talented illustrators I’ve ever seen. He effortlessly combines high technical skill, and passion to bring to life truely amazing scenes. Though he specializes in pinup and cover art, his interiors are some of the best in comics. He previously worked on Tales from the Stack, is currently working with NANCO on Rags projects as well as being an original member of Tonic Comix.

TMNT Legend Jim Lawson joins us with a Saving the World short ”On Call Heroes” as well as providing a pinup of Lilly & Wepwawet. Jim’s influence on the comicbook industry as a whole cannot be overstated. His art graced the pages of Mirage Studios for over 20 years! If you read a TMNT comic, theres a good chance he drew it. He’ll also be returning with a full size sroty in Saving the World #3! But wait, there’s more! If we reach $3,500 combined between IGG and KS then each physical backer will recieve a signed art print by Jim Lawson! How awesome is that!?

Tonicmole:
Hey that’s me! Who am I? Where’d I come from? Well, I’m just a normal dude working 9 to 5 living in a small town in Oklahoma. I always had the dream to create comics, but life got away from me. Life has a way of doing that. I had accepted that art just wasn’t in the cards for me, until one day I looked at my scared hands, and said, “I ain’t going out like this!” This isn’t about money, popularity, or fame. It’s about fulfilling a dream that I promised my younger self. I might be a rundown old man, but that doesn’t get me off the hook. Young Tonic wanted this more then anything in the world, and I’m going to make sure it happens! What Tonic Comix has achieved is already far beyond anything he could of imagined and I have supporters like you to thank for that.

Illustrator Monk:
All I know is that he lives on top of a mountain protected by an enchanted Dragon that goes by the name Todd. Also he is one of the most talented illustrators I’ve ever seen. He effortlessly combines high technical skill, and passion to bring to life truely amazing scenes. Though he specializes in pinup and cover art, his interiors are some of the best in comics. He previously worked on Tales from the Stack, is currently working with NANCO on Rags projects as well as being an original member of Tonic Comix. I’m riding this dudes coat tails till he kicks me off.
 

Catch up Bundle:
Are you new to the Saving-verse? Well check out our Catch-up Bundle! You’ll get all four comics we’ve released up to date! (Due to low print runs I cannot gaurantee first prints of back issues.)
Our Mission:
The Saving-verse is a shared superhero universe with a twist. The twist? We ain't no giant greedy international conglomerate. Tonic Comix is dedicated to bringing intelligent alternative comic narratives into the superhero genre. We have no movie deals, and no Netflix specials. Our sole purpose is to make fun, engaging, comix for everyone! All we need to accomplish this goal is your support.
Tonic Comix began as a wild dream in February of this year and with the help of awesome folks like you we have rapidly expanded. We are ambitious, dedicated, and determined to grow into a major publisher in the upcoming years.
RISKS AND CHALLENGES:
This marks the 5th campaign by Tonic Comix, and we have built a reputation as one of the fastest and most reliable crowdfunding comic producers there is. As always the comic is already finished, so all we need right now is your support!",7.0,0,"8 Campaigns

Thank you everyone for being so generous with your pledges! The Amazing Cynicalman crowdfunding campaign ends 11pm Monday night (Sept 16)! I'm going to offer one more mind-blowing incentive... if the campaign hits $3,400, I'll post a private link to this video on YouTube for Indiegogo contributors only!! It's a time-lapse video shot by Jim Mackey of me inking my version of Matt Madden's one-page vignette from 99 Ways To Tell A Story: Exercises In Style, where he drew the same one-page vignette in 99 different styles.... I took up the challenge and drew this stick figure version. Now you can see it happen at super speed! Watch a half-hour job take only 3 minutes and 30 seconds! It'll be be posted on YouTube with some jazzy music for your eyes only if we hit $3,400 before Monday night!So spread the word! Do your Christmas shopping early! Tell your favorite retailer about the 5 for $40 perk! ===========================================Brian Eno once said, “The first Velvet
Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a
band.” The Amazing Cynicalman series has been sort of like that. The stick
figure adventures of America’s Laid Off Superhero have inspired countless
readers since 1980 to pick up a pen and attempt something they never thought
possible... create their own comics.As a weekly newspaper and web comic strip, the Amazing Cynicalman has been spread out over a wide audience. Each strip evaporates when a new one comes along to replace it. With all the strips
in one book, people will have a chance to be immersed in a permanent collection
that can live on for years in bookstores, libraries and ephemera shops,
inspiring more cartoonists for generations to come.
The Amazing Cynicalman, Vol. 2 will be my second book of
Cynicalman weeklies. The first one came out in 2003. People who were in middle
school when they first saw it now have kids of their own!

The new book will be 160 pages, cover price $15, offset
printed on 50-pound bright white paper, perfect bound, with a color cover,
ISBN, UPC... the works! A beautiful book that will be an impressive addition to
any library or bookstore... or to your own bookshelf.This will reprint every page of the Amazing Cynicalman comic

<h3>A new series from the creator of DEAD@17.</h3>
<p>My name is Josh Howard and I've worked as a comics professional for 15 years now. I am probably best known for my indie action/horror series DEAD@17 published by Image Comics. My other creator owned work includes BLACK HARVEST and THE LOST BOOKS OF EVE. I've also done illustration work for DC Comics, IDW, Topps, and Mattel. </p>
<p>T-BIRD &amp; THROTTLE is the book I've dreamed of making for 20 years. It's a story about comic book heroes and villains and what defines them - and how those definitions shift with changing times. </p>
<p>T-BIRD &amp; THROTTLE is a book that has always had the odds stacked against it. The publishers that specialize in superhero books don't want new original characters, and the publishers that specialize in new original characters don't want superheroes.</p>
<p><strong>That's where you come in.</strong></p>
<p>Last November I funded the 1st issue (and a 16 page #0 issue) through Kickstarter. Now, I'm asking for your help to fund the production of Book #2, which picks up right after the events of Book 1. And if you missed out the first time, don't worry - I'm offering a new printing of #1 and #0 with this campaign. </p>
<p>This story arc is planned to be 4 issues (not counting #0). Because of the nature of crowdfunding and the long wait between campaigns, I want to make sure you are getting your money's worth and a good chunk of story - so each of the 4 issues will be around 60 pages.</p>
<p>Want a small taste of T-BIRD &amp; THROTTLE before you commit?</p>

<p>Book 1 picks up 10 years after the events of #0 as Mitchell Maddox AKA T-Bird tries to rebuild his life and return to crime-fighting. Book 2 deals with the fallout of the events of Book 1 as Maddox comes face to face with the new heroes in town.</p>
<p><strong>I need your help to continue this story.</strong></p>
<p>The funds raised will go to printing and shipping costs as well as keeping the lights on while I work to complete Book 2.</p>
<p>I'm a one man production team. I write, pencil, ink, color, letter, and design everything myself - so it will take me a few months to complete this new issue (#1 and #0 are already finished). Right now, the plan is to deliver the completed product by February 2019 (but hopefully sooner!). </p>

</div><div><p>I have 15 years experience creating and releasing original work. I take pride in what I do and always try to produce the best product possible. When it comes to the unpredictable nature of art &amp; story, delays are possible, but I always deliver. </p></div></div>","A new series from the creator of DEAD@17.
My name is Josh Howard and I've worked as a comics professional for 15 years now. I am probably best known for my indie action/horror series DEAD@17 published by Image Comics. My other creator owned work includes BLACK HARVEST and THE LOST BOOKS OF EVE. I've also done illustration work for DC Comics, IDW, Topps, and Mattel. 
T-BIRD & THROTTLE is the book I've dreamed of making for 20 years. It's a story about comic book heroes and villains and what defines them - and how those definitions shift with changing times. 
T-BIRD & THROTTLE is a book that has always had the odds stacked against it. The publishers that specialize in superhero books don't want new original characters, and the publishers that specialize in new original characters don't want superheroes.
That's where you come in.
Last November I funded the 1st issue (and a 16 page #0 issue) through Kickstarter. Now, I'm asking for your help to fund the production of Book #2, which picks up right after the events of Book 1. And if you missed out the first time, don't worry - I'm offering a new printing of #1 and #0 with this campaign. 
This story arc is planned to be 4 issues (not counting #0). Because of the nature of crowdfunding and the long wait between campaigns, I want to make sure you are getting your money's worth and a good chunk of story - so each of the 4 issues will be around 60 pages.
Want a small taste of T-BIRD & THROTTLE before you commit?

CLICK HERE TO READ THE FIRST 30 PAGES OF ISSUE #1!
CHECK OUT THE 32 PAGE SKETCH BOOK HERE!
Book 1 picks up 10 years after the events of #0 as Mitchell Maddox AKA T-Bird tries to rebuild his life and return to crime-fighting. Book 2 deals with the fallout of the events of Book 1 as Maddox comes face to face with the new heroes in town.
I need your help to continue this story.
The funds raised will go to printing and shipping costs as well as keeping the lights on while I work to complete Book 2.
I'm a one man production team. I write, pencil, ink, color, letter, and design everything myself - so it will take me a few months to complete this new issue (#1 and #0 are already finished). Right now, the plan is to deliver the completed product by February 2019 (but hopefully sooner!).
