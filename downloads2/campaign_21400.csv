Founded in 2008 by professional dancers and choreographers Tina Casula Gross and Cheyenne Gross, Broadway Performing Arts Center has quickly become a neighborhood mainstay with steadily rising enrollment rosters. Children are introduced to a variety of dance styles including classical ballet, tap, jazz and hip-hop.  Recognizing that the Washington Heights/Inwood community was under served compared with other parts of the city in performing arts venues for children, Miss Tina & Mr. Cheyenne were motivated to bring their vast experience and talents to the kids of Upper Manhattan.  Boasting an annual dance recital replete with top of the line costumes, Broadway Performing Arts Center is gaining momentum as the premier dance experience for the children of our neighborhood. Classes are taught at The Cornerstone Center; 178 Bennett Avenue    (1 block west of Broadway at 189th street)  For more information, contact Tina Casula Gross at tina@broadwaypac.com or call 917.312.6263, www.broadwaypac.com We Need Your HelpWe have grown so fast and with that growth there is a demand for improvements.  We began in 2008 with just a room.

<p><b>What is ArtBra New Haven?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ArtBra New Haven is an art and fashion show event that provides a creative emotional outlet to the community of breast cancer patients, survivors and supporters.  It raises money to pay directly for treatment for under and uninsured breast cancer patients.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/660820/files/20140619120204-hc-art-bra-new-haven-20131006-022.jpg?1403204524"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p>With your help this year’s event will be held at New Haven, Connecticut's historic Long Wharf Theatre on November 6th 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What is an ArtBra?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>It’s pretty simple. Art + Bra = ArtBra.  Artists take simple, or not so simple, bras and through their creativity and imagination transform them into fantastic works of art.  They range from serious to silly, from sublime to spectacular. And each and every one of them tells a particular story.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/660876/files/20140619121209-I-shall-survive-1-640x480.jpeg?1403205129"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Adding a “T” to “PAIN”</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to stop for a moment now and tell you how I discovered Art Bras.</p><p>ArtBras are not a new thing, they’ve been around for over 20  years.  I heard about it from a friend of mine while I was going through treatment.  I was bald and looked like Uncle Fester.   Due to my lack of resistance I could barely leave the house.  So I started making Art Bras and I couldn’t believe how much better it made me feel to focus on something positive.  But it was still just something I was doing for myself and by myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That’s when I got a call from my Aunt Edith, a noted regional fine artist. She was calling with news that she’d had a reccurence of her cancer.  One day while calling to offer her support she said the most amazing thing.  I asked her if she was in pain and she told me “Whenever I’m in pain I just add the letter T and turn ‘pain’ into paint”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That’s when I realized I’ve got to get this idea out there.  To connect the artist community and the cancer community with the idea of creating and sharing our stories and experiences through ArtBras.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>JESSICA KONDRATH | THE MOVEMENT is a modern dance/contemporary ballet company based in Long Beach, CA.  We are currently raising funds to support our upcoming Fall 2014 season with performances in Long Beach, Pasadena, Santa Barbara, and potentially Chicago!  With your help we can make this season a reality.  Since relocating from New York City in 2009, JKTM has performed in San Francisco, Chicago, Santa Barbara, San Diego, Pasadena, and New York City, however this will be our first full length concert since moving from NYC and we can't do it without you!  Your tax deductible donations, large and small, will go towards costume construction, musician fees, lighting design, space rental, touring expenses such as airfare, and most importantly dancer pay.  In putting this concert together, we have had the great fortune to work with Tamara McCarty as a costume designer for <i>Fleeting</i> and with Brian Wood, who has composed a gorgeous piece of music for us to dance to in <i>I Still Haven't Learned How to Dream Wide Awake</i>.  Your contributions will make it possible for him to join us live onstage.  </p>
<p>In addition to self producing our home season at ARC Pasadena, we have been invited to perform <i>I Still Haven't Learned How to Dream Wide Awake </i>in Santa Barbara at HIVE, a group show of amazing local dance artists.</p>
<p>We are hoping, with enough donations raised, to bring <i>I Still Haven't Learned How to Dream Wide Awake</i> to Chicago this winter.  </p>
<p>This season is an exciting one that involves large growths for the company.  I want to thank you for helping me bring our work to the stage!</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>There are so many various costs that go into one production, but some examples of how your donations will assist us are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>a donation of $15 will pay for one hour of rehearsal (the small donations matter so much!)</li>
<li>a donation of $50 will pay to costume <i>I Still Haven't Learned How to Dream Wide Awake</i>
</li>
<li>a donation of $100 will pay a dancer's performance fee for one night</li>
<li>a donation of $200 will pay to costume <i>Fleeting</i>
</li>
<li> a donation of $500 will pay for our performance space</li>

</li>
</ul>It often feels as though the small donations will not make a difference, but if 200 people gave $10 each, it would cover our performance fees at ARC Pasadena.  Your tax deductible gifts add up and will be used to cover our season's expenses whether or not we reach our goal of $5000.    <ul></ul>

To anyone reading this first I have to thank you greatly for taking any interest in my cause. My name is Pamela Munoz as you might know and I am currently a senior in high school, I live in the South Bronx, with my dad and my sister is away at college. I am very passionate about acting and have been doing it for about 4 years now. Freshman year my first close counter with this field was when my mentor/teacher/and forever close friend Ms. Rothwell cast me in a school play and I began doing puppet work and learning what memorizing lines were, and even getting my hands on improv. The world of theater since then fascinated me. There was something deep inside me that came out whenever I acted, and I never knew where it came from. It is like a calling to me and its my time to answer. Since then I've done musicals and plays, from You're A Good Man Charlie Brown to Much Ado About Nothing by Shakespeare. I've gone to many summer programs including the Summer Arts Institute 2011, Carnegie Mellon Pre College program to even studying at the Stella Adler program. I have been very blessed and fortunate along the way, that many have supported me in my journey.</p><p>As a senior in high school I have applied and auditioned to many schools. I am very fortunate to say that I will be going to Boston University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts after my audition was considered for the school. This was HUGE to me. It was the first step to making my dreams come true. However this same dream now puts not only me in debt, but also my father. He works day and night as a cab driver to barely even make the monthly rent. It would pain me to put any more financial burden on him than I already have and so this is why this campaign is so important. Because 5,000 dollars could make a difference in making my dream come true. Something that I am so certain and so in love with is this craft. With any contribution made, it is a contribution, and it is a vouch of faith in my success in this career. It would absolutely mean the world for me, and give me the support I need to continue on in such a risky career. </p><p>In short, I will need 5,000 dollars to fill the gap in my financial aid that will go towards Boston University. Otherwise my dad will have to take this money out in loans, and he cannot afford that at all. This money will strictly go towards my cost of attendance for this university. Even if the goal is not reached, my family or friends or anyone will be able to fill the rest as much as I can, and I will do all in my power to fill up any gaps also. I will jump, scream and shout if this happens for me. And it is truly an opportunity that only comes once in a lifetime and I feel that I must reach out my hands and grasp it. Rather than make anyone else happy with a comfortable and practical job, I'm going to take the road less traveled by... And that will make all the difference in my life.<br/></p><h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Also...</span></h1><p>Anything you can donate, whether it be 5 or 10 dollars will make all the difference to me. And if you cannot donate, please please <b>please </b>feel free to share it among your friends and family and anyone who can help.</p><p>Thank you so so much, I am so incredibly grateful.</p></div>","First and foremost, the video above is a video of me and a peer acting.

Otherwise my dad will have to take this money out in loans, and he cannot afford that at all. This money will strictly go towards my cost of attendance for this university. Even if the goal is not reached, my family or friends or anyone will be able to fill the rest as much as I can, and I will do all in my power to fill up any gaps also. I will jump, scream and shout if this happens for me. And it is truly an opportunity that only comes once in a lifetime and I feel that I must reach out my hands and grasp it. Rather than make anyone else happy with a comfortable and practical job, I'm going to take the road less traveled by... And that will make all the difference in my life.Also...Anything you can donate, whether it be 5 or 10 dollars will make all the difference to me. And if you cannot donate, please please please feel free to share it among your friends and family and anyone who can help.Thank you so so much, I am so incredibly grateful.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Dead Prince</h3>
<p>Epic, goofy, comedic and romantic, <i>The Dead Prince</i> follows the story of a put-upon princess who is told by every magic mirror in the land that her true love has died and the two were destined never to meet; for he is dead and she alive. We join the play on the day she discovers it is possible to sneak across the void and steal him back; but does pulling someone from the brink do more damage than you think? A musical comedy full of corpses, bat attacks, magic mirrors, handsome thieves, horrible misunderstandings, lantern light, and quests...glorious quests!  <br/></p>
<p><i>The Dead Prince</i> reunites Strange Tree company members and associates with some new faces. Emily Schwartz is the author of past favorites <i>The Three Faces of Dr. Crippen </i>(2011 Jeff award, Best New Work), <i>The Mysterious Elephant, Mr. Spacky...The Man Who Was Followed Continuously by Wolves</i> and many more. Paul Holmquist makes his Strange Tree directorial debut. Company members Scott Cupper, Cory Aiello, Michael Downey, Jenifer Starewich, Kate Nawrocki, Stuart Ritter, and Elizabeth Bagby take the stage, along with associates Sarah Scanlon and Thomas Zeitner. Our friends Dan Behrendt, Amber Robinson, and Zachary Sigelko, all from last year's <i>Funeral Wedding</i>, are also in the cast. Ann Sonneville makes her Strange Tree debut as the princess Sara.</p>
<p>On the production side, we've teamed up again with some of our favorite collaborators, including Becca Jeffords, John E. Kelly, Phineas Jones, Tyler Core, Delia Baseman, Michael Huey, Joe Schermoly, and Becky Bishop. Kitty Campbell is creating as many props as a roving gang of musical bandits could possibly want. </p>
<p>All this magic needs a special place to unfold, and we've got it. The enchanted forest will grow in the heart of downtown, at the DCASE Storefront Theater, at 66 E Randolph.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've set a fundraising goal of $3,000 for this show. This will completely cover the expenses of creating an enchanted forest in the Loop: trees, ghosts, bats, bonfire, and gypsy caravan. Any excess funds will go toward our spring production.</p>
<p>When you donate, you get it all:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the love of the Trees! Making onstage worlds is the thing we most love to do, so we tend to have rather warm feelings about the people who help us do that.</li>
<li>All the show tickets, merch, and public thanks you can handle! (See the sidebar for details.) </li>
<li>All the tax-deductibility that comes from our 501(c)(3) status!</li>
<li>All the mysterious cachet and sexy intrigue of being a part of something entirely new! When you come to a preview of <i>The Dead Prince</i>, you'll be one of the first people in the world to get ""Simple Love Song"" stuck in your head. (Trust us, you'll want it there.)</li>
<li>All the extra joy that comes from helping kids watch theater! With magic, music, mystery, and tickets capped at $15, this will be one of our most family-friendly shows to date. Your donation helps us create an extra-awesome world for the audience members who just might be experiencing theater for the very first time.</li>
</ul>
<p>*<i>Please Note: To get your name in the program, your donation needs to be processed no later than November 5. We are no less grateful for later donations—we just can't acknowledge them in print. Thanks, champion! </i><br/></p>

<p><i>***And Also: If you want to get tickets to opening or closing night (that's November 22 or December 22), act fast! Those nights sell out quickly, and much as we'd love to, we cannot tip other patrons from their seats so that you may see the show. Well, maybe...no. No, we cannot.</i></p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">I'm Skippy Cooper! I've had depression for my entire life, but only recently sought help and treatment. Too bad I didn't have health insurance, so my only choice was to go to a government funded mental health care facility that hires people that made me feel worse with every appointment visit. All of the trash I had to endure just to not want to kill myself naturally made for great satire and comedy, so I've decided to write and perform my very own one woman comedy show complete with reenactments of the situations and characters I encountered! We all know how ripe with comedy depression is, right?! RIGHT!</span></h3>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are millions upon millions of people suffering from all types of mental health disorders. Fun fact, there are also a shit ton of people with mental health disorders that don't have insurance. That means that they will either not seek treatment, or be forced to go through a bureaucratic mental health system that can be slow, demeaning, and unhelpful in treatment policies. I want my one woman show to let people know that they deserve the best treatment that is out there. You shouldn't want to kill yourself while waiting for your prescription, because the entire pharmacy is having lunch at the same time. Your doctor should want to answer your questions; not push them off with comments such as ""You shouldn't even be thinking about that right now!"" The show will be comedic, but will also (hopefully) let everyone know that just because you have a mental health issue, doesn't mean you deserve anything less than caring, compassionate, and helpful treatment.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where's The Money Going?</h3>
<div>Sure, we have some money in our pockets; unfortunately, it's not enough to cover everything!</div>
<div>Every penny that donors give will go toward production priorities. These include:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>- Costume design -</div>
<div>wigs, costumes, make-up, etc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>- Set design -</div>
<div>lumber, paint, furnishings, etc</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>- Venue rental - </div>
<div>We're planning on having three performance days at two different locations...It costs money, y'all!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>- Technical equipment purchases -</div>
<div>mics, projector, screen, memory cards, etc</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Love the idea, but can't donate? We understand! Just do everyone a solid and tweet it; facebook it; blog it; text it; yell it; shout it from mountain tops; please do everything you can to spread the word so we can hope for funding! Thank you for everything you give and do!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Everyone! My name is Skye LaFontaine and I am a young actor/director here in LA. My sister Liisi and have put up two productions together in the past and decided that our next venture would be a little more ambitious, and because we both love the music of Rent so much, we chose to put our own spin on this well know musical.  I have been studying acting in college for the past three and a half years, but have been in shows as well and creating my own since I was really young. This is my passion, what I want to do with my life, and I want to encourage other young artists to follow their passions and know that they can achieve any goal they set for themselves.  With this campaign, my sister and I have started a new production group called Notascar productions, after a quote of our father's; ""Make a mark, not a scar."" We want to be able to put on our own productions, the way we want to, and leave a beautiful mark on the artistic community.  With the cuts to the arts programs in schools around the country, we believe that young artists need to be encourage to go out and make their own mark.  My sister and I both attended an arts high school, and even that suffered cuts to some of its programs.  My belief is that children cannot thrive without the arts, and that is why this campaign is so important to me.  I want other artists to see the example we are trying to set here and go out and start their own campaigns and bring the arts back to life.  By contributing, you not only are showing your love and support for the arts, but also to the young artists in our company.  You are showing them that they can accomplish anything they put their minds to, and that what we are making here is truly something unique and special! Our sincerest thanks go out to everyone who donates and supports!!  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In the past, i have self-produced my shows.  I hired actors, had rehearsal in my basement, scraped money together for a very small theater, as well as doing everything behind the scenes.  My family and friends helped out, but this time we need backers like you all to allow us to expand and grow.  The money we raise is going towards: renting out a theater for a week of tech plus four performance dates, paying a stage manager and a lighting director, acquiring the tools necessary to build sets, rent stage microphones, and pay our musicians and actors.  Our perks are detailed below, but you could get anything from a signed custom made shirt and bracelet to a performance by the cast members at any event you choose! We hope to reach our goal, but if we dont, the funds will still go into production costs, we will scale back a little to accomadate for the money we do raise. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Young artists often feel like they have no say and very few options in the creative process. This project is putting power back in our hands and allowing us to create the opportunities we so despratly yearn for. Notascar is a company dedicated to educating young artists about the impact their work can have on the world. Art makes the world beautiful; it puts music and color into our everyday lives. By donating, you are contributing to the growth of art in this community and around the world. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't make a contribution to our campaign, you can still help by getting the word out!  By telling one other person about our project, you are raising awareness and bringing our cause to light.  Remember that the arts are important, support the arts at your local elementary, middle and high schools. Share this campaign using the indigogo share tools, and come see the show yourself, and see what young artists can do. </p>

<em>The Subtle Body</em> invited to China</h2>
<p>Gold No Trade is proud to announce that <em>The Subtle Body </em>has been selected for the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center's ACT International Theater Festival in November 2013. This is one of the most prominent theater festivals in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The project represents a new level of collaboration between Chinese and American artists: half our actors are from the United States and half are from China. While artistic exchange between the U.S. and China is growing, projects performed by mixed casts are rarely if ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>To make this project possible we need your help.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The good news:</strong> We were honored to receive a nationally awarded Global Connections Grant from the Theatre Communications Group (TCG) to support part of this project, but, alas, it will not cover all our expenses.</p>
<p><strong>The better news:</strong> We have received a matching grant of $3,500 from Sunrise Medical Group. While they do not practice Chinese medicine, their grant means <strong>every dollar you donate will be worth twice as much!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have until September 2, Labor Day, to make our labor of love and imagination a reality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We also have some very nice thank you gifts for your donations!</strong></p>

<h3>The Play</h3>
<p><em>...A dyspeptic British doctor on an all-noodle diet, </em><br/><em>...a Chinese doctor practicing pulse diagnosis, </em><br/><em>...a British wife discovering multiple marriages, and </em><br/><em>...a Chinese translator at the heart of it all.</em></p>
<p>In this bi-lingual comedy, John Floyer and his wife Charlotte travel to China to research the practice of pulse diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine. While endeavoring to discover the scientific basis for this technique, Charlotte falls in love with the couple’s already married translator, Wang Ming. It's an 18th century love rectangle, where everyone must confront a foreign interpretation of the human heart.</p>
<p>The play is in English and Mandarin, with surtitles.</p>
<p>Written by Megan Campisi <br/>Produced by Kevin Lapin / Gold No Trade <br/>Directed by Michael Leibenluft <br/>Performed by Patrick Barrett, Ya Han Chang, Megan Hill &amp; Yuekun Wu<br/>Set and Light design by Danica Pantic <br/>Sound design by Mark Van Hare <br/>Costumes by Carrie Wladis <br/>Translations by Grant Zhong<br/>Dramaturgy by Grant Zhong and Peregrine Heard</p>

<h2>Extreme Vision Dance: Zimbabwe</h2>
<p>Six young men from the inner city of Harare, Zimbabwe need your help to make their dream of dancing in America come true. Their talent and hard work have gotten them this far; now all they need are the funds to get them to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Extreme Vision Dance Group has qualified to represent the entire nation of Zimbabwe at this year's Hip Hop International 2013 Competition in Las Vegas, Nevada. This is an opportunity far beyond anything they could have ever hoped for while growing up in the ghetto of Chitungwiza. With no formal education, they see dance as their only way out of this reality. </p>
<p>Their mentor, choreographer and friend wrote to me explaining that, ""<span>Not only do they have no formal education, but they have faced being thrown out onto the street, being orphaned, or living with a single parent who struggles to keep food on the table. They all face the challenge of being unsupported by their families and being continually told that they will never achieve anything or become something and that their lives are worth nothing. Before finding dance, they each had little to no self esteem and yet they are so talented. Going to the US will be an absolute life changing experience; truly their only way out"". </span></p>
<p>With your support they will be able to attend the Hip Hop International 2013 Competition in August. Here they will have the opportunity not only to compete while representing Zimbabwe, but they will also have the chance to meet industry professionals and like-minded dancers who are just as passionate about their craft. This could mean endless open doors to a future in dance and choreography. This is a future that would never be available to them in their current situation.</p>
<p>With very few avenues available to fund raise in Zimbabwe, we are turning to you, the fantastic global community on the world wide web, to help get them where the deserve to be: competing in Las Vegas.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What They Need </h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $30,000 to fund the travel and accomadation needs of the entire group and their managers. This will include flights, hotel and meals for 8 people. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, all the funds that are raised will still go towards EXV's trip to the Hip Hop International 2013 Competition in August. Every little bit helps and gets them that much closer to a dream come true!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With new connections and networks established from their involvement in the Hip Hop International 2013 Competition, these young men will be eqipped with the skills and motivation to return to Zimbabwe and will continue to change their community through dance. They will be able to inspire the next generation of kids to hope for things beyond the day to day struggle of living on the streets. </p>
<p>They are truly dancing to save lives. </p>

<p>My name is Keenan Jolliff and I am creating a theater piece called Proprioception. My pursuit in this piece is to find the place where movement and acting can live together on stage. I am interested in what happens when worlds collide. I think that there is an innate beauty in the risk of bringing two separate things together – finding harmony, exploring discourse, and discovering the places where things spontaneously line up.</p>
<p>In order to really explore this collision of worlds, the process of creating the piece will involve many collaborative endeavors, most prominently in the musical score for the piece. Two of my best friends have written separate tracks in separate genres, and my music producer and I are enforcing the collision process, and seeing where things land.</p>
<p>These tracks will be the spine of the show. They will inform where the movement goes, how the show feels, and where we decide to take the piece as a whole. Thus, it’s very important for me to be able to share them with anyone who cannot make it to the show. So we are planning on making physical copies of the CD’s with original artwork (which is also a collaboration between friends).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Your Donations:</h3>
<p>Your donations will go straight into the creative process of the show. We will need to split the funding between building the set, printing physical copies of the soundtrack, and advertising the show --- all of which will be covered fully with $500.</p>
<p>All funds that are raised past the initial $500 will be put towards future renditions of the show!!! So... that's always welcome as well ;).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways To Help:</h3>
<p>If you can’t spare any donations, there are plenty of other ways you can help! We are trying to get the word out about this show as much as possible, so just tell some friends, share this link on Facebook, or just come on out to see the final product! That’s the most important part of all of this! </p></div>","Summary:

Jayce’s first film starring Kristen Stewart, has been on the festival
circuit. That's a long time! The changing climate in film financing
has made it nearly impossible to get this production off the ground in the
traditional manner, but our desire to make this film has grown increasingly
into a kind of obsession, a common progression in the creative world. We
have to make this film or else. It keeps us up at night.<br/><br/>
The film is about legendary dancer Lauren Drake, played by Martha Graham
principal <b>Katherine Crockett</b>, who has just become a mother and is
struggling to balance her drive for perfection and her journey to dance
again. It also stars Tony and Spirit Award nominee, <b>Daphne
Rubin-Vega</b> (<i>Rent</i>, <i>Jack Goes Boating</i>). We can
all relate to transitioning from one label in our lives to another, and Lauren
Drake is struggling with the disappearance of her label of “star dancer” as she
morphs into her new label of “mother.”</span><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;""></span></p>

she has her baby, but for whatever reason, she feels incomplete just being a
mother. She comes to the conclusion that she has to dance again and risks
her family, her marriage, and her friendship to find what makes her truly
happy. This is a story that is often unexplored because motherhood is
viewed as something that should satisfy in and of itself, and to want more -- to
have it all -- is seen as impossible, even selfish at times. But what is
an artist to do when she can only express herself through her talent? </span><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;""></span></p>

be in collaboration with the legendary dancer, <b>Desmond Richardson</b> of <b>Complexions</b>. We
assembled our footage into a promo piece and are presenting it on Sept. 19 at a

OUR STORY
Tiny Dancer has been in
development since The Cake Eaters,
Jayce’s first film starring Kristen Stewart, has been on the festival
circuit. That's a long time! The changing climate in film financing
has made it nearly impossible to get this production off the ground in the
traditional manner, but our desire to make this film has grown increasingly
into a kind of obsession, a common progression in the creative world. We
have to make this film or else. It keeps us up at night.
The film is about legendary dancer Lauren Drake, played by Martha Graham
principal Katherine Crockett, who has just become a mother and is
struggling to balance her drive for perfection and her journey to dance
again. It also stars Tony and Spirit Award nominee, Daphne
Rubin-Vega (Rent, Jack Goes Boating). We can
all relate to transitioning from one label in our lives to another, and Lauren
Drake is struggling with the disappearance of her label of “star dancer” as she
morphs into her new label of “mother.”
Lauren Drake has left the art she loves when
she has her baby, but for whatever reason, she feels incomplete just being a
mother. She comes to the conclusion that she has to dance again and risks
her family, her marriage, and her friendship to find what makes her truly
happy. This is a story that is often unexplored because motherhood is
viewed as something that should satisfy in and of itself, and to want more -- to
have it all -- is seen as impossible, even selfish at times. But what is
an artist to do when she can only express herself through her talent? 
We created an organization called The Independent Collective with the idea
that you buy a membership and get cool stuff related to the film to raise our
budget. Sound familiar? We are fiscally sponsored by The New York
Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) which makes contributions to our film 100% tax-deductible,
even here at IndieGoGo, where we turned to jump-start our completion
efforts! 
Our project has grown incredibly in the last year and only because of people
like you. We were featured on The Huffington Post; we secured
stars Daphne Rubin-Vega and Katherine Crockett and
Director of Photography Kate Phelan; we shot three days in Ft. Greene,
Brooklyn, and at The Mark Morris Dance Center on two Sony
F3s. In very recent news we are thrilled to announce that the project will
be in collaboration with the legendary dancer, Desmond Richardson of Complexions. We
assembled our footage into a promo piece and are presenting it on Sept. 19 at a
fundraiser sponsored by Dance Magazine and created a trailer
for you to see the direction we are going in with this film (click above!)
But I’ve already given you money?!
Thank you! Seriously! We thank you
every day in our creative world of editing, rewriting, and pitching! With
your funds, we had an incredible three-day shoot, and you can see the teaser we
created from that here. We were able to test our
cameras and have since used this footage for more fundraising and to secure
more attachments and support for the film. You can still help us by
considering giving again, and it’s still TAX-DEDUCTIBLE. Or, you can spread
this campaign with a passionate call to action!

Simply
 engaging on this site by clicking links in the campaign, watching and 
sharing the campaign or video increases our ""GoGo Factor"" on the site 
and our chances of being featured. So by all means, go ahead!  Your 
clicking is very valuable to us!            
                
                    
If our campaign does not work, our
climb becomes that much longer. We have an INCREDIBLE cast and crew
waiting for the green light. Everything is in place EXCEPT for the
funds. We want to deliver this film to you. We want to hit the
festivals with it, get it distributed by any means necessary, and tell the
story of Lauren Drake, a woman who leaves her passionate and established career
as a principal dancer to become a mother... and ultimately finds herself
unfulfilled. This is a theme that seems so simple, yet is actually unexplored,
unaddressed, and generally “un” in the film world. We want this discussion
to begin.
How is our campaign different from the millions
of others in your inbox?
Because it’s our campaign, and we finish our
stuff, and it comes out! And you will be the first to see it,because
you've believed in us.  Also, we aren’t messing around.  We

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This summer, Villagers are invited to come visit the Fishbowl in a new comedic work by local Edmonton artist Fiona Williams. Finding Nymma introduces us to the strange and charming Nymma Gruen, a talented research librarian who has created a secret world: The Fishbowl, in a quiet, unused corner of the top floor of her library. Despite her practical research librarian demeanor, Nymma begins to believe the Fishbowl exists in a world all its own as she secretly hula hoops, eats decadent chocolate, and writes haikus all while keeping up a healthy dialogue with her betta fish Jacques. Nymma’s world remains a secret until the unthinkable happens: someone notices….. Now, Nymma must not only consider breaking the spell of the Fishbowl but also a romance with a handsome stranger.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<div>
<p>I'm asking for $500.00.  Finding Nymma goes up a BYOV at the fringe.  (A Bring-Your-Own-Venue).  This is great because we get lots of flexibility but it means the show costs a bit more to put up.  Here's an idea of some of the costs involved with BYOV Fringe shows:</p>
<p>Venue: $1250.00</p>
<p>Technician: $600.00</p>
<p>Fringe Admin Costs: $550.00</p>
<p>Media/Publicity: $250.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>For many artists in Edmonton and across Canada, Fringe is a huge source of income.  Both Michelle (my director) and Daniela (my designer) work as independent artists and their goal is to make that their only source of income.  As Fringe artists, we do get 100% of the ticket costs associated with the show but sometimes this only covers the cost of show and doesn't allow artists to walk away with some compensation for their work at the end.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>

<p>In <u>PARKER &amp; DIZZY’S FABULOUS JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE RAINBOW</u>, Vicky Luster, famed songstress of the Valley of the Balls nightclub has been shot by a mysterious man in her dressing room.

Her assistant, Parker, and choreographer, Dizzy, discover not only her dead body but her cryptic message.

<h1><b>Hello,
lovely people!</b></h1>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>I
am super-passionate about creating a sea change in how artists are prepared in this
country. I am a professionally trained opera singer who was an actor in New York City for a time and I have taught people how to sing for over twenty years now. For performing artists, their body is their instrument, and yet at most performing arts' schools, students are not taught how to take care of their bodies and so aren't fully prepared for a career in the performing arts. I think it's time for this to change. <br/></b></p><p><b>At the University of Oklahoma, I've begun to teach my students whole body maintenance - nutrition, spinal health and alignment and emotional and mental health. But to change the entire focus, I need to become an Alexander Technique Teacher. Once I become an Alexander Teacher, I want to take the teaching nationally - I will publish a book, keep a video blog and travel the country to give young artists the tools they need to maintain their whole body as their instrument.<br/></b></p>

<b>My name is Gwen Walker and I teach

     year of a four-year study to become an Alexander Technique teacher.<br/></p><h2><b>What is the Alexander Technique? <br/></b></h2>Alexander Technique is an age-old
     way to reduce stress and tension in your body. It helps increase performance, reduce pain, and prevent injury. I have been a student of the technique for twenty-five years and am now studying to become a teacher. If you’re interested, I’ve attached a whole

five years. All that has changed. I have been a student of the Alexander Technique for twenty-five years and still
I run and exercise daily. I feel great. <b>That is why I decided that I need to

In 2013, Rock - N - Roll Debauchery (or #RnRDebauchery for short) began rocking audiences at The Cutting Room NYC.  Incorporating classic and contemporary rock music, with Broadway-caliber vocalists, host and dancers, as well as integrating lights sound and band, #RnRDebauchery has begun to lay its foundation in the interactive theater market and community.
This tantalizing theater rock experience has begun its initial workshop and performances at The Cutting Room, one of New York’s most exciting nightclub and music venues, to house capacity (200).  Having filled the venue both in April and August, 2013, and with the upcoming ‘Nightmare’ Edition on October 26, 2013, proof is already being generated as to the size, scope and future development capabilities of this production.  
Each performance of #RnRDebauchery does not necessarily tell a story in the same scope/concept as a standard  musical.  Instead, it takes the audience on a journey through music, movement, ultimately allowing the audience to create their own story in their mind and explore what is being presented individually and together.  With the openness for the audience to participate and be a part of the show, the interactive elements (still in a structuredformat) bring each performance outside the ""fourth wall"" and directly to each person that experiences what is being presented.
In an ever-growing community of interactive theater arts opportunities, (The Great Comet, The Orion Experience, Sleep No More, Here Lies Love, Fuerza Bruta, etc.) #RnRDebauchery is bringing a new and fresh approach to this type of dynamic experience, catering to a vast number of audience member types.
Rock
Audience members are treated to some of the biggest and most exciting songs from the past 50 years in music history.  Performed by the industries most elite singers and a band composed of rock performers, each song is culled to generate not only enjoyment from the production, but also with the goal that the audience remembers their own history with the music and embraces this fresh, new approach to these classic songs.
Roll
Roll with it. Be a part. Come in with an open mind, experience what is presented, leave with an open heart.
Debauchery
The show is sexy.  From sexy ballads to burlesque, the show allows a heightened experience of one of the strongest feelings, while still keeping a sense of never ""going too far"".
The Chameleon Effect 
How #RnRDebauchery is structured, it is easy to add/delete/change song, dance and comedian selections depending upon the season, upcoming holidays, special occasions and events (birthday’s/anniversaries, bachelor/bachelorette parties, corporate events), and any other opportunities that may occur.  This fluidity allows #RnRDebauchery to be dynamic in the most intimate and expansive ways. 
Quality Control
With a strong creative team that have each individually worked both in and outside the Broadway community (equalling over 30 years experience in total), the #RnRDebauchery brand is of the highest quality time and time again.  Using bandwagon and social media marketing as well as incentivised producer/investor relations, #RnRDebauchery brings cost-effective development and production into its formula and back-end, while maintaining the highest levels of product and placement available today. 


 Where do your Dollars Go? 
Funds raised from this campaign will go directly towards the production cost's of RNRD. Those cost's include paying our cast and crew; five dancers, three band members, two lead singers, a host, lighting, sound, wardrobe, camera crew, or 17 people in total! Additional expenses come from rehearsal space, promotional and marketing fees, wardrobe budget, and misc fees like parking for the camera crew and all of their equipment or last minute props needed for the show! All of this equals the most exciting and bright future for RNRD and it's audience!

Overview of Studio 7Arts
Studio 7Arts preliminary goal is to bring Broadway-Caliber classes to students K-12th grade, Foster Care and disadvantaged children primarily in the United States with the belief that no student or child should be prohibited from Arts Education due to budget cuts or economic background. Studio 7Arts will strive to enrich the growing minds of young students by nurturing their utmost artistic abilities through Dance and Musical Theater Classes.
In 2013, Studio 7Arts also began a journey into producing cutting edge / interactive theater arts experiences for the 21 and over community.  Its inception was a benefit concert and collaborative effort of some of New York's most talented performers that included an interactive Pre-Show with Performances by MIX'T DANCE, a concert benefiting the organization and Michelle Mais (from Rock of Ages) and an after performance concert by The Annie Minogue Band, (National Artist of the year by LA Music Awards).  Because of the high caliber performance that was produced and developed by Studio 7Arts as well as the extremely positive feedback from the audience and community, it became apparent that this type of benefit was going to be the first step into the actual interactive experience that would make its debut in August 2013: Rock - N - Roll Debauchery.

<blockquote style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><p>“We're animals.  We just

<p>The year is 1978. Set in the pleasant vacation town of Waukesha, Wisconsin, three siblings and their significant others reunite for a lavish backyard birthday party. The ugly divorce and subsequent absence of their parents, as well as the looming fear of their own diminishing lives, are the topics of conversation...and a perfectly good way to ruin a perfectly pleasant afternoon. </p>
<p>The performance will be accompanied with a live band covering the nostalgic tunes of Les Paul and Mary Ford and a ""Tableau Vivant Series"" inspired by John Schneider's script.</p>

The Play:
      ""a voyeuristic look into the life of a rural Wisconsin family living the faded                                               American dream."" -Daniel Dvorkin, Artistic Director
“We're animals.  We just
react.  We never have to understand ourselves.  The desire to put
words to it is just a desire for the illusion of control over your
life."" - John Schneider, Pleasant Dreams
The year is 1978. Set in the pleasant vacation town of Waukesha, Wisconsin, three siblings and their significant others reunite for a lavish backyard birthday party. The ugly divorce and subsequent absence of their parents, as well as the looming fear of their own diminishing lives, are the topics of conversation...and a perfectly good way to ruin a perfectly pleasant afternoon. 
The performance will be accompanied with a live band covering the nostalgic tunes of Les Paul and Mary Ford and a ""Tableau Vivant Series"" inspired by John Schneider's script.

                             
The evening will also consist of a Two Lights Theatre Co. Visual Art Series, a Tableau Vivant collection consisting of six images taken at different times of day as written in the scenes of Schneider's script. Luring and nostalgic, these colorful images are made to give the viewer a sense of the story without giving away too many of the details. They will function as part of the set and will be seen as a touring series around various coffee shops in the Chicago area. 
The series is made in collaboration with the photography of Christian Nam and Karin Kuroda and will be presented at the show as well as ACTIVATE, in coalition with Pop Up Art Loop's Fall Gallery Walk: September 12th 5-10PM, Couch Place Alley, North of State and Randolph. Free Admission for the Gallery Walk Event.

<h3>Join us for a night of masquerade fun!</h3>
<p>For a couple years, I have had the desire to throw a New Year's Eve masquerade where people could dress in costume and have fun with others while ringing in the New Year. This year, 2013, I decided it was time to stop thinking about throwing a masquerade and actually *do* it. But it requires money to do just that, and to make it as phenomenal as possible.</p>
<p>The goal is to make this an annual event that everyone can look forward to and that can expand for more to enjoy. </p>
<p>The first thing that was most important was getting a hotel secured for the event, and to find a DJ. Mission accomplished on both counts!</p>
<p>The masquerade will be hosted at the Lancaster Host Resort &amp; Conference Center in Lancaster, PA.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to help offset the costs, there will be a $20 cover charge, but I am also giving the option for people to donate more if they wish to help out with other costs, including decorations and the DJ:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are paying for more than one person as you donate, choose the higher ""perk"" and make a private comment saying that you are paying for the cover charge for more than one person- please include your name and their name(s) so that I can make a note in my spreadsheet.<ul></ul>
</li>
<li>All funding raised goes directly into the event by paying for:
</li>
<ul>
<li>Catering at the hotel</li>
<li>The DJ services of C.F. Star Entertainment</li>
<li>Decor</li>
<li>An additional tip for the bartender since it is a cash bar</li>
</ul>
<li>A $15 supporting donation has been added. This is for people that may want to attend this year but can not, but still want to help. They will receive the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>An engraved champagne flute</li>
<li>Special recognition at the masquerade </li>
</ul>
<li>$20 cover charge covers your cost to attend. This includes your buffet dinner, entertainment for the evening, and a champagne toast at midnight.</li>
<li>Any donations of $25-30, you will receive the following in addition to the buffet, entertainment for the evening, and a champagne toast at midnight:
<ul><li>Special recognition at the masquerade</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>I hope that this is just the first year of this event. When I intially decided to go for it while planning, it has always been with the intent of creating a fun and inspiring event that could lead to an annual event people look forward to that just keeps growing each year- both in attendance, costumes, and the level of creativity. </p>

<p>The
play <b>Battered But Not Broken</b> deals
with the chilling story of Justina and Sebastian Blessing and their
relationship as it relates to domestic violence and being able to escape in a
safe, methodical manner.​</p>
<p>Justina
will suffer the consequences of her parents actions. She will meet a man, Sebastian Blessing that by all appearances seems to the opposite of what she experienced as a child. What she thinks is a dream come true will turn out to
be a nightmare. She will triumph over obstacles that would destroy most women.
She will live and she will learn, hopefully the lessons that she learns will
teach all of us about our own self. This is a story of a test of wills, a story
of love and forgiveness, and to God they are one and the same and God's will
shall be done. It will take faith, trust, love, forgiveness, intelligence,
common sense, obedience and a plan to escape in one piece. Prayer changes
things. Justina will prevail, but not without a fight.​​​​​</p>

We've got 2 weeks left on this campaign, and we need your help now more than ever! <br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em;"">We had a great fundraising event at the beginning of October, where we shared with many of you a few scenes from </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em;"">Versailles</span><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em;"">. The event was a success and we were extremely pleased with the feedback we received for the reading. <br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em;"">However, we have made only a very small dent in the total we will need to produce this play in just a few short months. We make no effort to hide the fact the this place requires a hefty sum to produce: $20,000. So far we have raised just about 7% of that, between this campaign and contributions made at the fundraiser. So now we appeal to you here, please open your wallets and checkbooks and contribute generously. Consider it a holiday present to us! And unlike those sweaters and fruit cakes you send out, this gift will yield YOU something in return! An amazing play, opening this February at the Theater for the New City!</span>

We've got 2 weeks left on this campaign, and we need your help now more than ever! We had a great fundraising event at the beginning of October, where we shared with many of you a few scenes from Versailles. The event was a success and we were extremely pleased with the feedback we received for the reading. However, we have made only a very small dent in the total we will need to produce this play in just a few short months. We make no effort to hide the fact the this place requires a hefty sum to produce: $20,000. So far we have raised just about 7% of that, between this campaign and contributions made at the fundraiser. So now we appeal to you here, please open your wallets and checkbooks and contribute generously. Consider it a holiday present to us! And unlike those sweaters and fruit cakes you send out, this gift will yield YOU something in return! An amazing play, opening this February at the Theater for the New City!

Thank you in advance for your generosity! 

Here is a short clip from the reading at the Fundraiser:

<h3>Help!!! Our Wonderettes are Stuck in LA!</h3>
<p>As you saw in the video, three of the Four Actors Point Wonderettes were left behind (by accident, we think) during the most recent Springfield High School Glee Club competition.  The girls don't want to disappoint the prom committee since the Crooning Crabcakes already did that to them earlier this year!!  Did we mention the Marvelous Wonderettes are getting to sing at the prom? </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why help ""The Marvelous Wonderettes?""</h3>
<p>Actors Point Theatre Company has the privilege of being the first theatre to bring this fabulous musical to the Nashville area!!  Don't take our word for it.  Here is what the critics say about the show:</p>
<p>“You won’t find a more delightful girl group! These irrepressible, bubbly Wonderettes are singing their hearts out in this charming, fast-paced musical. Beautiful singing, well-honed timing, often poignant, and highly entertaining.” –The Associated Press</p>
<p>“One irresistible musical! An utter charm bomb!” –The New York Times</p>
<p>“Don’t buy a ticket—buy two! It’s a show you’ll want to see twice.” –Back Stage</p>
<p>“Iconic ‘50s pop hits shine in this bubbly musical.” –New York Magazine</p>
<p>“An expertly wrought showcase of ‘50s and ‘60s pop music—it’s tremendously fun.” –Variety</p>
<p>“A generous evening of entertainment. Move over, Forever Plaid!” –Back Stage West </p>
<p>“It doesn’t get better than this!” –Dr. Joi Browne, WOR Radio</p>
<p>“A good time! Audiences leave beaming and humming. An infectiously charming homage to the music of the 1950s and 1960s.” –theatermania.com </p>
<p>“A fun, fun, fun show! Very highly recommended. The tune-packed show is a stroll down memory lane with plenty of laughs and great singing.” –Edge NY</p>
<p>“The Marvelous Wonderettes is deliciously enjoyable.” –Los Angeles Times</p>
<p> Additionally, several of our Wonderettes have done the show recently in other professional theatrical venues across the nation.  Here's a sample of what the critics shared about the show and their work:</p>
<p>""The Disney princess front girl of the Wonderettes is Cindy Lou Huffington, played well by the silky smooth Catherine Birdsong, who flaunts her beautiful flowing hair, alabaster skin and perkiness to match.""</p>
<p>""BJ Reynolds is the strong-voiced, brash tomboy of the group, portrayed effectively by Marie Wise-Hawkins.""</p>

<p>We really need $8,000.00  to pave the way for the return of the three lost Wonderettes (Okay...Really to cover royalties and other tremendous fees including purchase of music, neato and groovy costumes, sound equipment upgrades for the show, sets,  etc.). </p>
<p>Did we mention we pay our actors?   We firmly believe it is only right to compensate the professional artists involved in productions at Actors Point.  They work so hard to deliver high caliber entertainment to you.  We are honored to have been able to cast seasoned stage, film, and television professionals in our productions.</p>

Productions is dedicated to bringing the voices of writers of color to the stage in the Austin, Tx area. We are one of a few companies who consistently feature these writers.  Zell Miller, III, is the artistic director of UpRise! Productions.  Last year, we produced a very successful and award-winning version of “For Colored Girls who considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf”. This year, we are proud to bring to Austin one of the greatest American plays ever written, “A Raisin in the Sun” by Lorraine Hansberry.  We are bringing one on the architects of “The Jazz Aesthetic,"" as well as an Obie and Bessie Award winner, Laurie Carlos, to direct our production.  Laurie has been Zell's personal mentor for over 15 years.  If you have enjoyed Zell's work in the Austin area, then Laurie is to thank.  Zell's first community production in Austin as a child was A Raisin in the Sun, playing the role of Travis.  Zell is excited to now perform in the role of Walter, which brings Zell's Austin theatre experience full circle. 

We are in need of your financial support to bring this amazing play to the stage.  Funds raised will go to such production costs as Director fees and travel, scenery construction, marketing, Actor fees, lighting and sound equipment rental, and costumes.
 
Please consider helping us by donating what you can to this campaign and spreading the word about our production. Thank you for your support.
 
We also hope to see you at the show, August 1-17, at The Vortex in Austin.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Who we are and our project:</strong></h3>
<p>We are a theatre company called Poise Performance, which was founded by Youth Theatre Director Josh Ward and film/theatre Producer Liane Escorza.</p>
<p>We use cross-media, multi-sensorial and multi-disciplinary work (classic and physical theatre, literature, dance, music, video/film, art installation) to showcase thoroughly re-imagined and re-invented adaptations of classical text.</p>
<p>Our debut theatre show is “Dorian Gray”, an adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s work. It will take place on 7 – 26 October 2013, at the CLF Art Café aka The Bussey Building, in Peckham Rye.</p>
<p>We are keen to get the community involved not only by engaging audiences during the show but also by having them create art and work together on scenic elements of the play, therefore becoming an essential part of it. We are working with:</p>
<p> Leaders of Tomorrow, Kids Company, Peckham Vision, Safe n Sound Youth Project, Peckham Shed and Prison Reform Trust. <br/></p>
<p>By supporting us you will be generously giving to these groups while making this initiative happen.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Our Campaign: </strong></p>
<p>We need £15000 to fund this project. We are launching a campaign to obtain funds from different sources such as the Arts Council and other public bodies, yet unfortunately we cannot cover all costs incurred in the production. That is why we need your generous donations. £15000 will help us pay for the costs of:</p>
<p>-        our venue in full – for the 3 week run with 7 shows per week</p>
<p>-        the film sections of the show – equipment and filmmaker<br/></p>
<p>-        marketing – press, photos, print, invites, flyers, posters, web, social media... <br/></p>
<p>-       the pre-recorded soundtrack, studio hire and sound equipment</p>
<p>-       insurance of all equipment, production and our art installation and works</p>
<p>-       costumes and props<br/></p>
<p>-       lighting equipment hire, insurance and venue engineer</p>
<p>-       Rehearsal studio hire and expenses<br/></p>
<p><strong>What we need: </strong></p>
<p>If you could spare a donation, big or small, you could help us reach our target.</p>
<p>We won’t be able to showcase our work this October without you. We won't be able to have the kids and young groups of Peckham participate in the show without you! Your generosity could be the springboard for producing future shows in London and around the UK with exciting artistic collaborations and further community engagement. </p>
<p>Please donate. Spread the word. Contact us if you want to collaborate in any way!</p>
<p><strong>What we can offer you: </strong></p>
<p>There are nine tiers in our campaign. And lots of things on offer in exchange for your wonderful help!! <em>CHECK OUT THE PERKS!<strong><br/></strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Giant Killer Slugs</strong></em> is a creature feature written for the stage, complete with a small town sheriff trying to leave his troubles behind, an unscrupulous mayor in cahoots with the crooked BusinessCorp, a pack of city slicker kids who know the truth no one wants to believe, and of course, killer slugs that keep getting bigger!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>PIPELINE THEATRE COMPANY is a downtown Manhattan-based non-profit theater company, comprised of 21 emerging actors, directors, writers and designers. Pipeline makes theater of the imagination and hopes to produce stories that stick somewhere in your heart, your brain, or your guts.  Productions include: Timberlake Wertenbaker's <em>The Love of the Nightingale</em>, Tim Chawaga's <em>Sleepless City</em> (World Premiere), <em>Psycho Beach Party</em>, Alex Mills' <em>Shakespeare the Dead</em> (World Premiere, 2010 Dream Up Fest at Theater for the New City), Bekah Brunstetter's <em>Fat Kids on Fire</em> (directed by Tony nominee Peter Frechette), <em>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</em> (Winner! 2011 NYIT Awards for Original Music, Cormac Bluestone - Composer, and Nominated for 2011 NYIT Award for Lighting Design), Colby Day's <em>Felix &amp; The Diligence</em> (World Premiere) and most recently, Timberlake Wertenbaker's <em>The Ash Girl.</em></p>
<p>Our Brave New Works, whisper &amp; SHOUT, and Hung Up series, produced in tandem with our mainstages, develop and support adventurous original material and deepen connections with our ever expanding network of artists.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>Pipeline makes theater of the imagination. We thrive on adventure and believe no story is worth telling without a little risk. With Giant Killer Slugs you can help us take one of our most imaginative and adventurous strides yet as we attempt the impossible and stage a movie.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>In-line with our mission of delivering imaginative adventures, we have a big and boisterous production envisioned. This is one of our most ambitious productions to date and in order to make it happen, we need $8,000 by August, $2,500 of that will come from this campaign. </p>

<p><strong>Why do some nations forbid women and homosexuals to go to war?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does war lift sexual taboos?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Does media proximate us to or further distance us from the enactment of violence?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Breaking and Entering</em></strong><em> </em>is an immersive performance work blending theatre and installation art being developed by Masters students and alumni of California Institute of the Arts. Our goal is to explore the relationship between war, sexuality and pornography, media, and that way we have of playing out conflict in our minds like Sunday’s cartoon strips.</p>
<p>Artist Arjuna Neuman will present an installation - in response to an original text conceived by Kestrel Burley - which will culminate in a weekend of performances devised from the same text. An ensemble of performers will incorporate Neuman’s environmental elements as “characters” in a series of vignettes, transforming the installation from a purgatorial space with the <em>threat of action</em> - into a theatrical space - a place of <em>action</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breaking and Entering </em></strong><em>will take place at Human Resources in downtown Los Angeles, 22-27 May, and also as part of the California Institute of the Arts New Works Festival, 11 May.</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<p><em>“I make theatre because I assume that our world needs willing mouths to risk having our teeth kicked in and our tongues cut off - willing to swallow every experience in order to paint a picture with our spit, and willing to go hungry trying. It is the ripe opportunity for collaboration, experimentation, and expansion in Los Angeles that has made me fall in love with this community. The city’s sidewalks bulge and crack with the eruptions of old tree roots and soil, and its veneer is showing dire need of an overhaul. I have never felt the movement of roots anywhere as strongly as right here, underneath a bedazzling veil of vanity - our human fear of mortality - and my skin feels tender to where I have to (literally) act so as not to burst myself. I want to crack this city wide open.”</em><em>                                                 </em></p>

<p><em>“As a visual artist the opportunity to cross disciplines doesn't arise as much as is believed. Working with a theatre troupe as well as a production team has not only opened me up to a discipline that has collaboration at its core, but it has also been inspiring for my own personal work. As an installation artist concerned with space and environment, it seems natural, but also challenging, to apply my craft within a different context and history. I am learning a new way to talk and think about theatre, as well as my own practice, that is radically different from my training as a visual artist. I think these moments of opening up and learning from a different point of view are essential, and exactly what makes interdisciplinarity important.”</em><em> </em></p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Howdy, y'all. My name is Evangeline and I am an actress, musician, writer and producer. I am creating a new project entitled <i>Chrysalis</i> which explores the intersection of grief and growing up using storytelling, song, movement, and chocolate cake. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The content of the show is personal to me, and it has taken me several years to develop. In 2004, my brother was killed in an accident. This coincided with the end of my freshman year in college. This show has been rolling around in my subconscious ever since then, and I am overjoyed to finally feel ready to take this tragedy and transform it into something beautiful that is, at times, funny. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I hope that this show will allow my audience an opportunity to reflect on their own unique experiences of loss in a way that transcends mere sadness.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The money I receive from this campaign will enable me to produce <i>Chrysalis</i> this August in the San Francisco Bay Area, and then to tour the show to two theater festivals; New Orleans Fringe Festival and Frigid New York. I believe that addressing loss is incredibly important in the context of a culture where our grieving rituals are sorely limited, and that is precisely what my show will do. The idea of ""grieving"" is often only acknowledged in the immediate loss of a person, by cards and flowers and a short ceremony. Any other public acknowledgement of loss makes people feel uncomfortable. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Chrysalis </i>is special because, through the abstract performance languages of movement, song, storytelling, and clowning, it creates the space for a public acknowledgement of the long-term impacts of loss in a way that is otherwise rare.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Through careful consideration of production and touring costs, my co-pilot Ben Prusiner and I have arrived at a fundraising goal of $3,000. This money will pay for:</p>
<p>1) The props and set</p>
<p>2) Festival entrance and administration costs</p>
<p>3) Rehearsal Space for the development of the show</p>
<p>4) Travel costs to for the various tour locations.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Any donation will be tax-deductible because I am fiscally sponsored through Fractured Atlas, a non-profit organization. There is a list of perks for various donation levels and ultimately your support for this show will help me realize my vision.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1) Donate! Even a small amount will help me to reach my goal.</p>
<p>2) Tell your friends! If anyone you know may be interested in supporting this project, please pass this page along to them. </p>
<p>3) I am also seeking technical theater support for the Bay Area run of the show. If you would like to aid in ticket taking, lighting design, or board-op for the Bay Area run, lemme know!</p>

</div>","Aftermath
 
It's not the
storm itself—wind and rain lashing shore,
uprooting
trees, toppling poles and dousing lights,
flooding
cellars and roads, capsizing boats—
but the
aftermath—the bright calm, the pair
of drowned
cats crumpled against the picket fence,
the parlor of
Izzy's shack open for inspection,
the walls
fallen flat on all sides, your own
roof filling
the front yard, covering your car,
and your own
twin daughters dazed by Nature's
petulance—that
makes you reconsider
your life and
weigh your possessions and the cost
of putting
down stakes too near the coast
as the globe
warms, and storms grow worse.

<br/><h3>YOU DID IT! WE DID IT!<br/>
</h3>
<h3>THANK YOU to ALL WHO HELPED US REACH OUR GOAL! <br/>
</h3>
<p>Our time together in Boulder was truly rich.  Over the course of our week long residency, we brainstormed like crazy, took mountains of notes, worked late into the early morning hours to get at the heart of what we are, what we're doing, and how we're going to continue.  <br/></p>
<p>In addition, we engaged with 25 middle and high school students from Watershed School's art and photography classes.  In these workshops, Gabriela talked about the photographer's relationship to movement as they work. Students 
used stage directions and elements of dance to create simple 
improvisational structure<span>s, comparing how visual artists and dancers think about space, movement and composition.</span>  It was super dynamic.  </p>
<p>In this video, made after our residency by Gabriela and Denisse, you'll see a glimpse of our time together.  Thank you, again, for helping us get started!<br/></p>

<p>Zap McConnell (North Carolina, USA), Gabriela Bosquenegro (Cholula, Puebla, Mexico), Denisse Cardenas Landeros (Mexico City, Mexico), Paola Suculima De La Concha Zindel (Cholula, Puebla, Mexico), Cinthia Pérez Navarro (Cholula, Puebla, Mexico), Julie Rothschild (Boulder, Colorado, USA)  and <br/>Amanda Martin (Athens, Georgia, USA).</p>
We are <b>Chicken Bank Collective</b>, 7 Women, Dancers, Choreographers, Visual Artists and a Filmmaker, coming together from different states and countries to make films, perform dances, and engage in community service and public art.  The Chicken Bank is literally and figuratively where we collect our resources, be it money, time or sewing skills.  Once it's in the bank, it belongs to the collective.  <br/><p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866336/files/20140918103745-photo_2.JPG?1411061865"" src="""" style=""width: 254px; height: 254px;""/></p>
<br/><p>At this moment, we are in the start up phase of creating this international dance and art collective.  We will soon have fiscal sponsorship and then non-profit status, meaning all donations will be tax deductible.  <br/></p>
In the meantime, we have our first gathering coming up in Boulder, Colorado.  <br/><br/>During our inaugural meeting, we are going to get down and dirty and into the nitty gritty of what it is going to take to make this collective a sustainable reality.  <br/><br/><ul>
<li>How do we do this?  Scheduling, funding, planning, generating audience and reaching out to our communities.   All things we have done independently, and now seek to do so collectively.  <br/>
</li>
<li>What do we then bring to each others' communities and how does our collective voice reach beyond the confines of our borders?  </li>
<li>Giving back to our communities, making art that we feel has an impact on how we treat each other, ourselves and our environments is essential to us.  </li>
</ul>
<p>While the world of arts funding isn't looking so plentiful, and hasn't in quite some time, we are more certain than ever that we must continue to make art, to perform, to teach, to get kids involved in the arts and to encourage creative expression.  We are gathering in order to support each others' visions, to hold each other up, to be honest, to make work that we believe in.  Your financial support will help us collaborate in person and work collectively to inspire others through <br/>dance, art and film.<br/></p>In Boulder, we have a great opportunity to participate in the public art project ""Around the Bend.""  Zap and Julie were just awarded a grant by the City of Boulder to create a public art installation that aims to give people a new look at how they move between point A and point B, and what they encounter in the midst.  We are inviting residents of Boulder County to join us as we explore this question. <br/>Here's more on the project: <a href=""http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26493829/boulder-awards-public-arts-grants-julie-rothschild-zap-mcconnell"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AROUND THE BEND</a>.  <br/> <br/><p>Our vision for our future: we want to meet and work together 2-3 times a year.  We will all take turns hosting and directing projects in our home towns in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and in Mexico, as well as in additional locations around the world where we can reach into our combined network of amazing artists to <br/>bring our ideas to fruition.  </p>

<br/><b>What We Need and How You Can Help</b>
<p>For those of you who have supported us as individual artists in the past, we invite you to help us take these early steps and stay afloat during this start up phase.  $3000 will get us rolling.  To be able to continue to work together in person is a significant financial challenge, but one we believe is worth the effort.<br/></p>
<p>Your support in any amount helps us take this leap of faith.</p>
<p>Whatever it is that you can do to help us get going, a small donation, a BIG donation, a shout out to your art loving friends or a simple word of support, we extend our appreciation.  And we hope that Chicken Bank Collective can come to <br/>your community in the very near future.<br/></p>

THANK YOU to ALL WHO HELPED US REACH OUR GOAL! 

Our time together in Boulder was truly rich.  Over the course of our week long residency, we brainstormed like crazy, took mountains of notes, worked late into the early morning hours to get at the heart of what we are, what we're doing, and how we're going to continue.  
In addition, we engaged with 25 middle and high school students from Watershed School's art and photography classes.  In these workshops, Gabriela talked about the photographer's relationship to movement as they work. Students 
used stage directions and elements of dance to create simple 
improvisational structures, comparing how visual artists and dancers think about space, movement and composition.  It was super dynamic.  
In this video, made after our residency by Gabriela and Denisse, you'll see a glimpse of our time together.  Thank you, again, for helping us get started!

NEXT STEPS:

establishing fiscal sponsorship and a cohesive fundraising plan

creating our blog
planning 2015 residencies

STAY TUNED!


Chicken Bank CollectiveTejiendo comunidades entre fronteras a través del arte del movimiento. 
Weaving communities across borders through the art of movement.


our campaign
Chicken Bank Collective, a group of artists who have worked together enough to know we want to work together for a good long time.
 Who We Are and What We're Up To: 
Zap McConnell (North Carolina, USA), Gabriela Bosquenegro (Cholula, Puebla, Mexico), Denisse Cardenas Landeros (Mexico City, Mexico), Paola Suculima De La Concha Zindel (Cholula, Puebla, Mexico), Cinthia Pérez Navarro (Cholula, Puebla, Mexico), Julie Rothschild (Boulder, Colorado, USA)  and Amanda Martin (Athens, Georgia, USA).
We are Chicken Bank Collective, 7 Women, Dancers, Choreographers, Visual Artists and a Filmmaker, coming together from different states and countries to make films, perform dances, and engage in community service and public art.  The Chicken Bank is literally and figuratively where we collect our resources, be it money, time or sewing skills.  Once it's in the bank, it belongs to the collective.  


At this moment, we are in the start up phase of creating this international dance and art collective.  We will soon have fiscal sponsorship and then non-profit status, meaning all donations will be tax deductible.  
In the meantime, we have our first gathering coming up in Boulder, Colorado.  During our inaugural meeting, we are going to get down and dirty and into the nitty gritty of what it is going to take to make this collective a sustainable reality.  
How do we do this?  Scheduling, funding, planning, generating audience and reaching out to our communities.   All things we have done independently, and now seek to do so collectively.  

What do we then bring to each others' communities and how does our collective voice reach beyond the confines of our borders?  
Giving back to our communities, making art that we feel has an impact on how we treat each other, ourselves and our environments is essential to us.  

While the world of arts funding isn't looking so plentiful, and hasn't in quite some time, we are more certain than ever that we must continue to make art, to perform, to teach, to get kids involved in the arts and to encourage creative expression.  We are gathering in order to support each others' visions, to hold each other up, to be honest, to make work that we believe in.  Your financial support will help us collaborate in person and work collectively to inspire others through dance, art and film.In Boulder, we have a great opportunity to participate in the public art project ""Around the Bend.""  Zap and Julie were just awarded a grant by the City of Boulder to create a public art installation that aims to give people a new look at how they move between point A and point B, and what they encounter in the midst.  We are inviting residents of Boulder County to join us as we explore this question. Here's more on the project: AROUND THE BEND.   Our vision for our future: we want to meet and work together 2-3 times a year.  We will all take turns hosting and directing projects in our home towns in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and in Mexico, as well as in additional locations around the world where we can reach into our combined network of amazing artists to bring our ideas to fruition.  

What We Need and How You Can Help
For those of you who have supported us as individual artists in the past, we invite you to help us take these early steps and stay afloat during this start up phase.  $3000 will get us rolling.  To be able to continue to work together in person is a significant financial challenge, but one we believe is worth the effort.
Your support in any amount helps us take this leap of faith.
Whatever it is that you can do to help us get going, a small donation, a BIG donation, a shout out to your art loving friends or a simple word of support, we extend our appreciation.  And we hope that Chicken Bank Collective can come to your community in the very near future.

We are so strong that we can take the emotions from that day, our emotions as a military child, our emotions as a military spouse and our emotions of being a part of the American Armed Forces and use it as our time to dance.

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are off to the Minnesota Fringe Festival to present <b><i>Duetted</i></b>, July 31-August 9, 2014!  </p>
<p>Monica and Dan are set to celebrate 10 years of dancing and choreographing together by looking back while charging ahead.  <b><i>Duetted</i></b> will showcase new works, some greatest hits from our repertory, and choreography by other artists that have been creatively and professionally influential.  For our fourth adventure to the MN Fringe, long time friend, mentor, and collaborator, Debra Loewen (Milwaukee, WI), stages a new work based on duets we have danced for Wild Space Dance Company during our 12 years with the company.  Suniti Dernovsek (Portland, OR) resets a work from her acclaimed evening length work, <i>This Is How We Disappear,</i> and in collaboration with their first friend at the 2006 Minnesota Fringe, Monica and Dan make a long-distance collaboration with Mike Mathieu (Seattle, WA) of the Cody Rivers Show.  Finally, the duo perform Susan Marshall’s (NYC) <i>Crimson &amp; Clover</i>, the gorgeous and audibly captivating duet from the 2006 evening-length concert <i>Cloudless.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>We need your help!</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As independent artists we need your financial backing to go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel Expense - to NYC and Minnesota</li>
<li>Commission and Licensing Fees for the choreography &amp; music</li>
<li>General Expenses such as rental of rehearsal space, marketing, and production fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Any amount you can contribute is greatly appreciated and those of $20 or more receive gifts in return. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>A little about us -</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The performing pair, Rodero and Schuchart, are both pretty laid back, have a great sense of humor, and only argue about choreography.  Their first independent concert was in the summer of 2004, which makes it easy to remember when they had their first fight.  After a few years in sunny California to earn MFA degrees in Experimental Choreography (i.e. how to fight for real) the pair has returned to the Midwest to celebrate ten years of making innovative, physical, and humorous work together.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Whether you are able to make a contribution today or not, please help spread the word and join us for the event!</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>During the spring I began creating a mammoth directory and interactive database that currently holds over 150 writers and 360 songs (all searchable by voice and song type).

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Knowing the project was too big to handle alone, I asked my friend Lorene Phillips - with whom I previously co-founded Caprice Opera Theatre - to join me. I was thrilled when she said yes!</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>We need your help! Lorene and I have solely funded the project thus far because we believe in it.

<h3>Miss Burlesque Bunny and Blue Belle Burlesque</h3>
<p>""Tease 'n' Tassels"" is the premier event for Blue Belle Burlesque and includes Heat 1 of the Miss Burlesque Bunny competition. In its inaugural year, this awards program aims to encourage and mentor the next generation of burlesque performers, and help launch their stage careers from ingenue to impresario.</p>
<p>Each heat of the competition is held during the quarterly Blue Belle Burlesque revue showcase event, Tease 'n' Tassels. The idea of this is to bring seasoned entertainers together with new performers, to provide an opportunity to network, learn - and perform for a large audience.</p>
<p>It will be judged by a panel of burlesque teachers and principal dancers from the local burlesque community. Entrants for the competition must have been performing burlesque for less than two years, and hold no other major titles.</p>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">Building a strong profile for the event now will help to attract interest for the next two heats and sponsors for the Miss Burlesque Bunny grand final event in 2013. I hope to award the winner gift vouchers, classes, costumes etc from local business and send them to the Burlesque Hall of Fame in Vegas. </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">
<br/>Blue Belle Burlesque is part burlesque, part vaudeville and 100% fabulous. Located in Edmonton, Alberta and directed by Australian performer Jade Janvier, it features a mischievous line up of ladies in a show that will capture fetish, fusion, classic burlesque and the circus arts.</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_show""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">With feature performances from well known local talent including Lylia Chorosive of Chorosive Dark Fusion, and Kiki Quinn of River City Revue Burlesque, as well as soloists Cherry Poppins, Samantha Rose, Casha Clay and Miss Rainbow, the audience will enjoy a diverse show from a troupe that has performed collectively coast to coast in Canada, and across the Pacific in Australia and New Zealand.<br/><br/>

""Tease 'n' Tassels"" is the premier event for Blue Belle Burlesque and includes Heat 1 of the Miss Burlesque Bunny competition. In its inaugural year, this awards program aims to encourage and mentor the next generation of burlesque performers, and help launch their stage careers from ingenue to impresario.
Each heat of the competition is held during the quarterly Blue Belle Burlesque revue showcase event, Tease 'n' Tassels. The idea of this is to bring seasoned entertainers together with new performers, to provide an opportunity to network, learn - and perform for a large audience.
It will be judged by a panel of burlesque teachers and principal dancers from the local burlesque community. Entrants for the competition must have been performing burlesque for less than two years, and hold no other major titles.
Building a strong profile for the event now will help to attract interest for the next two heats and sponsors for the Miss Burlesque Bunny grand final event in 2013. I hope to award the winner gift vouchers, classes, costumes etc from local business and send them to the Burlesque Hall of Fame in Vegas. 

Blue Belle Burlesque is part burlesque, part vaudeville and 100% fabulous. Located in Edmonton, Alberta and directed by Australian performer Jade Janvier, it features a mischievous line up of ladies in a show that will capture fetish, fusion, classic burlesque and the circus arts.
 
With feature performances from well known local talent including Lylia Chorosive of Chorosive Dark Fusion, and Kiki Quinn of River City Revue Burlesque, as well as soloists Cherry Poppins, Samantha Rose, Casha Clay and Miss Rainbow, the audience will enjoy a diverse show from a troupe that has performed collectively coast to coast in Canada, and across the Pacific in Australia and New Zealand.

</p><p><b>Mission Statement</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the goal of Fuzion Contemporary Dance Company to teach young people to achieve a life-long love of dance and creative freedom by stressing excellence in both education and performance.  The organization encourages self-confidence, self discipline, responsibility and unity among diversity.</p>
<p>By stressing attention to detail, skill and technique, and exploring a wide variety of dance styles, the students learn time management, discipline, and experience a level of performance excellence and performance opportunities not available through their public/private school dance programs.</p>
<p><b>Primary Activity</b></p>
<p>Fuzion Contemporary Dance Company began its educational activities in May 2005.  Weekly class sessions and dance rehearsals provide instruction by qualified dance educators.</p>
<p>These classes and rehearsals are designed to teach attention to detail through repetition of skill and technique, time management and provide the learning of many varied dance styles, to include ballet, jazz, lyrical, contemporary ballet, modern, hip hop, and tap.</p>
<p>Fuzion Contemporary Dance Company students participate in 4 - 12.5 hours of classroom instruction and rehearse 5 - 10 hours per week.  Seventy percent (70%) of Fuzion Contemporary Dance Company's purpose is met through this educational setting.  FCDC maintains a low teacher-to-student ratio allowing for the additional achievement of not only high artistic standards, but also the development of self-control, responsibility, citizenship, creative expression and the ability to work with others.  Fuzion Contemporary Dance Company also contracts with professional choreographers to provide students exposure to the creative process of dance.</p>
<p><b>Secondary Activity</b></p>
<p>Performances at Fuzion Contemporary Dance Company concerts and community events showcase the skills of company members and introduce the community to Fuzion's mission and goals.  FCDC performances encompass an additional thirty percent (30%) of the purpose, vision and mission.  The intent of these performances is to provide a forum for students to enhance and fine-tune their dance skills and technique, and to develop an appreciation for the performing arts.  Fuzion Contemporary Dance Company uses these event performances to reach the community, expanding the opportunity to raise community awareness of the dance arts.  </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>FCDC believes that giving back and paying forward are important aspects of living in a community.</b></p>
<p>Fuzion has supported local non-profit organizations by performing at benefits such as Dancers Against Cancer and Upstage Arts.  FCDC donates tickets to their bi-annual shows to Big Brothers Big Sisters and the Bay Area Turning Point.  Company members serve as positive role models by supporting the ""Drug Free Program"", performing at local elementary schools, and community events including, The Oak Tree Festival, Ballunar Festival, and Houston's Children's Fest.  They celebrated League City's ""50th Gala"" and the Barnevelder's ""Dance Gathering"" with outstanding performances.  FCDC supports the ""Community in School"" Program each year with canned food drives and they donate a portion of every ticket to their concerts to the Bay Area Turning Point.  Fuzion also provides scholarships to students who are at risk by offering dance classes and performance opportunities.  FCDC believes that helping children gain exposure and access to these activities will go a long way in affecting positive change in their lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need </h3><p></p>

</p><p>Fuzion Contemporary Dance Company is striving to bring a contemporary version of the holiday classic ""The Nutcracker"" to their community.  Fuzion's ""The Fuzed Nutcracker"" has a fresh spin on the story and uses the surrounding area of Clear Lake and Webster Texas and original cast members as inspiration.  FCDC is 2.1 miles from NASA's Johnson Space Center so they tied the space program into their story by sending the lead role to outer space in Act II.  The lead and supporting roles of Clara, Drosselmeyer, Fritz and more are renamed after the FCDC alumni that originated the roles.  In keeping with Fuzion's initial mission statement, ""The Fuzed Nutcracker"" uses a variety of styles of dance such as ballet, contemporary ballet, jazz, lyrical, modern, and hip hop to bring to life FCDC's version of a holiday classic with a new twist!</p>
<p>Fuzion has presented their Fuzed Nutcracker annually for 6 years.  The Artistic Director feels having an annual production is important to the growth of a dancer.

Each year Fuzion produces two shows, usually they are The Fuzed Nutcracker and Funk, Soul, Dance.  The past two years however, Fuzion has not produced the Fuzed Nutcracker due to lack of funding.  Fuzion's artistic director feels the time is right to present the 7th annual production of the Fuzed Nutcracker.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>If we don't get funded:  The show must go on but...</b></p><p>1)  Rehearsal space will be cut so we'll have less time to rehearse and produce a quality show.</p><p>2)  No sets.  Sets help provide atmosphere for the show and helps the audience experience the story.</p><p>3)  No backdrops.  Backdrops will make our show polished and professional.</p><p>4)  Rehearsal Director/Artistic Director will not get paid.</p><p>5)  Professional division dancers of FCDC will not get paid to perform.</p><p>6)  No guest artists.  We will have to cut some of the dances in the show because we won't be able to hire a <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">male lead (Apollo) or a 3rd partner for our cha-cha in the party scene. </span></p><p>7)  Rehearsal Assistant will not get paid.</p><p>8)  No flowers for the leads in the show.</p><p>9)  Dancers and crew will pay for their own lunch on show day.</p><p>10) No cast party.</p><p>11) No new costumes.  Dancers will perfom in old costumes that are worn out and don't fit properly.</p><p>12)  Cost for paper and ink and printing of tickets, posters, and programs will come out of the Artistic <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Directors pocket.</span></p><br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you can't donate... please, please, please help us spread the word!</p></div>","Mission Statement

<h3>Hi, I'm Hadley.</h3>
<p>I've been creating dance work in New York for the past decade. As an artist, one of my main desires is to create work that pays homage to the powerful women who populate my daily life. For the past two years I've been working with some of these women; who have overwhelmed me with their dedication and generosity. <strong>Tanogram</strong>, a new dance piece, is the result of many hours of working together - working through personal and political pain, working at witnessing one another, working for each other.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>These Women Need to Get Paid</h3>
<p>I've been amazed by my collaborators generosity. Kirsten Schnitker, for example, came into the studio with me to start this process almost two years ago. Two years guys! It may not seem like a long time for a big project to develop, but it is when you're dedicating hours every week and also working a full time job. Elanor Bock joined this process not long after, and this past spring Emily Bock joined us from Chicago, sometimes flying back and forth from a summer teaching job. DID I MENTION THESE WOMEN SHOULD REALLY GET PAID? All of us have received intangible benefits from the practices that became apart of this process, but at the end of the day we need to be paid in order to sustain this work.</p>
<p>Creating and sustaining creative practices and meaningful community in this world is hard. By giving to this campaign you are directly supporting artists who are engaged in this work.</p>
</div><div>

<h3>This Work//It's Rewards (and ""Rewards"")</h3>
<p>This work has helped me to rebuild and refocus my attention as a maker. For my collaborators I can only hope to offer a space to think, reflect, offer alternative visions of themselves to the world, and to see one another. Most importantly, to know their own value in this process, in this world. Any rewards we've reaped will be reflected in the rewards you will receive for your donation. If you're familiar with my work, you know that the writing/drawing/sewing/zine making is as important as the dancing. By donating to this campaign you will receive some of this dance-making by product, for lack of a better term:</p>
<p>When you give $10+ you'll receive a personalized score postcard thanking you.</p>
<p>When you give $25+ you'll receive a personalized score postcard, and a score zine with illustrations and writing related to this work.</p>
<p>When you give $50+ you receive a postcard, zine and a pocket calendar featuring lunar phases throughout 2019.</p>

Using an exploratory, multidisciplinary approach, Eclipses presents Greek and non-Greek classical and modern plays in collaboration with artists of various ethnicities and cultures, developing an intercultural artistic dialogue. Eclipses has performed at Cherry Lane Theater, La MaMa, NYU, the St-Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival, the LaGuardia Performing Arts Center, the National Hellenic Museum of Chicago, the Hellenic Cultural Center in New York, the Greek Cultural Center in New York and elsewhere. Recent work has featured works by Aeschylus, Anton Chekhov, Euripides, Dario Fo and the contemporary Greek playwrights Dimitris Dimitriadis, Akis Dimou, Penny Fylaktaki, Yannis Mavristakis and Michalis Reppas/Thanasis Papathanasiou, among others.</p><p> </p><h3><i><strong>Hercules: In Search of a Hero</strong></i></h3><p>In <i>Alcestis</i>, Hercules goes to the underworld and restores Alcestis to her family. In <i>Hercules</i>, he comes back from the underworld, is thrown into a god-induced frenzy and kills his own family. On the other hand, Alcestis sacrifices herself to save her family, yet she is rarely counted among the heroes of Greek mythology. That moniker is usually reserved for male warriors—men of action, adventure and death.</p><p>We see echoes of the heroic legacy of ancient Greece in modern, Western society—a society that all too often exalts aggression and the vanquishing of enemies, whether in sports, entertainment, business or politics. In <i>Hercules: In Search of a Hero</i>, we use as a launching point the two diametrically opposite actions by the prototypical Greek hero Hercules, contrasted with Alcestis' own heroic act, to explore what heroism is and could be in a modern context.

Using an exploratory, multidisciplinary approach, Eclipses presents Greek and non-Greek classical and modern plays in collaboration with artists of various ethnicities and cultures, developing an intercultural artistic dialogue. Eclipses has performed at Cherry Lane Theater, La MaMa, NYU, the St-Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival, the LaGuardia Performing Arts Center, the National Hellenic Museum of Chicago, the Hellenic Cultural Center in New York, the Greek Cultural Center in New York and elsewhere. Recent work has featured works by Aeschylus, Anton Chekhov, Euripides, Dario Fo and the contemporary Greek playwrights Dimitris Dimitriadis, Akis Dimou, Penny Fylaktaki, Yannis Mavristakis and Michalis Reppas/Thanasis Papathanasiou, among others. Hercules: In Search of a HeroIn Alcestis, Hercules goes to the underworld and restores Alcestis to her family. In Hercules, he comes back from the underworld, is thrown into a god-induced frenzy and kills his own family. On the other hand, Alcestis sacrifices herself to save her family, yet she is rarely counted among the heroes of Greek mythology. That moniker is usually reserved for male warriors—men of action, adventure and death.We see echoes of the heroic legacy of ancient Greece in modern, Western society—a society that all too often exalts aggression and the vanquishing of enemies, whether in sports, entertainment, business or politics. In Hercules: In Search of a Hero, we use as a launching point the two diametrically opposite actions by the prototypical Greek hero Hercules, contrasted with Alcestis' own heroic act, to explore what heroism is and could be in a modern context. Our play poses a number of questions: What counts as heroism in our time? Is an act heroic if it involves violence? What is the place of women in the modern mythology of heroism? Do we need to create new mythologies?Conceived and directed by Ioanna Katsarou, the production features a new English translation of excerpts from Euripides' Alcestis and Hercules by Demetri Bonaros and original music by Costas Baltazanis. When and WhereWe will perform Hercules: In Search of a Hero from January 24 to February 10, 2019 at the Abrons Arts Center: 466 Grand Street (at Pitt Street) in Manhattan's Lower East Side .

<h3>In Brief...</h3>
<p>Nothing To Declare Productions was founded in 2018 by Rosie Fleeshman and Alex Slater. Our debut production 'Narcissist In The Mirror'  is playing for the full month at this year's Edinburgh Fringe in The Pleasance Courtyard following a sellout and award winning run at various theatres across the country. </p>
<p>Over the past year and a half we've funnelled every penny from every performance along with a host of other ridiculous events, quizzes and poetry nights into getting the show to Edinburgh. We've managed to raise nearly every penny through our endeavours (a lot of which we know we stand to not get back) and need your help clearing the final hurdle. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're not really sure how, but somehow by running Harry Potter quizzes, Friends quizzes, hosting poetry events, performing at poetry events and with the ticket sales from the show thus far, we've managed to raise almost every ounce of our budget, that said we're still doing it on a bit of a shoe string. We don't yearn for caviar or Kristal, we don't wish to ride to Edinburgh in a horse drawn carriage, we simply wish to be able to fix things if they break and  travel back home once the show is done. </p>
<p>We purposely set a small target as we didn't want to have to set up a crowd funder at all, but as it stands we're a couple of weeks away and we're still a little way from covering all of our basic costs, including van hire, travel costs and marketing.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>In exchange for your support, large or small, you receive a huge thank you from ourselves for the world to see along with the knowledge that you're assisting a newly formed company find its feet. Depending on your pledge you can also receive a unique token of our appreciation, created by us for you as a way of saying thank you a little differently. </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We really want to spend the rest of our lives making things. We reckon it's as selfish as it is selfless. We like making things. We also like making people think, making people laugh, entertaining and enlightening, sparking dialogue. Hopefully with the things we make we can make peoples lives a little better for an hour or a little more at a time. Hopefully after this show we will be able to self sustain our creative endeavours 100% of the way. For now it's only 95%, but we hope that with your help this year we will be able to make the transition before next year comes around.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The vast majority of theatre companies do not go to The Edinburgh Fringe with the goal of making money, maybe with the exception of Jimmy Carr, Shit Faced Shakespeare and a select few others. We're quite aware that there's a good chance we may lose money, we'll be happy to break even, ecstatic to make any. This isn't why we're going. Our first production has done better than we could have ever expected and for us taking it to The Fringe was never a question of 'if', rather 'how'. It's an invaluable experience for a new company to make connections, spread awareness of their brand and their product and a chance to make mistakes, learn, grow and develop as individuals and as a collective. We aim to come back from The Fringe stronger, smarter, tighter, wiser, better connected and invariably - exhausted. </p>

<h3>THE PLAY</h3>
<p>Jonno is a beloved Canadian radio host, recently published novelist, and self-proclaimed feminist. Jonno also violently abuses his sexual partners.  As the details of his aggressions threaten to become public knowledge Jonno desperately tries to rationalize his abusive behaviour to himself and to the people around him. Meanwhile, the women he has attacked struggle to find the ‘correct’ response to their assault. Angry, visceral, and disturbingly funny, the play takes an honest look at the violence perpetuated against women, and forces a light onto the men who engage in it.</p>
<p><i><strong>JONNO </strong></i>was written by playwright Alix Sobler as a direct response to a sexual assault scandal that sent shockwaves through the Canadian entertainment industry back in 2014. In 2016, the play was produced by Echo Theatre at the Winnipeg Fringe Festival, and received rave reviews from critics and audience members alike. In January 2018, <strong><i>JONNO</i></strong> will receive its Toronto debut at the Next Stage Theatre Festival.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THIS PRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Although initially written in response to a particular set of events, <strong><i>JONNO</i></strong> is fuelled by a more general conversation on victim-blaming, consent, and feminism-- and over the past few months, the need for that conversation has never been more apparent. Society is becoming increasingly concerned with the question of how to advocate for survivors and how to condemn their assaulters. Through our production of <i><strong>JONNO</strong></i>, we hope to create a space in which to foster this discussion.</p>
<h3>THE FUNDING</h3>
<p>Rabbit in a Hat Productions is a small company with limited funds. We rely primarily on ticket sales and private donations to support the work we create. The money raised by this campaign will help us cover many of our expenses, including rehearsal space rental, purchasing production materials, and marketing and promotional materials.</p>
<p>Because of the difficult nature of the subject material that we are tackling in this production, we feel that it is necessary to create a safe space after our performances for our audiences to unwind, process their experience, and discuss the contents of the show with the cast and crew. Organizing these debriefing sessions comes at additional cost to us, but we feel that they are invaluable. Your donations will help us offer an environment that is as safe and as welcoming as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, a large portion of your donation will go straight to the artists involved in this production. All of our actors and designers are professional artists who make a living off of the work that they create. The more money we raise here, the more we are able to give back to them.</p>
<h3>YOUR SUPPORT</h3>
<p>Support from donors like you is integral to creating indie theatre in Toronto. Independent theater helps give voice to those who aren't always heard, and raises questions that aren't often asked. By donating to this campaign, you are helping us tell a story that we feel desperately needs to be told, and driving a vital conversation about sex, abuse, and power forward. And-- above all else-- your donations will ensure that the artists involved are getting properly compensated for their work.</p>
<p>To thank you for your donation, the team at Rabbit in a Hat Productions is offering some pretty great perks. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name recognition online and in our program</li>
<li>Free tickets to our production</li>

<li>A copy of the script, signed by the playwright</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We love this community and we want to celebrate it. We think the best way to do that is to invite new stories to commingle with the fantastic theater community that already exists in Boise. Campfire Theatre Festival will take place September 15th-17th, 2017 at Boise Contemporary Theater. There will be staged readings, guest artists, workshops and other events to engage with these incredible artists. We hope to create an ""around the campfire"" feeling to share these stories from across the nation and from right at home in Idaho.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $3000 to make this festival be the best it can possibly be. Your donation will go to getting the word out, taking care of artists, and increasing our production value. We want these plays to get the attention they need and deserve in order to produce some riveting work. </p>
<p>You can get anything from a sticker to a behind-the-scenes meet and greet. But more importantly, you will be giving to this community and be helping grow the arts scene in Boise.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe the world needs more empathy. It's too easy to disregard other people because they feel different. Our festival is trying to produce work that creates understanding for others, and hopefully, our festival attendees will take that compassion and spread it to all corners of their lives. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the challenges is how do we actually diversify the perspectives we represent? To achieve those goals we've reached out to playwrights across the country, but we feel we can take this a step further. We would like to bring actors, directors and other artists in from across the country to participate. That will cost us a lot in housing and flights. We don't want to do this festival with the bare minimum requirements and any money you give will help achieve something that truly diversifies our festival. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can contribute financially, but there are other ways you can help. Specifically, we need a plethora of volunteers to help run the festival. If you would like to volunteer you can email our technical director at caitlin@campfiretheatrefestival.com</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
We love this community and we want to celebrate it. We think the best way to do that is to invite new stories to commingle with the fantastic theater community that already exists in Boise. Campfire Theatre Festival will take place September 15th-17th, 2017 at Boise Contemporary Theater. There will be staged readings, guest artists, workshops and other events to engage with these incredible artists. We hope to create an ""around the campfire"" feeling to share these stories from across the nation and from right at home in Idaho.

What We Need & What You Get
We need $3000 to make this festival be the best it can possibly be. Your donation will go to getting the word out, taking care of artists, and increasing our production value. We want these plays to get the attention they need and deserve in order to produce some riveting work. 
You can get anything from a sticker to a behind-the-scenes meet and greet. But more importantly, you will be giving to this community and be helping grow the arts scene in Boise.

The Impact
We believe the world needs more empathy. It's too easy to disregard other people because they feel different. Our festival is trying to produce work that creates understanding for others, and hopefully, our festival attendees will take that compassion and spread it to all corners of their lives. 

Challenges
One of the challenges is how do we actually diversify the perspectives we represent? To achieve those goals we've reached out to playwrights across the country, but we feel we can take this a step further. We would like to bring actors, directors and other artists in from across the country to participate. That will cost us a lot in housing and flights. We don't want to do this festival with the bare minimum requirements and any money you give will help achieve something that truly diversifies our festival.

<p>The New Theatre Presents <strong>My Name is Rachel Corrie</strong>, directed by <strong>Megan Carney </strong>and edited by <strong>Katharine Viner </strong>and <strong>Alan Rickman. </strong>The show, starring <strong>Shannon Ferber</strong>, was previously staged at <strong>UCD Dramsoc </strong>and at the <strong>Irish Student Drama Awards</strong> where Shannon was nominated for Best Actress. Everyone involved in the show met in <strong>UCD Dramsoc</strong> and this is our first professional show, staging in <strong>The New Theatre </strong>in July 2017. </p>

<h3><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h3>
<p>We are a group of theatre-makers who met in <strong>UCD Dramsoc</strong>.</p>
<p>We are:</p>

<p><strong>Seán O’Neill </strong>VISUAL DESIGN ARTIST</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why This Show Is Important</strong></h3>
<p>We are all extremely passionate about this piece, and constantly inspired by Rachel Corrie and her desire for change. Many years on, her thoughts and diary entries resonate with many current issues in the world today.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Corrie </strong>was an American activist who was a member of the Pro-Palestinian group <strong>International Solidarity Movement (ISM)</strong> and was killed trying to block an Israeli bulldozer in <strong>Gaza</strong> in 2003.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the state of Israel, there have been a number of accusations of <strong>human rights violations </strong>carried out against Palestinians both in Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. According to <strong>Amnesty International</strong>, Israeli forces have unlawfully killed Palestinian civilians, including children, and the authorities have continued to promote <strong>illegal settlements </strong>in the West Bank. Israeli forces have blockaded the Gaza Strip and demolished homes of Palestinians in the West Bank, forcibly evicting residents and restricting Palestinian’s freedom of movement. Israeli forces have used <strong>excessive force</strong> against Palestinian demonstrators, and so far, Rachel Corrie’s family’s attempts to gain justice for their daughter have been unsuccessful. However, it is important to note that the conflict is two-sided.</p>
<p><strong>“If any of us had our lives and welfare completely strangled and lived with children in a shrinking place where we knew that soldiers and tanks and bulldozers could come for us at any moment, with no means of economic survival and our houses demolished; if they came and destroyed all the greenhouses that we’d been cultivating for the last however long do you not think, in a similar situation, most people would defend themselves as best they could?”</strong></p>

<p>The story of <i>Say Her Name: The Lives That Should Have Been</i> begins in May 2015, when mothers of Black women slain by police were convened for the first time in New York City for AAPF's #SayHerName Vigil in Union Square, launching a five-year journey of community building, political organizing, and relentless demands for justice. The play, written by Kimberlé Crenshaw, G’Ra Asim, and Julia Sharpe-Levine in 2019, is based on five years of interviews with this group of women, now called the #SayHerName Mothers Network.</p>
<p>The plot entangles the stories of six women victims of police violence and their mothers to weave a tapestry of intergenerational loss, grief, resistance and rebirth. </p>

<p>Friends, </p>
<p>What a 24 hours it has been! Thank you so much. Yesterday I received the shocking news, reported in the Los Angeles Times, that five members of the <i>FERGUSON</i> cast were walking out because of my ""conservative"" politics and their desire to rewrite the script. I won't rewrite the truth.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1412016/files/20150424093357-LATimes-Logo-1.gif?1429893237"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>But then you stepped up and sent donations and offers of support. Last night we hit our $93K target, but even more important we've had offers of help from actors across the country. One actor offered to fly himself in from Chicago--at his expense--so he could perform in this important work.</p>
<p>I'm going to be honest. The cast leaving is a crisis. It's tough and stressful, and I had a two hour meeting with the remaining cast members last night--as others were threatening to leave. I don't know how many more walkouts there will be, but I'll let you know as soon as I hear.</p>
<p>But rest assured: the <i>FERGUSON</i> Play will have its world premiere in Los Angeles on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Obviously these last minute walkouts have been incredibly disruptive, so I need your help again to ensure the show goes on. I need $8,000 more to meet the extra costs. It's not easy to rework an entire show at the last minute. </p>
<p>Please buy a ticket or make a donation. With your help the play will be performed on Sunday night and the world is going to know the truth about Ferguson.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Phelim<br/> </p>=====================================================<br/>=====================================================<br/> <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for having a look at the <i>FERGUSON</i> play. I think this is one of the most important projects I've ever done. I have an opportunity to bring to the stage the truth about what happened in Ferguson, Missouri the morning police officer Darren Wilson shot dead Michael Brown. The truth is full of shocks and surprises, but it is unbelievably compelling. Below I have answered some of your questions. Please let me know all your other questions through the Indiegogo comments section.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p><i>Phelim</i></p>

<p>The purpose of <i>FERGUSON</i> is to reveal the truth about what really happened on August 9, 2014 in Ferguson, MO and to look at why and how the Grand Jury came to the decision they did. <i>FERGUSON</i> is a staged version of the Grand Jury testimony <b>exactly</b> as they heard it. But this time the audience gets to be the Grand Jury. The performances in Los Angeles will be dramatized staged readings with interactive voting. Every night the audience will  decide who's telling the truth, decide who's lying, and decide if they would indict Darren Wilson for the shooting of Michael Brown. How will you vote?</p>

<p> </p>
<p>A lot of people lied about what they saw that day. They lied to support both sides. They lied to the media, they lied online, and they lied to investigators. Many admitted this to the Grand Jury, but the media never corrected the record. </p>
<p>Most people don't know what the Grand Jury heard and most people don't know that a lot of what alleged witnesses told the media was later withdrawn or proven impossible by evidence uncovered in the Grand Jury room.</p>

==========================================================================================================
 


LA Weekly said FERGUSON ""made for a riveting spectacle and comes as a reminder both of the adversarial dramatic power that is inherent in any courtroom testimony and how even the dry language of a legal transcript can come alive when placed in the hands of skilled actors."" ... ""an incendiary evening of theater."" ========================================================================================================== 

Friends, 
What a 24 hours it has been! Thank you so much. Yesterday I received the shocking news, reported in the Los Angeles Times, that five members of the FERGUSON cast were walking out because of my ""conservative"" politics and their desire to rewrite the script. I won't rewrite the truth.


But then you stepped up and sent donations and offers of support. Last night we hit our $93K target, but even more important we've had offers of help from actors across the country. One actor offered to fly himself in from Chicago--at his expense--so he could perform in this important work.
I'm going to be honest. The cast leaving is a crisis. It's tough and stressful, and I had a two hour meeting with the remaining cast members last night--as others were threatening to leave. I don't know how many more walkouts there will be, but I'll let you know as soon as I hear.
But rest assured: the FERGUSON Play will have its world premiere in Los Angeles on Sunday night.
Obviously these last minute walkouts have been incredibly disruptive, so I need your help again to ensure the show goes on. I need $8,000 more to meet the extra costs. It's not easy to rework an entire show at the last minute. 
Please buy a ticket or make a donation. With your help the play will be performed on Sunday night and the world is going to know the truth about Ferguson.
Thank you,
Phelim ========================================================================================================== Hi,
Thanks for having a look at the FERGUSON play. I think this is one of the most important projects I've ever done. I have an opportunity to bring to the stage the truth about what happened in Ferguson, Missouri the morning police officer Darren Wilson shot dead Michael Brown. The truth is full of shocks and surprises, but it is unbelievably compelling. Below I have answered some of your questions. Please let me know all your other questions through the Indiegogo comments section.
Thank you,
Phelim

The purpose of FERGUSON is to reveal the truth about what really happened on August 9, 2014 in Ferguson, MO and to look at why and how the Grand Jury came to the decision they did. FERGUSON is a staged version of the Grand Jury testimony exactly as they heard it. But this time the audience gets to be the Grand Jury. The performances in Los Angeles will be dramatized staged readings with interactive voting. Every night the audience will  decide who's telling the truth, decide who's lying, and decide if they would indict Darren Wilson for the shooting of Michael Brown. How will you vote?

A lot of people lied about what they saw that day. They lied to support both sides. They lied to the media, they lied online, and they lied to investigators. Many admitted this to the Grand Jury, but the media never corrected the record. 
Most people don't know what the Grand Jury heard and most people don't know that a lot of what alleged witnesses told the media was later withdrawn or proven impossible by evidence uncovered in the Grand Jury room.
 
 

 
FERGUSON shows there were lies on all sides of the story. It will show how prosecutors AND the jury asked tough questions of all sides and revealed layer by layer the truth of what happened that morning.
I am a journalist. I'm only interested in what really happened. This is a story that deserves to be told. And FERGUSON shows the audience something the media won't: The Truth. You get to decide what you would do with that information.

At the same time audiences experience an internal connection to the surrounding event as a voice “inside their head” give live private commentary to each audience member via an ear-piece.  Audiences travel in pairs, seeing the same events but hearing different versions of each story. Both editions had amazing press and the Bucharest one brought us the Jury Award at The Romanian Independent Theatre Festival. This time because of our venue collaborator, we are taking the concept and re-imagining it in a way that we are so excited to share with you! We have invited France Damian to join us from Berlin. Big announcements coming soon!What We Need & What You Get!We are presenting Broken City: Wall St in July and INSIDE in the late fall. PopUP Theatrics has a history of producing innovative concepts that are ambitious in scope with almost zero budget. Our efforts have not gone unnoticed and we do have some grant funding in place but it does not cover everything. That’s where you come in! We hope to raise $5000 through this campaign to cover the budget shortfalls in getting our international artists to New York and housing them. But it will make possible our plane tickets, accommodation for our three international artists and the hire of local support staff. We also need to buy costumes, props and other necessary items for the show.Your $10 will buy a prop, $50 helps to cover our local artist stipends and $1000 helps with renting an apartment in New York City for our international artists.  In return, we’ve created some fun ways to say thank you and for you to experience the shows even if you won’t be NYC to see them. Beginning in July we will be posting notes, photos and videos almost daily!  You’ll get to know the whole team of amazing international and local artists we’re working with.  You'll feel as if you're virtually right here with us. We are also going to thank you on Facebook and Twitter and our website...a lot!  The funding from this campaign will go towards production costs for both Broken City: Wall Street and INSIDE. Please share the word!Not everyone can be active financially, but everyone can be involved! So if you can't contribute now please consider making a bit of noise about our show and this campaign.  Like our campaign on IndieGogo and Facebook, post this link to your Facebook profile or twitter feed!  Tell ALL your friends and most importantly, come see us! Tickets for Broken City: Wall St are on sale now!

<p>
</p>
<p>Sci-Fest LA has successfully funded our two previous
festivals, but every year is a roller coaster of challenges.  Like all ""first-of-their kind"" arts festivals, we have reached our
crucial “Third Year.”  This is usually
the “make or break” year when momentum and enthusiasm have built to a fever
pitch and it’s now up to the creators to find a sturdy base of financial
support if the festival is to continue on its mission to explore strange new
worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations!  <strong>We believe our festival has the potential to
grow into LA’s premier annual sci-fi event.  We
thank you for your support and deeply appreciate your participation in our
extremely cool new festival.</strong>  </p>

<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>Prince Tamino goes on a quest to rescue his true love Pamina, daughter of the mysterious Queen of the Night, accompanied by love-sick bird catcher Papageno, who also happens to desperately be finding a match. They travel together to the temple of the great wizard Sarastro and must decide whether to follow the ways of the dark or the light. All of this nonsense is told through the beautiful music of Mozart and the comedic interpretation of the singers and new English adaptation of the libretto by director Michealla Cipriani.</p>

<h3>What We Need to Get the Show Up and Running!</h3>

<h3>What's the Vibe here?</h3>
<p>A post-apocalyptic, beach themed, multimedia experience...""DEAD BEACH!!!"" explores the intersection where youth, pop culture, angst, and art are weapons in the futile battle against the march of time—all crammed into terse, energetic ear worms that are sure to raise the dead.  Part underground rock show, part dance off, part raucous beach party. Nobody will be able to resist the contagious movement! Everyone is welcome. Everyone should feel that they're part of the party here at ""DEAD BEACH!!!""</p>
<h3>The Relevance.</h3>
<p>After the devastation felt throughout the world in the wake of COVID, we need art and community now more than ever.  I want to be able to provide an artistic empathetic experience to as many people as I can, and this is my way of achieving that to the best of my ability… to leave something that would continue to inspire young queer artists that challenges the existing precept of what theatre can be. ""DEAD BEACH!!!"" Is a version of the world I want to see. Humans coming together finding a sense of community, experiencing love and loss together, and learning to not stress about the past or worry about the future…but rather to live in the ellipsis of the present moment.</p>
<h3>What's my deal?</h3>
<p>Greetings Party People! I'm Jake Corcoran, a New York based choreographer, dancer, and musician.  Since graduating from The University of Northern Colorado in 2015, I have been both working professionally as a Dancer as well as refining the ways in which I can communicate a narrative through movement in my own works.</p>
<p>I’ve always been anxiously conscious of the 27 club. Not to say that I’ve felt artistically comparable to the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Amy Winehouse, or Kurt Cobain…but rather in the sense that if I were to be taken that soon, what art would I have created to then be left in this universe? How do I want my artistic legacy to be remembered? Wasting no time, I called up my band mates and best friends to start creating the music and dance of what would eventually become ""DEAD BEACH!!!"" The original intent (back in the summer of 2018) was: “What would a soundtrack to the end of the world sound like?” We always hear about the idea of a post-apocalypse; we believe that even after catastrophe there is some world that continues on. Little did we know just how potent this message would become in the years that followed and here we are.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>We’re Allegro Dance Company, and we’ve been working hard on a new choreography we want to share with the world! Instead of just recording a live show, we want to push our creativity by turning this choreography into a dance film we can release for free to the public.</p> <p>Art is increasingly being consumed over the internet, and we want to join this new, wide-reaching stream of talent. Making this film will allow us to reach a global audience while also using a new medium to sculpt the way our dance style is viewed.</p> <p>Allegro Dance Company is a collaborative effort, drawing company members from a diverse group of local talent. Each dancer brings their own unique artistic flair, dance training, and organizational skills to co-create choreographies and full narrative shows. It is also a labor of love, as company members pay for their own costuming and studio rentals.</p> <p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>We need $2,500 in part to pay a videographer for their equipment, time, and expertise. Hiring a fellow artist and paying fair prices is a big part of Allegro’s equity values- Artists supporting Artists!  Funds also go towards paying for our costuming, studio rentals, and other production costs; Allegro has spent thousands of dollars on these expenses as a company, and funds from this campaign will help offset those personal costs. </p>
<p>We have a wide range of perks! We’re offering dance drills and dance conditioning videos, bookmarks, a T-shirt grab bag, and more. If you’re feeling extra generous, your donation to our campaign could even bring us to perform at your next Pacific Northwest event!</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will use the money raised to pay for filming and wait until we’ve raised more funds to pay for editing costs. Funds raised will still go to the film, the release will just be delayed!</p>
<p>$2,500 is our goal, but if the world is kind and we’re able to raise over that, we’ll be able to make a second film later this year!</p> <p><strong>The Impact</strong></p> <p>What this will do for us:</p>
<p>So much access to creating or enjoying art is restricted by money, and while making a dance film puts the financial burden on us, it releases our audience from it.</p>
<p>As dance evolves, Allegro Dance Company evolves with it. Individually, we train in multiple dance genres and we are passionate about sharing our collective fusion!</p>
<p>This could be the start of many beautiful dance films to come!</p>

<p><strong>In A Nutshell</strong></p>
<p>For over eighteen months we’ve been working on Butcher, one of the finest new Canadian plays to hit the scene in years, written by one of the county’s most exciting voices, Nicolas Billon.</p>
<p>Butcher deals with a huge question of justice - what kind of punishment really fits the crime.  The play is about the unraveling of an intriguing mystery of identity: Inspector Lamb is working the Christmas Eve shift when an old man named Josef is left on the station's doorstep – drugged, wearing a Santa cap and with a butcher's hook hanging around his neck.  A lawyer is called in to help figure things out as well as a translator eventually.  What ensues is no less than shocking and challenging in every way.  </p>
<p>Our theatre coop Prime Cuts was formed primarily to produce this play, which we have been invited to showcase at The Cultch in Vancouver, March 2018.    Our troupe is comprised of extremely accomplished theatre professionals who believe in this project and are committed to making the Vancouver run the finest production.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The perks we’re offering include everything from having a listing or advertising in our playbill, and social media to dinner with the cast and director.  We will promote the businesses and individuals through our marketing, translating into thousands of views.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Nicolas Billon’s play Butcher comes at a time when we are struggling with pain and reconciliation, collectively and as individuals.  The abuse of power is prevalent in our global community and tears at the very fabric of Western society, Canada being no exception.  This play addresses issues from our national struggles to those of Me, Too.  Butcher is an expression of Canada’s finest, having been professionally produced in all major Canadian cities to date except Vancouver.   We are so fortunate to have being invited to perform this play to on the main stage of the Cultch, meaning that we have to provide a production that looks like it belongs there.   We just want to make sure our set masters the space and that we have everything we need to tell the story.</p>
<p>When you walk into the doors of the major Canadian book store chain, Indigo (formally Chapters), on Broadway and Granville, there is a huge message that says “The World Needs More Canada.”  Our answer is “Here you go!”  With your help, we can share this cutting edge Canadian play at its full potential.   It's entertaining and ethically challenging and will bring to our community a powerful theatrical experience to be proud of!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Help us realize our goals.  We’d love your support to do so – it will make our production be exactly what it should be – from the set to the crew.   Please share this campaign with everyone you know on all the social media platforms you can! </p>

Wonderland with many events, exhibitions, conferences, and collaborations. This
unprecedented public offering culminates in Alice150 Week in New York, October
2 through 11. Among the many exciting theater events and museum exhibitions and
films and more are a few things that specifically are both open to the public
and are costing the LCSNA far more to put on than we normally spend on events
and meetings. First is the Alice Live! exhibition at the New York Public
Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. It will be free to the
general public and will reach 100,000 people with great information and
entertainment, and will do more than almost any aspect of Alice150 to bring
everything Carrollians and Alice enthusiasts love about this extraordinary
story to the most people possible. The second aspect of Alice150 that involves
expenses well beyond our usual undertakings is the conference itself. There are
two conference days at the Grolier Club focusing on translations, two at NYIT
on many different topics, and one at NYU on Alice in popular culture, plus a
reception on Saturday night. These conferences will be attended by people from
dozens of countries and will be an explosion of ideas and energy around Alice.
The space, the reception, and other conference logistics need funding to keep
them open and inclusive. All of Alice150 is receiving wonderful media coverage,
so effects are spreading far beyond the actual exhibitions and events. Alice150

We are Ella Cuda / Whitney Casal :
Two recent post-graduates, navigating the world as freelance artists, primarily through dance. For the first time we are setting out to produce a full length work, culminating as a show in late September in the 2016 Philadelphia Fringe Festival!

We strive to cultivate an artistic community, in a way that will perpetuate it to thrive. We love to share dance and aim to provide a unique experience for our audience.  




Why donate?

Some may currently be experiencing the mayhem of life at 23, an artist in this economy, or a woman in 2016. Through Coffee?  we aim to connect individuals on a comprehensive level, highlighting themes of personal growth, young adulthood, gender, relationships and self doubt. Coffee?  makes these topics accessible via storytelling (verbal and dance), and our own personal, collective experiences.  We hope that sharing our intimate moments of self reflection can create questions for our audiences about themes we feel too often get glossed over. 


By supporting this project you can help us achieve the following:
Cost of production includes application fees, cost of venue, marketing, photography, and printed materials. Plus, the piping hot, local coffee we'll have available to you at the performance.

<h3>Dracula needs your help!</h3>
<p><i>‘Dracula’ meets ’39 Steps’ meets ‘Black Adder’ in this hilarious take on a well-loved classic, by Danny Wainwright and Daniel Hallissey.</i></p>
<p>Let Them Call It Mischief make bold, imaginative and energetic theatre, and we're ready to  bring our retelling of Dracula to life at this year's Edinburgh Fringe. Following sell-out London runs of <i>The Alchemist</i>, <i>The Final Revelation of Sherlock Holmes</i>, and <i>A Christmas Carol</i> (to name but a few), we're hoping to delight Edinburgh audiences with our personal brand of mischief-making theatre. HOWEVER, we need your help...</p>
<p>Creating theatre is expensive - there are no two ways about it. We aim to raise funds to provide a fair wage for our cast, who have already given countless hours to this project out of the goodness of their hearts (and their desire to make mischief). We wouldn't have had a hope of staging this show without our actors and production team all working for no financial reward, but it has always been our aim to pay our team a fair wage, and this is where you come in.</p>
<p>Your financial support will display your dedication to unsubsidised theatre and to paying creatives a fair wage for their work. You will, essentially, be championing our actors in their efforts to bring you new and exciting theatre, and you will (of course) be rewarded with a wonderful selection of prizes for doing so!</p>

<h1>Who We Are</h1>
<p><span>Tempest in a Teapot Productions is a young theater company comprised of artists inspired by a need to tell stories, especially from voices that are commonly quieted. Our work is deeply collaborative, and we aim to engage the audience in a way that is both challenging and enlightening; daring audiences to leave the theatre with a new perspective on the world around them. We believe in taking big risks and saying yes to opportunities, and this next production is no exception!</span></p>
<br/>
</div><h3>What is <i>Valhalla</i> About?</h3><div>
<span>This play is a full-throttle, hilarious epic about the search for beauty, and the web it weaves with madness, love, and desire. We follow two parallel characters: King Ludwig II of Bavaria (nicknamed the ‘Mad King’ for his obsession with opera and constructing fairy tale castles), and James Avery, a radical teen growing up in 1940’s-era Texas. Through their shared obsession with finding true beauty, the two learn just how much is at stake when you finally get exactly what you've always wanted.</span><br/>
</div><div><span><br/></span></div><h3>Why <i>Valhalla</i>?</h3><div>
<p><span>The characters in this play are relentless and fearless in their pursuits of what they truly want, and this spirit connects with us at Tempest in a Teapot, as we sprint madly towards our first professional production. In addition, Valhalla discusses homosexuality not simply as the alternative to heterosexuality to draw a few laughs from the audience, but as its own concept and its connection to beauty, desire, and passion. Talking bravely about sexuality is another core value of Tempest in a Teapot’s work, and Valhalla is not shy about this topic. </span></p>
<br/>Valhalla is a play for the artist in all of us; for anyone who has ever dreamed big, then blindly and courageously followed their passion. This is a play about rebels and the lengths they go to get what they want. Artists of all kinds can relate to the passion, drive, and strength of the characters in this play. Whether you’re someone who dares people to stand on the edge of life like James, an architect of dreams like Ludwig, or even the loneliest humpback in Bavaria looking for love, you know what it’s like to search for a beauty that speaks to you. <br/>
