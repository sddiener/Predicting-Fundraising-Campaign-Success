Hello!

My name is Erick Harding and I created a card game called Legacy!

i was tired of games being over simplified and not very creative. i mean simple is good, however my mind craves something where i have to really think and explore possibilities  to come up with new and interesting things.

i really like to make people think differently.

The game itself was converted from a Role playing game i made when i was younger, and converted it over the years to a card game.

I also wanted a game where players could make money off of. i myself make money from home, and i think gamers should be able to do that as well even casual gamers.  so i am going to have 1000 dollar gift cards as tournament prizes. sorry no cash for tax reasons.

but there will be quite a lot of different cards you can get.. such as best buy, Fred Meyer, Safeway and many others. 




The Impact


I am raising money to fund the of my card game at www.legacytcg.com.

i am hoping to create a new type of card game , adventurous and creative, i want this card game to FEEL like a role playing game.

If my goal is not met the card game will still launch, but it will take quite a bit longer, as have no real job.

i have a sleeping disorder which prevents me from working a normal job, so i have to work from home. this work is unsteady at best, so i have to pretty much sell everything i own in order to pay for  programmers, artists, etc.

this Funding will help me in ways you cannot imagine.



What We Need & What You Get

What We Need & What You Get


What we need is 15,000 dollars for a Working game and legendary art. 

The prototype is almost finished and we can begin Alpha and Beta testing soon.

once this prototype is complete we can build from this and increase the mechanics of the game, get more artists, more voice actors, more everything. 

i intend to release this game on the Iphone/ipad and other devices as well as on PC and mac.

Should my goal not be reached the money will still go to the programmer to get as far as we can and i will scrape and sell what i can to try and meet the rest of the money.

well now for the fun part. the Perks!



The initial introductory set of this game has around 300 cards.  around 160 cards are going to be released upon Launch of the website.

several of those cards are completely unattainable by anyone other than investors.

i have set aside some Swag for people who are kind enough to donate for this cause.

We at Black Locust Games reached out to Indiegogo to learn more about their Indemand program. Indemand allows creators to continue raising money and build our fanbase for as long as we like with no fundraising target and no deadline limits. Basically, Indemand with Indiegogo can be leveraged as a pre-order system for successfully crowdfunded campaigns.</p><p><strong>Okay, so this is a money grab then?</strong></p><p>Not hardly. By definition a money grab is an undignified or unprincipled acquisition of a large sum of money with little effort. Black Locust Games has been in business since 2013 and this is only our second release in that time. Our first campaign funded and delivered on time you can read more about it <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1281146833/kingdom-0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. In addition, The Opulent has taken us over 18 months to create from design to where it is now. Having only 2 releases in 3 years has displayed that we are certainly not in a rush to crank out just any game and that each game we do produce, comes with our best foot forward. </p><p> Finally, The Opulent funded just enough for a very small run (1000 units) 75% of those copies are accounted for in our primary campaign. The remaining amount is not enough to meet the demands of a distribution partner so The Opulent will not be made available in game stores nationwide. We are okay with this as we enjoy growing our fan base organically and establishing direct relationships with our fans. <br/><br/><b>So does that mean no stretch goals since the project was funded?<br/></b><br/>Yes, no additional stretch goals can be obtained at this time since the game is well under production at this time with the funds raised from the campaign. However, all stretch goals that were unlocked during our primary campaign will be included with all pledged copies here!<br/><br/><b>Why is there a limit on the pledge levels?<br/><br/></b>We already put in an order for the amount of copies that we could safely print and ship with the funds from the primary campaign. All copies available on this campaign are what we will have left from the initial print run (less 10% for damages, replacements, conventions, etc.). Once these are gone we will be considered <b>SOLD OUT</b> unless future demand warrants a 2nd printing.<br/><br/> <b>Now Black Locust Games is proud to present...</b><br/><b><br/></b></p><div> <h3></h3>

the campaign.  Since then, they have been working on two new releases,

two-person team with the ability to design games all the way from the 
mechanics, to the graphic design / illustration.  They also created

<p>The Opulent is a finished, polished game with all the digital print 
files in route to the printers since the project is funded. <br/></p>
<p>We have figured out the costs and have worked it, so that we can 
offer you the cheapest price yet still make it a viable venture, and 
keep the components high in quality. Black Locust Games is a small team 
of 4, and we want to be smart in our planning and expectations. We want 
to be transparent in our communications to you, the backers. We want you
 to share our project victories with The Opulent as well as be aware of 
any obstacles that the project is facing. We are ALWAYS open to any 
suggestions and feedback as this project would not be possible without 
you.  With
 that being said, we are working with a great manufacturing company that
 has shipped successful crowdfunding projects in the past and we have 
full confidence that we can deliver the game to you in time. In any 
case, we will be happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen 
reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 99% 
complete (not including stretch goals), we don't regard this as too 
likely.</p>
<p></p> </div><br/></div>","Before we begin let's address some common questions!Wasn't this project successfully funded on another crowdfunding site?Yes it was! We at Black Locust Games reached out to Indiegogo to learn more about their Indemand program. Indemand allows creators to continue raising money and build our fanbase for as long as we like with no fundraising target and no deadline limits. Basically, Indemand with Indiegogo can be leveraged as a pre-order system for successfully crowdfunded campaigns.Okay, so this is a money grab then?Not hardly. By definition a money grab is an undignified or unprincipled acquisition of a large sum of money with little effort. Black Locust Games has been in business since 2013 and this is only our second release in that time. Our first campaign funded and delivered on time you can read more about it here. In addition, The Opulent has taken us over 18 months to create from design to where it is now. Having only 2 releases in 3 years has displayed that we are certainly not in a rush to crank out just any game and that each game we do produce, comes with our best foot forward.  Finally, The Opulent funded just enough for a very small run (1000 units) 75% of those copies are accounted for in our primary campaign. The remaining amount is not enough to meet the demands of a distribution partner so The Opulent will not be made available in game stores nationwide. We are okay with this as we enjoy growing our fan base organically and establishing direct relationships with our fans. So does that mean no stretch goals since the project was funded?Yes, no additional stretch goals can be obtained at this time since the game is well under production at this time with the funds raised from the campaign. However, all stretch goals that were unlocked during our primary campaign will be included with all pledged copies here!Why is there a limit on the pledge levels?We already put in an order for the amount of copies that we could safely print and ship with the funds from the primary campaign. All copies available on this campaign are what we will have left from the initial print run (less 10% for damages, replacements, conventions, etc.). Once these are gone we will be considered SOLD OUT unless future demand warrants a 2nd printing. Now Black Locust Games is proud to present...

<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span lang=""FR"">  Pour notre toute
première campagne, nous vous proposons de financer l’édition de trois jolies
pépées. </span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span lang=""FR""><b>  Eva</b>, <b>Lucy</b> et<b> Jess</b>
sont déclinées en trois versions : nue, en maillot de bain et habillée.
Pourquoi 3 versions?...et bien pourquoi pas ?</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span lang=""FR"">  Les versions nues,
ou anatomies, intéresseront les sculpteurs et convertisseurs amateurs, tandis
que les versions en maillot feront la joie des amateurs de jolies courbes
féminines…quant aux versions habillées elles feront de parfaites recrues pour
toute équipe de chasseuses de zombies, aliens, monstres...ou méchants garçons.</span></p></span><span><p></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span lang=""FR"">   Nous vous proposons
plusieurs plegdes afin d’acquérir une, plusieurs ou la totalité de ces
versions. Le moulage et la production en série seront effectués par le meilleur
mouleur résine en France : Historex, ce qui représente un gage de qualité.</span></p>
</span><span><p></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;""><span lang=""FR"">  Pour apporter un
peu de piquant à cette première campagne nous vous proposons également une
petite <b>tombola</b>. Chaque pledger se verra attribuer un ou plusieurs tickets et
pourra remporter une version peinte par un artiste du pinceau (Golden démon
winner).</span></p>
</span><p></p>
<p style=""line-height: normal;"">   Enfin, si la campagne atteint son objectif, nous vous réservons quelques surprises et produirons de nouvelles jolies chasseuses et bien sûr les affreux monstres qui vont avec. La campagne dure 1 mois. A l'issue, les tirages seront effectués par notre mouleur et envoyés au plus tard dans le courant du mois de septembre. Nous vous garantissons qu'il n'y aura pas de retard!!! A moins bien sûr qu'une météorite ne tombe sur les ateliers d'Historex ou que des zombies attaquent votre facteur!</p>

MP&Co: Monster, Pretty Girls and Company

  For our very first campaign, we offer
you to finance the edition of three pretty chicks. 


  Eva, Lucy and Jess are available in
three versions: naked, in swimsuit and fully dressed. Why 3 versions? Well…  Why not?
  Sculptors and hobbyist customizers
would be interested in naked or anatomical version, whereas pretty nice curves’
lovers would enjoy the bodysuit one… 
As for the dressed ones, they’d make perfect recruit for any zombies,
aliens or monsters huntresses’ team… Even bad boys huntresses’ team...
  We’re offering you
different plegdes to buy one, some or all of these
versions. Cast and massive production would be made by the best resin caster in
France: Historex, this is a great
guarantee!!


  To spice up this first campaign we also offer
you to join in a small tombola. One or some tickets would be assigned to every
pledger and you could win a painted version (by a Golden Demon Winner)!
   Finally, if this campaign reaches its goal,
we’d have some surprises in store for you and could make new pretty huntresses
and of course matching monsters.
  The campaign will last 1 month. Then copies will be casted and sent no later than September. There will be no delay ! Unless of course a meteorite falls on Historex's workshop or zombies attack your postman.




The dangerous Jess was sculpted by Stéphane Camosseto.

Once the objective of the campaign (2250 euros) will be reached we will conduct a draw and the winner will be offered the beautiful Jess painted by Sébastien Lavigne (Golden Demon winner).A second and then a third draw will be made if you unlock the stretch goals!





Once the campaign has reached to the""Founded!"" status we will start to unlock more goodies and miniatures. If we reach to:

3000 euros : we will unlock a painted dressed Lucy for the tombola (so there will not be one winner .... but two!)


4000 euros : we will unlock a new miniature.


5000 euros: we will unlock a painted Eva for the tombola (so there will not be two winners .... but three!)

Version française
  



  Pour notre toute
première campagne, nous vous proposons de financer l’édition de trois jolies
pépées. 
  Eva, Lucy et Jess
sont déclinées en trois versions : nue, en maillot de bain et habillée.
Pourquoi 3 versions?...et bien pourquoi pas ?
  Les versions nues,
ou anatomies, intéresseront les sculpteurs et convertisseurs amateurs, tandis
que les versions en maillot feront la joie des amateurs de jolies courbes
féminines…quant aux versions habillées elles feront de parfaites recrues pour
toute équipe de chasseuses de zombies, aliens, monstres...ou méchants garçons.
   Nous vous proposons
plusieurs plegdes afin d’acquérir une, plusieurs ou la totalité de ces
versions. Le moulage et la production en série seront effectués par le meilleur
mouleur résine en France : Historex, ce qui représente un gage de qualité.

  Pour apporter un
peu de piquant à cette première campagne nous vous proposons également une
petite tombola. Chaque pledger se verra attribuer un ou plusieurs tickets et
pourra remporter une version peinte par un artiste du pinceau (Golden démon
winner).

   Enfin, si la campagne atteint son objectif, nous vous réservons quelques surprises et produirons de nouvelles jolies chasseuses et bien sûr les affreux monstres qui vont avec. La campagne dure 1 mois. A l'issue, les tirages seront effectués par notre mouleur et envoyés au plus tard dans le courant du mois de septembre. Nous vous garantissons qu'il n'y aura pas de retard!!! A moins bien sûr qu'une météorite ne tombe sur les ateliers d'Historex ou que des zombies attaquent votre facteur!

Si la campagne atteint son objectif (2250 euros), nous vous proposerons de nouveaux lots pour la tombola et de nouvelles sculptures.Pour cela, il faudra atteindre:


3000 euros : nous ajouterons la version peinte de Lucy et son chat pour la tombola (du coup il n'y aura pas un, mais bien deux gagnants!!)


4000 euros : nous débloquerons une nouvelle figurine.


5000 euros: nous ajouterons la version peinte d'Eva habillée pour la tombola (du coup il n'y aura pas un , ni deux, mais bien trois gagnants!!)

possibilities!</i></span>
</h3>
<p>Honestly, the inspiration behind <i><a href=""http://www.gigi-and-lily.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gigi &amp; Lily</a></i> is an
inquisitive 4-year-old girl with an infectious smile, whom happens to be my
niece. Likewise, both my niece and Gigi share the same name as well as a love
of learning. </p>
<p>Inspired, I set out to create a kid friendly character that
would encourage children to place their thinking hats on each day. Thus,
helping them to think differently about the world around them while
learning. </p>
<p>Using critical thinking skills Gigi and her special thinking hat
Lily will teach kids how to count, read and solve simple math problems by
thinking about their environment differently.  Learning is fun when you put on your thinking
hat each day!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/306316/files/20140113132400-divider.jpg?1389648240"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/339911/files/20140130212440-AboutTheCreator_Title_01.png?1391145880"" src="""" style=""""/><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>""DREAM BIG AND SMILE DAILY!""</b></i></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; font-weight: normal;"">Before I continue I would like to </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">introduce my self. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">To begin,

<p>In this Interactive iPad app users manipulate as well as count objects
on screen in order to capture hidden numbers. Once captured each number must be
placed inside a special number jar. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/339952/files/20140130222153-Gigi_and_Number_buddies01.jpg?1391149313"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Gigi and her number buddies!</i></span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For example, players may be asked to swipe a web causing a

<p>Briefly, the images below are mock screen shots and are
the best representation of the interface design for the iPad application.

<p>Additionally, all elements on screen will react to the
users touch. Simply put if it is visible
on screen than players can manipulate it. To illustrate, users will be required
to perform various actions throughout the game such as swiping, dragging, and
tapping objects on screen. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The goal is to create an interactive world that players can manipulate as they learn. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">     </span></p>

<p>Honestly, while working on this project I have had the pleasure
of working with a talented musician as well as a gifted voice actress. </p>
<p>The official theme song for Gigi &amp; Lily was designed to
capture the characters inquisitive and playful personality. This was
captured perfectly by the artist ShiftyPop! </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Music by: </span><a href=""http://shiftypopmusician.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank"">ShiftyPop!</a><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""166"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fbigsmilegames01%2Fgigi-and-her-thinking-hat-lily&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=166&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p>

<p>Put your thinking hat on and discover a world of learning with
limitless boundaries and potential. Admittedly, while we often take the simple
act of thinking for granted it’s significance should not be lost upon us. </p>
<p>For example, early humans mastery of fire and Thomas Edison’s
creation of the first
commercially useful light bulb, took us out of the darkness and ushered in a
new world full of possibilities. </p>
<p>What caused such discoveries to come to fruition? Well, much
like Gigi &amp; Lily early humans and Thomas Edison had to put on their
thinking hats before their discoveries. Simply put they had to prepare
themselves to think about the world around them differently. </p>
<p>You can help
usher in a brave new world by creating the next generation of big thinkers. By
encouraging children to put on their thinking hats they may also learn how to
thinking differently about our world. Honestly, I <span>believe
that the way in which we think about the world around us reverberates
throughout our daily lives. You can</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> help change the world that we </span>live in<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> one thinking hat at a time. </span></p>

<p>Honestly, game development can be somewhat costly. Actually,
cost can skyrocket rather quickly! This is in large part because of various
elements like, equipment cost, developer fees, software costs as well as labor costs. </p>
<p>In fact, this is why I am seeking additional production funds.
Presently I have already invested thousands of dollars on equipment upgrades, like
software as well as a new computer powerful enough to render out the complex animations needed to 
develop the game.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, purchasing the much-needed computer and software diminished my
production budget greatly. Consequently, I am unable to pay for other production
costs such as, developer fees, labor costs associated with hiring musicians, voice actors 
and an additional 
programmer. Also<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span>hardware<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> costs for things like storage </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">devices and additional computing power are presently out of my reach.  </span></p>
<p>In sum the money requested will go directly towards these costs.

Sadly without these funds production of the Gigi &amp; Lily Learning App will soon come
to a halt. Presently, production has slowed down significantly as I attempt to
work around the budget short fall. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/366507/files/20140212133147-GigiFundingBreakdown.jpg?1392240707"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><p></p>

possibilities!

Honestly, the inspiration behind Gigi & Lily is an
inquisitive 4-year-old girl with an infectious smile, whom happens to be my
niece. Likewise, both my niece and Gigi share the same name as well as a love
of learning. 
Inspired, I set out to create a kid friendly character that
would encourage children to place their thinking hats on each day. Thus,
helping them to think differently about the world around them while
learning. 
Using critical thinking skills Gigi and her special thinking hat
Lily will teach kids how to count, read and solve simple math problems by
thinking about their environment differently.  Learning is fun when you put on your thinking
hat each day!""DREAM BIG AND SMILE DAILY!""Before I continue I would like to introduce my self. To begin,
my name is Dale Robert Kilgore, Jr and I am a digital artist with a BFA in
digital arts form Bowling Green State University (BGSU). ""Go Falcons!""Additionally, I also happen to be the chief artist, animator and
programmer for the Gigi & Lily learning app. Honestly, I could be
considered a one-man studio,
sort of like a jack-of-all-trades! Presently,
I have two iPhone apps within the iTunes store, which can be viewed here. Also,
I am the artist, animator and programmer for both apps. In sum, I
have a passion for story telling and game design. In fact my chief goal is to
create captivating games that entertain and enlighten players of all ages.Gigi & Lily's super-duper number adventure.  Gigi has a big problem. She has
lost her number buddies and needs to collect them. Join Gigi and
her super-duper thinking hat Lily as they learn how to count to ten while exploring the world around them.
In this Interactive iPad app users manipulate as well as count objects
on screen in order to capture hidden numbers. Once captured each number must be
placed inside a special number jar. Gigi and her number buddies!For example, players may be asked to swipe a web causing a
spider to revel it’s self. With the spider on screen players are asked to count
it’s legs aloud, with the aid of a friendly narrator. When the narrator and player
have finished counting a hidden number becomes visible. This continues with various
objects on screen until all ten number buddies are found. 


Gigi & Lily’s Super Duper Tree House. This is where their learning adventures begin.



App Design 
Briefly, the images below are mock screen shots and are
the best representation of the interface design for the iPad application.
However the design may change somewhat as I explore and test other designs
throughout the production process. 
Additionally, all elements on screen will react to the
users touch. Simply put if it is visible
on screen than players can manipulate it. To illustrate, users will be required
to perform various actions throughout the game such as swiping, dragging, and
tapping objects on screen. The goal is to create an interactive world that players can manipulate as they learn.      
In addition players will be given positive reinforcement as
they progress throughout the game. This reinforcement will be given with a
special list of animated words that appear on screen as well as phrases said by
the in-game narrator. Main
navigation System 
Honestly, while working on this project I have had the pleasure
of working with a talented musician as well as a gifted voice actress. 
The official theme song for Gigi & Lily was designed to
capture the characters inquisitive and playful personality. This was
captured perfectly by the artist ShiftyPop! Music by: ShiftyPop!
Additionally
players of the app will be aided in their adventure by the narration of the
talented voice actress Adoxographist. Her kid friendly voice is a perfect fit for
this learning app. Narration by: Adoxographist  You can have a big impact. 
Put your thinking hat on and discover a world of learning with
limitless boundaries and potential. Admittedly, while we often take the simple
act of thinking for granted it’s significance should not be lost upon us. 
For example, early humans mastery of fire and Thomas Edison’s
creation of the first
commercially useful light bulb, took us out of the darkness and ushered in a
new world full of possibilities. 
What caused such discoveries to come to fruition? Well, much
like Gigi & Lily early humans and Thomas Edison had to put on their
thinking hats before their discoveries. Simply put they had to prepare
themselves to think about the world around them differently. 
You can help
usher in a brave new world by creating the next generation of big thinkers. By
encouraging children to put on their thinking hats they may also learn how to
thinking differently about our world. Honestly, I believe
that the way in which we think about the world around us reverberates
throughout our daily lives. You can help change the world that we live in one thinking hat at a time. 

Honestly, game development can be somewhat costly. Actually,
cost can skyrocket rather quickly! This is in large part because of various
elements like, equipment cost, developer fees, software costs as well as labor costs. 
In fact, this is why I am seeking additional production funds.
Presently I have already invested thousands of dollars on equipment upgrades, like
software as well as a new computer powerful enough to render out the complex animations needed to 
develop the game.  
Unfortunately, purchasing the much-needed computer and software diminished my
production budget greatly. Consequently, I am unable to pay for other production
costs such as, developer fees, labor costs associated with hiring musicians, voice actors 
and an additional 
programmer. Also hardware costs for things like storage devices and additional computing power are presently out of my reach.  
In sum the money requested will go directly towards these costs.

Sadly without these funds production of the Gigi & Lily Learning App will soon come
to a halt. Presently, production has slowed down significantly as I attempt to
work around the budget short fall. 
(Lastly, in the
event that the funding goal is not reached production will continue and I will
work hard to ensure that all backers receive their proper rewards. I am committed
to finishing this project!)

<h1>General Info</h1>
<br/><p>The target market is a burgeoning mass of video game players, nerds like the GGhub ownership, developers, designers and programmers. The initial target market will be gamers from 18-49,  which comprises 53% of the overall gaming population.  The primary target market will be made up of men due to the fact that 58% of video game users are men but we also intend to exposing the Female demographic to gaming.</p>
<p>During the construction phase we will have about 3 months before we open, which will give us time to expand on our already successful online following.</p>
<p>Our following currently consists of a youtube channel with over 700,000+ views, a Facebook Group with 5,200+ followers, and a Twitch Streaming channel featuring GGHub Chelsea, the face of our franchise featured in the promo video above. It will also feature the tournaments we hold at GGhub, and the product demos as well. Our YouTube is purely dedicated to the creation of gaming related entertainment videos, put together by GGhub’s very own Evan Coad, who has a bachelors in Computer Sciences with an emphasis on Game Design. The Facebook group is a community for gamers in which trusted admins and GGhub employees will post funny and gaming related pictures, game releases etc. We eventually wish to turn the GGhub website into an online social gaming network to connect Gamers in a Facebookish way.

<p>Where do Nerds and Gamers go to hangout and socialize with their friends, that isn't a bar? The answer to that riddle is “Nowhere”. They would rather stay at home and play their favorite MMO and talk online to their close friends than go “party”.  GGhub will be the heaven for Gamers to meet with the closest friends but still enjoy what they love to do. Construction can begin within a week of being funded. Although we plan to have upwards to 30+ locations, our first location would be located in Denver, Colorado. The desire and passion for Gaming  in Denver is exploding. The need for a physical location to congregate and socialize with fellow gamers has never been more needed than right now. Online Gaming has somewhat isolated the casual/hardcore gamer alike, for the sheer reason that they want to enjoy whatever game they are playing with their friend, But the only realistic place to play the game would be at home. Due to the need of the high-end equipment, internet, and unlike the the older console games, only 1 person can play per machine. As of right now, nothing is being done about trying to bring everyone back together without sacrificing the games they love. GGhub’s 1st location will be on 16th street Mall in Denver, one of the most trafficked places in America, with over 3 million walk-bys a year. A local ISP loves the idea and is willing to give us 550 MB DLS (Download Speed normally over $4,500 a month) for $900 which makes this a very realistic idea. </p>
<p>GGhub will use nothing but the best, and most cutting edge technology and accessories when it comes to gaming. Gamers expect the best, will pay big money for the best, and will settle for nothing less. “Razer” is a very good role model when it comes to what gamers want to see, and we plan to contact them for potential partnerships once construction is under way. GGhub wants to cater to all gamers. We plan to start with 50 computers in the first store, but also have 5 Xbox Ones, 5 Playstation 4s, and 5 Wii Us for our console gamers. We also will always be upgrading and evolving as the market changes. The Sony Morpheus Project and others like it foreshadow the future of gaming with virtual reality headsets. We plan to experiment and rent them for people to use in the store. GGHub raise the bar for LAN centers and gaming cafes nationwide. We will be exposing any gamer to the very latest in equipment, internet access and networking technology in a luxurious, sleek and instantly recognizable club-like atmosphere. A lounge area for gamers to gather and enjoy their snacks from our cafe, and maybe even get some hand -held gaming in. ESports is growing exponentially in both participants and viewership. GGHub is going to be the proving ground for aspiring pro gamers, and be <b>THE </b>place to come if you want to get involved with eSports.</p>

General Info
The target market is a burgeoning mass of video game players, nerds like the GGhub ownership, developers, designers and programmers. The initial target market will be gamers from 18-49,  which comprises 53% of the overall gaming population.  The primary target market will be made up of men due to the fact that 58% of video game users are men but we also intend to exposing the Female demographic to gaming.
During the construction phase we will have about 3 months before we open, which will give us time to expand on our already successful online following.
Our following currently consists of a youtube channel with over 700,000+ views, a Facebook Group with 5,200+ followers, and a Twitch Streaming channel featuring GGHub Chelsea, the face of our franchise featured in the promo video above. It will also feature the tournaments we hold at GGhub, and the product demos as well.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Battle System:</strong> Experience a battle system that changes per character. Each character has a unique style that may not only change the appearance and information of the UI, but also completely change the game itself! The battle system has elements of a hack-n-slash and a shooter while feeling familiar to fans of Kingdom Hearts and the once titled Final Fantasy Versus 13 game. </li>
<li>
<strong>Highly detailed character development:</strong> You will obviously play as the main cast of protagonist throughout your journey of the world, however, they are not the only playable characters. In this game, you will have many chances to play as supporting cast and villains while learning about their pasts, goals, and personality. The goal is to make every character feel personal. </li>
<li>
<strong>Sidequests: </strong>While the traditional sidequests are here, I want to do something a little new with them. Added is the concept of episodes which will help to not only develop the characters involved but, provide a smaller story completely separate from the main story of the game! I plan for there to be many of these throughout the world! </li>
<li>
<strong>Beautiful nearly seamless environments: </strong>My goal is to capture the look of a real world. You will be confined to large areas in the world that will be massive and seamless. When airship travel is available you will be able to travel between continents. This is a massive world that is completely explorable! to add to this, there will be Points of Intrest which will take you on a scenic journey to amazing real-world inspired locations of wonder! </li>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic Events:</strong> Everything you do matters! Sidequests can trigger events in the world as well as simply exploring an area! During these events, you will face a variety of challenges ranging from monsters to enemy invasions!</li>

<h3>Why is this Campaign so small? </h3>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise enough funds to produce a powerful tech demo capable of showcasing what a moment of gameplay would be. The money will help me get various art assets that would make the game unique. Things like characters, vfx, foliage, etc will be purchased while I will build the entire demo from scratch. The cost of the full game is much greater and the demo produced here will help me build trust with you. I can do this! </p>

</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>While a one person team seems a little impossible for the task I present to you, the only risk here is time. I know the game I want to deliver to you and the only risk is for me. Without your support, I will build this game using my own very limited funds. What I will create will be the base for what you will get in your hands. I have a very high standard and I settle for nothing less than what I find perfect. Want you get on a disk to be perfect. The challenge I see moving forward is timing and providing all the features. My plan of attack is simply to hire someone capable of the job to help out by providing the various systems seperately. My job will be to integrate them, debug, and move forward. With goals set and regular progress reports, we can keep to a schedule and ensure the game is released on the release date. </p>

<p>I've spent 14 years working in RPG Maker on various small releases. My most popular one was a game I made back in 2009 called Eclipse Saga (original release site is no longer online). It was based on a story I wrote from the inspiration of The Labyrinth and Dark Crystal. It is a game I am hoping to bring to mobile devices and possibly consoles after Amaranthine Story Chapter One. </p>
<p><b>How much experience do you have with Unreal Engine 4</b></p>
<p>While you can track my progress via youtube, I started this campaign with about 1 year or so experience. Since then I've grown as a developer spending a lot of time learning how to create the various systems of an RPG. Today (2016) I have over 3 years experience with the Unreal Engine. </p>
<p><b>Did you mention a sequel to Amaranthine Story?</b></p>
<p>The reason I've been writing this story for 10 years is because Amaranthine Story is the story of a universe. Each Chapter is a new world, and a new story connected through various events that will grow clearer as the overall story progresses. The story is epic, well thought out, and will experiment with various genres such as Fantasy, Romance, Comedy, and Horror. You can learn a tad more about the world of <span><span><span><span>Unelma</span></span></span></span> and some potential information towards the future of Amaranthine Story by <span><span><span><span>funding</span></span></span></span> the<b> <i>Amaranthine Story: Guide to <span><span><span><span>Unelma</span></span></span></span> and Lore </i></b>tier. </p>

 The reward for funding this early stage is huge and no, you will not need to fund the future campaign unless you want to! 
 
EDIT 8/2016: 
The rewards posted here might have changed! This is because of the time passed as well as the schedules of those who were willing to help.

Risks & Challenges
While a one person team seems a little impossible for the task I present to you, the only risk here is time. I know the game I want to deliver to you and the only risk is for me. Without your support, I will build this game using my own very limited funds. What I will create will be the base for what you will get in your hands. I have a very high standard and I settle for nothing less than what I find perfect. Want you get on a disk to be perfect. The challenge I see moving forward is timing and providing all the features. My plan of attack is simply to hire someone capable of the job to help out by providing the various systems seperately. My job will be to integrate them, debug, and move forward. With goals set and regular progress reports, we can keep to a schedule and ensure the game is released on the release date.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you are an artist, Modeler, Programmer, Musician, or can offer anything that can help this game become a reality, please contact me @ liondogstudios@gmail.com. Every bit of help is a big step towards making this a reality.
 What is your previous experience in Game Design?
I've spent 14 years working in RPG Maker on various small releases. My most popular one was a game I made back in 2009 called Eclipse Saga (original release site is no longer online). It was based on a story I wrote from the inspiration of The Labyrinth and Dark Crystal. It is a game I am hoping to bring to mobile devices and possibly consoles after Amaranthine Story Chapter One. 
How much experience do you have with Unreal Engine 4
While you can track my progress via youtube, I started this campaign with about 1 year or so experience. Since then I've grown as a developer spending a lot of time learning how to create the various systems of an RPG. Today (2016) I have over 3 years experience with the Unreal Engine. 
Did you mention a sequel to Amaranthine Story?
The reason I've been writing this story for 10 years is because Amaranthine Story is the story of a universe. Each Chapter is a new world, and a new story connected through various events that will grow clearer as the overall story progresses. The story is epic, well thought out, and will experiment with various genres such as Fantasy, Romance, Comedy, and Horror. You can learn a tad more about the world of Unelma and some potential information towards the future of Amaranthine Story by funding the Amaranthine Story: Guide to Unelma and Lore tier.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What is Maze, and what is the reason for this campaign?</span></p> <p>Hello! This is Eli from TreeFall Studios! I am completely self funding this game, yet I need some funds to do a few non game related things such as upgrade equipment, that are vital to the game's success.  Also stretch goals have and will be added depending on funds, which can make the game even better. If you think this looks cool, but still ask why should I donate if the game will be completed either way? Here are just a few of the many good reasons:</p> <ul>
<li>It is basically like pre-ordering the game, there is a possibility that you will be scoring a download of the game up to a week before it even releases, cool right?  </li> <li>You will get to take advantage of special perks only available to supporters of this campaign, if you are really into TreeFall and games, you will definitely receive some great rewards!</li> <li>Although funding is not necessary, it will help in tremendous ways, the more funds received, the game can be extended with some pretty nifty new things that were not originally planned!</li>
<li>Although I have enough funds to be sustained while developing this game, funding would enhance and hasten our development. The PC I am currently working with is very old, more than 6 to 8 years old. It seems as if it is about to give out. Funds from this optional campaign will give me the ability to upgrade equipment quicker and make a better product. Less chance of losing progress:)</li> </ul>
<p>Maze is a First Person Puzzle/Adventure game in which you work your way through many different levels(mazes) to find the finish. You will collect coins, jump gaps, avoid spikes and environmental dangers, and dodge enemies in your attempt to find your way to the end of the maze.</p>
<p>*This game and it's elements are created originally and solely by Eli, not the entire TreeFall team. </p>
<p>*This is game is planned to release in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, and possibly the PEGI regions of Europe.(If funding does not exceed 3,000 then Europe will be excluded) If you do not live in one of these intended regions, it is probably safer not to donate to get a copy of the game, as it may never make it into your region.</p>
<p>*All physical rewards are only shipped to areas within the United States, if you live outside of this area, please do not select a physical reward, as you will not receive it, thank you.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Story</h3> <p>Here is a brief look at the back-story surrounding the game:</p>
<ul>In the year 2050, half-way through the century, humans have become massively lazy as they have become so dependent on technology. Different races of robots have taken the main position in leading the world. The robots do not see the point of human existence, as there contribution to their way of life is so minimal. A few humans have been selected for a training program. The program is called codename: Maze. The robots have created a series of levels that range in difficulty and challenges in order to decide whether or not humans still have the intelligence and ability to complete these puzzles. If a human can make it through all of the mazes in the program, they will spare the human race and all will be well. If no human can pass the test, their existence will come into question. </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Length?!?!?!</h3> <p>Hi there. If you have played The Letter, here are some things you should not need to worry about:</p> <ul>
<li>The content. There are tons of mazes, between multiple worlds, bonus worlds, arcade modes, and possibly a multi-player mode. The mazes also present a fun challenge that can be quite enjoyable to play through again. You can also see how your friends fare with more difficult levels.</li> <li>There is a save feature, it is greatly needed as there are many different mazes. Right now, the worlds are set up with 10 levels each. I currently have planned four different worlds, and then a bonus world. In the bonus world the levels are not tied to the story of the game, These will be creative miscellaneous levels that are very different than the rest of the levels, some levels might even shout out to other games! :D </li> <li>I do not know how long it will take to beat this game as of yet, as it is still in development, but it is a full fledged game, with a much longer length than The Letter. I am not totally sure if it will be the longest game out there for it's price point, but it is going to be a meaty experience, especially compared to what TreeFall has released in the past.</li>

</div><h3>Inspiration </h3><p>I have been getting a ton of questions on MiiVerse about my previous game The Letter. One question that keeps popping up is, what inspired you to make this game? So here is my answer to that question for Maze. When I was a little kid, my best friend Mj and I used to draw mazes all the time. We would make different levels and make them harder and harder to try and stump each other. We would see who could make better mazes and who was the smartest by figuring them all out! It was a lot of fun, I remembered how much fun we had doing it, so I decided to make it into a full 3D video game! </p><div>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Multiplayer Mode </span>
</div><p>Not totally sure if this will make it into the game, as it would take much more time to test, program and get working, but if funding exceeds $15,000, then I should be able to add a multiplayer mode! This is kinda like a stretch goal! In this mode, one player would play on the TV, while the other uses the GamePad screen! Each would be placed at different ends of the maze, (these would be custom multiplayer maps, not mazes from the main adventure mode), and each player would race to collect coins, and solve the mazes first. Depending on the map there would be environmental hazards, robot enemies, and traps! Play competitively, or cooperatively to solve these mazes with your friends! :D</p><h3>GamePad Features</h3><div>Currently the Wii U game has multiple uses in this game! One being Off-TV play, and the other being a real-time top down map shown of the each level! I am going to try and work even more features into the beastly controller as well! Rest assured you will feel the love with the Wii U GamePad.</div><h3>The Enemies</h3><div>

</div></div>","NOTICE- The game is coming to Wii U, Android, Linux, iOS, PC and Mac as long as we reach our first goal! We will also add optional control to all systems so that everyone can play the game on any system!                                Swipe Knight(working title) is a Metroidvania game controlled
with the touchscreen.
The controls are as follows:
Swipe up to jump and swipe down to slide.
Swipe in the direction the hero is walking to attack. 
Swipe in the opposite direction to turn around and walk in the other direction.
Swipe down while jumping to do a down thrust. 
And more.
Players can also control the hero with the left
analog stick in the same way as the swipes. The idea came from all these popular mobile
games like cookie run and subway surf, they have a particular addictive feel to
them.
I wanted to capture the addictive gameplay of
those games and put it in a metroidvania style setting. The result is something
truly unique.
You get the best of 2 worlds, the simple
addictive gameplay elements of a casual game taken to a whole new level mixed
with the excitement of exploring a vast world, finding new items, fighting huge
bosses and more!  It is worth pointing out is that the Wii U version
will get a couple of special worlds, bosses that take full advantages of the 2 screens and Wii U’s other unique features. To put it blank, this game is going to be made

We don’t want to give away any more of our 2

put the game on PC and Mobile as well because they don’t have a Wii U. So we
have made the decision to also put the game on iOS, Android, Linux, PC and MAC!
This is NOT going to affect the Wii U version, we are
still going to implement all the cool dual screen ideas, and we will do our
best to port the game over to the other systems. If we end up with too much
content that we can't port over to the other systems then we will make some
exclusive content for them to make up for it.                   UPDATE 2:Lot's of people have been asking to see the ""30's cartoon alley"" world. So here it is:",29.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p> We have taken a unique approach to this campaign and have already

of the game. Funding will also assist in hiring other staff to assist in
project.</p>

<h3>What is Gaming Grounds?</h3>
<p>Gaming Grounds is a tabletop gaming store located in Kent, Ohio. It is a small business that is run by two independent owners with the sole goal to establish and maintain a fun gaming community!</p>
<p>And we mean it when we say Gaming Grounds is all about the community. Anyone who walks in the door finds him or herself immediately welcomed into our little family, whether they’ve been playing these games their whole life or they’re brand new. <br/><br/>But don’t take our word for it; on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/gamingxgrounds"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">facebook page</a>, well over two dozen people have recommended our store, using words like “inviting” and “friendly” to describe us. But even we know that we can always strive to create more improvements to our store in order to increase the feelings of welcome and comfort.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re running this campaign. We want to use the money you, OUR COMMUNITY, helps us raise, to address the needs of the players. This summer has been a hot one, especially this past week with temperatures well over <strong>90 degrees</strong>!  Our players have spoken, and we have listened, and so we have created this campaign to fund the replacement of building wide air conditioning.  </p>
<p>But we need your help!  Read on to see how you can help and some of the things you can get in return for your assistance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise approximately $3,000 for a new air conditioning unit (our old one was damaged by ice and after an inspection we were informed we need an entirely new unit!).</p>
<p>Even if we don't make this goal, all money raised will go toward the investment of a new AC unit!</p>
<p>If we were to raise additional money on top of our goal, here are some more things we would like to do to create a positive and comfortable gaming location:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update lighting in our back gaming room (the Annex)</li>
<li>Re-paint the walls to create a bright gaming area</li>
<li>Complete the RPG table to provide comfort to our roleplaying patrons</li>
<li>Replace the front windows to add additional comfort during hot days</li>
<li>Provide lockers in our spare hallway so that our players can store their items during events</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div></div>","What is Gaming Grounds?
Gaming Grounds is a tabletop gaming store located in Kent, Ohio. It is a small business that is run by two independent owners with the sole goal to establish and maintain a fun gaming community!
And we mean it when we say Gaming Grounds is all about the community. Anyone who walks in the door finds him or herself immediately welcomed into our little family, whether they’ve been playing these games their whole life or they’re brand new. But don’t take our word for it; on our facebook page, well over two dozen people have recommended our store, using words like “inviting” and “friendly” to describe us. But even we know that we can always strive to create more improvements to our store in order to increase the feelings of welcome and comfort.
That’s why we’re running this campaign. We want to use the money you, OUR COMMUNITY, helps us raise, to address the needs of the players. This summer has been a hot one, especially this past week with temperatures well over 90 degrees!  Our players have spoken, and we have listened, and so we have created this campaign to fund the replacement of building wide air conditioning.  
But we need your help!  Read on to see how you can help and some of the things you can get in return for your assistance.


What We Need
We are looking to raise approximately $3,000 for a new air conditioning unit (our old one was damaged by ice and after an inspection we were informed we need an entirely new unit!).
Even if we don't make this goal, all money raised will go toward the investment of a new AC unit!
If we were to raise additional money on top of our goal, here are some more things we would like to do to create a positive and comfortable gaming location:

Update lighting in our back gaming room (the Annex)
Re-paint the walls to create a bright gaming area
Complete the RPG table to provide comfort to our roleplaying patrons
Replace the front windows to add additional comfort during hot days
Provide lockers in our spare hallway so that our players can store their items during events



What You Get
Should you choose to help us out, you will be generously rewarded depending on the amount you are able to donate!  You can always look to the right for the donation perks, but know that any amount you are able to donate will be greatly appreciated!  Everyone who donates, be it 1 dollar or 1,000 dollars, will be recognized in our special indiegogo at the end of this campaign.
Plus, you all get Air Conditioning!
The Impact
Any contribution you make will help make a difference, not only to provide a more comfortable environment, but to kick-start the development of our gaming community! Air conditioning is only the start, but it is a big project and one that many people are excited to complete.  
Gaming Grounds has always been about developing the community (as seen in our previous indiegogo) and we wont stop here.  This just helps us shift the focus and keep pushing toward our ultimate goal, the development of a successful gaming community in the Kent area that encourages all types of gamers!  With your help, we can make this dream a reality!

technologies.  The new technologies can then be applied into the blueprints of applicable components that will be manufactured resulting in better, improved items.  <br/><br/>We will cater for complete manufacturing chains.  This means that some players might specialize in the final product whilst others might specialize in manufacturing components needed by those manufacturing end products.  Players specializing in manufacturing can even make use of researchers to improve their manufacturing process over time.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy""

laboratories and hire teams of scientists to do their research for them.  The success of their research will hugely depend on the way they construct their scientist teams as well as the facilities within their research labs.  Research can be costly but the rewards can be massive if a research team has achieved a breakthrough.  <br/><br/>Almost every area in Venturia Online has a full research path that is never ending.  What we mean with never ending is that we, the developers, will add new content to be researched as technologies gets unlocked.  Also sub areas are available for researchers.  For example:  A combat robot makes use of Vanadium Steel Armor...however the weight needs to be reduced and a player can task his scientists to research lighter Vanadium Steel armor.  It might even happen that while they do their research that they have an unexpected breakthrough in another area related to what they are researching.<br/><br/>Quarantine facilities will also form part of Venturia Online.  After all we are dealing with alien technology at times as some of the loot from battlefields might contain alien artifacts.  These needs to be placed under quarantine and after a while if it is safe to remove those items it can be handed to scientists to reverse engineer, which might result in possible new technologies etc.  If an item is classified as hazardous it wont be able to be removed from quarantine and must either be destroyed OR task scientists to try and find a way to neutralize the hazardous effects it might have.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy""

decisions on.  Crops will literally grow over time, although accelerated for gaming purposes.  We are currently considering using 7 different models for each type of grain etc, representing the different stages of growth.  Some examples of items players will be able to farm with are: Grain, fruit, vegetables, cotton, sheep, cows, chickens and even wood.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy""

Commander Interface will also be available for the player in charge of the battle to plan a solid battle strategy and assist him/her in commanding other players in battle.  Items can be looted in battle and also used for resources, research and/or reverse engineering.<br/><br/>Battlefields will be broken up into sectors and players will be able to build supporting infrastructure buildings on the starting sector.  Once new sectors has been conquered players can then safeguard those sectors by building additional defensive structures for example turrets.  These captured areas should be defended as valuable resources will be available on captured sectors for harvesting etc.  Players will also be able to control their infrastructure via a Combat Control Centre located in Venturia.  Each Battle Control Station is a live camera view onto the battlefield. <br/><br/>Smaller battlefields will be available for single players that like to solo.  On the other end there will be huge battlefields to conquer that is ideal for large teams.  Once a battlefield is conquered the players can then start reinforcing it with additional defensive structures like sentry guns etc.  While a guild has control of a battlefield it will be possible to harvest resources from the battlefield and they will even be able to build mines etc.  However the more valuable the battlefield the more difficult it would be to keep it, as there will be alien attacks over time, trying to recapture the battlefield. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy""

We felt that in an online world like Venturia Online players should be able to experience player housing where they can own their own apartment.  Players will also be able to decorate their own apartments as well as manufacture furniture etc in-game, which in turn can be placed within apartments.  Thus the look and feel of each apartment will depend on each player and their preferences.Each area of game-play should have some purpose behind it and in their own apartments players will thus be able to use it to perform certain activities like cooking.  The food produced will in turn be used, by the virtual characters, to temporary boost their stats and can be even used for NPC's that a player might have hired in their factories, labs etc.  Players will be able to experiment with different ingredients to produce different types of dishes, which in turn will produce different stats.  If a new recipe are discovered it will be up to the player if he/she wants to keep the recipe a secret or not.  Thus it can be a good way or generating income once a player are a good cook in-game.


Players will be able to mine for raw ore and refine it into minerals.  Being 50 years into the future players will make use of mining robots to perform their mining tasks for them.  Mining robots in itself will vary hugely depending on the way the robot was built and configured by a manufacturer.  This will affect for instance a robots physical mining ability, carrying capacity, AI units for mining etc.  Players will be able to research into better mining technologies to build better mining robots over time.  
Ore will be refined it into minerals.  These minerals will be needed by players to manufacture items.  The refining yields depends not only on the refining skills of players but also by facilities used.  Players will be able to research into better technologies and build better refining facilities over time.  This includes better refining techniques etc.  It might be that while one player might specialize in mining another might decide to specialize in refining.  Together they might form an excellent team.Players will be able to manufacture almost all items in-game, from furniture right through to combat robots etc.  Each area of manufacturing will also have a research tree which has to be opened up over time by players doing research for better technologies.  The new technologies can then be applied into the blueprints of applicable components that will be manufactured resulting in better, improved items.  We will cater for complete manufacturing chains.  This means that some players might specialize in the final product whilst others might specialize in manufacturing components needed by those manufacturing end products.  Players specializing in manufacturing can even make use of researchers to improve their manufacturing process over time.People specializing into research will need research laboratories and hire teams of scientists to do their research for them.  The success of their research will hugely depend on the way they construct their scientist teams as well as the facilities within their research labs.  Research can be costly but the rewards can be massive if a research team has achieved a breakthrough.  Almost every area in Venturia Online has a full research path that is never ending.  What we mean with never ending is that we, the developers, will add new content to be researched as technologies gets unlocked.  Also sub areas are available for researchers.  For example:  A combat robot makes use of Vanadium Steel Armor...however the weight needs to be reduced and a player can task his scientists to research lighter Vanadium Steel armor.  It might even happen that while they do their research that they have an unexpected breakthrough in another area related to what they are researching.Quarantine facilities will also form part of Venturia Online.  After all we are dealing with alien technology at times as some of the loot from battlefields might contain alien artifacts.  These needs to be placed under quarantine and after a while if it is safe to remove those items it can be handed to scientists to reverse engineer, which might result in possible new technologies etc.  If an item is classified as hazardous it wont be able to be removed from quarantine and must either be destroyed OR task scientists to try and find a way to neutralize the hazardous effects it might have.Players will be able to own farms and perform various farming activities.  Due to the dynamic weather system we decided to take farming to another level in gaming.  A full weather forecast system will be available which players can monitor and base their decisions on.  Crops will literally grow over time, although accelerated for gaming purposes.  We are currently considering using 7 different models for each type of grain etc, representing the different stages of growth.  Some examples of items players will be able to farm with are: Grain, fruit, vegetables, cotton, sheep, cows, chickens and even wood.On the fishing side, different types of fish will appear at different locations and on different weather conditions taking fishing to a new level as well within gaming.  It might be useful for people planning to go fishing to keep track of the weather forecast as well.  Fish will be a cheap way of producing food for NPC's and players.  It might also be used in recipes to produce food dishes of higher potencies.  Battlefields are away from the city and robots can be teleported onto these battlefields.  A complete battle interface will be available for these battles in which players can control their robots in battle.  In group battles a separate (optional) Commander Interface will also be available for the player in charge of the battle to plan a solid battle strategy and assist him/her in commanding other players in battle.  Items can be looted in battle and also used for resources, research and/or reverse engineering.Battlefields will be broken up into sectors and players will be able to build supporting infrastructure buildings on the starting sector.  Once new sectors has been conquered players can then safeguard those sectors by building additional defensive structures for example turrets.  These captured areas should be defended as valuable resources will be available on captured sectors for harvesting etc.  Players will also be able to control their infrastructure via a Combat Control Centre located in Venturia.  Each Battle Control Station is a live camera view onto the battlefield. Smaller battlefields will be available for single players that like to solo.  On the other end there will be huge battlefields to conquer that is ideal for large teams.  Once a battlefield is conquered the players can then start reinforcing it with additional defensive structures like sentry guns etc.  While a guild has control of a battlefield it will be possible to harvest resources from the battlefield and they will even be able to build mines etc.  However the more valuable the battlefield the more difficult it would be to keep it, as there will be alien attacks over time, trying to recapture the battlefield. 

Venturia is a self sustaining city and get for example most of its power from the core of the earth.  Part of Venturia is located underneath the Ocean bed underground.  Some of the most important facilities will be located underground.  These underground facilities will require various levels of security clearances to visit and players can over time improve their standings, as well as security clearance within Venturia Online. The part of Venturia above the ground is an ocean city built on massive platforms.  In the centre of the city is the main building with a massive shield generator that generates a spherical shield over the entire city if an attack would occur.  This will be from time to time and an alarm will sound in the city before an attack, after which the city shields will be raised etc.  The visuals of that will be absolutely spectacular and players will even be able to see the effects of alien weaponry against the shield as they try to penetrate into Venturia.
Players can buy and sell items and/or services through a player market facility.  Players will also be able to contract other players for specific jobs, goods, service etc.  When this happens all payments will be held in escrow and once the contract is fulfilled payment will be released to the contracted player via the automated contracting system.  A NPC Market system will also be available and NPC's will also submit contracts onto the market for other players to full-fill.
Development of Venturia Online is a lengthy and costly process and although part of the team is working full time on it, we would love to get everyone working full time on Venturia Online.  We are expecting to launch Venturia Online in 2015, with the first Alpha as early as 2014.  The funding are basically to keep the team full time on the project as well as to acquire services where needed from other individuals.  One such example is for a sound specialist assisting us with creating in-game sounds etc.  Part of the funding will also go towards 3rd party software and development tools. If we don't reach our entire goal Venturia Online will still be completed and released, although it might be at a slighter later date than intended.  On the other hand, if we do surpass our goal, the additional income will still go towards the development of Venturia Online.  This will be in the form of additional content, online servers etc.  An example of such content might be additional Battlefields at launch (which are originally scheduled for after release) etc. With your help Venturia Online might be able to be completed sooner than intended, with richer in-game content.  We will also be able to launch it properly providing a better gaming experience for all involved.  We are also in the process of creating a website for Venturia Online.  Once it is up and running all contributors will be able to join the development forums for feedback as well as telling us their ideas of what they would love to see within Venturia Online.  After all...Venturia Online is developed for gamers and to be a success its essential that we should listen to the gamers.

We would appreciate it if you could get the word out and make as much noise as possible about our campaign.  We need people to use Twitter, Facebook and whatever means they have to spread the word.  Thus even if you can't  contribute, it doesn’t mean you can’t help.  We truly appreciate every effort to help us out.

<p>Recently, an independent, four-year study led by The University of Minnesota’s Maureen R.

<h3>THE DOOMBOT WEBSITE PORTAL<br/>
</h3>
<div><b>Attempting to create a new merchandise model for video games that puts the gamer in the creative driving seat!</b></div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>WHAT IS IT?</b> </p>
<p>The Doombot is an attempt to create an experimental merchandise 
marketplace and innovative new business model using crowd-funding and crowd-sourcing 
strategies and is being built by Robots to help gamers, developers and
 creatives alike to make and sell fantastic merchandise to other Robots 
(and humans). These Robots have been busy building a giant death Bot for
 years but sadly have run out of money. Since crowd-funding for a giant,
 genocidal Robot is highly unethical they've instead decided to help the
 video game industry by creating a web portal where gamers, creatives 
and developers can meet and create unique and interesting merchandise to
 be enjoyed by all!</p>
<p><b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b></p>
<p>Simply put - A gamer <i>suggests</i> an idea for a product related to his favourite game. This could be anything that we have on our books (currently 3D printed figures, laser engraved glass, t-shirts, concept art in canvass and acrylic and 3D flip lenticulars and we aim to add much much more).  A creative expert then makes a design working with the gamer to get a precise design and feel for the product then submits it through a vetting process with us and the developers. Once approved then the Gamer gets EXACTLY what he asked for and not something that's been chosen and designed for him and then mass-produced in sweat shop conditions in the Far East.<br/></p>
<p>A more in depth explanation requires talking about the benefits for the different tiers and we have different tiers for gamers, creatives and developers. </p>
<p>Gamers have a tough time when it comes to buying merchandise for their 
games. Finding the right present or next cool collectible can involve 
going to many different sites, many badly run or with a poor selection. 
 The Doombot's goal, besides total world domination, is to provide a one
 stop shop of the latest and coolest video game art and related 
products. Some of these may be rare or even unique pieces. We aim to 
make any related products available for any related games which means 
that gamers will have a huge choice of products to choose from. As well 
as this all members will have a unique ID which they can build on. So 
for instance if a member links a portrait of their face to their ID then
 we could use that to create, say a 3D printed figure from their 
favourite game with their face inserted onto it. Or add a full body 
picture and digitally insert yourself into your favourite game moments to create unique dioramas. 
The website will also get the latest news and gossip that we will be 
getting direct from developers themselves as well as have the 
opportunity for gamers to be involved in the creation of cool 
merchandise. They can comment on any and all merchandise and provide 
useful feedback for the creatives and developers.  We will also be 
holding frequent competitions, both creative and fun and sometimes even 
silly, to make sure that all members of our community are involved with 
the games and developers we will be working with. Since gaming is a 
Robots favourite past time they aim to make it as fun as possible for 
all gamers involved.<br/>Finally, and most importantly, gamers will be 
able to suggest the types of merchandise that would appeal most to them.
 If enough people are interested in a design suggestion and a creative 
makes something super cool that the developers approve of then you'll be
 able to buy it and have the warm glow of being part of a collective 
process that you've been able to influence and grow from a design idea 
to the final completed product in your hand, on your desk or hanging on 
your wall. The key thing here is that we want to build not just a 
business but an all inclusive gaming community with forums that anybody 
can join and be part of as well as a website with the framework to take 
your amazing ideas and turn them into the merchandise that you, the 
gamers, want.</p>
<p>Creatives will be given free reign to design any 
game merchandise they like with whatever materials they like for any 
developers who are linked to our site. Any creative work they do can 
then be showcased and submitted for approval to both the public and 
relevant developers. If approved then it will be added to the 
merchandise gallery and anyone anywhere can buy it! This allows artists 
to create work that gets recognition not only from your peers but also 
from developers themselves. As well as this developers can post their 
own requests for any creative work directly so we hope it could prove to
 be a useful job lot too! One of the better perks of joining us as an 
accredited artist is that you will have a platform on which to showcase 
your work to all of our users and developers as the business grows and 
have the potential to gain notice in the industry, be recognised by your
 peers and turn a profit too!</p>
<p>Developers have a tough time these days as making awesome video games is
 a lengthy and frustrating process. So the Doombot robots would like to 
make it easy for them to sell cool products based on their games with as
 much input as they want to put into it. Firstly any developers will be 
allowed to sell merchandise through our site as well as use it as a 
message board for their fans. They will also be put in touch with 
creatives such as artists, animators and any other interested
 parties who can help them create cool and targeted merchandise. They 
will be allowed to set any guidelines for those creatives to work to and
 then vet any work that those creatives make. This gives developers the 
best of both worlds in that they can utilize the Internets undiscovered 
talent to make great merchandise, have a firm but easy-going control 
over what is made and sold and what isn't and best of all they save time
 so that they can focus more fully on making their own games as 
fantastic as possible. We feel that this would be an especially good 
boon for small indie developers who may not have the resources or 
technical know-how to set-up their own merchandising programs. As well 
as this they will have an extensive range of promotional materials to 
market by as well as the expertise of creatives skilled in whatever 
particular medium they need. Finally as an added bonus since we work on a
 unit-by-unit basis it won't cost them a penny (with options to scale up
 production if required).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>HOW WILL YOU USE MY DONATION?</b></p>
<p>Your donation will be spent solely for the use of creating a website portal for video game related merchandise and promoting its use. We aim to create a modern and intuitive website that anyone can use and enjoy with a friendly community spirit and promote it any way that insane robots can think of to further its influence. The Doombot robots guarantee that they will NOT use the donation money to further their plans for human annihilation but spend it only on the website and its promotion. Creation of the website means all matters involved in getting it to work including legal counsel, servers and any additional technology that may be needed. Planned promotional events include such things as expos, parties, video game store meets, gallery viewings and more! We look to create interesting events that people feel enthused about and work with the best people possible to make them happen.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>ARE HUMANS ALLOWED TO USE THIS SITE?</b></p>
<p>Robots aren't too 
fond of humans due to their smell and the fact that they are used as 
Human slave labour. However one of the wonders of the internet is that 
we can do all of the above from the comfort of our own computers. That 
way the robots wont have to be directly involved with humans at all. 
Besides video games is one of the only things where Robots and Humans 
see eye to optical input so they've put aside their irrational hatred of
 mankind to help make a place where everyone can buy unique merchandise.</p>
<p><b>WHAT DO I GET IF I PLEDGE?</b></p>
<p>Besides a variety of gifts that you can see below, all pledgers great or small will be put on a unique list - the Founding Member List - which will give you a range of future benefits. I will be sending everyone a personal email of thanks (and I really hope I don't get a million+ pledgers). You will always get early access to new tech as and when we add it. You will also get perks such as free face-scanning and digital insertion and say, if we have a full body scanning kit at future conventions then we'll do that for you for free. As the business expands then we'll be adding more stuff such as private forums and game servers. Basically you'll be on the ground level for anything exciting that we do.</p>
<p><b>CAN WE SEE SOME PICS OF THE PLEDGE GIFTS?</b></p>
<p>Of course! <br/></p>

You will also get perks such as free face-scanning and digital insertion and say, if we have a full body scanning kit at future conventions then we'll do that for you for free. As the business expands then we'll be adding more stuff such as private forums and game servers. Basically you'll be on the ground level for anything exciting that we do.
CAN WE SEE SOME PICS OF THE PLEDGE GIFTS?
Of course! 

A wall poster and a large lenticular wall art piece signed by the artist!


A mousemat, 2 different styles of lenticular postcard and some cups!

A 6x4x4, 8x5x5 and a the big 18x15x8 inch crystal looming off screen on the right. The little key-chain on top of the middle block can light up red,blue or white.

Tired of always playing by the rules? Now you can make your own! 

Firewall is a two-player tactical board game where you get to decide the rules.

In Firewall, you command an evil army of cyber units on a battlefield where the rules of war change according to players' whims.

How it works

The aim of the game is for players to win points by taking their opponent's units. 



But in Firewall, as in all cyber warfare, there are no hard and fast rules. Players get cards that help them shift the balance of power, like by making  threatened units poisonous, so your opponent loses a point if she takes it, or by switching the direction a type of unit can move.

Combine luck with tactics in a game where no match is ever the same.

What is the money for

We believe we made a great game and we'd love to take it to the next level in terms of play and experience.  For that we need your help!

Our wish list of things we'd love to add to the game includes:

 A smart artificial intelligence that players can use to practice or for a quick match.
 A better scoreboard system like in professional Chess, and match making according to your rank.
 A cool soundtrack  to add atmosphere.
 Enhanced gameplay strategies with new rule-changing cards.
 An HD version for iPad.



and your money is what we need to accomplish these goals!


What's next

We have grand plans for more board, puzzle, and multiplayer games...

 But first we want to make Firewall the best it can be - so please help us transform our dream into a reality!

Who we are 

We're a small independent team of programmers and software designers, with day jobs in serious fields like business process management.

We're also passionate computer and board game geeks, and believe the new mobile platforms are perfect for combining and innovating in these two gaming worlds.  

Our dream is to create those games, and we have some darn good ideas! 

How else you can help

Do you have friends who:
    like iPhones?
    like board games?
    like cyber-warfare?
    hate mosquitos?

<h3>Magx in a flash</h3>
<p>Magx is a new way of mobile gaming.  With the support of our backers we'll be able to bring an awesome mobile gaming device that isn't restricted by licensing requirements or locked down where you can only do with it what the company tells you.  Android is open, Magx is open, and gaming should be open for everyone who wants to develop.</p>
<p>We haven't seen any other devices that match what we would be looking for in an Android gaming system.  There are some coming on the market, but they're not that mobile.  You should be able to fit a mobile handheld in your pocket and play it in the car and on an airplane.</p>
<p>Magx also is done with development.  We're ready to go into production!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Why Magx?</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of amazing developers out there, and when it comes down to it, they're not able to build the amazing games they're capable of because they aren't an already established player in the main mobile gaming market.  We intend to change that by giving them the hardware to match their needs.  No more having to dumb-down games because there aren't any physical buttons or controls that are needed for precise actions and more enjoyable gameplay.  No more crazy development costs associated with trying to get a new game out on a more mainstream mobile console.  If you got a great idea to make a game, then make it!</p>
<p>Magx isn't going to be a new way to play touchscreen games, it's about a new generation of games coming from anywhere and everywhere.  You don't have to package, sign agreements and contracts and hire manufacturers to create amazing mobile games anymore.  Just build it and let the world know.</p>
<p><strong>What is Magx?</strong></p>
<p>Magx is the combination of hardware and a little bit of software that bring mobile gaming straight from developers to players.  2 Analog sticks? Check! D-Pad? Check! 6 buttons that can be used in combination? You betcha!  The Magx console isn't something magical (although you would think so with that name), but what is special about it, is that it's the first time a mobile console of this caliber is being pushed through for both players and developers.  Magx is and will be rooted...always!</p>
<p><strong>Besides the console, what else is Magx going to do?</strong></p>
<p>Anything any other Android tablet can do : )</p>
<p>It's built on open source code, so anything you want to do, feel free.  Want to load a different ROM, we won't stop you.  As always, any additions we make to the system will definitely be available to the community.</p>

<p><b><span><span>Welcome to our vision to move one of the most unique MMOs into its beta stage!</span></span></b></p>
<p><span><span>The World we are trying to create will be a free MMO in which the players can decide their <b>fate</b> -- a world of swords, magic, and hints of advanced technology.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>One of the more unique aspects of The World is the <b>Chaos Gate </b>(mentioned below), a device that allows one to travel to distant, and often forgotten, lands that humans were unable to reach by normal means. Players can use the Chaos Gates to travel through dangerous<b> fields</b> and <b>dungeons</b> seeking rare and long lost <b>treasures</b>.</span></span></p>

<span><span><span><span>The<b> Chaos Gate</b> system is a keyword-based warping system inspired by the "".hack"" series, and is unique in an MMO. By providing different <b>keywords</b>, one will be warped to a unique <b>field</b> whose features are shaped by the town you have come from and the words used. What this means is that there will be countless <b>landscapes</b> and each one of them will be <b>unique</b>. Not only this, but the <b>dungeons</b> will be unique as well, as they are also based off of the keywords. Of course <b>monsters</b>, <b>bosses</b>, and treasures that are located within these maps will be vast, so <i>every trip through the Chaos Gate will be an adventure.</i></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/119962/files/20130930092459-Chaos_Gate.png?1381216582"" src="""" style=""width: 376.607px; height: 444px;""/></p></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Chaos Gate</i></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span><span>For those who may be worried about being able to <b>meet</b> other <b>players</b> on these many variations of fields, let us ease your minds. First off, if one player provides the same keywords as another player, they will be <b>together</b> on the field with that other person. </span></span><br/><br/><span><span>The Keywords do NOT create new (instanced) fields when they are used. They only teleport players to fields that are already made. In addition, we've found, through years of experience with this system, players, like with any other MMO, have preferred spots for camping and leveling. There will be, in any MMO, hot spots where you will find most players going through and leveling. For our system, that means there will be fields that are more popular then others. This is something the players can take advantage of. Over time, players who either prefer to play alone or with many other people will learn which fields to go to.</span></span><br/></span></p>

<p><span><span><b>Classes</b> are broken down into two categories: <b>Basic Classes</b> and <b>Advanced Classes**</b>. A Basic Class is what everyone will start out with. After some time spent leveling up, there will be a time where you will be able to choose your Advanced Class. Each Basic Class can choose from two Advanced Classes, each with their own unique advantages and skills. Normally, one of the Advanced Class choices will allow you to use a <b>different weapon</b> than their Basic Class. For example, a Lancer will be able to choose a Reaper, which will use a Scythe!</span></span><br/><br/><span><span>Basic Classes include:</span></span><br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The Knight, the hero determined to protect all people from the dangers of The World.</span></li>
<li><span>The Thief, the stealthy class that specializes in acquiring treasures.</span></li>
<li><span>The Wavemaster, a mage with magic symbols that make use of powerful spells to take down their foes.</span></li>
<li><span>The Blademaster, a balanced class in all respects, cleaves through their enemies with giant swords.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lancer, a nimble spear and staff master who uses far-reaching attacks at blinding speeds.</span></li>
<li><span>And lastly... The Runecaster! A gunner who uses a special gun to shoot cartridges imbued with powerful magic at their opponents.</span></li>

<span>Another important aspect of our game, especially for one of our staff members, is the <b>story</b>**! No world can be made to be interesting without a <b>rich, deep history</b> that sets itself apart from other worlds. Although there are many things that make a game, we believe that a complex and meaningful story is what sets our game apart from many others. </span><br/><br/><span>The most interesting part of an MMO of any kind is that the show must always go on. Unlike many games, where, if the story ends, the game ends; we plan to continue creating <b>amazing stories</b> that the players will go through as they venture through our world.</span><br/><br/><span>There will be two different <b>story lines</b> within The World. One that is easy, but <b>mandatory</b> to continue on your adventure, and another that will be an <b>optional story line</b> that is both challenging and rewarding. </span><span>A small example of one of the stories is about a time when you meet a fellow adventurer, who soon becomes your <b>mentor</b>, aiding you throughout your quests:</span><br/><br/><p><i><span>You discover the <b>legend</b> of a powerful treasure that has been untouched by man. As you travel through the dungeon rumored to contain the treasure, you are attacked by <b>two powerful-looking cloaked men</b>. Try as you may, you fail to fend them off and your mentor is <b>killed</b>. You decide to take responsibility for what happened and embark on a quest for <b>revenge</b>, but we guarantee you it becomes far<b> more</b> than that!</span></i></p>
<br/><p><span><span>Of course, there will be plenty of other <b>quests</b>! We have designed a large number of quests, each with their own path, each telling a tale of their own. Some quests are simply<b> fun</b>, designed to challenge a player or a group, but many other quests expand to include <b>gaining knowledge</b> of The World which cannot be found in the main story of the game. These include further understanding of the <b>landscape</b>,<b> ruins</b>, the many <b>towns</b>, and even <b>monster tribes!</b></span></span></p>
<span><span>An example of these would include fighting what are known as the <b>Elemental Deities</b>. Only through optional side quests can you unlock these amazing battles and the rewards that follow.</span></span><br/><br/><span><span>Finally, one of the most unique features in this MMORPG is a system in which </span></span><b>everything is affected</b><span><span> by everything else. Players will become able to have a massive </span></span><b>influence on the environment</b><span><span> around them. Not only this, but, when left alone, the monsters themselves will help shape the surrounding area, leading to several </span></span><b>surprises</b><span><span> that await unsuspecting players. Remember, this is a </span></span><b>world</b><span><span>, and we plan to treat it as such.</span></span><br/><br/><span><span>**The back story can be found on our Website. To sum it up, The World is allowed rotate by the actions and creations of the Twin Goddesses, Aura and Luna, for through them several deities were created.</span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/102827/files/20130929153523-Heading_5.png?1380494123"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<span><b>The World</b> is a huge place that has remained unexplored for thousands of years. Only recently has the human race gathered enough strength and knowledge to expand their reach beyond their<b> towns</b>, <b>cities</b>, and <b>strongholds</b>. </span><br/><br/><span>Together, the human race has slowly begun to expand, and is discovering the <b>ruins</b> of races that have long since disappeared. Many of these ruins and <b>dungeons</b> contain dangers that most people cannot even imagine. For those brave enough to be willing to take the risk, however, the reward will surely be great.</span><br/><br/><span>Using the <b>Chaos Gate</b>, players can explore large <b>landscapes</b> which are characterized and shaped by the different <b>elements</b>. Some areas included are: </span><br/><ul>
<li><span>Frozen Tundras</span></li>
<li><span>Relaxing Beaches</span></li>
<li><span>Trecherous Mountains</span></li>
<li><span>Beautiful Forests</span></li>
<li><span>Arid Deserts</span></li>
<li><span>Chaotic Volcanoes</span></li>
</ul>
<span>Hidden on these massive </span><b><span>fields</span></b><span> are the ruins of ancient races and </span><b><span>castles</span></b><span> that have long since been </span><b><span>abandoned</span></b><span>. Within these dark corridors and stairways are powerful </span><b><span>creatures</span></b><span> that now call these structures their new homes. If an adventurer is lucky, they may also find, beyond the dangers, a </span><b><span>rune statue</span></b><span> guarding long forgotten </span><b><span>treasures</span></b><span> such as sacred armors and rare weapons.</span><p><span class=""notranlsate""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/119955/files/20130930093257-Monster.png?1381216091"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Monster Concept</i></i></p>
<span>These dungeons are not the only <b>dangers</b> players should be wary of. Some <b>monster tribes</b> have prospered above the ground, building makeshift <b>fortresses</b> and <b>bases</b> to further their reaches. Finally, there are rumors of strange lands and structures that <b>defy all reason</b> and lack any logical explanation.</span><br/><p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/102828/files/20130929153555-Heading_6.png?1380494155"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<span><span>Atop the many <b>features</b> of the game we've covered so far -- the environment surrounding the players -- we understand the value and importance of <b>player to player</b> interactions. <b>Guilds</b> will be in the game; they are <b>player made</b> and will have a vast number of functions to aid groups venturing through The World. </span></span><br/><br/><span><span><b>Groups</b> will be able to take advantage of many options to help <b>organize</b> and spread their guild throughout the lands. Guilds can even compete for <b>special fortresses</b> and <b>bases</b> located on various fields, and ward off those who try and <b>invade</b> them.</span></span><br/><br/><span><span>Another aspect of player to player interaction is <b>Player versus Player combat</b>, or <b>PvP</b>. There will be PvP <b>interaction</b> within The World, but not everywhere. We understand the important line that exists between players who play for PvP and those who may not prefer it, and we have always worked to please both sides. We have come to the conclusion that the more dangerous areas (<b>PvP areas</b>) will contain some higher level treasures. We see a nice balance from adding an<b> extra danger</b> in finding the most desired of weapons and armor. </span></span><br/><br/><span><span><b>PvP</b> will not be limited to free range slaughter. <b>Tournaments</b>, both official and player made, will be available to the users. Eventually, other PvP additions will be created; like <b>Sieges</b>, for example.</span></span><br/><br/><span><span><b>Player versus Environment interactions</b>, or (<b>PvE</b>) will also be expanded beyond quests and story lines. We, the developers, love <b>armies</b>. We want the player to be able to experience all out <b>war</b> with various monster types, protecting or wiping out various monster races from strongholds for rewards. </span></span><br/><br/><p><b>Elements</b></p>
<span>In both <b>PvP</b> and <b>PvE</b>, we, as a team, have decided to add what we believe to be a unique feature: the power of the<b> elements</b>. Although many MMOs put very little stress on things such as ""fire beats wood"", and ""wood beats water,"" we plan to encourage our players to use their<b> elemental advantage</b> against their enemies! Monsters, weapons, and bosses stress the importance of the element they are powered by. </span><br/><br/><span>There will also be a concept built around <b>Elemental Crystals</b>. All <b>weapons</b>, starting out, have a neutral base with basic weapon skills. However you can make your weapon stronger by <b>forging</b> an Elemental Crystal to give the weapon elemental skills and bonus damage. Although, once forged onto a weapon, they cannot be removed; these powerful new weapons will give much needed help to players on their quests.</span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/119986/files/20131008003500-replacement.png?1381217700"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

This of course, will pour into The World, so prepare for a scare!</span><br/><br/><b><span>Gato, Lead Programmer</span></b><br/><span>Gato has worked along with Lee for many years on small projects for fun. Gato has not stopped pouring countless hours and hard effort into this project, continuing to out-do himself with every small update he makes.

Thank you everyone for your donations! with 7 days to go we are excited to see all the support we've had so far! We have a small present for you to be upload shortly and in addition we convinced Lee Keramory to share his own personal Lost Ground with the community if we hit 5k! We also convinced him of something special as well to have the community create together if the full 6k is matched! Something about the community creating their own Lost Ground together! Thank you all again for your support!

Welcome to our vision to move one of the most unique MMOs into its beta stage!
The World we are trying to create will be a free MMO in which the players can decide their fate -- a world of swords, magic, and hints of advanced technology.
One of the more unique aspects of The World is the Chaos Gate (mentioned below), a device that allows one to travel to distant, and often forgotten, lands that humans were unable to reach by normal means. Players can use the Chaos Gates to travel through dangerous fields and dungeons seeking rare and long lost treasures.
Players can also relax in towns, converse with other players, and prepare for their next adventure through local shops or even in their guild bases. If a player decides not to fight, they can enjoy other activities, such as raising Neko pets and fishing. Only the most powerful of adventurers will be able to unlock the secrets of The World, and, perhaps, be the key to its salvation.Platforms: Windows - Mac - Linux - MobileThere is almost nothing that you will not be able to do within The World!

The Chaos Gate system is a keyword-based warping system inspired by the "".hack"" series, and is unique in an MMO. By providing different keywords, one will be warped to a unique field whose features are shaped by the town you have come from and the words used. What this means is that there will be countless landscapes and each one of them will be unique. Not only this, but the dungeons will be unique as well, as they are also based off of the keywords. Of course monsters, bosses, and treasures that are located within these maps will be vast, so every trip through the Chaos Gate will be an adventure.Chaos Gate
For those who may be worried about being able to meet other players on these many variations of fields, let us ease your minds. First off, if one player provides the same keywords as another player, they will be together on the field with that other person. The Keywords do NOT create new (instanced) fields when they are used. They only teleport players to fields that are already made. In addition, we've found, through years of experience with this system, players, like with any other MMO, have preferred spots for camping and leveling. There will be, in any MMO, hot spots where you will find most players going through and leveling. For our system, that means there will be fields that are more popular then others. This is something the players can take advantage of. Over time, players who either prefer to play alone or with many other people will learn which fields to go to.


Classes are broken down into two categories: Basic Classes and Advanced Classes**. A Basic Class is what everyone will start out with. After some time spent leveling up, there will be a time where you will be able to choose your Advanced Class. Each Basic Class can choose from two Advanced Classes, each with their own unique advantages and skills. Normally, one of the Advanced Class choices will allow you to use a different weapon than their Basic Class. For example, a Lancer will be able to choose a Reaper, which will use a Scythe!Basic Classes include:

The Knight, the hero determined to protect all people from the dangers of The World.
The Thief, the stealthy class that specializes in acquiring treasures.
The Wavemaster, a mage with magic symbols that make use of powerful spells to take down their foes.
The Blademaster, a balanced class in all respects, cleaves through their enemies with giant swords.
The Lancer, a nimble spear and staff master who uses far-reaching attacks at blinding speeds.
And lastly... The Runecaster! A gunner who uses a special gun to shoot cartridges imbued with powerful magic at their opponents.



Lancer Concept**There is more information on classes as well as their advanced options to be found at our website and forum.

Another important aspect of our game, especially for one of our staff members, is the story**! No world can be made to be interesting without a rich, deep history that sets itself apart from other worlds. Although there are many things that make a game, we believe that a complex and meaningful story is what sets our game apart from many others. The most interesting part of an MMO of any kind is that the show must always go on. Unlike many games, where, if the story ends, the game ends; we plan to continue creating amazing stories that the players will go through as they venture through our world.There will be two different story lines within The World. One that is easy, but mandatory to continue on your adventure, and another that will be an optional story line that is both challenging and rewarding. A small example of one of the stories is about a time when you meet a fellow adventurer, who soon becomes your mentor, aiding you throughout your quests:You discover the legend of a powerful treasure that has been untouched by man. As you travel through the dungeon rumored to contain the treasure, you are attacked by two powerful-looking cloaked men. Try as you may, you fail to fend them off and your mentor is killed. You decide to take responsibility for what happened and embark on a quest for revenge, but we guarantee you it becomes far more than that!
Of course, there will be plenty of other quests! We have designed a large number of quests, each with their own path, each telling a tale of their own. Some quests are simply fun, designed to challenge a player or a group, but many other quests expand to include gaining knowledge of The World which cannot be found in the main story of the game. These include further understanding of the landscape, ruins, the many towns, and even monster tribes!
An example of these would include fighting what are known as the Elemental Deities. Only through optional side quests can you unlock these amazing battles and the rewards that follow.Finally, one of the most unique features in this MMORPG is a system in which everything is affected by everything else. Players will become able to have a massive influence on the environment around them. Not only this, but, when left alone, the monsters themselves will help shape the surrounding area, leading to several surprises that await unsuspecting players. Remember, this is a world, and we plan to treat it as such.**The back story can be found on our Website. To sum it up, The World is allowed rotate by the actions and creations of the Twin Goddesses, Aura and Luna, for through them several deities were created.


The World is a huge place that has remained unexplored for thousands of years. Only recently has the human race gathered enough strength and knowledge to expand their reach beyond their towns, cities, and strongholds. Together, the human race has slowly begun to expand, and is discovering the ruins of races that have long since disappeared. Many of these ruins and dungeons contain dangers that most people cannot even imagine. For those brave enough to be willing to take the risk, however, the reward will surely be great.Using the Chaos Gate, players can explore large landscapes which are characterized and shaped by the different elements. Some areas included are: 
Frozen Tundras
Relaxing Beaches
Trecherous Mountains
Beautiful Forests
Arid Deserts
Chaotic Volcanoes

Hidden on these massive fields are the ruins of ancient races and castles that have long since been abandoned. Within these dark corridors and stairways are powerful creatures that now call these structures their new homes. If an adventurer is lucky, they may also find, beyond the dangers, a rune statue guarding long forgotten treasures such as sacred armors and rare weapons.

Monster Concept
These dungeons are not the only dangers players should be wary of. Some monster tribes have prospered above the ground, building makeshift fortresses and bases to further their reaches. Finally, there are rumors of strange lands and structures that defy all reason and lack any logical explanation.

Atop the many features of the game we've covered so far -- the environment surrounding the players -- we understand the value and importance of player to player interactions. Guilds will be in the game; they are player made and will have a vast number of functions to aid groups venturing through The World. Groups will be able to take advantage of many options to help organize and spread their guild throughout the lands. Guilds can even compete for special fortresses and bases located on various fields, and ward off those who try and invade them.Another aspect of player to player interaction is Player versus Player combat, or PvP. There will be PvP interaction within The World, but not everywhere. We understand the important line that exists between players who play for PvP and those who may not prefer it, and we have always worked to please both sides. We have come to the conclusion that the more dangerous areas (PvP areas) will contain some higher level treasures. We see a nice balance from adding an extra danger in finding the most desired of weapons and armor. PvP will not be limited to free range slaughter. Tournaments, both official and player made, will be available to the users. Eventually, other PvP additions will be created; like Sieges, for example.Player versus Environment interactions, or (PvE) will also be expanded beyond quests and story lines. We, the developers, love armies. We want the player to be able to experience all out war with various monster types, protecting or wiping out various monster races from strongholds for rewards. Elements
In both PvP and PvE, we, as a team, have decided to add what we believe to be a unique feature: the power of the elements. Although many MMOs put very little stress on things such as ""fire beats wood"", and ""wood beats water,"" we plan to encourage our players to use their elemental advantage against their enemies! Monsters, weapons, and bosses stress the importance of the element they are powered by. There will also be a concept built around Elemental Crystals. All weapons, starting out, have a neutral base with basic weapon skills. However you can make your weapon stronger by forging an Elemental Crystal to give the weapon elemental skills and bonus damage. Although, once forged onto a weapon, they cannot be removed; these powerful new weapons will give much needed help to players on their quests.
Elemental Weapons Concept


Our development team have known each other for many years, mostly through the same website we grew up with as gamers and developers. Although we developed different professional paths, we all agree that our true desire is to design games, and we will not stop until we are able to do just that.The Staff:Lee, The World Producer.Lee has been a dedicated artist and storyteller throughout most of his life and through the development process. Although Lee is not as tech savvy as the rest of the team, he has pulled through with great 3D models and amazing concepts for the game. He has a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and is currently working at a mental health center. His dream is to create a great video game, then move on to the horror genre of gaming, hoping to pull at peoples heart strings as they play. This of course, will pour into The World, so prepare for a scare!Gato, Lead ProgrammerGato has worked along with Lee for many years on small projects for fun. Gato has not stopped pouring countless hours and hard effort into this project, continuing to out-do himself with every small update he makes. He has pushed the game as far as it has gotten today, and helped maintain the dedicated community we have.Axl, Lead Texture/Interface DesignerAxl has continued to be a strong member of various .hack communities and eventually stumbled on this project a while back. Using his artistic talents he has helped reshape how the game looks and feels. To top it off he has also created the current forums and website, which are both fantastic.Brian, Gameplay DeveloperHaving a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics, Brian has helped shape the battle mechanics and balancing in not only the classes themselves but all around combat and interactions. He is also constantly aiding in the physics of the game as well. Like all of us, he hopes to turn his skills into a long time profession of video game development.
Allen, Cinematographer/Web DeveloperAllen has spent many years editing and creating videos. He then took his interest and talent professionally by developing his skills with the tools and foundation necessary. He contributed his editing skills into a community based project that he enjoyed being a part of. Combined with his editorial skills with other staffs directional and animation talents, together they've created wonderful cut-scenes rivaling what many would expect from professional gaming.


Your money will be used to push this game from a very early alpha into its beta stage. Your pledge will be used to shape this world by giving us the ability to have magnificent:


Music: so that not a single field or town will be dull, Animations that breathe life into the characters that inhabit The World
Beautiful 3D Models that can bring you joy in the simplest of moments.
Game changing Plugins that allow us to extend the features this game has to offer while speeding up development further.
Stunning Textures that compliment and expand the beauty of every model.

Quests and Stories that consist of grandiose epics that will inspire you not only to read them, but also to be involved emotionally.
A Server back-end that can hold up against thousands of users interacting in a dynamic world.

Effects that call forth constant amusement and awe.
And Gameplay that is not only well thought out, but also fun.



Some examples of assets, textures, and music this will provide:

New, professionally made character models, customizations and outfits.
Full featured and easy to use GUI.

Beautiful and expressive magic/skill effects for all classes.
Lush flora, fauna, and scenery to cover the environment in lovely detail.
Tools to make it easy to host large, unique, and fun live events.
Fast paced and exciting combat that lets players feel the thrill of battle during each encounter.
Cut the development time down to a fraction of what’s currently required.
100+ fields to explore and unlock.

Open Source MMO
Working on creating an MMO has been a long and difficult journey. At the time of its inception, when The World was only a dream - we had no idea that this game would require so much from us, and, while we have enjoyed the journey so far, we would like to make the path easier to travel for teams in the future -- since very few solutions exist for gamers and indie developers looking to achieve their dreams of creating an mmo aside from dedicating their entire lives to a project. We hope to help fill this void by offering our game's code as an Open Source Project to the developer community; along with examples and documentation, we hope that gamers and developers alike can spend less time worrying about code and spend more time creating their dream worlds.


There is a lot of extra features we would love to add into our game to make it ready for production faster. That being said, however, even with our funding request at $6,000, there is still a limit of what we can do!
Every time the funding from you, the contributors, increases the amount funded past a certain threshold, we can add extra content into the game. Although we have a lot more content planned than what is listed, these are some of the things we guarantee will make it into our game if we get enough funding!
$7,000 - An extra pre-game service before logging into The World that will be built into the patcher.

We believe adding this technology will allow players to experience interaction in a whole new way. [Emotiv integration will be done when the new SDK releases in 2014 if stretch goal is met.]$12,000 - Oculus Rift functioning with The World. Reaching this goal will allow us to put resources towards integrating The World with the amazing Oculus rift, which will provide player's with a 3D environment that they can view naturally. Along with emotiv, this will allow us to create an immersive experience like none ever seen in an mmo.

You might recognize me from my recent Kickstarter campaign Forbidden Sanctity! This was also a Wii U title but it was revealed a little too early and required a lot of funds to complete the project! As of now the project is deemed too far behind to reach it's funding goal! So for now, I will be developing this smaller Wii U exclusive and have it delivered to you all on the Nintendo eShop within a few months! It is a much smaller project with a very reasonable funding goal! At the same time that I am working on this project, my team and I will continue to work on Forbidden Sanctity and relaunch in soon! </p><ul>
<li>This game is a exploration and narrative based horror game for the Nintendo Wii U. Michael Kennedy is a young boy who receives a letter from his father who recently took an ""off the books"" construction job in a strange valley down the road from their Mountain Home. In the letter the father explains that he is probably already dead by the time his son receives the letter. Michael has no idea what is going on with this new construction team or this hidden valley, but he loves his father and will do anything to try to save him.</li>
<li>This campaign is extremely important to me and my team as it will allow us to grow in experience and grow our company. This title will be available in just a few short months for all Wii U owners to play if we can reach our goal! There are not too many games out for the Wii U yet, especially mystery horror games and we hope to shake up the landscape of the game selection with our newest title! We needed a title that was almost guaranteed to release on the system and soon for people to play and enjoy!</li>
<li>With contributor's help, you will give me the ability to upgrade to all the proper equipment to create a better and complete version of this game for the Nintendo eShop to try and make a difference on the market!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Funding Goals &amp; Game Results</h3><ul>
<li>I need around 5,000 dollars to successful create and distribute this game! The funding will mainly be going towards the payment of the Wii U engine, but I am not allowed to say exactly what it costs! I am a licensed Nintendo Developer, but do not have the funds to pay to keep the Wii U game development engine. So if TreeFall Studios is going to put out Wii U games, we need the funding. The funds will also support myself and my team as we work to relaunch Forbidden Sanctity and start future projects.</li>
<li>We have cool perks for contributors to collect! The digital perks will be available for anyone in the world to receive! However, at the moment the game is scheduled to release for Nintendo of America, and no other regions however it is possible it will come to Nintendo of Europe later! Some of the perks given away will be computer wallpapers, digital soundtracks, and free game downloads! If you are interested in this game at all, there will be a good perk out there waiting for you!</li>
<li>This is a flexible campaign and if the goal is not met, the funds will still go towards completing this game! Development on this game has been going really well so far, and it needs the full funds to see completion, if not all the funds are raised, the collected funds will be used to finish the game and the engine will be payed for by some other means! So no matter what, I will finish this game and have it on the eShop for your enjoyment if funds are raised, completed or not! </li>

This was also a Wii U title but it was revealed a little too early and required a lot of funds to complete the project! As of now the project is deemed too far behind to reach it's funding goal! So for now, I will be developing this smaller Wii U exclusive and have it delivered to you all on the Nintendo eShop within a few months! It is a much smaller project with a very reasonable funding goal! At the same time that I am working on this project, my team and I will continue to work on Forbidden Sanctity and relaunch in soon! 
This game is a exploration and narrative based horror game for the Nintendo Wii U. Michael Kennedy is a young boy who receives a letter from his father who recently took an ""off the books"" construction job in a strange valley down the road from their Mountain Home. In the letter the father explains that he is probably already dead by the time his son receives the letter. Michael has no idea what is going on with this new construction team or this hidden valley, but he loves his father and will do anything to try to save him.
This campaign is extremely important to me and my team as it will allow us to grow in experience and grow our company. This title will be available in just a few short months for all Wii U owners to play if we can reach our goal! There are not too many games out for the Wii U yet, especially mystery horror games and we hope to shake up the landscape of the game selection with our newest title! We needed a title that was almost guaranteed to release on the system and soon for people to play and enjoy!
With contributor's help, you will give me the ability to upgrade to all the proper equipment to create a better and complete version of this game for the Nintendo eShop to try and make a difference on the market!
Funding Goals & Game Results
I need around 5,000 dollars to successful create and distribute this game! The funding will mainly be going towards the payment of the Wii U engine, but I am not allowed to say exactly what it costs! I am a licensed Nintendo Developer, but do not have the funds to pay to keep the Wii U game development engine. So if TreeFall Studios is going to put out Wii U games, we need the funding. The funds will also support myself and my team as we work to relaunch Forbidden Sanctity and start future projects.
We have cool perks for contributors to collect! The digital perks will be available for anyone in the world to receive! However, at the moment the game is scheduled to release for Nintendo of America, and no other regions however it is possible it will come to Nintendo of Europe later! Some of the perks given away will be computer wallpapers, digital soundtracks, and free game downloads! If you are interested in this game at all, there will be a good perk out there waiting for you!
This is a flexible campaign and if the goal is not met, the funds will still go towards completing this game! Development on this game has been going really well so far, and it needs the full funds to see completion, if not all the funds are raised, the collected funds will be used to finish the game and the engine will be payed for by some other means! So no matter what, I will finish this game and have it on the eShop for your enjoyment if funds are raised, completed or not! 
The game has only been in development for a few weeks and it is starting to turn out nicely! We hope you enjoy these early in-editor shots of the game!8,000 DollarsIf we raise more than the goal, it will extend the length of the game and make the game's quality much better than before!

<strong>Oki Doki Boats</strong><strong> is a game which simulates the ocean fishing.</strong>

<p> <strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What we wish to accomplish?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The game is in its beginning stage. In the end we want to have a better resemblance to Hard Truck relating the distributing of cargo. In Oki Doki Boats this system will involve catching different species of fish and selling them or offering a certain ammount of it in exchange of rewards when the player finishes a task.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The world of the game will offer a lot of islands with many docks from which the player can get tasks. In these docks one can find NPCs which offer jobs for different companies.</strong></p>

<p>=======================================================</p>
<p>Olá pessoal! Queria dizer que o Indie Go Go foi uma experiência incrível que nos trouxe muitas coisas boas, como novos parceiros, grandes notícias, muitos comentários positivos  e em especial o apoio das pessoas que curtiram a proposta. Infelizmente, o processo era muito mais complexo do que supúnhamos, e não deu tempo de fazer uma boa divulgação. Então, com base no que aprendemos, vamos planejar minuciosamente uma nova campanha com melhor material promocional, demos, mais prêmios e uma divulgação ampla pré-programada. Daremos continuidade ao processo iniciado aqui até podermos concluir o jogo. Mas aqueles que contribuíram desde já  ganharão um prêmio especial supressa exclusivo, aguardem! Muito obrigado novamente a todos que nos tem dado força, nos veremos em breve! Acompanhe  as <a href=""http://renan.tk/donate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">novidades</a></p>

<h2>O game revolucionário de realidade virtual que coloca você dentro de um apocalipse zumbi!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>=======================================================</p>
<p>Olá pessoal! Queria dizer que o Indie Go Go foi uma experiência incrível que nos trouxe muitas coisas boas, como novos parceiros, grandes notícias, muitos comentários positivos  e em especial o apoio das pessoas que curtiram a proposta. Infelizmente, o processo era muito mais complexo do que supúnhamos, e não deu tempo de fazer uma boa divulgação. Então, com base no que aprendemos, vamos planejar minuciosamente uma nova campanha com melhor material promocional, demos, mais prêmios e uma divulgação ampla pré-programada. Daremos continuidade ao processo iniciado aqui até podermos concluir o jogo. Mas aqueles que contribuíram desde já  ganharão um prêmio especial supressa exclusivo, aguardem! Muito obrigado novamente a todos que nos tem dado força, nos veremos em breve! Acompanhe  as <a href=""http://renan.tk/donate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">novidades</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>======================================================</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Dentro do Horror Game</h3>
<p>You Are Surrounded é um horror game de realidade virtual (VR) pra iOs e Android que vai mudar seus conceitos sobre gameplay para sempre. O tablet (ou smartphone) funciona como uma janela 1-1 para um ambiente virtual repleto de zumbis famintos.  O jogador literalmente gira 360 pra olhar ao redor e aponta o dispositivo para cima ou para baixo, mirando sua “arma” na direção almejada, igual um tiroteio real e visceral.  Treine sua mira e reflexos, viva um verdadeiro apocalipse zumbi pela primeira vez!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>E para não deixar nenhum fã dos horror games de fora You Are Surrounded também faremos uma adaptação para <strong>Windows Phone</strong> e <strong>PC</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Curta nossa página no <em><strong>Facebook</strong></em> e seja <em>tester</em> do game =)</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/YoureSurrounded"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Facebook""><img alt=""Facebook"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://renan.tk/indie/face.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Facebook""/></a></p>

<p><span lang=""en""><span> </span></span></p>
<h3>Sinta o Medo em Primeira-Mão</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Você pode se mover fisicamente pra se desviar de mordidas: o jogo detecta sua aceleração linear pelo fluxo ótico da câmera. Dê alguns passos no mundo real para andar no mundo do jogo, nenhum joystick é necessário (só opcional). Não entre em pânico, desvie das criaturas e mate-as, explore salas pequenas e escuras, colete itens ensanguentados, resolva puzzles mortais. Você adentra no novo mundo do jogo como um pesadelo – uma imersão incrível em um VR zombie game muito a frente do seu tempo.  Sinta na pele a adrenalina!</p>
<p>Além disso, o game implementa uma tecnologia inovadora de otimização para gerar gráficos ultra-realistas (inspirados em <strong>Call of Duty MW</strong>) mesmo hardwares móveis limitados.</p>
<p>Sombras no chão te avisam quando um zumbi está se aproximando atrás do seu pescoço. Usando fones de ouvido, você pode ouvir gritos e passos ensandecidos vindos da esquerda ou direita e girar rapidamente atirando. Use seus sentidos para sobreviver como nunca antes em um game.  </p>
<p>Realismo, controles, sons, ambientação, todos os elementos de game design estão lá para você finalmente saber como você se sentiria em uma experiência de estar cercado por mortos vivos e lutar pela sua sobrevivência.</p>

<h3>Nós Amamos Imersão de Verdade.</h3>
<p>Nós amamos a imersão oferecida por controles de movimento, desde as <strong>pistolas laser</strong> dos árcades até tablets,<strong> Wii</strong> e<strong> Kinect</strong>. Nesse sentido, You Are Surrounded permite você progredir ativamente em uma habilidade relevante de tiro como um esporte físico. A sensação de realidade virtual é como um <strong>óculos head-tracking futurista</strong>, porém imediatamente acessível.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Nós Amamos Zumbis</strong></h3>
<p>E nós amamos zumbis, como tantas outras pessoas. O mundo e as situações do game são fiéis ao clima de produções como <strong>The Walking Dead</strong> e os <strong>filmes do Romero</strong>. O gameplay provoca pânico como<strong> Resident Evil 4</strong> e medo como <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong>.</p>

The revolutionary virtual reality game that transports you into a zombie apocalypse.
 
=======================================================
Olá pessoal! Queria dizer que o Indie Go Go foi uma experiência incrível que nos trouxe muitas coisas boas, como novos parceiros, grandes notícias, muitos comentários positivos  e em especial o apoio das pessoas que curtiram a proposta. Infelizmente, o processo era muito mais complexo do que supúnhamos, e não deu tempo de fazer uma boa divulgação. Então, com base no que aprendemos, vamos planejar minuciosamente uma nova campanha com melhor material promocional, demos, mais prêmios e uma divulgação ampla pré-programada. Daremos continuidade ao processo iniciado aqui até podermos concluir o jogo. Mas aqueles que contribuíram desde já  ganharão um prêmio especial supressa exclusivo, aguardem! Muito obrigado novamente a todos que nos tem dado força, nos veremos em breve! Acompanhe  as novidades

Dentro do Horror Game
You Are Surrounded é um horror game de realidade virtual (VR) pra iOs e Android que vai mudar seus conceitos sobre gameplay para sempre. O tablet (ou smartphone) funciona como uma janela 1-1 para um ambiente virtual repleto de zumbis famintos.  O jogador literalmente gira 360 pra olhar ao redor e aponta o dispositivo para cima ou para baixo, mirando sua “arma” na direção almejada, igual um tiroteio real e visceral.  Treine sua mira e reflexos, viva um verdadeiro apocalipse zumbi pela primeira vez!

Curta nossa página no Facebook e seja tester do game =)

 
O player literalmente gira 360 para olhar ao redor da cidade
 
Sinta o Medo em Primeira-Mão
 
Você pode se mover fisicamente pra se desviar de mordidas: o jogo detecta sua aceleração linear pelo fluxo ótico da câmera. Dê alguns passos no mundo real para andar no mundo do jogo, nenhum joystick é necessário (só opcional). Não entre em pânico, desvie das criaturas e mate-as, explore salas pequenas e escuras, colete itens ensanguentados, resolva puzzles mortais. Você adentra no novo mundo do jogo como um pesadelo – uma imersão incrível em um VR zombie game muito a frente do seu tempo.  Sinta na pele a adrenalina!
Além disso, o game implementa uma tecnologia inovadora de otimização para gerar gráficos ultra-realistas (inspirados em Call of Duty MW) mesmo hardwares móveis limitados.
Sombras no chão te avisam quando um zumbi está se aproximando atrás do seu pescoço. Usando fones de ouvido, você pode ouvir gritos e passos ensandecidos vindos da esquerda ou direita e girar rapidamente atirando. Use seus sentidos para sobreviver como nunca antes em um game.  
Realismo, controles, sons, ambientação, todos os elementos de game design estão lá para você finalmente saber como você se sentiria em uma experiência de estar cercado por mortos vivos e lutar pela sua sobrevivência.
Gráficos ultra-realistas em hardware mobile. 
 
Nós Amamos Imersão de Verdade.
Nós amamos a imersão oferecida por controles de movimento, desde as pistolas laser dos árcades até tablets, Wii e Kinect. Nesse sentido, You Are Surrounded permite você progredir ativamente em uma habilidade relevante de tiro como um esporte físico. A sensação de realidade virtual é como um óculos head-tracking futurista, porém imediatamente acessível.

<div><br/></div>
<h3>Swords are Cool</h3>
<p>And knowing how they work is even cooler.</p>
<p>And blasting past 200% of our funding goal is coolest of all. Thank you!!</p>
<p><b>Newsflash</b>: We have our Liechtenauer funding! </p>
<p><b>Newsflash:</b> Our Patron has spoken: his deck will be based on him personally, in the guise of a Teutonic Knight. This means of course that the Patron deck, probably named ""Nicodemus Kariensis"", will be a highly-trained <i>Liechtenauer style swordsman.</i> This will be compatible to fight with the other decks, with or without the Liechtenauer expansion pack. But if you want to beat him at his own style, you will need the Liechtenauer expansion!</p>
<h3>About the Game</h3>
<p>This game idea was born when Rami and Guy were discussing how hard it is for students to learn swordsmanship terminology and theory. So we thought about flash cards, and suddenly it came to us- a card game that is fun to play, and at the same time imparts real knowledge of our martial heritage.</p>
<p>So we talked to some game designers, raised some funds, and hired Games and Tales in Oulu, Finland, to come up with a prototype. The game is done, playable, ready.</p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of our Patrons, we have raised thefunds to complete the artwork and print up the first run of cards. Not just the two original decks, but four character decks and the armour expansion. Now we are working towards expanding the game to include medieval German techniques. That's where you come in: please help us reach our new stretch goal of 50,000€!</p>
<h3>The Team:</h3>
<p>Samuli, the game designer. He makes it fun to play.</p>
<p>Guy, the swordsmanship instructor. He makes it as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>Jussi: the Artist. He makes it beautiful.</p>
<p>Rami, the director: he keeps the artists (Guy, Jussi and Samuli) in check, and makes sure we won't go bankrupt or get arrested.</p>
<p>Your money is safe with us: Guy has done two campaigns before: <a href=""http://igg.me/p/36662/x/210782"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Syllabus Video campaign"">Swordschool Syllabus Video</a>, which raised money to create <a href=""http://www.swordschool.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Syllabus video wiki"">a free online swordsmanship video archive</a>, and <a href=""http://igg.me/p/77777/x/210782"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Vadi campaign"">Veni VADI Vici</a>, which raised money for Guy to translate and publish a medieval Italian combat manual. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Veni-Vadi-Vici-Guy-Windsor/dp/9529316860"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Veni Vadi Vici"">You can buy the book here</a>! So when we raise the funds, the game WILL be made.</p>
<h3>Why Buy Now?</h3>
<p>Why not wait until the game is in the shops? Firstly, <b>we will include a limited edition card for all subscribers who buy at least one deck of cards</b>. This card will be playable in the game, or can be collected, as you like. The total print run will be determined by the number of copies of the game we sell during the campaign. Collectors please note, we also have a much more limited-run card (100 copies total) with some of our perks at 100€ and over. </p>
<p>Secondly, we may not release it through normal channels: it all depends on how many we end up selling here. The more sales we make now, the more likely it is that the appeal is broad enough to warrant normal distribution channels.</p>
<p>Please note that <b>all perks at 10€ and above include the basic game pdf,</b> so even if you can only afford a single printed deck, you can print out the other and play with your friends.</p>
<p>Update: <span>We have decided to add a PDF copy of the second edition of Guy's book, <em>The Swordsman's Companion</em>, to all perk levels at 10</span><span>€ and above. This will be retroactive, of course, so if you have already backed us, you will be getting this too.

<h3>The Game:</h3>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/933832/pictures/full/20130717035236-pommel_2.jpg?1374058357"" src="""" style="""" title=""pommel to the face!""/></p>

<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>In August 1395, two of the finest knights in the world met in single combat.  A couple of months earlier, Jean le Maingre, known as <strong>Boucicault</strong>, had made disparaging remarks about the valour of Italian knights. <strong>Galeazzo</strong> da Mantoa heard him and demanded satisfaction. Finally, they met on the field of honour. Galeazzo was slow to mount his horse, so Boucicault got impatient, jumped off his, and ran at Galeazzo with a spear. Galeazzo beat his spear aside and smacked Boucicault upside the head.</p>
<p>Perhaps Galeazzo’s training with legendary Master of the Art of Arms, Fiore dei Liberi, had something to do with his success?</p>
<p>That master, Fiore dei Liberi, wrote a comprehensive manual of his techniques, which Guy has been studying since 1994. This sophisticated combat system is now sufficiently well understood that it has provided the mechanics for this game. </p>
<p>The game was born when, after a swordsmanship class one evening in October 2012, Rami and Guy were talking about how hard it is for some swordsmanship students to remember the basic terminology and theory of the Art of Arms. Sure, it doesn’t help that it’s all in Italian. Medieval Italian. With funny spelling.</p>
<p>Rami suggested flashcards. Guy then thought of the enemy recognition cards used by the Armed Forces. In WWII it was German planes and ships; in Afghanistan these days it’s pictures of wanted terrorists. So while G.I.Joe is playing poker, he is constantly being reminded of what the enemy looks like. So why not make swordsmanship playing cards?</p>
<p>Then Rami said: why not a game?</p>
<p>And a student passing by chipped in: “I’d buy it”.</p>
<p>So Rami went to his business college and secured some funding, which we used to hire Samuli and Jussi; we started a company; and here we are: On the point of launching the first ever card game based entirely on authentic, historical swordsmanship.</p>
<p>This game is the most accurate possible representation of Fiore dei Liberi’s swordsmanship style.  Play the game and you will learn the terminology, tactics and techniques that Fiore describes in his monumental book, The Flower of Battle.</p>
<p>You can see video samples of gameplay in our Gallery.</p>

</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We now have enough money to make the game, two extra decks, and our first expansion pack. Huzzah! We are now raising the funds to make a second expansion pack, which will add German medieval combat skills to the characters. We need money for the game designer (genius is not cheap), the artist (also a genius, and so not cheap) printing and packaging (which we could do on the cheap but will not: art of this quality deserves the best physical form we can get), and shipping. Please help!</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>We have made it to our first two stretch goals: a female deck, and the armour expansion pack, thanks to our kind and excellent patrons!</p>
<p>The Lady deck will probably be one of these amazing combatants:</p>
<p>- <strong>Joanna of Flanders</strong>, “Jeanne la Flamme”, who in the siege of Henneport in 1342 “took up arms and, dressed in armour, conducted the defence of the town”.<br/>- <strong>Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine</strong>, who led an army to rescue her husband in 1436.<br/>- <strong>Lady Agnes Randolph</strong>, “Black Agnes”, who defended her castle at Dunbar against a siege for 5 months.<br/>-<strong> Agnes Hotot</strong>, of the House Dudley, who fought a duel in her father’s stead and (legend has it) following it stripped her breastplate to prove to the offender he’d been bested by a woman. This last is obviously impossible, as anyone who has ever worn armour knows!</p>
<p>Let us know which one you favour! We have <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14-Vfj3e6VAAjaWId_TXi4RT0ZAjkJuDvwDyoxA7_kxw/viewform"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a poll running here</a>, where you can let us know what you think, or make your own suggestions.</p>
<p>The Armour expansion pack:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The armour expansion will be between 18 and 24 cards, which will include armour, and the techniques that work agains it. So with one copy, you can destroy your unarmoured opponent, or divide the armour and the techniques that work against it with your opponent. But best of all of course, and essential for a formal duel, is if you have a copy each.</p>
<p><b>If we make it to 50,000€, we will produce a second expansion: LIECHTENAUER </b>(the dominant German system of Longsword). So all characters can add the guards, techniques, and tactics of this system to their repertoire.<br/></p>
<p><b>If we get to 60,000€ we will produce a third expansion pack: AXES AND SPEARS! </b>When Galeazzo and Boucicault actually fought, they did so with spears. Fiore provides us with instruction for the spear, and also the pollax, so if we reach our 60k stretch goal, we will make an expansion pack that allows players to add these fantastic weapons to their arsenal. This will include the possibility of fighting with the sword against axe or spear; the spear against axe or sword, and the axe against spear or sword, as well as the more usual matched weapons setup. If possible, we will include daggers as a back-up weapon for close quarters work, but that will depend on game design issues that are not yet resolved.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This game provides entertainment, of course. But it is firmly based on the system of knightly combat written down in 1410 by Fiore dei Liberi. So you will also learn something about our European martial heritage, and be supporting our work to research the lost martial arts of Europe. We know we have done our job right if by playing this game, anyone who then comes to a Fiore beginner's course will find that they are familiar with the terminology and basic structure of the system.</p>
<p>The game will also be useful to those already training in swordsmanship, as a teaching tool. It can, for instance, be used to make freeplay more interesting: pick a guard card and fight from there, or pick a technique card and that's the only action you can win with. </p>
<p>The game can also work for LARPers, as a set of combat mechanics to simulate fights between players.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you think this is a cool idea, please share it with your friends. If you can't afford the game right now, persuade your friends to get one!</p>

The campaign is over, and we have sent out the first two decks (Jean le Maingre and Galeazzo da Mantoa), the Indiegogo special card, the Limited Edition card, the Lady deck, and the Armour Expansion. The Patron deck and Liechtenauer Expansion pack are ready as Print and Play decks, and have been sent to the printers: we expect the proofs to arrive in January 2016, and if all goes well, they should ship that month.
WE ARE DONE! Sorry it took so long!

Hello everyone, my name is Jamie Vanderhoef, and I'm the developer of
Siege of Turtle Enclave. I've been developing the game for about a
year and a half, and it has at last arrived at the home stretch. The
journey to this point has been magical, and the support from fans has
been humbling. I thank you all for what you have done for the project
and for me personally as a result. Though I have endeavored
to provide the most polished and appealing experience possible, I am
only one person, and as the end comes more clearly into view I
realize that there is much that remains beyond my power in order to
make the game into the gem that I know it can be. That is why I am
appealing to you today.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/150396/files/20131023112601-DetailsDecal.png?1382552761"" src="""" style=""width: 572.9100000000001px; height: 113px;""/></p>

<p>
Siege of Turtle Enclave is a turn based strategy war game with real
time battles, it's set in a vibrant and inviting fantasy world where
the last remnant of a nation of turtles valiantly makes a stand
against the ravaging hordes of corrupt owls which have wrested away
most of the turtle's homeland. Over the course of the game players
will research technologies, build up their settlement, train armies,
and fight their way across the map in an attempt to overthrow the
enemy warlord in his keep. Along the way, players will find goodie
huts, collect resources from the map, and discover and recruit
powerful heroes to fight alongside their armies. Each play through
will be different, as the campaign map is randomly generated at the
start of each new game, adding to the game's replay value.</p>
<p>
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
Battles are fought between armies consisting of up to 12 units each, with each side deploying up to 6 units onto the field and the remainder kept in reserve to replace fallen or wounded units as the battle proceeds.
Each unit has a Damage Type and an Alignment, these two factors
combine to determine how much damage deals to another unit in a kind
of 'dual-rock-paper-scissors' system, countering Damage Types
increases damage, whereas countering Alignment types reduce incoming
damage. Units will also gain levels as they fight, increasing their
HP, Attack, Defense, and Stamina. Stamina is used for special
abilities, unlocked when a unit reaches lvl 3 and some units get a
second one at level 6, and it's also used for attacking/defending, running out of
Stamina will result in de-buffs and reduced combat efficiency. <u><b>These features have been implemented into the current build of the game.</b></u></p>

<p></p>
<p>
Players move armies around the map in traditional turn based fashion,
with battles ensuing when two armies sharing the same tile decide to
engage one another. The enemy corrupts the tiles it occupies, and
players must move their armies onto the corrupt tiles to purify them
so resources can be collected from them. Hidden throughout the map
are Goodie Huts, which can offer the player new techs, crops, units,
or even Heroes! Enemy armies will spawn from Barracks and Towers
hidden throughout the map, and taking these out will reduce their
ability to fight against you as you build up enough strength to
attack the enemy capital, which is somewhere on the opposite side of
the map. <u><b>These features have been implemented into the current
build of the game.</b></u></p>

<p></p>
<p>
The player's settlement is the heart of their empire, it's where all
troops are trained and all buildings are built, losing it means game
over. Each turn represents one day of game time, how much a player
can do each day is determined by how many workers they have stationed
in the Enclave contributing 'hours' of work, these hours are used to
build new buildings and harvest resources, as well as to construct
improvements on the world map such as roads or citadels. Time as a
dynamic resource adds a bit of spice in comparison to the standard
turn-based interpretation of time; i.e. wait X amount of turns for Y
to be finished. <u><b>These features have been implemented into the
current build of the game.</b></u></p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
Within the Enclave, players will be able to forage for and cultivate
powerful crops which can be assigned to armies to give them buffs or
single-use-per-battle advantages. Other crops may provide a slow but
steady stream of resources, or other non-battle buffs. <u style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>This feature is planned for implementation before release, but
a rough iteration of it exists in the current build of the game.</b></u></p>

Players can discover, learn, and cast powerful spells with the use of
a Sorcerer's Tower at the cost of Magic Crystals, this is how the
system works now, though I have plans to implement a more robust and
exciting system utilizing mana, charges, towers, and area-of-effect
spells, for example: one might have a Sorcerer's Tower built in the
Enclave, but it's range won't be able cast spells across the map, for
this the player will have to build 'relay towers' to channel the
spell, and these towers may have spells cast on them to effect any
units or tiles within their range, like a thick fog to restrict the
movement of enemy armies. The enemy will also be given such tools to
use against the player, bringing into play the need for magical
'defenses' to hinder or stop such evils from blighting your lands or
soldiers. <u><b>This feature is planned for implementation before
release, but a </b></u><i><u><b>very</b></u></i><u><b> rough
iteration of it exists in the current build of the game.</b></u></p>

<p>
Besides the main Campaign, I am planning on adding two other game
modes, Skirmish, and Conquest Mode, both of these modes focus on the
real time battles. Skirmish mode is a simple set piece battle, fought
with either random or selected units, with limited or unlimited
resources to build both armies, this could be thought of as a testing
ground for new battle strategies or just a bit of fun checking out
units you might not normally use or see in-game. Conquest Mode is a
progressive series of procedurally generated battles. At the start of
the game players will select their units, paying for upgrades or
levels, and select a Hero to lead their army, then the army they have
built will fight an enemy army. If the player wins the they will
receive money and experience to put towards more upgrades, replacing
fallen units, or purchasing different ones, then they fight another
battle, a little harder than the previous one. This goes on until the
player dies/runs out of money, so it's an endless survival mode
filled with nothing but battles. I hope to allow players to command either turtles or owls in both Skirmish and Conquest mode. <u><b>These
features are planned for implementation before release with </b></u><i><u><b>no</b></u></i><u><b>
iteration of them in the current build of the game.</b></u></p>

The planned additions and revisions I can do with nothing but time
and effort. What I cannot do at all is compose an original
soundtrack, generate clean, atmospheric, and professional sound
effects, nor am I much of a pixel artist.
These elements of polish require the expertise of others. So if the
campaign here is successful with the help of loyal fans such as
yourself, I shall procure the services of said experts to raise the
quality of the game to match it's potential, further improving the UI, sound, and music. The funding will also
permit me to put more time into developing the game, freeing me to
add a level of design and feature polish that would otherwise be
outside the realm of practicality, and some of the planned features
may not be able to reach their full potential if certain goals are
not met. Of course I realize that many of you may not be able (or
willing) to offer the project material resources, but if you really
like what you see and want to help somehow, <i><u><b>spread the word,</b></u></i>
this actually can help just as much or more than contributing to the
campaign. If you tell even as few as 8 people about the game, if one
of them contributes then in essence you just supported the campaign
without any cost to yourself! (And potentially made another gamer
very happy by leading them to this game).</p>

<p></p>
<p></p></span></span></div>","Hello everyone, my name is Jamie Vanderhoef, and I'm the developer of
Siege of Turtle Enclave. I've been developing the game for about a
year and a half, and it has at last arrived at the home stretch. The
journey to this point has been magical, and the support from fans has
been humbling. I thank you all for what you have done for the project
and for me personally as a result. Though I have endeavored
to provide the most polished and appealing experience possible, I am
only one person, and as the end comes more clearly into view I
realize that there is much that remains beyond my power in order to
make the game into the gem that I know it can be. That is why I am
appealing to you today.








Siege of Turtle Enclave is a turn based strategy war game with real
time battles, it's set in a vibrant and inviting fantasy world where
the last remnant of a nation of turtles valiantly makes a stand
against the ravaging hordes of corrupt owls which have wrested away
most of the turtle's homeland. Over the course of the game players
will research technologies, build up their settlement, train armies,
and fight their way across the map in an attempt to overthrow the
enemy warlord in his keep. Along the way, players will find goodie
huts, collect resources from the map, and discover and recruit
powerful heroes to fight alongside their armies. Each play through
will be different, as the campaign map is randomly generated at the
start of each new game, adding to the game's replay value.



                     


Battles are fought between armies consisting of up to 12 units each, with each side deploying up to 6 units onto the field and the remainder kept in reserve to replace fallen or wounded units as the battle proceeds.
Each unit has a Damage Type and an Alignment, these two factors
combine to determine how much damage deals to another unit in a kind
of 'dual-rock-paper-scissors' system, countering Damage Types
increases damage, whereas countering Alignment types reduce incoming
damage. Units will also gain levels as they fight, increasing their
HP, Attack, Defense, and Stamina. Stamina is used for special
abilities, unlocked when a unit reaches lvl 3 and some units get a
second one at level 6, and it's also used for attacking/defending, running out of
Stamina will result in de-buffs and reduced combat efficiency. These features have been implemented into the current build of the game.



                     


Players move armies around the map in traditional turn based fashion,
with battles ensuing when two armies sharing the same tile decide to
engage one another. The enemy corrupts the tiles it occupies, and
players must move their armies onto the corrupt tiles to purify them
so resources can be collected from them. Hidden throughout the map
are Goodie Huts, which can offer the player new techs, crops, units,
or even Heroes! Enemy armies will spawn from Barracks and Towers
hidden throughout the map, and taking these out will reduce their
ability to fight against you as you build up enough strength to
attack the enemy capital, which is somewhere on the opposite side of
the map. These features have been implemented into the current
build of the game.



                     


The player's settlement is the heart of their empire, it's where all
troops are trained and all buildings are built, losing it means game
over. Each turn represents one day of game time, how much a player
can do each day is determined by how many workers they have stationed
in the Enclave contributing 'hours' of work, these hours are used to
build new buildings and harvest resources, as well as to construct
improvements on the world map such as roads or citadels. Time as a
dynamic resource adds a bit of spice in comparison to the standard
turn-based interpretation of time; i.e. wait X amount of turns for Y
to be finished. These features have been implemented into the
current build of the game.



                     


Within the Enclave, players will be able to forage for and cultivate
powerful crops which can be assigned to armies to give them buffs or
single-use-per-battle advantages. Other crops may provide a slow but
steady stream of resources, or other non-battle buffs. This feature is planned for implementation before release, but
a rough iteration of it exists in the current build of the game.



                     


Players can discover, learn, and cast powerful spells with the use of
a Sorcerer's Tower at the cost of Magic Crystals, this is how the
system works now, though I have plans to implement a more robust and
exciting system utilizing mana, charges, towers, and area-of-effect

spell, and these towers may have spells cast on them to effect any
units or tiles within their range, like a thick fog to restrict the
movement of enemy armies. The enemy will also be given such tools to
use against the player, bringing into play the need for magical
'defenses' to hinder or stop such evils from blighting your lands or
soldiers. This feature is planned for implementation before
release, but a very rough
iteration of it exists in the current build of the game.



                     


Besides the main Campaign, I am planning on adding two other game
modes, Skirmish, and Conquest Mode, both of these modes focus on the
real time battles. Skirmish mode is a simple set piece battle, fought
with either random or selected units, with limited or unlimited
resources to build both armies, this could be thought of as a testing
ground for new battle strategies or just a bit of fun checking out
units you might not normally use or see in-game. Conquest Mode is a
progressive series of procedurally generated battles. At the start of
the game players will select their units, paying for upgrades or
levels, and select a Hero to lead their army, then the army they have
built will fight an enemy army. If the player wins the they will
receive money and experience to put towards more upgrades, replacing
fallen units, or purchasing different ones, then they fight another
battle, a little harder than the previous one. This goes on until the
player dies/runs out of money, so it's an endless survival mode
filled with nothing but battles. I hope to allow players to command either turtles or owls in both Skirmish and Conquest mode. These
features are planned for implementation before release with no
iteration of them in the current build of the game.

<p>Monster Trainer is the world's very first real world MMORPG. Monster Trainer9* is set in a real world identical to our own (meaning players can navigate large, open representations of actual cities all around the world (like London, England..New York, New York…Paris, France…Ha Noi, Vietnam or Pompeii, Italy……the list goes on and on).</p>
<p>The game functions in real time, meaning when the time is 1:30 PM in the ""real"" New York City, the time in the game's New York City will also be 1:30 PM. We take this real-time aspect to the extreme by extending it things like weather and seasons, construction, natural disasters and all sorts of other real-world events.</p>
<p>Let me put this in to perspective for you. As of today the United State's government is not functioning as it usually has been. These events would drastically effect things in the Monster Trainer world.

<p>Another example is animal migrations. A yearly occurrence in (for example) California between October and February is the migration of butterflies (traveling up to 2,000 miles). The Monster Trainer world would reflect these real-world happenings, making butterfly creatures available for battle and capture during this time.</p>
<p>These types of events would be occurring almost daily, making Monster Trainer incredibly unique and offering players an ever-changing environment to play in and learn from.</p>
<p>Like other RPGs, each city will have it's own collection of unique monsters, quests, items and just the culture in general. There's no limit to the potential of this real-world aspect.</p>
<p>Monster Trainer allows for a great deal of customization, allowing players to create a an in-game character that represents exactly who you are or somebody completely different. The customization extends far past the look of the player as we've introduced a very unique and in-depth skill system that allows trainers to develop certain abilities to gain advantages over other players in various areas, which could even allow players to barter their skills/service in-game.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Those that contribute by backing the project will have beta access to the game, working directly with our developers and designers and getting a sneak peak at the game before anyone else.</p>
<p>We're creating a very strong and involved community where each member can contribute their thoughts and opinions to the development process by suggesting ideas and having open discussions about how certain features could effect and better the gameplay. You can see this in action right now in the Monster Trainer forums.</p>

What happens when we reach our goal?
Upon successfully completing the Monster Trainer Indiegogo campaign we'll begin hiring on essential team members (a more skilled developer to complete our prototype, a marketer to handle product launch/planning and bring our incredibly talented artists on as paid staff members.
Following a short period of development, the game will open for first private, then public beta (on the web browser, mobile phones, tablets and supported console browsers!).



Hi, everyone! I'm Nick McMillen and I'm working on Monster Trainer, an in-development browser-based monster training MMORPG project.
I'm super excited to talk to all of you about what we've been working on and what we hope you can be a part of.


Monster Trainer is an open-world monster capturing, trading and battling multiplayer online role-playing game where players navigate large, open landscapes inhabited by dangerous creatures. Trainers battle, capture and tame these monsters to compete with other trainers in battle or use their monster's skills for other in-game activities (like gather materials and racing). Monster Trainer will feature countless ""mini games"" to ensure that there's always something new and exciting to do.

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I get a LIT activity tracker?</strong><br/> A: LIT is currently only available through Indiegogo. Support the campaign and reserve your own LIT today. Be the first of your friends to experience LIT.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When does LIT begin shipping?</strong><br/> A: LIT begins shipping in August 2013, hurry up and reserve LIT today so you can get yours first.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What activities does LIT track?</strong><br/>A: LIT has been specifically designed to recognize the movements in action sports and applies tailored algorithms to score those movements. LIT also tracks day-to-day activities like walking and running (i.e. steps). See the specification section above for a partial list of metrics provided for select activity types.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I have to be a pro athlete to use LIT?</strong><br/> A: No. LIT allows you to set up casual competitions with your friends through the mobile App. You can also share your activities online, so that while other people may be saying they're riding, shredding or boarding, you have the stats to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What smartphone does the LIT app work with?</strong><br/> A: Right now, the LIT App works with any iOS device that uses Bluetooth 4.0. That includes iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, the latest iPads and iPod Touches (version 6.0 or higher). The LIT app will be available for Android in January 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will Android be available?</strong><br/>A: Android is a major priority for us. We'll for sure have it by January 2014, possibly sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does LIT track heart rate?</strong><br/> A: No. The LIT module does not include sensors for heart rate. However, we do anticipate adding the feature to import heart rate data from other heart rate monitors that use Bluetooth 4.0 in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does LIT function as a regular watch/pedometer/etc? Is the idea to make this something people rock full time or just when they're shredding?</strong><br/>A: Yes, LIT displays time. LIT is an activity tracker designed to be worn 24x7, no matter the occasion and in its simplest form, LIT functions as a normal watch and pedometer. In the design process we took all of the popular features of activity trackers and just added to them. We really hope that people will love LIT the way we do and rock it all day. Our team certainly does.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does LIT track sleep?</strong><br/> A: Not at this time. LIT interprets inactivity (including sleep) as inactivity. We do not analyze periods of inactivity to detect specific sleep patterns or sleep metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does LIT count calories?</strong><br/> A: No. We count fun. In all seriousness, calories are too difficult to calculate accurately, so out of principle, we do not include it. In our opinion, most of the other products that do display calories are making a guess, and that is not good enough for us. Daily scores and duration of activity are more reflective of day to day exertion.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will there be a desktop or web app available?</strong><br/> A: For now, we are focused on the mobile (and tablet) experience. LIT syncs wirelessly with your phone, and the richest experience occurs through the phone/tablet.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I wear LIT while swimming or surfing?</strong><br/> A: For sure! LIT goes where you go. It is modular, rugged, and water resistant to 100 meters (that's more than 300 feet).</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are you supposed to wear LIT all day?</strong><br/> A: Yes. LIT tracks your activities 24x7 and can be worn in several ways. We have accessories that can put LIT on your wrist, hip, pocket or hanging on a lanyard. Keeping it on all day will help you track your active lifestyle with no interruptions or excuses.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long does the LIT tracker's battery last?</strong><br/>A: The LIT battery lasts up to four days on a single charge. We're working on extending battery life, so that you rarely have to stop to charge up.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you sync LIT with your phone?</strong><br/> A: LIT syncs with your smart device wirelessly, through Bluetooth LE. Swipe to sync and just watch your scores roll in.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does LIT improve my abilities at all?</strong><br/> A: It's really cool, but it's not magic. LIT can help your training, but won't improve your abilities directly. With LIT you'll be able to monitor exactly how high, long and hard you're hitting your active lifestyle on a daily basis. LIT also gets you to a new level of competition - including one-on-one challenges, live leaderboards, king of the mountain, impromptu competitions and more.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What data is available straight from the device?</strong><br/> A: The LIT device displays time, cumulative score, steps, and battery life. The free downloadable app will offer a majority of the information. It's designed this way to optimize the battery life of the module. LIT can be worn for more than four days without a recharge. The app will provide details on your day-to-day activities as well as specific details about the action sports you participate in. See specifications above for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does LIT track speed and altitude?</strong><br/>A: The LIT app imports GPS information from your smartphone. As such, LIT will capture speed, distance, elevation, vertical, etc. for activities where you have your phone with you while participating. The LIT module itself does not have a GPS sensor.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the difference between LIT and other activity monitors?</strong><br/>A: LIT contains many of the awesome features of existing activity trackers. Our design intent was to take the best features and add to them by accounting for the dynamics of action sports. So, in addition to counting steps, we count jumps, rotations, airtime and lots more.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does it mean to track airtime?</strong><br/>A: There are potentially lots of false positives when it comes to airtime, especially when you wear the device on your wrist. But, for those of you who have gotten some air (hopefully everyone reading this), you definitely know the feeling and so do we. It's addicting and super fun, and we capture that in all it's glory.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does it mean to track turns?</strong><br/>A: Whether moving around the office, the house, driving around in the car, etc, you make lots of turns throughout the day. We don't track those turns, we're talking about the big ones, the ones you feel in your thighs.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can LIT track flips?</strong><br/>A: Oh yea... We have been working pretty hard on getting that in there, and our accuracy is almost there. Anyone want to test for us? And we're not talking about on a trampoline.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does your technology work?</strong><br/>A: It's a secret! But, we'll say that a big part of it is recording crazy data from multiple complementary sensors and turning it in to rotation matrices and 3D vectors, much like computer game developers use to render 3D graphics. It's cool technology and we're lucky it works so well with action sports.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does it mean to track paddles?</strong><br/>A: It's a lot like being able to track a swim stroke. Almost identical in fact, and yeah, we track swim strokes too, but we're all about action sports. So train in the pool to live in the ocean...</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you add more metrics?</strong><br/>A: Yes, for sure. It takes a lot of testing, and we want to make sure we achieve an acceptable quality level and accuracy, but the good news is that we love testing.</p>

FAQ
Q: Where can I get a LIT activity tracker? A: LIT is currently only available through Indiegogo. Support the campaign and reserve your own LIT today. Be the first of your friends to experience LIT.
Q: When does LIT begin shipping? A: LIT begins shipping in August 2013, hurry up and reserve LIT today so you can get yours first.
Q: What activities does LIT track?A: LIT has been specifically designed to recognize the movements in action sports and applies tailored algorithms to score those movements. LIT also tracks day-to-day activities like walking and running (i.e. steps). See the specification section above for a partial list of metrics provided for select activity types.
Q: Do I have to be a pro athlete to use LIT? A: No. LIT allows you to set up casual competitions with your friends through the mobile App. You can also share your activities online, so that while other people may be saying they're riding, shredding or boarding, you have the stats to prove it.
Q: What smartphone does the LIT app work with? A: Right now, the LIT App works with any iOS device that uses Bluetooth 4.0. That includes iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, the latest iPads and iPod Touches (version 6.0 or higher). The LIT app will be available for Android in January 2014.
Q: When will Android be available?A: Android is a major priority for us. We'll for sure have it by January 2014, possibly sooner.
Q: Does LIT track heart rate? A: No. The LIT module does not include sensors for heart rate. However, we do anticipate adding the feature to import heart rate data from other heart rate monitors that use Bluetooth 4.0 in 2014.
Q: Does LIT function as a regular watch/pedometer/etc? Is the idea to make this something people rock full time or just when they're shredding?A: Yes, LIT displays time. LIT is an activity tracker designed to be worn 24x7, no matter the occasion and in its simplest form, LIT functions as a normal watch and pedometer. In the design process we took all of the popular features of activity trackers and just added to them. We really hope that people will love LIT the way we do and rock it all day. Our team certainly does.
Q: Does LIT track sleep? A: Not at this time. LIT interprets inactivity (including sleep) as inactivity. We do not analyze periods of inactivity to detect specific sleep patterns or sleep metrics.
Q: Does LIT count calories? A: No. We count fun. In all seriousness, calories are too difficult to calculate accurately, so out of principle, we do not include it. In our opinion, most of the other products that do display calories are making a guess, and that is not good enough for us. Daily scores and duration of activity are more reflective of day to day exertion.
Q: Will there be a desktop or web app available? A: For now, we are focused on the mobile (and tablet) experience. LIT syncs wirelessly with your phone, and the richest experience occurs through the phone/tablet.
Q: Can I wear LIT while swimming or surfing? A: For sure! LIT goes where you go. It is modular, rugged, and water resistant to 100 meters (that's more than 300 feet).
Q: Are you supposed to wear LIT all day? A: Yes. LIT tracks your activities 24x7 and can be worn in several ways. We have accessories that can put LIT on your wrist, hip, pocket or hanging on a lanyard. Keeping it on all day will help you track your active lifestyle with no interruptions or excuses.
Q: How long does the LIT tracker's battery last?A: The LIT battery lasts up to four days on a single charge. We're working on extending battery life, so that you rarely have to stop to charge up.
Q: How do you sync LIT with your phone? A: LIT syncs with your smart device wirelessly, through Bluetooth LE. Swipe to sync and just watch your scores roll in.
Q: Does LIT improve my abilities at all? A: It's really cool, but it's not magic. LIT can help your training, but won't improve your abilities directly. With LIT you'll be able to monitor exactly how high, long and hard you're hitting your active lifestyle on a daily basis. LIT also gets you to a new level of competition - including one-on-one challenges, live leaderboards, king of the mountain, impromptu competitions and more.
Q: What data is available straight from the device? A: The LIT device displays time, cumulative score, steps, and battery life. The free downloadable app will offer a majority of the information. It's designed this way to optimize the battery life of the module. LIT can be worn for more than four days without a recharge. The app will provide details on your day-to-day activities as well as specific details about the action sports you participate in. See specifications above for more details.
Q: Does LIT track speed and altitude?A: The LIT app imports GPS information from your smartphone. As such, LIT will capture speed, distance, elevation, vertical, etc. for activities where you have your phone with you while participating. The LIT module itself does not have a GPS sensor.
Q: What is the difference between LIT and other activity monitors?A: LIT contains many of the awesome features of existing activity trackers. Our design intent was to take the best features and add to them by accounting for the dynamics of action sports. So, in addition to counting steps, we count jumps, rotations, airtime and lots more.
Q: What does it mean to track airtime?A: There are potentially lots of false positives when it comes to airtime, especially when you wear the device on your wrist. But, for those of you who have gotten some air (hopefully everyone reading this), you definitely know the feeling and so do we. It's addicting and super fun, and we capture that in all it's glory.
Q: What does it mean to track turns?A: Whether moving around the office, the house, driving around in the car, etc, you make lots of turns throughout the day. We don't track those turns, we're talking about the big ones, the ones you feel in your thighs.
Q: Can LIT track flips?A: Oh yea... We have been working pretty hard on getting that in there, and our accuracy is almost there. Anyone want to test for us? And we're not talking about on a trampoline.
Q: How does your technology work?A: It's a secret! But, we'll say that a big part of it is recording crazy data from multiple complementary sensors and turning it in to rotation matrices and 3D vectors, much like computer game developers use to render 3D graphics. It's cool technology and we're lucky it works so well with action sports.
Q: What does it mean to track paddles?A: It's a lot like being able to track a swim stroke. Almost identical in fact, and yeah, we track swim strokes too, but we're all about action sports. So train in the pool to live in the ocean...
Q: Will you add more metrics?A: Yes, for sure. It takes a lot of testing, and we want to make sure we achieve an acceptable quality level and accuracy, but the good news is that we love testing.

<p>NeuroMash, is a “mind-control” casino gaming company utilizing newly available third-party mobile, inexpensive EEG-reading headsets for casino games. This headset, developed by NeuroSky, utilizes raw brainwave signals to control the game’s interaction. We chose <em>NeuroMash</em> as our company name because we wanted to “mash-up” classical gaming with this unique and novel form of user interaction. We believe our new “mind-control” casino gaming will offer a ""disruptive"" level of user interaction right along with currently available traditional casino gaming. Just imagine using a ""mind trick” to beat the house in slots. Mind-control casino gaming will offer gamers what they have always wanted, the power to self influence their odds of winning. Nothing captures the imagination like the power of the mind and playing our “mind games” in multiplayer environments, such as our upcoming “Neuropoker” game, will teach you how to hone your real-world poker skills and become a better competitor. Please<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> join us at this critical moment in time for mind-control gaming and “cross the chasm” with us!</span></p>

<p>We are currently at the beginning of the mind game evolution. This is a unique moment to join a brand new industry by helping us put this genre of technology on the gaming map!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First, we must work towards the Beta Release of NeuroSlot and our single line of casino games. The beta release will be built through a cross platform strategy using Unity 4.2 and will interface with Neurosky’s MindWave and MindWave Mobile hardware. These will be released on Android, iOS, PC and Mac. For instance, you could view a detailed video description of our prototype for Neuroslot in the gallery section of this campaign. Upon the successful Beta completion, we plan on publishing “Neuroslot” (Slots mind game) followed by “Neurowar” (Casino Wars mind game), “Neurojack” (Blackjack mind game) and “Neuroulette” (Roulette mind game) on Neurosky’s gaming portal. </p></span><p></p>

<p></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><br/></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Furthermore, each headset comes with several unique algorithms developed by NeuroSky including concentration, relaxation, blinks, task difficulty. and task familiarity activities. To that effect, along with our single player line of casino mind games, we are currently working on an interactive multi-player poker mind game. Just imagine playing Texas Hold ‘Em and although your opponents can’t see your cards, they can see your various biosignals. Yes, we are giving the online Poker enthusiasts what the “live players” have always had. “Tells!” For the first time ever, online poker players will have tells on their opponents. For instance, your opponents will be able to see both your own and your competitor’s level of relaxation and focus during the game.  In the process, you will learn to make better gambling decisions and become better online poker players. Neuropoker can become a valuable “learning tool” for live players! Live players can monitor their online playing activity while playing Neuropoker and learn how to control their real-world poker skills and become a better competitor. Please note that Neuropoker will be a web-based only game and will be offered on Neuromash.com in a multi-player environment.</p>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are on Indiegogo because we know that this is the best way to get our “mind-control” casino games in your hands as soon as possible! With all of the above in mind, we estimate we will need $25,000 for the launch of our initial single player casino mind games and initial development of Neuropoker and other upcoming multi-player mind-control casino games. Join us in creating this new genre of casino games and let’s share our novel vision with the world!</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The core Neuromash team includes Mehran, Daniel and Kevin. Our passion is cutting edge technology and we aim to integrate technology into our everyday activities in a natural and fitting way. Mehran and Kevin are life long friends working in the tech and business sector.They came across thought-controlled computer interface technology back in the fall of 2010 and eventually became infatuated by it. Dan joined the group in the following summer of 2011 right out of college with a fresh degree in computer science and somewhere along the way we combined our backgrounds in computer science and entrepreneurship to create Neuromash. We believe that “mind-control” gaming is in its infancy and will only make every day life more interactive and entertaining. That is why we are asking for your support. We are eager to listen to your feedback once you receive and play our single player casino mind games. If you believe in our futuristic vision of casino gaming, our passion, and/or if you just really like Canadians, then please donate to this project!</p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><strong>What sort of emotional states can we use to play the single player line of games?</strong></p>
<p>A user will be able to set as concentration or relaxation as his or her desired emotional state to play the 4 casino single player games for now. As new algorithms for other emotional states are developed for the headset, we will include them into updates to the games for users to choose from.        </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will you be adding new algorithms to Neuropoker?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we will be adding new algorithms to Neuropoker, as they become available to us. We strive towards giving online poker players insight into their psyche!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are the single-player line of games and Neuropoker purely brain controlled?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the games will be principally brain controlled. The only way a user can have an effect on his or her gaming outcome is by altering his or her emotional states. Players will be able to view his or her opponent’s emotional states as well as their own in these applications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are the single player line of games and Neuropoker playable without the headset?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, they are playable without the headsets. But, they are no longer considered mind games and are back to being classic casino games.

This headset, developed by NeuroSky, utilizes raw brainwave signals to control the game’s interaction. We chose NeuroMash as our company name because we wanted to “mash-up” classical gaming with this unique and novel form of user interaction. We believe our new “mind-control” casino gaming will offer a ""disruptive"" level of user interaction right along with currently available traditional casino gaming. Just imagine using a ""mind trick” to beat the house in slots. Mind-control casino gaming will offer gamers what they have always wanted, the power to self influence their odds of winning. Nothing captures the imagination like the power of the mind and playing our “mind games” in multiplayer environments, such as our upcoming “Neuropoker” game, will teach you how to hone your real-world poker skills and become a better competitor. Please join us at this critical moment in time for mind-control gaming and “cross the chasm” with us!
 


We are currently at the beginning of the mind game evolution. This is a unique moment to join a brand new industry by helping us put this genre of technology on the gaming map!
 
First, we must work towards the Beta Release of NeuroSlot and our single line of casino games. The beta release will be built through a cross platform strategy using Unity 4.2 and will interface with Neurosky’s MindWave and MindWave Mobile hardware. These will be released on Android, iOS, PC and Mac. For instance, you could view a detailed video description of our prototype for Neuroslot in the gallery section of this campaign. Upon the successful Beta completion, we plan on publishing “Neuroslot” (Slots mind game) followed by “Neurowar” (Casino Wars mind game), “Neurojack” (Blackjack mind game) and “Neuroulette” (Roulette mind game) on Neurosky’s gaming portal. 





Furthermore, each headset comes with several unique algorithms developed by NeuroSky including concentration, relaxation, blinks, task difficulty. and task familiarity activities. To that effect, along with our single player line of casino mind games, we are currently working on an interactive multi-player poker mind game. Just imagine playing Texas Hold ‘Em and although your opponents can’t see your cards, they can see your various biosignals. Yes, we are giving the online Poker enthusiasts what the “live players” have always had. “Tells!” For the first time ever, online poker players will have tells on their opponents. For instance, your opponents will be able to see both your own and your competitor’s level of relaxation and focus during the game.  In the process, you will learn to make better gambling decisions and become better online poker players. Neuropoker can become a valuable “learning tool” for live players! Live players can monitor their online playing activity while playing Neuropoker and learn how to control their real-world poker skills and become a better competitor. Please note that Neuropoker will be a web-based only game and will be offered on Neuromash.com in a multi-player environment.
  




We are on Indiegogo because we know that this is the best way to get our “mind-control” casino games in your hands as soon as possible! With all of the above in mind, we estimate we will need $25,000 for the launch of our initial single player casino mind games and initial development of Neuropoker and other upcoming multi-player mind-control casino games. Join us in creating this new genre of casino games and let’s share our novel vision with the world!


 

   

 

 

 





The core Neuromash team includes Mehran, Daniel and Kevin. Our passion is cutting edge technology and we aim to integrate technology into our everyday activities in a natural and fitting way. Mehran and Kevin are life long friends working in the tech and business sector.They came across thought-controlled computer interface technology back in the fall of 2010 and eventually became infatuated by it. Dan joined the group in the following summer of 2011 right out of college with a fresh degree in computer science and somewhere along the way we combined our backgrounds in computer science and entrepreneurship to create Neuromash. We believe that “mind-control” gaming is in its infancy and will only make every day life more interactive and entertaining. That is why we are asking for your support. We are eager to listen to your feedback once you receive and play our single player casino mind games. If you believe in our futuristic vision of casino gaming, our passion, and/or if you just really like Canadians, then please donate to this project!


 
What sort of emotional states can we use to play the single player line of games?
A user will be able to set as concentration or relaxation as his or her desired emotional state to play the 4 casino single player games for now. As new algorithms for other emotional states are developed for the headset, we will include them into updates to the games for users to choose from.        
 
Will you be adding new algorithms to Neuropoker?
Yes, we will be adding new algorithms to Neuropoker, as they become available to us. We strive towards giving online poker players insight into their psyche!
 
Are the single-player line of games and Neuropoker purely brain controlled?
Yes, the games will be principally brain controlled. The only way a user can have an effect on his or her gaming outcome is by altering his or her emotional states. Players will be able to view his or her opponent’s emotional states as well as their own in these applications.
 
Are the single player line of games and Neuropoker playable without the headset?
Yes, they are playable without the headsets. But, they are no longer considered mind games and are back to being classic casino games. A mind-control casino game is a casino game where the odds of the game are altered by a users emotional state “captured and analyzed” by the headset.One last note regarding classic casino gaming, we plan on eventually offering “mind-control and classic casino gaming"" on Neuromash.com",14.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Nimrod and Linda Jones have worked in the games industry for a number of years doing various jobs within it. Nimrod as a freelance writer, editor and proofreader (predominantly with Cubicle 7 (<a href=""http://www.cubicle7.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cubicle7.co.uk</a>)), Linda as a freelance illustrator and designer (<a href=""http://www.sheblackdragon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sheblackdragon.com</a>). Together, they have a beautiful baby girl and lots of awesome game ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Talking Skull</strong> is the culmination of years of gaming and the launch of a brand new card game, <em>Faustus</em>, by Nimrod Jones, art by George C. Cotronis (<a href=""http://www.ravenkult.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ravenkult.com</a>), due for release later in the year through Angus Abranson's new company, Chronicle City (<a href=""http://www.chroniclecity.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.chroniclecity.com</a>).<br/><br/>Using <em>Faustus</em> as our flagship game, we want to release our other exciting games in development through next year. The darkly occult tactical card game, <em>Faustus</em>, is only the beginning: we have a light-hearted, fun family card game, a Euro-style game of social dynamics and an epic deck building game that’ll blow you away! And that’s just for starters…<br/><br/>With the first two games entering playtesting and the third in development for playtesting, we really want to get these games to you as soon as we can. Dividing time for freelance work, it's taken a long time to get <em>Faustus</em> launched, but we want to get these other awesome games out sooner and really get this new gaming company up to a running start.<br/><br/>We're so excited about them and we know you will be too. To give these games the full attention they deserve, to thoroughly playtest, develop the art and rules, we need your help! If we are to work full time on these games, we're likely to have very little other sources of freelance income and with a baby girl to provide for this won't be possible within the time-frame we would like.<br/><br/><em>Faustus</em> is already in layout and has had a preview print made. This made its debut at UKGamesExpo in Birmingham in May and was very well received. We need to make a few tweaks to the layout, correct a few typos, but it's all good to go to the printers as soon as we can afford it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we're ready to start turning out the art on our other two games while also getting them into playtesting to get the rules down pat. With your help funding us to give us time to dedicate to our work, we can realistically look at these games hitting the shelves no later than next year (if we can dedicate enough time to push getting at least one of them out by Christmas, we'll be very happy!).</p>
<p>We're asking for $4,000, but the more we get the better we can do! This covers start up capital and ""breathing room"". This lets us get components to make decent prototypes for playtesting, gives us the time to concentrate on producing the art promptly and do the layout. Some of our games ideas have already had a lot of work put into them, others are really cool but big projects that require a lot of time to make.</p>
<p>The more money we get the more we can put back into those projects when we get to seeking funding for them independently. We can lower the amount we need to ask for by already having a large chunk of it from you now.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we'll still put that money to good use to give us as much time as that money will allow to focus on what we can. It might stretch our timeline a little as we won't be able to get as much done, so we might only get one game out next year instead of two.</p>
</div>
<div>Even if you can't donate much, whatever you can afford will be greatly appreciated. You can still help by really letting people know that we're doing this. I'll be honest, if Kickstarter was available to the UK, we'd probably be doing it there, so let your friends know about us and that we're on Indiegogo.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We'll expand the Perks available soon after this fundraiser launches, so if nothing grabs you now, please come back and check again.</div>

<p>However now the enemies follow you and they don't walk across the walls and the game objects, they also do a waypoint path or go in random movement and if you are in a certain distance they attack you with punch, if you run behind an house they don't see you so they stop to follow you and turn back to their path.</p>

<p>A strong Website shows a Strong Guild. It's with the first exposure many players will have to our guild. As well as the pulse of the guild's activity itself.

<p>Retro Fusion has been in touch with infamous ZX Spectrum developer Jonathan Cauldwell. JC is going to be producing us a unique Retro Fusion game with a SCI - FI theme to our liking in parallel with Spanner writing a background story to the game. This will make a facinating article and the game, once finished, will be on the front cover of Retro Fusion issue 3 in cassette form for you to play on your ZX Spectrum (there will be a digital version to download also to play on Emulators).

<p>#1 Interview with Ste Pickford</p>
<p>The Pickford Brothers have had an illustrious career that has spanned decades. We here at Retro Fusion had the pleasure of talking to Ste Pickford this week about the obscure title they made for the SNES back in the early 1990's called Plok. Ever heard of this game? Seems like not many have - we have an article on the game coming in issue 3 and a nice long interview with Ste to discuss the merits of the title.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><em><strong>Retro Fusion</strong></em> as a magazine started back in 2005 as a token read to those who attended a retro event I held in central England in aid of the Everyman charity. Those who came to the gig, comprising of arcade cabinets, pinball tables and a plethora of retro consoles and computers, received a copy of the magazine as a thank you. Over a £1,000 was raised for charity.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.retrofusion.me.uk/images/stories/logo1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The magazine covers the retro games and systems that you played with in your youth. We also venture into the films and TV programmes you watched in between gaming, the sweets you sucked whlist playing Jetpac and even the toys you played with whilst waiting for Uridium to load on your Commodore 64! All in full glorious colour spread across 68 pages.</p>
<p>Two further issues of the <em><strong>Retro Fusion</strong></em> magazine were produced and distributed in the Gamestation stores in the UK - this was 6 years ago.</p>
<p>I now have a desire to continue <em><strong>Retro Fusion</strong> </em>and we are now looking to the community to help fund the print of the next issue of the magazine. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need!</h3>
<p>Primarily the funds to print 500 issues of the next issue of the magazine.</p>
<p>A portion of the remaining fund will go to those who to date have largely written for the magazine for free - I feel it is would be great to give something back to those who have made the brand so special over the years.</p>
<p>Then there is the marketing - the remaining budget will go on making sure the largest possible audience is aware of the <em><strong>Retro Fusion</strong></em> magazine. </p>
<p>The development of this issue of <em><strong>Retro Fusion</strong></em> is well underway and features the following within its pages and much more:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Making of Z - <strong><em>Retro Fusion</em></strong> interviews Mike Montgomery</li>
<li>A day in the life of OCEAN - written by Ocean employee Mark Jones</li>
<li>A look back at the Red Dwarf series</li>
<li>Archer Maclean's Top 10 Favourite restored arcade cabinets</li>
<li>The Top 10 Science Fiction Games across all gaming platforms</li>
<li>Your favourite Top 10 Science Fiction Robots</li>
<li>Plok - A Pickford Brothers Classic</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Previous issues of <em><strong>Retro Fusion</strong></em> have seen retro celebrities putting pen to paper and contributing  - this issue will be no different with Archer Maclean sharing pictures and thoughts on his favourite 10 arcade cabinets and Jeroen Tel telling us a little about SID music and what it still means to him.</p>

<p class=""Standard""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""Standard""><em></em> “100 years ago this very morning, as the dawn blazed across all the lands of Dashiri, a single child was born in the city of Ebon Dene. They say she had the sun in her hair and the sky in her eyes. No soul remembers who she was, but all remember what she was.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">   “She was a 'Dene', one who could shape the lands and bend the very elements to her will. There were those of superstition who called it 'magic', but reason and hindsight offer a more accurate answer: as man came to dominate the natural world with the gift of reason, the Dene would one day come to dominate man.” - Peptus Clove, The Changing Times.</p>

<p class=""Standard""><strong>Why Indie Go Go</strong></p>
<p class=""Standard""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Standard"">   Fate of Ages began production a long time ago as a game for original Xbox. The game got to a certain point and just could not get sufficient funding from the big publishers at that time, who just weren’t interested in this kind of product.Years later, the market place has changed and indie go go is a place where ideas like this can become a reality. Also several years in the industry has taught us all to be better at what we do and how we do it, so we now feel we can bring you the best possible version of Fate of Ages.</p>
<p class=""Standard""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""Standard""><strong>Where funds go</strong></p>
<p class=""Standard""><strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">   Fate of Ages production was restarted on the 28<sup>th</sup> of May 2011, and we have spent our time creating a core RPG engine and set of tools, as well designing our tactical combat system. We have also spent the time putting together a great story and great characters, as well as art concepts for characters and locations. As of this moment, we need funding to produce the final versions of assets and music. This will include</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">fully animated sprites for numerous families of monsters</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">a variety of main plot and side quest bosses</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">the complete artwork for five or more different environments and related towns that the player will visit over the course the adventure</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">a top quality musical score, over one hour in length, specially composed for Fate of Ages.</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">   If we fail to reach our funding goal, we still intend to see this project to completion, though the time scales may have to be reassessed. If we exceed our stated target, we will be able to consider a number of additional extras to the game, such as optional bosses, additional side quests and new options for character development. With enough money, we would ideally like to produce a version of the game on the Xbox 360.</p>

 “100 years ago this very morning, as the dawn blazed across all the lands of Dashiri, a single child was born in the city of Ebon Dene. They say she had the sun in her hair and the sky in her eyes. No soul remembers who she was, but all remember what she was.
   “She was a 'Dene', one who could shape the lands and bend the very elements to her will. There were those of superstition who called it 'magic', but reason and hindsight offer a more accurate answer: as man came to dominate the natural world with the gift of reason, the Dene would one day come to dominate man.” - Peptus Clove, The Changing Times.
 
   Join Aria Leane, a gifted Dene who joined the oppressors of her people for the sake of a greater peace, in a journey across the known world, fighting to uncover her people's dark past and battling powerful forces who seek to control the future.

Why Indie Go Go
 
   Fate of Ages began production a long time ago as a game for original Xbox. The game got to a certain point and just could not get sufficient funding from the big publishers at that time, who just weren’t interested in this kind of product.Years later, the market place has changed and indie go go is a place where ideas like this can become a reality. Also several years in the industry has taught us all to be better at what we do and how we do it, so we now feel we can bring you the best possible version of Fate of Ages.
 
Where funds go
 
   Fate of Ages production was restarted on the 28th of May 2011, and we have spent our time creating a core RPG engine and set of tools, as well designing our tactical combat system. We have also spent the time putting together a great story and great characters, as well as art concepts for characters and locations. As of this moment, we need funding to produce the final versions of assets and music. This will include

fully animated sprites for numerous families of monsters
a variety of main plot and side quest bosses
the complete artwork for five or more different environments and related towns that the player will visit over the course the adventure
a top quality musical score, over one hour in length, specially composed for Fate of Ages.
   If we fail to reach our funding goal, we still intend to see this project to completion, though the time scales may have to be reassessed. If we exceed our stated target, we will be able to consider a number of additional extras to the game, such as optional bosses, additional side quests and new options for character development. With enough money, we would ideally like to produce a version of the game on the Xbox 360.

<p>Crate 360 is a 3D puzzle game, initially built for the iOS market (iPhone/iPad), but also currently being developed for PC/Mac systems.</p>
<p>The entire game is split into over 220 levels. The aim of each level is to destroy the crates, whilst guiding the jewels to safety. Simply drag your finger (or mouse) across the scene to view the level from all angles, and click crates to destroy them.</p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? It is! Well, for the first few levels it is, then we make things a *tiny* bit complicated...</p>
<p>The main game is split into 15 chapters, where each chapter we bring in a new crate mechanic.</p>

<p>Each crate mechanics has a different reaction when you tap it. Wooden crates, which you'll see from the start, simply destroy themselves, whereas special mechanics such as arrow and magnet shoot across the screen, often making a mess!</p>
<p>When all these elements are combined, its up to you to find the safest way to complete the level. There are millions of ways to complete each level, but there are only a few perfect solutions.</p>

<p>Crate 360 has 3 game modes:</p>
<h2>Arcade</h2>
<p>The main game mode, currently contains 120 levels in 15 chapters.</p>
<p>The goal in this mode is to save as many jewels as possible. Each level will reward 1-3 stars at the end, depending on how many jewels you saved.</p>
<p>We're also in the process of making a further 30 bonus levels, which will be available to backers early, if they fund us $25 or more.</p>
<h2>Classic</h2>
<p>Based of our previous game, <a href=""http://bit.ly/HS0b8x"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Crate Collapse</a>. Contains 100 levels in 10 chapters, and uses a 2.5D gameplay style.</p>
<p>This mode doesn't have a 3 star system like arcade, so the goal is to complete the level, without destroying a single jewel!</p>
<h2>Creative</h2>
<p>Finally, we have creative mode, where you can create your own levels (on all gaming platforms), and download them online.</p>
<p>Levels you create and play in this mode follow the arcade style of gameplay, including the 3 star system &amp; the 360<span>°</span> camera.</p>
<p>You'll be able to share you levels manually, by sending people a 6 letter code associated with your level, or though facebook, twitter, or the in-game level browser.</p>

<p>Crate 360 has most of the work done already. All of the mechanics have been coded, and all of the levels we've mentioned have already been made!</p>
<p>We've also done most of the heavy lifting for the level editor, as all of the levels we're created and uploaded to our server, so we could test them on the fly, instantly!</p>
<p>BUT, the game has a little way to go if we want it polished (which we really do!):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>15 dynamic backgrounds, one for each arcade chapter - </strong>We currently only have 2 backgrounds for that mode, which would get stale quickly. We really want to be able to create fully dynamic backgrounds, ones which react to what you press in the level.</li>
<li>
<strong>Universial UI for each gaming platform</strong> - With the game being available on many platforms, making a user interface easy to use (especially in the level editor) will take a while!</li>
<li>
<strong>Licensed sound and music</strong> - We've been developing all this time without music! We've been making humming sounds and bop noises every time we destroy a crate, but it isn't the same. We've already found some music that would be ideal, we just need it licensed!</li>
<li><strong>And a few minor tweaks here and there.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>This is where we need your help!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Our first hurdle is two professional software licenses </strong>- priced at $3250.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Our game engine of choice is Unity 3D, which we have been using the 'lite' versions of for almost a year. While it works great, many of the advanced features of the professional licenses would speed up the games development significantly, which would allow us to release the game much sooner.</p>
<p><strong>Our second goal is to upgrade our existing PC equipment</strong>, to handle the strain of game development (freezing and crashing slows us down lots!).</p>
<p>Upgrading our current PC fully to handle 3D, art &amp; video software well would cost $885. This would make Thomas, the 3D artist, very happy!</p>
<p>We also need a mac system to port games to the iPhone &amp; iPad. The one we have currently works, but its incredibly old, and has a 1 in 4 chance of turning on! Being able to replace this would cost $1590, and it'd be tremendous if we could.</p>
<p>A cheap android tablet would be the last piece of hardware we would acquire, as it would allow us to test &amp; build our game on an android device. This would ensure we could port our game to the android market.</p>
<p><strong>Our final goal is living working accommodation -  </strong>Stumpytree is only made up of two people, but the amount of time travelling back and forth to collaborate is huge! Our current working environments are also less than ideal.</p>
<p>Any money we get past $6000 would go into a few months accommodation, so we could create the ideal work environment and concentrate solely on Crate 360 development.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Welcome to the „The Great Chase“ indiegogo page. The Great Chase is an indie game , where you play one of the multiple characters  with their own unique abillity and race with the time to set the highscore. Greatly inspired by the old classic game called „Icy Tower“ , <strong>but with a different gameplay approach.</strong><br/><br/>This is the first game developed by Wolt Studios. Our goal is to make a small indie game , which players will play on and on , trying different characters racing for the first place on the highscore list.</p>
<p>The Great Chase is currently being developed in Unity Engine (free licence) for PC Windows only , and first planned to be release on Steam as free to play game and later for Android,iOs , Max , Linux and Facebook. Currently we're in alpha stage of the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Why Crowdfounding? We feel that crowdfounding is the best way to get close to the community interested in our game , and it will help us create the game as we'd like it to look like.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/i9Efk11.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>- <strong>Multiple Characters </strong>– In the game there will be more then 1 character , and each character has his own unique abillity that impacts the gameplay and unique soundtrack. For example , the first character you get in the game is Ninja , and he has a wall walking abillity.<br/><br/> - <strong>Randomly Generated level</strong> – The game is set on one level that is always randomly generated , so the players will never encounter the same platform positions thus making the game harder.<br/><br/>- <strong>The Store</strong> – Before you start the game you can visit the in-game store to grab some helpful items. For example you can buy rocket boots there , that would save you from falling down. You may only carry 2 items with you per game , so chose wisely. Also you buy your characters in the store , level/platform skins and so on...<br/><br/>- <strong>Challanging Gameplay</strong> -  From the moment you make your first jump in the game , the camera starts speeding up. At the first it’s slow , but as you go higher and higher it gets faster and faster. If you fail to be faster then the camera , the game is done and you have to start again.<br/><br/>- <strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> – There wont be only 1 game mode in „The Great Chase“. The game will have multiple game modes. More info on this incoming in the future.<br/><br/>- <strong>Global highscore list</strong> – The game will have global highscore list , where players will be competing for the first place. At the end of each season (seasons will last about 2-3 months) the highscore list will be reset , and top 3 players will get their rewards.</p>
<p><strong>- Achievements </strong>– There will be a list of achievements players can try to do. Some of them are going to be challanging , some of them just trivial. Some of the achievements will also reward something (e.g character obtainable only through achievement).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/s3jrDE1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
</div>
<div>                                                                           <strong>The Level</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Gameplay in the game is pretty simple and straightforward. First let’s talk</div>
<div>about levels. There’s only „1 level“ that is randomly generated when you enter the game , and it keeps generating as you go higher and higher. The level has no ending and the goal is to set good highscore. There are 3 types on platforms you can encounter , and they all have a certain chance of spawning. <br/><br/> 1. <strong>Regular Platforms</strong> – Just regular platforms you stand on.<br/> 2. <strong>Fall-Down Platforms</strong>  - Stepping on one will trigger it to fall down after few seconds.<br/> 3.<strong> Bouncy Platform</strong> – Stepping on one will bounce you off in the air.<br/><br/> Also there are 2 types of collectables you can encounter atop of platforms :<br/><br/> 1. <strong>Coins</strong> – Collecting the coins will bring you money and will impact your highscore.<br/> 2.<strong> Power-Up Orbs</strong> – Collecting the power-up orb will bring you one step forward to using the special abillity. Three Power-Up orbs are needed in order to use an abillity , and you may have only 3 at a time.<br/><br/>                                                                          <strong>Characters</strong><br/><br/> Next let’s talk about characters and the movement. The movement in the game is pretty simple , you use A and D to move left or right (or arrow keys) , space button to jump and W (or clicking an icon) to trigger special abillity.The character can be moved while he’s in the air. There’s no bouncing off the wall like in traditional jumping games.  There are 3 factors that distinct characters from each other : <br/><br/> 1.<strong> Movement Speed</strong> (the speed at which character moves left or right , impacts the speed in the air aswell). <br/> 2.<strong> Jump Power</strong>  (determines the jump height).<br/> 3. <strong>Character Abillity</strong>  (each character has own unique abillity).<br/><br/><img alt=""Ninja Character"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Cv6bZWP.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><strong>                                                                           The store</strong><br/><br/> Let’s talk about the store system now. Items bought in the store can change gameplay quite abit aswell. In the store you can buy items that are usable in the game , but you may only carry 2 at the time. For example in  the store you can buy<strong> rocket boots</strong> that will give you a lift up (the same height as bouncy platform) or Enchancing Boots that would increase your movement speed etc...<br/><br/> We will reveal more information about the store in the future , and the store will not make it in the first game demo.</div>
<p><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/mkCog6Z.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We decided to start an indiegogo campaign for simple reasons.</strong> So far we haven't invested a dollar in the game , and we have been working on it for about 3 months now.<strong> We would like to raise some money to finish the game faster , and to make it look better</strong>. We can , and we will finish the game no matter what the results of the campaign are, but it will affect the game quality majorly. The more money we rise , the more things we will be able to implement in the game at the start , such as : Multiple game modes at the start , multiple backgrounds (there will be few of them at the start anyways) , 3d backgrounds , more characters and imporved quality of the game in general.</p>
<p>Second reason is keeping us close to the community. Everyone who joins and actually donates or shares this page is curious how the game is gonna end up , and usually these people will give the best feedback to help develop the game in the right way. <strong>So we want to keep these people close and gather their suggestions to make the final product look really good.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/mqc5Ld2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One of our major plans</strong> for the game is to keep it updated , giving players new content every few weeks. Our plan is to release a new character every 3-4 weeks , and a new content patch every 2 months , bringing players new game modes etc...</p>
<p><strong>Our second major plan</strong> is to release the game for Android/iOS , Facebook and consoles. This would require a different approach then what we have now and some gameplay changes , and we need money for the technology needed to port the game (Unity Pro version).</p>
<p><strong>Also , we plan to reward our best players at the end of each season. The reward could be anything , from in-game items to real money. We still have to consider what the rewards will be , but we will for sure have some.</strong> We will tend to keep community close to us , and to have players involved in development of the game as much as possible.</p>
<p>We would also like to expand our team with additional programmer and 3D modeler for the future , but we’re satisfied with our team as it’s now , and it’s unlikely we will see any changes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/rGP2bRo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've been working really hard with the tools we have to get this game off of the ground, however we are now starting to reach the limits of what we're able to produce using our current equipment.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Below is a list of what we're going to be spending the money on:<br/><br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buying Unity Pro licence </strong></li>
<li><strong>Administrative costs </strong></li>
<li><strong>Servers for the game </strong></li>
<li><strong>Better equipment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Advertising</strong></li>

The Great Chase is an indie game , where you play one of the multiple characters  with their own unique abillity and race with the time to set the highscore. Greatly inspired by the old classic game called „Icy Tower“ , but with a different gameplay approach.This is the first game developed by Wolt Studios. Our goal is to make a small indie game , which players will play on and on , trying different characters racing for the first place on the highscore list.
The Great Chase is currently being developed in Unity Engine (free licence) for PC Windows only , and first planned to be release on Steam as free to play game and later for Android,iOs , Max , Linux and Facebook. Currently we're in alpha stage of the game.
 
- Why Crowdfounding? We feel that crowdfounding is the best way to get close to the community interested in our game , and it will help us create the game as we'd like it to look like.
 
 


- Multiple Characters – In the game there will be more then 1 character , and each character has his own unique abillity that impacts the gameplay and unique soundtrack. For example , the first character you get in the game is Ninja , and he has a wall walking abillity. - Randomly Generated level – The game is set on one level that is always randomly generated , so the players will never encounter the same platform positions thus making the game harder.- The Store – Before you start the game you can visit the in-game store to grab some helpful items. For example you can buy rocket boots there , that would save you from falling down. You may only carry 2 items with you per game , so chose wisely. Also you buy your characters in the store , level/platform skins and so on...- Challanging Gameplay -  From the moment you make your first jump in the game , the camera starts speeding up. At the first it’s slow , but as you go higher and higher it gets faster and faster. If you fail to be faster then the camera , the game is done and you have to start again.- Multiple Game Modes – There wont be only 1 game mode in „The Great Chase“. The game will have multiple game modes. More info on this incoming in the future.- Global highscore list – The game will have global highscore list , where players will be competing for the first place. At the end of each season (seasons will last about 2-3 months) the highscore list will be reset , and top 3 players will get their rewards.
- Achievements – There will be a list of achievements players can try to do. Some of them are going to be challanging , some of them just trivial. Some of the achievements will also reward something (e.g character obtainable only through achievement).




                                                                           The Level

 
Gameplay in the game is pretty simple and straightforward. First let’s talk
about levels. There’s only „1 level“ that is randomly generated when you enter the game , and it keeps generating as you go higher and higher. The level has no ending and the goal is to set good highscore. There are 3 types on platforms you can encounter , and they all have a certain chance of spawning.  1. Regular Platforms – Just regular platforms you stand on. 2. Fall-Down Platforms  - Stepping on one will trigger it to fall down after few seconds. 3. Bouncy Platform – Stepping on one will bounce you off in the air. Also there are 2 types of collectables you can encounter atop of platforms : 1. Coins – Collecting the coins will bring you money and will impact your highscore. 2. Power-Up Orbs – Collecting the power-up orb will bring you one step forward to using the special abillity. Three Power-Up orbs are needed in order to use an abillity , and you may have only 3 at a time.                                                                          Characters Next let’s talk about characters and the movement. The movement in the game is pretty simple , you use A and D to move left or right (or arrow keys) , space button to jump and W (or clicking an icon) to trigger special abillity.The character can be moved while he’s in the air. There’s no bouncing off the wall like in traditional jumping games.  There are 3 factors that distinct characters from each other :  1. Movement Speed (the speed at which character moves left or right , impacts the speed in the air aswell).  2. Jump Power  (determines the jump height). 3. Character Abillity  (each character has own unique abillity).                                                                           The store Let’s talk about the store system now. Items bought in the store can change gameplay quite abit aswell. In the store you can buy items that are usable in the game , but you may only carry 2 at the time. For example in  the store you can buy rocket boots that will give you a lift up (the same height as bouncy platform) or Enchancing Boots that would increase your movement speed etc... We will reveal more information about the store in the future , and the store will not make it in the first game demo.

 
We decided to start an indiegogo campaign for simple reasons. So far we haven't invested a dollar in the game , and we have been working on it for about 3 months now. We would like to raise some money to finish the game faster , and to make it look better. We can , and we will finish the game no matter what the results of the campaign are, but it will affect the game quality majorly. The more money we rise , the more things we will be able to implement in the game at the start , such as : Multiple game modes at the start , multiple backgrounds (there will be few of them at the start anyways) , 3d backgrounds , more characters and imporved quality of the game in general.
Second reason is keeping us close to the community. Everyone who joins and actually donates or shares this page is curious how the game is gonna end up , and usually these people will give the best feedback to help develop the game in the right way. So we want to keep these people close and gather their suggestions to make the final product look really good.
 
 
 

 
 
One of our major plans for the game is to keep it updated , giving players new content every few weeks. Our plan is to release a new character every 3-4 weeks , and a new content patch every 2 months , bringing players new game modes etc...
Our second major plan is to release the game for Android/iOS , Facebook and consoles. This would require a different approach then what we have now and some gameplay changes , and we need money for the technology needed to port the game (Unity Pro version).
Also , we plan to reward our best players at the end of each season. The reward could be anything , from in-game items to real money. We still have to consider what the rewards will be , but we will for sure have some. We will tend to keep community close to us , and to have players involved in development of the game as much as possible.
We would also like to expand our team with additional programmer and 3D modeler for the future , but we’re satisfied with our team as it’s now , and it’s unlikely we will see any changes.
 
 
 
We've been working really hard with the tools we have to get this game off of the ground, however we are now starting to reach the limits of what we're able to produce using our current equipment.
 
Below is a list of what we're going to be spending the money on:

Buying Unity Pro licence 
Administrative costs 
Servers for the game 
Better equipment
Advertising

<h2><strong>Why am I making this game?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Hi my name is James Arndt. I'm a professional game developer based out of Ormond Beach, Florida. You can take a peek at some of my work, and a list of games I've worked on that shipped to market: </span><a href=""http://www.jamesarndt3d.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jamesarndt3d.com/about/<br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16956434/Kart_Race_Demo/Credits.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a><a href=""http://www.jamesarndt3d.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><br/><br/></a><span>I've come from a background of working on a couple of Need for Speed titles and along the way I developed a real affinity for car racing games. This current project of mine, Super Kart Racing, is a labor of love and one that I want to share with the world via their mobile devices and tablets. I am working with a small team of (3) under the name fatbox Software. This is our small development studio based in Central Florida.<br/><br/><span>I noticed that there was a serious lack of kart racing games to be found in the mobile markets, that focused on a more realistic simulation of racing go karts. Seeing this opening in the market, combined with a love for vehicle racing games, led me to start development on Super Kart Racing quite some time ago.</span><br/><br/><em>Screenshot of the game as of Feb. 2013:</em><br/></span></p>

<h1>What will gameplay be like?</h1>
<p>There are currently (6) main track layouts, with a bonus track that is only unlocked once all prior tracks are completed. Each of the (6) track layouts will be run in reverse configurations as well, creating a total of (13) tracks for this game. The game will use an unlock system, in which initially all tracks but the first will be locked. As you progress, competing against (2) other AI opponents, and win races, you will unlock tracks progressively. Each new track will present new challenges in navigating the course. These will be present in the difficulty of a track's layout or the competitive paths the AI opponents will choose to race along.</p>
<p>I'm also implementing local multi-player via Bluetooth and/or Wifi using the Prime31 Bluetooth/WiFi Mulitplayer plugin for Unity. This will allow players who are near to each other to engage in races against one another. There will be a simple multi-player lobby in the game's menu, you will find any competitors in this lobby to race.<br/><br/><img alt=""Track Layout Designs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16956434/Kart_Race_Demo/Track_Layouts.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>

<p>I've also started development on a fully driveable demo track to demo the game to the public. I am demoing the game via  web streaming using Unity Game Engine's Web Player tech (simple, light browser plugin). I am also using updates to the online web streaming build to gain valuable feedback from users in forums and on official pages. I gain knowledge of bugs that become apparent, features players would like to see implemented, feedback on the vehicle handling and feedback on game design elements. I think this is a valuable step in the development to ensure a high level of quality is reach for the end product.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing QA list of features to work on or improve based on community feedback. I've publicized this list directly on the Super Kart Racing web page so that others can see what is being worked on and make new suggestions for improvement.

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p><em><strong>Special Note for perks:</strong></em></p>
<p><em>In game advertising, and in-game characters will be placed on a first come, first serve basis. The early contributors (in order) will get first choice of placement in the game environments. There is ample space in every environment for high visibility.</em></p>
<p><strong>This game will be distributed to iOS devices via Apple's App store, to Android devices via Google Play and to certain backers as a stand alone PC version via direct download<em>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Specific Minimum Device Support:</em></strong></p>
<p>Android OS 2.0 or later<br/>Device powered by an ARMv7 (Cortex family) CPU</p>
<p>iOS 4.3 or later<br/>ARMv7 (Cortex family) CPU<br/>iPhone 3GS and newer</p>
<p><br/>The funds generated via this campaign will allow me to complete this game with an expected release in July 2013. This will allow me to realize this game to it's full potential, as it's always been pushed aside for paying work. This is a Unity Game Engine based project. Funds will be used to acquire an upgrade license to Unity 4.0, to take advantage of new optimizations and bug fixes within the Unity editor environment itself. Important licensing fees will need to be paid as well. I will need to renew my iOS Developer License this February as well as purchase the Android Developer License. Funds will also be used to acquire needed prop or environment models for future artwork needs. I will need assistance in general prop modeling, some of the reverse track configs will require movement of barricades, signage, etc.<br/><br/>I will also use funds for Sumner McCarty's time (assisting programmer/former Firebrand co-worker) to look over my scripts, clean up my code, offer more efficient code structure, etc. He’ll be more in a consultant capacity and will be paid an hourly consulting fee. I will also use funds to purchase required audio assets from online sources. We will also need to purchase at least one Android handset device for testing. All initial testing for Android will be done via emulation. Lastly funds are needed to acquire the Prime31 plugins for implementing wifi/bluetooth multiplayer into the game. After development needs are met, this funding will allow me to sustain myself during development on Super Kart Racing.</p>
<p><span> </span>As with any game development it's important to know the strengths and risks up front. Currently the game is about 25% feature complete.I feel the biggest hurdle to completion might be solving difficult bugs. My strengths as an environment, prop and vehicle artist will allow me to produce the game's needed artwork relatively smoothly. QA and solving hard to find bugs seem to be the largest time killer. I intend to help mitigate this by using frequent TestFlight builds to approved testers, usage of the Unity forums and Unity Answers forums, utilizing an already existing network of professional developer friends, and by my own knowledge of QA and debugging racing games. A good example: While working on Need for Speed Undercover I averaged the closing out of 35-50 bugs each day, for a period of several weeks. </p>
<p>All programming will be completed in-house, so there will be no issues with outsourced scripting. I am a capable programmer, that can handle most challenges, issues or logic that is required. If I do hit a hurdle, I immediately reach out to programming professionals I am connected to through prior working relationships. I do not anticipate complications with builds or testing to the devices as iOS testing has gone smoothly so far. I have credentials and certificates installed on both an iPad2 and iPhone 3GS, as well as access to an iPhone 4S for testing.

</div></div>","Why am I making this game?
Hi my name is James Arndt. I'm a professional game developer based out of Ormond Beach, Florida. You can take a peek at some of my work, and a list of games I've worked on that shipped to market: http://www.jamesarndt3d.com/about/I've come from a background of working on a couple of Need for Speed titles and along the way I developed a real affinity for car racing games. This current project of mine, Super Kart Racing, is a labor of love and one that I want to share with the world via their mobile devices and tablets. I am working with a small team of (3) under the name fatbox Software. This is our small development studio based in Central Florida.I noticed that there was a serious lack of kart racing games to be found in the mobile markets, that focused on a more realistic simulation of racing go karts. Seeing this opening in the market, combined with a love for vehicle racing games, led me to start development on Super Kart Racing quite some time ago.Screenshot of the game as of Feb. 2013:



 




What will gameplay be like?
There are currently (6) main track layouts, with a bonus track that is only unlocked once all prior tracks are completed. Each of the (6) track layouts will be run in reverse configurations as well, creating a total of (13) tracks for this game. The game will use an unlock system, in which initially all tracks but the first will be locked. As you progress, competing against (2) other AI opponents, and win races, you will unlock tracks progressively. Each new track will present new challenges in navigating the course. These will be present in the difficulty of a track's layout or the competitive paths the AI opponents will choose to race along.
I'm also implementing local multi-player via Bluetooth and/or Wifi using the Prime31 Bluetooth/WiFi Mulitplayer plugin for Unity. This will allow players who are near to each other to engage in races against one another. There will be a simple multi-player lobby in the game's menu, you will find any competitors in this lobby to race.

Follow links to Youtube real time footage:

What does some of the early work look like?
I will be creating (5) variations of Player Karts to choose from, each with their own distinct markings and paint. The AI opponents will consist of (3) variations of design and paint color. There will be (15) choices of unique decals/ numbering/lettering for each kart selection. 
This is a peek at the current Player Kart driver (without markings or design):


I've also started development on a fully driveable demo track to demo the game to the public. I am demoing the game via  web streaming using Unity Game Engine's Web Player tech (simple, light browser plugin). I am also using updates to the online web streaming build to gain valuable feedback from users in forums and on official pages. I gain knowledge of bugs that become apparent, features players would like to see implemented, feedback on the vehicle handling and feedback on game design elements. I think this is a valuable step in the development to ensure a high level of quality is reach for the end product.
There is an ongoing QA list of features to work on or improve based on community feedback. I've publicized this list directly on the Super Kart Racing web page so that others can see what is being worked on and make new suggestions for improvement. Please visit the page and view the list:Visit the Super Kart Racing Official Website
Here is screengrab of the current demo level that is playable via the web:


Give the Early Build Demo a Try:

If you do have the Unity Web Player plugin installed you can follow this link to an immediately playable demo that plays via web streaming. This demo contains all of the functional controls for iOS and Android in the HUD, but utilizes the keyboard controls for PC/Mac testing. This is a great opportunity for anyone and everyone to provide feedback via comments, towards improving Super Kart Racing's development.


Super Kart Racing (Early Test Build)

What We Need & What You Get
Special Note for perks:
In game advertising, and in-game characters will be placed on a first come, first serve basis. The early contributors (in order) will get first choice of placement in the game environments. There is ample space in every environment for high visibility.
This game will be distributed to iOS devices via Apple's App store, to Android devices via Google Play and to certain backers as a stand alone PC version via direct download.
 Specific Minimum Device Support:
Android OS 2.0 or laterDevice powered by an ARMv7 (Cortex family) CPU
iOS 4.3 or laterARMv7 (Cortex family) CPUiPhone 3GS and newer
The funds generated via this campaign will allow me to complete this game with an expected release in July 2013. This will allow me to realize this game to it's full potential, as it's always been pushed aside for paying work. This is a Unity Game Engine based project. Funds will be used to acquire an upgrade license to Unity 4.0, to take advantage of new optimizations and bug fixes within the Unity editor environment itself. Important licensing fees will need to be paid as well. I will need to renew my iOS Developer License this February as well as purchase the Android Developer License. Funds will also be used to acquire needed prop or environment models for future artwork needs. I will need assistance in general prop modeling, some of the reverse track configs will require movement of barricades, signage, etc.I will also use funds for Sumner McCarty's time (assisting programmer/former Firebrand co-worker) to look over my scripts, clean up my code, offer more efficient code structure, etc. He’ll be more in a consultant capacity and will be paid an hourly consulting fee. I will also use funds to purchase required audio assets from online sources. We will also need to purchase at least one Android handset device for testing. All initial testing for Android will be done via emulation. Lastly funds are needed to acquire the Prime31 plugins for implementing wifi/bluetooth multiplayer into the game. After development needs are met, this funding will allow me to sustain myself during development on Super Kart Racing.
 As with any game development it's important to know the strengths and risks up front. Currently the game is about 25% feature complete.I feel the biggest hurdle to completion might be solving difficult bugs. My strengths as an environment, prop and vehicle artist will allow me to produce the game's needed artwork relatively smoothly. QA and solving hard to find bugs seem to be the largest time killer. I intend to help mitigate this by using frequent TestFlight builds to approved testers, usage of the Unity forums and Unity Answers forums, utilizing an already existing network of professional developer friends, and by my own knowledge of QA and debugging racing games. A good example: While working on Need for Speed Undercover I averaged the closing out of 35-50 bugs each day, for a period of several weeks. 
All programming will be completed in-house, so there will be no issues with outsourced scripting. I am a capable programmer, that can handle most challenges, issues or logic that is required. If I do hit a hurdle, I immediately reach out to programming professionals I am connected to through prior working relationships. I do not anticipate complications with builds or testing to the devices as iOS testing has gone smoothly so far. I have credentials and certificates installed on both an iPad2 and iPhone 3GS, as well as access to an iPhone 4S for testing. Android testing will be done first via emulation in the development environment and then on actual purchased Android hardware. I have successfully submitted and was approved to Apple's app store before (Tablet Match game), so I am familiar with their processing/approval time and technical rules for submission.
The current lack of funding poses the biggest risk to the completion of this project, but hopefully we can solve that as a team! The great part of Indiegogo is the fact that it uses flexible funding, meaning development can still be funded even if we don't entirely hit the goal amount.
The Impact

This campaign will allow me to bring a great kart racing experience to the mass audiences of mobile platforms. It will allow friends to compete against each other and hopefully bring back some of those go karting memories from childhood. The game will also be very reachable to a wide spectrum of consumers, with a price point of $2.00 for a download from Apple's App Store and the Android Marketplace.

<blockquote>Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is celebrating its 30-year anniversary! Since 1983, the organization has raised more than $4.7 billion—most of it $1 at a time—for 170 children’s hospitals across the United States and Canada, which, in turn, use the money where it’s needed the most.

<p>Any donation amount is greatly appreciated! As a thank you to donors at the $25 and above level, they will be able to help choose what games Pat and Ian play! Donors who select those perks have the option of making the donation in the name of any NES title released during the system's original run (via Indiegogo's comment system). The more money raised in the name of any individual game, the more time will be allotted for Pat and Ian to play it! The NES marathon really relies on the input of the viewers so help out a great cause and help make the event what you want to watch! Another bonus in donating: since this is a charitable organization, your contribution will be 100% tax deductible!</p>

<h3>Sponsorship Opportunities</h3>
<p>Another way in which The Annual NES Marathon is able to raise money is by offering visibility and advertising to websites, organizations, businesses, and individuals who wish to make a larger donation and help sponsor the event. In return for these generous donations the donor will receive exposure in the form of banners on the marathon's main page, radio style read-out ads, commercial spots during regular break times, and at the highest levels call-ins and dedicated hour blocks. Tens of thousands of viewers watched the 3rd Annual event last year... here's your chance for your website/business to gain some great exposure while helping out a great cause with a 100% tax-deductible donation! Please check out the available package perks.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Spreading the Word</h3>
<p>The NES Marathon's success is based largely upon others spreading the word via Twitter, Facebook, etc. Indiegogo.com can actually track how many donation referrals come in through your retweeting, posting the link, etc. To show our appreciation, we will reward the person responsible with the most donation referrals with a prize!

<li>One of the most challenging decisions we faced when designing this game was character customization and playability. We have made it so you can only be a human, and made it to where you only played as your character. This is YOUR story.</li>
<li>We have given you full control over the game, and the story, with no cut scenes. Nearly every aspect of this game is playable.</li>

<li>The choices open to you are immense. Sometimes the choices define others too. Your reputation will impact which characters you can interact with, and how they interact with you.</li>

We have analyzed the most common of these though, and have done the best we can to prevent these.</p><p>Scope Creep: Scope creep is a huge reason why games fail. Games are cool. As developers work on a project, they start to see more and more potential for cool stuff in their game. All of a sudden they end up with a bloated nightmare of additional features and content, and eventually the project collapses under its own weight. <br/>Our Solution: We have firmly established what will be in this game. No new mechanics will be added. This doesn't mean there's not room to evolve, but monetary and time limitations are clear to us. If we do have a great idea, we'll save it for a sequel. </p><p>Budget Overreach: Even when the risks of scope/feature creep are eliminated, emergencies pop up, and sometimes, budget meant for one part of the game needs to be shuffled to another. <br/>Our Solution: By designing the game planet by planet, we've ensured development is modular. We intend to have 20 planets at launch, with even more available as DLC. However, the game will be complete, playable, and fun with only 3 planets- as long as our budge covers those locations, we'll have an amazing game for you. Everything else is icing on the cake!</p><p>Timeline:  We do not have a timeline to share yet.  We are incredibly early in the development cycle and we don't want to make promises we can not keep.  That being said, the mechanics of the game are decided on and no new major features will be added.  My team is devoted, passionate, and excited for the project, and is an amazing team.  I am very lucky to have stumbled upon every one of them.  The discussions that the team has had puts this game development between a year and a year and a half, just to make sure it is done the right way. However early releases and delays happen, but we will keep you all updated every step of the way with weekly progress videos, social media chats, discord discussions, and prizes along the way.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534883645/dkpk7fpt3osjedznzl33.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The amount of luck required to put together a team, being at the right place at the right time with the right project with the right ad, is insane.  The amount of luck required to have that team be a passionate network of people that work together beautifully and do an amazing job, is even more, and yet that is what we have here.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534885076/aahkbowrapns1phhglmt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534885122/sovvn3a3ujyiedz4d7r0.png"" src=""""/></p><p>$25,000- Pulling back from our $50,000 goal, this new goal will cover the complete story and single player adventure and cover 10 planets.</p><p>$50,000- So $50,000 is now a stretch goal. This goal covers the main story line as well as the story mode we have for those less interested in games. This should cover our planned 20 original planets.</p><p>$100,000- Our goal with mobile phones was to make this game freely accessible to all, however some people prefer a larger screen. This goal will take our game and help us port it over to Steam which, just like the mobile version, will be completely free.</p><p>$150,000- We want people to enjoy our game, not just alone, but also together.

This future fantasy, top down shooter offers a large variety of choice in both combat and narrative as the two weave together to create a near infinite number of unique, epic experiences, allowing you to live the story your way.The Milky Way Galaxy, in the 31st century, found us helping create an entente with various alien species.  In a collaborated effort of peace, we entered into a contract that states that all within the alliance of HIVE are all devoted to each other and each other’s citizens. As a condition of this pact, HIVE created a space station were each nation sends civilians to live in harmony with one another, or at least that is the idea. The rest of the story is entirely up to you.
This game measures how kind, loyal, and how moral your decisions are. Playing the hero doesn’t make you a nice person, and being loyal to a slaver isn’t moral.
Going into a mission is always easier with the right information. Purchasing maps, talking with locals, and surveying the area can turn the tides of battle.
Fight from the ground or from space as you tackle missions from multiple angles.
Choose your side from dozens of conflicts.  Decide whether to fight or see if your words can sway enemies to your side.
As you can see your decisions, your methods, and even your mannerisms decide how the entire story unfolds. No matter how often you play the game, or even watch this game’s streams, you won’t likely see or play the exact same game or story more than once.You will meet interesting people of various races, study exotic creatures and habitats, and resolve conflicts your way. As you explore and learn more about the galaxy, new and rewarding paths may open up to you. 
Exploring alien cultures helps you understand their weaknesses and strength.
Find what plants and animals can be used for food, medicine, or camouflage.
Find out what makes wildlife tic, explore their caverns, or have them combat threats.
Find unique upgrades to your arsenal.
Learn new languages to help you with trade or your missions. 

One of the most challenging decisions we faced when designing this game was character customization and playability. We have made it so you can only be a human, and made it to where you only played as your character. This is YOUR story.
We have given you full control over the game, and the story, with no cut scenes. Nearly every aspect of this game is playable.
There are a lot of side characters and stories and exposition is often the best way to tell them, but instead we have G.H.O.S.T. stories, special missions that break all of the rules I just told you. These are optional missions where you play as the storyteller and witness their story through game play. 
When we designed this game, these three words helps shape every level, every mission, every conversation that we make. This is our level design creed. These rules take each level and make it where every time you play, every time you watch a stream of this game, it will be different.
The choices open to you are immense. Sometimes the choices define others too. Your reputation will impact which characters you can interact with, and how they interact with you.
Life moves on as you embark on your journey.  G.H.O.S.T. takes place in a living, breathing world which changes regardless of your involvement, changing with every planet you visit, and every choice you make.
In this game you don’t retry. Whether you win, loose, are imprisoned, or retreat, the story continues.  Death isn’t the end, but instead the beginning of a different solution.  
Everything that we have spoken about so far, which is no small amount, is just for the single player. Now here is everything we have for the multiplayer.
Drop In/ Drop Out Coop: Play by yourself or with up to three friends as you carry experience and loot with you.
Arenas: We have three in game arenas that are worked out for the multiplayer experience where new challenges can be completed for new rewards.
Reworked Maps: We have reworked the planets in game into great multiplayer arenas for all types of game modes from classic death match to battle royal to brand new modes.
International Tournaments: We will host tournaments to find the best players. We will offer rare and new weapons special for these tournaments.
We feel a responsibility to do everything we can to help out other people. We will be hosting tournaments, with an entry fee, where all the proceeds go towards the charities that we are forming relationships with. We have a relationship with MD Anderson, the leading cancer research center in the world and hope to develop more, even asking you for suggestions.
Golin ball is one of several mini games that can be enjoyed alone, with friends, or even as a tournament for charity.
We want everyone to have the chance to experience our world and the stories within it. As such we are working on a special mode for those that do not play games, but instead can explore the world and live through the stories it offers without the combat.
We have planned DLC packages for both the single and multiplayer games, and even have 2 sequels in the plan to give people more of what they already love.
We will be coming out of the gate streaming and eSports friendly.
Accessibility is an essential for me which is why the controls are carefully considered, the game is completely free for the Android and iOS, and a offer carefully considered difficulties for everyone. There will be ads and a few in app purchases, but no new content will need cash to be unlocked and above all NO LOOT BOXES!!!
We also want to make the gaming experience for the disabled exceptional.  We will include auditory and visual aids in the game, include options for larger text and notices, provide speech as text and vice versa, and a story mode for those just interested in the adventure.  As the community grows, we hope to add features for all to enjoy our game.
Thank you for coming to view this page. As you see we need $25,000 to complete the game.  This cash will be divided between our three teams, the programming team, the art team, and the writing team.  Each of these teams plays an essential part in completing their section of the game, but each team works together to make sure that not only each part is perfect, but also blends perfectly with the other parts.However we can not get there without your help.Every page view, social media share, and dollar makes a difference to helping us get to our cash goal and just getting the exposure we need. We have a $1 perk where your name goes into the credits. If you think this game looks even remotely interesting, drop a dollar. Change from your grocery trip or laundry cash are happily accepted, but above all, tell someone else about this. Share this page, like our content, and take just one person who has a smartphone and ask them to drop just $1 on this page.Indiegogo's website measures how many times the short link is shared, how many comments I get on my page, and how many answers and updates I give.  This all helps push us to the front page.  So please come in, leave a comment, and if you can, a dollar would help as well.We have a flexible funding goal set up, this means that if we do not make our goal, we keep the money.  However that doesn't mean it is over.  We will take what we get, put it towards the game, and come back with a better project to crowdfund the rest.  Nothing goes to waste and all perks carry over.Follow us on every social media page you can and get on our discord channel. We will be dropping news here, but also hosting events and Q and As so be ready to not only be apart of the game, but also a part of the community.Thank you for your help in keeping the galaxy safe, and welcome to G.H.O.S.T.As with any game, there are no guarantees. There are risks and pitfalls that all developers run into. We have analyzed the most common of these though, and have done the best we can to prevent these.Scope Creep: Scope creep is a huge reason why games fail. Games are cool. As developers work on a project, they start to see more and more potential for cool stuff in their game. All of a sudden they end up with a bloated nightmare of additional features and content, and eventually the project collapses under its own weight. Our Solution: We have firmly established what will be in this game. No new mechanics will be added. This doesn't mean there's not room to evolve, but monetary and time limitations are clear to us. If we do have a great idea, we'll save it for a sequel. Budget Overreach: Even when the risks of scope/feature creep are eliminated, emergencies pop up, and sometimes, budget meant for one part of the game needs to be shuffled to another. Our Solution: By designing the game planet by planet, we've ensured development is modular. We intend to have 20 planets at launch, with even more available as DLC. However, the game will be complete, playable, and fun with only 3 planets- as long as our budge covers those locations, we'll have an amazing game for you.

<p><span>ウサ耳娘を主人公にするゲームが欲しい、このゲームはそういうあなたに捧げますーーーーー2D横スクロールアクション　+　探索ゲーム
<br/>主人公「エリナ」は平和な日常を送る極普通のウサギです。ある日突然、彼女は見知らず土地で現れて、しかも人間になりました！目的のない旅の中、彼女は明るい可憐な妖精「リボン」と出会いました。
<br/>これで、二人の家を帰る旅が始まった。多分黒幕が探し出せますかな？ </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is always not enough games with a bunny girl as the protagonist. So here is another one for all the bunny lovers — A 2D sidescrolling plus exploration platformer.</p>
<p>Erina, the protagonist ,was a normal rabbit that lived in a peaceful life …That was until one day, she found herself in an unknown place and noticed her apperance turned into a human.</p>
<p>During her aimless wandering , she meet the cheerful pink haired fairy – Ribbon, who, for some reason, want to stick with Erina.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Arial, sans-serif;'>Therefore, without any choices, an adventure of a bunny and a fairy searching for the way to home has started. And perhaps even finding out who is the reason of causing all of this trouble as well?</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Arial, sans-serif;'>讓兔耳娘當主角的遊戲總是不嫌多，所以這是款獻給兔耳愛好者的遊戲 — 一款 2D 橫向捲軸 + 平台探險動作遊戲。<br/>遊戲的主角，Erina，是一隻生活在寧靜生活的普通兔子… 直到那天，她發現她身在未知的地方且變成了人類。 經歷了沒有目的的流浪後，她遇見一隻活潑的粉髮妖精 – Ribbon，因為一些原因她決定跟隨 Erina。 在沒有選擇的情況下。一隻兔子和一隻妖精踏上了尋找家園的冒險。也許會找出這一切都是誰在搞鬼的說？<br/></span></p>

<p><span>「ラビリビ」は2D探索横スクロールアクションゲーム、要するに固定のルートはありません。ゲーム中、次のエピソードへ行くヒントは与えますが、プレイヤー達はヒントを従う必要がありません。自分の想いでゲームの進行を調整できます。<br/><br/>プレイヤー達は近接攻撃を使ううさ耳娘「エリナ」と遠距離攻撃を使う妖精「リボン」を使えます<br/>「エリナ」は普通のウサギから変化した人間ですので、強いパワーを持つとか期待しないてくださいね！<br/>ですがゲームの進行と伴う、探索可能の領域が広くなり、「エレナ」と「リボン」の能力も成長します。<br/>レベルアップと世界中に散った道具の収集によって、「エレナ」と「リボン」が新しいスキルと能力を覚えます。<br/>当然道具を収集しなくでも大丈夫です。収集しなくでもクリアできます。</span><br/></p>Rabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer, that mean it is focus on non-linear gameplay. There will always be hints of where to go,but player never required to follow them, as most of the game can be completed in any order.<p></p>Player will play as the bunny protagonist, Erina., whose attacks are focus on close combat attack while Ribbon, the fairy, is the range attacker, she will follow Erina and indirectly controlled by player.<div>Erina is just a little rabbit that turned into a human, so don’t expect she can do anything super! And as the game keep processing, the area for exploring will be increase too.<br/>New attacks and  abilities of both Erina and Ribbon can be  learnt and improved  by   collecting items and upgrade which are spreaded in every corner of the game world.<br/>Any items in the game are optional to pick up, you can even try to beat  the game  in the hard way – without collecting any items!</div>
<div>Rabi-Ribi 是一款 2D 平台探險動作遊戲，意味著它是一款非固定路線的遊戲。劇情進行中會有提示玩家下一步該如何走，但玩家不必按照指示進行遊戲，遊戲可以按照玩家喜好順序去完成。</div>
<div>
<br/>玩家將可以控制使用近戰攻擊的兔耳娘主角，Erina 。以及間接控制使用遠距離攻擊的 Ribbon 妖精。<br/>
</div>
<div>Erina 只是一隻變成人類的普通兔子，所以不要以為她會做出什麼很強的東西啊！<br/>不過隨著遊戲的進行，可探索的區域也會隨之增加，Erina 和 Ribbon 的能力也會漸漸提昇。<br/>藉由收集和升級分布在世界角落的道具，Erina 和 Ribbon 可以學習新的攻擊和能力。<br/>
</div>
<div>另外，由於遊戲沒有固定路線，所有道具都可以跳過的，也就是可以在不收集任何道具的情況下破關。<br/>

<p><span>私たちはすべてのプレイヤーを完全なる「ラビリビ」を楽しんていただきたいと思います！<br/><br/>今「ラビリビ」の完成度は80％に着きましたが、まだまだ理想の完成度まで距離があります。<br/>私達は少しでも早く計画したサブクエスト、探索要素、成長装備、もっと多彩なゲーム体験ともっと豊富な戦闘内容を完成したいとおもいますので、どうかご支援のほど宜しくお願いいたします！</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>We hope that everyone would enjoy Rabi-Ribi as we do!</span></p>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>And we always want it to be better,but sadly it is impossible to be done with us alone.</p>
<p>We've got a huge amount of original soundtrack, art work, promotion videos, with a really long development time yet without any income, it's hard for us to keep it going.</p>
<p>that's why we need YOUR help.</p>
<p>Every single penny you've spent won't be wasted.</p>
<p>Here's the Budge Breakdown of how are we going to use these money.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope you can be a part of us!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>我們希望所有玩家都能享受完整的 Rabi-Ribi ！<br/>製作團隊也希望呈現最完美的遊戲給所有玩家！<br/>目前已經完成相當大量的原聲帶、美術圖集、宣傳影片，<br/>也燃燒了不少開發金，即便所有劇情主線、遊戲機制、Boss 戰鬥、<br/>華麗的彈幕、豐富龐大的養成要素…完成度幾乎達８０％，<br/><br/>距離作品完整仍還有段距離。<br/>若能護得更多開發金，將可以在更短的時間內完成原定企劃的數項支線任務、<br/>探索要素、更多的成長裝備、更完善的遊戲體驗與更豐富的戰鬥內容。<br/><br/>也希望大家在使用贊助功能時，優先考慮的是是否願意幫助我們順利開發，<br/>而非考量贊助的額外Bouns（當然這是一種回饋！但並非募資的本體）。<br/><br/>期待各位的參與！一起完成 Rabi - Ribi ！<p></p>

ウサ耳娘を主人公にするゲームが欲しい、このゲームはそういうあなたに捧げますーーーーー2D横スクロールアクション　+　探索ゲーム
主人公「エリナ」は平和な日常を送る極普通のウサギです。ある日突然、彼女は見知らず土地で現れて、しかも人間になりました！目的のない旅の中、彼女は明るい可憐な妖精「リボン」と出会いました。
これで、二人の家を帰る旅が始まった。多分黒幕が探し出せますかな？ 

There is always not enough games with a bunny girl as the protagonist. So here is another one for all the bunny lovers — A 2D sidescrolling plus exploration platformer.
Erina, the protagonist ,was a normal rabbit that lived in a peaceful life …That was until one day, she found herself in an unknown place and noticed her apperance turned into a human.
During her aimless wandering , she meet the cheerful pink haired fairy – Ribbon, who, for some reason, want to stick with Erina.
Therefore, without any choices, an adventure of a bunny and a fairy searching for the way to home has started. And perhaps even finding out who is the reason of causing all of this trouble as well?
讓兔耳娘當主角的遊戲總是不嫌多，所以這是款獻給兔耳愛好者的遊戲 — 一款 2D 橫向捲軸 + 平台探險動作遊戲。遊戲的主角，Erina，是一隻生活在寧靜生活的普通兔子… 直到那天，她發現她身在未知的地方且變成了人類。 經歷了沒有目的的流浪後，她遇見一隻活潑的粉髮妖精 – Ribbon，因為一些原因她決定跟隨 Erina。 在沒有選擇的情況下。一隻兔子和一隻妖精踏上了尋找家園的冒險。也許會找出這一切都是誰在搞鬼的說？




「ラビリビ」は2D探索横スクロールアクションゲーム、要するに固定のルートはありません。ゲーム中、次のエピソードへ行くヒントは与えますが、プレイヤー達はヒントを従う必要がありません。自分の想いでゲームの進行を調整できます。プレイヤー達は近接攻撃を使ううさ耳娘「エリナ」と遠距離攻撃を使う妖精「リボン」を使えます「エリナ」は普通のウサギから変化した人間ですので、強いパワーを持つとか期待しないてくださいね！ですがゲームの進行と伴う、探索可能の領域が広くなり、「エレナ」と「リボン」の能力も成長します。レベルアップと世界中に散った道具の収集によって、「エレナ」と「リボン」が新しいスキルと能力を覚えます。当然道具を収集しなくでも大丈夫です。収集しなくでもクリアできます。Rabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer, that mean it is focus on non-linear gameplay. There will always be hints of where to go,but player never required to follow them, as most of the game can be completed in any order.Player will play as the bunny protagonist, Erina., whose attacks are focus on close combat attack while Ribbon, the fairy, is the range attacker, she will follow Erina and indirectly controlled by player.Erina is just a little rabbit that turned into a human, so don’t expect she can do anything super! And as the game keep processing, the area for exploring will be increase too.New attacks and  abilities of both Erina and Ribbon can be  learnt and improved  by   collecting items and upgrade which are spreaded in every corner of the game world.Any items in the game are optional to pick up, you can even try to beat  the game  in the hard way – without collecting any items!
Rabi-Ribi 是一款 2D 平台探險動作遊戲，意味著它是一款非固定路線的遊戲。劇情進行中會有提示玩家下一步該如何走，但玩家不必按照指示進行遊戲，遊戲可以按照玩家喜好順序去完成。

玩家將可以控制使用近戰攻擊的兔耳娘主角，Erina 。以及間接控制使用遠距離攻擊的 Ribbon 妖精。

Erina 只是一隻變成人類的普通兔子，所以不要以為她會做出什麼很強的東西啊！不過隨著遊戲的進行，可探索的區域也會隨之增加，Erina 和 Ribbon 的能力也會漸漸提昇。藉由收集和升級分布在世界角落的道具，Erina 和 Ribbon 可以學習新的攻擊和能力。

另外，由於遊戲沒有固定路線，所有道具都可以跳過的，也就是可以在不收集任何道具的情況下破關。

「Kano-Bi」はインディーゲーム開発チーム！メンバーは香港と台湾から集まりました。ゲームのグラフィクは古めの8bitの感覚、かわいい画風と綺麗な弾幕で制作しました。「Kano-Bi」のプロデューサー、メインプログラマーとメインデザイナー：Gema Yue 八年以上にゲーム関係の仕事をやりました。「Magic Broom Shooting」と「Wizardry Magicization」のプログラム、グラフィックとステージデザインを全部一人でやりましたので、相当なファンを集めました。

We're Kano-Bi!Kano-Bi is a Indie Game Team, our team members based on Hong Kong and Taiwan, we make games that combine Retro and Modern style.
The hoster of Kano-Bi: Gema Yue, is a Programmer and Illustrator. Yue started writing Game Plugins and making games for 8 years, previous games like ""Magic Broom Shooting"" and ""Wizardry Magicization"" are made by Gema Yue himself solely ,including Programming, Graphics and Level Design, which gathared a huge number of fans for Kano-Bi.

Kano-Bi 是獨立遊戲製作團隊！成員來自香港與台灣，遊戲風格融合了復古的 8 - bit 風格、日系畫風、絢麗的彈幕特效！
Kano-Bi 的企劃主催、兼主程式、主美術：Gema Yue，從事遊戲相關差件、製作已經有八年的經驗了。之前的作品有「Magic Broom Shooting」、「Wizardry Magicization」之程式撰寫、美術繪製、關卡設計，皆為 Gema Yue 一手包辦。因此 Kano-Bi 吸引了相當大量的粉絲











私たちはすべてのプレイヤーを完全なる「ラビリビ」を楽しんていただきたいと思います！今「ラビリビ」の完成度は80％に着きましたが、まだまだ理想の完成度まで距離があります。私達は少しでも早く計画したサブクエスト、探索要素、成長装備、もっと多彩なゲーム体験ともっと豊富な戦闘内容を完成したいとおもいますので、どうかご支援のほど宜しくお願いいたします！

We hope that everyone would enjoy Rabi-Ribi as we do!


And we always want it to be better,but sadly it is impossible to be done with us alone.
We've got a huge amount of original soundtrack, art work, promotion videos, with a really long development time yet without any income, it's hard for us to keep it going.
that's why we need YOUR help.
Every single penny you've spent won't be wasted.
Here's the Budge Breakdown of how are we going to use these money.
We sincerely hope you can be a part of us!

我們希望所有玩家都能享受完整的 Rabi-Ribi ！製作團隊也希望呈現最完美的遊戲給所有玩家！目前已經完成相當大量的原聲帶、美術圖集、宣傳影片，也燃燒了不少開發金，即便所有劇情主線、遊戲機制、Boss 戰鬥、華麗的彈幕、豐富龐大的養成要素…完成度幾乎達８０％，距離作品完整仍還有段距離。若能護得更多開發金，將可以在更短的時間內完成原定企劃的數項支線任務、探索要素、更多的成長裝備、更完善的遊戲體驗與更豐富的戰鬥內容。也希望大家在使用贊助功能時，優先考慮的是是否願意幫助我們順利開發，而非考量贊助的額外Bouns（當然這是一種回饋！但並非募資的本體）。期待各位的參與！一起完成 Rabi - Ribi ！

</div></div>","Be a part of the Musana Carts movement!We are bringing innovative technology and opportunities for 10 million street vendors in crowded urban areas. We met Kizza, a hard working father of two, selling the most popular street food in Kampala: egg rolls. Musana Carts enables micro-entrepreneurs like Kizza to better provide for their families. Everyday Kizza sells 200 egg rolls, but takes home just $7. If he could increase his capacity, that number would go up.
Pimp Kizza’s Cart!Kizza is up against a lot: poor energy infrastructure, the risks associated with operating illegally and inhaling dangerous fumes from his coal burning stove. We immersed ourselves in Kizza’s reality, and we developed his solution: the Musana Carts.
We brought this solution to the Hult Prize, the world’s largest start up accelerator. With 25,000 applicants from all over the world, we were thrilled to make it through the first two of three rounds. Now, we are amongst the final 6 teams to compete at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting in New York this coming September, where former President Bill Clinton will award the USD 1,000,000 Prize to the winning team.


Musana Carts are street vending carts which provide Kizza with solar energy on the go.


Musana Carts are modular, made for customization of business features including fridges, sockets and mobile money terminals. Beyond its features, Musana Carts equips its vendors with finance and business training and offers a path to legalization for those trapped in the informal sector.
There are 10,000 street vendors just like Kizza in Kampala today. Make a change in their lives with a donation to Musana Carts. Together we can start the Solar Street Vending Revolution!
Every dollar can make a difference
We met with Kizza and many others vendors during our field research in Uganda. We listened to their challenges and we built Musana Carts as the solution to help push them out of poverty and revolutionize their street vending enterprises. We want to design an easy to use cart equipped with the best features on the market that is completely self sustaining through the use of solar panels. 




By donating to our project, you will allow us to come back to Kampala and fulfill our promise made to our inspiration: the entrepreneurs in the streets 
“I’m working every night to pay my fees for University. I understood that life is a challenge, you cannot wake up in the morning and wait for a mango falling from the tree, you have to sweat and use your energy, to get what you want, it's the only way""
-Tom, 20 years, Chicken vendor, Wandegeya Market, Kampala, Uganda
“I’m working only in the morning, and my husband doesn’t work, still I succeed to feed my whole family, but I struggle, sometimes I’m waiting all the day for customers, I would like to have a way to reach them instead of sitting and waiting. ”
-Jocelyn, 26 years, Porridge vendor, pregnant, and mother of a 2yr old girl, Nakawa Market, Kampala, Uganda
“My main expense is to rent the fridge from the owner, I wish I could own one myself but I don’t have the capital to invest, it’s my only option”
-Aisha, 30 years old, Soda vendor, Nakasero Market, Kampala, Uganda

Musana Carts Impact


Financial impact: Each cart empowers vendors to reduce energy costs and save time, creating additional working hours to sell more products and increase their revenues.


Economic impact for the city of Kampala: Vendors will transition from the informal economy to become legal tax paying entrepreneurs. 
Environmental impact: Each cart saves 300 tons of carbon emissions every year!
Health impact: The elimination of smoke from cooking reduces charcoal smoke inhalation related diseases!
Energy impact: Musana Carts improves the access to electricity for all the workers within the markets.
Social impact: Musana Carts give access to business training and allow each vendor to invest in his/her livelihood leading to upward social mobility through entrepreneurship!

<h3><b>WHAT IS A FANCHISE?</b></h3>
<p>fan·chise  /ˈfanˌCHīz/</p>
<p>noun</p>
<p>a professional sports team that provides its fans unparalleled 
control of, and access to, their sports entertainment experience; 
especially: the right to exercise the powers of a General Manager and 
Coach.</p>
<h3><b>IS THIS A REAL TEAM IN A REAL LEAGUE?</b></h3>
<p>YES! This is a real team in the Indoor Football League (IFL). You 
remember a guy by the name of Kurt Warner? This is the same league his 
team, the Iowa Barnstormers, is in. Think about it…one of the greatest 
QBs in NFL history played on a team in this league. That’s as real as it
 gets.</p>
<h3><b>ARE ANY OF THE OTHER TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE RUN BY THE FANS?</b></h3>
<p>NO. The Project FANchise team is the first fan-run professional team 
in the history of sports. So when we say join us and make history, we 
mean it. This is uncharted territory for everyone involved.</p>
<h3><b>WHAT DO I GET TO VOTE ON?</b></h3>
<p>The short answer… everything. You will choose the GM and coaching 
staff. You will scout and evaluate players and decide who makes the 
roster. You will choose the team name and team colors. You will design 
the logo and mascot. And best of all, you will call all the plays in 
real time! We really mean it, this is your team.</p>
<h3><b>WILL MY VOTE ACTUALLY COUNT?</b></h3>
<p>Absolutely. Everyone’s vote will count. We are building an app that 
will allow you to prove (and improve) your football knowledge. Everyone 
will start out as a rookie with the same influence on the team. As you 
increase your FanIQ (football knowledge) your voting power will 
increase.</p>
<h3>WHO ARE YOU GUYS? CAN I TRUST YOU?</h3>
<p>We are a group of former NFL players and front office vets, 
successful technology entrepreneurs, and investors that all believe fans
 deserve more than a “thank you” during a press conference. Feel free to
 contact any of us if you have questions. We could not be more excited 
to be doing this, and we thank you for helping us make it a reality!</p>
<h3><b>IS THIS A FOOTBALL TEAM OR A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY?</b></h3>
<p>BOTH! Project FANchise is actually two separate, distinct companies. 
The first, Project FANchise Technology, is focused on building a mobile 
technology platform to allow fans to run a real football team. The 
second, Project FANchise Team, is focused on building a world-class 
football organization that will look exactly like other IFL and even NFL
 organizations except that fans (like you!) will be making all the 
important decisions, while the people in the front office and on the 
field go out and execute exactly what the fans want.</p>
<h3>WHY SHOULD I BACK THIS CAMPAIGN?</h3>
<p>You mean aside from the fact that it's the greatest thing that's ever
 happened to sports? The fans that join now will be rewarded with more 
influence (voting power) on all team decisions. Everyone’s vote will 
count, but voting power will be based on a number of factors including 
how much you participate, your football knowledge, and the length of 
time you’ve been involved. The fans that join early and spend the time 
to help build and shape the team will be the leaders of a new type of 
fan…fans whose voice actually counts. #PowerToTheFANS</p>
<h3><b>I WANT TO PLAY ON THE TEAM. HOW CAN I TRY OUT?</b></h3>
<b>
</b><p>Back this campaign to secure yourself a tryout plus get early access 
to the app so you can vote for yourself to make the team. We will be 
holding a minimum of four tryouts across the country so unless you are 
from Finland there will be one close enough for you to drive.  Just 
remember the fans are going to be making the final decision on every 
roster spot, so your personality off the field is going to be just as 
important as your skills on it.</p>

<p>""What does that even mean?"" you ask. ""And who ARE you?"" Alright, alright, hold your equines.</p>
<p>My name's Ashton Sperry, founder and contributor for <a href=""http://paizo.com/store/byCompany/p/pathfinderPaperMinis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pathfinder Paper Minis</a>, the paper miniatures line licensed by <a href=""http://paizo.com/paizo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paizo Publishing</a>, creators of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. I also run a little <a href=""http://whodrewthis.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DeviantART page</a> under the alias WhoDrewThis that some folks may know me better for. As for the WhoDrewThis Mega Minisplosion? Well, that would be a compilation miniatures pack of a whole lotta art from my DeviantART page and unfinished home projects, converted into paper minis and arranged into one big miniature set. We're talking some 160+ minis- at least- and that's not even including the commissions available as Perks. This will be one big, big, BIG minis set, and it's only available here as part of this Indiegogo project.</p>
<p>So, I mentioned the commissions, yes? Each Perk above the first one will net you at least one commissioned mini of your choice. That's right: anything you want drawn and turned into a mini is yours. Your character and his or her buddies, their main villain, a mechanical turtle, an anthropomorphic ham sandwich- basically anything you want. Each additional person signing up for a Perk helps expand the set for everyone, so it's not a bad idea to get your friends in on the action.</p>
<p>In addition, at higher Perks, I'll start taking names for input regarding my long-awaited minis biz, Astounding Minis, designed for you and your fellow gamers to fit the odd niches in gaming we all love. Lovecraftian horror? I can do that. Post-apocalyptic wasteland? Yup. Victorian steampunk? Why but of course. Even something as generic as ""Orcs and Dwarves"" could become a set if there's that much interest for it. And that's what I need- to know what people want from Astounding Minis, so I can provide top-notch paper miniatures sure to get use on your gaming table.</p>
<p>So browse the Perks, find the one that's right for you, and spread the word. Together we can make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> We're funded! And as we all know, that means...</p>
<h2><strong>STREEETCH GOALS</strong></h2>
<p>I'll be setting up a fun little graphic for these once the new computer arrives. But for now, here's a simple list:</p>
<p><strong>$1,000:</strong> EVERY Perk will receive, in addition to the goodies they already get, a FREE PDF of the first Astounding Minis set- estimated release date February 2013.</p>
<p><strong>$1,500:</strong> PERSONALLY SIGNED copies of the Minisplosion cover, mailed to your address, for EVERY Perk! Want me to write you a love letter? Or hate mail? Or draw a mustache with glasses? Just ask and it's yours on your professionally printed 8.5"" x 11"" cover copy.</p>

<h2>Concept:</h2>
<p><strong>Combat between 10-20 contestants is live streamed over the internet via cameras and head-mounted displays on each person. Anyone can watch and influence the arena via a website. Viewers can sponsor players or pay to use ultimate gamemaker abilities. </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise money and publicty for the creation of a ""<strong>Hunger Games</strong>"" style <strong>live-streamed</strong> battle royale. Viewers act as gamemakers via online actions and manipulate the real-world environment, complete with <strong>actual people</strong> in competition. </p>
<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>10-20 players will fight to the last man standing in a <strong>live elimination tournament</strong>. Gameplay in early stages could be tested with paintball weapons, capture objectives, or other already established means. Hopefully this campaign will encourage innovation in hybrid gaming.</p>
<p>Players attempt to eliminate eachother until the last man standing. This player will recieve a prize.</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewers online will have the option of sponsoring a player... i.e. ""joining their district""</li>
<li>Viewers will wager <strong>gamemaker influence</strong>, a currency used to wield gamemaker abilities on the arena, when selecting a player. If your tribute wins, you will recieve bonus points.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<br/><strong>The Show</strong>
</h2>
<p>Users will view the arena on an <strong>interactive website</strong>. The tournament could be monthly or annual to encourage a truly awesome arena to be designed. Users could swap between the main show video, indiviudal player feeds from <strong>head mounted displays</strong>, or arena cameras. </p>
<p>Users could also access game stats, an arena map with real-time player locations, and a <strong>Gamemaker panel</strong>. Players could spend <strong>gamemaker influence</strong> access special abilities to use on the arena. </p>
<p>During the games, at various points viewers will be <strong>prompted to make choices</strong> that will influence the real arena. The crowdsource element will make audience participation a revolutionary experience and have real-world <strong>environmental effects</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong><br/>Engage a trap<br/>Set off an explotion<br/>""Heal"" a player<br/>Affect the arena layout<br/>Create a trap<br/>Send player supplies</p>
<p>After the games a <strong>highlights video</strong> would be compiled and available for all.</p>
<h2>Business Model</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>subscriptions: </strong>each game could be pay-pay-view for a small fee. Just like in ""The Condemned""</li>
<li>
<strong>advertising:</strong> this would generate a ton of internet publicity. ads could be sold on the show or website. A hunger games style event marketed  well could have millions of viewers.</li>
<li>

<h2><img alt=""About the project"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.montaguesmount.com/images/indiegogo/AboutThisProject.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""About this project""/></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em><strong>""One desolate landscape... one solitary fisherman... and an island hiding memories around every turn"" - Montague's Mount.</strong></em></p>
<p><span>Montague's Mount is a first person psychological rollercoaster ride through isolation, desolation and one man's tortured mind; all set against the bleakness of an isolated Irish island.</span></p>
<p><span>It was born out of a love of both video games and cinema. Long before I ever sat down to create my first video game (approximately 20 years ago), I could been seen waving a camera at just about anything. Over the years, certain movies have captured my imagination, namely; ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest""; Kubrick's ""The Shinning""; ""The Blair Witch Project""; and more recently, Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"". All these films have a common thread of isolation, desolation and touch upon some shocking issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Current trends within the gaming world have left the market awash with Horror'esque games; most of which revolve around 'Shock or Buckets of Blood' tactics to get their message across. My goal with Montague's Mount is to redefine the Horror genre, giving the gamer a combination of clever puzzles, a thought-provoking story that touches upon real issues (such as mental health), and stays true to my love of cinematic visuals.</span></p>
<p><span>As the game is set on an island off Ireland, we are going to embrace 'all things Irish' as much as we can, including the Irish language (Gaeilge). We believe Montague's Mount will be the first ever mainstream game to use the Irish language (don't worry, English subtitles/options will be available, as will other languages).</span></p>
<p><span><img alt=""bent image"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.montaguesmount.com/images/indiegogo/photo01_bend.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Montagues Mount Beach Area""/></span></p>

<p><img alt=""what has been achieved"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.montaguesmount.com/images/indiegogo/WhatHasBeenAchieved.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""What has been achieved to date""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><em>“It felt like this was never going to end. The world wasn't going to stop crashing down until there was nothing left of me but dust.”</em> - Keary Taylor</strong></p>
<p>The story is pretty much water tight. We know where I am going with the lead character and the environment. Creating a new back-story, which would hold up well against the location and the realities of mental illness wasn't easy and it has been a long, and at times soul searching, experience.</p>
<p>The island locations for the initial episode have been mapped out, with the initial prologue section being fully realised with the game engine; including all the puzzle elements being mapped out.</p>
<p>A Steam Greenlight submission has been made for Episode 1 and this is going extremely favourably.</p>
<p>Episode 1 is approximately 75% complete and I am hopeful, if this indiegogo campaign is successful, that a Christmas 2012 release is more than possible.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><em>""For too long we have swept the problems of mental illness under the carpet... and hoped that they would go away""</em> - Richard J. Codey</strong></p>
<p>In a word, ""Dedication"". I have a real passion for Montague's Mount. For the last 12 months I have developed and worked single handedly on what you see, spending thousands of hours modelling, coding, designing and writing. Apart from a few models and the music from the video, everything has been made with my hands - and I have enjoyed every second of it (much to my wife's dismay - she says I am constantly in the office).</p>
<p>Having worked within the IT and games industry for 20 years I am no stranger to game development and personally have all the skillsets required to deliver this game. Up until now, having the ability and the passion to complete this, combined with a 'day job' to pay the bills, has been fantastic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, life has changed. The economic decline which has hit Ireland has left me being made redundant and now my goals for Montague's Mount far exceed my resources.</p>
<p>That is why I am asking for your help to help me complete Montague's Mount. To give me the necessary resources to finish it and to finish it to the highest level possible.</p>
<p><img alt=""Montagues Mount Bridge"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.montaguesmount.com/images/indiegogo/photo02_bend.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Montagues Mount Bridge""/></p>
<p><img alt=""How Can You Help"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.montaguesmount.com/images/indiegogo/HowCanYouHelp.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""How Can You Help""/></p>
<p>First and foremost by pledging to this campaign. Your contributions are what will keep this project afloat. Without your help this project cannot go much further and I fear Montague's Mount will founder... which would be a tragedy. Something full of so much passion, and time spent upon it, cannot be allowed to go this way.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><em>""This is all so familiar; I have been this way before. It was Peter and Aine who brought me this way. If only this unrelenting rain would give in, I could say for sure. Day after day, this perpetual dampness, crawling all over me, saturating everything on this island"" </em>- Montague's Mount</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contributions Level 1 - $15,000</strong></p>
<p>If we can get to a contributions level of $15,000 that would be amazing. This amount would give me the necessary resource to complete Montague's Mount. It would allow for a simultaneous release on PC, Mac and Linux devices. As you can see from what has been accomplished so far, Montague's Mount will end up being a fantastic final game and with this level of support, allow me to fulfill this.</p>
<p><strong>Contributions Level 2 - $20,000</strong></p>
<p>If, with your help, we can get to Level 2 that would be truly fantastic. The additional contributions would allow me to try far more advanced things with Montague’s Mount. It would allow for some outsourcing of asset creation, which in turn would allow me additional time to polish the product to a much higher level. New shaders could be written to replace the current water system and additional eye candy could be added. When I started this project, one of my goals was to make the most realistic and 'living' environment of any game before made. With this level of support, this goal could be realised.</p>
<p><strong>Contributions Level 3 - $25,000</strong></p>
<p>If, we could get to Level 3, well that would be amazing! This amount would allow for all the I's to be dotted and the T's to be crossed.</p>
<p>It would allow us to cement a mobile device release and look at other platforms. It allow for mobile devices to be purchased to test Montague’s Mount for deployment onto these platforms.

""One desolate landscape... one solitary fisherman... and an island hiding memories around every turn"" - Montague's Mount.
Montague's Mount is a first person psychological rollercoaster ride through isolation, desolation and one man's tortured mind; all set against the bleakness of an isolated Irish island.
It was born out of a love of both video games and cinema. Long before I ever sat down to create my first video game (approximately 20 years ago), I could been seen waving a camera at just about anything. Over the years, certain movies have captured my imagination, namely; ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest""; Kubrick's ""The Shinning""; ""The Blair Witch Project""; and more recently, Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"". All these films have a common thread of isolation, desolation and touch upon some shocking issues.
Current trends within the gaming world have left the market awash with Horror'esque games; most of which revolve around 'Shock or Buckets of Blood' tactics to get their message across. My goal with Montague's Mount is to redefine the Horror genre, giving the gamer a combination of clever puzzles, a thought-provoking story that touches upon real issues (such as mental health), and stays true to my love of cinematic visuals.
As the game is set on an island off Ireland, we are going to embrace 'all things Irish' as much as we can, including the Irish language (Gaeilge). We believe Montague's Mount will be the first ever mainstream game to use the Irish language (don't worry, English subtitles/options will be available, as will other languages).

 

“It felt like this was never going to end. The world wasn't going to stop crashing down until there was nothing left of me but dust.” - Keary Taylor
The story is pretty much water tight. We know where I am going with the lead character and the environment. Creating a new back-story, which would hold up well against the location and the realities of mental illness wasn't easy and it has been a long, and at times soul searching, experience.
The island locations for the initial episode have been mapped out, with the initial prologue section being fully realised with the game engine; including all the puzzle elements being mapped out.
A Steam Greenlight submission has been made for Episode 1 and this is going extremely favourably.
Episode 1 is approximately 75% complete and I am hopeful, if this indiegogo campaign is successful, that a Christmas 2012 release is more than possible.

""For too long we have swept the problems of mental illness under the carpet... and hoped that they would go away"" - Richard J. Codey
In a word, ""Dedication"". I have a real passion for Montague's Mount. For the last 12 months I have developed and worked single handedly on what you see, spending thousands of hours modelling, coding, designing and writing. Apart from a few models and the music from the video, everything has been made with my hands - and I have enjoyed every second of it (much to my wife's dismay - she says I am constantly in the office).
Having worked within the IT and games industry for 20 years I am no stranger to game development and personally have all the skillsets required to deliver this game. Up until now, having the ability and the passion to complete this, combined with a 'day job' to pay the bills, has been fantastic.
Unfortunately, life has changed. The economic decline which has hit Ireland has left me being made redundant and now my goals for Montague's Mount far exceed my resources.
That is why I am asking for your help to help me complete Montague's Mount. To give me the necessary resources to finish it and to finish it to the highest level possible.


First and foremost by pledging to this campaign. Your contributions are what will keep this project afloat. Without your help this project cannot go much further and I fear Montague's Mount will founder... which would be a tragedy. Something full of so much passion, and time spent upon it, cannot be allowed to go this way.
""This is all so familiar; I have been this way before. It was Peter and Aine who brought me this way. If only this unrelenting rain would give in, I could say for sure. Day after day, this perpetual dampness, crawling all over me, saturating everything on this island"" - Montague's Mount
Contributions Level 1 - $15,000
If we can get to a contributions level of $15,000 that would be amazing. This amount would give me the necessary resource to complete Montague's Mount. It would allow for a simultaneous release on PC, Mac and Linux devices. As you can see from what has been accomplished so far, Montague's Mount will end up being a fantastic final game and with this level of support, allow me to fulfill this.
Contributions Level 2 - $20,000
If, with your help, we can get to Level 2 that would be truly fantastic. The additional contributions would allow me to try far more advanced things with Montague’s Mount. It would allow for some outsourcing of asset creation, which in turn would allow me additional time to polish the product to a much higher level. New shaders could be written to replace the current water system and additional eye candy could be added. When I started this project, one of my goals was to make the most realistic and 'living' environment of any game before made. With this level of support, this goal could be realised.
Contributions Level 3 - $25,000
If, we could get to Level 3, well that would be amazing! This amount would allow for all the I's to be dotted and the T's to be crossed.
It would allow us to cement a mobile device release and look at other platforms. It allow for mobile devices to be purchased to test Montague’s Mount for deployment onto these platforms. With all the detail currently in the Montague’s Mount environment, getting it to run on a mobile device will not be easy. Quite a bit of reworking will be needed to get it running smoothly. That said, one of my goals is to see this running on a tablet. The iPad, for instance, would make a perfect partner for Montague’s Mount.
It will allow us to start researching new input devices, such as the Oculus Rift VR headset and new platforms such as OUYA.
Contributions Level 4 - $30,000+
This is the ideal solution, which would let me add all the bells and whistles to the project, and make Montague’s Mount the game is really should be. It would allow for additional help. More time to be spent polishing everything to the highest level possible. It will allow for additional time allocated for marketing and promotion.
It will also give us the time and resources to implement the Oculus Rift VR headset into Montague's Mount. The Oculus Rift Virtual Reality headset is something that I must get implemented into Montague’s Mount. It is cutting edge technology and would add and additional level of realism and immersion that would be mind blowing.
It would make Montague's Mount become one of the first supporters of the Oculus Rift and be a huge selling factor for the project.

Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for taking the time to read this campaign.
Like I said, I know money is tight; we all have bills to pay on a daily basis. I understand fully if contributing financially to this campaign is out of the question.
Could I ask that, whether you can afford to contribute or not, you tell as many people as you can about this project. If you are a Twitter or Facebook user, please spend a minute and post a few words about it and ask others to do the same.

</div>
<div>
<b>Free mode </b>is for people who want only to relax, do just ordinary things and nothing more. Just to have opportunity to spend 30 minutes away from reality and don't get stressed. You can arrange things around your pond as you wish, go fishing, grill some meat, make camp fires, set furniture as you like and more. You will have possibility to take care about fish, feed them, see them grow. But mostly, you will do <b>just ordinary, but relaxing things.</b>
</div>
<div>
<b>Good thing about free mode is game mechanics. </b>For example - if you go fishing and catch a fish, you'll need to store it afterwards in fridge. Fridge has its own capacity and power consumption. So you need to provide power to it from some power generator, like photovoltaic panels or petrol generator. Petrol generator needs petrol for running, so you need to buy it (don't be afraid, the game will be <b>microtransaction-free</b>). </div>
<div>All of those things will be configurable for the game, so you may be able to play in free mode without having to care about power, storage, etc and just enjoy and explore the environment.</div>

  I am very happy to have your attention. If you would not like to contribute to this project right now, I will understand it as this project has nothing to show currently in comparison with others.

  Nevertheless I found some courage to ask you for funding of my project... so let me tell you about it.
  It is not going to be AAA game, but fair and enjoyable indie game. (Well, in case, I would earn enough funds, it can be AAA game, but let's be realistic here. :-) )

What is it about?

This game project is successor of original idea, which was making first person relaxation game taking place in middle-european rural area. 
Now, I am working on project, which has two game modes:


Story/horror mode
Free mode


Story mode is on the other hand for players, who want to experience something fearful. This is not another zombie, or survival game. This game should make you fear and uncomfortable. 
As a man with mental illness (or I should say illnesses) you are sent to your brother-in-law's shed near the pond to continue your treatment. Your problems are getting better after few years of therapy, so your psychiatrist gave you some directions, what to do in case of emergency, some medication and ordered you to relax there alone. But the doctor didn't know that the place holds secrets and memories, which your mind suppressed. It's up to you if you will take your medication or not. If you solve your problems somehow else. You are not going to fight as this is not FPS, but you are going to explore yourself and your limits. 
I am so sorry, that I cannot tell you more right now about story (same pays for some game mechanics), it would spoil the experience offered by game.But I can assure you, that it will make you think a bit differently and challenge your nerves. Game is not about fighting, but about making decisions, exploring how things works and exploring the dangerous world.




Free mode is for people who want only to relax, do just ordinary things and nothing more. Just to have opportunity to spend 30 minutes away from reality and don't get stressed. You can arrange things around your pond as you wish, go fishing, grill some meat, make camp fires, set furniture as you like and more. You will have possibility to take care about fish, feed them, see them grow. But mostly, you will do just ordinary, but relaxing things.


Good thing about free mode is game mechanics. For example - if you go fishing and catch a fish, you'll need to store it afterwards in fridge. Fridge has its own capacity and power consumption.

All of those things will be configurable for the game, so you may be able to play in free mode without having to care about power, storage, etc and just enjoy and explore the environment.
I will reveal more from story and other information, like game mechanics, via updates. 
More information about game
The game will offer following languages as standard:


English
Czech
German

Other languages will be available depending on level of funding, if goal is met, then Spanish and French language will be available.

For the relaxing content: I will deploy application on game website, which enables owners of the game to vote for new game mechanic, asset or whatever you can imagine to be implemented in the game next. So the game will be evolving continually without any DLCs or anything else. Owners of the game will get 1 vote per month, more can be bought. 

For the story mode: In case, the game will be successful, there will be additional story created without any fee for it.
Game will be available with story mode and without it for half of its price.
Lifespan of development of the game and support is planned to be for two years.

What would I need?

If you would contribute, I would use that funds to:



get better graphical assets
get some of the scripts 
get Unity engine Pro non-perpetual licence
get sound assets
proof reading of english texts and translations to other languages
establishing game website

For graphical assets I would mix my contribution, existing assets and digital artist's work. For sound assets I am planning to get them in sound bank or record some of them by myself.

Development of code will be done completely by me.
When is it done?
If I raise funds, I will do my best to finish it in Winter 2015/2016 (meaning December 2015 to February 2016).
I will provide you with regular updates through game website.
There are NOT going to be any public alfa testing, or early access of story mode. For free mode it will depend on situation, but it is rather possible.
What are funding goals?
The final target of 11000USD is distributed by following.




At 3500USD workflow and visuals will be improved significantly. Further donations will be invested into sound, languages and even better visuals (3D artist, 3D prefabs, animations).



Is it going to be finished?

<p>Although we had a clear vision of what we wanted to create, in 2001 some of the technology was still in it's infancy (such as virtual reality technology) - however, now we feel that the technology has progressed to a stage that our campaign would make a unique and enjoyable environment, which would benefit the local community, as well as the gaming community.</p>
<p>The vision that we have, is to build a very limited number of gaming centers throughout the world, which will include technology such as:</p>

<p>However, we do not want to create just another ordinary gaming center.  In addition to creating a unique gaming environment, we also aim to team up with local universities who offer gaming software development courses, to give them the opportunity to share the gaming center.  We will also create a think tank network and education facility, where gamer's can work together on creating new projects, whether it be new games or new gaming technology, so that their ideas and input can be shared with the gaming industry.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

everybody and welcome to the webpage of my campaign!</span></h4><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My
name is Emil, I’m 30. I’m living and working in Hungary in Budapest. I have
been fond of video games as long as I remember myself. The story started in the
beginning of nineties when my parents gave me for the birthday present a game
console Nintendo Intertaiment Systems (NES). Naturally even
prior to that I had some experience in gaming world, playing on Atari computers
famous hits such as Pitfall, Preliminary Monty, River Raid and
etc. But getting to know NES has simply turned my vision of games upside down.
I got so excited about gaming that until today I have bought practically any
released device on which one can play anything. However it was never sufficient
for me just to play as I always wanted to contribute something to the gaming
industry. I dreamt about creating a gaming development company of my own. Today
my dream has turned into an aim and that is why I’m here.</span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><div>
<img alt=""About"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bytherulesgame.com/campaign/images/about.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p><br/></p>
<p>The
game By the Rules will tell you a short story about a young guy which just have
received his driving license and is now going to have a fun ride on the streets
of different cities. It will be a so-called casual game, where a player needs
to distribute approriate road signs on the way to help the caracter get to the
point. Initially the game will be developed for mobile devices running iOS.
However later on, in case the project becomes successful, the game will also be
exported to devices running Android as well.</p>
<p>This
idea came to my mind completely spontaneously, when I told off one of my
colleagues for playing games on his mobile device instead of preparing for the
road code exam which he was scheduled to take shortly. That’s when I thought,
why actually not to help people combining a pleasure from playing game with an
opportunity to learn about road signs easily? Naturally, the video game will
not substitute for professional driving lessons, but you will probably agree,
that the child who learnt how to read before the school, will definitely feel
himself more comfortable in the class. In this case the result will be very
similar.</p>
<p>Creation
of this game will be a very special moment of my life, by launching this game
and by putting my utmost effort to make it popular, will enable me take pride
in providing people with meaningful entertainment. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><img alt=""I Need Your Help"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bytherulesgame.com/campaign/images/help.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I
have created everything what you can see in my campaign presentation by myself,
but unfortunately my knowledge isn’t sufficient to create this game completely
on my own, while also I would not like to seek assistance from people whose
knowledge is doubtable. That’s why I have found a team of professional developers
and have already discussed with them all conditions of the project and related
costs.</p>
<p>Below
you can see the list of items on which the money will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total game development: <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Graphics, animation, sounds, music
     etc. – 34000$</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Marketing
     campaign – 11000$</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Professional Website
     – 5000$</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Logo
     design – 2000$</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">IndieGoGo and Payment
     Processing fees – 4000$ </span></li>
</ul>
<p>In
my company I have chosen a flexible way of financing, which means that even if
I will fail to collect required amount with the current business plan, I will
still be able to launch the project on a lower budget by hiring less renowned
developers.</p>
<p>By
helping me to realize this project you are contributing to the development of
my company, but also to an educational benefit and fun of a very large
audience.</p>

</div></div>","Hi
everybody and welcome to the webpage of my campaign!My
name is Emil, I’m 30. I’m living and working in Hungary in Budapest. I have
been fond of video games as long as I remember myself. The story started in the
beginning of nineties when my parents gave me for the birthday present a game
console Nintendo Intertaiment Systems (NES). Naturally even
prior to that I had some experience in gaming world, playing on Atari computers
famous hits such as Pitfall, Preliminary Monty, River Raid and
etc. But getting to know NES has simply turned my vision of games upside down.
I got so excited about gaming that until today I have bought practically any
released device on which one can play anything. However it was never sufficient
for me just to play as I always wanted to contribute something to the gaming
industry. I dreamt about creating a gaming development company of my own. Today
my dream has turned into an aim and that is why I’m here.

The
game By the Rules will tell you a short story about a young guy which just have
received his driving license and is now going to have a fun ride on the streets
of different cities. It will be a so-called casual game, where a player needs
to distribute approriate road signs on the way to help the caracter get to the
point. Initially the game will be developed for mobile devices running iOS.
However later on, in case the project becomes successful, the game will also be
exported to devices running Android as well.
This
idea came to my mind completely spontaneously, when I told off one of my
colleagues for playing games on his mobile device instead of preparing for the
road code exam which he was scheduled to take shortly. That’s when I thought,
why actually not to help people combining a pleasure from playing game with an
opportunity to learn about road signs easily? Naturally, the video game will
not substitute for professional driving lessons, but you will probably agree,
that the child who learnt how to read before the school, will definitely feel
himself more comfortable in the class. In this case the result will be very
similar.
Creation
of this game will be a very special moment of my life, by launching this game
and by putting my utmost effort to make it popular, will enable me take pride
in providing people with meaningful entertainment. 




I
have created everything what you can see in my campaign presentation by myself,
but unfortunately my knowledge isn’t sufficient to create this game completely
on my own, while also I would not like to seek assistance from people whose
knowledge is doubtable. That’s why I have found a team of professional developers
and have already discussed with them all conditions of the project and related
costs.
Below
you can see the list of items on which the money will be spent:

Total game development: Graphics, animation, sounds, music
     etc. – 34000$

Marketing
     campaign – 11000$
Professional Website
     – 5000$
Logo
     design – 2000$
IndieGoGo and Payment
     Processing fees – 4000$ 

In
my company I have chosen a flexible way of financing, which means that even if
I will fail to collect required amount with the current business plan, I will
still be able to launch the project on a lower budget by hiring less renowned
developers.
By
helping me to realize this project you are contributing to the development of
my company, but also to an educational benefit and fun of a very large
audience.




This
is my first project, but I truly hope that not the last one. In case of
commercial success, names of people which helped me in the beginning will
forever remain an integral part of the brand By the Rules. I will be extremely
grateful to anyone contributing to the development of this project and will
reward you with different presents, a list of which you can check below.

</ul><p>This will first help with promos and trailers, but eventually for in-game cinematics as well.  $12,000 is a lot of money, but it more than pays for itself compared to what you’d spend getting a professional animator to do the same thing without it.  These kinds of technologies are a must-have for small teams that need to produce high quality animations and cinematics quickly.  </p><p>It’s quite amazing, but video game development technology has progressed to the point where ONE PERSON can make a game like Bright Memory in 1 year.  See for yourself:</p><div

technology stack as the developer of Bright Memory. </div><div> </div><p>This doesn’t mean if the campaign doesn’t get to $12,000 we’re closing down shop or giving up.  All the money we raise through crowdfunding, pre-orders, and regular investment is in addition to what we’ve already invested on our own money and will continue to invest.  </p><p>We are already on the path to make Key of David and we have no intention of stopping.  However, the additional support we receive in these early stages is critical in building momentum, creating brand awareness, and helping to cover setup costs.</p><p>This all helps us get to our goal faster.</p><h2>The Game:</h2><h2><img class=""lazy""

intended to be a story-driven action adventure shooter game.  Its main characters are four angels: Michael, Sophie, Gabriel, and Dinah.  These main characters find themselves at the center of events as the ""Day of the Lord"" (the apocalypse) unfolds.  The setting is present day for the most part, but there will be some retelling of critical biblical events, some millenial kingdom flash forwards, and some gameplay in what you might call “heaven” and “hell”.</p><p>The end times will be told from pre-millenialist perspective with no pre-tribulation rapture and a literal Two Witnesses.  We have considered the idea of having multiple storylines or endings based on differing prophetic interpretations if it works and time/budget permits.</p><p>Telling the story from the perspective of angels makes the storytelling a bit easier.  It's easier to fictionalize the events surrounding angels as opposed to “filling in the blanks” with more well-known bible characters.  Angels in the bible are common and at the same time mysterious, so they're easier to work with artistically.  We can fictionalize the story of our angels and use that as the thematic glue that ties together the more well-known characters and stories.  </p><p>Angels also serve as God's messengers and ""holy warriors"" so it gives the most leeway in terms of making a Christian story centered around

A lot of what we’ve learned is you need to market as early as possible and visuals (gifs, screenshots, short videos) are primary.  So we’re working very hard to get art and gameplay samples in front of our audience as fast as we can.  It’s challenging balancing the marketing with the game development, but not impossible.  Others have done it and succeeded.</p><h2>Risks</h2><p>The biggest risk is our game not meeting our expectations in terms of size and quality.  We’re confident that our game will be made, even if it’s significantly smaller than what we have planned.</p><p>We want to finance a game that has a lot of cinematics in order to bring our bible and apocalypse stories to life.  This means finding investors and likely publishers to help take the game into professional territory.  If our vision becomes a reality, this means a budget in the millions just based on the scale of cinematics alone.  </p><p>Our risk is that this doesn’t go as planned and instead we have a smaller game

<p><span>We’ve spent 11 long months creating our own proprietary 3D-isometric editor; a model and animations importer; a static, light-mapping, and shadow casting system; a 3D particle and billboards system; and we already have hundreds of tri-dimensional models between NPCs, props, architecture, and environment, plus our own propietary dialogue and scripting tool. We have almost all the technology into place to put our focus on developing content exclusively. This means we have now the time to work hard on the combat logic, the AI, adding and fleshing out the dialogues, side quests, and creating vast lands and secrets for you to explore and discover. We want to surprise you. We'll pay homage to the best CRPGs, but we also want to take the risk to do it our own way.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Dark Triad will allow you to chose among 5 different classes. The stats and skills system is being coded at the moment, and in the coming months it will need to be constantly adjusted and thouroughly tested to create a compelling combat system of gameplay. We want combat to pose a challenge and have a remarkable strategic component, even though you can always adjust its difficulty on-the-go to play in an easier or more difficult mode (though it will be always turn-based).</p>
<p>The stats and skills system has been made from scratch. You’ll find a really fresh and original mechanic blended with classic concepts, and this will hopefully cater to turn-based fans by providing some good fun and a challenge! We’ve already written 40% of the dialogues and lore, and the next step will be implementing and associating the dialogues with the characters' actions and choices, skills, stats, items, etc to add the maximum of of gameplay options.</p>
<p>We want you to feel that NPCs and characters are alive, that they have their own agendas, and that they remember what you told or did to them and act accordingly depending on their persona.</p>

<h2><strong>The Birth of the Isolated Lands: God and Races</strong></h2>
<div> </div>
<div>Since the dawn of time, humans have tried to answer essential questions of life: the purpose of death, struggle, and suffering.</div>
<div>Tales of gods who gave shape to the world as we know it have been passed down from generation to generation. The forces that set the world in  motion are attributed to the god Ageios, He set the world spinning around the sun to feed it with the star's sacred rays. The creation of diverse peoples, plants, and animals was the deed of the goddess Pleia. She possessed a kindly side that fostered humans, elves, dwarves, and haflings, but also a cruel one that created the or cs,  goblins, and the Dark Ones who would plunge the world into an agonizing war that would last millennia.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>In Search of the Truth: Denir the Wise</h2>
<p>The first humans never understood why the incarnated Evil, with all its horrid deeds, had to exist. Those first humans still remained pure, as their consciences were originally well-protected against any temptation, conceit, or malice. But the Dark forces kept eroding, first almost unnoticeably, all good things they built with so much suffering and struggle. This civilization, which dwelt in what is still known as the Human Empire, reached its pinnacle in the Second Era of Damos, and was led by Denir the Wise. The Royal King was fond of culture, philosophy, and arts. After no physician could prevent his wife from dying of an incurable sickness, he set out in pursuit of knowledge that could set peace to his troubled thoughts and feelings about the meaning of life.</p>

<h2>Denir's Death in the Cannon of the Void</h2>
<div> He left all his riches behind and set off on a long pilgrimage through the Isolated Lands to look for an ancestral knowledge that could quench his unbearable sorrow. Years passed and Denir grew old. He could only find scattered traces of what seemed to be the commandments of an ancient brotherhood that had long since been extinct. A shredded map he unearthed in some ancient ruins in Gilgegard pointed towards the frozen mountains of Kheravar. Even though the years took their toll on his body, he defied his waning life and forced himself to climb up through sharp edges and ridged ladders, through snow storms and the most inhospitable places, until he reached the Cannon of the Void. Denir reached the top of the Cannon on the brink of death, but he gathered up his last energy to shout these ominous words:“Why?! Why, no matter how hard I tried, could I not find the remedy to the grief that consumed my soul?! ""</div>
<div>He then fell asleep, never to wake up... at least not in this life.<br/><br/>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Theories on Eternal Recurrence in the Isolated Lands</span></h3>
<p>Eternal Recurrence is a phenomenon that has been studied by the most prominent scholars of Gilgegard. In this, the elves' theories share some ideas with those of humans. The first ones to incorporate these ideas into their religious practices were the Asemites, a tribe that dwelt in the North of Kheravar, at the Duirdan Plains . The remnants of their death rituals clearly show that they were convinced of the transmigration of the human soul. They followed a strict rule: it was forbidden to incinerate the deceased body, as they discovered through astral methods that the soul took four to eight days to leave the body and join the universal forces, at which point it would incarnate a new body if it hadn't been able to attain enlightenment. This has yet to be demonstrated by human scholars. All modern trials on this matter have been a complete failure, even though the elves claim to have discovered some truth in such rituals.</p>

<h2>Relationship Between Good and Evil and Eternal Recurrence</h2>
<p>Nobody is totally good; nobody is totally evil. Each being is a mix of both in varying degrees, regardless of whether or not one is aware of this. The criminal that is hanged because has killed a local tax collector is as guilty as his executioners; the warrior that severs his enemy's head is as guilty as the latter, who chose to be warrior and thus exposed himself to such a fate. The different religions that spread across the Isolated Lands have this belief of good and evil. The White Triad, for example, came as good personified in their avatars Grand Master Teoil and the White Wizards. But even if they were demigods, they were incarnated in flesh and had to gain control of tendencies and temptations of the body, so one could say bad is within them as well. The Dark Triad, in its original form, is naught but twisted good. But why is one born into poverty and another surrounded by abundant richness? Do the deeds of our past life determine our next incarnation? Are the things that we accomplish in this life judged on a  scale that will determine the starting point and tendencies of the next?</p>

<h2>How Old Are the White Wizards?</h2>
</div>
<div>Nobody knows how old the three White Wizards are. Always cloaked in white robes and holding wooden staves with gnarled tops, sporting long, soft white beards, and moving gracefully, with hooded cloaks on their backs, their bodies defy the passage of time and seem to remain unchanged. Only a few light wrinkles under their wide-open eyes can be spotted after intense scrutiny. There are written records that talk about some White Wizards when King Athon was ruling the Old Human Empire. Are they the same ones that live among us, trying to spread their message of peace in our troubled lands?</div>

<h2>Elves in Agaroth</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>The elves first dwelt in Agaroth. These once-barren lands turned fertile thanks to a clever invention of the first elven settlers, who devised a complex system of irrigation channels to take the water from the Murky Sea into the mainland. Thus the first oases were born, subsequently giving rise to the first bits of trading activity that extended to Gilgegard in the east, which was part of the Human Empire.</div>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://autoloot-games.com/img/TDT_KS_turn-based.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Combat in TDT:DD is turn-based. When your party engages in a fight, you can attack or be attacked by the enemy. Who attacks first is determined by the perception rate and the range of vision of your party. When the combat starts, one side attacks, and the other waits for its turn. When it’s your enemies’ turn, you party members can counterattack automatically and perform pre-planned actions that carry over from former turns. You can wreak havoc among your enemies if you plan your turns carefully!</p>
<h1>The Chaos Factor</h1>
<p>Strategy is very important, and so is action. We’ve devised a system that will allow you to play the way you want. One mechanism we provide is the Chaos Factor. Chaos is a kind of spiritual energy, and you’ll decide the risk to take to try to harness it. You can prepare a skill for latter turns, thus enhancing its effect, but this will at the same time increase the chance that something goes wrong when performing that skill due to the Chaos Factor.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<p>The chaos factor for Sinister Tattoo is5%, so there is a 5% chance of failure when performing this ability. If you give a boost to this ability, the chaos factor can raise to 15% or more. The chaos factor of the skills can also be influenced by the game zone, events in the story, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/443/801/b475cd4c1e741a889cac5a9a34ac9ce1_large.jpg?1363224792"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Let’s be more specific:</p>
<p>The aforementioned ability allows the Elite Thief to create clones of himself along the battlefield, confusing the enemy or creating chaos when they attack the clones instead. This ability has some specializations that grant buffs, debuffs and many more effects depending on the branch you choose.</p>
<p>This ability has a 5% chance of failing. When this happens, the clones only will last for 1 turn. Also, if an enemy attacks one of the clones, the enemy willreceive extra movements and damage if the chaos factor was in effect. This 5% chance is permanent but is a small amount… it’s up to you to decide whether to enhance the skill and raise the chaos factor to 15% or stay into that 5% security zone. In the case of the Conjurer of Bones, you can increase the risk to summon a more powerful Ghoul Ent or a Walking Cabbage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/443/796/d8e20d921514c0fcc01864a2edf8a516_large.jpg?1363224641"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1><strong>Stats</strong></h1>
<p>There are 3 different types of stats: physical, mental, and spiritual. We want to create a logical synergy between the different classes. For example, a Black Warrior can reach the strength cap, but not for power or concentration. Stats are as diverse as armor, perception rate, magical damage, regeneration rate, and many others, which allow you make numerous unique builds.</p>
<p>Each time the player levels up, they will get points to increase their party members’ stats or their special class abilities.</p>
<p>Each level will grant you between 7-15 points to spend on stats, and 7-15 more points for abilities. There is a 30-level cap, so the way you assign these points will go a long way in determining how you play the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/455/044/ed7470dad09530aad5b75994350382e4_large.jpg?1363697357"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Abilities</h1>
<p>Abilities allow you adapt combat to your playstyle. With them, you can create an almost unlimited amount of different builds. Each ability is unique and powerful, but to take it to the maximum you will need to learn about how to best combine them with the abilities of your party members to optimize the outcome of your attacks.</p>
<p>Specializations include the abilities to heal your allies, curse your enemies, or enhance your character.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/443/763/1d103c2c73ccc192b8e08479e59bd0f2_large.png?1363223784"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Let’s take an example, the Conjurer of Bones' “Invoke Stick Insect:”</p>
<p>This ability summons a minion from the Underworld that will throw spears at your enemies. Here are its specializations:</p>
<p><strong>1 – Petrify:</strong> each point used here will increase the chances to paralyze a target for two turns.</p>
<p><strong>2. Damage Increase:</strong> each point will increase the damage done by the summoned creature.</p>
<p><strong>3. Camouflage: </strong>increases the chance to grant invisibility to the summoned creature for 10 turns.</p>
<p><strong>4- Insect Cloning</strong>: increases the chance that a new minion respawns where the deceased minion died without the need to use the ability to summon a new one again.</p>
<p>Each skill is different and defined by class. As you can see in the example, an ability combined with its specializations is not only about summoning a creature but many subtler effects. Each ability, especially if boosted for latter turns,can change the fate of a battle.</p>

These funds will help us to pay our 5 team members and stay afloat during this time.

The Dark Triad: Dragon’s Death is a 3D-isometric, turn-based computer RPG with an amazing epic history and a fresh dynamic turn-based combat, developed by Autoloot Games Ltd. Autoloot is an indie studio formed by veteran industry game developers from Ubisoft, Gameloft, and Funcom that have participated in the development of games such as Age of Conan, Warhammer Online, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, Heroes of Sparta 2 and Prince of Persia, among many others.
 

 

A deep history with unexpected twists and many secrets to uncover. 
 Brutal and bloody turn-based combat. A brand new system where you define the degree of action and strategy and the speed of battles.
 Choose from 5 different cool classes. 
A brand new skills and specialty system. Customize your own builds.
Hundreds of quests and side quests, with intriguing dialogues. 
 A vast map for you to enjoy for dozens of hours. 
 An incredible host of enemies for you to slash and crush. 
 Pets and Sacred Guardians to assist you in the heat of the battle. 
 Fully detailed characters and environments in 3D. 
 Items system with thousands of combinations and unique artifacts. 
 Epic Achievements.
 Play extra-difficulty levels and challenge yourself against beastly elite bosses and enemies.
 

 
We’ve spent 11 long months creating our own proprietary 3D-isometric editor; a model and animations importer; a static, light-mapping, and shadow casting system; a 3D particle and billboards system; and we already have hundreds of tri-dimensional models between NPCs, props, architecture, and environment, plus our own propietary dialogue and scripting tool. We have almost all the technology into place to put our focus on developing content exclusively. This means we have now the time to work hard on the combat logic, the AI, adding and fleshing out the dialogues, side quests, and creating vast lands and secrets for you to explore and discover. We want to surprise you. We'll pay homage to the best CRPGs, but we also want to take the risk to do it our own way.
 

 
The Dark Triad will allow you to chose among 5 different classes. The stats and skills system is being coded at the moment, and in the coming months it will need to be constantly adjusted and thouroughly tested to create a compelling combat system of gameplay. We want combat to pose a challenge and have a remarkable strategic component, even though you can always adjust its difficulty on-the-go to play in an easier or more difficult mode (though it will be always turn-based).
The stats and skills system has been made from scratch. You’ll find a really fresh and original mechanic blended with classic concepts, and this will hopefully cater to turn-based fans by providing some good fun and a challenge! We’ve already written 40% of the dialogues and lore, and the next step will be implementing and associating the dialogues with the characters' actions and choices, skills, stats, items, etc to add the maximum of of gameplay options.
We want you to feel that NPCs and characters are alive, that they have their own agendas, and that they remember what you told or did to them and act accordingly depending on their persona.
 

 
King Jonah disappeared after Vlarmor and the the Dark Wizards besieged Khandor, capital city of the Gilgegard Empire. The evil Dark Triad's power has spread everywhere, and people are getting killed in a macabre survival-of-the-fittest game. To add to their misery, villagers are falling sick after consuming food poisoned with adamantium. 

Also, Akhazal, the Last Dragon, has been seized by the Dark Wizards for nefarious purposes.
A coalition of orcs and goblins are trying to enter Gilgegard through the mountains' Deep Paths with the help of human outcasts, and King Odenar from the Kheravar Empire remains silent about which side he will join...

Meanwhile, the Wisdom Alliance, assembled in a secret place in the Old Human Empire, has agreed to send the best warrior from each race to find King Jonah, allegedly hidden deep in the catacombs of his castle. A grumpy dwarf, a swift halfling, an unflinching elf, and a human ex-knight who deserted the royal guard will try to sneak into Vlarmor’s Castle with the help of a mysterious ranger to find King Jonah and the Last Dragon.
 

Where are the two remaining White Wizards, who were tasked with protecting the king? Has Danath, King Jonah’s future wife, also been killed? Are the the Dark Wizards using Vlarmor for their own obscure plans? Who are the Dark Ones? Why  was the soldier so determined to help find King Jonah after deserting from the Royal Gryphon Knights? And who’s Khain?

Elves in Agaroth
 
The elves first dwelt in Agaroth. These once-barren lands turned fertile thanks to a clever invention of the first elven settlers, who devised a complex system of irrigation channels to take the water from the Murky Sea into the mainland. Thus the first oases were born, subsequently giving rise to the first bits of trading activity that extended to Gilgegard in the east, which was part of the Human Empire.
 
 

 
Combat in TDT:DD is turn-based. When your party engages in a fight, you can attack or be attacked by the enemy. Who attacks first is determined by the perception rate and the range of vision of your party. When the combat starts, one side attacks, and the other waits for its turn. When it’s your enemies’ turn, you party members can counterattack automatically and perform pre-planned actions that carry over from former turns. You can wreak havoc among your enemies if you plan your turns carefully!
The Chaos Factor
Strategy is very important, and so is action. We’ve devised a system that will allow you to play the way you want. One mechanism we provide is the Chaos Factor. Chaos is a kind of spiritual energy, and you’ll decide the risk to take to try to harness it. You can prepare a skill for latter turns, thus enhancing its effect, but this will at the same time increase the chance that something goes wrong when performing that skill due to the Chaos Factor.
An example:
The chaos factor for Sinister Tattoo is5%, so there is a 5% chance of failure when performing this ability. If you give a boost to this ability, the chaos factor can raise to 15% or more. The chaos factor of the skills can also be influenced by the game zone, events in the story, etc.
 

Let’s be more specific:
The aforementioned ability allows the Elite Thief to create clones of himself along the battlefield, confusing the enemy or creating chaos when they attack the clones instead. This ability has some specializations that grant buffs, debuffs and many more effects depending on the branch you choose.
This ability has a 5% chance of failing. When this happens, the clones only will last for 1 turn. Also, if an enemy attacks one of the clones, the enemy willreceive extra movements and damage if the chaos factor was in effect. This 5% chance is permanent but is a small amount… it’s up to you to decide whether to enhance the skill and raise the chaos factor to 15% or stay into that 5% security zone. In the case of the Conjurer of Bones, you can increase the risk to summon a more powerful Ghoul Ent or a Walking Cabbage.
 

Stats
There are 3 different types of stats: physical, mental, and spiritual. We want to create a logical synergy between the different classes. For example, a Black Warrior can reach the strength cap, but not for power or concentration. Stats are as diverse as armor, perception rate, magical damage, regeneration rate, and many others, which allow you make numerous unique builds.
Each time the player levels up, they will get points to increase their party members’ stats or their special class abilities.
Each level will grant you between 7-15 points to spend on stats, and 7-15 more points for abilities. There is a 30-level cap, so the way you assign these points will go a long way in determining how you play the game.
 

 
Abilities
Abilities allow you adapt combat to your playstyle. With them, you can create an almost unlimited amount of different builds. Each ability is unique and powerful, but to take it to the maximum you will need to learn about how to best combine them with the abilities of your party members to optimize the outcome of your attacks.
Specializations include the abilities to heal your allies, curse your enemies, or enhance your character.
 

 
Let’s take an example, the Conjurer of Bones' “Invoke Stick Insect:”
This ability summons a minion from the Underworld that will throw spears at your enemies. Here are its specializations:
1 – Petrify: each point used here will increase the chances to paralyze a target for two turns.
2. Damage Increase: each point will increase the damage done by the summoned creature.
3. Camouflage: increases the chance to grant invisibility to the summoned creature for 10 turns.
4- Insect Cloning: increases the chance that a new minion respawns where the deceased minion died without the need to use the ability to summon a new one again.
Each skill is different and defined by class. As you can see in the example, an ability combined with its specializations is not only about summoning a creature but many subtler effects. Each ability, especially if boosted for latter turns,can change the fate of a battle.
[THESE ARE THE BASICS FOR COMBAT. WE’LL KEEP ADDING MORE INFO AND CLEARING UP CONCEPTS IN COMING UPDATES]
 


Autoloot Games Ltd., founded by Miguel A.L.M. and Abel Bascuñana, is a computer gaming company based in the UK that aims to bring back the magic of old-school RPGs.
We’ve been playing RPGs for more than 20 years and prior to funding our own company, we’ve worked together on other professional game projects (see images below). Almost a year ago, thanks to our combined experience, we set out together to accomplish our dream of making a classic RPG in a 3D environment.


David Lopez- 3D artist: Professional projects: Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell (Ubisoft), Heroes of Sparta 2 (Gameloft)

David Lucena- Coder: Professional projects: Prince of Persia, Rayman (Gameloft mobile), Elite Forces 77 (Abylight)

Abel Bascuñana- Writer & Game Designer: Professional projects: Age of Conan (Funcom), Warhammer Online (GOA), Dragon City (Social Point), Social Empires (Social Point)

Rafater- Graphic Artist: TaG (C&C Intl.), Dark Gods (Norma Editorial), The Sexiest Art of Rafater (Ed. Babylon), Black Age, Labyrinth Madness, Kololoko

Jose Manuel Alcaraz- Lead Programmer: Spermatozoon (XboxLive), Tower Defender propietary engine, 3D platform engine, Voxel Engine, 2.5D Animation Editor, etc. (Charcostudios)

We’ve opened an Indiegogo and Verkami campaign for all of you that want to help us support the game development for the next two months until we can succeed in our Kickstarter campaign. These funds will help us to pay our 5 team members and stay afloat during this time. We don’t have any publisher behind us and before approaching any one we will try to go crowdfunding so we can remain independent game developers (unless it’s a known rpg publisher that could guarantee us IP rights and the max creative freedom).
 @BrianFargo (inXile Founder): ""This game deserves a look at.""

<p></p> <p>My name is Jerry LeNeave, I'm a journalist and freelance writer in the tabletop RPG industry. I've been running <a href=""http://www.dreadgazebo.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>The Dread Gazebo</b></a> for 4 years now, and although I don't plan on stopping anytime soon, I need to bring the site's quality up to par. The problem is, I won't be able to do it without some help.</p>
<p>Aside from the blog, you may know me from my work with <b><a href=""http://www.ObsidianPortal.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Obsidian Portal</a></b> as their Content Director, and the lead host and producer of their<b> <a href=""http://hastepodcast.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Haste Podcast</a></b> - both of which have won gold and silver <a href=""http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>ENnie Awards</b></a> on multiple occasions.

<h3>How We're Improving The Site</h3>
<div>Whether you're familiar with <a href=""http://dreadgazebo.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>The Dread Gazebo</b></a> or not, just visiting it once should be enough to see that we're dedicated to creating quality, readable, unique, and aesthetically pleasing gaming journalism for over 4 years now. However, our setup is becoming dated - I'm recording videos on an cell phone that's taped to a duct-tape bolstered tripod in the best lighting conditions we can muster. Said lighting ranges from ""harsh overbright lamp"" to ""yellowed incandescent"" to ""not quite enough, please tell me what I'm supposed to be looking at"".</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With visuals and video content becoming more and more prevalent and desired in today's media, the sub-par videos just aren't cutting it anymore. Neither is having a downed website for weeks at a time due to security holes from an outdated (and thus exploitable) blog theme. Not to mention the possibility of having it display as a jumbled mess depending on what device/browser you're using.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>To accomplish fixing all of these issues at minimum we're going to need an actual camera that's not a webcam or a cell phone, a tripod without a 6 CON score, and a subscription to our theme provider's services for updates and security patches. Real lighting would be nice too, but let's tackle the basics first.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3>Why I Need Help</h3></div>
<div>Being able to purchase updated equipment and software to help produce content for the blog has been a struggle lately. I work two jobs, own a home, I'm putting 2 kids through school, and my student loans are bearing down on me. My better half has just finished her degree and is currently looking for work and we share a single car. So, as you could imagine, disposable income isn't something that I have much of right now.</div>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">This is where your contributions can help make all the difference here, these aren't expenses I can cover myself right now. The running and upkeep of the blog has always been an out-of-pocket thing for me, a labor of passion. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">However, it's getting to the point where simply keeping up with the basics of running the site are called into question. </span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>Almost all of the gaming materials you see reviewed on the blog are provided as promotional product for review. All because I am in the good graces of many publishers and game developers and am lucky enough to get these sort of things for free in an exchange for candid press coverage. It's a pretty sweet gig, I'm not going to lie. Unfortunately, board games and RPGS are not redeemable for the supplies needed to actually run the site.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">What this all boils down to is that I really just want to be able to keep bringing the best stuff possible to as many people as I can.

<p><b>Reward: </b>Adventure Module: <i>A King With No Crown. </i>A dungeon crawl for use with 5th edition D&amp;D <i>(see FAQ regarding licensing)</i></p>
<p>This third and <b>final</b> stretch goal is going to take my previously <b><a href=""http://www.onepagedungeon.info/one-page-dungeon-contest-2012"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">award winning</a> </b>system neutral dungeon, A King With No Crown, and turn it into a full fledged adventure for characters level 5-7. It <i>won't</i> be crammed onto a single page, but it <i>will </i>be crammed with flavor! Full of unique (new) monsters, artifacts, and challenges for use in your 5th edition D&amp;D game(s).

<p>I've always been a big producer of original content for fantasy RPGs. D&amp;D is usually my flavor but I also like to roll system neutral. That being said, this next stretch goal is going to be an exclusive PDF full of 8 new character backgrounds for use in your 5th edition D&amp;D games, along with guidelines on how to put them to use in other systems. <b>This will be available to everyone who has backed at the $5 level or higher.</b> (ETA: Q1 2015) [<a href=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/782545/files/20140812063509-BackgroundCoverMockup.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cover Mockup</a>]</p>
<p>This is a test bed for me to try and gauge interest to see how much people desire my writing and original content for games.

Maintenance costs for the game itself will be low as server costs for a turn-based game are far less than with other formats.We know the scope of work required to finish this project and we are prepared for it - our passion and excitement have never been stronger. We have spent too much time and devoted too much energy - nothing will get in the way of seeing this project through!",28.0,1,"1 Campaign

El proyecto está en fase temprana de desarrollo y es, como he dicho antes, un juego que ofrece un gran reto en intensos niveles.

Through our startup bootcamps we help people extrapolate ideas into ventures and designed FounderDeck as an educational aid.  We think anyone can use FounderDeck to plan a new venture and hone their entrepreneurial skills post-launch and are excited to offer it to you through this campaign. 
Meeting our target will help us place a custom order for high quality decks to be manufactured by our production partner and contributions to our campaign let you pre-order 1 or multiple FounderDecks - for yourself, portfolio, friends or family.
   


Help Us Get FounderDeck Into Your Hands :)
 Some more background on this campaign:  We need to raise at least $3,500 to place a large enough order with our production partner to print high quality cards and ship them in custom packaging.  The more FounderDeck games you order the more you save, and the more you can earn - perks include discounted games plus investor meetings with top professional Canadian Venture Capitalists. After lots of prototyping we've got a great looking deck and box, so even if we don't make our target we can ship orders. But, if we do make our campaign target the size of the order will allow us to ship even higher quality cards in deluxe custom packaging.    
How FounderDeck Helps Entrepreneurs We've put prototypes of the game into the hands of startup founders and seen that:  Most entrepreneurs have only asked themselves ~20% of the questions in the game, and immediately see value in figuring how they'd answer the rest. Investors playing with our prototype are excited to give it to their portfolio companies and use it to continually assess company vision etc... The game helps founders relate details of their entrepreneurial journey to friends and family in a fun way.
Founders playing the game with their staff/teams find that it helps everyone get on the same page - expressing common wants, needs and goals.
The deck is an essential study guide for anyone preparing for investor meetings - it contains the majority of questions professional investors ask founders, and helps them start questioning themselves in advance of being put on the spot when pitching.

<p>The game has been serviced on Steam since March 29, 2013 as an <strong>early access game</strong>.  </p>
<p>So far, we have learnt many things. Good thing was there are many players who love this type of game. Bad thing was that our business model in Archeblade is too humble.</p>
<p>We hoped that Archeblade would be a ‘<strong>non pay to win</strong>’ game. And we thought we could get enough money for a final version of the game with selling just characters and skins like League of Legend does. </p>
<p>But we are wrong. </p>
<p>Only <strong>1.5%</strong> of the players have purchased for those ‘<strong>non pay to win’</strong> features.</p>
<p>And now? we are facing a critical issue. Publishers and investors are not interested in such a 'kind' free to play business model. </p>
<p>However, we strongly believe that Archeblade will be a great game once its completed. The total download of the game hits <strong>500,000</strong>. and currently, we are ranked <strong>91th</strong> biggest steam official group out of <strong>8963</strong> groups. Archeblade indeed has a potential. We are just one step away from the completion of the game.  </p>
<p>We need your support to maintain this game as a free to play game.</p>

 Users control one of several characters, each with strong personalities based on the acclaimed Korean fantasy novel 'Archeblade'. Archeblade recaptures the highlights of classic fighting games such as Street Fighter, Tekken and MOBA genre games while incorporating a plethora of modern gameplay action!
More than your typical fighting game, Archeblade dares gamers to take the plunge and revisit the world of third-person fighting games. Delivering vivid graphics and action packed gameplay, Archeblade's compelling and dynamic package is sure to please all potential thrill-seekers! 
 


      >> Archeblade Steam store page

      >> Early Access Basic Pack (DLC) 

      >> Early Access Premium Pack (DLC) 

      >> Search ‘Archeblade’ on Steam

      >> Search ‘Archeblade’ on Youtube


































 Users can choose one of several characters, each with strong and unique personalities. Characters use their own  distinctive style of weapons and skills, allowing a wide range of  choices and identities for gamers to choose from. A total 12  characters are available right now, and continuous improvements  and updates will be rolled out.
    Archeblade supports up to 7 VS 7 battles, and cooperative gameplay, matching  your friends against other opponents.
 

 Archeblade utilizes a fighting-game style combo system, using a configuration of 9 keyboard buttons (w, a, s, d, e, f, shift, alt, and space), along with two mouse buttons. Users can make their own moves and combos by combining these buttons and developing their own unique skills! Try to make as many combos as you can and perfect your special moves!
 
 

The user engages opponents in several arenas with different objectives. 
Choose your arena as a game mode: team deathmatch, capture the pylon, free-for-all, and more! Additional new maps are coming!


 Archeblade is based on the fantasy novel ‘Archeblade’ written by Junghoon Hong. Hong's extraordinary and mysterious world is brought to life by Codebrush Games, capturing all the depth and themes of the original novel!


 
  

 Users can take advantages of Steam features such as digital distribution, achievement, community features, automated game updates, in-game voice, and chat functionality.

 
 
  


Archeblade is free to play! All you need is a steam ID. Don’t hesitate to invite your friends over to battle. More friends, more fun!
 
  
 
  






The game has been serviced on Steam since March 29, 2013 as an early access game.  
So far, we have learnt many things. Good thing was there are many players who love this type of game. Bad thing was that our business model in Archeblade is too humble.
We hoped that Archeblade would be a ‘non pay to win’ game. And we thought we could get enough money for a final version of the game with selling just characters and skins like League of Legend does. 
But we are wrong. 
Only 1.5% of the players have purchased for those ‘non pay to win’ features.
And now? we are facing a critical issue. Publishers and investors are not interested in such a 'kind' free to play business model. 
However, we strongly believe that Archeblade will be a great game once its completed. The total download of the game hits 500,000. and currently, we are ranked 91th biggest steam official group out of 8963 groups. Archeblade indeed has a potential. We are just one step away from the completion of the game.  
We need your support to maintain this game as a free to play game.
 

  









          
       
 





With your generous support, we will be able to implement these sweet features :)

<p><em>- Salvaged Diary Entry</em></p>
<p>In 2019, the humanity collapsed under its own influence.  The <strong>Red Sky Phenomenon </strong>plagued the world, saturating the once blue skies into a blood red color.  300 brilliant scientists from around the world were gathered to combat the phenomenon; they were called <strong>Project Domini.  The Vershina</strong>, 7 of the smartest scientists, led the project with steadfast determination.  After two years of research, they came up with a solution; a large membrane dome was created as a last stand for mankind.  Survivors from around the world were evacuated into the <strong>Haven</strong>, and society was recreated.  Humans were given a second chance.</p>
<p>The <strong>Vershina</strong> took the lead and forged a path for mankind.  Rebuilding society under their overwatch, the 7 Scientists ruled over their own cities; each built with their own, unique vision.  Each scientist took passion in their own cities, and proudly built it to their personalities.  The cities took on distinctive characteristics; one city turned out to become a center of the finest cuisines while another is built on the most advanced technology around.  With the ever-expanding diversity, things were looking bright for the human race.  A new age of innovation and progress was at hand.</p>
<p>Many years later, the world is in chaos once more.  Conflicting visions and petty rivalries split the seven scientists, each confining themselves to their own cities.  The people who once praised the seven scientists as Gods begin to lose faith.  Uproars and revolutions become more common as people became disgruntled with the leaders.  Eventually, the people snapped, and called for change.  The <strong>Haven </strong>was divided between those that supported the <strong>Vershina</strong> and those who opposed them.  War broke out and englufed the <strong>Haven</strong> in blood and fire.  The only survivng member of the original <strong>Vershina</strong> was a man named James, and he was left with the responsibility of ruling the <strong>Haven </strong>with 6 new leaders who do not understand the magnitude of things that were lost so many years ago.  While the world had somewhat settled down, the scars of war still remained.</p>
<p>And it only took one man, one girl, and one secret to set the conflict into motion once more.</p>
<p><strong> Welcome to Project Domini.</strong></p>
<p><em><span>""It looks like we are back where we started. I guess we really haven't learnt anything.""</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>- Unknown Voice Log</span></em><em><em> </em></em></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/798994/pictures/full/20130508091612-reference.jpg?1368029777"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are Project Domini, a group of students from Japan who are attempting to create a story based strategy game.  While being a hobbyist project, we are ambitious and motivated to deliver the best possible game in all respects.  Gameplay, music, art, and story; everything is important in making a coherent and exciting experience. </p>
<p>While this is the first game we've ever worked on, we have some credentials to back us up.  We have all taken computer classes at school, so we understand fundamental programming.  Our programmer is extremely skilled and has been programming ever since he was born (seriously).  The Director is a gamer who enjoys stories with good stories and lore and even writes his own lore and stories once in a while.  Our two story writers are talented to say the least; one of them is an avid journalist who strives to capture every aspect of our school with captive vocabulary.  Although this does sound like much (it probably isn't), we are still young, and we will have more opportunities to grow and become more proficient in game developping.  Our goal is to grow with this game.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/798997/pictures/full/20130508091652-Snow.jpg?1368029819"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What is this game about?</h3>
<p>This game is a strategy game with a deep story.  Your actions and decisions will forge the story: you will be the storyteller.  By conquering your enemies, more secrets will be uncovered, and the story will progress, throwing you deeper into the conspiracy, until there's no way out.  Choose how you will carry out your conquest: will you crush all that stand before you, will you negotiate peacefully, or will you manipulate your enemies to fall into submission?  Take advantage of your enemies and their weaknesses and use their psychological flaws against them.</p>
<p>The gameplay will be based on two fundamental sections: strategy and combat.  The strategy section will play like..well...a strategy game.  Here you will be able to manage your army, decide who you want to conquer and plan our your next moves.  There will also be a complex reputation system in game.  You will either be feared, respected, or neutral with other cities, and depending on the degree of your reputaion, their reaction to you will be different.  For example, cities who repspect you are more likely to trade with you while cities that fear you will act hostile or will surrender to you.</p>
<p>The combat section brings a faster pace to the game.  Though this isn't set in stone, we are planning to go for a lightning fast combat system that requires quick thinking and long term strategizing.  Now that's kind of vague.  So allow me to explain.  The game will be like an encounter system.  If your troops run into enemy units, or if you declare war on other cities, you will be moved into 'combat mode'.  This will be composed of a grid style battlefield of varying size and shape.  In each grid, you will be able to place a unit.  The combat is divided into two stages: formation and combat.  During the formation stage, you will place your units on the battlefield in your desired formation.  Units include lightweight shotgunners, all around riflemen, long range snipers, attack helicopters, and more.  Each unit will have a unique range, cooldown between attacks, and other attributes.  You can also have formations that boost your overall power.  In the combat phase, everything moves into motion.  With lightning quick reflexes, select units and target your enemies.  Eliminate your foes by making full use of your formation and your cooldowns.  Be warned; lightining fast reflexes are required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/798992/pictures/full/20130508091532-Steampunk_City.jpg?1368029736"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why do we need funding?</h3>
<p>To ensure that our game is the best quality it can be, we decided to hire two talented artists to help us out with the project.  While they have so many other opportunities, they decided to work with us.  So we want to pay the artists as much as they can for their hard work.  $1000 and any extra funds will go to the artists, while $500 dollars will go to paying for different programs and maybe some snacks for us:) </p>
<p>All jokes aside, let us explain the math.  Our rough estimate for the number of art pieces for this game is around 50~60.  Since we plan to pay $15 for each art piece, the total will amount to around $1000.  Of course we would love to pay more because honestly, their art pieces are spectacular.  So, most of the extra funds (anything left over after we subtract what we need) will go to the artists.  This means that all funds above $1500 will go to the artists, no questions asked.  </p>
<p>For people who like the ideas but cannot fund this project, we understand.  So what can you do?  The question is, what can't you do? (besides funding)  You can share this with your friends, post it on your facebook, twitter, reddit, anything.  Spread the word; thats the only way we can get this idea out to everyone.  Give us some input. Tell us what you like, what you don't like, what you think will work and what you think will not.  Hit us an email telling us you like our project; the moral confidence boost that will give us is HUGE.  Give us your ideas, tell us what you want to see in the game.  Anything is appreciated.</p>

- Salvaged Diary Entry
In 2019, the humanity collapsed under its own influence.  The Red Sky Phenomenon plagued the world, saturating the once blue skies into a blood red color.  300 brilliant scientists from around the world were gathered to combat the phenomenon; they were called Project Domini.  The Vershina, 7 of the smartest scientists, led the project with steadfast determination.  After two years of research, they came up with a solution; a large membrane dome was created as a last stand for mankind.  Survivors from around the world were evacuated into the Haven, and society was recreated.  Humans were given a second chance.
The Vershina took the lead and forged a path for mankind.  Rebuilding society under their overwatch, the 7 Scientists ruled over their own cities; each built with their own, unique vision.  Each scientist took passion in their own cities, and proudly built it to their personalities.  The cities took on distinctive characteristics; one city turned out to become a center of the finest cuisines while another is built on the most advanced technology around.  With the ever-expanding diversity, things were looking bright for the human race.  A new age of innovation and progress was at hand.
Many years later, the world is in chaos once more.  Conflicting visions and petty rivalries split the seven scientists, each confining themselves to their own cities.  The people who once praised the seven scientists as Gods begin to lose faith.  Uproars and revolutions become more common as people became disgruntled with the leaders.  Eventually, the people snapped, and called for change.  The Haven was divided between those that supported the Vershina and those who opposed them.  War broke out and englufed the Haven in blood and fire.  The only survivng member of the original Vershina was a man named James, and he was left with the responsibility of ruling the Haven with 6 new leaders who do not understand the magnitude of things that were lost so many years ago.  While the world had somewhat settled down, the scars of war still remained.
And it only took one man, one girl, and one secret to set the conflict into motion once more.
 Welcome to Project Domini.
""It looks like we are back where we started. I guess we really haven't learnt anything.""
- Unknown Voice Log 

Who are we?
We are Project Domini, a group of students from Japan who are attempting to create a story based strategy game.  While being a hobbyist project, we are ambitious and motivated to deliver the best possible game in all respects.  Gameplay, music, art, and story; everything is important in making a coherent and exciting experience. 
While this is the first game we've ever worked on, we have some credentials to back us up.  We have all taken computer classes at school, so we understand fundamental programming.  Our programmer is extremely skilled and has been programming ever since he was born (seriously).  The Director is a gamer who enjoys stories with good stories and lore and even writes his own lore and stories once in a while.  Our two story writers are talented to say the least; one of them is an avid journalist who strives to capture every aspect of our school with captive vocabulary.  Although this does sound like much (it probably isn't), we are still young, and we will have more opportunities to grow and become more proficient in game developping.  Our goal is to grow with this game.

What is this game about?
This game is a strategy game with a deep story.  Your actions and decisions will forge the story: you will be the storyteller.  By conquering your enemies, more secrets will be uncovered, and the story will progress, throwing you deeper into the conspiracy, until there's no way out.  Choose how you will carry out your conquest: will you crush all that stand before you, will you negotiate peacefully, or will you manipulate your enemies to fall into submission?  Take advantage of your enemies and their weaknesses and use their psychological flaws against them.
The gameplay will be based on two fundamental sections: strategy and combat.  The strategy section will play like..well...a strategy game.  Here you will be able to manage your army, decide who you want to conquer and plan our your next moves.  There will also be a complex reputation system in game.  You will either be feared, respected, or neutral with other cities, and depending on the degree of your reputaion, their reaction to you will be different.  For example, cities who repspect you are more likely to trade with you while cities that fear you will act hostile or will surrender to you.
The combat section brings a faster pace to the game.  Though this isn't set in stone, we are planning to go for a lightning fast combat system that requires quick thinking and long term strategizing.  Now that's kind of vague.  So allow me to explain.  The game will be like an encounter system.  If your troops run into enemy units, or if you declare war on other cities, you will be moved into 'combat mode'.  This will be composed of a grid style battlefield of varying size and shape.  In each grid, you will be able to place a unit.  The combat is divided into two stages: formation and combat.  During the formation stage, you will place your units on the battlefield in your desired formation.  Units include lightweight shotgunners, all around riflemen, long range snipers, attack helicopters, and more.  Each unit will have a unique range, cooldown between attacks, and other attributes.  You can also have formations that boost your overall power.  In the combat phase, everything moves into motion.  With lightning quick reflexes, select units and target your enemies.  Eliminate your foes by making full use of your formation and your cooldowns.  Be warned; lightining fast reflexes are required.
 

Why do we need funding?
To ensure that our game is the best quality it can be, we decided to hire two talented artists to help us out with the project.  While they have so many other opportunities, they decided to work with us.  So we want to pay the artists as much as they can for their hard work.  $1000 and any extra funds will go to the artists, while $500 dollars will go to paying for different programs and maybe some snacks for us:) 
All jokes aside, let us explain the math.  Our rough estimate for the number of art pieces for this game is around 50~60.  Since we plan to pay $15 for each art piece, the total will amount to around $1000.  Of course we would love to pay more because honestly, their art pieces are spectacular.  So, most of the extra funds (anything left over after we subtract what we need) will go to the artists.  This means that all funds above $1500 will go to the artists, no questions asked.  
For people who like the ideas but cannot fund this project, we understand.  So what can you do?  The question is, what can't you do? (besides funding)  You can share this with your friends, post it on your facebook, twitter, reddit, anything.  Spread the word; thats the only way we can get this idea out to everyone.  Give us some input. Tell us what you like, what you don't like, what you think will work and what you think will not.  Hit us an email telling us you like our project; the moral confidence boost that will give us is HUGE.  Give us your ideas, tell us what you want to see in the game.  Anything is appreciated.

Backstory
The world was thrown into chaos with the arrival of the Red Sky Phenomenon in 2015 A.D.

<h3><b>Design</b></h3>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We understand there are many phones with different sizes and micro USB layouts. Our design allows docking of virtually all smartphones that are available on the market. Ingeo Dock works with phone cases as long as Micro USB port is exposed. </span><br/></p>
<p>We also understand docking and undocking need to be made easy. Our unique design makes it as simple as dropping your phone into the dock and picking it up. </p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>The dock has an HDMI and a USB port. You can use the USB port to connect a keyboard and a mouse, access flash drives, or other peripherals. Simultaneous HDMI and USB usage supported on Samsung devices only. And yes, the dock is a charger as well. </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Starting from 2011, virtually all Android smartphones support either MHL or Slimport standard for HDMI output. Our dock supports all HDMI enabled phones, including standard MHL (5pin), Galaxy S3/S4 MHL (11pin), and Slimport interfaces using modular connectors. </span><br/></p>

<p>Our controller is designed in collaboration with <a href=""http://davidhansson.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Hansson</a>. It features a beautiful angular style, making it stand out from the pack. </p>
<p>The controller has a standard set of buttons, force feedback motors, and  a built-in accelerometer. You will be able to control games by tilting the controller with games like Temple Run.</p>

<h3><b>Where We Are At</b></h3>
<p>Our prototype shown in the video is, of course, not of the final production quality. We used 3D printing to manufacture the main parts of the dock and controller. The final product will be manufactured using molds and the exterior will be coated to enhance tactile perception and aesthetic appearance. In the end it will look even better than the concept art!</p>

<p>We are working on the interface for the modular Micro USB port with Slimport support. The final product will support all MHL and Slimport enabled phones.</p>
<p>We are practically done with the industrial design of the dock. Our expandable design will allows adjustment to the dock in order to fit phones with any sizes and orientations perfectly. The final product will require a one-time setup for the specific phone and will have a button to lock the configuration.</p>

<p>My name is James Durack and I am a Civil Engineer from Brisbane Australia. </p>
<p><b>I believe in Innovation. </b></p>
<p>For more than 1 yr now Bianca Hollis, David Nimmo and myself have been passionately slaving over a simple idea that evolved into something much larger and much more exciting than we ever anticipated. </p>
<p>I was brought up in a family that lived for creativity and innovation. Get me on your team for anything that involves drawing or painting and I guarantee you will be an international superstar within a week. </p>
<p>I am not going to lie, I would rank in at least top 7 in the world if I ever entered a worldwide Pictionary competition. If only I wasn't so b<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ored of all these drawing games/apps involving unlimited time and completely ridiculous word databases - who on this logical planet earth wants to draw Skrillex? I am assuming half of you reading this are asking 'who or what is a Skrillex!'. </span></p>
<p>My brother and I decided it was time to take our top 7 in the world Pictionary skills to the next level and add insanely intense time limits to the words we were drawing and create what we called 'Pictionary on Steroids'.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/41962/files/20130829224125-photo.PNG?1377841285"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>The screen shot above is from the select word screen in Spoodle. You can see that the category is 'Glorious Food' and you can see the time limits on the left with the star rewards on the right.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>The game would work like this, 2 people minimum. One person selects a category and a random word from that category. The 2nd person (the guesser) is told what the category is to give them a small amount of help when guessing the 2nd players drawing. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have completed majority of the app development, tested and resolved all but some remaining bugs/issues. We can even provide pre-release builds of the app for you to try. </li>
<li>We desperately need you to help us fund the marketing, final development and server side functionality of the app so we can push the game over the line for the world to enjoy. Without adequate release funding, indie game developers lie dead in the water when competing against the much larger developers with much larger budgets such as Rovio (angry birds), King (candy crush) and Zynga (draw something). </li>
<li>By helping us, not only will you help speed doodling become the next biggest craze but you will help some fellow Aussies tackle the app giants to become the next 'fruit ninja' success story.</li>

My name is James Durack and I am a Civil Engineer from Brisbane Australia. 
I believe in Innovation. 
For more than 1 yr now Bianca Hollis, David Nimmo and myself have been passionately slaving over a simple idea that evolved into something much larger and much more exciting than we ever anticipated. 
I was brought up in a family that lived for creativity and innovation. Get me on your team for anything that involves drawing or painting and I guarantee you will be an international superstar within a week. 
I am not going to lie, I would rank in at least top 7 in the world if I ever entered a worldwide Pictionary competition. If only I wasn't so bored of all these drawing games/apps involving unlimited time and completely ridiculous word databases - who on this logical planet earth wants to draw Skrillex? I am assuming half of you reading this are asking 'who or what is a Skrillex!'. 
My brother and I decided it was time to take our top 7 in the world Pictionary skills to the next level and add insanely intense time limits to the words we were drawing and create what we called 'Pictionary on Steroids'.


The screen shot above is from the select word screen in Spoodle. You can see that the category is 'Glorious Food' and you can see the time limits on the left with the star rewards on the right.

The game would work like this, 2 people minimum. One person selects a category and a random word from that category. The 2nd person (the guesser) is told what the category is to give them a small amount of help when guessing the 2nd players drawing. 
The category is - 'Sports' and the word you are drawing is 'Golf'. 
Now, heres the catch... you have 3 seconds to draw it. 
Remember that the guesser knows that the category is sports. 
'Pictionary on steroids' instantly became a favourite among our friends and family. My Boss and I even played a game one night at the pub and it wasn't even awkward when I absolutely obliterated him. 
I had to share this game with the world... but what do we call it and how do we share it?

<p>We went to the same 5 clubs every week, which was fine at first but quickly got quite boring. We were looking online for popular clubs but we only found the same 5 clubs we already knew. After searching for a while we finally found a club we wanted to go to, but at that point the night was basically over.

<p>We are students of the HTL Ottakring, which is a technical college in Vienna, Austria. We started OUVA out of our own interest and are currently doing it for our diploma thesis.

I live, study and work in Berlin (Germany). <br/>My one-man game studio is called SimaGames.<br/><br/><br/>I like retro games, platformers and RPGs, especially when they are gameplay focused and when they offer full gamepad support.<br/><br/><br/>Educational path: I finished an apprenticeship in IT, the bachelor’s 
studies and I’m now close to the end of my master’s studies in media and
 computing with a focus on game technology and interactive systems.

Sebastian Stern is in charge of the music used in Legends of Pixelia. <br/><br/>Basti spents every free minute at his computer producing music or soundscapes. Generally he focuses on epic orchestral Scoring or normal electronic music like Drum’n Bass or TripHop. He started making music on his Guitar more then 10 years ago, but today he mostly works digital. <br/><br/><br/>In case of the Legends of Pixelia soundtrack, Sebastian tried to capture that old school 8-bit vibe and combined it with more modern techniques of electronic music production. So creating the soundtrack for a retro style game was a new experience for him. He enjoys producing the music for Legends of Pixelia and both of us hope you like it.<br/><br/><br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1207605/files/20150208224017-dungeons.gif?1423464017"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
All dungeon maps and all dungeon rooms are procedurally generated to offer a fresh experience on every run. Unlike in most roguelikes, you keep your progress in Legends of Pixelia even after death. So if you managed to beat dungeon 1 at least once, you will always be able to continue or restart your journey at dungeon 2 and so on.<br/><br/>At the current state of development there are two dungeons in Legends of Pixelia:
<br/><br/>
<b>(1) The Crypt</b>

As well as The Crypt, the Winged Cave has three stages and three bosses.<br/><br/>More dungeons will be added over the process of development. I'd love to release the final version of Legends of Pixelia with six or more dungeons and the typical ""normal, nightmare, hell"" or ""new game+, new game++"" mechanics that you know from other action RPGs. :-) <br/><br/><br/>

Your cute little pixelated heroes! I like the feeling of constant progress, that's why I decided to let the heroes in Legends of Pixelia be real ones: Your characters can level up, choose stat points, change equipment and they are saved and can be played over multiple gaming sessions. <br/><br/>You won't even lose progress when dying (just some EXP). Too easy for you? You have the option to create hardcore heroes - those will stay dead once they die.<br/><br/>At the current state of development there are three hero classes in Legends of Pixelia:

<br/>More hero classes will be added to the game over the process of development. Since four is the maximum number of players in multiplayer, at least four different hero classes would be nice for the final version of Legends of Pixelia to add some variety.<br/><br/><br/>

There are multiple ways of how to increase your hero's power in Legends of Pixelia. One of them is leveling up your hero and choosing stat points. There is a choice of 5 different stat “packages”:<br/>
• <b>Melee</b>: Increases your <span style=""color: #0049ff;""><b>(X)</b></span> skill damage and 2x your hit points<br/>

either pick one of two randomly generated items or to pick gold: <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1207758/files/20150209002744-New_Item.gif?1423470464"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>The blacksmith can upgrade your already equipped items in exchange for gold and item durability:<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1207760/files/20150209002836-Blacksmith_Upgrade.gif?1423470516"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>I can't wait to see how you folks out there build your hero.

A PvP match consists of multiple rounds. A round starts with all players
 alive, each one in a corner of a randomly generated room. The last 
surviving player or team gains one point and wins the round. The first 
player or team that has 5 points wins the match. The duration of a match
 with equally skilled players should be around 10 to 20 minutes.<br/><br/>There are three different PvP modes in Legends of Pixelia at the current state of development:<br/><br/>

Welcome to Legends of Pixelia's IndieGoGo page! I am glad you made it this far.So what is this all about? Legends of Pixelia is an action role-playing game that combines retro  
pixelart with modern gameplay mechanics. Tired of left-clicking through 
 hordes of brainless one-hit-KO enemies? Random dungeons, precise  
controls via gamepad (or keyboard) and a strong fighting game AI provide
  challenging encounters. Plug in some gamepads to enjoy local multiplayer coop or balanced PvP combats (1 -- 4 players).





  
""There are some gameplay elements that old school beat ‘em ups had yet to refine in the early days, and many modern players now lean towards more actionable experiences. The upcoming Legends of Pixelia looks to combine the best of both worlds.""
Luke Siuty 




  
""Legends of Pixelia is an excellent pixel art action RPG with gameplay reminiscent of The Binding of Isaac, but with more tactical combat, persistent upgrades and local multiplayer.""
Calum Fraser

So if you managed to beat dungeon 1 at least once, you will always be able to continue or restart your journey at dungeon 2 and so on.At the current state of development there are two dungeons in Legends of Pixelia:

(1) The Crypt

An unholy place full of undeads. The Crypt has three stages, each one ending in a boss fight.

(2) Winged Cave

A cave inhabited mostly by flying enemies. As well as The Crypt, the Winged Cave has three stages and three bosses.More dungeons will be added over the process of development. I'd love to release the final version of Legends of Pixelia with six or more dungeons and the typical ""normal, nightmare, hell"" or ""new game+, new game++"" mechanics that you know from other action RPGs. :-) 

Your cute little pixelated heroes! I like the feeling of constant progress, that's why I decided to let the heroes in Legends of Pixelia be real ones: Your characters can level up, choose stat points, change equipment and they are saved and can be played over multiple gaming sessions. You won't even lose progress when dying (just some EXP). Too easy for you? You have the option to create hardcore heroes - those will stay dead once they die.At the current state of development there are three hero classes in Legends of Pixelia:






Knight
Noble fighter, fast attacks, easy combos
(X): Sky Slash
(B): Sword Blast
(Y): Shield Dash
-





Barbarian
Powerful fighter, strong skills, slow attacks
(X): Shockwave
(B): Throw Axe
(Y): Whirlwind
-





Paladin
Blessed fighter, ranged magic, crowd control
(X): Force Nova
(B): Spirit
(Y): Holy Cross
    



More hero classes will be added to the game over the process of development. Since four is the maximum number of players in multiplayer, at least four different hero classes would be nice for the final version of Legends of Pixelia to add some variety.

There are multiple ways of how to increase your hero's power in Legends of Pixelia. One of them is leveling up your hero and choosing stat points. There is a choice of 5 different stat “packages”:
• Melee: Increases your (X) skill damage and 2x your hit points
• Ranged: +(B) skill damage, +all damage, +heal per room
• Special: +(Y) skill damage, +all damage, +defense
• Offensive: +3x all damage
• Defensive: +hit points, +defense, +heal per roomEvery time you put 5 stat points into the same package, you gain access to a passive skill:Another way to build the stats of your hero is by choosing the right equipment and by upgrading your items. Every dungeon stage has a treasure room with a giant treasure chest inside of it:When opening a big treasure chest, your hero has the choice to 
either pick one of two randomly generated items or to pick gold: The blacksmith can upgrade your already equipped items in exchange for gold and item durability:I can't wait to see how you folks out there build your hero. It will be interesting to see if some crazy theorycrafters will start playing around with the stats, trying to break the game's balance. :-) 

A PvP match consists of multiple rounds. A round starts with all players

surviving player or team gains one point and wins the round. The first 
player or team that has 5 points wins the match. The duration of a match

<i>DragonQuest</i> History</h3>
<p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/1268778/homepage/name/homepage.jpg?type=sn"" src="""" style=""""/>The <i>DragonQuest</i> role-playing game was first published by
Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI), a wargame/boardgame publisher,
in 1980.  The game won the Origins award for Best Role-Playing Game,
and it looked like it might become a serious competitor as a fantasy
role-playing game, but SPI went bankrupt in 1982.  There were only a
handful of commercial adventures ever produced for the game. 
(<a href=""http://grognard.com/info1/dqmanifest.html#Adventures"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">http://grognard.com/info1/dqmanifest.html#Adventures</a>)</p>
<p><i>DragonQuest </i>has a base of fans throughout the world who
continue to play the game.</p>
<p>This project will lead to the production of a new adventure for
<i>DragonQuest</i> (though GMs who play other RPGs can certainly
adapt it to their preferred systems).</p>
<h3 class=""western"">Our Story</h3>
<p>The project designer has already produced one independent
supplement for the game, as well as one previous <a href=""https://rthorm.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=167"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">adventure</a> that was
released a number of years ago.  This project is a labor of love, not
something that would likely be commercially viable.  There is little
awareness of <i>DragonQuest</i>, the game is long out-of-print, and
the audience is small, but hopefully still dedicated.</p>
<p>Contributors can sign up to be playtesters or can choose other
perks being offered to help support the development of the project,
as well as to have a voice in the direction of the adventure.  Even the 
name of the adventure is open at this point, so if you'd like to be 
involved in this project, join in!</p><p>To engage with the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">DragonQuest</span> community, and to make this
something that will be useful to groups playing the game, there will
be regular status updates and discussion of the project posted here
and at the project page
(<a href=""https://rthorm.wordpress.com/the-wilderness-of-a/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://rthorm.wordpress.com/the-wilderness-of-a/</a>).
 
</p>
<h3 class=""western"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Supporters who contribute at least $25 will get an electronic copy
of the finished adventure, and will have it at least 6 months before
the adventure is released in other formats.  Eventually, the
adventure will probably be available through a sales site like
DriveThruRPG, but contributors will be able to have it well before
then.<br/><br/>There are also opportunities to get a hardcopy of the
adventure.  These will almost certainly be very limited
editions.  Copies of ""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Poor Brendan's Almanac</span>,"" a
supplement for <i>DragonQuest</i> that has never before been
available in print, will also be available as a special premium for
contributors.  All hardcopy printed premiums will be 8 1/2""
x 11"" size Print-On-Demand saddle-stiched books with full-color
covers and black-and-white interiors with illustrations. 
(Non-US contributors will have to pay an additional international
postage premium for shipping. International postage premium should
hopefully only be a maximum of $10.)</p>
<p>There isn't much needed in the way of resources or material to
create an adventure for a role-playing game.  The main thing
that is needed is time, and having these funds will allow me to spend
some time on this project.</p>
<h3 class=""western"" style="""">Special Perks</h3>
<p>There are a lot of opportunities for special perks for people who
are really interested in supporting this idea and in helping to
customize it.  If you really want to see new rules for a new
Skill or a new College of Magic, there are opportunities to sponsor
those to be included in the finished adventure.  The names for
the different levels of perks (Mercenary, Adventurer, and Hero)
correspond to the three levels for characters in the game.</p><p>Custom perks are also possible, if there's a different level of interaction and contribution you want to have with this project, just get in touch, and we'll discuss what you have in mind.  </p><p><br/></p><p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gw2dWyPrtVA/TrcTCNq9qnI/AAAAAAAAE2k/luMX7IJwEbQ/s320/Sven+Chronicles+1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<h3 class=""western"" style="""">Funding Goals</h3>
<p>I'm going with the flexible funding model, because this project
will go ahead, whether or not the goal is met.  I appreciate the
support of those who have already said they would help to fund this
project, and I want to reward those who do participate with the
opportunity to have this adventure before it is released more widely.</p>
<p>If the basic goal is met, this will be at least a 16-page
adventure (plus maps, charts, etc.); if it surpasses the basic goal
and reaches <b>$1500</b>, the adventure will be at least a 32-page
adventure.  If the goal is not reached, the adventure will still be
produced, but in a more limited fashion.</p><p>Because we're using flexible funding for this project, work will be going on during the fundraiser, and the project completion target is the end of March 2012.<br/></p>
<p><i>Two additional incentives to encourage you to contribute:</i></p><p><i>First, if we reach the initial goal by
<span style=""text-decoration: none;""><b>December 15</b></span>, I
will allocate time to this immediately so that a draft playtest
version will be available by December 25 (assuming that a lot of old
players might be gathering during the holidays).</i></p><p><i>Second, if we raise at least $2000, I will also commit to producing a sequel adventure to </i>The Water Works<i> by the end of 2012.  This adventure was another one of the proposed adventure ideas that was discussed for this project, and there are already some sketch ideas for this.  No additional contributions are required, and everyone who contributes to this project will also receive a copy of </i>The Earth Works<i> if that bonus is reached.<br/></i></p>
<h3 class=""western"" style="""">Art</h3>
<p>There is also an opportunity to have a custom art component. If
support reaches <b>$3000</b>, I will have a custom piece of cover art
commissioned from Timothy Truman (the artist who did the cover art
for Enchanted Wood; Iï¿½ve been in brief contact with him, and it
looks like it would be possible to commission him for a piece). That
might also end up being a separate crowd funding project, rather than
rolling it into the adventure fundraiser. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sites.google.com/site/fantasyillustrator/_/rsrc/1304908990196/home/the%20weapon%20%28Large%29.jpg?height=320&amp;width=320"" src="""" style=""""/>I was going

<p>Yes, as someone commented in the early discussion about this
project, it's a lot to pay for an adventure, especially for one for a
long out-of-print role-playing game.  If all you want is to buy
a new adventure, there are lots of other options available to you. 
This is as much to provide some support for the game and to show that
there is still a community of players who play the game.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you only want to contribute a small amount, your name will
still be listed among the contributors acknowledgments (unless you
prefer to remain anonymous).</p>
<p>It will also be hugely helpful that everyone spread the word about
this project.  <i>DragonQuest</i> has always been a niche game, and
the fan base of potential supporters is really small.  Sharing
information about this project with others will help us reach the
people who will be interested in knowing about this and supporting
it.</p>

<h3>My Journey!</h3>
<p>In 2010 I set out on a journey to qualify for the London Olympic games as a swimmer for my native country of Portugal. I dropped everything going on in my life, career, house, friends and moved to Arizona to train full time.</p>
<p>Along the way I picked up Crossfit to better prepare me to reach my goal.</p>
<p>This year I entered the Crossfit Open as a fun experience to be part of a team with Urban Warfit, the gym where I train at.</p>
<p>Today I find myself as an individual qualifier for the Southwest Region Crossfit Games, in a position to fight for a spot at this year's Crossfit Games in California.</p>
<p>(You can read a more detailed account of my journey in a recent article published by Crossfit games written by Emily Warren: <a href=""http://games.crossfit.com/article/faster-land-and-water-hannah-caldas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://games.crossfit.com/article/faster-land-a...</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why this Campaign?</h3>
<p>No ""self discovery"" journey is without trials and tribulations, and mine is no exception. I have encountered physical, psychological and financial challenges along the way.</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is two fold really. It serves to assist to a degree some of the financial challenges that I am coming across (by your donations), but also the psychological by letting me know that people believe in the importance of my journey.</p>
<p>The donations will help fund my trip to Colorado for the competition, as well as the preparation leading up to the competition (altitude training, equipment, etc).</p>
<p>I named the suggested donations as traditional Crossfit movements, in the spirit of Crossfit. I will be documenting the journey in Colorado (blog, pictures and video) and sharing as a thank you for anyone who contributes.</p>
<p>(Any donation helps and is appreciated, you don't need to follow the suggested ones.)</p>

(You can read a more detailed account of my journey in a recent article published by Crossfit games written by Emily Warren: http://games.crossfit.com/article/faster-land-a...


Why this Campaign?
No ""self discovery"" journey is without trials and tribulations, and mine is no exception. I have encountered physical, psychological and financial challenges along the way.
The goal of this campaign is two fold really. It serves to assist to a degree some of the financial challenges that I am coming across (by your donations), but also the psychological by letting me know that people believe in the importance of my journey.
The donations will help fund my trip to Colorado for the competition, as well as the preparation leading up to the competition (altitude training, equipment, etc).
I named the suggested donations as traditional Crossfit movements, in the spirit of Crossfit. I will be documenting the journey in Colorado (blog, pictures and video) and sharing as a thank you for anyone who contributes.
(Any donation helps and is appreciated, you don't need to follow the suggested ones.)

<p>BetBudz is the brainchild of Gino Khoury and Daniel Stroll. We created BetBudz out of our own desire to make wagers against friends for games we already played consistently.</p>
<p>When hanging out together, we were already making friendly wagers - whether deciding the better 8-ball pool player, or the superior QuizUp Trivia king. We needed a way to make things more exciting. Gino felt he was the best, so we asked him to put his money where his mouth was -- ten minutes later, he was buying lunch for his buddies!</p>
<p><i>The truth is, mobile gaming is fun, but increasing the stakes against your friends is even more fun!</i> And that’s why we created BetBudz, to make your gaming experience even better.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>How it Works</h3> <p></p>We designed BetBudz to be super simple to use. Open the app, select a friend, challenge them to a game, and set the wager, be it real money or Bitz. </div><div>

<h3>Where We Are in the Process and Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our app is designed and is in the process of being developed. We should have a functional beta version in the next month.</p>
<p>Why we’ve turned to the crowdfunding community is because our app requires more permits than the average app, and to get up and running we need help with funding.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Wagering on Games of Skill</h3>
<p>Many people ask us ""is this considered gambling""? The simple answer is no. BetBudz allows users only to wager on games of skill, not games of chance.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The following risks and challenges currently exist:</p>
<p><b>Integrating with games: </b><br/>We are working with our development team to ensure every mobile game available is playable on our platform.</p>
<p><b>Matching up new users: </b><br/>Part of why we are launching on Indiegogo is to gauge interest and ensure we have a healthy user base on launch!</p>
<p><b>Making sure everything is a level playing field/you’re playing your own skill level: </b><br/>We are working with our development team on an algorithm to ensure when meeting new buddies, they are at the same skill level as you.</p>

   How it Works We designed BetBudz to be super simple to use. Open the app, select a friend, challenge them to a game, and set the wager, be it real money or Bitz. 



 Setting up a game against friends is easy!
