<h3>A different kind of How To...</h3>Over the years, I've received countless mails, asking me for advice on certain technical aspects of writing a novel.

The problem was that the market had been saturated with thousands of these books already, most written by industry A-Listers.<br/><br/>I then took a look at the online video tutorials, and although there are a few good ones available in that space, they all seemed to follow the same pattern: They give you the theory of all the different elements that goes into a novel, but fall short when it comes to the practical side of implementing that theory into your own work.<br/><br/>The idea for the Online Video Course was born when I sat down to plan my next novel, <i>The Entity.</i>  I realized that I could use this opportunity to help others by recording the entire process from conception to publishing, showing aspiring authors exactly how I go about planning, plotting, writing and self-publishing a full-length novel. The course is structured in such a way that if the viewer follows the process discussed in each video, that they would end up writing and self-publishing their novels <b><i>WITH</i></b>  me instead of just working through endless theory.<br/><br/>Your contribution today would not only mean that I can achieve my goal of building this online video course, but also help aspiring authors all over the world, to reach their dream of writing and publishing their own novels. <br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>What topics will the course cover?<br/>
</h3>Because this is not a standard HOW TO WRITE course where I just tell you about creating characters and plotting, etc., I would need a few days in structuring the course outline. Check back every now and again, and feel free to throw in your comments and suggestions as well.<p><br/></p>
<p>That said, there is not one single thing that I will do for <i>The Entity</i> that I will not disclose with the viewers. Everything from naming the characters to foreshadowing to planning the perfect ending will be looked at and discussed.<br/></p>

<p>As a motivation to keep myself accountable for eventually getting back to the project, I commissioned a graphic designer (the same one who created the covers for <i>Son of Perdition</i>, <i>Incubus </i>and <i>Succubus</i>) to create the cover for me so long. <br/></p>

Some praise for my novel, The Son of Perdition:



A different kind of How To...Over the years, I've received countless mails, asking me for advice on certain technical aspects of writing a novel. As I answered the mails, I thought about creating a HOW-TO guide about writing one. The problem was that the market had been saturated with thousands of these books already, most written by industry A-Listers.I then took a look at the online video tutorials, and although there are a few good ones available in that space, they all seemed to follow the same pattern: They give you the theory of all the different elements that goes into a novel, but fall short when it comes to the practical side of implementing that theory into your own work.The idea for the Online Video Course was born when I sat down to plan my next novel, The Entity.  I realized that I could use this opportunity to help others by recording the entire process from conception to publishing, showing aspiring authors exactly how I go about planning, plotting, writing and self-publishing a full-length novel.

What topics will the course cover?
Because this is not a standard HOW TO WRITE course where I just tell you about creating characters and plotting, etc., I would need a few days in structuring the course outline. Check back every now and again, and feel free to throw in your comments and suggestions as well.
That said, there is not one single thing that I will do for The Entity that I will not disclose with the viewers. Everything from naming the characters to foreshadowing to planning the perfect ending will be looked at and discussed.



Tell me more about The Entity
After writing The Incubus and Succubus books, I still felt that I didn't go as ""scary"" as I would have liked. Something kept nagging at me, challenging me to try and write the scariest story that I could, but because of other commitments, I only had time to give the story a title before shelving it under my TO DO list.
As a motivation to keep myself accountable for eventually getting back to the project, I commissioned a graphic designer (the same one who created the covers for Son of Perdition, Incubus and Succubus) to create the cover for me so long. 
With some money now invested into the book, I knew that I could no longer abandon the story, and it was just a matter of time before I would put pen to paper again.

Well, ladies and gentlemen... that time is now...






What I need to get this done
 I've set the funding limit to $8,000 mainly for time and resources. I would require equipment (microphone, video recorder, etc) in order to create the course, but my main reason behind this campaign is for my time. I would need to set aside three to five months in order to create, edit and publish everything. That's three to five months that I can't promote my own work or tackle other projects (like ghost writing stories for other authors, etc.).
In return for your generous assistance, I have created a few exciting perks that I think might be worth looking at. Check it out and see if there's something in particular you'd like.



What happens if you raise less than $8k?
The show still goes on! It might take a few months longer to reach my final goal, but you can rest assured that both The Entity and the Write and Publish a Novel with Me video course will see the light of day in 2016.



What happens when you raise more than $8k?If that happens, I will re-invest the funds into other writer-related video courses as well as begin working on a Writer's App that I currently have brewing in the planning phase.
 

  


Risks & ChallengesAs with all things in life, there are certain risks and challenges that could hinder any project, regardless of how ""fool proof"" you think it might be. I could break my wrist, for example, which could delay the project with a few weeks or months even. A burglar might break into my home while my family and I are asleep and steal my laptop. That's happened before.  Regardless of anything that might go wrong, I WILL finish the video course, and I WILL  finish writing The Entity.I will ensure that I make daily backups (onsite and offsite) of everything I do so that I can stick to my 3 to 4-month goal limit. If I break my wrist, I will use dictation software to write the book. Either way, one way or another, this project will get completed.
  


No Cash? No Worries! You can still help!

Ci siamo conosciuti su Twitter, e da un semplice follow alla pagina di Wastad è nata una storia di complicità e rispetto sfociata nella condivisione di questo progetto. 
Nastassya si concentra sugli aspetti della comunicazione, spirito creativo del gruppo, eccellente videomaker e copywriter si integra in modo complementare a Luca più dedito alla programmazione front-end e alla user experience; ogni suono prima di essere approvato passa da lui.

Perché ti conviene contribuire se sei un'azienda che investe nella pubblicità online?

Chi decide di promuovere il proprio brand con noi, prima di tutto sa cosa significa lasciare i propri spazi agli utenti, sa che l’attenzione si guadagna coinvolgendo e non “martellando”. 
Wastad unisce la gamification all'advertising, passando per l'ecologia, grazie a supporti rigorosamente usa e getta.
Chi decide di utilizzare la nostra piattaforma è cosciente anche dei seguenti vantaggi:

La fruizione non invasiva dei contenuti pubblicitari garantisce una percezione positiva del brand
La visualizzazione a schermo intero su smartphone e tablet, senza disturbare, permette di creare un impatto coinvolgente e chiaro migliorando l’interazione e l’efficacia del messaggio pubblicitario
L’alta profilazione degli utenti, attraverso il loro consenso, l’integrazione di open data o di dati in possesso dei nostri inserzionisti aumenta la rilevanza e la pertinenza della pubblicità
L’interazione umana - l’utente deve effettuare la scansione per interagire - è un sistema efficace per garantire visualizzazioni reali e non contaminate da bot.com
La piattaforma non è esposta a software che blocchino la pubblicità (AdBlock)
L’alta diffusione dei supporti (box della pizza, carta igienica…) garantisce un elevato potenziale di traffico in quanto sono supporti di uso quotidiano, basti pensare che andiamo in bagno dalle 6/8 volte al giorno
Viewability ( la viewability è la metrica con cui le piattaforme pubblicitarie ti garantiscono la presenza di una pubblicità di fronte ad un essere umano), nel nostro caso la visualizzazione è 99,9% consapevole.

Siamo convinti che pagare le campagne un tot a CPM equivale a buttare dei volantini per strada e sperare che qualcuno si fermi a leggerli. Buttane 1000, uno viene letto e buttato nel cestino. Questo è il CTR spiegato a mia nonna. CTR medio in Italia pari a 0,01% (fonte CTR medio : Doubleclick 04-2015).
La nostra modalità di pagamento è detta “Pay x scan” perché l’inserzionista ci paga quando l’utente effettua una scansione del QR. Puntiamo sulla qualità quindi più dati verranno richiesti per associare messaggio e pubblico più sarà la tariffa da pagare ( da 0, 20€ a 0,60€ + iva )
La pubblicità invade gli spazi delle persone ed è per questo motivo che risulta fastidiosa. Il mantra nel settore della pubblicità online oggi è garantire il contenuto giusto, alla persona giusta, al momento giusto, partendo da quest’ultimo aspetto crediamo che nessuno meglio dell’utente stesso conosca il momento migliore. Con noi potrà decidere quando cogliere le sue opportunità. Le persone nei momenti di relax potranno vivere un’esperienza personalizzata in modo spensierato rimanendo sorpresi e appagati dall’affinità dei contenuti pubblicitari grazie all’utilizzo dei dati ottenuti consensualmente quando si registrano e utilizzano la nostra app. Diamo la libertà di lasciarsele sfuggire da sotto il naso.

Perché ti conviene contribuire se sei un'azienda che produce carta igienica, sacchi immondizia o cartoni della pizza?



L’altro importante valore del nostro progetto è quello di coinvolgere i produttori di beni di largo consumo, infatti condividiamo i nostri guadagni con i produttori che decidono di diventare nostri partner stampando il nostro QR insieme alla loro grafica.
Conosciamo bene la situazione dei produttori di beni di largo consumo, fai attenzione a questo video così potrai capire il potenziale nascosto che hai se fai parte di questo settore:

Background*

Turkey is an emerging regional superpower at a critical point in its
history, with much at stake. The ostensible initial economic and political
success of the AKP, in power since 2002, is giving way to a more fraught
situation in which the economy is faltering, the Kurdish peace process has
broken down, terrorism is increasing, regional pressures are mounting –
including fallout from the war in neighbouring Syria - and the ruling AKP is
becoming increasingly authoritarian. 
Under the AKP, local and national authorities have
repeatedly intervened in football as it is seen as one of the most effective
ways to influence people and boost political and business prospects in Turkey.
Football is also seen by some as a site of rebellion, in which they can challenge racism, homophobia, sexism, and express political alternatives to the government.

The authorities have clamped down hard on dissenting football
fans; banning political chanting
at matches, introducing the controversial Passolig e-ticketing system, forming
and supporting pro-government supporter groups, and even charging football fans
with trying to mount a coup d’etat in the wake of the 2013 Gezi Park protests,
in which fans of different football teams set aside their fierce rivalries to
join forces and play a prominent role in the anti-government demonstrations. 


The politicisation of Turkish football has also contributed

The first journal insert is the ""Inspire"" version, appropriate for anyone interested in making their life as meaningful as possible.  Future versions will be targeted to specific purposes and audiences. 




I asked an experienced group of world travelers, artists and entrepreneurs to share what they journal about to build the Lucid Note.

The youngest person to climb Mt. Everest as well as NFL and Olympic  athletes and coaches share prompts that will lead to improved mental clarity. 


Travel writers share prompts and quotes that will inspire you to look beyond the usual when recording your travels.
A world-class fashion designer shares wisdom about finding your purpose for life and creative endeavors. 
Everyday entrepreneurs share suggestions that will inspire you to look for ways that you can solve problems and add value to the world.















After a rather directionless youth, a confluence of circumstances led to my being passionately interested in self-development; I not only wanted to reach my own greatest potential but I wanted to be instrumental in helping other people attain theirs.



I found that I kept writing about similar ideas, regardless of who I interviewed or studied. It occurred to me that these ideas could be the cornerstones to an inspirational journal. If I turned these ideas into prompts, that would help me, or whoever has the notebook, think like the thought leaders of the day. 






Every aspect of this business has been well thought out. You can be assured that your help on this campaign plays a crucial role in the foundation of a great company. Our mission is to inspire the adventurous, creative and entrepreneurial spark in all of us.



In May, as I was graduating from college, the first version of the Lucid Note was handwritten.



A small group beta-tested the concept. Responses were enthusiastically positive. We decided it was worth testing on a bigger scale. 
We went to the high-end leather manufacturer of my prized journal cover and ordered our first run of 50 Lucid Notes. I paid for these prototypes out of my personal savings with a little bit of trepidation and a LOT of excitement! 
I couldn’t wait to get my product out to a larger audience! I brought them to a youth leadership camp I volunteer at in the summer. At first, I had to explain what the notebook was all about. By the end of the week, I had people coming up to me and asking for one! This was when I realized the Lucid Note was something special. 




My goal with this product is to help the user become more adventurous, creative, and entrepreneurial - to develop to their fullest potential in alignment with their deepest dreams and desires.

Risks and challenges
Although it is our goal to get it in your hands as soon as possible, please understand that setbacks do arise in terms of manufacturing and shipping.
All we ask for in advance is patience and that backers respond to the information survey as quickly as possible after this campaign ends so we can get your journal in your hands ASAP.


    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Please help get the word out and make some noise about the campaign.

<p>Како пролазе дисиденти у Србији?</p>
<p>Ја сам Андреј Фајгељ и усудио сам се да мислим својом главом.</p>
<p>Због тога сам прогресивно избациван из јавности. Из организација које сам оснивао, са пројеката које сам водио, из новина у којима сам објављивао најчитаније чланке а сада не смеју да ме објављују.</p>
<p>На крају ми је остало последње уточиште слободе, оно што би свако од нас требало да има, мој дом и мој простор на интернету. </p>
<p>Кад сам имао шта да кажем, своје мишљење сам изразио у свом дому, својим речима, снимио на свом рачунару и објавио на свом блогу и својим друштвеним мрежама. Свој на своме. Никоме нисам куцао на врата. Али мени јесу покуцали на врата. </p>
<p>У наш дом упале су специјалне полицијске снаге, одузеле моје рачунаре, одвеле ме пред мојом децом и стрпале ме у затвор.</p>
<p>Вучић је лагао: ""Ни у једној земљи не би био пуштен. Ни у једној земљи на свету. Ни у једној земљи на свету. Дакле од Аргентине до Канаде, од Аустралије до Русије и скандинавских земаља, нигде никада не би био пуштен.""</p>
<p>Писао сам амбасадама поменутих земаља, и другима, питајући да ли је истина да бих у њиховим земљама због критике Вучића и НАТО на Фејсбуку био ухапшен и никада не бих био пуштен. Нисам добио одговор.</p>
<p>Либерали су толики фолиранти. Нама овде тиранин може главе да сече. Док су њихови интереси заштићени, они ће бити задовољни. Вредности, демократија, људска права, слободе, с тим се они само исмевају.</p>
<p>Мени није смешно. И даље ми као државном непријатељу прети пет година затвора. Још увек ми не враћају рачунаре.</p>
<p>Покушао сам да се снађем. Купио сам на кредит неки лошији рачунар. Међутим и он се, под мистериозним околностима, покватио. Такође, мистериозно ми је оборен и блог. Мени је рачунар и средство за рад. Тако да ми је поред националног рада угрожен и професионални рад и постоји опасност да останем без посла.</p>
<p>Ако останем без посла, остаћу и без овог дома, и са четворо деце ћу завршити на улици.</p>
<p><b>Ето тако пролазе дисиденти у Србији.</b> Врата затворена, руке везане, уста запушена, судбина запечаћена.</p>
<p>Да ја говорим само против Вучића, не бих имао проблема. Постоје многи опозиционари који имају и финансије и пролаз у медије и сваку другу подршку. Мој проблем је што говорим против либерално-прогресивне догме која стоји и иза Вучића и иза НАТО и иза глобализма.</p>
<p>Они имају сву подршку и они раде за оног ко их плаћа, а коме да се обратимо ми који пристајемо да радимо само за свој народ? Ко је народ?</p>
<p>Народ си ти. И ја само теби могу да се обратим.</p>
<p>У поквареном рачунару је остао нацрт књиге чији наслов је „После Вучића“. У тој књизи објашњавам како је могуће сменити не само Вучића већ и либерално-прогресивну догму која стоји иза њега. Уколико се то не уради, после Вучића долази Вучић.</p>
<p>Ако желиш да књига буде објављена, можеш бити приложник или претплатник. Уплатом одређених средстава на динарски рачун из Србије или онјлајн плаћањем на платформи Индигого.</p>
<p>Знам да немате новца као ни ми. Знам да се и друге породице налазе пред опасношћу да заврше на улици. Знам да су и бољи људи и горе пролазили радећи за народ. Знам да постоје и прече потребе.</p>
<p>Али исто тако знам да народ може бити слободан само ако се за слободу бори. Наш српски народ је и у најцрњим данима турског ропства имао хајдуке који су били кадри стићи, утећи, и на страшном месту постојати. Који су били спремни да се боре за слободу против империје. Али ни хајдуци нису могли без јатака.</p>
<p>Ја хоћу и могу да се борим. Могу да објавим књигу пре избора и утичем да се ствари промене. Али без подршке руке су ми везане. Овај пут се не питам ја. Ви ћете одлучили да ли је ово моја последња објава или сам тек почео.</p>
<p>Помоћи ћете ми ако проширите ову вест. Помоћи ћете ми ако уплатите један динар.</p>

<p>What happens to dissidents in Serbia?</p>
<p>I am Andrej Fajgelj and I deared to think for myself.</p>
<p>For that, I was ""progressively"" banished from public life. From the organizations that I've founded, projects that I’ve led, f<span style=""background-color: initial;"">rom the newspapers I’ve written some of the most popular articles for and which
now don't dare to publish me.</span></p>
<p>In the end, all I was left with was the last refuge of freedom, which each of us should have, my home and my space on the Internet. When I had something to say, I voiced my opinion in my own home, in my own words, recorded it on my own computer and published it on my own blog and my own social network accounts. I knocked on no doors. But someone did knock on my door.</p>
<p>Our home was raided by special police forces, they seized my computers, arrested me in front of my children and put me in jail.</p>
<p>Vucic lied: ""No other country would release him. No country in the world. No country in the world. From Argentina to Canada, from Australia to Russia and Scandinavian countries no one would never ever release him.""</p>
<p>I wrote to the embassies of the countries mentioned, and others, asking if it was true that in their countries I would be arrested for criticizing Vucic and NATO on Facebook, never to be released. I got no answer.</p>
<p>Liberals are so fake! Here, the tyrant might as well cut off our heads. As long as their interests are protected, they will be satisfied. Values, democracy, human rights, freedoms, they are making fun of all that.</p>
<p>I don’t find that funny. As a public enemy, I am still facing five years in prison. They are still withholding my computers.</p>
<p>I tried to get along. I took out credit to buy a lower quality computer. But it broke down under mysterious circumstances. My blog mysteriously went down as well.</p>
<p>The computer is also my work equipment. Besides my public activity, my professional activity is at risk, and I'm in danger of losing my job. If I lose my job, I will lose my home, and end up homeless with four children.</p>
<p><b>This is what happens to dissidents in Serbia.</b> Doors closed, hands tied, mouth closed, fate sealed.</p>
<p>If I spoke only against Vucic, I would have no problems. Many members of the opposition have finances and media coverage and all other support. My problem is that I am speaking against the liberal-progressive dogma that stands behind Vucic and behind NATO and behind globalism.</p>
<p>They have all the support and they work for those who are paying them, but to whom can we turn, we who agree only to work for our own people? Who is the people?</p>
<p>The people is you. You are the only one I can turn to.</p>
<p>In the broken computer, I had a draft of a book titled ""After Vucic"". In this book, I am explaining how it is possible to replace not only Vucic but also the liberal-progressive dogma that lies behind him. If this is not done, after Vucic, there will be Vucic.</p>
<p>If you want the book to be published, you can become a donor or a subscriber by paying into the Serbian bank account or online through Indiegogo.</p>
<p>I know that like us, you don’t have no money. I know that other families too are facing the danger of ending in the street. I know that better people have endured worse things for working for people. I know that there are more urgent needs.</p>
<p>But I also know that only the people fighting for freedom can be free. Even in the darkest days of the Ottoman occupation, our Serbian people had hajduks who were “able to accost, to evade and to endure on terrible place”. Who were willing to fight for freedom against the empire. But even hajduks couldn’t exist without support.</p>
<p>I want to fight and I can. I can publish the book before the elections and make a difference. But without support my hands are tied. It is not up to me this time. You will decide if this is my last announcement, or if I have just started.</p>
<p>You will help me if you share this news. You will help me if you donate one cent.</p>
<p>Because each cent from one’s own people is worth more than millions from foreign powers.</p>

Quel est le destin des dissidents en Serbie?<p></p>
<p>Je suis Andrej Fajgelj et j’ai osé penser librement.</p>
<p>A cause de cela, j’étais progressivement banni de la vie publique :

des organisations que j’ai fondées, des projets que j’ai menés, des journaux, pour lesquels j’écrivais des articles les plus lus et qui n’osent plus me publier.</p>
<p>Finalement, j’étais réduit au dernier refuge de la liberté, celui que nous devrions tous avoir, ma maison familiale, et mon espace sur internet.

Quand j’ai eu quelque chose à dire, j’ai exprimé mon opinion chez moi, avec mes propres mots, je l’ai enregistré sur mon ordinateur et publié sur mon blog et mes réseaux sociaux.

Soi-même chez soi. Je n’ai pas frappé à la porte de personne. Mais on a frappé à la mienne.</p>
<p>Notre maison a été perquisitionnée par les forces spéciales de la police,

ils ont saisi mes ordinateurs, m'ont arrêté devant mes enfants et m’ont mis en détention.</p>
<p>Vucic mentait: «En aucun pays il ne serait pas libéré. Aucun pays au monde. Aucun pays au monde.

De l’Argentine au Canada, de l’Australie à la Russie et aux pays scandinaves,

il ne serait libéré nulle part, jamais.
»</p>
<p>J’ai écrit aux ambassades des pays mentionnés, et aux autres,

en demandant s’il était vrai que dans leurs pays 


je serais arrêté pour avoir critiqué Vucic et l’OTAN sur Facebook, et je ne serais libéré jamais.

Je n’ai pas eu de réponse.</p>
<p>Quels hypocrites ces libéraux !

Ici, le tyran peut bien couper nos têtes.

Tant que leurs intérêts sont protégés, ils sont contents.

Valeurs, démocratie, droits de l’homme, libertés, ils s’en moquent de tout ça.</p>
<p>Ça ne me fait pas rigoler.

En tant qu’ennemi public, je risque toujours cinq ans de prison ferme.

Ils retiennent toujours mes ordinateurs.</p>
<p>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">J’ai essayé de me débrouiller. J’ai acheté un ordinateur moins performant à crédit. 

Mais il est tombé en panne dans des conditions mystérieuses.

Mon blog est aussi mystérieusement en panne.</span><br/>
</p>
<p>Mon ordinateur est aussi un outil de travail.

En plus de l’activisme, mon activité professionnelle se trouve menacée aussi,

et le danger de perdre mon emploi est réel.

Si je perds mon emploi je perdrai ma maison,

et je finirai à la rue avec quatre enfants.</p>
<p>
<b>Tel est le destin des dissidents en Serbie.</b>

Portes fermées, mains liées, bouche scotchée, sort scellé.</p>
<p>Si je ne parlais que contre Vucic, je n’aurais pas de problèmes.

De nombreux membres de l’opposition ont les finances

et la couverture médiatique et tout autre soutien.

Mon problème est de parler contre le dogme libéral-progressiste qui se trouve derrière Vucic et l’OTAN et le mondialisme.</p>
<p>Ils ont tout le soutien et ils travaillent pour quiconque les paye. Mais à qui s’adresser si on n’accepte de travailler que pour son peuple ?

Qui est le peuple ?</p>
<p>Le peuple c’est toi.

Et tu es le seul auquel je peux m’adresser.</p>
<p>Dans l’ordinateur en panne est resté un brouillon d’un livre intitule « Après Vucic ».

Dans ce livre j’explique comment on peut remplacer non seulement Vucic, 

mais aussi le dogme libéral-progressiste dont il dépend.

Si cela n’est pas fait, après Vucic, nous aurons Vucic.</p>
<p>Si vous voulez que le livre soit publié, vous pouvez devenir donateur ou souscripteur 

en versant une somme au compte bancaire en Serbie

ou en ligne sur la platforme Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Je sais que, comme nous, vous n’avez pas d’argent.

Je sais que d’autres familles aussi font face au danger de finir à la rue.

Je sais que des hommes meilleurs ont enduré des choses pires pour avoir travaillé pour le peuple.

Je sais qu’il y a des besoins plus pressants.</p>
<p>Mais je sais aussi que seuls les peuples qui luttent pour la liberté peuvent être libres. 

Notre peuple serbe, même pendant les jours les plus sombres de l’esclavage Turc, avait les haïdouks, 

qui étaient capables « de parvenir, de s’évader, et d’endurer dans un endroit terrible », qui étaient prêts à lutter pour la liberté, contre l’empire. 

Mais même les haïdouks ne pouvaient pas exister sans soutien.</p>
<p>Je peux et je veux lutter. Je peux publier le livre avant les élections et contribuer à changer les choses.

Mais sans soutien mes mains sont liées. 

Cette fois cela ne dépend pas de moi. C’est vous qui décidez si celle-ci est ma dernière annonce publique, ou si je viens juste de commencer.</p>
<p>Après avoir publié ce vidéo, je retournerai l’ordinateur emprunté et je resterai encore sans internet.</p>
<p>Vous m’aiderez en partageant cet appel.

Vous m’aiderez en contribuant un centime.</p>
<p>Car chaque centime reçu de son peuple vaut plus que les millions des puissances étrangères.</p>

What happens to dissidents in Serbia?
I am Andrej Fajgelj and I deared to think for myself.
For that, I was ""progressively"" banished from public life. From the organizations that I've founded, projects that I’ve led, from the newspapers I’ve written some of the most popular articles for and which
now don't dare to publish me.

Even in the darkest days of the Ottoman occupation, our Serbian people had hajduks who were “able to accost, to evade and to endure on terrible place”. Who were willing to fight for freedom against the empire. But even hajduks couldn’t exist without support.
I want to fight and I can. I can publish the book before the elections and make a difference. But without support my hands are tied. It is not up to me this time. You will decide if this is my last announcement, or if I have just started.
You will help me if you share this news. You will help me if you donate one cent.
Because each cent from one’s own people is worth more than millions from foreign powers.

Quel est le destin des dissidents en Serbie?
Je suis Andrej Fajgelj et j’ai osé penser librement.
A cause de cela, j’étais progressivement banni de la vie publique :

des organisations que j’ai fondées, des projets que j’ai menés, des journaux, pour lesquels j’écrivais des articles les plus lus et qui n’osent plus me publier.
Finalement, j’étais réduit au dernier refuge de la liberté, celui que nous devrions tous avoir, ma maison familiale, et mon espace sur internet.

Quand j’ai eu quelque chose à dire, j’ai exprimé mon opinion chez moi, avec mes propres mots, je l’ai enregistré sur mon ordinateur et publié sur mon blog et mes réseaux sociaux.

Soi-même chez soi. Je n’ai pas frappé à la porte de personne. Mais on a frappé à la mienne.
Notre maison a été perquisitionnée par les forces spéciales de la police,

ils ont saisi mes ordinateurs, m'ont arrêté devant mes enfants et m’ont mis en détention.
Vucic mentait: «En aucun pays il ne serait pas libéré. Aucun pays au monde. Aucun pays au monde.

De l’Argentine au Canada, de l’Australie à la Russie et aux pays scandinaves,

il ne serait libéré nulle part, jamais.
»
J’ai écrit aux ambassades des pays mentionnés, et aux autres,

en demandant s’il était vrai que dans leurs pays 


je serais arrêté pour avoir critiqué Vucic et l’OTAN sur Facebook, et je ne serais libéré jamais.

Je n’ai pas eu de réponse.
Quels hypocrites ces libéraux !

Ici, le tyran peut bien couper nos têtes.

Tant que leurs intérêts sont protégés, ils sont contents.

Valeurs, démocratie, droits de l’homme, libertés, ils s’en moquent de tout ça.
Ça ne me fait pas rigoler.

En tant qu’ennemi public, je risque toujours cinq ans de prison ferme.

Ils retiennent toujours mes ordinateurs.

J’ai essayé de me débrouiller. J’ai acheté un ordinateur moins performant à crédit. 

Mais il est tombé en panne dans des conditions mystérieuses.

Mon blog est aussi mystérieusement en panne.

Mon ordinateur est aussi un outil de travail.

En plus de l’activisme, mon activité professionnelle se trouve menacée aussi,

et le danger de perdre mon emploi est réel.

Si je perds mon emploi je perdrai ma maison,

et je finirai à la rue avec quatre enfants.

Tel est le destin des dissidents en Serbie.

Portes fermées, mains liées, bouche scotchée, sort scellé.
Si je ne parlais que contre Vucic, je n’aurais pas de problèmes.

De nombreux membres de l’opposition ont les finances

et la couverture médiatique et tout autre soutien.

Mon problème est de parler contre le dogme libéral-progressiste qui se trouve derrière Vucic et l’OTAN et le mondialisme.
Ils ont tout le soutien et ils travaillent pour quiconque les paye. Mais à qui s’adresser si on n’accepte de travailler que pour son peuple ?

Qui est le peuple ?
Le peuple c’est toi.

Et tu es le seul auquel je peux m’adresser.
Dans l’ordinateur en panne est resté un brouillon d’un livre intitule « Après Vucic ».

Dans ce livre j’explique comment on peut remplacer non seulement Vucic, 

mais aussi le dogme libéral-progressiste dont il dépend.

Si cela n’est pas fait, après Vucic, nous aurons Vucic.
Si vous voulez que le livre soit publié, vous pouvez devenir donateur ou souscripteur 

en versant une somme au compte bancaire en Serbie

ou en ligne sur la platforme Indiegogo.
Je sais que, comme nous, vous n’avez pas d’argent.

Je sais que d’autres familles aussi font face au danger de finir à la rue.

Je sais que des hommes meilleurs ont enduré des choses pires pour avoir travaillé pour le peuple.

Je sais qu’il y a des besoins plus pressants.
Mais je sais aussi que seuls les peuples qui luttent pour la liberté peuvent être libres. 

Notre peuple serbe, même pendant les jours les plus sombres de l’esclavage Turc, avait les haïdouks, 

qui étaient capables « de parvenir, de s’évader, et d’endurer dans un endroit terrible », qui étaient prêts à lutter pour la liberté, contre l’empire. 

Mais même les haïdouks ne pouvaient pas exister sans soutien.
Je peux et je veux lutter. Je peux publier le livre avant les élections et contribuer à changer les choses.

Mais sans soutien mes mains sont liées. 

Cette fois cela ne dépend pas de moi. C’est vous qui décidez si celle-ci est ma dernière annonce publique, ou si je viens juste de commencer.
Après avoir publié ce vidéo, je retournerai l’ordinateur emprunté et je resterai encore sans internet.
Vous m’aiderez en partageant cet appel.

Vous m’aiderez en contribuant un centime.
Car chaque centime reçu de son peuple vaut plus que les millions des puissances étrangères.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

 One day our daughter said she wanted to write a book called ""Teacher Samantha's Spider School"".  We asked her what the story was about and her reply was ""Spider School is where bad spiders learn to be good spiders!"".   We thought that was such a great idea that we helped her sketch it out over a few weeks and we put together this page so that she can earn the money to actually publish her story!  We really appreciate any support for our budding young author. Vivi has either written, drawn, or approved every page of this book.
 This book can help remind young children that some spiders are dangerous.  We appreciate any contribution you feel comfortable making and please enjoy the perks as we want this whole project to be fun for our little girl!    What We Need & What You Get This is what the funds will be used for:  Fonts, background images, and illustrations needed.  Publishing of the actual 7 x 7 full color glossy book and shipping.
 Marketing costs to promote Spider School.







    The Impact Teacher Samantha's Spider School - Malcolm Learns Manners is a great way to teach kids of all ages that some spiders are friendly and not to be feared, but that other spiders can be dangerous.  It is also a great way to teach manners since this first story focuses on the new spider student Malcolm.  Child friendly introduction to spiders and manners. Vivi plans to read Spider School at the local library whenever possible. Great way to support this 3 year old author on her first book!
    Risks & Challenges  We will be self publishing the book through a small service.  Since it is a small run the books are a little expensive, so we apologize for the extra cost, but we will make sure that each copy is high quality.  We've made sure that we can make small runs of the book to reduce cost.

It's book 1 of The Archangel Series. I'm planning a six book series. It's been available for purchase on Amazon.com for a few months now. I've sold a little over 30 copies. I allowed the book to be free to download on Kindle over Memorial Day weekend and I sold over 180 free copies. </p>
<p>The goal of this fundraiser is to reach a broader and bigger audience. With the copies I've sold thus far; they have gone to people within my connections. I'd like to be able to reach those I've never met, but who are very interested in the genre I love to write. </p>
<p>Advertisements and promoting aren't cheap. Since I self-published, I have to do all the ads and promoting myself. I am a young man with a part-time job, I'd love to make novel writing my career. I know I can do it; but I know I need help. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Where will the Money Go?</h3> <p>I know $3,500 is a lot of money, but it's the goal I've calculated after adding all the expenses.</p> <ul> <li>$370 - Press Release. By purchasing this press release, my book will be featured on news outlets like New York Times, USA Today, etc.. It will also be easier to find on major search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. It will be posted on over 250,000 PRWeb news subscribers as well as to over 30,000 journalists and bloggers. </li> <li>$300 - Advertisements on Amazon.com. I will divide these up into two categories. $200 for Amazon Kindle Ads which appear on the side of the screen and appear as suggestions. And $100 for Keyword Searches on Amazon which appear when you search for others like it. </li> <li>$200 - Social Media Ads. Facebook mainly. Boosting the book's fan page and its posts. </li>
<li>$700 - Book Orders. I can't get my own copies for free, but I do get them at a discounted price. $700 for 100 copies of my paperback. I'm planning on doing a book signing at Half Price Books in Orland Park, Illinois. </li>
<li>$1,100 - Merchandise. Custom merchandise. $850 for 6 custom Archangel rings. $200 for 10 custom Archangel war banners. $50 for 250 custom Immortal bookmarks. </li>
<li>$640 - Extra Copies. I have a great chance to do a book tour in and around Chicago, Illinois and possibly Columbus, Ohio. With the remaining amount, I will order more paperback copies. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What You Get!</h3> <p>Fundraising and promoting is no simple task. But with your help, we can achieve this together. Your donations will not go unnoticed. Each donor will receive a free PDF download of Immortal. I know it's not as exciting as a free copy, but as I've mentioned before; I can't get free copies. </p>
<p>There will also be some specialty prizes for large donations, but will be kind of like how deferred pay works. If my goal isn't reached, the grand prize may not be granted, but you will get someone else really awesome. </p> <ul> <li>Each donation, no matter how large or small, will grant you a free PDF download of Immortal. </li> <li>The larger prizes that I mentioned are granted in exchange for larger donations. With a donation of $100 or more will grant you one of the limited Archangel Rings. But you'll have to hurry, they are limited.</li> <li>If the goal isn't reached to achieve the Archangel Ring, you will instead be granted either one of the following: A free signed paperback copy of Immortal, an Archangel War Banner, or a meet and greet with myself. </li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Please make sure you select one of the perks so that I can email the PDF download to you. </span><br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why You Should Donate?</h3> <p> I ran another fundraiser in order to have my book edited and published and even though that goal wasn't reached, I managed to find alternate ways to get both accomplished.</p>
<p>Immortal is a new and fresh story, one that hasn't been borrowed or re-imagined. I only have a few reviews on Amazon.com, but last I looked; I had three 5 star reviews and one 4 star review. I understand that's not a lot of reviews to back me up, but there are also no bad reviews either. </p>
<p>I have a lot of faith in my writing. I know deep down that I can do this. I can be a full-time author. I want to show the world my imagination through words on pages. Allow them to enter the world I've created and live it alongside me. </p>
<p>I believe in my writing and I believe in myself. When you read this book, you will not only fall in love with the characters, but you'll fall in love with the story. My hope is after you read this book and put it back on the shelf; your anticipation for the sequel will be as grand as your anticipation for Star Wars Episode 7 before it was released.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What if I don't Reach the Goal?</h3>
<div>If my goal is not reached, I will work to manage the advertisements and promoting another way. I did it before and I can do it again! </div>
<h3>Can't Donate? Help Me Share!</h3> <p>If you are not able to contribute, there are other ways you can help!</p> <ul> <li>Share this page on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, and YouTube.  </li> <li>Tell your friends, your family, your co-workers, tell that random guy you always bump into at the store.

is a book of personal stories of people 
who had settled in the jungle of Guatemala in the 1960's and '70's,
forming the <i>Cooperativa Ixcan Grande</i>.
They subsequently survived the years of violence that engulfed the area during
Guatemala's civil war. The purpose of the book is to give voice to people who

""ordinary"" citizens.</p>
<p>     From 1972 to 1975 I (The author, Mike Sullivan) flew for an agrarian land reform project
in Guatemala. The program, called Projecto Ixcan Grande, gave people enough
land to support a family, freeing them from a life of migrant labor on large
plantations. There were no roads in the area, hence the use of small planes. A
guerilla movement arose in the late 1970's and the area of the Ixcan was caught
up in a state of warfare and repression.</p>
<p>    Then the Guatemalan
army came in, set up forts and began kidnapping local community leaders,
teachers, catechists, etc. Denouncements to the press were not allowed in
print. Complaints to the government and army were stonewalled. In desperation
the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City was occupied, hoping that this act would
cause the international press to take notice. Some organizers, including interviewee ""Chepe Salas"" came from Ixcan. The government response was to burn down the embassy with the protesters
and some Spanish diplomats inside.</p>

<h3>Project/ author Background:</h3>
<p>     I have been
involved with the people of the Ixcan since 1972. I was there for two and a
half years as a pilot during the initial settlement of the Cooperatives. In the
late 1980's I produced a video about the people and the violence. In January
of 1993 I accompanied the first organized return of refugees from Mexico to
Guatemala. All of 1996, and the next three summers, were spent in the Ixcan,
once again flying for the cooperative. The interviews presented in this book stem from three trips to Ixcan in 2010 and 2011. Photographer Tony O'Brien and myself published a book on children in Afghanistan titled <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Afghan-Dreams-Young-Voices-Afghanistan/dp/1599902877"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Afghan Dreams</a> (link to book on Amazon).</i> </p>

Ixcan is a chance for the people to give voice. To tell their stories in their
own words. Your donation helps make this happen.
The amount we are requesting is to cover the expenses of
publication, publicity, associated fees, and distribution of the book. Any
amount received over the stated goal will be seed money for a Spanish language
version.  In the event that the entire
goal is not reached, the amount we do receive will still go toward publication
of the book. In addition any donor of $50.00 USD or more will receive a signed
copy of Recuerdos de Ixcan.

The Impact:


  Recuerdos de
Ixcan is a chance for the people to give voice. To tell their stories in their
own words. Your donation helps make this happen.

Project/ author Background:
     I have been
involved with the people of the Ixcan since 1972. I was there for two and a
half years as a pilot during the initial settlement of the Cooperatives. In the
late 1980's I produced a video about the people and the violence. In January
of 1993 I accompanied the first organized return of refugees from Mexico to
Guatemala. All of 1996, and the next three summers, were spent in the Ixcan,
once again flying for the cooperative. The interviews presented in this book stem from three trips to Ixcan in 2010 and 2011. Photographer Tony O'Brien and myself published a book on children in Afghanistan titled Afghan Dreams (link to book on Amazon).

<p>There's no doubt about it, we <b><i>love</i></b> music. Some people create it, others work with it, virtually everyone listens to it. It forms the very soundtrack to our lives.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But what makes a <b><i>great</i></b> piece of music? A catchy melody? Definitely. Killer lyrics? Possibly. But if you really want to uncover the X-Factor that helped Mark Ronson shift 14 million copies of <i>Uptown Funk</i>, it's essential to understand how we <b><i>experience</i></b> music.</p>

Music fans
Whether you listen at home, at the gym, or in your car, The X-Factor in Music Uncovered reveals the incredible ways your favourite music keeps you listening again and again.

Music creators
If you’re a composer, songwriter, artist or producer, The X-Factor in Music Uncovered will help you write more engaging music more likely to succeed in a competitive marketplace.
Music professionals
If you work with music (such as in radio, streaming, film, TV, music supervision, video games, sports, marketing or branding), The X-Factor in Music Uncovered reveals how to create musical experiences with maximum impact.
It's also the perfect companion for anyone who studies or works with music therapy, education or research since it provides an accessible introduction to the neurological, physiological and behavioural effects of music.





What's so special about it?

From radio to playlists to movies and marketing, music is everywhere. And every year, hundreds of scientific studies on music are published. Yet these studies remain largely inaccessible to the population at large. In The X-Factor in Music Uncovered, I take this research and apply it to music you're sure to be familiar with, opening it up to a larger audience. This makes The X-Factor in Music Uncovered a one-of-a-kind resource.

<br/><p>My name is L. Ruben Willis.  Here online, I am best known by the pseudonym of Tortured Cyclone. I am looking to find a way to break free from the financial constraints that have prevented me for most of my life from pursuing my love of writing.</p>
<p>I am in my mid-40's, with a wife who is permanently disabled and two children. Due to this, it has been necessary to work two jobs to keep my family fed, clothed, and to provide shelter and transportation for them. This has meant sacrificing my aspirations as a writer to take care of those needs.</p>
<p>Two years ago, my wife had a stroke. That combined with the wear and tear on my body from assorted aches and pains has brought it fully to my attention that I'm getting older. My dream of writing, if I do not pursue it, is on the verge of being lost forever.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I started writing more in 2013. And then I discovered Twitter. In the past year and a half, I have become one of the most prolific poets on the site, with more than 4,600 followers and still growing. There is more than enough material written there, to pull into several collections of poetry. In order to make that happen, a significant time investment of at least a couple hours a day needs to take place. A time commitment heretofore impossible while working sixty hours a week in two jobs. <br/></p>
<p>To that end, I am looking at raising $10,000 to eliminate the need of a second job for at least 2015, providing the income that is currently gained from my secondary part-time job, and allowing me to make my writing a committed part-time job. I am also seeking to use funds from that goal in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase an up-to-date laptop computer with at least a terabyte in storage capacity, and processing ability to handle multiple tasks.</li>
<li>Purchase necessary software for the enhancement of productivity and the ability to create poetry that is paired with stock, royalty-free images. This includes the Microsoft Office 365 software package. Dragon voice-recognition software, with headset, Photoshop image software and Film editing software to create promotional videos as needed.</li>
<li>Create an online presence, through the registration of domain names, purchasing webspace for storage and web hosting and creation of a website to promote and preview my writing.</li>
</ul>If I am not able to reach my goal, funds will be divided evenly between my family needs and technological upgrades, with web-presence being the final piece to be addressed.<br/><br/>As a thank you for participating, all donors will get a shout-out in the acknowledgements of my haiku eBook, which needs tweaking before being submitted as an eBook through the Amazon/Kindle store, and my Worlds of L. Ruben Willis anthology, due to be published in eBook form by the end of the year.<br/><br/>Other perks will include the shout out and inclusion as a Cyclone Chaser on Twitter and/or Facebook, the ability to have a personal chat with me via Voxer or Skype, and printed-on-demand, signed copies of the haiku collection and anthology.<br/><br/>In the past year, writing during free time, I have been able to draft and post more than 4,000 micropoems and several longer pieces, both essays, long-form poetry and prose. Having the ability to have dedicated writing time every day, combined with being able to reduce the workload upon myself should allow me to keep pushing forward with projects in the upcoming year.<br/><br/>Already, my blog, In the Eye of the Storm, has been nominated for the Liebster Award, which recognizes deserving small-follower count blogs. Two of my poems are included in the upcoming ""Neverlasting"" poetry compilation, due out in February of this year, from Fiery Verse LLC, and writing of mine has been featured on VoElla.com and wolfpublishing.com.<br/><br/>The financial issues have been a huge stumbling block over the years, stopping me from getting anywhere as a writer, due to the need to make sure the bills are paid and that everything gets taken care of. That's why this is so important. In order to break the financial chains that are preventing me from taking the next step, as a writer, I need your help!<br/><br/>Even if you can't contribute, get the word out! Read my writing on Twitter and Facebook, and comment! Take a look at the publications and websites that have featured my writing. Share here on IndieGogo.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>TC</div><br/></div>","My name is L. Ruben Willis.  Here online, I am best known by the pseudonym of Tortured Cyclone.

That's why this is so important. In order to break the financial chains that are preventing me from taking the next step, as a writer, I need your help!Even if you can't contribute, get the word out!

Using fiction as a way to portray positive messages in the lives of those who need it is of vital importance in our time.

He's just your average foster kid who's lived his life within the often times disfunctional system. He just wants a normal life, he just wants to worry about normal things kids worry about like getting to the summer's hottest party. But on his 17th birthday, Nick's life decides to take him on an unexpected adventure. Follow along as Nick's world is turned upside down, as he battles and ancient evil and comes to terms with just who he is in the world. 

MM BEEMANMM Beeman is not your average youth fiction writer. He's on a mission to bring some adventure into the reading world for those who mostly, hate reading. His stories involve characters who battle to find the  path of right in a world and a life where everything seems wrong. 

MM has worked with those who are called 'disenfranchised' or 'at-risk' youth for over 10 years. What he likes about them is their potential, their veracity, their gumption. What he strives to achieve is to write stories that provide the reader moral and spiritual insights that are often found lacking in the society of today, while presenting them in a unique and entertaining manner. 

MM's unique experiences in childhood gave him a heart for kids who are often misunderstood in society. Individuals who have been given less and who often have to deal with more.

The primary goal if this series is to to open up doors of evangelism and mentoring, while understanding that creating captivating characters is the lynch pin to accomplishing this. 

    The Impact The impact that art has on our society and especially our youth is one that lasts. Hours and hours of entertainment, video games, movies, comic books - they take up residence in our lives.

<p>The Tishman Review believes in paying the poets, writers and
artists for the pieces we publish in our quarterly literary journal and that’s
where you come in.</p>
<p>Maura and Jennifer started The Tishman Review to BE
DIFFERENT! They’ve been using their own money and the generous donation from
Jennifer’s Mom to get them started. All of the staff at TTR volunteer all of
their hours because they are passionate about our mission to publish stellar
poetry, fiction, art and creative nonfiction.</p><p>Tishman
Review is produced in three different formats: PDF, e-book
and print-on-demand. TTR believes that by giving authors space
for their words, the existential function of literature is honored and the
journal’s readers’ lives are enhanced.<br/></p>
<p>How is TTR different from all the other literary magazines:</p>
<p>1)  We
pay our contributors semi-professional rates.</p>
<p>2)  We
read blind. This means we cannot see the writer’s biography with previous
publishing credits until after we have decided to accept or decline. We judge
the piece solely on its words. It’s all about the words.</p>
<p>3)  We
produce the magazine in three different formats: viewable online for free,
e-book and print-on-demand. This ensures that everyone can read the magazine.
And, if someone wants something to hold in their hands, they can order a print
copy. </p>
<p>4)  About
half of all submissions received at TTR get a personal response from our
editors. Plus, if a submitter chooses an expedited response they are guaranteed
to get editorial feedback. We know how much work goes into each piece submitted
to us and we do our best to offer not only encouragement but constructive
feedback.</p>
<p>5)  We
strive to interact with everyone who crosses TTR’s path with respect, honoring
their contribution, whether with our generous benefactors, our volunteer staff,
or the artists and writers that submit to us.</p>
<p>6)  We
ask for revisions! When a piece has promise, we will ask the writer if they are
interested in working with us on revising the piece. Sometimes, this works out
and when it does, the piece is happily accepted. This gives writers a fair
chance in the extremely competitive world of literary journals.</p>
<p>7)  We
charge a submission fee to cover our Submittable costs, website fees, and other
costs of hosting an online version and producing a layout suitable for a print
issue. BUT, we also host free submissions days monthly, so that all writers can
submit no matter their economic status.</p><p>Our first tickler issue, launched on January 15, 2015, has been an amazing success. Over 1,200 people have opened the online version of the magazine to read it. Our April issue will be our first full-length, from the submission pile, issue and will be full of stellar fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, art and photography.</p>
<p>Who

<p>Artists who work
hard all day as servers in restaurants to pay their way through college, taking
their photographs on their time off. Writers who stay home with their children,
write during naps and live on one income. Poets who shuffle together enough
money to pay the rent by teaching a class here or a class there and then work
nights tending bar, all so they can commit themselves to their craft. Essayists
who teach elementary school by day and write by night, sending their MFA
student loan payments in on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>This is the
literary world as it’s become in our challenging economy. Sometimes our own
contributors return their payments to TTR as a way of supporting the many new
and emerging contributors who struggle to make ends meet.</p>

<p>We have website hosting fees, banking fees, a yearly fee to

office expenses. Most calls for submissions are paid advertisements, but we
must put these calls out to writers to solicit submissions. There are some
costs in producing the magazine in three different formats; though we work
tirelessly to keep these as low as possible. 
But primarily, contributor payments run us around $1,000.00 an issue.</p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We will

<p>It sounds bad. And so sad. And like it would kill a bull. But it's ok. I'm ok. My mom is ok. Our relationship (remarkably!) is ok. It's sad. But it's ok. And it's mine.</p>
<p>I was born into shame. I feel certain it was the first feeling my mother felt when she found out she was pregnant with me and the first feeling she felt when I came out brown instead of white; indicating her worst fears were true. The man standing next to her in the delivery room, 18 years her senior was not the father of this baby. Shame. I hold shame around the weeks and months following my late husband’s accident. I was called stoic and strong, but it felt like, “you aren’t sad enough.” I had a business to run and bills to pay…so many bills. It didn't matter that at times I thought the grief would overtake me, and that felt ok. Shame. Shame around the fact that I do not know who my biological father is. That to be honest, no one does right now. We have options. And I am going to get answers. Shame. Shame around the fact that I have always wanted to be a writer, traveling the world and sharing my experiences. Who am I to deserve the life I’ve dreamt about since I was a little girl? 80,000 Indian children go missing every year, I've held them in my arms... but I want to travel and write. Shame.  </p>
<p>Full disclosure that overall I had a very “normal” and happy childhood, but this shame comes up when I’m doing serious self-reflecting. I have a super high-energy, happy demeanor and I am so blessed to be showered with love from my friends and family; however, that does not take away from my shame and the very tragic events of my life that I feel are worth a deeper discovery. </p>
<p>People have told me for years to ask if there was ever anything they could do. So, I’m asking. The resources I have most readily available to me are my writing skills (thanks OU), some people who believe in those skills, my story, and me, which is enough to provide start-up money. </p>
<p>The first time I thought about writing my story was when I applied to The E.W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University. I’ve always loved to write. I feel a calling to write a memoir/novel/screenplay and I need the time to write the manuscript. I may fail. Maybe no publishers will be interested and I'll self-publish. My writing may suck; my story unoriginal. Or I might find that I don’t want the self-actualization and account of this book and bail three quarters of the way through. Let me apologize in advance for that, but I don't foresee that happening.  It will be a work in progress; changing and evolving. If you don’t care about that and would like to contribute to the pipe dream I have then I greatly, greatly appreciate your support and manifest that gratitude in the form of memoir!</p>
<p>In facing my shame and the honest account of the first quarter century of my life, I hope to shine light on it and turn that shame into owning who I am and the life of my dreams. I’m willing to ask people to help me achieve it because I want to achieve it that badly. </p>
<p>I read Jen Sincero’s You Are A Badass last October and she said something that really resonated with me. (I’m going to botch the story, so go buy the book yourself. It's worth it!) She asked, “how badly do you really want what you say you want?” If you want to travel the world badly enough you’ll go to the airport with a sign that says, “accepting one way ticket anywhere” and you’ll wait. This is my sign. I'm finding my light. I know writing will help. I know that light creates more light and writing is the best way for me to share mine.</p>
<p>I'm asking for $2,500 because that will allow me the time to focus on my writing and ideally have a manuscript ready in 3-6 months. For every gift of $50 you will receive a free copy of the book (either in digital or print format depending on publisher interest). Gifts of all sizes are incredibly appreciated. Thank you for believing in my story and the benefit it may have for myself and others. If I don't reach the goal, I'll use what fund I do have to still try and write enough to send to an editor and still eat every day. Haha!</p>
<p>This project is near and dear to my heart. It feels like the potential I have been asked to fulfill. I hope the value added is for every person young and old, regardless of gender to see someone risk a lot (sharing their shameful story, asking for money to help achieve a dream...scary stuff) and say out loud that, if no one else, I at least know that I am deserving. And in seeing someone else do it they too will know they are deserving of working hard and asking for help when they need it in order to achieve fulfillment during their time on Earth. A happy world is a world full of happy people.</p>
<p>My biggest hurdles in this endeavor are going to be sharing the deepest and darkest parts of myself, my story, and my past. Stories that could bring up pain and uncomfortable emotions for my entire family…that's why they live in Ohio and I'm doing this in Oregon. Haha! No, I know this is the time to share this story and the motivation of being accountable to other people who are invested in my writing will be my greatest gift in overcoming any hurdles.</p>
<p>If you aren't interested in giving, please share my story with anyone who's message it may benefit. To be of service is my life's greatest goal and I know this is how I can do it to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>The book is a compilation of 49 poems written the last 3 years. Why 49? A thought is never complete, silences is infinite. Completion is relative and our thoughts are relative.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Hello!</h3><p>Did you know there are more than 3 billion people using messaging applications —1 billion on Facebook alone?</p><p>My name is Kerry Gardiner and Bookbot Bob and Bookbot Bill are the product of my passion for self-publishing. I have been publishing crime fiction since 2014 after graduating from university with a degree in law. Once I realised how useless that actually was for a 'middle-aged' single mother, I turned my hand to writing - and I've never been happier. </p><p>The Bots appeared one night knocking on my sub-conscious demanding to be brought to life. Much like the characters in my books as it happens. Self-publishing is hard, and getting harder all the time. There are opportunities out there to promote your work but they are often expensive, and ineffective. People are growing more resistant to giving out their email addresses (who can blame them) and it is a constant battle to stand out from the noise of a crowded inbox. </p><p>The aim of my campaign is twofold. Firstly, to raise money for advertising to gain more subscribers - thus increasing the return on investment for the authors using the service - and to develop an app. Facebook is the first major platform to allow the use of chatbots. However, Whatsapp and iMessage will be following suit very soon and it is my intention to create an app that will allow subscribers to choose what platform they would like to use. This will be the very first of it's kind.</p><p>Chatbots really are the future of book marketing and it is important to be ahead of the curve. Current open rates for messages on the Bookbots are upwards of 80% and CTR's are upwards of 50%. Industry standard for email CTR's are in the region of 2%. </p><p>I'll just let that sink in for a moment. </p><p>In order to take the Bots to the next level, I am seeking $10,000 in funding.

I have been publishing crime fiction since 2014 after graduating from university with a degree in law. Once I realised how useless that actually was for a 'middle-aged' single mother, I turned my hand to writing - and I've never been happier. The Bots appeared one night knocking on my sub-conscious demanding to be brought to life. Much like the characters in my books as it happens. Self-publishing is hard, and getting harder all the time. There are opportunities out there to promote your work but they are often expensive, and ineffective. People are growing more resistant to giving out their email addresses (who can blame them) and it is a constant battle to stand out from the noise of a crowded inbox. The aim of my campaign is twofold. Firstly, to raise money for advertising to gain more subscribers - thus increasing the return on investment for the authors using the service - and to develop an app. Facebook is the first major platform to allow the use of chatbots. However, Whatsapp and iMessage will be following suit very soon and it is my intention to create an app that will allow subscribers to choose what platform they would like to use. This will be the very first of it's kind.Chatbots really are the future of book marketing and it is important to be ahead of the curve. Current open rates for messages on the Bookbots are upwards of 80% and CTR's are upwards of 50%. Industry standard for email CTR's are in the region of 2%. I'll just let that sink in for a moment. In order to take the Bots to the next level, I am seeking $10,000 in funding. This will be to allow me to advertise, develop the app and maybe get a nice coffee machine! (Joking, I have a well trained 12-year-old for that.)In return for your investment you will get in on the ground-floor of something pretty special.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, there were hundreds of Norwegian newspapers in America. On newsstands in local stores and delivered straight to people's mailboxes, these provided a touchstone for immigrants and their descendants. </p>
<p>Things are different now. Thanks to the internet, Norwegian immigrants in America can keep right on reading their hometown newspapers, and the descendants of those older immigrants are Americans now. Most don't even speak Norwegian! </p>
<p>So is there still a need for this 128-year-old newspaper, the <i>only</i> (mostly English-language) Norwegian newspaper left from all those hundreds?</p>
<p>We think there is. </p>
<p>The Norwegian American (formerly the Norwegian American Weekly) has been described as <strong>""surprisingly interesting""</strong> by readers young and old. It turns out that Norway is a pretty cool country, and we have lots to say about it!</p>
<p>The Norwegian American is moving with the times. In the last three years we've greatly enhanced our digital edition and expanded our presence on Facebook and Twitter (and a little bit Instagram).</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe we're still not <i>quite </i>as with the times as we could be.</p>
<p>At The Norwegian American <strong>our focus is on content. </strong>Norway is so much more than bunads and lefse (though we still love bunads and lefse!), and we love looking at both the history <i>and</i> the vibrant, modern country the Old Country has become. From Hardanger fiddle to Black Metal; from rømmegrøt to New Nordic cuisine; from Asbjørnsen &amp; Moe's folk tales to Jo Nesbø's latest crime thriller, we bring Norway right to your mailbox. Or to your social media. </p>
<p>Our paper version is still our best product. The Norwegian American publishes biweekly, 25 issues a year, with news from Norway and the Norwegian-American community, business, sports, opinions, research &amp; science, recipes, events, travel, reviews, comics, crossword puzzles, fiction, language articles, and of course heritage features. Almost all of these features are also available in our digital version.</p>
<p>The newspaper is supported through subscriptions and advertising, but this doesn't <i>quite</i> cover our operating costs. Please consider helping us close the gap by choosing one of the perks below, donating, or by being a subscriber or an advertiser.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Two years ago, the people in charge of this paper looked at the finances and decided to pull the plug. They're gone now, and we remain, so you can see how well that worked! </p>
<p>But, okay, the finances are still not great.</p>
<p>Since that time we've cut costs hugely by switching from weekly to biweekly production and moving to a cheaper office just outside Seattle. I'm very pleased to say that our bottom line has gone from $-35K in 2014 to $-21K in 2016. I'm even more pleased to say that this is true <i>despite</i> increasing our wages and benefits paid by $64K! But that still means that we are operating at a loss each year.</p>
<p>Last time we did an Indiegogo campaign we raised over $40K, and that's lasted us this long. If we can raise that much again, I hope to make it last even longer this time... maybe until we achieve self-sufficiency? </p>
<p>We are moving in the direction of self-sufficiency, but there's also an endless list of things I could spend our increased revenue on. Here is a partial list of the things we'd like to spend money on: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Marketing.</strong> The year before we almost stopped publishing, advertising wasn't even a line item. How can you increase subscribership without marketing? Unfortunately the cliché that it takes money to make money is accurate.</li>
<li>
<strong>Payroll.</strong> Yes, it's gone up a lot. It still needs to go up more, because not only are the paper's two full-time and two part-time employees grossly underpaid, but we could also really stand to bring on another person or two. I bet we'd sell more advertising if the Advertising Manager position here was a full-time gig! And there are aspects of this business that suffer because we two editors just don't have the time—like social media, the afore-mentioned marketing, and good old-fashioned reporting.</li>
<li>
<strong>Content.</strong> We currently get most of our ""surprisingly interesting"" content for free. Which is amazing! But I have been saying I want to pay all contributors ever since I took over as editor, and I'm ashamed that it still hasn't happened.</li>
<li>
<strong>Travel to Nordic festivals.</strong> One of the most effective ways we've found to increase our subscriber base is to physically go where the Norwegian Americans are and shove our papers in their faces. But the financial rewards of doing so are only realized over time—with slim profit margins on our product, it takes a LOT of new subscriptions to pay for a trip to Minot, ND (for example). These trips do double duty because they're also a great source of connections and story ideas and lions and tigers and bears, oh... maybe not those last few.</li>
<li>
<strong>App development.</strong> You can already access our online content from any device you choose, but these days anyone who's anyone has an app. And we don't. But we'd like to!</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Holy lutefisk, do we have some great perks on offer!</p>
<p><strong>""Heroes of Ragnarök"":</strong> First of all, we promise to recognize all of our donors, from $1 up, on our website's <a href=""http://www.norwegianamerican.com/heroes-of-ragnarok/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heroes of Ragnarök page</a>. In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is the apocalypse. There are natural disasters, and wars, and many of the gods and goddesses die. But after it's all over, the world is refreshed, ready to grow back better than ever. We survived an apocalypse two years ago, and we're stronger than before. But we still need heroes like you in order to keep doing our work.</p>

<p><strong>Nils Anders Magnet-backed notepad (in multiple packages; $7):</strong> See the little guy above? He's sort of our mascot, a hidden person who's looking for his lost family. He really hates it when he can't find a piece of paper to write shopping lists and love notes on, so he's here to help! We don't have an image of the actual item yet, because we won't be ordering them until the campaign closes, but we're going to make it look something like the image on the right. It sort of looks like Nils Anders is in jail! I wonder what he's done?</p>

<p><strong>Nils Anders shot glass (in multiple packages; $8):</strong> If drinking is more your thing than shopping lists and love letters—or if you simply find that one helps make the others more fun—we've got the glasses for you! These tall shot glasses will go perfectly with your aquavit (or other booze or even espresso). The image above is an approximation, because these haven't been ordered yet either.</p>

<p><strong>Waffle bandana (in multiple packages; $25):</strong> These incredible bandanas are <i>only</i> available through this campaign. Designed exclusively for The Norwegian American by Kristin Derby and produced by Hovden Formal Farm Wear, these look good enough to eat! Available in the four colors shown: classic black, Norwegian blue and red, and a vaguely waffle-toned cream. </p>

<p><strong><i>A Taste of Norway: Flavors from The Norwegian American</i> cookbook (in multiple packages; $29):</strong> By popular demand, we're bringing you a collection of recipes that have been featured on the pages of The Norwegian American. With over 50 recipes from such acclaimed Nordic food writers as Daytona Strong, Sunny Gandara, Maria Stordahl Nelson, and this paper's own former editor, Christy Olsen Field, the spiral-bound cookbook will cover main courses, soups and sides, and of course sweets. It even has a few drink recipes!  </p>

<p><strong>Old Ballard aquavit club ($250):</strong> Our friends at Old Ballard Liquor Co. have offered this <i>amazing </i>perk to Seattle locals: one bottle of aquavit each quarter plus two at Christmas (six total)! You get Älskar (a citron aquavit designed to pair with oysters), Midsommar (a rich, woodsy, and flavorful dill aquavit), Skogen (aquavit flavored with freshly harvested Sitka Spruce tips), Riktig (a classic Norwegian-style aquavit), Tomten (a juletide aquavit made specifically for Glögg), and Ragnarok (a 120-proof dark aquavit for hardcore vikings). For more info on Old Ballard, visit <a href=""http://www.oldballardliquorco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their website</a>. **Please note that this perk does not ship.

<p><strong>Aquavit pairing dinner for six ($1000):</strong> Join the Old Ballard Liquor Co. for an exclusive six-course aquavit pairing dinner for six featuring contemporary Northwest Nordic cuisine and a variety of domestic and imported aquavits to try. These private dinners are available exclusively through contributions to organizations like The Norwegian American and are not offered for purchase any other way. It promises to be a once-in-a-lifetime dinner! Locally sourced, seasonal dishes will showcase the amazing bounty of the Pacific Northwest as seen through the eyes of Scandinavian cooking traditions. For more info on Old Ballard, visit <a href=""http://www.oldballardliquorco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their website</a>. **Dinner will be scheduled with OBLC and will take place in Seattle**</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One-year digital subscription ($30): </strong>You get one year's access to all the content on <a href=""http://www.norwegianamerican.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.norwegianamerican.com</a> (don't worry; it's mostly in English!). This includes all the articles published in the print edition of the newspaper and occasional web-only features. It does not include things like Nyheter fra Norge, letters to the editor, crossword puzzles, folk tales from Tuss og Troll, items on the Bulletin Board, or anything else that doesn't easily lend itself to blogification. </p>
<p>But that's why we still love our... </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One-year print subscription (in multiple packages; $70*): </strong>The newspaper is a 24-page tabloid, with larger special issues approximately once a month. One page is fully Norwegian, with news from Norway, and bilingual content is often featured. The standard sections are news, business, sports, opinion, food, travel, research &amp; science, arts &amp; entertainment, norsk språk, and features with a slant toward Norwegian heritage and local Norwegian-American happenings throughout the U.S. Special issues focus on topics of interest to the community, from education and travel to clean energy and alcohol, with, of course, celebration of major holidays like Easter, Syttende Mai, and Christmas.</p>
<p><i>Print subscriptions also include digital access, if you provide an email address.</i></p>
<p>*$70 for U.S. addresses, $94 for Canada, and $212 for Norway and all other countries. The difference will be added in shipping when you select these perks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491760053/b6zvvh02tyyh3jehvwnf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Community Connections ad (in ""Newsprint Connections""; $50 value):</strong> You don't have to be a nisse to use our Community Connections ads—they're perfect to mark a birthday, anniversary, graduation, or other milestone. These black and white ads are approximately 5x3.5” and can include a photo and a few lines of message. You’ll work with The Norwegian American to design the greeting at least one month prior to placement (within the next year, please).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Business card ads (black and white $39 value each; color $57 value each):</strong> You send us a digital version of your business card and we print it in the paper—what could be easier? Please note that this offer is for landscape business cards only and that they will print slightly smaller than actual size.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Norwegian postcard fiction ($26):</strong> Editor Emily C. Skaftun does this really weird thing: she writes approximately 100-word fiction (usually science fiction or fantasy) stories inspired by postcards on the postcards themselves. Then, if you select this perk, she mails it to you! She has 15 postcards from Norway in her stash, and one might have your name on it...</p>
<p>But if you get a weird postcard in the mail in a couple months, remember this moment, because it very likely <i>won't</i> have your name on it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492022664/smgr9xqcedu3gbxlvlug.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Set of 20 vintage postcards ($27): </strong>When we first found these vintage Norwegian postcards hiding away in our old office, we didn’t know where they came from—or really anything about them—but we knew we had exactly seven sets, and we decided to share them with you through our campaign. Well as it turns out, there’s a lot more where that came from!</p>
<p>Postcard enthusiast Esther Van Noy had these lovely postcards made from enhanced versions of antiques she collected over the course of decades. Most of these were originally sent over a century ago from people in Norway to their relatives who had immigrated to America. The lithographs and hand-tinted photographs depict the life and culture of Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, and Lofoten.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Scandinavian Hour ads ($125): </strong>Be a part of the Seattle-area institution known as the Scandinavian Hour. This package is for three 105-word ads to be aired on the show, worth $50 each. You write them or work with Doug Warne, the show's host.</p>
<p>Want to be more involved? See the next perk!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DJ for a day ($150):</strong> Who's a Radio Star? You are! Co-host the Seattle-area KKNW Scandinavian Hour with Doug Warne. Write and present an ad for your company or club fundraiser, introduce a few records, and chat a bit on air! The show records on weekdays and airs on Saturday mornings.

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks &amp; challenges? That's all we've got!</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we're still a newspaper in 2017. We strongly believe there's a way forward for niche publications like ours, but the numbers for newspapers are sobering. If we can't survive until we make the leap to digital—and many of our loyal readers are not ready for us to make that leap—then we still might not make it.</p>
<p>I don't want to minimize the risk, but I think it's important to look at how far we've come toward sustainability—we were losing $35K in 2014 and last year it was only $21K, and that's <i>after</i> increasing payroll expenses by $64K! Not only that, but the two big cost-cutting measures we took last year (going biweekly and moving to a cheaper office space) took place in May and July—so we have still not seen a full year of financials reflecting the new reality. We are so close!</p>

Once upon a time, there were hundreds of Norwegian newspapers in America. On newsstands in local stores and delivered straight to people's mailboxes, these provided a touchstone for immigrants and their descendants. 
Things are different now. Thanks to the internet, Norwegian immigrants in America can keep right on reading their hometown newspapers, and the descendants of those older immigrants are Americans now. Most don't even speak Norwegian! 
So is there still a need for this 128-year-old newspaper, the only (mostly English-language) Norwegian newspaper left from all those hundreds?
We think there is. 
The Norwegian American (formerly the Norwegian American Weekly) has been described as ""surprisingly interesting"" by readers young and old. It turns out that Norway is a pretty cool country, and we have lots to say about it!
The Norwegian American is moving with the times. In the last three years we've greatly enhanced our digital edition and expanded our presence on Facebook and Twitter (and a little bit Instagram).
Okay, so maybe we're still not quite as with the times as we could be.
At The Norwegian American our focus is on content. Norway is so much more than bunads and lefse (though we still love bunads and lefse!), and we love looking at both the history and the vibrant, modern country the Old Country has become. From Hardanger fiddle to Black Metal; from rømmegrøt to New Nordic cuisine; from Asbjørnsen & Moe's folk tales to Jo Nesbø's latest crime thriller, we bring Norway right to your mailbox. Or to your social media. 
Our paper version is still our best product. The Norwegian American publishes biweekly, 25 issues a year, with news from Norway and the Norwegian-American community, business, sports, opinions, research & science, recipes, events, travel, reviews, comics, crossword puzzles, fiction, language articles, and of course heritage features. Almost all of these features are also available in our digital version.
The newspaper is supported through subscriptions and advertising, but this doesn't quite cover our operating costs. Please consider helping us close the gap by choosing one of the perks below, donating, or by being a subscriber or an advertiser.
 

What We Need
Two years ago, the people in charge of this paper looked at the finances and decided to pull the plug. They're gone now, and we remain, so you can see how well that worked! 
But, okay, the finances are still not great.
Since that time we've cut costs hugely by switching from weekly to biweekly production and moving to a cheaper office just outside Seattle. I'm very pleased to say that our bottom line has gone from $-35K in 2014 to $-21K in 2016. I'm even more pleased to say that this is true despite increasing our wages and benefits paid by $64K! But that still means that we are operating at a loss each year.
Last time we did an Indiegogo campaign we raised over $40K, and that's lasted us this long. If we can raise that much again, I hope to make it last even longer this time... maybe until we achieve self-sufficiency? 
We are moving in the direction of self-sufficiency, but there's also an endless list of things I could spend our increased revenue on. Here is a partial list of the things we'd like to spend money on: 


Marketing. The year before we almost stopped publishing, advertising wasn't even a line item. How can you increase subscribership without marketing? Unfortunately the cliché that it takes money to make money is accurate.

Payroll. Yes, it's gone up a lot. It still needs to go up more, because not only are the paper's two full-time and two part-time employees grossly underpaid, but we could also really stand to bring on another person or two. I bet we'd sell more advertising if the Advertising Manager position here was a full-time gig! And there are aspects of this business that suffer because we two editors just don't have the time—like social media, the afore-mentioned marketing, and good old-fashioned reporting.

Content. We currently get most of our ""surprisingly interesting"" content for free. Which is amazing! But I have been saying I want to pay all contributors ever since I took over as editor, and I'm ashamed that it still hasn't happened.

Travel to Nordic festivals. One of the most effective ways we've found to increase our subscriber base is to physically go where the Norwegian Americans are and shove our papers in their faces. But the financial rewards of doing so are only realized over time—with slim profit margins on our product, it takes a LOT of new subscriptions to pay for a trip to Minot, ND (for example). These trips do double duty because they're also a great source of connections and story ideas and lions and tigers and bears, oh... maybe not those last few.

App development. You can already access our online content from any device you choose, but these days anyone who's anyone has an app. And we don't. But we'd like to!

 
What You Get
Holy lutefisk, do we have some great perks on offer!
""Heroes of Ragnarök"": First of all, we promise to recognize all of our donors, from $1 up, on our website's Heroes of Ragnarök page. In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is the apocalypse. There are natural disasters, and wars, and many of the gods and goddesses die. But after it's all over, the world is refreshed, ready to grow back better than ever. We survived an apocalypse two years ago, and we're stronger than before. But we still need heroes like you in order to keep doing our work.

Nils Anders Magnet-backed notepad (in multiple packages; $7): See the little guy above? He's sort of our mascot, a hidden person who's looking for his lost family. He really hates it when he can't find a piece of paper to write shopping lists and love notes on, so he's here to help! We don't have an image of the actual item yet, because we won't be ordering them until the campaign closes, but we're going to make it look something like the image on the right. It sort of looks like Nils Anders is in jail! I wonder what he's done?
Want to learn more about Nils Anders? Start here.

Nils Anders shot glass (in multiple packages; $8): If drinking is more your thing than shopping lists and love letters—or if you simply find that one helps make the others more fun—we've got the glasses for you! These tall shot glasses will go perfectly with your aquavit (or other booze or even espresso). The image above is an approximation, because these haven't been ordered yet either.
 

Waffle bandana (in multiple packages; $25): These incredible bandanas are only available through this campaign. Designed exclusively for The Norwegian American by Kristin Derby and produced by Hovden Formal Farm Wear, these look good enough to eat! Available in the four colors shown: classic black, Norwegian blue and red, and a vaguely waffle-toned cream. 

A Taste of Norway: Flavors from The Norwegian American cookbook (in multiple packages; $29): By popular demand, we're bringing you a collection of recipes that have been featured on the pages of The Norwegian American. With over 50 recipes from such acclaimed Nordic food writers as Daytona Strong, Sunny Gandara, Maria Stordahl Nelson, and this paper's own former editor, Christy Olsen Field, the spiral-bound cookbook will cover main courses, soups and sides, and of course sweets. It even has a few drink recipes!  

Old Ballard aquavit club ($250): Our friends at Old Ballard Liquor Co. have offered this amazing perk to Seattle locals: one bottle of aquavit each quarter plus two at Christmas (six total)! You get Älskar (a citron aquavit designed to pair with oysters), Midsommar (a rich, woodsy, and flavorful dill aquavit), Skogen (aquavit flavored with freshly harvested Sitka Spruce tips), Riktig (a classic Norwegian-style aquavit), Tomten (a juletide aquavit made specifically for Glögg), and Ragnarok (a 120-proof dark aquavit for hardcore vikings). For more info on Old Ballard, visit their website. **Please note that this perk does not ship. LOCAL PICKUP ONLY!**
 

Aquavit pairing dinner for six ($1000): Join the Old Ballard Liquor Co. for an exclusive six-course aquavit pairing dinner for six featuring contemporary Northwest Nordic cuisine and a variety of domestic and imported aquavits to try. These private dinners are available exclusively through contributions to organizations like The Norwegian American and are not offered for purchase any other way. It promises to be a once-in-a-lifetime dinner! Locally sourced, seasonal dishes will showcase the amazing bounty of the Pacific Northwest as seen through the eyes of Scandinavian cooking traditions. For more info on Old Ballard, visit their website. **Dinner will be scheduled with OBLC and will take place in Seattle**
 
One-year digital subscription ($30): You get one year's access to all the content on www.norwegianamerican.com (don't worry; it's mostly in English!). This includes all the articles published in the print edition of the newspaper and occasional web-only features. It does not include things like Nyheter fra Norge, letters to the editor, crossword puzzles, folk tales from Tuss og Troll, items on the Bulletin Board, or anything else that doesn't easily lend itself to blogification. 
But that's why we still love our... 
 
One-year print subscription (in multiple packages; $70*): The newspaper is a 24-page tabloid, with larger special issues approximately once a month. One page is fully Norwegian, with news from Norway, and bilingual content is often featured. The standard sections are news, business, sports, opinion, food, travel, research & science, arts & entertainment, norsk språk, and features with a slant toward Norwegian heritage and local Norwegian-American happenings throughout the U.S. Special issues focus on topics of interest to the community, from education and travel to clean energy and alcohol, with, of course, celebration of major holidays like Easter, Syttende Mai, and Christmas.
Print subscriptions also include digital access, if you provide an email address.
*$70 for U.S. addresses, $94 for Canada, and $212 for Norway and all other countries. The difference will be added in shipping when you select these perks.
 

Community Connections ad (in ""Newsprint Connections""; $50 value): You don't have to be a nisse to use our Community Connections ads—they're perfect to mark a birthday, anniversary, graduation, or other milestone. These black and white ads are approximately 5x3.5” and can include a photo and a few lines of message. You’ll work with The Norwegian American to design the greeting at least one month prior to placement (within the next year, please).
 
Business card ads (black and white $39 value each; color $57 value each): You send us a digital version of your business card and we print it in the paper—what could be easier? Please note that this offer is for landscape business cards only and that they will print slightly smaller than actual size.
 

Norwegian postcard fiction ($26): Editor Emily C. Skaftun does this really weird thing: she writes approximately 100-word fiction (usually science fiction or fantasy) stories inspired by postcards on the postcards themselves. Then, if you select this perk, she mails it to you! She has 15 postcards from Norway in her stash, and one might have your name on it...
But if you get a weird postcard in the mail in a couple months, remember this moment, because it very likely won't have your name on it.
 

Set of 20 vintage postcards ($27): When we first found these vintage Norwegian postcards hiding away in our old office, we didn’t know where they came from—or really anything about them—but we knew we had exactly seven sets, and we decided to share them with you through our campaign. Well as it turns out, there’s a lot more where that came from!
Postcard enthusiast Esther Van Noy had these lovely postcards made from enhanced versions of antiques she collected over the course of decades. Most of these were originally sent over a century ago from people in Norway to their relatives who had immigrated to America. The lithographs and hand-tinted photographs depict the life and culture of Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, and Lofoten.
 
Scandinavian Hour ads ($125): Be a part of the Seattle-area institution known as the Scandinavian Hour. This package is for three 105-word ads to be aired on the show, worth $50 each. You write them or work with Doug Warne, the show's host.
Want to be more involved? See the next perk!
 
DJ for a day ($150): Who's a Radio Star? You are! Co-host the Seattle-area KKNW Scandinavian Hour with Doug Warne. Write and present an ad for your company or club fundraiser, introduce a few records, and chat a bit on air! The show records on weekdays and airs on Saturday mornings. To learn more, visit the Scandinavian Hour's website.
 

Two Nights in Skoppum ($250): Contributor David Burke has generously donated a two-night stay in his bed & breakfast, complete with organic breakfasts. Apparently there are goats! To learn more about the B&B, visit The Goats' Garden's website and (for great photos of the property, hot tub, and goats) Airbnb listing.
 

The Impact

Now imagine how far we can go!
 

Risks & Challenges
Risks & challenges? That's all we've got!
At the end of the day, we're still a newspaper in 2017. We strongly believe there's a way forward for niche publications like ours, but the numbers for newspapers are sobering. If we can't survive until we make the leap to digital—and many of our loyal readers are not ready for us to make that leap—then we still might not make it.
I don't want to minimize the risk, but I think it's important to look at how far we've come toward sustainability—we were losing $35K in 2014 and last year it was only $21K, and that's after increasing payroll expenses by $64K! Not only that, but the two big cost-cutting measures we took last year (going biweekly and moving to a cheaper office space) took place in May and July—so we have still not seen a full year of financials reflecting the new reality. We are so close!

<h3>Production, Publishing, Printing, and Perks</h3>
<p>Our total goal will fund the production and circulation of this year's issues.

<p>With every issue, we strive to give you an experience that's worth your investment. We're excited to start this year off with our Spring/Summer 2018 issue, which will fuse art and activism.

<p>And as always, our visionary art director and designer, <a href=""http://brittanyloar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brittany Loar</a>, is ready to create another beautiful edition that you'll not only want to keep forever, but never put down.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.publitas.com/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Publitas</a> will be publishing and hosting this year's digital editions. We love the presentation and functionality the online publisher provides our digital subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Printing: </strong></p>
<p>We're always exploring sustainable printing options so that we can produce a high-quality, eco-friendly magazine that's affordable for us as well as our readers. When we order a larger quantity, the price per issue decreases and printing becomes more affordable. Succeeding with this campaign will allow us to print at a quantity that makes more financial sense, while giving you the option to buy an annual subscription.</p>
<p>In the past, we've worked with California-based <a href=""https://www.greenerprinter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greenerprinter</a>. We are now considering other sustainable printers, including <a href=""http://www.rollingpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rolling Press</a>, a family-owned print house based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p><strong>Perks: </strong></p>
<p>In addition to having your choice of subscriptions for our 2018 issues, we have a few extra perks to offer. <a href=""https://axiologybeauty.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Axiology</a> is a vegan, natural, and palm-oil free lipstick brand that we've had the pleasure of featuring in recent issues. We have a limited quantity of their <a href=""https://axiologybeauty.com/collections/lipstick/products/bad-brown-lipstick-natural-and-organic-lipstick"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bad</a> lipstick shade (a deep brown that looks beautiful on everyone) available to include with our annual print and digital subscription.</p>
<p>And if you want styles straight from the pages of Ethical Style Journal, we also have a few really beautiful, high-fashion pieces, featured in our Fall/Winter 2017 issue, available as premium perks.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a magazine focused on ethical and sustainable fashion, we're doing our part to shape fashion culture into one that is as much about awareness as style. As a supporter of <a href=""http://ethicalstylejournal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ethical Style Journal</a>, you are part of this. By subscribing to our magazine, you provide us with the means to continue to expand upon and change the fashion industry for the better, and in turn, create a more compassionate, inclusive, equal, and just world.</p>
<p>Below are our values, so you can see how they align with your own.</p>
<p>We Value:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ethics</strong>—fair and equal pay for garment workers, and safe working conditions for them as well. We value people over profit.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sustainability</strong>—industry processes that are less wasteful and hazardous to people, the planet, and animals. We value environmental consciousness as a principle in the creation of fashion.</li>
<li>
<strong>Transparency</strong>—to know who, what, and how our dollars impact. We value the informed decisions we're allowed to make when we know.</li>
<li>
<strong>Animal life</strong>—innovation and creativity has allowed us to welcome cruelty free fashion. We value new fashion free of animal products or byproducts, and free of conflict in the way of deforestation, habitat loss, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dialogue and action</strong>—to improve humankind, particularly dialogue and action that has influence on creating healthier job and living opportunities, and promotes equality for people of color, globally.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe in progress over perfection, and we're thrilled to present you with fashion and stories that will guide us to better times.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge that we have faced and continue to face is budgeting time and money. It takes tremendous resources to bring a fashion magazine to life, from building relationships with brands, sourcing clothing, scouting locations, and scheduling shoots, to funding layout and printing. With a very small team doing the work of entire staffs of people, and only a fraction of the resources, we each feel the pressure to produce great content in a timely and budget-friendly manner.</p>
<p>Additionally, growing our readership in an age of free content and in an increasingly digital world, will always be a challenge. We plan to address all of this by continuing to build a personal relationship with our audience, and by creating and growing in a way that will provide an experience that's unique and worth investing in. We'll keep going until we have nothing left to give.</p>
<p>We believe this spirit is what will sustain our fashion magazine.</p>

Entertainment Television, Disney, ABC, Paramount Pictures.</p><p>While working full time and raising a gorgeous daughter, I attended Pacifica Graduate Institute to study mythology and depth psychology with such luminaries as Marion Woodman and James Hillman.

<li>All teaching and coaching materials to create your own circle or to incorporate into your coaching practice.</li>
<li>Templated marketing materials to use to promote your individual or group coaching.</li>
<li>I will provide one basic social media/newsletter style banner that you can customize with your own name and dates.</li>
<li>I will give you my template for copywriting your sales page and email announcement.</li>
<li>I will not provide “hands on” services to implement the creation of marketing materials. I can give you a list of my recommended service providers.</li>
<li>For the first 6 months (February 2019 - August 2019) you can contact me via email with coaching questions</li>
</ul><p>The first 9 weeks will be a fertile training ground as you go through each of the three cycles and work with your own materials. After this training period you are encouraged to begin using Unbound in your coaching and courses.</p><p>I suggest that you jump in right away because I will be available to you for support without my extra 1-1 fees. After August 2019 you are still welcome to coach with me for $75/hour.</p><p><strong>The Unbound Cycle “voices” comes from three goddesses:</strong></p><ol>
<li>Lila = play, creativity</li>
<li>Lilith = sex, life force</li>
<li>Aphrodite and Venus = pleasure; the glue that joins the three worlds in <i>Unbound</i>.</li>

Entertainment Television, Disney, ABC, Paramount Pictures.While working full time and raising a gorgeous daughter, I attended Pacifica Graduate Institute to study mythology and depth psychology with such luminaries as Marion Woodman and James Hillman. With Ph.D. in hand, I began my quest to create a business that would uplift other entrepreneurs and trail blazers.Through my book UNBOUND, you will walk away knowing how to weave your own sensual spell and reawaken enchantment in your life and business.This may all sound like fluffy fantasy or fairytale, but I’ve done this for myself by following specific “pleasure power” practices the past six years.UNBOUND is first and foremost grounded in the authority of your own sensate experience. It takes into account your spiritual self-sovereignty.There is only one version of the YOU living in this body, in this lifetime.After reading UNBOUND you will clearly identify your natural passions, accept your desires and follow your dreams so that you live a life that is prosperous, generous, love-based and pleasure-soaked.“How can I be like you? How can I have a life like [insert your favorite celebrity/athlete/author/etc here]?”The answer is simple. BE in your body.Pleasure is the most powerful form of presence in the world. Treat yourself as a sacred being and you will create and live from your heart and your creative source, which is namely your pleasure zone.Being in your pleasure zone while you are doing anything brings out your natural genius and gifts. “Will this book help me figure out what my brand/personal myth really is about?”YES!My mission is to help you find your unique voice and story, and then embody it through the most delicious and adventurous life you can dream up! You aren’t just alive to bring home a paycheck.You are meant for so much more … to be so much more. “Can I take what I learn and then teach the material in Unbound to my own community?”Affirmative.My intention in creating the worldwide Unbound Circle is to give you the tools to bring to life the teachings and concepts of the book Unbound so you can provide them for the benefit of your own community. What you pay for when you contribute to an Unbound Circle perk:
9-week training and certification course with me; 
pdf workbooks and all digital files;
printed binder for coach/leader;
2 printed, spiral bound workbooks for your coaching clients and students (additional workbooks may be purchased separately in February 2019);
licensing to use the materials in your own coaching practice or course curriculum FOREVER.
All other folks who purchase the licensing for the Unbound Circle will have to pay quarterly to continue to use the program and the assets.Whether you’re inspiring a small circle of good friends and entrepreneurs or leading a large online group, the Unbound Circle will provide an impactful, transformative 9-week curriculum you can easily plug into your own teaching and/or coaching programs. My first book Return to Enchantment: Your Guide to Creating a Magical Livelihood was published in 2015 to rave reviews and hit the top 20 list of best sellers on Amazon in the Women, Small Business category!Thank you for supporting me in my last Indiegogo campaign for Return to Enchantment. I get so many emails thanking me for this book because it truly is a balm for the feminine soul!Women want to be sovereign, savvy and wildly prosperous in their businesses, yet often the world tells them that they need to be like MEN to achieve their dreams.Men and women are different and have different needs and ways of moving through the world. Plus, so many men tell me that wish to find the FACE OF THE FEMININE in their own industries too! It's not just the women who are wounded by our hyper-masculinized cultural values ... the men are too.UNBOUND: An Aphrodisiac to Unleash Magical Passion in Your Life and Work​ is poised to go even wider and deeper than my first book. I appreciate your time, your encouragement and LOVE reviewing my campaign.Deep, deep bows of gratitude,Kris
What I Need & What You GetI'm raising $10,000 to cover the costs of the book editing, formatting (print, eBook formats) audio/spoken word version, cover design as well as the creation of the materials for the Unbound Circle  (video classes, audio meditations and classes, pdf and printed workbooks) that will accompany the release of the book. The Unbound Circle will have it's own home on the internet and include worksheets, video instruction and a private Facebook group to help participants connect to one another in their parts of the world.I'm working on the second draft of UNBOUND right now and plan to write a third draft to be completed by mid-November.Everyone that contributes to my campaign will get a sample chapter, or two, at the end of October 2018 so they can get a taste of the deliciousness to come. Exciting, YES?!! MORE ABOUT UNBOUND, THE BOOK.This book will help you:
Take ownership of your story. You are the author of your reality.

The first 9 weeks will be a fertile training ground as you go through each of the three cycles and work with your own materials. After this training period you are encouraged to begin using Unbound in your coaching and courses.I suggest that you jump in right away because I will be available to you for support without my extra 1-1 fees. After August 2019 you are still welcome to coach with me for $75/hour.The Unbound Cycle “voices” comes from three goddesses:
Lila = play, creativity
Lilith = sex, life force
Aphrodite and Venus = pleasure; the glue that joins the three worlds in Unbound.
I did not choose these goddesses. Rather they stepped forward for me as three unique presences who wish to guide and teach humanity.I believe they came to me because all three goddesses represent powerful, dynamic forces of soul activation and agency.Unbound is about redefining your life purpose using the power of your imagination, working in three life areas:work = play = Lilalife force energy = sex = Lilithpleasure = power = AphroditePleasure is the power that transforms us. We all have powerful magic within us to create a life of meaning, deep Abiding Love, pleasure and prosperity.Each cycle is explored through mythology, astrology, tarot symbology, archetypal psychology, and esoteric magical practices.A cycle includes 7 lessons and the estimated time needed to complete each is 3 weeks.At the completion of a cycle, you will take a short assessment that is comprised of short essay questions and a creative project.Once the assessment and creative project are complete the next cycle will be unlocked.After the completion of all three cycles you will be awarded a certificate of completion and will have full access to the marketing and teaching tools you’ll need to integrate Unbound into your coaching or online teaching business.The objective of Unbound Circle is to have an intimate and safe place to explore these three spheres of influence with like-minded individuals who also want to go DEEP.Deep into the meaning of their your influence in the world.During the 9-week study where you reflect on your own alchemical make up and are ready to bring out your magical essence into the world, you can bring my work into your community and share the materials (curriculum, worksheets and video content).Be a leader and teach others the Unbound approach to creating a life that feels soaked through and through with pleasure, power and magic.Part 1: The LILA Cycle

<p><strong>Help get Total Theatre Magazine back up and running in time for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, August 2017! </strong></p>
<p>For over 30 years, Total Theatre Magazine has been at the forefront of the advocacy and documentation of contemporary theatre and performance practice – and we now need your help if we are to survive. </p>
<p>In the past, Total Theatre Magazine has been funded by Arts Council England and University of Winchester. Last year (2016) the strings were cut. We staggered on (unpaid) for six months. The website went down early 2017. </p>
<p>Between March and May 2017, there has been progress. Aurelius Productions has rescued the website, and it has been reinstated at <a href=""http://www.totaltheatre.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.totaltheatre.org.uk</a>.</p>
<p>But we need content for our online magazine. We need the funds to re-instate the work of the editors and key writers. We need, specifically, to get the Reviews and Features sections working: to pay the Editor, Web Editor, and Reviews Editor a modest fee; and to create a go-and-see fund to pay expenses for the team to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe 2017, and to other key festivals and events this year.</p>
<p>Total Theatre Magazine is unique as an artist-led practice-based publication and resource that celebrates, supports and documents innovative work by artists and companies creating ‘total theatre’ – a term we resist defining too tightly, but which includes: physical, visual and ensemble devised theatre; dance-theatre; mime and clown; contemporary circus; cabaret and new variety; puppetry and animation; street arts, outdoor performance, and site-specific theatre; live art performance and hybrid arts.</p>
<p>This work is rarely covered in the mainstream press, and often not even in specialist arts publications. Total Theatre Magazine has a 30-year reputation as THE publication that covers physical and visual performance work.</p>
<p>Would you like to help us continue that good work? That would be very much appreciated. Every little helps…  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We've set the target at £5,000, which we are hoping to achieve in a six-week campaign.</p>

<li>Create a Go-and-See fund which will provide us with the means to get to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2017, and other key festivals and events in summer/autumn 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>Your kind and much valued contribution, of any size, will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the Reviews and Features section of the website working again</li>
<li>Buy us time to put together a consortium of supporters, to keep Total Theatre Magazine afloat from late 2017 through 2018</li>
<li>Give us the space to make funding applications to create an interactive online archive of the magnificent 30+ year set of print editions of the magazine, and other related material</li>

<p><u>The Problem</u> </p>
<p>The U.S. has 5% of the world's population, but 25% of its prisoners, 96% of who will return to society.</p>
<p>The annual cost of prisons to the tax payers has been recently estimated at over $80 Billion, which keeps rising. The recidivism rate--the rate at which those released to society return to prison--within 5 years of release, is at over 49%. In other words, $80 Billion spent to fail nearly one-half of the time, without accountability.</p>
<p>This, despite education lowering recidivism rates by nearly 43% and it being shown for every dollar spent on education, four dollars are saved on incarceration.</p>
<p><u>Investing Toward a Solution</u> </p>
<p>For the past 17 years I've developed classes for, taught and mentored federal prisoners. A passion realized after coming in as one of them.</p>
<p>Seeing something in me, a friend and mentor showed me how to recognize, take responsibility for and let go of negative ideas, attitudes and beliefs and replace them with ones that have since replaced a life in turmoil with one of profound joy and inner freedom. The path taken to inner freedom was laid out by education acquired from books of substance. I have since strongly wished this freedom for others. Realizing crime's social and financial cost to society, prisons doing little to nothing to help alleviate either, I was inspired to do something to make a difference..</p>
<p>Mark Twain wrote, There are only two important days in a man's life: the day he's born and the day he learns why.</p>
<p>My ""<i>why""</i> began with the creation of a life-skills development and reentry preparation course, which introduces a seminar I call ""The Tree of Life."" It has had a profound positive affect on the prisoners, resulting in nearly 100% of its graduates who've released back to society building successful, contributing lives.</p>
<p>Seeing such success with The Tree of Life message in the lives of people who'd otherwise be considered broken beyond repair, my ""<i>why""</i>  expanded, extending it to friends, family and strangers, many of whom bound only in prisons comprised of ego-centric walls. Most of them have since realized freedom from self-imposed limitations, awakened to personal ""whys,"" and now live their passions.</p>
<p>Extending further, I turned the seminar into an educational book of substance, <i>The Tree of Life, Sowing Your Seeds of Destiny</i>,  accompanying it with a companion booklet, <i>The Tree of Life Goal Cards</i>,  excited for its message helping more people from all walks of life. But to ensure this happens, I need help raising the initial costs associated with publication and getting the word out to the world about the book's presence, message and purpose.</p>
<p>These cost total about $1,089.50</p>
<p>4 Filed ISBNs @ $129.00 ea =                         $517.00<br/>(2 for The Tree of Life and 2 for its Goal Card companion, each needing paperback and e-Book formats.)</p>
<p>1 Copyright Fee:                                           $85.00<br/>(For companion book only, a supporter having already covered the fee for the main book.)</p>
<p>1 Registered Trademark Fee:                        $87.50<br/>(For the companion booklet.)</p>
<p>Marketing/Promotional Fees:                        $400.00<br/>(This will cover the initial costs associated with: author-purchased copies, mailing, advertising and webpage upgrade.)</p>

Seeing something in me, a friend and mentor showed me how to recognize, take responsibility for and let go of negative ideas, attitudes and beliefs and replace them with ones that have since replaced a life in turmoil with one of profound joy and inner freedom. The path taken to inner freedom was laid out by education acquired from books of substance. I have since strongly wished this freedom for others. Realizing crime's social and financial cost to society, prisons doing little to nothing to help alleviate either, I was inspired to do something to make a difference..
Mark Twain wrote, There are only two important days in a man's life: the day he's born and the day he learns why.
My ""why"" began with the creation of a life-skills development and reentry preparation course, which introduces a seminar I call ""The Tree of Life."" It has had a profound positive affect on the prisoners, resulting in nearly 100% of its graduates who've released back to society building successful, contributing lives.
Seeing such success with The Tree of Life message in the lives of people who'd otherwise be considered broken beyond repair, my ""why""  expanded, extending it to friends, family and strangers, many of whom bound only in prisons comprised of ego-centric walls. Most of them have since realized freedom from self-imposed limitations, awakened to personal ""whys,"" and now live their passions.
Extending further, I turned the seminar into an educational book of substance, The Tree of Life, Sowing Your Seeds of Destiny,  accompanying it with a companion booklet, The Tree of Life Goal Cards,  excited for its message helping more people from all walks of life. But to ensure this happens, I need help raising the initial costs associated with publication and getting the word out to the world about the book's presence, message and purpose.
These cost total about $1,089.50
4 Filed ISBNs @ $129.00 ea =                         $517.00(2 for The Tree of Life and 2 for its Goal Card companion, each needing paperback and e-Book formats.)
1 Copyright Fee:                                           $85.00(For companion book only, a supporter having already covered the fee for the main book.)
1 Registered Trademark Fee:                        $87.50(For the companion booklet.)
Marketing/Promotional Fees:                        $400.00(This will cover the initial costs associated with: author-purchased copies, mailing, advertising and webpage upgrade.)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>There's Nothing Wrong With You</strong> is a children’s picture book geared towards children of the progressive parent.</h2> <p>It’s 2016 now, and gender identity and sexual orientation aren’t taboo subjects anymore.

<h3>About The Book</h3>
<p><i>My wife believes this book was written for her. My mother thinks I’ve put my story on paper because I simply have to keep myself busy, and it was a helpful distraction, when I was in jail. My best friend is sure I must be crazy to be sharing that kind of information. He thinks that even jail can’t tame my hunger for fame, and I want to be remembered in the world that grows more and more delusive as days go by. My editor thinks I’m hoping for a pardon…</i></p>
<p><i>These people know me well enough, understand me, and sometimes even read my thoughts. And they’re all right in their different ways. But there is something else. The main thing is, this book is written for you and you only, my dear reader. I’m not that naïve and don’t believe that a dangerous cyber criminal like me with three serious felony convictions on my record, guilty all around, will simply get a pardon. And I’m not a hypocrite to write here that I deserve it.</i></p>
<p><i>I will spend 10 years in prison. My beautiful wife will most likely leave me. My much beloved grandfather, who brought me up, will die before I get out. My mother will age due to her grief rather than time. My friends will start seeing me as a ghost, someone they have nothing to discuss with. You don’t share joy from your child’s birthday or your summer trip with a ghost, it’s too awkward. I will also change, I will morph into a psycho with yellow skin and bad teeth. I will be a moral monster, stressed out, angry and violent. I can’t change what’s happened to my life. But your destiny can be different…</i></p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Books have the power to change lives, one tome at a time. I know because a single book--Mya Angelou's ""I Know Why The Caged Birds Sings""--changed mines. With everything book I write, aspiring writer I assist, workshop I give and book cover I design, my goal is to inspire someone towards betterment, reflective in both my professional, readership  and workshop reviews.</p>
<p><u><strong>Professional reviews:</strong></u></p>
<p>""Fresh writing and an honest recognizable heroine."" <i>–Publishers Weekly </i></p>
<p>""Johnson-Hodge offers a poignant and lyrical tale of dreams lost, dreams deferred and dreams reborn."" <i>–Booklist</i></p>
<p>""A book so memorable it will become a classic in years to come."" <i>–Midwest Book Review </i></p> <p><u><strong>What my readers had to say:</strong></u></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“This book was recommended to me by my boyfriend. I was skeptical at first, but it had me from the very first page. This book really deals with issues that women of today face as far as their personal relationships with their men and people in general. I cried, I laughed, and I cried again. I truly love this book.”</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“A Journey to Here reminded me why I love Margaret Johnson Hodge and rekindled my desire to absorb more of her work. A beautiful, honest look at the consequences of betrayal (perceived or otherwise), and the rebuilding of shattered lives. Loved it!”</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“I appreciate how Johnson-Hodges takes this controversial subject and presents it without extreme craziness. Instead, she allows the reader in delve into the inner person and explores why they do the things they do. As always Margaret Johnson Hodges has given readers a well written, interesting and captivating novel that is highly recommended.”</p>

</div></div>","About Me
I started writing at the age of 13 and haven't stop.

 
I Design Book Covers

 
I give writing workshops.

And I mentor aspiring writers...
 
Why Indiegogo?
Seed funding allows me to expand my business, providing the assets and the opportunity to reach more people and impact more lives.
 
My Upcoming Releases
 
 
 
Summary
With decades of being dedicated to my craft, helping others along the way, I'm ready to do more, be more and help more, empowering people to following their writing dreams and celebrate my own.
 

What I Need & What You Get
 
Staffing:     $3000

With the myriad of events I'm planning, support staff is a must.  
 
Book Launch Event:   $5000.00

With the release of my 16th and 17th body of work, I'm celebrating in a big way! Not only will there be a book sign event at a gorgeous venue, but a performance of my one-woman show-- ""A New York State of Mind: An Evening With Margaret Johnson-Hodge,""  complete with delicious food and specialty cocktails!
 
Pre-Publicity:  $500.00

While you can't ‘buy’ a good review, you can secure honest ones from these three major giants.
 
Publishing Copies:  $1300.00

This amount is based on a print run for my book release party.
 
Perk
Funding of $275 or more

With a donation of $275 or more, you'll be a special invited guest, receive honorable mention at my book launch event and signed copies of both books, plus shipping. Event is being planned for October, 2017.
 

The Impact
Books have the power to change lives, one tome at a time. I know because a single book--Mya Angelou's ""I Know Why The Caged Birds Sings""--changed mines. With everything book I write, aspiring writer I assist, workshop I give and book cover I design, my goal is to inspire someone towards betterment, reflective in both my professional, readership  and workshop reviews.
Professional reviews:
""Fresh writing and an honest recognizable heroine."" –Publishers Weekly 
""Johnson-Hodge offers a poignant and lyrical tale of dreams lost, dreams deferred and dreams reborn."" –Booklist
""A book so memorable it will become a classic in years to come."" –Midwest Book Review  What my readers had to say:
“This book was recommended to me by my boyfriend. I was skeptical at first, but it had me from the very first page. This book really deals with issues that women of today face as far as their personal relationships with their men and people in general. I cried, I laughed, and I cried again. I truly love this book.”
“A Journey to Here reminded me why I love Margaret Johnson Hodge and rekindled my desire to absorb more of her work. A beautiful, honest look at the consequences of betrayal (perceived or otherwise), and the rebuilding of shattered lives. Loved it!”
“I appreciate how Johnson-Hodges takes this controversial subject and presents it without extreme craziness. Instead, she allows the reader in delve into the inner person and explores why they do the things they do. As always Margaret Johnson Hodges has given readers a well written, interesting and captivating novel that is highly recommended.”
 
What my writing workshop participants had to say:
     “I found it unique and thought-inspiring.”   - Liz M.
      “...opened the door on how to start writing.”  - Pedro R. 
      ""...gave me a lot of ideas to combat writer’s block.”  - Mary W. 
      “I discovered I still had stories inside of me!”    - Alana M.

<h3>Who I Am &amp; What I Do</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525284851/cclcb1voegy7e0oi7lpk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I'm Joanna Hastings. I'm a writer, educator, and theatre professional.  I've spent the last 30 years as an actor, playwright, storyteller. teacher, principal, and mother. I’ve thought a lot about what inspires kids, how to get them to engage deeply with their own creative selves. Now I’m able to focus full time as an author in a highly original, experiential genre. I’ve brought my knowledge of kids with me, and I’ve created a unique reading experience for them that makes them feel personally invited into a special, magical world. You can see how it works <a href=""http://flyingtrunkstories.com/how-it-works"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve created and tested eleven Story Experiences, complete with fascinating artifacts, often vintage or hand-crafted, which bring a unique sense of authenticity to the Stories. More are on the way: I have three Stories in development right now.  Now I'm ready to take Flying Trunk Stories to the next level and engage a wider audience. In order to to do this, I have to find powerful, accessible ways to let people know that this company, and this unusual product, exist. I invite you to share my journey!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My Indiegogo goal is $15,000. In order to successfully expand Flying Trunk Stories, I have to radically increase awareness of my product through website promotion at a local and national level. </p>
<p>The most important expense is social media marketing: coordinated, complementary, continuous campaigns on Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram.  </p>
<p>To support that, I need to invest in photography and video, my second most important expense. These assets will support website enhancements, social media campaigns, and media packets for publications and TV. </p>
<p>I need printed materials, most importantly brochures for live events and media packets. </p>
<p>So your money will go towards these different aspects of marketing, fulfilling perks, and IndieGoGo fees (without which none of this could happen. </p>
<p>The most fun part will be sharing aspects of the Stories with you as perks! There are many ways and levels to get a taste of the Flying Trunk world. We start with small, magical artifacts with an intriguing message from a character, and go all the way up to a completely new, unique Story Experience written and crafted specifically for a child you love.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've put my heart into FTS, and also my resources. Now, the biggest obstacle that I face is lack of funding to spread the word. The main risk is simply that I won’t be able to raise enough money to ignite marketing and gain enough ground to support credibility with the public. That's why I'm here, and that's why I'm turning to you. Every step I can make towards a greater reach makes my business stronger, and makes my Stories more accessible to families and kids who will be excited by them.  </p>
<p>I have produced 11 stories this year with more on the way, and the recipients can verify the quality and prompt delivery. Scalability will be a good challenge: I work alone right now, and am fortunate to have the skills and experience to be able to handle that. I will need more person-power to stay on top of orders once demand increases; the high level of personalization makes for a time-consuming product. I'm confident that, with your help, greater reach will allow the business to be sustainable and offer the ability to employ assistants in the future.</p>

<p>“My 10 year old just presented her dad with a handwritten, original poem, rolled up into a scroll and tied with a pretty ribbon. This is a girl with a bright mind and severe fine motor skill deficits. I've never seen her write something without prompting before. Well done, Flying Trunk Stories! Now excuse me, I think I am going to go cry.” —Carolyn N. (parent)</p>
<p>“She loved it! She couldn’t wait to show it to everyone. Her mother and her both participated and had a ball. She opened up the last package with me and she was so excited. She absolutely loved it. I have to say it was quite the experience for her. I am so thankful.” —Greg S. (grandparent)</p>

There are not a lot of opportunities for kids to experience that kind of magic. I really appreciate that you include older kids, too.

<p>“We were so impressed by the story that our four-year-old daughter received from Flying Trunk Stories. Kids don’t often get mail of their own; our Anna loved receiving not just mail, but packages, every week. Every day, she would run to the mailbox to see if Roberta Rabbit had sent another package. The experience of receiving letters with artifacts was magical for Anna; she was so engaged listening to every detail of Bobbie’s journey, while she turned her newest artifact over and over in her hands. We adults were enchanted.” —Kristin H-P.

<p>This is the second edition of my book Balintawak Eskrima - my first-hand account as the oldest living survivor of Grandmaster Anciong Bacon. I am a passionate and avid promoter of this indigenous Filipino Martial Art, Eskrima/Kali/Arnis.  A significant portion of my life has been dedicated toward its advancement - starting as a student over half a century ago, then as a teacher, a historian and chronicler of group events.

<p>This book is a brief compendium of Philippine historical facts. It is also a definitive record of a history of the art, its masters and legends - its foundation, techniques, principles, philosophies and a glossary of common eskrima lexicon.  Likewise included are our shared hopes for young masters and the future of the art.  This book will contain a plethora of illustrative and historical pictures.  It will be an expansion of the current edition, to appear most possibly in two volumes.</p>

<h3>Precog Magazine</h3>
<p>is an independent, annual magazine dealing with technology, materiality, and visual culture, emphasizing the contributions of women and non-binary artists and artists of color, published and produced by artists Florencia Escudero, Gaby Collins-Fernandez, and Kellie Konapelsky. We aim to support artists by publishing their ideas and images on their own terms, and to use our physical print platform to create opportunities for community and conversation. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funds for Printing and Commissions!</h3>
<p>100% of the funds we make from selling the magazine and merchandise featuring artworks and themes from the magazine go back into printing. Our goal of $7000 would allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print Issue 4: Empire Vampire </li>
<li>Reprint Issue 3: Transformation</li>
<li>Support the creation and printing of Issue 5, including compensation for contributors, and the production of a digital version of the magazine as a virtual game</li>
<li>Expand our reach and audience by having more physical copies available for distributors and academic libraries</li>
</ul>
<h3>Precog Perks</h3>
<p>Perks for this campaign include pre-ordering Issue 4, purchasing back issues of the magazine, and our hand-produced, limited edition merchandise. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Precog Magazine is unique in that it is made by artists, in support of artists. We are committed to using print publication both as a medium for our contributors to experiment, and as a platform to communicate their ideas to a wider audience. Funding for this project would allow the magazine itself to become more experimental, and greater financial security would help us to advocate for our contributors!</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle in the creation of Precog is the cost of publishing a magazine independently. With limited resources, we are also constrained to smaller print runs, which (beside being more expensive per issue than a larger run) limits the booksellers, academic libraries, and outside groups we can approach to carry the magazine. </p>
<p>Previous fundraising efforts and your excitement about Precog is one of the reasons we can still make the magazine each year! This has allowed us to participate in the New York Art Book Fair, as well as other book fairs nationally and internationally, which is why we are confident that this fundraising drive will have such a big impact on our reach. We are so appreciative of the community which already exists around Precog, and hope to find ways to make that community grow in terms of the artists we include, our supporters, and our audience. </p>
<p>Please share widely, regardless of your ability to contribute. We depend on word of mouth, and are excited and appreciative of all the forms of community that arise! </p>

<h3><strong>NO EASY MONEY</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><i>""You never win playing by the rules.”</i></strong></h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs face challenges every day from inside the business and from the world around them. It’s hard to be a hero. This is the story of an entrepreneur who wants to win and not play too far outside the rules. </p>
<p>Dale Hunter is a young entrepreneur in Montreal running a successful business in the 1980s world of personal computers. He’s having fun and making money until the bad guys arrive. Now he has to try to survive without playing by gangster rules. It will require courage and creativity and the support of some new friends.</p>
<p>While fighting off the criminals, he still has to manage challenges from his employees and customers, the bank and his partners, and his two suppliers in Korea and Taiwan.  He has to make deals with them all to survive and save his business and his family.</p>
<p>It starts with a demand for protection money and threats of violence to his family. Hunter agrees to make payments to a gangster named Jacques Talbot. But the pressure increases as Talbot squeezes him for more. Hunter decides to call the cops. That’s a mistake and the criminals raise their demands and the threats to his family. Hunter makes a deal with Frank the Fixer, a tough young Somalian refugee who now works on both sides of the law in Montreal. He can be more creative than the cops, but his first attempt to take out Talbot makes matters worse. Hunter tries to deal with the gangsters himself and only digs himself in deeper again. Frank and Hunter decide the solution is to raise the stakes with and ask the Montreal Mafia to take care of the other gangsters.</p>
<p>Hunter also appeals to his banker, his partners and his suppliers for help, but he is still not safe from the gangsters and he’s now caught between the first gang of thugs and the Mafia.  Somebody is going to get killed. Dale Hunter may never get back to business as usual.</p>

<h3>The Dale Hunter Series of Crime Novels </h3>
<p>The Dale Hunter novels are stories of an entrepreneur's adventures with exciting drama, crime and suspense for an entertaining read by a wide audience. Without detracting from being a good read, the books are also interesting, informative and inspiring for hard-working entrepreneurs, for future entrepreneurs and for critics of entrepreneurs. (That's the subtle hidden agenda. Hopefully, it doesn't spoil your enjoyment of the novels!)</p>
<h3><strong>The Author - Delvin Chatterson </strong></h3>
<p>Del Chatterson is an entrepreneur and business advisor, consultant, coach and cheerleader for entrepreneurs. He has written extensively on business topics for two decades. He is now writing fiction with a short story collection and this series of Dale Hunter crime novels in progress. </p>
<p>Del has already published two business books: <strong>Don’t Do It the Hard Way</strong>, <i>A wise man learns from the mistakes of others, only a fool insists on making his own </i>and <strong>The Complete Do-It-Yourself Guide to Business Plans, </strong><i>It's about the process, not the  product. </i>Both business books tell real-life stories of entrepreneurs to share the lessons they have learned.</p>
<p>Like Dale Hunter, Del Chatterson is an engineer from UBC with an MBA from McGill and ran a computer products distribution business in Montreal in the 1980’s.  Some of the stories in his first novel of the Dale Hunter series, <strong>No Easy Money,</strong> actually happened, most are fiction. “They’re all my worst nightmares,” he says, “that I decided to share through these imagined stories of crime and violence.”   </p>
<p>Originally from the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Del has lived and worked for most of the past forty years in the fascinating, multicultural, bilingual, French-Canadian city of Montreal, Quebec. He is dedicated to sharing his ideas, experience and advice with entrepreneurs to help improve their lives and their businesses. He has helped entrepreneurs around the world, including volunteer consulting and financial support in developing economies and in Aboriginal communities. His own life experience includes running nine marathons after the age of fifty (setting no records, but never being last) and running for Member of Parliament in the 2000 Canadian Federal election. (He came second, not last.)</p>

<h3>Цель проекта и его бенефициары</h3>
<p>Невозможность читать создаёт проблемы в любом возрасте, но особенно важно умение читать длинные тексты и концентрироваться на содержании - для детей и подростков в период обучения. Невозможно переоценить важность  метода или инструмента облегчающего процесс чтения для дислексиков. Шрифт Боэра и набранные с его помощью книги, является одним из таких инструментов. Это практически доказано на примере его англоязычной версии. </p>

Невозможность читать создаёт проблемы в любом возрасте, но особенно важно умение читать длинные тексты и концентрироваться на содержании - для детей и подростков в период обучения. Невозможно переоценить важность  метода или инструмента облегчающего процесс чтения для дислексиков. Шрифт Боэра и набранные с его помощью книги, является одним из таких инструментов. Это практически доказано на примере его англоязычной версии. 

На что требуется деньги
1 Разработать кириллическую версию шрифта Боэра для всех основных компьютерных операционных систем.2 Сделать кодировку шрифта для основных операционных систем и мобильных устройств.Разработать по возможности приложение позволяющее использовать шрифт для клавиатуры.
3 Вёрстка и дизайн первых книг с использованием разработанного шрифта

<p>Coffee Break is a book.  However, it is also an avenue to help women
embrace their truth (flaws and all), in order to walk freely as the individual
God created them to be.  Coffee Break was
created to recover hope, courage, and strength. 
Coffee Break was created to restore value and worth where they have been
depleted.  Coffee Break was created to be
and to give rest after much labor. 
Coffee Break was created to show women how to inhale and exhale in the
freedom of living life abundantly.  And,
in this freedom, women combine their unique individuality with other
distinctive individuals for a collaborative effort in building unity among both
women and men.  </p>
<p> <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Simply put…Coffee Break is more than
just a book; </span><i style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>it’s a united movement</i><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>. </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Where did Coffee Break come from?</b></p>
<p>Coffee Break began as an intimate
woman-to-woman break from everyday life. 
It was a way for two women to connect and get to know one another apart
from the labor of nurturing others. 
Eventually, those coffee breaks revealed how each individual woman first
needed to get to know the woman in the mirror. 
Who is that woman?  </p>
<p> <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Most women learn more about others
before they discover the true essence of who they are.  They learn to nurture and develop the dreams
of those they love before realizing that God created them to dream as
well.  Most times women relinquish the
spirit of their truth to cultivate the truth of another.  I was once that woman.  Yet, in August 2014 I finally looked at the
woman in the mirror.  I was on vacation
in Chicago with my family and I woke up one morning feeling I had given all I
could.  I was frustrated, resentful,
angry, and hurt.  So, I went to the
mirror and asked the Lord, “What about me?” 
His answer was sweet and simple, “I have not forgotten.  Now write.” 
And, Coffee Break was born. </span></p>
<p> <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>As I began to write, I began to see
the need for me to learn me, to love me, and to purposely listen to He who is
within me.  God’s truth of who I AM was
exposed every time I took a break from life to write.  The more I did what I was purposed to do, the
more I discovered my true character.  As
I surrendered and embraced each individual part of my truth, I was empowered by
His Spirit.  Now, I AM whole and empowered
by God to empower others. </span></p>

<p><b>What is Woman?</b>  </p>
<p>“<i>And the rib, which the Lord God
had taken from man, made He a woman</i>…” 
</p>
<p><b>Genesis 2:22 KJV</b>  </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Woman’s structural foundation was
formed of a rib.  The rib has 3 major
functions, which are to protect, to support, and to respire.  It’s structured to enclose and protect the
heart, lungs, and other vital organs.  It
has a very strong framework to support the muscles that are attached to the
shoulder, chest, upper abdomen, and back. 
And, the rib is very flexible for the purpose of expanding and contracting
for air to flow freely through the respiratory system.  In order for the Body to live effectively,
each of these units must function simultaneously.  Yet, what happens if there is a <i>break</i>
in the rib?  </p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>A broken or fractured rib is
typically caused by a fall or direct blow to the chest.  If a blow to the chest is hard enough to
break the ribs, it could also injure the lungs, spleen, blood vessels, and
other major parts of the Body.  The most
common injury, when there are multiple breaks in the ribs, is a punctured or
collapsed lung.  The broken area
surrounding the lungs is unable to hold its shape making it difficult for air
to flow into the lungs.  Breathing
becomes extremely painful because the muscles, used for breathing, pull on the
ribs causing abnormalities in breathing. 
The abnormal breathing can then lead to </span><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><i>feelings</i></b><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> of
restlessness, anxiety, confusion, and sometimes even fear.  Sound familiar?</span></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>The healing process for broken ribs
is unique and amazing.  They actually
heal on their own over time and are treated in the comfort of one’s home.  During the healing process, it is important
to continue with regular activity such as coughing and deep breathing, as this
can prevent the risk of pneumonia or a collapsed lung.  Oddly enough, it is best to lie on the
injured side, as this allows one to breathe more deeply.  And, the presence of pain is necessary to
determine the progress of one’s healing.

order to respire (inhale &amp; exhale) so that faith, hope, and love can flow
freely through her.  So, what is
woman?  </span><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Truth</b><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>: WOMAN – a

<p>The spirit of giving is
contagious.  When people believe in what

<p>With any project there are always
various risk and challenges with most of them being centered on finances and
marketing.  Those who financially support
the project (including the project founder), take the risk of funding something
that may or may not do well.  Then, there
is the challenge of properly knowing how to market both the project and the
product.  Along with these, there are
three possible risks and three possible challenges this project may face in the
coming months and beyond.</p>
<p><b>Three Possible Risks</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Vulnerability</b> – when one executes a personal project based
on uplifting a group of people intertwined with a strong spiritual belief in
God, they risk being susceptible to people’s negative opinions.  Therefore, the individual must have a strong
support system and truly believe that they are and/or have the solution to a
growing problem.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Time</b> – there are few things that are truly
priceless and time is one of them.  The
risk of losing time, wasting time, and running out of time is and always will
be a major risk for any project.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Misinterpretation</b> – everyone has their own perception of any
given thing and because of this, projects like Coffee Break take the risk of
being categorized with one’s opinion of similar projects, which actually speak
in a completely different tone.  </p>
<p><b>Three Possible Challenges</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Remaining
Authentic</b> –
it is important for this project to listen and regard the ideas of its funders,
followers, and fans as their ideas may be the catalyst of this project’s
success.  However, it is also imperative
that every artist remain genuine to their authentic artistry.  The challenge is balanced by knowing how to
shift to meet the needs of the audience while remaining an original.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Execution
&amp; Management</b> –
developing a team of diverse and strategic leaders is an essential element for
proper execution and management of any project. 
The challenge is embracing ones own weaknesses and learning to trust the
strengths of others in order to place the right person in the correct position.  <br/>
</p><p>·<span> 
</span><b>Maintaining
Momentum</b> -
enthusiasm fades over time when there is a lack of personal engagement.  If properly launched, campaign projects
eventually receive quite a bit of public exposure and community involvement,
which is a great benefit.  Nevertheless,
keeping the community’s interest requires more than zeal and passion, it takes
much follow-up and follow-through.  </p>
<p>Accurately identifying risk and
challenges before beginning a project leads to proper planning, which prevents
poor performance.  The planning of this
project was developed by a team of women who truly believe in its success and
the ultimate goal of creating a united movement for women and men of all ages
and cultures.  </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Your support of this project will be
greatly appreciated by me and my team. 
Yet, more than that, it will be a way for us to improve value and worth
in women to strengthen our present and future generations.  Studies show that empowered women, who are
strongly supported, positively benefits multiple families, various communities,
and other countries.  Simply put, <i>empowering
women empowers the whole world</i>.  It
is our hope that after reviewing this project it will inspire you to fully and
honestly assess your communities.  In
this assessment, I am sure you will find there is a great need for women of all
ages to be emotionally, mentally, and spiritually empowered. </p><p>Thank you for your time, your desire to give, your contributions and for viewing this campaign! Have a well-balanced day!!!</p><p>Much Love, </p><p>The Coffee Lady</p><br/></div>","What is Coffee Break?  
Coffee Break is a book.  However, it is also an avenue to help women
embrace their truth (flaws and all), in order to walk freely as the individual
God created them to be.  Coffee Break was
created to recover hope, courage, and strength. 
Coffee Break was created to restore value and worth where they have been
depleted.  Coffee Break was created to be
and to give rest after much labor. 
Coffee Break was created to show women how to inhale and exhale in the
freedom of living life abundantly.  And,
in this freedom, women combine their unique individuality with other
distinctive individuals for a collaborative effort in building unity among both
women and men.  
 Simply put…Coffee Break is more than
just a book; it’s a united movement. 

Where did Coffee Break come from?
Coffee Break began as an intimate
woman-to-woman break from everyday life. 
It was a way for two women to connect and get to know one another apart
from the labor of nurturing others. 
Eventually, those coffee breaks revealed how each individual woman first
needed to get to know the woman in the mirror. 
Who is that woman?  
 Most women learn more about others
before they discover the true essence of who they are.  They learn to nurture and develop the dreams
of those they love before realizing that God created them to dream as
well.  Most times women relinquish the
spirit of their truth to cultivate the truth of another.  I was once that woman.  Yet, in August 2014 I finally looked at the
woman in the mirror.  I was on vacation
in Chicago with my family and I woke up one morning feeling I had given all I
could.  I was frustrated, resentful,
angry, and hurt.  So, I went to the
mirror and asked the Lord, “What about me?” 
His answer was sweet and simple, “I have not forgotten.  Now write.” 
And, Coffee Break was born. 
 As I began to write, I began to see
the need for me to learn me, to love me, and to purposely listen to He who is
within me.  God’s truth of who I AM was
exposed every time I took a break from life to write.  The more I did what I was purposed to do, the
more I discovered my true character.  As
I surrendered and embraced each individual part of my truth, I was empowered by
His Spirit.  Now, I AM whole and empowered
by God to empower others. 
  Read an Excerpt & More About Coffee Break Coffee Break: Let the Truth Sting 
Who Am I? 
My name is Letitia Doss aka The Coffee Lady.  I am the LEO of
Coffee Break and Double U (W).  W  is a women’s empowerment program created
through Verbal Solutions, developed to give a double portion of “Val-U” to
women in order for them to see themselves as valuable.  Through the development of W and the
writing of Coffee Break, I discovered the truth of who I AM in Christ.  
I AM a wife, an author-prenuer,
mother, advocate, sister, caretaker, friend, encourager, consultant, aunt,
speaker, daughter, assistant…the list can go on and on, but before I am any of
these titles, I AM WOMAN. 
 

What is Woman?  
“And the rib, which the Lord God
had taken from man, made He a woman…” 

Genesis 2:22 KJV  
 

Woman’s structural foundation was
formed of a rib.  The rib has 3 major
functions, which are to protect, to support, and to respire.  It’s structured to enclose and protect the
heart, lungs, and other vital organs.  It
has a very strong framework to support the muscles that are attached to the
shoulder, chest, upper abdomen, and back. 
And, the rib is very flexible for the purpose of expanding and contracting
for air to flow freely through the respiratory system.  In order for the Body to live effectively,
each of these units must function simultaneously.  Yet, what happens if there is a break
in the rib?  
A broken or fractured rib is
typically caused by a fall or direct blow to the chest.  If a blow to the chest is hard enough to
break the ribs, it could also injure the lungs, spleen, blood vessels, and
other major parts of the Body.  The most
common injury, when there are multiple breaks in the ribs, is a punctured or
collapsed lung.  The broken area
surrounding the lungs is unable to hold its shape making it difficult for air
to flow into the lungs.  Breathing
becomes extremely painful because the muscles, used for breathing, pull on the
ribs causing abnormalities in breathing. 
The abnormal breathing can then lead to feelings of
restlessness, anxiety, confusion, and sometimes even fear.  Sound familiar?
The healing process for broken ribs
is unique and amazing.  They actually
heal on their own over time and are treated in the comfort of one’s home.  During the healing process, it is important
to continue with regular activity such as coughing and deep breathing, as this
can prevent the risk of pneumonia or a collapsed lung.  Oddly enough, it is best to lie on the
injured side, as this allows one to breathe more deeply.  And, the presence of pain is necessary to
determine the progress of one’s healing. 
“Time heals all wounds.” So as the pain subsides, strength is
restored. 
Many women have been broken by the
falls and blows of life and have been unable to hold their shape
(original nature and form).  This
brokenness has lead to a misrepresentation of what it truly means to be
woman.  Like the rib, the woman was
created to protect what is most vital, love, for sustaining life.  She is fashioned with an array of emotions to
support the muscles (relationships) by well-balancing those emotions.  Finally, woman is shaped to be flexible in
order to respire (inhale & exhale) so that faith, hope, and love can flow
freely through her.  So, what is
woman?  Truth: WOMAN – a
protector, a supporter, a respirator. 
However, the brokenness of woman has falsified the true state of her
being; but by His stripes, she is healed! 
Woman, Coffee Break is intended to
assist in the healing process.  It is
time to go home, back to the beginning, to confront, accept, and embrace your
truth.  Then, allow God to reveal His
Truth concerning you.  You are stronger
than you think.  You have all you

<p>You may have noticed that the upper limit of our word count is <br/>15k - that's 15,000 / fifteen thousand - words.</p>
<p>Our (lunatic) reasoning for this was manifold: the stories could be longer, meaning more adventure; the writers could have space to better develop their characters; the book itself really could be a <i>Great Big Book of Awesome!</i></p>
<p>Mostly, however, it was because the Publisher of Clan Destine Press is a novelist <br/>and can't write a short story to 'save her life'. <br/>She figured many of the other novelists being invited <br/>might be of the same inclination.</p>

</div></div>","Clan Destine Press

An independent Australian publisher specialising in genre fiction

www.clandestinepress.com.au

Our Clan already includes:

Kerry Greenwood, Alison Goodman,  Jason Nahrung, Narrelle M Harris,  Fin J Ross, David Greagg, Emilie Collyer, Mary Borsellino, Sarah Evans, Lindy Cameron, Amanda Wrangles,  and many more!



So...

In a fit of lunacy we decided to invite members of our Clan and a host of other Aussie and Kiwi genre writersto play in our first adventure anthology sandpit.


And Then... 


the Great Big Book of Awesome Adventure Tales

will be just that – a great big book of cross-genre adventure stories.
We asked the writers to gird the loins of not one, but two heroes.
And then... 
Slap on their white hats – or their black hats or purple turbans; and heft their sword, buckle their swash, or lock&load their explodey things.
And then... 
Raise sails, stoke engines, calibrate warp drives, fuel rockets, saddle horses (or camels or alpacas) or dial time machines – in search of adventure.

We asked for stories of 5k to 15k words in any genre or mix of genres; there had to be 'something' Australian' (or New Zealandy) about the story or its characters, and it had to be page-turning action. 

Ideally we want to uncover latent passion or nurture an addiction for writing cliffhanging adventure tales because – apart from publishing a kickarse action-packed collection of wonder-filled tales with fabulous heroes – we are hoping that some authors might be inclined to develop their characters into an ongoing series of novellas.

What We Have 

You may have noticed that the upper limit of our word count is 15k - that's 15,000 / fifteen thousand - words.
Our (lunatic) reasoning for this was manifold: the stories could be longer, meaning more adventure; the writers could have space to better develop their characters; the book itself really could be a Great Big Book of Awesome!
Mostly, however, it was because the Publisher of Clan Destine Press is a novelist and can't write a short story to 'save her life'. She figured many of the other novelists being invited might be of the same inclination.
We have already accepted submissions from 26 authors.
There are more authors in our inbox awaiting selection.

What We Need
Most of the so-far accepted manuscripts have come in around the 10k to 15k – which is great; it's what we wanted... but now we need to pay everyone. 
The rate we offered was 5 cents per word. That's a lot of little coins for so many fabulous writers who've flung almost-novella-length adventures at us.
It also means that:  
And Then... the great big book of awesome
will probably have to be a two-volume publication.
Which is truly awesome... but we still need to pay everyone.
So, what we need is to raise the funds to pay the contributors.
Each author will also be given an illustrated title page of their very own.
That means we also need to pay an illustrator.
Our illustrator is Vicky Pratt
www.vicpratt.wix.com/vickypratt 
The pencil drawing below is the first of our title page illustrationsIt's for Come Now, Traveller by Amanda Wrangles..




Everything else – editing, proofing, design & layout, printing – gets done(as per usual) from the Clan Destine coffers.
So we need $18,000 to cover writers' fees and illustrations
That's where you all come in.

What you get
We have a range of funding levels with a host of perks that go with each.
You all get something for the something you contribute, depending on the level you opt into. The somethings could be:
* a thank you on our website * the eBooks of And Then... * the paperbacks of And Then...  * eBooks/paperbacks of other Clan Destine Press titles 
* a scene of your own genre fiction critiqued by one of the anthology authors... 
To the Grand Poobah of perks:* the limited-edition hardcovers of And Then...

Getting the word out
 If you can't afford any of the levels but would still like to help get this Great Big Book of Awesome on the road then feel free to share our campaign all over social media. The more mentions, shares, likes and tweets we get, the better.

doing this primarily for my children. Even though this project has 
grown far beyond its original goals, the intention has 
remained the same: to pass on the story of my life to those I love... and anyone else who 
cares to read it.</p>You have seen the pitch video... <b><a href=""http://legallyblindthebook.com/index.php/blog/short-stories"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here are a few (very short) clips from interviews where Duncan does a little story telling</a>.</b><br/><br/><p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This
 project is initiated by friends of Duncan Stroud to allow him to
 finish his autobiography, which he has been working on for many years.  
We are asking for funding so he can work 
full time on finishing and publishing his autobiography, which he 
estimates will take about nine months. The breakdown is pretty simple: 
approximately $15,000 to cover the most basic living costs,  and the rest for 
the editors, producers, publishers, and server fees (for the book's 
website <a href=""http://legallyblindthebook.com%29."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://legallyblindthebook.com).</a> If the goal is not reached what is available will be used for exactly the same purpose for as long as possible. <br/></p><p>As for perks, well, I tried to get as creative as I could given what I have to contribute. The only other thing I could offer was free tango lesson in Buenos Aires, but as this is difficult to redeem, it doesn't really work. However, the offer stands.  If you donate AND you come to Buenos Aires, I'll teach you to dance tango like a true <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/porte%C3%B1o"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">porteño</a> and bring you to the <i>real</i> <a data-new-link=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Milonga_%28place%29"" data-noreplace=""1"" href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Milonga_%28place%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">milongas</a>.<br/></p><p></p> <p> </p><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Duncan's
 story is not simply an autobiography—it is an insight into a world 
we rarely get to see so intimately, the world of those who live in the 
(autistic) spectrum.  For Duncan this perception of the world did 
not stop at the borders of reality, but extended into other worlds, 
other realities. Whether these perceptions were the creations of a 
fevered brain or true insight into alternative dimensions is left to the
 reader. What is unquestionable is how our society is unprepared to 
deal with or understand ""Spectrum People"" while at the same time 
desperately in need of what they have to teach us.</p>
<p>For the spiritually minded, Duncan's story is a journey that leads 
him to the hidden Shangri-La that awaits all of us, eventually.  For the more Cartesian readers, it is the story of a hapless misfit who trips from 
one unfortunate adventure into another until he finally finds himself at
 the bottom of deep hole declaring himself ""the luckiest man in the 
world."" </p><p><br/></p><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Assuming Duncan does not get run over by an Argentine bus driver, the
 only real risk is that the book itself is simply not that good. This 
risk in mitigated by the fact that our team includes a business manager,
 a graphic designer, a journalist, and an editor, 
who work with Duncan to review his writing and shape the book.

website http://legallyblindthebook.com). If the goal is not reached what is available will be used for exactly the same purpose for as long as possible. As for perks, well, I tried to get as creative as I could given what I have to contribute. The only other thing I could offer was free tango lesson in Buenos Aires, but as this is difficult to redeem, it doesn't really work. However, the offer stands.  If you donate AND you come to Buenos Aires, I'll teach you to dance tango like a true porteño and bring you to the real milongas.  The Impact Duncan's
 story is not simply an autobiography—it is an insight into a world 
we rarely get to see so intimately, the world of those who live in the 
(autistic) spectrum.  For Duncan this perception of the world did 
not stop at the borders of reality, but extended into other worlds, 
other realities. Whether these perceptions were the creations of a 
fevered brain or true insight into alternative dimensions is left to the
 reader. What is unquestionable is how our society is unprepared to 
deal with or understand ""Spectrum People"" while at the same time 
desperately in need of what they have to teach us.
For the spiritually minded, Duncan's story is a journey that leads 
him to the hidden Shangri-La that awaits all of us, eventually.  For the more Cartesian readers, it is the story of a hapless misfit who trips from 
one unfortunate adventure into another until he finally finds himself at
 the bottom of deep hole declaring himself ""the luckiest man in the 
world.""  Risks & Challenges
Assuming Duncan does not get run over by an Argentine bus driver, the
 only real risk is that the book itself is simply not that good. This 
risk in mitigated by the fact that our team includes a business manager,
 a graphic designer, a journalist, and an editor, 
who work with Duncan to review his writing and shape the book.  

Here are some links to excerpts from the first draft:
Terrorists and Tango
The Ant God
Boy Scouts
Tannery
Rome
More of the book's excerpts and blog posts by Duncan can be found at the website, http://legallyblindthebook.com.

We were able to finish all of the work, to the levels we wanted, and the recipes and photos are ""in the can,"" as they say.

<h3><strong>Summary &amp; Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This is more than just a children’s book - it’s a tribute to my late husband, Bari Greenberg.  The lessons in the story are the ones Bari would have personally passed on to our son, Aidan, had Bari not died suddenly in 2014.  So part of this is to give Aidan that connection to his father.</p>
<p>But it’s also something I believe children need to hear in this day of super hero popularity.  The message they can be heroic, too, just by being kind, honest, and thoughtful.</p>
<p>Bari was brilliant but socially awkward growing up.  He was bullied and picked on often, but instead of retaliating or turning bitter, he told me he made the conscious choice to always “be the hero”, which I thought was extraordinary for a child to have decided.  When our son was born 5 months after Bari died, I knew I wanted that lesson passed on to Aidan.  It took me 2 years to write the book and another 2 years to find the right artist.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Now that we are nearing the layout and print stages, it's time to seek funding.  That’s where I'm hoping you come in.  Not only can you get the book for yourself and the children in your life, but you can bring this message to any group of children to whom you wish to gift it.  Teachers are always in need of more books in their classrooms, especially ones with positive messages.  <i><strong>You can give one book to a class, enough for a reading group, or even gift one book to each child in a grade level.</strong></i></p>
<p>Funds will be used for production costs, and to reimburse what I have already invested in this project, including paying my artist, Kathryn McGehee.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>The biggest risks are the ones I’ve already taken.  This project is important to me, and while I hope to get back my financial investment, the project will be completed even if I don’t reach my goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Please share this campaign with anyone you think may be interested!  I would love to see this book in the hands of as many children as possible.</p>

The biggest risks are the ones I’ve already taken.  This project is important to me, and while I hope to get back my financial investment, the project will be completed even if I don’t reach my goal.

<h3>Summary—</h3>
<p>I'm Heidi Green: a writer and artist, and I'm writing a book!</p>
<p>This is the incredible story of a Zookeeper's daughter, born in Burma almost a century ago, who is forced to seek refuge in a monastery during WWII. Based on historic events, it is an inspiring story of one girl's journey to find courage, redemption, and even magic, in the midst of war.  </p>

<p><br/><strong>February Research and writing Trip to Myanmar — $4k+ AUD </strong></p>
<p>Costs include flights ($450AUD), visas ($150AUD), insurance ($50), accommodation ($400++) and travel expenses ($600+) of a one month budget tour of all story locations: to interview, document, research, source historic documents, and fact check. The final portion of this trip ($2500AUD), involves a very unique intensive ten day political/spiritual/cultural tour behind closed doors of Myanmar. I will be introduced to some of the founding monks and monasteries of modern Buddhism, political leaders, and be invited into the private home of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's political leader and daughter of Major-General Aung San (who led the Burmese rebellion during WWII and will feature in my book). This tour will be joined by my mentor, Alan Clements; a Buddhist monk, political journalist, activist and author of 40 years based in Burma, and the entire trip will play an invaluable role in establishing the hidden stories, culture, locations and  characters of Myanmar, which will shape my story. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577284890/tuam3l43lrx4sos2wmoh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/><strong>Editing, Illustration + Publishing costs — $6-15k++</strong></p>
<p>The costs of producing any piece of print can vary wildly, depending on volume, printing style, paper and binding. I will be looking at a minimum of $6-10k AUD+ as a starting price for an illustrated book. The more money I raise, the higher the quality of printing and volume. After printing, I will work with a distributor to stock my book in Singapore, Bali and Australia, followed by a promotional campaign and launch (the costs of which are not included here yet). I will also need to raise money to pay for proofreading and editing of the book (costs not included) along with illustrating all images myself based on historic documents, using watercolour canvases. These material costs sit around $300-600. </p>
<p>In total these costs could be anywhere from $10-20K+ AUD, and these are hard costs, not including my time in writing, illustrating, or getting feedback from my writer friends. So in short, whatever money I raise during this crowdfunding campaign will all help! <br/> </p>

<br/>Risks, Challenges + Experience—</h3>
<p>There is always the risk that things won't go according to plan in a complex project like this, however, I have great faith in the process, for several reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing Experience —</strong></p>
<p>Despite being a debut novelist, I have worked for almost two decades in the publishing and design industries, creating numerous publications, books, magazines and print projects from start to finish for agencies, clients, and my own design studio. I've won awards, separately, for all of my illustrations, writing and printed design work. I work well under pressure, and truly believe that the complexity of this project will bring out the best in my diverse skills. </p>
<p><strong>Mentorship + Peer support —</strong></p>
<p>Beyond my own experience, I have a brilliant peer support when it comes to writing the book. I have many writer and artist friends, including my closest friend (a talented editor and ex BBC journalist), my writing mentor (a long-time political writer and bestselling author in Myanmar), and my long time advertising copywriter colleague (who is also an award-winning screenwriter and best-selling author).

</div></div>","Summary—
I'm Heidi Green: a writer and artist, and I'm writing a book!
This is the incredible story of a Zookeeper's daughter, born in Burma almost a century ago, who is forced to seek refuge in a monastery during WWII. Based on historic events, it is an inspiring story of one girl's journey to find courage, redemption, and even magic, in the midst of war.  
I'm inviting my community to participate in crowdfunding the production of this book because I believe this is a powerful story that the world needs to hear. Rather than simply ask for donations, I'm offering beautiful artworks, prints and books in exchange to those who support.
Artworks will be provided upfront. Presale books will be shipped AFTER the book production is complete. (Artworks are listed at the bottom of the page).  



What is needed—
Writing and researching a century-old story, based in a closed-off country that has been at war for 80 years, is a challenge. I initially spent one week in Myanmar, undertaking the preliminary research and story outline, but in order to  finish the book, I must now return to Myanmar in February. I'll walk through my story's journey, fact check historic details, research characters and locations on site. I will then need to cover costs of editing, proofing, illustrating and self publishing the book. Basic costs are as follows.

February Research and writing Trip to Myanmar — $4k+ AUD 
Costs include flights ($450AUD), visas ($150AUD), insurance ($50), accommodation ($400++) and travel expenses ($600+) of a one month budget tour of all story locations: to interview, document, research, source historic documents, and fact check.

This tour will be joined by my mentor, Alan Clements; a Buddhist monk, political journalist, activist and author of 40 years based in Burma, and the entire trip will play an invaluable role in establishing the hidden stories, culture, locations and  characters of Myanmar, which will shape my story. 
Editing, Illustration + Publishing costs — $6-15k++
The costs of producing any piece of print can vary wildly, depending on volume, printing style, paper and binding. I will be looking at a minimum of $6-10k AUD+ as a starting price for an illustrated book. The more money I raise, the higher the quality of printing and volume.

Additional writing not included in the public release version, including the story behind my accidental discovery and all four scientific papers and three studies supporting the emotional selection theory of dreaming.
Please Help!Discovering and exploring the root source of dreaming was an undertaking much larger than myself. Several people have generously helped me over the years including psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists. My Somerville writers group, friends, and family have spent countless hours helping me turn my theory into words for a general audience.Charles Darwin's theory was simple, so he wrote On The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection for the general public. My dream theory is equally simple, so I too wrote Emotional Selection: Dreams, Dreaming, and the Nightly Evolution of your Mind for the general public.My book manuscript is done, but I need your help to hire editors and other publishing professionals to make my book a reality.Please consider purchasing a perk on this page. If you have friends or family who are interested in dreams or might be interested in helping me attain my dream, please use the share tools on this page to spread the word.Thank you!-RichP.S.If there's a Perk you'd like that's not listed (e.g., bundle X4), or if you'd just like to get in touch, please email me at richard@richardcoutts.com.",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Caro. I’m a trained communications designer, art psychotherapist and family therapist with a great passion for books. I discovered my dream job by combining the skills of my professional backgrounds to create psychosocial media that benefits young people and the professionals who work with them.</p>
<p>As a therapist I've worked extensively with teenage girls and have supported them through their struggles. I also still remember my own puberty and how frightening it felt when my body started to change. Suddenly there was a great deal of pressure to look a certain way: you had to shave your legs and armpits, stay in shape, wear make-up, ... and then there was menstruation to deal with. Bleeding definitely seemed to be something embarrassing, something one had to hide while it was happening. I still remember a blood stain on the bottom of a fellow student's jeans at school. The whole class was laughing about it. She looked terrified.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616006846/nerjnvva6egmywocsf4o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Today, times are slowly changing, but many teenage girls are still embarrassed about their bodies and feel the need to hide their cycles. I want to create this book because I strongly believe that girls can learn to embrace their menstruation and develop a sense of pride for who they are. We can all help them gain agency and start a conversation on a wider social level.</p>
<p>Girls can be encouraged to define their very own rite of passage on their journey to womanhood (whatever that may mean to them, individually). My goal is to spread this message as widely as possible and to reach teenage girls in different parts of the world. <br/>Please support this project in order to help me create and independently publish the book in both German and English.</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>I decided to turn to crowdfunding because I want to start a healthy conversation about menstruation to stop ignorance and body shaming. Sharing the creation process on social media will hopefully raise awareness for this important topic.  We can all support teenage girls in gaining greater agency through their bodies by embracing their menstruation and cycles.</p>
<p>Your support will help me to create and independently and widely publish the book in both German and English. Self-publishing will allow me to keep full control over the content. This is important to me, as I would like to keep this project free of commercial interference. I have long-standing experience in editorial design as well as an extensive network of professional colleagues (including therapists and human rights workers, amongst others) many of whom have agreed to support this project. I also intend to closely work with girls throughout the entire process. </p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>     This funding campaign is for the first of three books I want to create to preserve the hidden history of my hometown of Coeburn, Virginia. This tiny corner of the Appalachian Mountains has, at various times, been the center of geologic violence, a hunter's paradise, a farmer's haven, and a wild-west boomtown. The sum of the drama that has occurred in this one little spot on the globe is nearly unimaginable. </p>
<p>     For the past nine years I have sought out every story and fact I could possibly find about the history of Coeburn and surrounding communities. I've scoured online archives, traveled to libraries and courthouses in multiple states, and conducted personal interviews with people in-the-know. Some of my findings, in short form, have already been shared on Coeburn Reflector. But many others have not, especially the longer stories. So I think now is the perfect time to put them to paper and ink, so that others can enjoy them too. </p>
<p>     This campaign is designed to raise money to complete my research and publish the first of the three volume work. The information for the first volume has been gathered from numerous places over a period of years, and some of it was very difficult to find. Certain info is not available unless you dig through obscure records in courthouses and university archives. And a few of the things learned from interviews and correspondence are totally unique, and unavailable anywhere else. I believe this info should be gathered and put into print form, so that everyone who reads the book will get a better understanding of what life in Coeburn was really like for our ancestors. </p>
<p>     Your support for this project will help create a special history book that both you and future generations will be able to enjoy. I really hope to see these books being read in local schools, libraries, and many homes. And you get to help make that happen. </p>
<h2>
<br/>About The Author: </h2>
<p>     I grew up on Caney Ridge, just inside Dickenson County, but attended elementary and high schools in Coeburn. I also lived in Coeburn when I first got married and started a family. So even though I have not resided there for decades, I do still have kinfolk there, and Coeburn will always be my hometown. </p>
<p>    Almost all my professional experience has been in the engineering and entertainment fields, so I am sure there are others who are more qualified to write a history book. My writing has thus far been limited to a few songs, essays, and short film scripts, and my publishing experience can be summarized as the editing and layout of a single biography and its two subsequent revisions.<br/><br/>     I am also not a trained historian, but local history has been my serious hobby for about thirty years. So a great deal of my free time has gone into digging out tiny nuggets of the past, anywhere I could find them. Now and then, the tedium made it feel a bit like wasting time, but sooner or later I would run across some marvelous story that had been forgotten for ages, and I felt instantly captivated again. <br/><br/>     ""So who were these people that came before us?""  </p>
<p>     ""Well, they were exactly like us. Except, different."" </p>
<p>     For me, history seems like a mysterious, fuzzy window into the past, that somehow doubles as a shaky crystal ball into the future. And I love to peek through both. </p>
<h2>
<br/>What We Need: </h2>
<p>     To make this project work, we will need the support of many others who also feel a connection to Coeburn, Virginia. We need not only your financial support, but also your participation and encouragement. <br/><br/>     And we certainly need your best gossip. We want you to tell anyone who will listen, ""Those people over there are up to something, and you need to see what it is!"" </p>
<h2>
<br/>What You Get: </h2>
<p>     The dollar goal for this campaign is $2,500, which is the minimum I believe it will take to produce and ship the book that I have envisioned. If the campaign should not reach the full dollar amount but does hit the $1,500 mark, then I will still create a book for those who have donated, but will not make any subsequent volumes. And if the campaign should not reach $1,500, then I will either return the funds or extend the campaign deadline. </p>
<p>     Funds raised will go toward research and travel expenses, publishing costs, shipping supplies, and postage to get the perks to you. Due to the initial expense of purchasing ISBN numbers in small quantities, plus the crowdfunding fees, each copy of this first volume will cost about $5.00 more than I wish it did. But the second volume will be less, since the ISBN number and some of the shipping supplies will already have been purchased. </p>
<p>     In addition to the book, there are some unique Coeburn perks available for the smaller contributions. I have tried to make the perks unique and available over a wide range of contribution levels. There is a Coeburn bookmark and four different styles of Coeburn posters that are perks for smaller contributions. And on the other end of the scale, there is a lunch-with-the-author package. But the perk that excites me most is the Library Patron package, which lets you get two books, one for yourself and one to be donated to a library in your name. </p>
<h2>
<br/>Book Design: </h2>
<p>     Instead of making one large, pricey hard-cover book of about 500 pages, I intend to make three smaller soft-cover volumes containing the same material. This will make each volume more economical to produce, quicker to deliver, and more fulfilling to create. Plus, the fans of Coeburn, Virginia will have the option to support either one, two, or all three book projects. </p>
<p>          This particular funding campaign is ONLY for the first volume, but below are the descriptions for all three book projects: <br/> </p>
<p>* Hidden History of Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 1 *</p>
<p>     I have already done most of the research for the first volume, and expect it to be completed within six months. If the project is fully funded, I will travel to the state library in Richmond to gather some specific materials about early Coeburn which have probably not been viewed for a century. Plus, there are a few libraries and courthouses on this end of the state that I want to visit for specific information. </p>
<p>     The first volume will be a 6"" x 9"" soft-cover of about 120 pages, with about 20-30% of the pages having images (i.e. photos, drawings, maps, etc.). This should leave room for a text of about 21,000 words. The book will have self-contained articles of varying lengths, so you will not need to read it from cover-to-cover to enjoy it. <br/> </p>
<p>* Hidden History of Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 2*</p>
<p>     The second volume will be a continuation of the first, with a similar book design, and should be completed about four months after the first. </p>
<p>     There will be a separate funding campaign for the second volume. <br/> </p>
<p>* Hidden History of Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 3 *</p>
<p>     The third volume has a different design, still a soft-cover 6"" x 9"", but having approximately 200-400 pages. It will be a collection of biographical sketches, family stories, and family photos of the people who live, or have lived, in Coeburn communities. Materials for this book will be provided by the families who choose to participate. I will provide guidance about the materials, editing of the photos and text for publication, and putting the book together for publication. </p>
<p>     There will be a separate funding campaign for the third volume. </p>
<h2>
<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges </h2>
<p>     One challenge in publishing a book is to make sure all images used are cleared for copyright purposes. I expect it will be quite a logistical challenge to get permission for all the images, maps, etc. that I want to use in the book. Fortunately, my engineering background provided me with skills to keep track of a large amount of detailed data.  </p>
<p>     But the trickiest thing might actually be delivering all the perks to the backers. There are potentially hundreds of items to be mailed to hundreds of addresses, which leaves plenty of opportunity for a mistake. But we do promise to be very careful, and to promptly fix anything that should go awry. </p>
<h2>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>     People who can't contribute to the fundraiser can still help with this project: </p>
<p>     Please share this campaign on Facebook with your family members, friends, co-workers, and anyone else who might be interested in a book about Coeburn. You can easily do this by clicking on the Facebook icon at the top of the page.<br/><br/>Thank y'all so very much for your encouragement and support!</p>

* Hidden History of Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 2*
     The second volume will be a continuation of the first, with a similar book design, and should be completed about four months after the first. 
     There will be a separate funding campaign for the second volume.  
* Hidden History of Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 3 *
     The third volume has a different design, still a soft-cover 6"" x 9"", but having approximately 200-400 pages. It will be a collection of biographical sketches, family stories, and family photos of the people who live, or have lived, in Coeburn communities. Materials for this book will be provided by the families who choose to participate. I will provide guidance about the materials, editing of the photos and text for publication, and putting the book together for publication. 
     There will be a separate funding campaign for the third volume. 

Risks & Challenges 
     One challenge in publishing a book is to make sure all images used are cleared for copyright purposes. I expect it will be quite a logistical challenge to get permission for all the images, maps, etc. that I want to use in the book. Fortunately, my engineering background provided me with skills to keep track of a large amount of detailed data.  
     But the trickiest thing might actually be delivering all the perks to the backers. There are potentially hundreds of items to be mailed to hundreds of addresses, which leaves plenty of opportunity for a mistake. But we do promise to be very careful, and to promptly fix anything that should go awry. 

Other Ways You Can Help
     People who can't contribute to the fundraiser can still help with this project: 
     Please share this campaign on Facebook with your family members, friends, co-workers, and anyone else who might be interested in a book about Coeburn. You can easily do this by clicking on the Facebook icon at the top of the page.Thank y'all so very much for your encouragement and support!

<p>The book <strong>The Parisian Sphinx</strong>, a mystery and a treasure hunt, is the remarkable true story of the life and lost work of French painter and model Victorine Meurent, who burst onto the 19th century Parisian art scene in a swirl of color and scandal, changing the face of modern art forever. Despite being ridiculed in the press by critics who considered her an abomination, the bold and unconventional Victorine devoted herself to her craft until her own work hung in the same galleries as that of the men who painted her</p>
<p>Art historians initially wrote that she died young as an alcoholic prostitute, penniless and old before her time. None of that was true, but it would be fifty years before modern researchers began to piece Victorine's real life back together again, and another forty before her lost paintings would begin to reappear.</p>
<p>Victorine lived through revolutions, barricades, and war. She traveled overseas. She met and befriended some of the most famous creative minds of her time, hung out at the <i>Moulin Rouge</i>, was spotted among the pioneers of the 19th century Parisian lesbian scene, and was said to be in a love triangle with a courtesan and a Russian prince. The clues of her life hint at an epically scaled tale of passion, determination, and a love that the world wasn't ready to accept.</p>

<p>Since first learning about her more than fifteen years ago, I have been fascinated by the mystery of what really happened to Victorine Meurent and her lost paintings. I hoped that an investigative journalist would be able to bring a different skillset when it came to reconstructing her biography that could complement what was already being done by curators and art historians. The more I dug into her story and the more I discovered about her life, the clearer it became to me why the patriarchal critics and biographers of her time had tried to erase her. Women, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ community have always been an important part of history, but too often their stories are forgotten or intentionally left out. To uncover what really happened and restore the full impact of these individuals' influence can require a process of painstaking excavation—which is what I am trying to do here. It is important to tell these stories as soon as possible before more of the primary documents needed to do so are lost to time.</p>

past to offer new possibilities for its present and future.<br/></p>
<p class=""""><i style="""">The Serpent’s Tail</i>

<p class=""""><b style="""">The tradition needs

<p class=""""><i style="""">The Serpent’s Tail</i>
has been a labor of love and devotion initiated without any sources of funding.<span style="""">  </span>It is so necessary as ninety percent of
Khmer classical dance artists died during a genocide in the 1970s, taking with
them valuable techniques, approaches, and stories.<span style="""">  </span>Since then the art form has existed in a vulnerable and
fragile landscape without proper sources of support.<span style="""">  </span>Khmer people, although they cherish and celebrate the
tradition, often have very little understanding of it because there are very few
written sources of quality.<span style="""">  </span></p>
<p class="""">How can we claim to love something that we do not know?<span style="""">  </span>And how can we take care of and grow
something if we do not comprehend it deep down to its core?<span style="""">  </span>As Chheng Phon, Cambodia’s former
Minister of Culture, has said:<span style="""">  </span></p>
<blockquote><span style="""">“If you do not
know your culture, you cannot bring something new to the culture. People are
the masters and the products of their history.”</span></blockquote>
<p><span style="""">Elaborating on this, Ted Shawn—the father of modern dance—explains why this art form and its history is important for all: </span></p>
<blockquote><span style="""">""Tagore cried in one of his poems, 'Who can strain the blue from the sky?' How can I then, strain from these dances of ancient Khmer their adorable perfume, color and rhythm and bring them home to America? . . . If the dancing in any one country is truly great, it must have been founded on principles which are true everywhere, and thus the study of these principles is of value to every country.""</span></blockquote>

</div></div>","After researching and writing for more than a year, I am near
ready to publish The Serpent’s Tail.  At 156 pages, the project traces the
rich and fascinating history of Khmer classical dance by examining its roots as
a prayer in movement and its more than 1,000-year course of evolution.  Analyzing textual sources and oral
stories, sculpture and painting, photography and video, I invoke the art form’s
past to offer new possibilities for its present and future.
The Serpent’s Tail
will be completely accessible online, free of charge to students, artists,
scholars, and enthusiasts all over the world.  It is an extremely meaningful project as, to my knowledge,
this is the first time a practitioner will be writing an entire history of the ancient art form.  
The tradition needs
you.
The Serpent’s Tail
has been a labor of love and devotion initiated without any sources of funding.  It is so necessary as ninety percent of
Khmer classical dance artists died during a genocide in the 1970s, taking with
them valuable techniques, approaches, and stories.  Since then the art form has existed in a vulnerable and
fragile landscape without proper sources of support.  Khmer people, although they cherish and celebrate the
tradition, often have very little understanding of it because there are very few
written sources of quality.  
How can we claim to love something that we do not know?  And how can we take care of and grow
something if we do not comprehend it deep down to its core?  As Chheng Phon, Cambodia’s former
Minister of Culture, has said:  
“If you do not
know your culture, you cannot bring something new to the culture. People are
the masters and the products of their history.”
Elaborating on this, Ted Shawn—the father of modern dance—explains why this art form and its history is important for all: 
""Tagore cried in one of his poems, 'Who can strain the blue from the sky?' How can I then, strain from these dances of ancient Khmer their adorable perfume, color and rhythm and bring them home to America? . . . If the dancing in any one country is truly great, it must have been founded on principles which are true everywhere, and thus the study of these principles is of value to every country.""

I intend to compile the journey into a table book that people can buy. It'll be a fictional first person account of a serial killer, making his way across the nation and leaving a trail of bodies in his wake.

<h3>Please Allow me to Introduce Myself
</h3>
<p>My name is John J. Dick. I am an alternative horror photographer and video game voice actor. I also enjoy travelling and have spent a good portion of my adult life on motorcycles. It's been a few years since I've been able to travel, though. I've been destitute and without a motorcycle. It feels like a piece of my soul has been missing. I recently bought a beat up old bike, and am chomping at the bit to have an adventure. I could use your help, though.</p>
<p>I want to take my horror photography on the road. I want to travel across the country, setting up bloody photoshoots in a variety of locations. Some historic locations, some mundane. I want to capture the spirit of this great country through the twisted eyes of a guy who has seen too many horror movies. I will also keep a steady instagram feed of the more mundane adventures I go on... perhaps someone will find the day to day details of my journey inspiring. I do tend to go off on some rather strange tangents at times.</p>
<p>The end game for this adventure is to publish a scrapbook of my journey. The scrapbook will be a fictional account of a serial killer. It'll include pictures of the 'murders', as well as notes and memorabilia. Trying to get into the mind of why horrible people do horrible things. It'll be dark... definitely not everyone's cup of tea. But, I like to think there's a little demon inside all of us who secretly fantasizes about what it would be like to live a completely uninhibited and uncaring life. I also like to think that by creating art that plays with these demons, we give ourselves a safe outlet for them.<br/><br/>But, I digress. I'm getting entirely too meta about understanding human motivation. At the basest level, this is about creating something scary. Putting it into a book that you can leave on your coffee table for unsuspecting guests to look at, and question why the hell you would own such a horrible thing. There will be blood, and nudity, and adventure... and perhaps a little insight into the darkest parts of the human spirit.</p>
<p>But I need your help to make this a reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1418756/files/20150427091353-pleasehelp0.jpg?1430151233"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Do I Still Have Your Attention? Good.</span><br/></p>
<p>I'm asking for $3500 for the campaign. It's a modest amount, when you consider everything going into it. Many of these figures are estimates. The specific plans for the trip will be adjusted according to the amount raised.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$600 - Rent and bills while I'm away. I'm going to be taking a break from work for this trip, but still need to make sure I have a place to come back to. I live fairly modestly, and split bills with my roommate. But, I don't want to leave the guy hanging.</li>
<li>$500 - Motorcycle maintenance. I want to make sure the bike is in top shape before I leave. Having the trip cut short because the wheels broke down? Not a good situation to be stuck in.</li>
<li>$1000 - Printing costs for the books. Obviously, this is a rough estimate. I found a site that has a sale on right now... but I might not be able to find that same rate when it comes time to send off the order. Also, quantity and quality play into the final price a lot. I'm going to try to get the best deal that I can to produce a solid finished product for you. $1000 should be enough to get a print run to cover books for my sponsors, even in the worst of conditions.</li>
<li>$1000 - Gas, food and road expenses. Although motorcycles get good gas mileage, we're talking about a lot of distance. Also, I gotta eat along the way. I intend to camp and crash at friend's houses. But, there may be the need to rent the stray hotel room from time to time.</li>
<li>$400 - Just a little extra emergency buffer. I probably should make this amount higher, but I'm pretty resourceful about handling emergencies ;)</li>
<li>$0 - Fake blood. I've been working on my own recipe for fake blood for the past few years. I have designed an inexpensive powder that you just add water to and cook. I can make a gallon of fake blood for less than a dollar, and I already have a huge amount of the powder stockpiled. As much of the stuff as I'll be using, this is still a negligible expense. I've got this bit more than covered.</li>
</ul>
<div>Obviously, I'll also be investing a good chunk of my own money into this endeavor as well, to fill the gaps that I haven't listed above.<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>If I make more than my target amount, any additional money will go toward eating better on the road. Better accommodations. It will allow me to visit more places and do more photoshoots and have more content to give you. It will also go toward buying props for the photoshoots, and making everything generally more and more epic. Perhaps buy a used wedding dress and stage a murdered wedding couple, with a short story of how their happy day ended tragically? Or buy a cheap guitar to use in bludgeoning a metalhead to death (breaking the guitar in the process)?<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>I'd absolutely LOVE to have enough capital that I don't have to worry about micromanaging my budget on the trip, and can just completely indulge in whatever creative fancy crosses my mind. But, that's probably just a pipe dream :)</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1417785/files/20150426234415-pleasehelp4.jpg?1430117055"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What if I Don't Reach My Goal?</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Oh, the trip is still happening. I'm still going to do a roadtrip. I'm still going to make a book. I may have to scale things accordingly. The book might be a little lighter on content. I may only be able to stop in a few places, and stay closer to home. I may have to do multiple pages for each murder to flesh things out. But, come hell or high water, SOMETHING is going to happen. It's up to you and your contribution to decide exactly how epic that something is going to be.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why Travel? Why not just Take These Pics Locally?</span></h3>
<p>Foremost, art needs to be inspired, my friend. I'll be a man on a mission. It's a book about a journey... so I'm going to take a journey. I will use firsthand accounts of things that happen to me along the way to add flavor to the book. I'll take advantage of scenery that can't be found in the Inland Northwest where I live. I'm going to attempt to stage some murders in front of some recognizable areas... though we'll just have to see what I can get away with before the Park Ranger catches me ;)</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>First and foremost: Spread the word. Share the shit out of this campaign. The more visibility I get, the more funding I'll get to help me make this dream a reality.<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>If you've got a place for me to crash along the way, let me know. Couch space... anything. I have a number of friends all over the country who will be willing to put me up for the night. But having more options is never a bad thing. I can't say at this point exactly where the road will lead me. But, if I'm near you, I'd love to meet up. We can go out and grab a couple beers while I'm there. I love meeting new people and absorbing local flavor. As it gets closer to the time for the trip, I'll have a better idea of the exact route I'll be taking and can let people know when to expect me.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>Are you a model? Would you like to be featured in a page of the book? I'm always looking for new models to stage scenes for the book. Let me know if you would like to be involved in a photoshoot. I can get a bit risque'. Many of my photoshoots involve a bit of nudity, if you're comfortable with that. But showing a little skin is entirely optional. I'll stay within your boundaries. Though, you should expect to be covered in a fair bit of fake blood.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>If you can aid me along the road, please do feel free to reach out to me.

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'm just a guy who likes to embrace life and live by the seat of my pants. I'm just a guy with a dream. I like to create things, and share experiences. And, I do feel like I have an artistic vision that is worth sharing. I believe in this project. I really really really do. It may not change the world. But I think that by doing this, it will change mine. And maybe in some small way, make the world a little less scared. When we play nice with our demons, they lose their power. So, what do you say? Let's play?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and thank you for your support.</p>

</div></div>","Update: The Campaign is Over. Long Live the Campaign
We had a good run with our little fundraising campaign. Sadly, we didn't reach our goal. But we made enough to do the campaign on a smaller scale. I'll be adapting the story to be told in a series of short roadtrips across the Nortwestern United States. The Twitter feed is already active at twitter.com/picturesofmeat. If you weren't able to contribute during the fundraiser, but still want access to the twitter feed, we can do that. Simply paypal $5 to me at johnjdick@yahoo.com. Mention in the comments your twitter handle. Then send a follow request to picturesofmeat.

I still have a couple weeks before the funds from the indiegogo campaign are released to me. Right now, the twitter feed is all about building the character up before I tear him apart. I hope you'll join me for the ride. It's gonna be a good one.





If all this is too much to read: 
The short pitch is that I want to create a table book out of a cross country motorcycle adventure. The plan is to do photoshoots all over the country, where I stage murder scenes. I intend to compile the journey into a table book that people can buy. It'll be a fictional first person account of a serial killer, making his way across the nation and leaving a trail of bodies in his wake. Kind of a murderer's scrapbook.In addition to the Gallery link at the top of this page, you can find some examples of my work at Viewbug, Deviant Art, a recently started Flickr page, and also scattered around my Facebook gallery. I've also got a Patreon campaign that I use to supplement my monthly photography projects.



Please Allow me to Introduce Myself

My name is John J. Dick. I am an alternative horror photographer and video game voice actor. I also enjoy travelling and have spent a good portion of my adult life on motorcycles. It's been a few years since I've been able to travel, though. I've been destitute and without a motorcycle. It feels like a piece of my soul has been missing. I recently bought a beat up old bike, and am chomping at the bit to have an adventure. I could use your help, though.
I want to take my horror photography on the road. I want to travel across the country, setting up bloody photoshoots in a variety of locations. Some historic locations, some mundane. I want to capture the spirit of this great country through the twisted eyes of a guy who has seen too many horror movies. I will also keep a steady instagram feed of the more mundane adventures I go on... perhaps someone will find the day to day details of my journey inspiring. I do tend to go off on some rather strange tangents at times.
The end game for this adventure is to publish a scrapbook of my journey. The scrapbook will be a fictional account of a serial killer. It'll include pictures of the 'murders', as well as notes and memorabilia. Trying to get into the mind of why horrible people do horrible things. It'll be dark... definitely not everyone's cup of tea. But, I like to think there's a little demon inside all of us who secretly fantasizes about what it would be like to live a completely uninhibited and uncaring life. I also like to think that by creating art that plays with these demons, we give ourselves a safe outlet for them.But, I digress. I'm getting entirely too meta about understanding human motivation. At the basest level, this is about creating something scary. Putting it into a book that you can leave on your coffee table for unsuspecting guests to look at, and question why the hell you would own such a horrible thing. There will be blood, and nudity, and adventure... and perhaps a little insight into the darkest parts of the human spirit.
But I need your help to make this a reality.




Do I Still Have Your Attention? Good.
I'm asking for $3500 for the campaign. It's a modest amount, when you consider everything going into it. Many of these figures are estimates. The specific plans for the trip will be adjusted according to the amount raised.


$600 - Rent and bills while I'm away. I'm going to be taking a break from work for this trip, but still need to make sure I have a place to come back to. I live fairly modestly, and split bills with my roommate. But, I don't want to leave the guy hanging.
$500 - Motorcycle maintenance. I want to make sure the bike is in top shape before I leave. Having the trip cut short because the wheels broke down? Not a good situation to be stuck in.
$1000 - Printing costs for the books. Obviously, this is a rough estimate. I found a site that has a sale on right now... but I might not be able to find that same rate when it comes time to send off the order. Also, quantity and quality play into the final price a lot. I'm going to try to get the best deal that I can to produce a solid finished product for you. $1000 should be enough to get a print run to cover books for my sponsors, even in the worst of conditions.
$1000 - Gas, food and road expenses. Although motorcycles get good gas mileage, we're talking about a lot of distance. Also, I gotta eat along the way. I intend to camp and crash at friend's houses. But, there may be the need to rent the stray hotel room from time to time.
$400 - Just a little extra emergency buffer. I probably should make this amount higher, but I'm pretty resourceful about handling emergencies ;)
$0 - Fake blood. I've been working on my own recipe for fake blood for the past few years. I have designed an inexpensive powder that you just add water to and cook. I can make a gallon of fake blood for less than a dollar, and I already have a huge amount of the powder stockpiled. As much of the stuff as I'll be using, this is still a negligible expense. I've got this bit more than covered.

Obviously, I'll also be investing a good chunk of my own money into this endeavor as well, to fill the gaps that I haven't listed above.If I make more than my target amount, any additional money will go toward eating better on the road. Better accommodations. It will allow me to visit more places and do more photoshoots and have more content to give you. It will also go toward buying props for the photoshoots, and making everything generally more and more epic. Perhaps buy a used wedding dress and stage a murdered wedding couple, with a short story of how their happy day ended tragically? Or buy a cheap guitar to use in bludgeoning a metalhead to death (breaking the guitar in the process)?I'd absolutely LOVE to have enough capital that I don't have to worry about micromanaging my budget on the trip, and can just completely indulge in whatever creative fancy crosses my mind. But, that's probably just a pipe dream :)




What if I Don't Reach My Goal? Oh, the trip is still happening. I'm still going to do a roadtrip. I'm still going to make a book. I may have to scale things accordingly. The book might be a little lighter on content. I may only be able to stop in a few places, and stay closer to home. I may have to do multiple pages for each murder to flesh things out. But, come hell or high water, SOMETHING is going to happen. It's up to you and your contribution to decide exactly how epic that something is going to be.
Why Travel? Why not just Take These Pics Locally?
Foremost, art needs to be inspired, my friend. I'll be a man on a mission. It's a book about a journey... so I'm going to take a journey. I will use firsthand accounts of things that happen to me along the way to add flavor to the book. I'll take advantage of scenery that can't be found in the Inland Northwest where I live. I'm going to attempt to stage some murders in front of some recognizable areas... though we'll just have to see what I can get away with before the Park Ranger catches me ;)
Other Ways You Can Help
 First and foremost: Spread the word. Share the shit out of this campaign. The more visibility I get, the more funding I'll get to help me make this dream a reality.If you've got a place for me to crash along the way, let me know. Couch space... anything. I have a number of friends all over the country who will be willing to put me up for the night. But having more options is never a bad thing. I can't say at this point exactly where the road will lead me. But, if I'm near you, I'd love to meet up. We can go out and grab a couple beers while I'm there. I love meeting new people and absorbing local flavor. As it gets closer to the time for the trip, I'll have a better idea of the exact route I'll be taking and can let people know when to expect me.Are you a model? Would you like to be featured in a page of the book? I'm always looking for new models to stage scenes for the book. Let me know if you would like to be involved in a photoshoot. I can get a bit risque'. Many of my photoshoots involve a bit of nudity, if you're comfortable with that. But showing a little skin is entirely optional. I'll stay within your boundaries. Though, you should expect to be covered in a fair bit of fake blood.If you can aid me along the road, please do feel free to reach out to me. My email is johnjdick@yahoo.com or you can find me on facebook. Or, just contact me if you have any general questions about the campaign that I haven't answered here.

<p>Wildlife and exploration has always been my passion.  For over 25 years I have been giving presentations at over 3,000 schools, universities, and museums.  My experience with wildlife and exploration has awarded me with being one of the youngest people ever inducted into the world renowned Explorers Club, and I am the main character, co-creator, and a producer on the Travel Channel's TV series <br/>HOTEL AMAZON.  To review my full resume please visit my website</p>

<p>I am seeking wonderful people to help fund my first book/video in a series<em>  I </em>entitled  ADD Adventures.  Each book will give inspiration and confidence to children and adults struggling with ADD and show how ADD is not a disability, it is a gift. And the different paths that can be taken by people to use their ADD as the asset can give them a wonderful rewarding life most of the ""normal"" world envies. </p>
<p>This first book/video will be entitled: ADD Adventures: My Amazon.  The book will be about my 15 years of amazing, exciting, and tragic adventures while being immersed in the Amazon rainforest and its culture. NOTE: Extra funds raised will used to deliver Malaria nets to families in the jungle. 4,000 children a day still die of Malaria.  Malaria nets save lives!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Challenge!!!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Is that most of the adventures and
information are in my head, but due to my ADD I can only get it out
in words when I am in complete solitude for long periods of time.  My
life in New York is so full of distractions from morning to night
that it is impossible for me to find the proper writing environment.
And when I am guiding in the Amazon 100% of my attention must be paid
to caring and catering to my guests.</p>

</p>
<p>Your funding will allow me
to put myself in the most productive environment to write this book
as efficiently as possible.  In a hut in the middle Amazon.  No
phones, no internet, just me, and laptop living off the land.  This
environment and the wildness around me clears my mind to where the words splash on the pages
like a waterfall. The Amazon is a harsh environment but that is what
puts my mind in the “now” and inspires me.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Due to my chronic ADD the slightest
distraction of the modern world draws my mind blank and it becomes
madding to try and struggle through the writing processes.  I <u>need
</u>complete off the grid solitude to make this happen.  While in my
jungle “Exile”  I will shoot video of my life there and the world
around me which will be available for download.  I will also include
much of my past 15 years worth of video I filmed in the Amazon.</p>

<div>Hello. My name is Karen West. I am a professional photographer specializing in intimate landscapes. I have been on the road full time for five years creating ""The National Parks Road Trip,"" an intimate landscape portfolio of 70 National Parks, lakeshores, seashores and national park service sites. Susan Ford-West, my partner, has been on the road with me for two years and we have both been members of Sisters on the Fly, the largest outdoor organization for women, now numbering more than 6000. The SOTF have meetups all over the USA, but last year they decided to take a 25 day adventure from Chicago to Santa Monica on Route 66. As soon as we heard about it we knew we wanted to be part of the journey, photograph the experience and chronicle the stories in a coffee table book that would appeal not only to the Sisters, but to anyone who has nostalgia for Route 66 or loves vintage trailers.</div>
<div>This epic journey of over 2400 miles has been a collective journey, but has been the telling of so many individual stories: stories of courage and empowerment, grief and  moving on, sisterhood and camaraderie. Those photos and stories will be celebrated in ""Sisters Get Their Kicks on Route 66.""</div>
<div>This story is important to tell for a variety of reasons. First, the Sisters on the Fly, is an amazing organization of over 6000 women that empowers women to be girls again! We gather together all over the country, many with vintage trailers, some with tents or more modern trailers, to enjoy the outdoors and one another. The rules are ""no men, no kids, no dogs, and be nice.""</div>
<div>Route 66 has such an important place in the American landscape. Many books have been written, mostly by men, about the main attractions along the historic route. But this book will have a very different perspective. It will be written by women, the photography will be from the unique perspective of an intimate landscape photographer and the stories of the 300 women who participated in the journey will be shared in the telling of the story.</div>

<h3><u>Short Summary</u></h3>
<p>It started like many journeys, with the desire to make something. My name is James Grimm, and I wanted to write children's books for my grandchildren. Reluctantly, I learned that I am a lousy artist, and what is a children's book without art? I found out what it would cost to have someone else illustrate a book (USD 1000-4000). While not a backbreaker, my luck, my grandchildren would love books and want more. How can you say no to your grandchildren?</p>
<p>So I spent a year or so wishing the books would illustrate themselves, trying to entice other family members to do it, and realizing my art still stinks. Then I figured maybe other children would like these stories. Yes, I know this is fairly obvious, but self-doubt is really a kicker.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have a friend that believed in me and helped me get moving on this. It helped that his wonderful daughter was also a budding artist  (who is on the team!). They got me excited and thinking we could do this.</p>
<p>Over time, I found other friends that liked the idea and signed on to illustrate, create theme music, or translate. We now have four artists, one musician, ten translators, and me as the author. We all are doing this after our day jobs or school, so things run in stops and starts so far.</p>
<p>I have written each artist's stories around their own groups of characters. We will translate each story into ten languages and each combination of languages to create 55 versions of each story. (like Spanish/English, Korean/French, Chinese/German, Japanese/Portuguese, Thai/Tagalog)</p>
<p>Our goal is to publish three books before the end of March 2021. </p>

<h3><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></h3>
<p>We ask your help to fund the publishing, marketing, and operations for the next few months.  As mentioned above, each story will have 55 versions and 110 different instances (eBook and print on demand). With these three books, we will publish 330 unique book instances. </p>
<p>The stories have been written with most of the translations done and in the early to mid-stages of the artwork.  We have not started the publication work and have a lot of work to do on our website. Your funding will help continue work on book completion, the website set up, and then publishing. </p>
<p>Some of the tools we plan to use for these books have monthly fees based on the number of books published. We have found a publishing aggregator that gives us access to markets across the globe. It just has a monthly cost whether you sell books or not. Also, we have to advertise across markets and languages. If funding is available, we plan to use kids' book online influencers to help promote our books, and usually, there is a fee associated with that. </p>
<p>Whatever support you believe is appropriate, we genuinely appreciate it. We have selected the following types of rewards as a thank you for your belief and support.</p>
<p>For all contributors, we will include you on our<i><strong> <a href=""https://www.yumebk.com/thank-you"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Thank you page</a>,</strong></i> on our website, and sign you up for our newsletter. The Thank You page is a permanent, commemorative page dedicated to those that helped YumeBook Entertainment get its start!</p>
<p>Ebooks - These will be provided in any of the common ebook-reader styles or PDF. We will contact you to determine the style, book, and language(s) you wish to have.</p>
<p>Printed book - We will contact you to determine which book and language(s) you desire.</p>
<p>Signed book - These will be signed by the author. We will contact you to determine which book, and language you desire.</p>
<p>Color Pages PDF (15 images) - This will be a selection of pages from each of these books (maybe 5 each). The pages will be the picture only, with no text or color. We figured a PDF would be best to allow you to print them out as many times as desired. </p>
<p>YumeBook Entertainment's Commerative First Year History - This book will be delivered in Feb 2022, after our fiscal year's closure in Dec 2021. It will include an expose on each book (3-5 pictures, a summary of the story, team credits, and release tidbits) released by YumeBook before the end of Dec 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>We believe producing our stories in multiple languages and bilingual formats from the start benefit the reader. From what we have read/seen, many books translated into other languages are an afterthought. Text may overrun onto pictures because it was not sized for that language or cultural references do not work in the translated works.</p>
<p>Our process includes a cultural/story review from the translator's native perspective. We are not perfect and probably will miss a few things, but we believe we will resolve more issues than we let through. Our goal is to make each book feel like it was made for each reader, no matter where they live or what language they speak. We are trying to get more translators to ensure each language has multiple perspectives from natives of that language.</p>
<p>As I wanted for my grandchildren, we want each child that reads our stories to smile and laugh as they read or are told our stories.</p>
<p>Eventually, we will put forth language learning books with our character groups helping the young reader learn the other languages.  Our future goal is to use Augmented Reality to allow our readers to read, see, and hear these stories.</p>
<p>Another future goal, once we get a physical presence established, is to work with schools or charities to get books to those that might not have the ability to pay for them. We will need to establish storage, printer relations, and distribution methods. Sign up for our newsletter to keep tabs on this and other news from our company.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>One of the main risks of publishing any book is getting lost in the sea of choices. With my first two books, I learned about marketing and sold a few hundred copies between them. </p>
<p>I learned you need to spend money on marketing. Another way is to have many offerings to boost your chances of being discovered and then have follow-on purchases made. With your contributions, we will spend money on marketing. With many versions of our books and different stories, we hope to boost our chances of being discovered.</p>
<p>What are our challenges? If we do not receive enough contributions, we will have to reduce our efforts to live within our budget. Additionally, the rest of our team is working ""best-effort"" and can have periods when they cannot work on their tasks. </p>
<p>These issues will slow us down, not stop us. We will still work on things, but our chances of getting everything out promptly diminish.</p>
<p>Another risk is being able to afford the services that make things more efficient or give us access.  Instead of using our publishing aggregator, we will have to manually publish on each platform. Some platforms no longer allow new contributors. Others do not use English to post, thus requiring us to get our translators to help figure out how to publish. This will limit our reach, at least until we have funds to pay the aggregators.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some folks just can't contribute, no worries, the world is in turmoil, we completely understand. But that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Share on FB, Twitter, Instagram, etc... Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>Sign up for our newsletter, on our website. It will let you know when our books are out - then help share the word!</li>
<li>Check out, like, and subscribe to our<i><strong> <a href=""https://youtu.be/j_fHik0YWbw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube channel</a></strong></i>.  We will add content about each book nearing publication. We are also considering performing readings of the stories.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary
It started like many journeys, with the desire to make something. My name is James Grimm, and I wanted to write children's books for my grandchildren. Reluctantly, I learned that I am a lousy artist, and what is a children's book without art? I found out what it would cost to have someone else illustrate a book (USD 1000-4000). While not a backbreaker, my luck, my grandchildren would love books and want more. How can you say no to your grandchildren?
So I spent a year or so wishing the books would illustrate themselves, trying to entice other family members to do it, and realizing my art still stinks. Then I figured maybe other children would like these stories. Yes, I know this is fairly obvious, but self-doubt is really a kicker.
I was lucky enough to have a friend that believed in me and helped me get moving on this. It helped that his wonderful daughter was also a budding artist  (who is on the team!). They got me excited and thinking we could do this.
Over time, I found other friends that liked the idea and signed on to illustrate, create theme music, or translate. We now have four artists, one musician, ten translators, and me as the author. We all are doing this after our day jobs or school, so things run in stops and starts so far.
I have written each artist's stories around their own groups of characters. We will translate each story into ten languages and each combination of languages to create 55 versions of each story. (like Spanish/English, Korean/French, Chinese/German, Japanese/Portuguese, Thai/Tagalog)
Our goal is to publish three books before the end of March 2021. 
 
A summary and blurb from these first three stories:
Same but Different (working title)
Miss Sofie is a teacher assistant who teaches her students to see how we are all the same, even though we are all different.

(drafting image)
""What is a birthmark?"" Asks Tia.
They all look at Miss Sofie, waiting for her answer.
""A birthmark is a special mark."" Says Miss Sofie.
""Why is it special?"" Asks Mika.
""Well, Tia, do you have a birthmark?"" Miss Sofie asks.
""No."" Says Tia.
""Hmmm, Mika, do you have a birthmark?"" Miss Sofie asks.
""No."" Says Mika.
Miss Sofie nods and brushes the hair from Luca's face.
""You see, not many people have it, so it is special."" She smiles.
--------------------------------------
Making Fun of Others is Bad  (working title)
Meg teaches her younger friends not to tease kids that are using crutches.

(Team image)
""Shin is hurt right now and probably feels bad enough. He will get well and then can play
with everyone,"" says Meg.
""But, he does look funny with those crutches."" Says Chia.
Moku laughs, ""Ya, he makes funny noises when he walks too.""
Meg sighs, ""Be nice. It must hurt him to walk right now.""
""Oh, wow, I didn't know it hurts him."" Says Moku.
""Why doesn't he say so?"" Kai agrees.
Meg smiles, ""Maybe he doesn't want you to treat him differently, so he does not tell everyone.""

Sin anuncios, desde las comunidades, moldeado por periodistas.Nosotras creemos que, hoy más que nunca, los periodistas necesitamos autoridad y control sobre los medios donde laboramos para mejorar la independencia de las noticias. También creemos que los medios deben mantener los estándares más altos de ética, transparencia y responsabilidad. Por eso estamos basando nuestra empresa en las contribuciones de lectores y comunidades. También planeamos certificarnos como Empresa B, lo cual nos haría el primer medio de latinoamérica en lograr estándares rigurosos de impacto positivo social y ambiental.Creando capacidad comunitaria para conectar y comunicar.Los emprendimientos rurales y organizaciones sin fines de lucro que se unan a nuestro directorio se conectarán con lectores nacionales e internacionales, pero no nos detendremos allí. También tendrán acceso al acompañamiento en comunicación, para que puedan expandir su alcance y audiencia. La crisis COVID-19 nos ha demostrado que la capacidad para conectar con el público meta en línea es esencial para que las comunidades puedan reaccionar a crisis y desastres. Parte de nuestra misión es ayudarles a fortalecer esas destrezas. Donaremos este servicio a comunidades de Costa Rica en la primera etapa del proyecto, mientras salimos de la crisis.  Otras formas de ayudar.Si no puede donar, ¡puede ayudarnos a correr la voz y convertir este sueño en una realidad!

<p>Hi! My name is Rebecca. I am now a strong woman of faith and courage with a love of God. I am a survivor. It wasn’t always easy.  As I was given up for adoption when I was a baby, my self-esteem challenges began as a young girl struggling with my identity as a biracial child adopted by a white family. My adopted family loved and nurtured me and I’m thankful that God brought me into their family. I recently discovered my biological families. Learning about my biological parents' background revealed the love and grace of God in placing me with my adoptive family.</p>
<p>Being adopted has put a heart in me to show women the Father’s heart and love for them. I’ve helped women throughout the years overcome rejection, fear, and betrayal with a goal to start a new life in Christ. My passion for helping women to turn the lemons in life to lemonade led to the creation of the Rebekah Project 3:19. My book, “Living Your Life and Loving Those In It,” is my story of God walking with me and teaching me how to turn the bitter parts of life into a sweet season of growth with Him. This book is part one of my story with a workbook to help readers practically apply the principles I share in my book.</p>
<p>I believe this book will help thousands of other women just like me who struggled with self-esteem, depression, and divorce. The decision to divorce a man whom I loved led to being a single mom of four children, navigating relationships, and having to forgive myself of decisions that can not be changed. More than half of the marriages end up in the heartache of divorce. My heart is to help restore women broken by divorce and dysfunctional decisions and show them the wonderful future they have in the kingdom of God. </p>
<p>In addition, to teaching middle school, I write and speak. I have a Bachelors’ of Science in Education and a Masters in Educational Leadership. I’m a member of Immanuel New Life Bible Church in Martinsburg, WV where Rev. Dr. A. L. Lambert, Jr. is my Pastor. In my “free time,” I enjoy exercise, the beach, and spending time with family. </p>
<p><strong>What You Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I’m asking you to invest in reaching women by funding my book. I need to raise $4,000 for the design, printing, and marketing of my book. Every dollar raised will go towards professional design, editing, and printing of my book with 1Voice Global. I already have a contract signed but need to raise the funds to finish the project. If I raise more than $4,000, the funds will go towards the printing of more books.</p> <p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><i> “Living Your Life and Loving Those In It”</i> will help women around the country become restored to go forward in the kingdom of God. A woman discovering her identity and value in Christ alone impacts everyone around her. Her relationships and family benefit from her forgiveness leading to freedom. This book will transform women and their families.</p> <p><strong>Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Most people hate sales. Unfortunately for most people, almost every job, interaction with people, and relationship has elements of sales in it.</p>
<p>From entrepreneurs to non-profit to accountants to... well, you name it, there is an aspect of sales in every single job we do!</p>
<p>This workbook is designed to be a self-guided tour of yourself and find your inner salesperson... even if you HATE the idea! </p>
<p>Level Up! Is a company started by sales and management coach Stuart Rice who wanted to combine all of his 25 years of sales experience into a fun, easy, and effective method to help people who hate sales to learn to love the opportunity. </p>
<p>The book is designed to help you uncover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you are and what you stand for (Mission/Vision/Values).</li>
<li>How to listen to customers so they will talk and talk so customers will listen.</li>
<li>Master how a sale works and understand exactly where you are with every interaction.</li>
<li>How to easily perform a SWOT analysis.</li>
<li>Learn to LOVE sales and LOVE working with people!</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuart Rice has worked for the top companies in their respective industries and has had success in growing businesses up to 500% from $50M to $250M.</p>
<p>Now, Stuart wants to help you get your business to its next level.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Publishing is expensive if done right and it is really important to get the book in front of people so that people can give feedback, offer suggestions, and start benefiting immediately. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, the hope is to raise $10,000 to get the book published correctly and help fund the last couple of months of writing and editing that needs to happen.</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You have an option to get the digital copy for a low cost, get an updated digital copy, get the physical copy, get a limited edition physical copy, and even get coaching from Stuart himself.</span></li>
<li>Regardless of whether or not this project gets funded, it will still become a book. If I hit the goal, the book will come out at a reduced price for the masses.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is really going to allow me to focus on and finish the book and the web series.</p>
<p>Professional sales training for retail and even B2B sales has really gone away. When you go into a store or are approached by salespeople, the training they receive is often on-the-job and usually conducted by a peer... which means that bad habits and behaviors are often shared and allowed. </p>
<p>Let's bring good customer service and proper selling habits to the masses!</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing in the book now saves you a large amount of money on the product and services.</li>
<li>You will be helping create a movement of top-notch sales skills for everyone.</li>
<li>Next time you go to the store, you might find yourself in a ""Wow!"" situation!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am not going to try to manipulate you here. That's what I am trying to avoid altogether.</p>
<p>Instead, the only risk is that I will have to get a part-time job and might delay the book and web series.</p>

<h2>Hey gorgeous,</h2>
<h3>and thanks for checking out my page.</h3>
<p>My name is Sinnead Ali and I am a yoga teacher and the author of Moody Nails: The Mudra Guidebook. This book has been created to enhance and inform your meditation practice.</p>
<p>I have always been passionate about wellness for women and have made it my mission to create tools to help them maintain a better quality of mental and emotional health.</p>
<p>I have focused this book on millennials because according to the World Health Organisation <i>half of all mental illnesses begin by the age of 14 and three-quarters by mid-20s.</i> I have seen so many friends ""burn out"", deal with mental health issues or depend on substances to cope with everyday stress or life-long trauma. Meditation promotes mindfulness and can help us to relax and reset unhealthy emotional habits.</p>
<p>Thanks to meditation I've experienced significant shifts in my life and I want to share the knowledge and beauty of mudra with others.</p>
<p>My mum used to tell me <i>""your nails are your jewels, not your tools"" </i> and as a yoga teacher who also loves a good pamper, I think that they can be both!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535091153/ftc6i3dgkh56hratuqn2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><b>What's in the book?</b></h3>
<p>The book details the <i>benefits</i> and <i>how-to</i> of twenty-five mudras that have been photographed in the very Insta-worthy area of Haji Lane in Singapore. All mudras feature nail art by The Nail Social with a breakdown of how to recreate the designs yourself.</p>
<p>Moody Nails also features twenty-five affirmations and several guided meditations. </p>
<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A5, full colour 90+ page book </li>
<li>Hard cover with TWO cover colour options; mustard/peach</li>
<li>25 stunningly photographed hand mudras featuring nail art by The Nail Social</li>
<li>6 pages for journaling.</li>

<h3><strong>The Partners</strong></h3>
<p>The nail art was designed by The Nail Social - a social enterprise based in the popular Haji Lane in Singapore. The Nail Social employ marginalized women in the area, giving them new skills and fair income. </p>
<p>Some of the mudras feature jewellery from brands I love in Singapore who all happen to be female-founded. Their brand missions all resonate with Moody Nails be it loving Mother Earth or creating employment for women.</p>
<p>The foreword of the book has been written by <a href=""http://themeditationteacher.net/new-moon-lodge/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dani Van de Velde</a> and it features guided meditations by yoga and meditation teachers throughout.</p>

<h3>Backers</h3>
<p>By backing this project you will help to fund the design and printing cost of Moody Nails. With many pledge options available, you can choose the pledge that best suits you and you will receive your reward within one month of the campaign ending- just in time to help create your New Years resolutions with intent.</p>
<p>I believe that we all have the innate ability to heal and manifest - the power is literally in our hands! So become apart of the Moody Nails community by supporting this campaign!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>By fully funding this project we will go into phase two of completing the book design</li>
<li>Then, its off to print and shipping straight to your door!</li>
<li>I have partnered with some fab brands to spruce up the perks- the more you pledge, the more you get back! <i>Check out the pledge tiers for more info.</i>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mental health awareness should not be a flash in the pan trend. Let's keep up the conversations and shows the next generation that self-care for mental and emotional health should be as regular as brushing your teeth!</li>
<li>Together we can grow a community of women and girls who are passionate about meditation.</li>
<li>Future partnerships - <i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>depending on the book's success</i><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> I would look to support advocacy groups and charities working with women and girls in SE Asia.</span>

Thanks to meditation I've experienced significant shifts in my life and I want to share the knowledge and beauty of mudra with others.
My mum used to tell me ""your nails are your jewels, not your tools""  and as a yoga teacher who also loves a good pamper, I think that they can be both!

What's in the book?
The book details the benefits and how-to of twenty-five mudras that have been photographed in the very Insta-worthy area of Haji Lane in Singapore. All mudras feature nail art by The Nail Social with a breakdown of how to recreate the designs yourself.
Moody Nails also features twenty-five affirmations and several guided meditations. 
Details

A5, full colour 90+ page book 
Hard cover with TWO cover colour options; mustard/peach
25 stunningly photographed hand mudras featuring nail art by The Nail Social
6 pages for journaling.

Content


 



The Partners
The nail art was designed by The Nail Social - a social enterprise based in the popular Haji Lane in Singapore. The Nail Social employ marginalized women in the area, giving them new skills and fair income. 
Some of the mudras feature jewellery from brands I love in Singapore who all happen to be female-founded. Their brand missions all resonate with Moody Nails be it loving Mother Earth or creating employment for women.
The foreword of the book has been written by Dani Van de Velde and it features guided meditations by yoga and meditation teachers throughout.

Backers
By backing this project you will help to fund the design and printing cost of Moody Nails. With many pledge options available, you can choose the pledge that best suits you and you will receive your reward within one month of the campaign ending- just in time to help create your New Years resolutions with intent.
I believe that we all have the innate ability to heal and manifest - the power is literally in our hands! So become apart of the Moody Nails community by supporting this campaign!
 


What We Need & What You Get

By fully funding this project we will go into phase two of completing the book design
Then, its off to print and shipping straight to your door!
I have partnered with some fab brands to spruce up the perks- the more you pledge, the more you get back! Check out the pledge tiers for more info.

If we don't reach the goal? *whomp whomp* if we have enough to fund a certain amount of the printing we will go ahead with a smaller batch so all pledges receive their rewards - if not you get your money back. In the meantime your fee stays safely with Indiegogo.com


The Impact

Mental health awareness should not be a flash in the pan trend. Let's keep up the conversations and shows the next generation that self-care for mental and emotional health should be as regular as brushing your teeth!
Together we can grow a community of women and girls who are passionate about meditation.
Future partnerships - depending on the book's success I would look to support advocacy groups and charities working with women and girls in SE Asia.



Other Ways You Can Help
Can't pledge with cash? No worries, that doesn't mean you can't help.

<p>El libro <strong>Dominicanas Fuera de Serie</strong> presenta las vidas de dominicanas extraordinarias que han participado activamente en la construcción de nuestra nación a través de 500 años de historia en formato de cuentos infantiles para lectores de <strong>+7 años</strong>. </p>
<p>Como país en vías de desarrollo <strong>es crucial revisar la narrativa sobre el valor y la relevancia que tiene para toda la sociedad la vida de las dominicanas</strong>. Al rescatar y difundir sus invaluables aportes sociales, culturales, económicos y científicos, especialmente en una región como América Latina, donde ocurren más de la mitad de los feminicidios del mundo, colaboramos con una cultura de paz, igualdad y equidad. </p>
<p>Para contrarrestar esta alarmante realidad, <strong>se hace necesario que las jóvenes generaciones y sus familias cuenten con referentes femeninos cercanos y reales, de manera que se modifique gradualmente y desde la infancia la limitada imagen sobre los roles de las niñas y las mujeres del país, de la región y del mundo</strong>.

<p>Al leer sobre las vidas de extraordinarias mujeres criollas reunidas en el libro para niños y niñas “Dominicanas Fuera de Serie: +120 mujeres que transformaron la República Dominicana”, <strong>jóvenes del territorio nacional tendrán acceso a ejemplos de enriquecimiento comunitario</strong> a través de aportes concretos y transformadores realizados por cada una de las protagonistas, permitiendo que estos modelos sirvan como motivación de empoderamiento, fortaleza y cambio social en la República Dominicana. </p>

<h3>This didn't happen to me... but it could have.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm P. J. Galati and this book started as a dream in 2006. I mean a literal dream. I woke up and wanted to make sense of seeing giant whale-sized, killer catfish attacking a beach. So I started writing, not knowing that ten years later I would have a novel of over 119,000 words! I spent the next two years revising it, asking for opinions, drawing all the chapter artwork and maps, hiring a cover artist, then finally getting a copy printed. Now it's time to move this forward. Below is a little taste of the novel.</p>
<p>John Archer is just an average…well, maybe <i>below average</i> pizza delivery guy, who has nothing happening in his home life, love life or anywhere else. That is, until he accidentally gets trapped in La La Land, the daydream world. Greeted by Cynthia, an extremely sexy local, John enjoys the luxury and safety of La La Land City at first. It’s not until they venture outside of it’s walls for a day at the beach, that John starts down a dangerous path, complete with a cursed forest, a village of cannibalistic pygmies, vicious mythical creatures, elusive powerful magic and all in a place with no weapons to defend himself, not even a dinner fork. Cynthia knows more than she’s letting on, and John eventually picks up on it. Despite being thrown from one crisis to the next, she sticks by John’s side as she’s been in love with him for hundreds of years even though he has no memory of her, or his own deeply hidden past. A darker truth creeps up on John as puzzle pieces fall into place and he figures out that the microverse of La La Land is not only real, but about to be destroyed…on purpose. With the help of a tree elf, a fire demon and God's cousin, John and Cynthia set out to save their entire universe from literally unraveling. </p>
<p>If you like the Harry Potter series, The Magicians, Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz, then you will love The Legend of La La Land . The one thing they all have in common is taking an average unsuspecting hero and dropping them into a magical world where they have to quickly adapt to survive. This is what happens to John, he accidentally gets trapped in La La Land and while it seems like a wonderful fantasy at first, he's quickly introduced to the harsh reality that nearly everything there wants to kill him, and an even larger threat looms over the entire land. <br/><br/>I had a few test readers and all of them agreed that this is an unpredictable story. You will never know what's coming next, but it will keep pulling you forward, deeper into this new, bizarre and oddly familiar world. This fantasy adventure is full of comedy, action and even a little romance.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong><i>The Legend of La La Land</i></strong>  is my first completed novel and I'm working on getting this book out to the world. This fundraiser is not to sell the book, it's to raise funds for a book coach, who will help me get a top literary agent (very hard to do) and then the two of them will help me sign a good contract, with a publishing company (harder than finding the agent!). Should I go over my goal, the additional funds will be used for travel related to the book, like book signings and so on. If there's A LOT more, then it will go towards helping me write the second novel in the series, <strong><i>The Return to La La Land</i></strong>. I presently have five books planned in the series, but it could easily double or triple, based on how well it's received.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what I'm offering:</strong></p>

I'm P. J. Galati and this book started as a dream in 2006. I mean a literal dream. I woke up and wanted to make sense of seeing giant whale-sized, killer catfish attacking a beach. So I started writing, not knowing that ten years later I would have a novel of over 119,000 words! I spent the next two years revising it, asking for opinions, drawing all the chapter artwork and maps, hiring a cover artist, then finally getting a copy printed. Now it's time to move this forward. Below is a little taste of the novel.
John Archer is just an average…well, maybe below average pizza delivery guy, who has nothing happening in his home life, love life or anywhere else. That is, until he accidentally gets trapped in La La Land, the daydream world. Greeted by Cynthia, an extremely sexy local, John enjoys the luxury and safety of La La Land City at first. It’s not until they venture outside of it’s walls for a day at the beach, that John starts down a dangerous path, complete with a cursed forest, a village of cannibalistic pygmies, vicious mythical creatures, elusive powerful magic and all in a place with no weapons to defend himself, not even a dinner fork. Cynthia knows more than she’s letting on, and John eventually picks up on it. Despite being thrown from one crisis to the next, she sticks by John’s side as she’s been in love with him for hundreds of years even though he has no memory of her, or his own deeply hidden past. A darker truth creeps up on John as puzzle pieces fall into place and he figures out that the microverse of La La Land is not only real, but about to be destroyed…on purpose. With the help of a tree elf, a fire demon and God's cousin, John and Cynthia set out to save their entire universe from literally unraveling. 
If you like the Harry Potter series, The Magicians, Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz, then you will love The Legend of La La Land . The one thing they all have in common is taking an average unsuspecting hero and dropping them into a magical world where they have to quickly adapt to survive. This is what happens to John, he accidentally gets trapped in La La Land and while it seems like a wonderful fantasy at first, he's quickly introduced to the harsh reality that nearly everything there wants to kill him, and an even larger threat looms over the entire land. I had a few test readers and all of them agreed that this is an unpredictable story. You will never know what's coming next, but it will keep pulling you forward, deeper into this new, bizarre and oddly familiar world. This fantasy adventure is full of comedy, action and even a little romance. 

What We Need & What You Get
The Legend of La La Land  is my first completed novel and I'm working on getting this book out to the world. This fundraiser is not to sell the book, it's to raise funds for a book coach, who will help me get a top literary agent (very hard to do) and then the two of them will help me sign a good contract, with a publishing company (harder than finding the agent!). Should I go over my goal, the additional funds will be used for travel related to the book, like book signings and so on. If there's A LOT more, then it will go towards helping me write the second novel in the series, The Return to La La Land. I presently have five books planned in the series, but it could easily double or triple, based on how well it's received.
Here's what I'm offering:
At the lowest level of support $10 I am offering a premium full color double sided bookmark. This is 24 point, tripled layered, velvet finished and it feels great on the fingers.
​

For $20 you can pick from select chapter artwork, including the map (all hand drawn by me) in the book and I will have prints made on 9"" X 13"" papyrus (for that cool old look) laser engraved (burned in), mounted on charcoal art paper, hand signed and numbered by me.


At $25 you get The Legend of La La Land E-book
At $35 you get the Audio Book read by the Author P. J. Galati
At $40 you get a print of the book
At $45 you get a signed print of the book



At $50 you get a signed print of the book, plus the E-Book 
At $60 you get a signed print of the book, plus the E-Book, plus the audio book read by me
At $75  you get a signed print of the book, plus the E-Book, plus the audio book read by me and a single papyrus print
At $100  you get a signed print of the book, plus the E-Book, plus the audio book read by me, two papyrus prints and the book mark
Sterling Glowplug Level at $200 you get everything at the $100 level, plus a Video chat with me for an hour 
Zaggers Level at $500 You get everything at the $200 level (including 5 papyrus prints) and I will name a character in the second novel after you or you can pick a name.
Threat Basher Level at $1,000 Everything from the Zaggers Level, but the video chat is replaced with us going to dinner and you can pick my brain all night about the novel, characters and upcoming secrets!

My goal is to fulfill all the pledges and items (books, bookmarks, E-book, audio book, etc) by December 2019. This is my first time dealing with the publishing world, so this is just a rough estimate. I will continue to post updates as I get them, so you as my supporter, will be well informed. Thank you so much,                             P. J. GalatiBreak it down for folks in more detail:

The Aftermath
The successful funding of this novel will begin a cascade of events:

It's my goal to write a series of La La Land novels.
As a filmmaker, I'm also on a 5 year plan to take this story to Hollywood and get it made.
I plan to expand this process beyond the novel into other media, like a La La Land Video Game.


Risky Business
This entire process is a tricky venture, navigating the ever changing publishing industry nothing is set in stone.

This is why I'm choosing to surround myself with experienced people who can guide me to make smart decisions through out the process.
I want you to know that even if I can't make everything happen as planned, I will still get everything promised to you supporters, even if I have to self publish the books myself.

</div><p><b>Hello,
there.</b> I am Jeff Strawman, webmaster and editor of Achilles
Last Stand, a Led Zeppelin fansite (<a href=""http://www.led-zeppelin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.led-zeppelin.org</a>).
Since launching the website in 1996, I have reached Led Zeppelin fans in 214 countries,
and made many, many friends along the way.</p>
<p>My top goal with Achilles
Last Stand is to create the best Led Zeppelin-related website online. I have
spent many hours to make it what it is today. One of the sections in the
website details what gear the members of Led Zeppelin have used throughout
their careers. <b><i>Led Zeppelin Gear</i></b> is the next step.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>I want to take <i>Led
Zeppelin Gear</i> to print!</b></p>
<p>Although <b><i>Led Zeppelin Gear</i></b> was started as an
online resource, and I will continue to update the website, I have always
dreamt of making a physical book. And now I am doing it! <b><i>Led Zeppelin Gear</i></b> will be
a beautiful way to preserve some of the content I have featured online and
allow it to be enjoyed virtually anywhere.</p>
<p>The book will be a gorgeous piece around 600 pages. It
will feature noteworthy information on a lot the instrumentation,
amplification, effects and accessories that were used, as described in
interview by Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, John Bonham and Robert Plant, as well
as some of the people that were there, such as Roger Mayer, Andy Johns, Bruce
Becvar, Jeff Ocheltree and Andy Manson.</p>
<p><b>Why this book?</b></p>
<p>There are many Led Zeppelin-related books currently
available. Some feature biographies on the band members, some feature the live
experience, and are a catch-all, encyclopedia-style, however there is not a
book available about the gear that Led Zeppelin used.</p>
<p>There are gear books available for other bands, such as
The Rolling Stones, Greatful Dead and The Beatles, however there is not a book
available about the gear that Led Zeppelin used.</p>
<p><b>Who am I to write it?</b></p>
<p>Who am I am why should you consider funding and/or
reading this book? I am not a former member of Led Zeppelin’s road crew, I
wasn’t there while Led Zeppelin was an active band. I don’t work for Gibson or
Fender or Marshall. In short, I am not an expert. I am just a thirty-something
guy with a deep interest in Led Zeppelin and a penchant for perfection. I
started researching for this book sixteen years ago.</p>
<p>In addition to being a Led Zeppelin fan, I am also a
musician. I grew up in a musical house. All of my immediate family are
musically inclined. After starting with piano as a young child and playing the
baritone and tuba, beginning in elementary, I began playing the bass guitar in
the summer after senior year of high school. I’ve played in bands for the last
twenty-one years and have really made it a point to pay attention to the detail
of gear that the various bandmates have used.</p>
<p>Obviously, with being in bands, I am a great lover of
music. Although I listen to most genres of music, classic rock of the 1960s and
1970s is my favorite. Led Zeppelin was introduced to me by high school friend,
who spun his mom’s Zeppelin vinyl after school.</p>
<p>I grew up in the generation with a computer in every
classroom and have been involved with technology my entire adult life. I
remember in 1994, while in college, I remember learning about this relatively
new thing called <i>HyperText Markup
Language</i> that interpret text and images on to the World Wide Web. I recall
a handful of Led Zeppelin websites that popped up of the next few years and
they often presented different information on the same topics. I figured that I
needed to create a website about Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>I found a web hosting company that offered unlimited
space and bandwidth and after a few years of presenting my Led Zeppelin website
as a sub-domain on my personal website (<a href=""http://www.fancyketchupguy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fancyketchupguy.com</a> –
<i>now defunct – </i><b>don’t ask!</b>), I purchased <a href=""http://www.led-zeppelin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.led-zeppelin.org</a>
and presented my website there. My website had A LOT of information, as I
scoured the internet for every bit and piece of related content. In addition,
I’ve picked the brains of a lot of people, including members of the Led
Zeppelin, CEOs from gear manufacturers and people who are just plain
intelligent. With a fine-tooth comb. I’ve spent countless hours at many
libraries searching through books, magazines and newspapers. I want to have the
best Led Zeppelin-related website online.</p>
<p><b>What to expect of <i>Led
Zeppelin Gear?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Led
Zeppelin Gear</i></b> consists of seven chapters that gives a
whole look into a lot of information. The book is written chronologically,
beginning with the first time each piece of gear was used for each member.</p>
<p>Chapter One, <b>Jimmy
Page: The Grand Sorcerer</b>, which comes from a description from Keith Relf,
prior to performing <i>Shapes Of Things</i>
at the Anderson Theatre, in New York City, New York, on March 30, 1968. From
playing <i>Baby, Let’s Play House</i> on a
found Spanish guitar to the Martin D-28 Marquis acoustic guitar that was used
by Page on his last live performance, on November 5, 2011, the reader will
learn about Page use of selected pieces of signature gear to create the sound
he wanted.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, <b>John
Paul Jones: The Groove</b>, lets the reader learn that Jones is much, much more
than just a bass guitarist. He is a multi-instrumentalist that is not afraid to
pick up any instrument or have any instrumented crafted to get the music out of
his head and projected out through his fingers. Jones had never stopped
evolving and transforming sound and was never stuck or felt comfortable in just
one genre.</p>
<p>Chapter Three, <b>John
Bonham: The Thunder</b>, chronicles a kid from the Black Country that went from
rags to riches in his eighteen-year professional musical career. The world will
never see another drummer with Bonham’s hard-hitting, technical expertise,
being able to stay slightly behind the beat, showmanship and good looks.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, <b>Robert
Plant: The Lion</b>, addresses that skinny, blond, head-strong Adonis who
wanted to make it on his terms. He hasn’t been linked to only just one genre of
music, while still appearing current.</p>
<p>Chapter Five, <b>Three
Hours of Lunacy</b>, discusses the PA (public address) systems that were used
at live Led Zeppelin concerts, from the earliest days up to their last
performance in 2007.</p>
<p>Chapter Six, <b>Magic
Studio Days</b>, is a song-by-song analysis of the gear that was used in the
studio, both by the members of Led Zeppelin, as well by the engineers. Also included
is a study of the tracks in each song, as well as some history on the songs.</p>
<p><b>What is so special about this book?</b></p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>First of all – me. Nineteen years of
research by a 30-something Led Zeppelin fanatic has resulted in a very thorough
written experience.</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span><i><b>Led
Zeppelin Gear</b></i> is a jam-packed book. All 600+ pages
(~120,000 words) are full of well-known and some not-so-well-known information.</p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>The approach. I am not here for a quick
buck. This is my honest and truthful tribute to Led Zeppelin. I have gone to
great lengths to make this book as grand as it could be.</p>
<p><b>Your support means the world to me.</b></p>
<p>I am thrilled about the prospect of seeing <i><b>Led Zeppelin Gear</b></i> in print, and I hope
you are, too. There are a variety of costs associated with a project of this
size, and you support will allow me to:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Set aside time to focus on finishing
writing the book</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Copy editing content</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Secure print rights for photographs</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Secure ISBNs (International Standard Book
Numbers) for printed and electronic versions</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Pay for the printing costs up front</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all pledges are subject to
Indegogo and/or PayPal <b>fees</b>
which amount to about 10-12% of the total funds.</p>
<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p><i><b>Led
Zeppelin Gear</b></i> is being released in three different
offerings: the eBook, the hard cover book and the leather bound book.</p>
<p>The eBook will be in your choice of format (EPUB, MOBI,
AZW3, PDF, etc.) for compatibility on your eReader.</p>
<p>The hard cover book will be printed on 60 lb 420PPI
(pages per inch) 94 opacity paper with a high-gloss cover, created by designer
Gerson Vecchi. The book is in a US trade 6x9 inch size.</p>
<p>The leather bound book will be a hand-bound in black
leather, decorated with a gold stamp on the front.</p>
<p>And, just because, there will be an 11x17 inch, full
gloss commemorative promotional poster available.</p>
<p><b>So, what?  Now,
what?</b></p>
<p>Well, this is the moment when I turn the mic to you...
As you will see in the perks, the contributions that I am shooting for are
<b>pre-sales</b>, rather than charitable
donations (although I am not in the position to turn those down either!).</p>
<p>If you cannot contribute, I would be very grateful if
you could share this campaign.

I grew up in the generation with a computer in every
classroom and have been involved with technology my entire adult life. I
remember in 1994, while in college, I remember learning about this relatively
new thing called HyperText Markup
Language that interpret text and images on to the World Wide Web. I recall
a handful of Led Zeppelin websites that popped up of the next few years and
they often presented different information on the same topics. I figured that I
needed to create a website about Led Zeppelin.
I found a web hosting company that offered unlimited
space and bandwidth and after a few years of presenting my Led Zeppelin website
as a sub-domain on my personal website (www.fancyketchupguy.com –
now defunct – don’t ask!), I purchased www.led-zeppelin.org
and presented my website there. My website had A LOT of information, as I
scoured the internet for every bit and piece of related content. In addition,
I’ve picked the brains of a lot of people, including members of the Led
Zeppelin, CEOs from gear manufacturers and people who are just plain
intelligent. With a fine-tooth comb. I’ve spent countless hours at many
libraries searching through books, magazines and newspapers. I want to have the
best Led Zeppelin-related website online.
What to expect of Led
Zeppelin Gear?
Led
Zeppelin Gear consists of seven chapters that gives a
whole look into a lot of information. The book is written chronologically,
beginning with the first time each piece of gear was used for each member.
Chapter One, Jimmy
Page: The Grand Sorcerer, which comes from a description from Keith Relf,
prior to performing Shapes Of Things
at the Anderson Theatre, in New York City, New York, on March 30, 1968. From
playing Baby, Let’s Play House on a
found Spanish guitar to the Martin D-28 Marquis acoustic guitar that was used
by Page on his last live performance, on November 5, 2011, the reader will
learn about Page use of selected pieces of signature gear to create the sound
he wanted.
Chapter Two, John
Paul Jones: The Groove, lets the reader learn that Jones is much, much more
than just a bass guitarist. He is a multi-instrumentalist that is not afraid to
pick up any instrument or have any instrumented crafted to get the music out of
his head and projected out through his fingers. Jones had never stopped
evolving and transforming sound and was never stuck or felt comfortable in just
one genre.
Chapter Three, John
Bonham: The Thunder, chronicles a kid from the Black Country that went from
rags to riches in his eighteen-year professional musical career. The world will
never see another drummer with Bonham’s hard-hitting, technical expertise,
being able to stay slightly behind the beat, showmanship and good looks.
Chapter Four, Robert
Plant: The Lion, addresses that skinny, blond, head-strong Adonis who
wanted to make it on his terms. He hasn’t been linked to only just one genre of
music, while still appearing current.
Chapter Five, Three
Hours of Lunacy, discusses the PA (public address) systems that were used
at live Led Zeppelin concerts, from the earliest days up to their last
performance in 2007.
Chapter Six, Magic
Studio Days, is a song-by-song analysis of the gear that was used in the
studio, both by the members of Led Zeppelin, as well by the engineers. Also included
is a study of the tracks in each song, as well as some history on the songs.
What is so special about this book?
1. 
First of all – me. Nineteen years of
research by a 30-something Led Zeppelin fanatic has resulted in a very thorough
written experience.
2. 
Led
Zeppelin Gear is a jam-packed book. All 600+ pages
(~120,000 words) are full of well-known and some not-so-well-known information.
3. 
The approach. I am not here for a quick
buck. This is my honest and truthful tribute to Led Zeppelin. I have gone to
great lengths to make this book as grand as it could be.
Your support means the world to me.
I am thrilled about the prospect of seeing Led Zeppelin Gear in print, and I hope
you are, too. There are a variety of costs associated with a project of this
size, and you support will allow me to:
· 
Set aside time to focus on finishing
writing the book
· 
Copy editing content
· 
Secure print rights for photographs
· 
Secure ISBNs (International Standard Book
Numbers) for printed and electronic versions
· 
Pay for the printing costs up front
Keep in mind that all pledges are subject to
Indegogo and/or PayPal fees
which amount to about 10-12% of the total funds.
The Perks
Led
Zeppelin Gear is being released in three different
offerings: the eBook, the hard cover book and the leather bound book.
The eBook will be in your choice of format (EPUB, MOBI,
AZW3, PDF, etc.) for compatibility on your eReader.
The hard cover book will be printed on 60 lb 420PPI
(pages per inch) 94 opacity paper with a high-gloss cover, created by designer
Gerson Vecchi. The book is in a US trade 6x9 inch size.
The leather bound book will be a hand-bound in black
leather, decorated with a gold stamp on the front.
And, just because, there will be an 11x17 inch, full
gloss commemorative promotional poster available.
So, what?  Now,
what?
Well, this is the moment when I turn the mic to you...
As you will see in the perks, the contributions that I am shooting for are
pre-sales, rather than charitable
donations (although I am not in the position to turn those down either!).
If you cannot contribute, I would be very grateful if
you could share this campaign. Please join the Facebook page or follow Led Zeppelin Gear on Twitter. By doing this, I can keep you in the loop about this
book, and my next project (yes, something is cooking already!).

Highways, truck stops and people I meet on the road.  You'll discover them in a collection of stories in a book I call<b> ""How To Not Get Beat-Up In A Small-Town Bar""</b> and other stories of the road. The writing is done but the publishing part is just beginning. And you can help us.<br/></p>

Someone once said that everybody has one thing that they remember more than anything else in their life. It didn't take me long to realize that ""one thing,"" Besides my family and friends it was a passion for driving across America and Canada any chance I get. On over a half million miles I always look for old highways, truck stops and cafes where I meet the strangers who give me moments of their lives. <br/><br/>This book is a collection of travel stories and I've posted 2 excerpts starting with the first one below. Besides them go to <b>Galley</b> where you can see more videos from my career and <b>Perks</b>, which are photographs and illustrations you can own, <br/><br/><b>From ""Not Being John Malkovich"" - Paris<br/><i>""We began to walk towards the barber shop when a very large French-African man stopped us with a raised hand, which lowered until he was pointing at us. Then he looked straight at me and said those words. ""John Malkovich.""</i> <i>It wasn't the first time I was mistaken for the actor. I quietly said I wasn't. But he wasn't buying it. ""You are John Malkovich"". And with that he introduced himself as Etienne and took me by the arm and led me into the barber shop where several Africans stopped and looked at my brother and I. Etienne began to introduce me to the group while my brother couldn't believe it. Most of them smiled but one in particular was suspicious. Since they mostly spoke French and English I asked Etienne why this group argued all the time, as my brother and I had seen them do for the past few evenings. He smiled and said ""Sports and politics."" </i><br/></b><br/>I have a big wall map with highlighted highways and pins that identify every town and motel I've been to. It's from this that I remember a young highway flagger in Yellowstone talking about her life and the cowboy who appeared with cans of Bud to while away until the road was open. Or sitting with a Hollywood star in the Rocky Mountains or searching for aliens with my brother Dave in Roswell, NM. I realized that they were strong in my memory, as bright and sharp as if they were right beside me now. And it was time to tell their stories.<br/><br/>Stay with us. <br/><p><br/></p>

<br/><h3>What we need are Donations &amp; you get Perks<br/>
</h3>First of all, the hardest part was to write the book which took about six months. So I'm not asking for funding for that. It's been written. What I need is to get funding in order to pay three people who will finish the job as well as shipping and other payments listed below.  For donations, we're offering <b>Perks,</b> my pro photographs and illustrations drawn by <a href=""http://adrianaguidi.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adriana Guidi</a> .<br/><br/>What you get is the satisfaction to help us out and getting some great photographs and illustrations for yourself. Since we don't have a publisher with pockets of money we have to look at crowdfunding to help us finish the project. We have strict rules to obey and indiegogo.com holds the donations until they complete an audit within 15 days.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455124728/eytugqwpwqgwfc45hl5y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>So how much do we need?<br/><br/><p>I'm asking you for $2500 and here's where it's going:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Payment to Adriana Guidi, the illustrator. <br/>
</li>
<li>Payment to the formatting specialist whose rate is lower than Amazon's rates.</li>
<li>Payment to the book cover designer including color images on front and back.</li>
<li>Payment to Indigogo platform fee at 5%.<br/>
</li>
<li>3rd party fees; 3% plus 30 cents per transaction for credit card and 3-5% for paypal.</li>
<li>Mailing costs to send perks to all of you donators. Wait till you see our extras.</li>
<li>Advertising will be used to promote the book sending copies to newspapers and anywhere else we can advertise.<br/>
</li>
<li>Funds are held until we reach our goal at which point, depending on whether we are funded completely or not, we can decide to use the amount we get.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I get nothing. That is until the books are being sold around the end of March. <br/></p>

<br/>I love this sign. Speed limit in Montana. The book I wrote is far away from Hollywood except for two stories; <i>The Movie Star and Pablo. </i>along with <i>Being John Malkovich</i> story.  My small-town roots keep me going meeting people like a man who painted a mountain and in a desert and discovering the infamous ""Jackalope"" in Douglas Wyoming. And by the time you get through this you'll know them too. <br/><br/>

<h3>What's the risk?</h3>What about risk we're taking? Besides having written twelve produced movies and rewritten ten more produced movies and five TV series. I also have written two books; one is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466449772/ref=cm_sw_su_dp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emperor of Mars</a> which is a story about a twelve year old boy based on my early life in a small town. The other book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Working-Writers-Screenplay-Makichuk/dp/1482375109"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Working Writer's Screenplay</a>
 is based on my teaching screenwriting at University of California L.A. (UCLA) one of the top universities in the world. Both books will be ""Perks"" for 
this project.<br/><br/>You can also find out my film credits on  <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0538601/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Movie credits</a> and <a href=""http://myfilmproject09.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My Film Blog</a> which started in 2009 and continues to offer stories about the movie business, good and bad. I'm also on Facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jim.makichuk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jim.makichuk</a> and on youtube at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2jbaoebCtfTHuBiPD4N3TA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jamakichuk. </a><br/><br/>So what will we risk, all of us? One of the biggest risks is done, the book is written unlike other crowdfunders. And you can be assured that the writing works, after all it's what I've done since grade school. And I've got team players to help. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<p>So what happens when it all ends? Well, depending on the funding, it will be audited after 30 days by indiegogo.com and at the appropriate time will release the funding for the final work and sending the perks to everyone who donated money for them. <br/></p>
<p>Here's another quick preview of another story.<br/></p>
<p><i><b>From ""A UFO Skeptic at the Holy Grail - New Mexico</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>""It's two in the morning, I awake to the sound of something incredibly powerful outside, seemingly hovering over the motel room I'm in. If this was L.A., I'd think it was just a police helicopter chasing down a carjacker. But this particular motel is in Roswell, New Mexico. It's where an alleged alien flying saucer crashed in 1947 and spawned a conspiracy debate that has become the foundation of the UFO industry as well as a cottage industry as well. I glance over at my brother's bed. Dave's sound asleep. He's why we're here, having convinced me into taking him to this part of the country by promising that we can visit Santa Fe. He's the family member who's into UFO's, MIB's, MUFON and other abbreviations I never knew existed. Outside, the sound is deep and trembling, I'm not dreaming, I check my wristwatch and look towards the window for those bright lights that streak into the room when aliens arrive."" </b></i><br/></p>
Other stories deal with a secret military base, a woman who breaks the rules, 700 miles across the Canadian winter, a mysterious record album, a place called Rome, the inventor of the television screen and more, And of course a small-town bar. All stories are real and happened to me alone or with my brother Dave.<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455125691/aocoxrt8tyw7xj3wlkif.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

On over a half million miles I always look for old highways, truck stops and cafes where I meet the strangers who give me moments of their lives. This book is a collection of travel stories and I've posted 2 excerpts starting with the first one below. Besides them go to Galley where you can see more videos from my career and Perks, which are photographs and illustrations you can own, From ""Not Being John Malkovich"" - Paris""We began to walk towards the barber shop when a very large French-African man stopped us with a raised hand, which lowered until he was pointing at us. Then he looked straight at me and said those words. ""John Malkovich."" It wasn't the first time I was mistaken for the actor. I quietly said I wasn't. But he wasn't buying it. ""You are John Malkovich"". And with that he introduced himself as Etienne and took me by the arm and led me into the barber shop where several Africans stopped and looked at my brother and I. Etienne began to introduce me to the group while my brother couldn't believe it. Most of them smiled but one in particular was suspicious. Since they mostly spoke French and English I asked Etienne why this group argued all the time, as my brother and I had seen them do for the past few evenings. He smiled and said ""Sports and politics."" I have a big wall map with highlighted highways and pins that identify every town and motel I've been to. It's from this that I remember a young highway flagger in Yellowstone talking about her life and the cowboy who appeared with cans of Bud to while away until the road was open. Or sitting with a Hollywood star in the Rocky Mountains or searching for aliens with my brother Dave in Roswell, NM. I realized that they were strong in my memory, as bright and sharp as if they were right beside me now. And it was time to tell their stories.Stay with us. 



What we need are Donations & you get Perks
First of all, the hardest part was to write the book which took about six months. So I'm not asking for funding for that. It's been written. What I need is to get funding in order to pay three people who will finish the job as well as shipping and other payments listed below.  For donations, we're offering Perks, my pro photographs and illustrations drawn by Adriana Guidi .What you get is the satisfaction to help us out and getting some great photographs and illustrations for yourself. Since we don't have a publisher with pockets of money we have to look at crowdfunding to help us finish the project. We have strict rules to obey and indiegogo.com holds the donations until they complete an audit within 15 days.
So how much do we need?I'm asking you for $2500 and here's where it's going:

Payment to Adriana Guidi, the illustrator. 

Payment to the formatting specialist whose rate is lower than Amazon's rates.
Payment to the book cover designer including color images on front and back.
Payment to Indigogo platform fee at 5%.

3rd party fees; 3% plus 30 cents per transaction for credit card and 3-5% for paypal.
Mailing costs to send perks to all of you donators. Wait till you see our extras.
Advertising will be used to promote the book sending copies to newspapers and anywhere else we can advertise.

Funds are held until we reach our goal at which point, depending on whether we are funded completely or not, we can decide to use the amount we get.

And I get nothing. That is until the books are being sold around the end of March. 


NOTE for Canada book shipping: Costs to send to Canada is higher.




Above is a Perk illustration by Adriana that tells one of the stories in the collection about a famous hotel and a cat. See more perks in Gallery.

I love this sign. Speed limit in Montana. The book I wrote is far away from Hollywood except for two stories; The Movie Star and Pablo. along with Being John Malkovich story.  My small-town roots keep me going meeting people like a man who painted a mountain and in a desert and discovering the infamous ""Jackalope"" in Douglas Wyoming. And by the time you get through this you'll know them too. 
 

This photograph was taken while I was walking in the New Mexico village of Acoma. The original photograph is in a western Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Five copies will be available as a Perk in Gallery.



 
What's the risk?What about risk we're taking? Besides having written twelve produced movies and rewritten ten more produced movies and five TV series. I also have written two books; one is Emperor of Mars which is a story about a twelve year old boy based on my early life in a small town. The other book, Working Writer's Screenplay
 is based on my teaching screenwriting at University of California L.A. (UCLA) one of the top universities in the world. Both books will be ""Perks"" for 
this project.You can also find out my film credits on  Movie credits and My Film Blog which started in 2009 and continues to offer stories about the movie business, good and bad. I'm also on Facebook jim.makichuk and on youtube at jamakichuk. So what will we risk, all of us? One of the biggest risks is done, the book is written unlike other crowdfunders. And you can be assured that the writing works, after all it's what I've done since grade school. And I've got team players to help.  
So what happens when it all ends? Well, depending on the funding, it will be audited after 30 days by indiegogo.com and at the appropriate time will release the funding for the final work and sending the perks to everyone who donated money for them. 
Here's another quick preview of another story.
From ""A UFO Skeptic at the Holy Grail - New Mexico
""It's two in the morning, I awake to the sound of something incredibly powerful outside, seemingly hovering over the motel room I'm in. If this was L.A., I'd think it was just a police helicopter chasing down a carjacker. But this particular motel is in Roswell, New Mexico. It's where an alleged alien flying saucer crashed in 1947 and spawned a conspiracy debate that has become the foundation of the UFO industry as well as a cottage industry as well. I glance over at my brother's bed. Dave's sound asleep. He's why we're here, having convinced me into taking him to this part of the country by promising that we can visit Santa Fe. He's the family member who's into UFO's, MIB's, MUFON and other abbreviations I never knew existed. Outside, the sound is deep and trembling, I'm not dreaming, I check my wristwatch and look towards the window for those bright lights that streak into the room when aliens arrive."" 
Other stories deal with a secret military base, a woman who breaks the rules, 700 miles across the Canadian winter, a mysterious record album, a place called Rome, the inventor of the television screen and more, And of course a small-town bar. All stories are real and happened to me alone or with my brother Dave.
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people might not be able to contribute but that doesn't mean they can't help. 
  Pass the word; ""How Not To Get Beat-Up In A Small-town Bar."" It will always get a laugh and make people wonder what the story is about. Try it.
I'll send anyone 5 front covers to hand out, Just email me.
 Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it. Thanks for dropping by, stay awhile, have a look at the Gallery at the top where you can see Perks.And tell a friend. Or two. And here's my dad in 1971, Sunday clothes, whose love of cars translated to me and my 1968 Mustang, Loved that car.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Dear Friends,</h3>
<div>
<p>Many of you have donated to my earlier campaign, which ended a few days ago. I'm re-launching a new campaign to cover additional book tour spots that have been added and to try to reach my initial goal so that I can continue the wonderful journey ahead. A hearty thank you to all my generous supporters in advance! </p>
<p>I’ll be coming to city near you this fall to present and sign copies of my debut literary novel, <a href=""http://amzn.to/1TThF8D"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">JUVENTUD</a>, which will be published by Curbside Splendor in October, 2015, The above video features my exciting new book trailer. I hope you enjoy it! </p>
<p>Here’s a brief summary of the novel, the “story behind the story,” and why I need your support:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442635703/pg2jciqblnvsccxhpwxl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Story Summary</h3>
<p><i>Juventud </i>explores the idealism of youth, the complexities of a ravaged country, and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive. Growing up as the only daughter of a wealthy landowner in Santiago de Cali, Colombia, teenaged Mercedes Martinez knows a world of maids, armed guards, and private drivers. When she falls in love with Manuel, a fiery young activist with a passion for his faith and his country, she begins to understand the suffering of the <i>desplazados </i>who share her land. </p>
<p>A startling discovery about her father forces Mercedes to doubt everything she thought she knew about her life, and she and Manuel make plans to run away together. But before they can, tragedy strikes in a single violent night. Mercedes flees Colombia for the United States and a life she never could have imagined. Fifteen years later, she returns to Colombia seeking the truth, but discovers that only more questions await.</p>

<h3>My Journey  </h3>
<p>This riveting story, part sociopolitical thriller and part love story, lyrically told, marks the culmination of the copious research and drafting which I began in 2009, and relied on the support of several writers’ colonies to complete, including Yaddo, Ragdale, the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, and others. </p>
<p>After so many years of working on the project, I am ecstatic that <i>Juventud </i>has found a home with the Chicago-based independent press, Curbside Splendor Publishing, and I am committed to bringing the novel to the widest audience possible upon its release this fall.  In the Northeast I am scheduled to present at the Burlington Book Festival, the Fall for the Book in Fairfax, VA, then will head to launch events in Chicago and Minneapolis, Boston and NYC. In November, the tour heads south and will include my home state of Florida, Savannah, Charleston, Charlotte, Nashville, and D.C. </p>

<h3>Why I Need Your Support</h3>
<p>I need your help and support to cover travel expenses, lodging, and meals from when the launch starts at the end of September to early December, when I will be on leave from my part-time job at Bookmark It in Orlando, FL.

My only source of income during the fall will be the online fiction workshop I’m teaching for UCF, which will allow me to maintain flexibility but will amount to a small paycheck that will just cover monthly essentials. </p>

</div>","Dear Friends,

Many of you have donated to my earlier campaign, which ended a few days ago. I'm re-launching a new campaign to cover additional book tour spots that have been added and to try to reach my initial goal so that I can continue the wonderful journey ahead. A hearty thank you to all my generous supporters in advance! 
I’ll be coming to city near you this fall to present and sign copies of my debut literary novel, JUVENTUD, which will be published by Curbside Splendor in October, 2015, The above video features my exciting new book trailer. I hope you enjoy it! 
Here’s a brief summary of the novel, the “story behind the story,” and why I need your support:


Story Summary
Juventud explores the idealism of youth, the complexities of a ravaged country, and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive. Growing up as the only daughter of a wealthy landowner in Santiago de Cali, Colombia, teenaged Mercedes Martinez knows a world of maids, armed guards, and private drivers. When she falls in love with Manuel, a fiery young activist with a passion for his faith and his country, she begins to understand the suffering of the desplazados who share her land. 
A startling discovery about her father forces Mercedes to doubt everything she thought she knew about her life, and she and Manuel make plans to run away together. But before they can, tragedy strikes in a single violent night. Mercedes flees Colombia for the United States and a life she never could have imagined. Fifteen years later, she returns to Colombia seeking the truth, but discovers that only more questions await.
   
My Journey  
This riveting story, part sociopolitical thriller and part love story, lyrically told, marks the culmination of the copious research and drafting which I began in 2009, and relied on the support of several writers’ colonies to complete, including Yaddo, Ragdale, the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, and others. 
After so many years of working on the project, I am ecstatic that Juventud has found a home with the Chicago-based independent press, Curbside Splendor Publishing, and I am committed to bringing the novel to the widest audience possible upon its release this fall.  In the Northeast I am scheduled to present at the Burlington Book Festival, the Fall for the Book in Fairfax, VA, then will head to launch events in Chicago and Minneapolis, Boston and NYC. In November, the tour heads south and will include my home state of Florida, Savannah, Charleston, Charlotte, Nashville, and D.C. 


Why I Need Your Support
I need your help and support to cover travel expenses, lodging, and meals from when the launch starts at the end of September to early December, when I will be on leave from my part-time job at Bookmark It in Orlando, FL. While the publisher is arranging the tour, they are not funding it. My only source of income during the fall will be the online fiction workshop I’m teaching for UCF, which will allow me to maintain flexibility but will amount to a small paycheck that will just cover monthly essentials.

</h3> <p></p>
<p><i>Eight years ago when Laton was kidnapped and tortured, she had killed to survive. Now that her baby
brother becomes the latest victim of a wave of children abductions, her worst
nightmare turns real. When the kidnappers set the ransom so high, as if counting
on her inability to pay it off, she rushes to the authorities. Yet, the
police seem to stonewall the investigation. <br/></i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The only way for Laton to raise her brother’s ransom is to
enlist herself as test subject in a lethal research. But if she is as
good as dead, why do the attempts on her life start piling up?</i></p>

<br/>

A fast-paced thriller, placed in a science-fiction near-future setting, Black00 is a celebration of determination and resilience. Seen through the eyes of a sister and a brother, Laton and Sabin, the story follows their journey to find each other and unravel the mystery
that ties their family to Black00. <br/><br/>With this story, I sought to reinterpret the 
thriller
and science fiction genres in a more accessible form, even for fans unfamiliar with either one of these genres. The 100,000-word manuscript is complete and edited. <br/><br/><p></p>

<br/><h3>Who Created Black00?

</h3>I'm an author based in Massachusetts, invested body and soul into making Black00 a reality. Since my youth, 
I've been fascinated by all
forms of art, from writing to music, painting, sculpture, and 
photography. For
the last years I've been dedicated to blending my passion for 
storytelling with my formal business training and market analysis 
experience. I've been
involved in various projects employing my skills in writing, editing, 
and
visual arts. Aside from storytelling, I maintain a blog about the 
economic aspects of the publishing
industry, while working as a software developer for business and 
statistical
applications.<br/><br/>In order to bring Black00 to life, I've teamed up 
with some amazing people who gave their talent, time, and energy so you could 
enjoy a prime quality story. <br/><br/>

<h3>How Will Your Money Be Used?

</h3>
<p>I've already invested some of my own money into this project--I'm supporting the costs of the structural edit and the line edit, along with all the costs of creating this campaign and designing the cover. Now that these production steps were taken, I need to raise $6,000 to get the first printing done--which includes the final proofread of the manuscript and shipping the books to you. <br/></p>
<p>The larger the volume of total orders the 
lower the overall production and shipping cost that I will be able to 
negotiate. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464823329/Cost2_xjyfdp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<ul> <li>What does the production cost of the physical books include? Manufacturing cost using 100% Forest-Stewardship-Council-certified paper and/or recycled paper + Proof copy + Set-up fee. <br/>
</li>
<li>How are the ISBN costs calculated? Each format (softcover, hardcover, 
e-book) requires an individual ISBN number. The price is $125/one ISBN or
 $300/10 ISBN.</li>
<li>How are the IndieGoGo and Paypal fees calculated? 5% IndieGoGo + 3-5% 
Paypal transactions depending on your method of payment and geographical
 location + $0.30 fixed fee per transaction for U.S. (international 
fixed fee varies).</li>
<li>
<p>How is the shipping cost calculated?
After lengthy research, I concluded that the best U.S. shipping rates are about
$4.00 U.S. offered by USPS as media mail. For international orders, one of the
printing companies offers a flat rate of $12.00/paperback and $15/hardcover for all zones outside the U.S. Then the shipping supplies have been added to obtain the final cost.<br/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All shipping rates, particularly the
international ones, are sensitive to fuel price variations. The comparative
rates presented below were calculated at the end of May 2016, using the
calculators provided by USPS, UPS, and various printing companies, which offer
individual distribution options.</p>

<br/><h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>I added various perks available at different price ranges. I've included quite a few early-bird perks because I want a lot of people to be able to experience Black00. Please take a look at the

pledge to Black00.</p>

<br/>
<p>Any donation of $1 or more will get you a flash story never published
 before (not set in the Glaukos Universe) along with my thank-you 
message. I'll also update you with the
progress of this project during production and printing, and add you to 
my website as an
official supporter.
</p>
<p>In addition, any donation of $4 or more plus the Early Bird
Digital gets you a special digitally signed edition of the e-book. And 
because I don't want you to be locked-in by the brand of your first 
ereader, you'll receive the book in every available format (EPUB, MOBI, 
and PDF) so you can upload Black00 on any device you own. Please note 
that the EPUB format is compatible with iBooks. 
</p>
<p>Any pledge of $50 or more (made in any combination of perks or perks 
and extra contributions) will be listed in the Acknowledgements.
</p>
<p>I tried to cover most perk bundling options, based on
various printing format. However, if you'd like to get a different combination, 
please contact me. Also should you have
suggestions about other perks you'd like to have or ways to support this
project, feel free to contact me directly. I'm always open to new ideas.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<br/>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>The overall risks are small. I have a Masters Degree in Resource Economics and years of experience as a market analyst. The manuscript is already completed and edited, the cover is designed, and I've identified a suitable printing company and rewards suppliers. The prices listed are based on in-depth research of various alternatives. The main challenges  are related to delays due to the printing process and distribution. Also individual items are being produced by
 independent developers--hence, there may be delays in distribution or suppliers may change their offers before I can place the IndieGoGo orders. If this happens, I 
will have to find an alternative printing company, alternative suppliers, and/or alternative distribution channels. However I am confident I can get Black00 safely into your hands.<br/><br/><p></p>
<h3>Go Green

</h3>
<p>Without forests, humanity would face a bleak fate. Deforestation and forest
degradation threaten the quality of the air we breathe, by adding up to 15% of
global greenhouse gas emissions. Trees play the role of insulation for the
planet and help to maintain stable temperatures, therefore controlling climate
change. 
</p>
<p>I am passionate about promoting an eco-friendly mindset, which is why
 I've chosen to produce Black00 only from 
high quality sustainable and recycled paper. The physical books you'll receive will be printed
100% on Forest-Stewardship-Council-certified paper and/or recycled paper. For rewards, I'll use local suppliers in order to reduce the fuel consumption and therefore the carbon footprint.</p>

20 años que integro un grupo de gestión cultural uruguayo. Para conocerme, nada
mejor que visitar el sitio web que da cuenta de las actividades a que estamos
abocados desde siempre: abrelabios
Este proyecto es valioso y
posible no solo por mi participación, sino fundamentalmente porque cuento con
el apoyo (y la experiencia acumulada) de mis colegas de abrelabios. Es decir,
soy la cara visible de la propuesta, pero su culminación exitosa se deberá a
nuestro trabajo mancomunado. La colaboración que te pido se sumará a ese trabajo
colectivo.
miniaturas a lo grande es un producto sencillo: la edición de una
colección de 20 títulos de literatura latinoamericana (en formato de tarjeta
personal) para distribución gratuita principalmente en centros educativos de
nivel medio y/o superior. Seleccionaremos escritores reconocidos del ámbito
latinoamericano (de habla hispana o portuguesa) y también escritores noveles para
estimular sus capacidades creativas.
En suma, estamos hablando de una colección de literatura latinoamericana
(con un tiraje de 500 ejemplares por título), lo que significa diez mil
libros para distribución gratuita. Esa es la meta si alcanzáramos el monto total
propuesto. En caso que fuera menor, llevaremos a cabo el proyecto pero de

Plot Summary""Long live the king! Long live Erodin!”The Southern Kingdom resounds with the praise of its monarch, lavishly celebrating his 50th year on the throne. However, behind this festive façade the country is seething with discontent. As the king's mind increasingly becomes clouded by paranoia, he no longer shies away from introducing radical means to rule his kingdom, pushing it into an army ruled, dictatorial state.No wonder that the Falcons, the court's special corps of “fixers” have their hands full of work. Hardly having returned from their last quest, Elion and her team has been given another assignment: to investigate the cause of some mysterious disappearances occurring in the once-flourishing mining town of Wenheilm. And if being pressed for time weren't troublesome enough, they also have to put up with the king's overzealous son who foists himself upon them in an attempt to prove his worthiness to his dismissive father.CharactersElion is a young woman in her thirties. Her past experience has rendered her worldly-wise and shrewd. About twenty years ago, Elion became a member of the Falcons, when, thanks to her resourcefulness and command of languages, helped them to deal with a very delicate situation. They are currently employed in the king's service.Erodal is the ruler of the Southern Kingdom. Despite his advanced age, he is still a vigorous, feisty man. Although he has always been very prudent, some believe that his excessive wariness is turning into paranoia and that he'll eventually lead the country to a full-scale bloody war...Alton is the king's youngest son. Neglected by his father, he has grown a restless and foolhardy man, always trying to prove his aptitude to gain his father's admiration and love.Doltan is the king's councillor, a true patriot with a healthy appetite for power. Many believe that this quick-witted, sensible man is aspiring to the throne – which, they add, probably wouldn't be such a bad change...Why do I need 11.000 euros?  A part of the money goes for Indiegogo, when the campaign is successful. I also need to pay taxes, after the donations, so around 30% of the money is gone.If the project is successful, certain fees and taxes are applied which means that about 30% of the money will be deducted.The translation will cost about 4000€. The editing and correction will be around 1000€. For the illustrations I'll have to pay another 1000€.Other expenses include royalty and advertising.Don't forget! The novel will be downloadable from the internet FREE OF COST.Other ways you can helpLet people know about Ransom for Freedom!

<h3><strong>Help Translate and Publish “Det Globale Perspektiv”</strong></h3>
<p>Since 1998, Kersplebedeb Publishing has been a source of radical literature attempting to contribute to an understanding of how the world works, and to keeping alive (or rekindling) the memory of resistance. We've published works by J. Sakai, Butch Lee, Zak Cope, Sanyika Shakur, JMP, and numerous others, attempting to chart an innovative, radical, theoretical way forward in today’s neo-colonial terrain.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 80s, Torkil Lauesen was a member of a clandestine communist cell which carried out a series of robberies in Denmark, netting very large sums which were then sent on to various national liberation movements in the Third World. Following their capture in 1989, Torkil would spend six years in prison. In 2016, Torkil’s book <i>Det Globale Perspektiv</i> was released in Denmark. In it, he explains how he sees the world political situation today, and his thoughts about the future.</p>
<p>Torkil’s books bridges the gap between Third Worldist theory, and the question of “What Is To Be Done?” in a First World context. It is an important contribution towards developing an effective political practice based on the realities of the global situation, avoiding the pitfalls of sugarcoating the situation with the First World populations, or of falling into pessimistic quietism. As Torkil says, “It is a book written by an activist, for activists. Global capitalism is heading into a deep structural crisis in the coming decades, so the objective conditions for radical change will be present, for better or for worse. The outcome will depend on us, the subjective forces.”</p>
<p>To make this book available in English, we will need funds to hire a translator and to help defray the printing costs. This is where your help can make a major difference!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We need $4,500 to publish this book. This money will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The full translation costs ($3,000)</li>
<li>Roughly one third of the printing costs ($1,500)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are looking for $6,000, as the various costs associated with Indiegogo, and with providing gifts to donors, are expected to account for one quarter of the total donations we receive (i.e. if one gives $100, Indiegogo will take $5, and the cost of mailing you the thank-you gift you will receive will be at least $20).</p>
<p>So long as $3,000 is raised, we will proceed with translation. The amount raised in excess will be used to help spread the book as far as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Global Perspective: Ethics, Politics, and Action in an Unequal World</strong></h3>
<p>Never before has the world been so starkly divided between the “haves” and the “have nots”. Never before has the global situation been accelerating so quickly. The Third World national liberation movements of the 20th century very much triggered the liberatory movements that did manage to emerge in the First World, and seemed for an all-too-brief moment to point to an escape hatch from history’s downward spiral ... but for many today that all seems like ancient history.</p>
<p>Torkil Lauesen was a participant in the communist and internationalist struggles during the tail end of the national liberation period, and today remains committed to the ideals that motivated him then.  The Global Perspective is an important contribution, bridging not only generations, but also the gap between theory and practice.</p>
<p>Kersplebedeb has published numerous books outlining the need for a global view, one that centers the struggles of the most oppressed, on a world scale. With your help, we will be able to add The Global Perspective to this list.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Not everyone has money to donate to a project, even though they may want to. We understand that completely. But even if you can’t make a donation at this point, there’s lots you can do to help us in this campaign:</p>

<li>Please share this Indiegogo campaign on social media, i.e. facebook, twitter, and all those places. Consider reposting it on your website, in your newsletter, or anywhere else.</li>
<li> As we share news stories about The Global Perspective over the next month, please consider reposting these in your own networks.</li>

<p>Hi, I'm Zsuzsi Hussla and I'm passionate about women's health and educating others about important topics such as how to heal your menstrual cycle, how to handle PMS, why tracking your menstrual cycle is beneficial to your life- not just your fertility, and being a courageous and strong woman. </p>
<p>My passion grows stronger each day as we face the many issues of women's health being addressed by politician hopefuls in the coming Presidential election. We hear about defunding Planned Parenthood, banning abortions and a general lack of choice when it comes to women's bodies while sex education in schools is failing miserably. Teen pregnancy is at an all time high and begging for attention to the obvious: education is key, particularly for young women and it is the solution to these increasing problems. </p>
<p>This is why I am publishing this book and sharing my wisdom with women and men alike. I have already completed writing the manuscript and it is currently being edited. I'm just a couple steps from self-publishing my first book!</p>

<br/>
<p>In my early twenties, I suffered from many menstrual conditions and found myself at a loss for how to deal with my irregular cycle, painful menses and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. After years of research, experimentation and spiritual growth, I found healing in my body and spirit that has been profound for my feminine expression as a woman in today's world. </p>
<p>As a Certified Herbalist, Certified Somatic Movement Therapist, with a Bachelors degree in Dance and Holistic Health, and as a Professional dancer, I have paired my learning through various experiences of following my intuition and higher self and developed a template which can be used by women to release herself from the bonds of what feminine ""should be"" and allow her true self to shine. </p>
<p>As a dancer, I have developed a unique dance therapy method called Wombyn's Rhythms- that assists women in unraveling long held beliefs and conditioned patterns in their body about the feminine perspective- specifically around menstruation- and unleashing her inner wise woman. With the funding of this campaign, you will assist me in making these teachings more available to women.</p>

This Wombyn's Rhythms center would include classes and workshops on body movement, healthy living, plus a cafe & tea/smoothie bar, an atrium & garden, as well as a space for evening dance events. A sanctuary for the new-generation-wo/man to be revived and remember their true purpose in life.   
Risks & Challenges I don't have much risk involved with this project, especially since I have completed the manuscript and am in the editing process. My contract is already set with Balboa Press and I perceive no known problems. With everything on track, the book will be published in the Winter of 2015/6, likely around the new year.

<div>My name is Wesley Mayer, I am a photographer from Traverse City, Michigan. For the past several years I have been following the Syrian Refugee Crisis closely. I have come to truly believe that this is the greatest tragedy of our generation, 4 million people have had to give up their lives and attempt to survive in a world that is hesitant to accept them, and quick to exploit them. Through their travels to find a new place to live, Syrian refugees face discrimination, deportation, and general lack of human care. Many people in the region, instead of providing aid for people in need, see it as an opportunity to make money. Syrians looking for a boat to Greece can expect charges of 1,500 euros per head for an incredibly dangerous boat packed absolutely to the top with people. Taxi rides can cost up to 150 euros for a short ride. Along with the discrimination they face as migrants, the overall situation looks quite bleak.</div>

<div>I don't want to focus on the negative. My goal is to travel to Turkey, where over 2.1 million refugees are currently stranded, and find stories of people who have provided outstanding human compassion and highlight them. I want to interact directly with the refugees, provide aid where I can, and collect stories and photos to bring back to my community to hopefully help raise even more awareness and aid for those who need it most at this time. </div>
<div>Any and all help you can give to help me get on the ground in Turkey and make sure I am able to get where I need to go, would be more appreciated than you could ever know. Please take the time to look at my goals and consider making a donation, I want to do something more than I ever would be able to alone, your help will be appreciated for the rest of my life.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>My Project Needs and What You Will Get</h3>
<div>The money I am raising will be mostly to cover my travel and housing costs, I had hoped to be able to give a solid breakdown of where this money would be going but there is no way to tell specifically what travel and lodging will cost. The goal of $3,500 is based on estimated airfare and the materials I will need, along with some for actual aid. A portion will go towards photography and travel gear directly related towards photojournalism, and another small amount will go to cover personal safety classes for photographers in Istanbul.</div>
<div>A brief breakdown,</div>
<div>$1500 for travel</div>
<div>$1000 for supplies, food and training</div>
<div>$1000 for direct aid and incidentals along the way.</div>
<div>The most important part of your donation however will be that ANY excess funds will go directly to refugees in need. After I have achieved all I need to, I will use all of the money donated to my project to buy aid or help refugees in any way I can. This is the most fantastic part of this donation, as when you donate to a large aid agency it is hard to see the direct impact of your help. With my project, you will see photos of the people whose lives you have made better. You will be able to interact with humans on the other side of the world and know the difference you made. I make that pledge for accountability, whenever I provide aid I will combine it with a story and photos.<br/>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Will Achieve</h3>
<p>I am an American, and a world citizen. I believe that no matter where we are geographically located we have a responsibility to every good person on Earth to show compassion and care when they are in need. We as Americans have had a degree of separation that those living in the Middle East and Europe have not had, we have kept ourselves fairly disconnected from the crisis. I want to change that, I would like to help bring more Americans to the discussion on how to best help the millions of men, women, and children who need it. Through weaving interactions on a personal basis with refugees and attempting to place my audience in their shoes, I hope to show that refugees are not inhuman subjects of xenophobia, but people who have escaped incredible evil and trauma that deserve a chance to start over. </p>
<p>I am a self-sufficient traveler, and an accomplished photographer. This will be my first endeavor in photojournalism or large-scale aid effort. I am confident that this project will be hugely successful, I am passionate about my goals and know what I want to achieve. I have been researching and am well aware of the situation that I am trying to improve. This is a project I have been finessing for months and months, I know that with your help we can make a difference in the world. I expect to travel from Turkey through Europe to Germany. I think that every step in the refugees' journey has different components and they are all important. </p>

<p>Why back a brand-new magazine? Aside
from the fact that it’s going to be great, we also think our principles are
important. You may have heard that the average American is three generations removed from the farm. You may be hearing a lot of buzzwords in the news, not understand what they mean (and don't care to read a research paper or abstract to find out) and wonder if a genetically modified crop or a grain-finished beef animal is an OK part of your diet. You may also buy chicken that's marketed as ""raised without added hormones,"" when in fact all US chickens are raised without added hormones! (That's your fun fact of the day.)</p>
<p>We’re connecting you back to the science behind the food you eat and
the clothes you wear by sharing the stories of those who live it every day. We want to be Georgia's premiere source for agricultural storytelling of all aspects, whether it's an organic garlic farmer in north Georgia learning the ins and outs of marketing or a multi-generational producer telling the story of his family's hundred-acre farm and how his cattle travel to a Kansas feedlot to become our beef. </p>
<p>Think about it. Everything you wear and eat was grown or made by someone. The inputs that went into creating those ingredients, foods and fibers were based on sound scientific research ... which sometimes is hard to find or understand. That's where we come in!</p>
<p>And the coolest part is that our staff is
going to be 75 percent contributor-based. There’s not a lot of people out there
who dedicate their professions to documenting all of these aspects of Georgia
and Southern culture and agriculture. We want to be a paying outlet for those
who are, and for those who want a break from daily newspapers to tell a story.</p>
