My name is Joe Sicilia.  When I was 17 I was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy.  I'm in my 40's now and have been using a cane or crutches basically since I was first diagnosed.  The problem is that cane/crutch tips have very little texture or traction. Whenever I transition from the snow or rain outside to a smooth surface (like hardwood floors) on the inside, I find my cane/crutches tend to slip and lose traction.  Most of the current solutions use spikes or other technology that cannot be used indoors. Most current solutions require the cane/crutch user to adjust or unscrew the traction device - which is messy and often those of us with chronic diseases like Muscular Dystrophy don't have good hand dexterity to perform these tasks. The solution to this problem must be a product that can be used both indoors and outdoors, must be hands-free, and must have a lot of extra traction for more stability.  So my wife (a registered nurse) and I have created a patent-pending solution.  We have created a cane/ crutch tip that is safe for indoor/ outdoor use, hands-free, inexpensive, and creates more traction and friction surface-areas for more stability.  Together with your funding, our idea can change the lives of millions of people who use a cane or crutches in order to safely move around on a daily basis.   What We Need & What You Get 


To start with we are asking for $5000.  This funding will help us create a marketing plan and tools as well as begin to manufacture our product on a larger scale.
 Additionally, the funding will be used to fund a trip to a convention where I was invited to showcase my product to potential licensors and marketing professionals - this is a big opportunity to meet the necessary people to help launch my product.
 For helping fund our product you will get in on the ground floor of this revolutionary new product as well as you may even get an opportunity to develop our logo and name our product depending on your donation.    The Impact  This product has the ability to drastically improve the life of someone who is crutch/ cane dependent. I'm sure we all know someone who needs to use a cane/ crutch to move around on a permanent basis - our product can give them some extra freedom and confidence by having a more stable walking platform.    Risks & Challenges  We feel the risks and challenges are minimal.  While we are still developing our manufacturing partners, we do have the ability to begin manufacturing right now, although on a much lower scale.  Therefore we will be able to provide our perks and go forward with trying to find a partner with which to enter into a licensing agreement.
    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't afford to contribute financially you can still help by spreading the word about our product to all of your FaceBook and online friends.  Additionally, Indiegogo has tools you can use to help spread the word.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We took some very popular ingredients in the marketplace that people are using everyday.We took Aspirin for pain relief. We took MSM & Glucosamine for your joints. We took Arnica which is a natural homeopathic ingredient for pain relief.And we took those ingredients and we put them in a microscopic onion. And that encapsulation is delivered through the skin into the area where you need pain relief the most. We thought about people are taking these things orally, but we wanted to provide a treatment that you could rub just on the site of pain.

<p>The StandUp Walker combines the ease of a walker with an innovative stand-assist device that helps the user to easily and safely stand up.  The StandUp Walker fills the void of
three primary products that nearly all mobility-challenged patients use – a
Standard Walker, Toilet Safety Rails &amp; Seat Lift Mechanism.  Ultimately it helps people who have mobility issues to get up and go from just about any seated position.  It's the perfect device for home and on the go!  </p>

The StandUp Walker combines the ease of a walker with an innovative stand-assist device that helps the user to easily and safely stand up.  The StandUp Walker fills the void of
three primary products that nearly all mobility-challenged patients use – a
Standard Walker, Toilet Safety Rails & Seat Lift Mechanism.  Ultimately it helps people who have mobility issues to get up and go from just about any seated position.  It's the perfect device for home and on the go!

<p><b>1. How does [Sleep Master]do?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p> [Sleep Master] belongs
to the scope of music therapy, its mechanism is not only to be able to ease the
psychological pressure and causes the body to relax, more important is that
through the unique BBT (Binaural Beats Technology) ,it can act directly on the
control center to promote brain wave frequency conversion, induce the human
body quickly into deep sleep. Research found that 30 minutes of θ wave state
can reduce up to four hours of sleep needs, equivalent to 4 hours of normal
sleep.</p>
<p><b>2.EEG
and the brain’s state?</b></p>
<p>EEG(Electroencephalography) technology is
used to measure brain’s electrical vibrations from the suface of the scalp.The
resulting EEG pattern will contain frequency elements mainly below 30Hz.The
frequencies are categorized into four states as follows:</p>
<p> 
• Beta-14Hz-30Hz-Highly alert and focused</p>
<p> 
• Alpha-8Hz-14Hz-Relaxed but alert</p>
<p> 
• Theta-4Hz-8Hz-Drowsiness(also first stage of sleep)</p>
<p> 
• Delta-0.5Hz-4Hz-Deep sleep</p>
<p> 
The dominant frequency in the EEG pattern determines what shall be called the
current state of the brain.If the amplitude of the alpha range frequencies is
highest,then the brain is said to be in the alpha stage .Note,that other
frequencies still exist and it is impossible to give any “exact frequency your
brain is operating on”.</p>
<p><b>3. Entraining
the brain to a desired state</b></p>
<p>  If external stimulus is applied to
the brain, it becomes possible to entrain the brain frequency from one stage to
another. For example, if a person is in beta stage (highly alert) and a
stimulus of 10Hz is applied to his/her brain for some time,the brain frequency
is likely to change towards the applied stimulus. The effect will be relaxing
to the person. This phenomenon is also called frequency following response.
When the brain’s state is close to the applied stimulus,entrainment works more
efficiently. Thus,when doing a sweep from one frequency to another,the starting
frequency should be as close to your current brain state as possible. The sweep
speed should be such that your brain’s state changes steadily with it,so that
the difference never gets very large. In practice, it is difficult to determine
your brain state without extra equipment(like EEG devices).However,you can
quite safely assume that during the day your brain is in the beta stage(about
20Hz) and you can start the sweep from there.If you are already somewhat
relaxed,you can use a start frequency of 15Hz or a few Hz lower.</p>
<p><b>4. Stimulating
the brain with binaural beat frequencies</b></p>
<p>The easiest way of applying stimulus to the
brain is via ears.Other senses could be used as well,and vision is actually
used quite often(often in addition to hearing).However,humans cannot hear
sounds low enough to be useful for brain stimulation,so special techniques must
be used.One such special technique used is called binaural beats.</p>
<p> 
If the left ear is presented with a steady tone of 500Hz and the right ear a
steady tone of 510Hz,these two tones combine in the brain.The difference,10Hz,is
perceived by the brain and is a very effective stimulus for brainwave
entrainment.This 10Hz is formed entirely by the brain.When using stereo
headphones,the left and right sounds do not mix together until in your
brain.The frequency difference,when perceived by brain this way,is called a
binaural beat.</p>
<p><b>5. How
about BBT&amp;BBT products?</b></p>
<p>Binaural beat technology (BBT) products are
sold internationally as personal development and health improvement tools.
Producers suggest benefit from regular listening to binaural beats including
reduced stress and anxiety, and increased focus, concentration, motivation,
confidence, and depth in meditation. Binaural beats are auditory brainstem
responses that originate in the superior olivary nucleus as a result of different
frequency auditory stimuli provided to each ear. Listeners to binaural beat
""hear"" a beat at a frequency equal to the difference between the
frequencies of the applied tones.</p>
<p><b>6. Effectiveness
of binaural beats</b></p>
<p>• Reduce stress</p>
<p> 
• Achieve deep relaxation</p>
<p> 
• Enhance Creativity</p>
<p> 
• Improve motivation</p>
<p> 
• Quit smoking</p>
<p> 
• Lose weight</p>
<p> 
• Overcome depression and anxiety</p>
<p> 
• Alleviate pain</p>
<p> 
• Increase self confidence</p>
<p> 
• Eliminate unwanted habits</p>
<p> 
• Accelerate energy</p>
<p> 
• Improve Sleep</p>

body quickly into deep sleep. Research found that 30 minutes of θ wave state
can reduce up to four hours of sleep needs, equivalent to 4 hours of normal
sleep.
2.EEG
and the brain’s state?
EEG(Electroencephalography) technology is
used to measure brain’s electrical vibrations from the suface of the scalp.The
resulting EEG pattern will contain frequency elements mainly below 30Hz.The
frequencies are categorized into four states as follows:
 
• Beta-14Hz-30Hz-Highly alert and focused
 
• Alpha-8Hz-14Hz-Relaxed but alert
 
• Theta-4Hz-8Hz-Drowsiness(also first stage of sleep)
 
• Delta-0.5Hz-4Hz-Deep sleep
 
The dominant frequency in the EEG pattern determines what shall be called the
current state of the brain.If the amplitude of the alpha range frequencies is
highest,then the brain is said to be in the alpha stage .Note,that other
frequencies still exist and it is impossible to give any “exact frequency your
brain is operating on”.
3. Entraining
the brain to a desired state
  If external stimulus is applied to
the brain, it becomes possible to entrain the brain frequency from one stage to
another. For example, if a person is in beta stage (highly alert) and a
stimulus of 10Hz is applied to his/her brain for some time,the brain frequency
is likely to change towards the applied stimulus. The effect will be relaxing
to the person. This phenomenon is also called frequency following response.
When the brain’s state is close to the applied stimulus,entrainment works more
efficiently. Thus,when doing a sweep from one frequency to another,the starting
frequency should be as close to your current brain state as possible. The sweep
speed should be such that your brain’s state changes steadily with it,so that
the difference never gets very large. In practice, it is difficult to determine
your brain state without extra equipment(like EEG devices).However,you can
quite safely assume that during the day your brain is in the beta stage(about
20Hz) and you can start the sweep from there.If you are already somewhat
relaxed,you can use a start frequency of 15Hz or a few Hz lower.
4. Stimulating
the brain with binaural beat frequencies
The easiest way of applying stimulus to the
brain is via ears.Other senses could be used as well,and vision is actually
used quite often(often in addition to hearing).However,humans cannot hear
sounds low enough to be useful for brain stimulation,so special techniques must
be used.One such special technique used is called binaural beats.
 
If the left ear is presented with a steady tone of 500Hz and the right ear a
steady tone of 510Hz,these two tones combine in the brain.The difference,10Hz,is
perceived by the brain and is a very effective stimulus for brainwave
entrainment.This 10Hz is formed entirely by the brain.When using stereo
headphones,the left and right sounds do not mix together until in your
brain.The frequency difference,when perceived by brain this way,is called a
binaural beat.
5. How
about BBT&BBT products?
Binaural beat technology (BBT) products are
sold internationally as personal development and health improvement tools.
Producers suggest benefit from regular listening to binaural beats including
reduced stress and anxiety, and increased focus, concentration, motivation,
confidence, and depth in meditation. Binaural beats are auditory brainstem
responses that originate in the superior olivary nucleus as a result of different
frequency auditory stimuli provided to each ear. Listeners to binaural beat
""hear"" a beat at a frequency equal to the difference between the
frequencies of the applied tones.
6. Effectiveness

Spread the word!

What do people say about the training?
93% of participants believed the training changed their life. 85% of health professionals believed it changed their care of patients. Read some comments.

What's in a Toolkit?
This word chart illustrates some of the 7 realms concepts that are included within the training sessions of each toolkit. The training is personalized to each individual through an assessment to find out ""who are you?"", establish personal goals on ""who do you want to be?"", and self-paced training videos to ""be the person you want to be"" in preventing chronic pain.  Training videos are evidence-based, informative, creative, and experiential. The training is about you!

It is true that our current health care system is fragmented and inflexible since health systems, health plans, and reimbursements often dictate treatments and thus, little training is offered to patients. Health care can become more health-oriented when people demand it. That's why this is the People's Campaign is on crowd-funding site. You become the force of change!
Why is chronic pain such a problem?
Whether it is back pain,
neck pain, headache, facial pain, or others, the personal impact of chronic pain in terms of suffering, loss of function, depression, addiction, loss of work, conflict, and other consequences is incalculable. Since we all have pain conditions
at some point in our lives, you need to know how to prevent chronic pain. So, please keep reading!Nobody teaches us how to prevent chronic pain. 
We spend billions of dollars
on amazing advances in pharmaceuticals, devices, surgeries, and other innovative
treatments for pain conditions, yet often fail to deliver long-term successful
relief primarily due to the lack of engaging, empowering, and educating
patients in simple self-management strategies to reduce risk factors and enhance
protective factors that will prevent chronic pain. You can change this!

I am a martial artist, personal trainer and, health and fitness </span>fanatic<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Since the 8th grade, I've always wanted to teach, even though I didn't know exactly what I wanted to teach. Once I started martial arts, I knew that I wanted to practice for the rest of my life. Through martial arts I became a </span>kick-boxer, boxer, and finally made my way to mixed martial arts. It was through my passion with combat sports that I began taking interest and learning more about health and fitness. That's when I knew that I wanted to become a health and fitness professional and use that passion to help make a positive impact on the lives of others, which I can honestly say without first realizing it, I've been doing just that.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FCb7qZQfsMyo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCb7qZQfsMyo%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCb7qZQfsMyo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I am a HUGE superhero fan. I think of them as more than just entertainment, I think of them as inspiration to aspire to. As such, its always been my goal to be a real life superhero and find a way to give back to the world. The only way I know I can do that is through my passion of martial arts and health and fitness. My dream and goal for many years has been to open my own gym and use it to help make a difference in the community. I want my gym to be the place people can go to just get away from the stress of the world or where kids (or adults) can come find and learn discipline to focus on becoming the best person they can possibly become.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've been voted most likely to succeed in high school. Friends and strangers alike have said that I inspired them when all I was doing was not giving up on what I believed. I've struggled through martial arts, combat sports, being jobless and even homeless at a point. I want to be able to be that ""hero"" I and many others believe I can be.</span></p>
<p>Reaching this goal will mean that years of hard work, practice, and struggles, can be used to give back to the community the best way I know how. Through health, fitness and, martial arts.</p>
<p>What I will need:</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>After doing calculations on how much each piece of equipment cost(to own), the estimated costs of rent, electric, insurance, advertisements, phone, etc., I would need about 45,000 dollars just to open a location and own all the equipment. My best friend is also a personal trainer and we would be running the business together. The extra 5,000 dollars would be for any emergencies or slow months we may have. </p>
<p>Besides the basic membership options, I plan to have an advanced martial arts program and special discounts for students with a valid school ID of any type of school. I'd also like to at some point start a daycare or after school program once the gym is able to maintain itself. I will also offer affordable personal training, nutrition counseling and, family membership options.</p>
<p>This is my life goal and even if I don't reach the monetary goal, whatever I do receive or any extra will be put in an interest baring savings account so that my dream will one day become a reality.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact:</h3> <p>I live in America and one of the biggest problems (among many) we face is obesity and other illnesses that can be reduced through a healthy lifestyle. Many of the conditions brought on by illnesses and conditions from lack of health or fitness factors are considered chronic illnesses. Leading a healthy lifestyle by joining a gym such as the one I plan to create can help make people happier and more productive. It can give people an outlet for stress even stop kids from turning to a life of crime. Studies have shown that chronic health conditions indirectly take an effect on the economy, so encouraging and helping people become healthier will even help boost the economy.</p>
<p>I've been a personal trainer for three years and have seen a lot of people become happier and healthier little by little each day. I've watched kids come in excited to tell how they've stood up to bullies without having to turn to violence or running away. A man who has become a good friend of mine was on the verge of leaving a gym I work at when we had a fitness challenge. His wife made him enter and asked myself and other trainers to push him. Not only did he lose 31 pounds in 3 months, but he won the competition and has become happier and more motivated to get to the gym almost daily.</p>
<p>I also plan to make it a place for the holidays. I want to have thanksgiving dinners and the such for everyone who doesn't have a family, just doesn't want to cook, or just wants to eat.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> One of the biggest risk with opening a gym is just getting people to sign up. Even after signing up no matter how affordable a gym may be, people do have other obligations in life that may prevent them from being able to pay on time or at all. I am able to understand what it's like to be in the position to not be able to afford something or to not be able to pay on time. I know from being in a gym that certain months will be busier than others and that people may have to cancel. </p>
<p>I plan to solve these problems by being affordable number one, but also I plan to work with people and find the best way to adjust so that I can still make a profit, but still keep them as a member. If I have to make a special deal that isn't going to cost the business more than I will be willing to do so. </p>
<p>Another plan I have is to have personal trainers who are independent contractors. Meaning they would make their own prices and train as many or few clients as they desire or could but, they would have to pay a small monthly fee in order to train clients at the gym. This would be a great way to keep the gym from needing to pay extra for employees while still gaining money and allowing members to have a variety of unique trainers to fit each of of their unique personalities and training needs.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Maybe you like my plan but cannot afford to make a contribution? Maybe you have fitness gear that you want to donate? Maybe you network with others who can?</p>
<p>I'm asking for help and I will only turn it down from illegal means so, if you are able to help in any way, shape or, form, please do so. Even if the biggest thing you can do would be to share this on social media that may be all it takes for someone who may be able to do a little more to do just that.</p>

Since the 8th grade, I've always wanted to teach, even though I didn't know exactly what I wanted to teach. Once I started martial arts, I knew that I wanted to practice for the rest of my life. Through martial arts I became a kick-boxer, boxer, and finally made my way to mixed martial arts. It was through my passion with combat sports that I began taking interest and learning more about health and fitness. That's when I knew that I wanted to become a health and fitness professional and use that passion to help make a positive impact on the lives of others, which I can honestly say without first realizing it, I've been doing just that.

I am a HUGE superhero fan. I think of them as more than just entertainment, I think of them as inspiration to aspire to. As such, its always been my goal to be a real life superhero and find a way to give back to the world. The only way I know I can do that is through my passion of martial arts and health and fitness. My dream and goal for many years has been to open my own gym and use it to help make a difference in the community. I want my gym to be the place people can go to just get away from the stress of the world or where kids (or adults) can come find and learn discipline to focus on becoming the best person they can possibly become.
I've been voted most likely to succeed in high school. Friends and strangers alike have said that I inspired them when all I was doing was not giving up on what I believed. I've struggled through martial arts, combat sports, being jobless and even homeless at a point. I want to be able to be that ""hero"" I and many others believe I can be.
Reaching this goal will mean that years of hard work, practice, and struggles, can be used to give back to the community the best way I know how. Through health, fitness and, martial arts.
What I will need:

 After doing calculations on how much each piece of equipment cost(to own), the estimated costs of rent, electric, insurance, advertisements, phone, etc., I would need about 45,000 dollars just to open a location and own all the equipment. My best friend is also a personal trainer and we would be running the business together. The extra 5,000 dollars would be for any emergencies or slow months we may have. 
Besides the basic membership options, I plan to have an advanced martial arts program and special discounts for students with a valid school ID of any type of school. I'd also like to at some point start a daycare or after school program once the gym is able to maintain itself. I will also offer affordable personal training, nutrition counseling and, family membership options.
This is my life goal and even if I don't reach the monetary goal, whatever I do receive or any extra will be put in an interest baring savings account so that my dream will one day become a reality.   The Impact: I live in America and one of the biggest problems (among many) we face is obesity and other illnesses that can be reduced through a healthy lifestyle. Many of the conditions brought on by illnesses and conditions from lack of health or fitness factors are considered chronic illnesses. Leading a healthy lifestyle by joining a gym such as the one I plan to create can help make people happier and more productive. It can give people an outlet for stress even stop kids from turning to a life of crime. Studies have shown that chronic health conditions indirectly take an effect on the economy, so encouraging and helping people become healthier will even help boost the economy.
I've been a personal trainer for three years and have seen a lot of people become happier and healthier little by little each day. I've watched kids come in excited to tell how they've stood up to bullies without having to turn to violence or running away. A man who has become a good friend of mine was on the verge of leaving a gym I work at when we had a fitness challenge. His wife made him enter and asked myself and other trainers to push him. Not only did he lose 31 pounds in 3 months, but he won the competition and has become happier and more motivated to get to the gym almost daily.
I also plan to make it a place for the holidays. I want to have thanksgiving dinners and the such for everyone who doesn't have a family, just doesn't want to cook, or just wants to eat.   Risks & Challenges  One of the biggest risk with opening a gym is just getting people to sign up. Even after signing up no matter how affordable a gym may be, people do have other obligations in life that may prevent them from being able to pay on time or at all. I am able to understand what it's like to be in the position to not be able to afford something or to not be able to pay on time. I know from being in a gym that certain months will be busier than others and that people may have to cancel. 
I plan to solve these problems by being affordable number one, but also I plan to work with people and find the best way to adjust so that I can still make a profit, but still keep them as a member. If I have to make a special deal that isn't going to cost the business more than I will be willing to do so. 
Another plan I have is to have personal trainers who are independent contractors. Meaning they would make their own prices and train as many or few clients as they desire or could but, they would have to pay a small monthly fee in order to train clients at the gym. This would be a great way to keep the gym from needing to pay extra for employees while still gaining money and allowing members to have a variety of unique trainers to fit each of of their unique personalities and training needs.   Other Ways You Can Help Maybe you like my plan but cannot afford to make a contribution? Maybe you have fitness gear that you want to donate? Maybe you network with others who can?
I'm asking for help and I will only turn it down from illegal means so, if you are able to help in any way, shape or, form, please do so. Even if the biggest thing you can do would be to share this on social media that may be all it takes for someone who may be able to do a little more to do just that.",2.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>You, the Indiegogo community, have already helped Smith &amp; Wellness get this far, and for that we are truly grateful! Last year we launched our first campaign to raise the capital needed to get us off the ground. Even though we only reached 10% of our goal through online and cash donations, it was enough to purchase the basic bioelectrical instruments we now use daily to educate and inspire our clients towards greater well-being!</p>
<p>This book is important because of the audience that NEEDS our message and are not hearing it anywhere else. Health professionals all have their own niche and way of treating different conditions, but many of them shy away from working with the complexities of the nervous system. If we can teach even the basics about bioelectricity to consumers AND their health professionals, we can finally target the common link that underpins almost every single health issue known. </p>

While it’s an innovative idea, it’s also incredibly simple. In fact, we were surprised no one else had thought of it: <b>keep patients at the center of our mission by keeping them at the center of our business model</b>, and build a market by building a community.

But those investors expect returns, and they want a business plan that’s going to put profits in their pockets. <b>For Hallaway, though, our patients are our priority, and providing them with safe, consistent, affordable medicine is our number one concern.</b> So we thought of a courageous new model for the cannabis industry: <b>let’s skip the investors.</b> Let’s get our funding from our patients and push the profits back to them in the form of deep discounts.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What You Get</b><br/></p><p>We are offering founding memberships to all qualifying campaign donors.

We’re not against the big guy, and we’re excited about the high bar they’ll set for our state’s medical cannabis. But we think there’s room for everyone, and we don’t want small businesses to get squeezed out because they can’t acquire the capital these bigger companies have access to. <b>As a small, local company, funded by patients, we won’t have investors looking for a share of the profits.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Working for Patients Since Day One</b></p>
<p>We have been working day and night to get this dispensary off the ground. In addition to raising funds we have had to: prepare our application, gain support from community leaders and members, secure several appropriate locations, take courses in dispensary management, and the whole time -- keep our day jobs! We've also met some really awesome people along the way. Through networking and fundraising events we've met leaders in our industry as well as politicians, advocates, and of course -- PATIENTS! Beyond our industry we've worked with some really awesome local artists, consultants, and professionals. Two of our founders are the co-chairs for Women Grow: Baltimore, and as far as we can tell -- Hallaway is the only dispensary that is a member of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce.

</div></div>","Our Groundbreaking Campaign We are Hallaway, and we’re asking for your support to open the first ever crowdfunded medical cannabis dispensary in history. While it’s an innovative idea, it’s also incredibly simple. In fact, we were surprised no one else had thought of it: keep patients at the center of our mission by keeping them at the center of our business model, and build a market by building a community. Basically, we want you to feel as invested in us as we feel in creating a healthier, happier Maryland. Hallaway is prelicensure -- this means that we have not yet obtained a license from the MMCC. Our team is working day and night to make sure we obtain a license this fall. Your help on this campaign, will bring us closer to our goal. If we do not win a license, we will not stop with our quest to obtain one.  If you want to watch the application process, follow us on Snapchat (user name in the rewards). 
We are three best friends, with a passion for helping people feel better.What We Need The costs of licensing and building out a medical cannabis dispensary are enormous, and most companies rely on investors to help them get up and running. But those investors expect returns, and they want a business plan that’s going to put profits in their pockets. For Hallaway, though, our patients are our priority, and providing them with safe, consistent, affordable medicine is our number one concern. So we thought of a courageous new model for the cannabis industry: let’s skip the investors. Let’s get our funding from our patients and push the profits back to them in the form of deep discounts.What You GetWe are offering founding memberships to all qualifying campaign donors. This means that, in addition to the product discounts you’ll receive for our entire first year of operation, you’ll forever be a part of the Hallaway community and the Maryland medical cannabis movement. Special VIP privileges for all founding members include patient resources, event invitations, members-only classes, and birthday gifts (free gram of dried flower every year on your birthday-forever!). Bigger donors have the opportunity to display their name or brand on our founders’ wall or a chance to name our patient resource center, which will be stocked with reference materials, a lab-grade microscope, and a lending library of cannabis related literature. This is a great way to show your patients that you care about patient focused cannabis in Maryland.We Answer To YouMost medical cannabis dispensaries get their capital from investors, or from out-of-state businesses that have an interest in Maryland’s market. We’re not against the big guy, and we’re excited about the high bar they’ll set for our state’s medical cannabis. But we think there’s room for everyone, and we don’t want small businesses to get squeezed out because they can’t acquire the capital these bigger companies have access to. As a small, local company, funded by patients, we won’t have investors looking for a share of the profits. We will be able to pass those savings on to you and reinvest in the state of Maryland and the community we share.Do you qualify as a Maryland Patient?Qualifying patients, registered in Maryland have: 
Obtained a recommendation from a certifying doctor in Maryland.
Registered with the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission
You do not have to be a Maryland resident to qualify as a Maryland patient. This means anyone from Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and beyond can obtain a recommendation from a certifying Maryland physician if they have one of the qualifying conditions OR if their certifying Maryland physicians believes medical cannabis would provide relief of their particular condition. If you have any questions about whether or not you qualify, email us at info@hallawaymaryland.com. We’d be glad to provide resources to answer your questions.
Still not sure if you qualify? Check out the Cannabis Commission's Website HERE!
We Are Hallaway
We will always aim to be a model of a responsible, ethical, and diverse business, dedicated to making a positive impact in our neighborhood and our city. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to our community through our relationships with both Habitat for Humanity and the Maryland Food Bank, and we’ve already pledged to donate a portion of our profits each year to the Epilepsy Foundation for the Chesapeake Region. 
Working for Patients Since Day One
We have been working day and night to get this dispensary off the ground. In addition to raising funds we have had to: prepare our application, gain support from community leaders and members, secure several appropriate locations, take courses in dispensary management, and the whole time -- keep our day jobs! We've also met some really awesome people along the way. Through networking and fundraising events we've met leaders in our industry as well as politicians, advocates, and of course -- PATIENTS! Beyond our industry we've worked with some really awesome local artists, consultants, and professionals. Two of our founders are the co-chairs for Women Grow: Baltimore, and as far as we can tell -- Hallaway is the only dispensary that is a member of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce. We have never stopped working to get patient-focused cannabis to Maryland.

I'm begging you.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm in Canada. Yes, we have healthcare. However, Canada's healthcare does NOT cover ANY dental work whatsoever. And it's insanely expensive.</p><p>This is why I so desperately NEED your help! </p><p>I have seen celebrities using this type of means for funding projects of their own, and they have more money than I will ever see in a lifetime. <br/>I am hoping that there will be a few people out there that will help me out by even donating a few dollars... even $5 or $1 helps. <br/><br/>I started this campaign just over a year ago on Go Fund Me. I've managed to raise $430 on there ... I've only posted this on my Twitter up until now ... so now I'm posting it on my Facebook, and face the humiliation because I have no other options left... I'm literally running out of time... I've been told I just might die.<br/><br/>I have been told that I have aggressive stage 1 cervical and a rare vulvar cancer and have to have the dental surgery done before I have that surgery done because when they put me under and intubate me, it will more than likely break off my teeth which will cause more extensive damage to my teeth, gums and jaw, not to mention I risk swallowing them. My dentist, and my oncologist have told me that if this happens, they will not fix it or try to save them if that happens, they'll just do their surgery and have me deal with it with my dentist after... and that will cost much more to fix, plus risk me going septic from infection from it once they fall out. <br/>Left undone, I risk further humiliation of having no teeth at 40, still being unable to eat solid foods, but, going forward with my cancer surgery, I will at least not die being untreated and my daughter only being 8 (who I have NOT told I have cancer as my father, her grandfather, just passed away from it in October, so it scares her to hear the word now) will at least still have her mother alive. My 12 year old knows, and has even donated $25 of her own money she saved up from babysitting!<br/><br/>After FINALLY finding what I thought was an awesome job just over 8 months ago, that actually offers me benefits, it all came crashing down around me when my employer, Target Canada, closed its doors in Canada and I am now finding myself out of work yet again...... and no benefits, yet again. <br/><br/>15 years ago I had all 4 wisdom teeth removed and the dentist screwed up. A reverse retainer was supposed to be put in front top and bottom to avoid spacing of the teeth, and it was not done. Therefore all teeth started spacing out to where the front 2 had a 1/4 inch gap. Over time, due to increasing difficulty in eating because of the spacing and loosening of the teeth, I have become anaemic, and have had significant bone loss so therefore implants are no longer even an option any more.<br/><br/>In order to be able to eat to some degree, my previous dentist offered me a payment plan to have a denture made for me and a partial for the bottom on a payment plan ... he said he could extract the top front 4 because they were so loose it would be fast and simple with local freezing ... and he used a temporary partial plate for the top 4 front teeth. This was able to be done in his office... however, I had to go to a dental surgeon to do the rest of the extractions as they were so extensive. So, we went ahead and did it... <br/>This temporary upper was supposed to be taken out and replaced with the denture within 3 months. <br/><br/>That was 10 years ago. This already took every penny I had. <br/><br/>It took me 3 years to pay him off... I managed over 5 years after that to pay for my top denture to be made and the bottom partial ... I now have those... however, this gets worse........... I tried to set up the appointment with the surgeon................ tried.<br/><br/>An appointment was finally made 2 years ago for the extractions, and the night before, got a call from the dental surgeon's secretary to go over all the do's and don'ts like don't eat after midnight etc... and was told to make sure to have the full $5800 for the extractions ready by cash, credit card or money order before the surgery, including the $800 for the anaesthesiologist. I was in shock. This wasn't the plan! This wasn't what was discussed! I was living in daily pain and they promised to HELP ME!<br/><br/>The initial consultation was horrific, but he was the only surgeon in the area that I could call. I was humiliated, judged, and left in tears. I got the appointment booked, but not without walking out feeling less than 2 feet tall. <br/><br/>During my consultation, we included discussing a payment plan option. Feeling the way I did, I still agreed because he was willing to do a payment plan. <br/>When I received the phone call the night before the surgery, apparently the payment plan option was no longer an option.<br/><br/>They said sorry, that option isn't available and we don't know why it was even discussed with you. I was told flat out that ""You have 15 minutes to decide how and if the payment will be made or we're cancelling the appointment. If you can't pay it upfront, then we will have to give the appointment to someone else."" <br/><br/>The appointment was cancelled and they hung up on me when I started to cry and tell them I couldn't live in pain like this any more. They didn't care.<br/>After searching for a good dentist that would do the extractions for me, not judge me, or make me feel bad, I haven't been able to find one. I did find one that said he could help, however, again, we're now looking at extensive costs because of how long this has been left. He did an updated x-ray for me... I have only 1 molar left in tact in the top right of my mouth.<br/><br/>My current dentist is trying very hard to work with me on the costs, but, unfortunately, he needs to be paid as well, and so does the anesthesiologist. <br/>He has said that because I need thousands of dollars worth of work done to correct these problems, and now, the surgery time is tripled because of how much he needs to cut into my gums to literally dig out every broken piece left below the gum line, the cost has now increased as well. He said the bottom plate that I paid for, is now useless, and I have to have a whole new denture made for the bottom. I can't afford that again. That's yet another $3000 I now have to dish out.<br/><br/>I have been told that because of the state of my bottom teeth, I can not have an impression made of the teeth to have a denture made to put in when the extraction happens... I have to wait for the gums to heal and then have one made to fit the top one I currently have. So, I will have no bottom teeth at all until I can afford a denture to be made.<br/><br/>The cost is absolutely out of my mind's comprehension to be able to even save for at this point... I have no job now, but am looking like crazy for another one that offers benefits. Which means putting it off again for a few more months until I find another job and benefits kick in, and then take more time off work from a new job...<br/><br/>The next appointment was supposed to be June 10th. My birthday. Yay. Not how I wanted to spend it, but I have no choice. If I don't have the money up front for the anaesthesiologist at the very least, they will NOT do the surgery.<br/><br/>This appointment ended up being cancelled because the cost for the anaesthesiologist went from $700 quoted to $2700!!! HOW!? I don't know. But, he said if I don't have it, too bad, he doesn't care about my situation, or who I am, he will not do it. Nice huh?<br/><br/>I made one last ditch effort to contact The University of Toronto Oral Surgery department last week - AND GOT IN!!! I had my consultation and they can do the work!!!<br/><br/>I had an AMAZING consultation with one of the Dental Professors and they are going to get all the work done for me at a lesser cost! <br/>THEY WANT TO HELP! <br/><br/>My original dentist was going to charge me $8900 for all extractions and anaesthesiologist NOT including pre-op visit, post-op visit, or taxes!<br/><br/>For The U of T surgery - $5800 for ALL! Extractions, pre-op, post-op, anaesthesiologist AND TAXES INCLUDED!<br/><br/>Due to the severity of my situation, they're giving me a PRACTICING DENTIST that has come back to finish their Oral Surgery Degree and that is a GRADUATE of the course!!!<br/><br/>I am SOOOO beyond excited!!! <br/><br/>Appointment is booked for August 26th at 8:30 am<br/><br/>PLEASE share and help me reach my goal!<br/><br/>I NEED THIS DONE!<br/><br/>Again, I am putting myself out there, humbling myself, and embarrassing myself to show the world what a sad state I am in, to see if I can get some help from kind hearted strangers... <br/><br/>Every donation helps.</p></div>","I am putting myself out there, humbling myself, and embarrassing myself to see if I can get some help from kind hearted strangers... please read this to the end ...

My dentist, and my oncologist have told me that if this happens, they will not fix it or try to save them if that happens, they'll just do their surgery and have me deal with it with my dentist after... and that will cost much more to fix, plus risk me going septic from infection from it once they fall out. Left undone, I risk further humiliation of having no teeth at 40, still being unable to eat solid foods, but, going forward with my cancer surgery, I will at least not die being untreated and my daughter only being 8 (who I have NOT told I have cancer as my father, her grandfather, just passed away from it in October, so it scares her to hear the word now) will at least still have her mother alive. My 12 year old knows, and has even donated $25 of her own money she saved up from babysitting!After FINALLY finding what I thought was an awesome job just over 8 months ago, that actually offers me benefits, it all came crashing down around me when my employer, Target Canada, closed its doors in Canada and I am now finding myself out of work yet again...... and no benefits, yet again. 15 years ago I had all 4 wisdom teeth removed and the dentist screwed up. A reverse retainer was supposed to be put in front top and bottom to avoid spacing of the teeth, and it was not done. Therefore all teeth started spacing out to where the front 2 had a 1/4 inch gap. Over time, due to increasing difficulty in eating because of the spacing and loosening of the teeth, I have become anaemic, and have had significant bone loss so therefore implants are no longer even an option any more.In order to be able to eat to some degree, my previous dentist offered me a payment plan to have a denture made for me and a partial for the bottom on a payment plan ... he said he could extract the top front 4 because they were so loose it would be fast and simple with local freezing ... and he used a temporary partial plate for the top 4 front teeth. This was able to be done in his office... however, I had to go to a dental surgeon to do the rest of the extractions as they were so extensive. So, we went ahead and did it... This temporary upper was supposed to be taken out and replaced with the denture within 3 months. That was 10 years ago. This already took every penny I had. It took me 3 years to pay him off... I managed over 5 years after that to pay for my top denture to be made and the bottom partial ... I now have those... however, this gets worse........... I tried to set up the appointment with the surgeon................ tried.An appointment was finally made 2 years ago for the extractions, and the night before, got a call from the dental surgeon's secretary to go over all the do's and don'ts like don't eat after midnight etc... and was told to make sure to have the full $5800 for the extractions ready by cash, credit card or money order before the surgery, including the $800 for the anaesthesiologist. I was in shock. This wasn't the plan! This wasn't what was discussed! I was living in daily pain and they promised to HELP ME!The initial consultation was horrific, but he was the only surgeon in the area that I could call. I was humiliated, judged, and left in tears. I got the appointment booked, but not without walking out feeling less than 2 feet tall. During my consultation, we included discussing a payment plan option. Feeling the way I did, I still agreed because he was willing to do a payment plan. When I received the phone call the night before the surgery, apparently the payment plan option was no longer an option.They said sorry, that option isn't available and we don't know why it was even discussed with you. I was told flat out that ""You have 15 minutes to decide how and if the payment will be made or we're cancelling the appointment. If you can't pay it upfront, then we will have to give the appointment to someone else."" The appointment was cancelled and they hung up on me when I started to cry and tell them I couldn't live in pain like this any more. They didn't care.After searching for a good dentist that would do the extractions for me, not judge me, or make me feel bad, I haven't been able to find one. I did find one that said he could help, however, again, we're now looking at extensive costs because of how long this has been left. He did an updated x-ray for me... I have only 1 molar left in tact in the top right of my mouth.My current dentist is trying very hard to work with me on the costs, but, unfortunately, he needs to be paid as well, and so does the anesthesiologist. He has said that because I need thousands of dollars worth of work done to correct these problems, and now, the surgery time is tripled because of how much he needs to cut into my gums to literally dig out every broken piece left below the gum line, the cost has now increased as well. He said the bottom plate that I paid for, is now useless, and I have to have a whole new denture made for the bottom. I can't afford that again. That's yet another $3000 I now have to dish out.I have been told that because of the state of my bottom teeth, I can not have an impression made of the teeth to have a denture made to put in when the extraction happens... I have to wait for the gums to heal and then have one made to fit the top one I currently have. So, I will have no bottom teeth at all until I can afford a denture to be made.The cost is absolutely out of my mind's comprehension to be able to even save for at this point... I have no job now, but am looking like crazy for another one that offers benefits. Which means putting it off again for a few more months until I find another job and benefits kick in, and then take more time off work from a new job...The next appointment was supposed to be June 10th. My birthday. Yay. Not how I wanted to spend it, but I have no choice. If I don't have the money up front for the anaesthesiologist at the very least, they will NOT do the surgery.This appointment ended up being cancelled because the cost for the anaesthesiologist went from $700 quoted to $2700!!! HOW!? I don't know. But, he said if I don't have it, too bad, he doesn't care about my situation, or who I am, he will not do it. Nice huh?I made one last ditch effort to contact The University of Toronto Oral Surgery department last week - AND GOT IN!!! I had my consultation and they can do the work!!!I had an AMAZING consultation with one of the Dental Professors and they are going to get all the work done for me at a lesser cost! THEY WANT TO HELP! My original dentist was going to charge me $8900 for all extractions and anaesthesiologist NOT including pre-op visit, post-op visit, or taxes!For The U of T surgery - $5800 for ALL! Extractions, pre-op, post-op, anaesthesiologist AND TAXES INCLUDED!Due to the severity of my situation, they're giving me a PRACTICING DENTIST that has come back to finish their Oral Surgery Degree and that is a GRADUATE of the course!!!I am SOOOO beyond excited!!! Appointment is booked for August 26th at 8:30 amPLEASE share and help me reach my goal!I NEED THIS DONE!Again, I am putting myself out there, humbling myself, and embarrassing myself to show the world what a sad state I am in, to see if I can get some help from kind hearted strangers...

<p><b>Quick Summary:</b></p>
<p>Health discovery by safe and radiation-free screening
using advanced infrared technology will enable the detection of any
inflammation and potential cancerous activity at an early stage, and the
follow-up dietary based treatment options would potentially save many lives as
well as billions of dollars on healthcare expenditures for chronic diseases.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The
problem:</b></p>
<p>Modern life is full of stress the vast majority of
which is psychological - work, finances, families, and their competing
demands.
Stress activates a sympathetic response (also known as “fight or flight"" response) in our
body which is useful when we really need it. But when it's happening at a
low grade all the time in response to the chronic stress, our body can, over
time, take a profound physical toll. Organs are fatigued and not functioning properly, and the body
is constantly in a state of inflammation, creating the environment for
<span>degenerative diseases. </span></p>
<p>Research indicates that chronic inflammation and stress are the big players in the age
related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and brain deterioration. The problem is that
the traditional medical intervention is evidence based. That is, the disease
has to be mature enough for diagnosis by traditional diagnostic tools. This is a
reactive approach- it costs more and saves less lives. We need a safe,
effective and less expansive option for chronic diseases, that is prevention and early intervention! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is Health Discovery?</b></p>
<p>Health discovery is a process of
preventive health screening by using an advanced infrared technology that is 100%
safe and is uniquely able to detect any inflammation and potential
cancerous activity at an early stage. Our body emits
infrared radiation which is essentially heat produced by vascular activity and
metabolic reactions, and this heat pattern is remotely detected by infrared
technology. Moreover, this screening (also known as tele-thermography or infrared
thermography) is the gold standard for documenting sympathetic response and thus an ideal tool
for discovering chronic inflammation in the body.Thermography
does not replace any modality, it simply provides a safe and sensitive
alternative. The true value of thermography lies in the fact that it gives you the
opportunity for early intervention, before the potential development and growth of a chronic, life threatening
disease. The nice thing is, that it is a non-invasive, radiation-free
&amp; touch-free procedure! </p>

a disease that takes years to grow to the stage it can be detected by
traditional screening modalities. Detection by mammography and other
traditional modalities depend on the size and density of the tumor, and by the
time a tumor is detected by traditional X-Ray mammography, the body has over a

effective in detecting benign versus malignant abnormalities. The earlier
a disease is diagnosed, the more likely it is to cure or effectively manage it

The most common test
used to detect level of inflammation in the blood stream is called C-reactive
protein (CRP). It is a simple and inexpensive test, however, it is
non-specific; that is, it simply detects inflammation from all sources,
including medications or injuries. For this reason, it cannot always be used to
measure chronic inflammation concerning cardiovascular disease. This is another
area where Thermography can be very helpful since it can show
the inflammation in the peripheral arteries leading to the heart and/or redirection

early warning indicators for a developing heart disease. </p></li>

<p>The Wingman Harness was designed by
Dr. Chris Spinelli for his daughter.<span>  His
daughter experiences mobility issues which her twin brother does not have.  When she was a youngster she had functional
needs which were not addressed in traditional therapy.  Fortunately, Chris is both a pediatric physician
and a military officer.  He does not back
down from a challenge easily, got out his sewing kit and started building the
harness.  Chris continued to improve the design and sew new
harnesses.  Driven by his passion as a
father and his unique expertise in both pediatric medicine and parachute
webbing the Wingman Harness was born. </span></p>

<p>Chris and his family took the
harness to a large Children’s Hospital in the Midwest.<span>  The hospital encouraged the Spinelli’s to
make more harnesses and get them on the market so other folks could benefit.  While encouraging, this has proven to be a tough process due to
limited resources and a lack of a distribution network.  Through trade shows the harness has reached a
few hundred therapists as well as a few flagship hospitals. To gain wider awareness
and adoption, Wingman needs FDA approval; this will make it eligible for insurance
reimbursement, thus making it more affordable for many users.  This approval process is
long, expensive and frankly difficult, but your help can get us over the
hump!  The harness is made in the USA by
a specialty manufacture with expertise in parachute harnesses and military webbing.
This is certainly not the cheapest way
to build it, but quality is important and we think this is the best. </span></p>

<p><b>Does Wingman Actually Work? </b></p>
<p>YES!<span>  In addition to Chris’ daughter who is doing
much better, the harness has been the subject of two clinical trials.  The results of the first trial were published
in the most recent winter edition of the Pediatric Physical Therapy magazine.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why are there only two sizes?<span>  </span></b></p>
<p>Wingman is designed to be adjustable allowing the Child
version to fit kids 2+ years of age to puberty, and the Adult version to fit
individuals from puberty to adult sizes.  It is adjustable around G-Tubes,
pacemakers, or central line ports.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Does Wingman Benefit the Caregiver as well? </b></p>
<p>YES!<span> 
Wingman’s impact is also felt by the person helping the person wearing
it.  
Caregivers have told us they experience less back pain due to the ergonomic
nature of the device and the custom fit to the person wearing it.  </span></p>

am a Wingman” or “I love my Wingman”. 
· 
$150, Give a
Wingman to charity!  You can select to
give a Wingman to a child through Camp Independence.  Or, you can elect the Wounded Warrior Project
and give one to an injured veteran.  Either
way you will be a hero to us and to the person whose life you impact.
· 
$175, Get a Wingman!  If
you have a loved one who could use the Wingman, or you are therapy provider,
get a Wingman for less than the normal cost, and play an important role in
helping us achieve the goal of better affordability and wider adoption.  
· 
$250, Get the Deluxe Harness System. This system includes the Wingman
Harness, the ceiling strap, chest strap, and leg strap.  These extras combined with the harness give
you the greatest flexibility and opportunity to use the harness in the most
diverse and effective ways.  The kit is
great for therapist or home use. 



Does Wingman Actually Work? 
YES!  In addition to Chris’ daughter who is doing
much better, the harness has been the subject of two clinical trials.  The results of the first trial were published
in the most recent winter edition of the Pediatric Physical Therapy magazine.  

Why are there only two sizes?  
Wingman is designed to be adjustable allowing the Child
version to fit kids 2+ years of age to puberty, and the Adult version to fit
individuals from puberty to adult sizes.  It is adjustable around G-Tubes,
pacemakers, or central line ports.  

Does Wingman Benefit the Caregiver as well? 
YES! 
Wingman’s impact is also felt by the person helping the person wearing
it.  
Caregivers have told us they experience less back pain due to the ergonomic
nature of the device and the custom fit to the person wearing it.  
THANK YOU for your support of
Wingman and this crowdfunding campaign!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>My name is Gladstone
Etienne, Founder of ZABICOLife.  Just a little background on myself, I
grew up in the Caribbean, using herbs as a part of my daily life.  I later went into pursuits of education in
finance and herbalism. I am very passionate about herbs and how they
promote healthy living, and I want to share the health benefits.   I have
developed all natural organic herbal blends, which support detoxing, lower blood
pressure, strengthening the heart muscle and rhythm, and women’s health issues
including, fibroids, and hormonal balance support.  As more people are
exploring alternative methods of healing ZABICOLife would like to be at the
forefront of such efforts by providing products that support health.  Your
contribution will allow my company to make these awesome herbal blends
available to the public at large. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am seeking $10,000
in funding. This funding will enable me to complete packaging, marketing,
website development, and inventory.  These funds will be used solely for
business matters.  I have already begun selling on a small scale to family
members, friends, and associates; however, I would like to present these
awesome herbal blends to a larger clientele on a higher platform. This is very
exciting as my desire is to see people living in optimum health.  I am
willing to offer herbal samples as my unique perks to contributors. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Your contribution will
allow me to bring years of passion to the forefront.  I grew up using an
abundance of herbs for many different ailments. I rarely visited the doctor as
a child as my parents administered herbs for such things as; stomach aches,
detoxing, sprains, skin issues, headaches, etc.  Many people have
experienced improvement from my 7 Day Herbal Cleanse.  Herbs shouldn’t be
a substitute for conventional health; however, the use of herbs helps to
support and improve overall health conditions and sustainment of quality of
life. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am not a medical
doctor, nor do I claim to be one.  I am simply sharing the benefits that I
have seen in my life, and the life of others by embracing the healing benefits
of herbs.  The more people are educated on the use of herbs, the more they
will be inclined to include herbs as a part of their lifestyle. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div><p></p><p></p><p>If you would like to
contribute but are not able at this time, please spread the word. It’s like
when you receive good news, or good information. You can’t keep it to yourself,
you have to share.  I view ZABICOLife as a good thing that could help someone
you know. </p>

WHY BBOYULTIMATUM SUPPORTS CANCER RESEARCH?
During building this campaign founder ""WESTROK"" received a call that his friend and fellow member of the ALL PRO BBOY Dance family, Tim ""DJ TIMBUK2"" Jones  passed from cancer.  TIMBUK was a world famous DJ from Chicago and an inspirational person.  The campaign immediately shifted to honor a brother that gave so much of himself.  A week later another friend died of brain cancer.  We will honor all friends and family that have been affected by cancer, with love, passion and support for the those who are presently fighting.  Portions of our years profit will go toward the American Cancer Society.  We trust that this the right thing to do, so we are starting now!  15% we will be given to The ACS at the end of our campaign.   Checkout our AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY page herebit.ly/FNTD-2016-ACSITS NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY, WE ARE ALSO GIVING OURSELVES...BboyUltimatum is organizing volunteer to work directly with groups and individuals facing this challenge.  Inspiring with good music, dance, and maybe just be a good friend to have support.  Break Dancing is based on creative energy, through focus, discipline and just bringing an atmosphere of fun! (To join our volunteer team please email me at BboyUltimatum@GMAIL.COM)

SO WHAT IS BBOYULTIMATUM'S  FRIDAY NIGHT THROW DOWN?

WHY HAVE WE HOSTED FNTD COMPETITIONS YEAR AFTER YEAR?

BboyUltimatum is a leader
in producing Break-dance events.  The past 4
years we have supported our community of highly skilled and talented pro/am
Breakers (generally age’s 14-28 female & male) with an organized, trusted
platform, and network. 
BBU offers a structured event to passionate, dedicated, artist/athletes. With
support from the breaking community and spectators, year after year we have hosted FNTD, with free workshops/classes, and even sponsoring individual Break-dancers. FNTD is for the community by the community.
WHY ARE WE SO COMMITTED TO PRO BREAK-DANCING?
BboyUltimatum is part of a greater global
movement. The 2016 FNTD is an opportunity to expand worldwide, offering a platform to Break-dance athletes to display the power of positive Hip Hop artistry.  2016 FNTD  is a major step toward our
cultures first developing pro sport.  When a Break Dancer shines the entire community is empowered.  The inspiration and hope
young individuals gain from FNTD events is exponential.  We are building self-esteem,
and discipline in a positive organized environment for at-risk youth, and spreading the word about health awareness.  Those who envision professional recognition, consistently train, focus on
innovating style, and are passionate will have the opportunity to
compete on a global level.  We are
committed to offering this opportunity. ""We want to express our highest gratitude to Bboyultimatum for taking there precious time out to venture in Belize exploring and promoting Break Dance to the fullest.  We are sure that the Bboy battle event meant something great to all the young men that participated""Boldcoms, Community OrganizationBelize City, Belize
HOW DOES FNTD  COMPETITION WORK?? 
Break Dancing is a globe community, and BBU has traveled worldwide hosting FNTD .  BBU, FNTD morphed from small live street competition to major auditoriums with numerous spectators and
international judges.  The FNTD is
a tournament style, 1-on-1 competition
highlighting exceptional practitioners of this skill, viewed globally, via live-stream.  We partnered
with Qinetic Live which specializes in high quality streaming for pro sports
events. They are committed to coverage of the FNTD with a full camera crew, and production team at

OUR VISION ENCOMPASSES PHILANTHROPIC INITIATIVES.
Every event is introduced with FREE workshops, classes, and seminars, sponsored by BBU.  Break dancers, judges, and officials, volunteer their time to teach spectators, fans, and novice
Break-dancers the history, training methods, and philosophy which they practice
to master this skill.  The audience can engage and understand Break-dancing from a practical point.  We are expanding these volunteer efforts to a community being faced by the challenge of cancer, and help spread information about preventive tools based on health, wellness, and dance.
HOW DID BBOYULTIMATUM'S FRIDAY NIGHT THROW DOWN START?
Founder Jameel “WESTROK” Coleman has over 25 year of Break-dance experience and seen the development of Breaking
culture grow from an underground level to a global phenomenon.  As a seasoned entrepreneur in Break-dance promotions
he’s dealt with organizations that only wanted watered down Break dance, gymnastic,
or acrobatic events.  WESTROK has committed
his life to developing a series of authentic, professionally organized competitions,
which represent our culture as a whole.  BBU is building foundation for a professional Break-Dance industry that will allow artist/athletes to compete regularly as respected,
career, competitors. 

How your money will be spent.

Leading Edge Technology Offers a Solution

TRAZER is a “movement simulator” offering the first and only concussion baseline assessment that actually replicates the interactivity, spontaneity and functional movement demands of sport. By challenging the senses, mind and body, TRAZER recreates the physical demands actually faced by your athlete on the field or court.

TRAZER measures what is invisible to the naked eye, and generates objective reports that show your athlete’s global performance capabilities.
The New York Times recently commented on the predictive value of the NFL Combine, “An analysis by the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective confirms that a track meet in February is of limited use for people trying to figure out how well people will play football in November…Any exercise involving a cone does not seem to matter much.”
By contrast, TRAZER’s randomized cues elicit realistic movement responses that allow us to measure such elusive and sport specific parameters as reaction time, first step quickness and stopping power.

<p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Dr. Hummel grew up in a small Arizona community where he
developed a love for herbal medicines and natural health therapies. The first
science project he ever completed was a survey of local edible herbs while in
2nd grade. Other than a multitude of life experiences Dr. Hummel's formal
education began with the completion of an Associate’s Degree in Science with
Honors at Yavapai Community College. His high academic performance earned him
an award signed by the governor of Arizona which provided him full tuition to
any of the three major Arizona universities. A few years later he graduated
from Northern Arizona University with a dual major in Biology and Chemistry.
During that time Dr. Hummel spent several years shadowing physicians and volunteering
at various clinics and hospitals in order to fulfill his dream to become a
general practice physician. Upon graduation, he entered into a mainstream
medical school but soon realized his personal desires to become a holistic
physician were not being met. He then spent a year in a Chiropractic
program where he learned about and felt a strong call towards the profession of
Naturopathic Medicine. Dr. Hummel went on to graduate from the Southwest College
of Naturopathic Medicine (a four year accredited naturopathic medical school)
as a Naturopathic Medical Doctor. During that time, he spent a considerable
amount of focused training in botanical medicine studies specifically taking
various extracurricular courses, attending multiple seminars, and completing
numerous clinical shifts focused on botanical medicine. He is now currently
completing a CNME/NPGA-approved general practice residency at Cameron Wellness
Center with Dr. Todd Cameron, NMD.  </p>Dr. Hummel created The Bountiful Herbs Botanical Medicine Database for professionals while
attending medical school. He noticed that even experts in the field often
needed to reference the safety and characteristics of individual herbs but that
nothing currently existed that allowed practitioners to create individualized,
safe, and effective formulas in a timely manner. He then spent 2 years in
conjunction with other experts and programmers creating the first version of
the program. Dr. Hummel believes whole-heartedly in the power of botanical
medicine and is passionate about making herbal medicine a simple option for everybody to explore. <br/>

an award signed by the governor of Arizona which provided him full tuition to
any of the three major Arizona universities. A few years later he graduated
from Northern Arizona University with a dual major in Biology and Chemistry.
During that time Dr. Hummel spent several years shadowing physicians and volunteering
at various clinics and hospitals in order to fulfill his dream to become a
general practice physician. Upon graduation, he entered into a mainstream
medical school but soon realized his personal desires to become a holistic
physician were not being met. He then spent a year in a Chiropractic
program where he learned about and felt a strong call towards the profession of
Naturopathic Medicine. Dr. Hummel went on to graduate from the Southwest College
of Naturopathic Medicine (a four year accredited naturopathic medical school)
as a Naturopathic Medical Doctor. During that time, he spent a considerable
amount of focused training in botanical medicine studies specifically taking
various extracurricular courses, attending multiple seminars, and completing
numerous clinical shifts focused on botanical medicine. He is now currently
completing a CNME/NPGA-approved general practice residency at Cameron Wellness
Center with Dr. Todd Cameron, NMD.  Dr. Hummel created The Bountiful Herbs Botanical Medicine Database for professionals while
attending medical school. He noticed that even experts in the field often
needed to reference the safety and characteristics of individual herbs but that
nothing currently existed that allowed practitioners to create individualized,
safe, and effective formulas in a timely manner. He then spent 2 years in
conjunction with other experts and programmers creating the first version of
the program. Dr. Hummel believes whole-heartedly in the power of botanical
medicine and is passionate about making herbal medicine a simple option for everybody to explore.

<h3>Stack Labs Inc</h3>
<p>Originally founded in 2013 to create a new type of responsive light bulb, Stack Labs was working on occupancy and spatial awareness from the very beginning.  Early on, the seeds of an idea were there as Stack’s Data Scientist realized that the embedded motion detection could offer a much different product.</p>
<p>Lighting studies running circadian patterns in retirement communities offered an ideal opportunity to start collecting and validating data.</p>
<p>In September 2017, Stack divested the lighting hardware side of the business and a few of us with aging parents and grandparents decided that we should attempt to build a product that would give us some daily insight into how our loved ones’ are doing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579551053/dgfqx2tgvwxfvtnzwvle.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Less than a year later StackCare was born and we started to implement a professional version for retirement communities. Over 18 months Stack built up working relationships with a number of communities from California to Vancouver to Tennessee to Toronto and points in between.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579552316/nsoaljifrv6xyiyafrec.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So many people have been requesting an at-home version of StackCare that we decided this was a must! Now in January 2020 'StackCare @home’ is being launched online to friends and family. </p>
<p>Production has started. Nationwide deployment is planned for 2020.</p>
<h3>What StackCare does...</h3>
<p>Data science algorithms constantly search for anomalies and atypical occurrences or events and when something is spotted the notification platform issues an alert back to the specific account holder.</p>
<p>This all happens in a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>StackCare then continuously learns and adjusts for each individual resident over time. This helps maintain accuracy as behaviors change as residents age or change their routines.</p>
<h3>Worrying About Your Parent</h3>
<p>Independence and dignity are important to seniors. But anyone with a parent living alone understands the daily anxiety and stress of worrying whether Mom, or Dad(!), is OK. StackCare can be the perfect solution waiting for both of you!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579552449/ajay86c7vohsqadknuis.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>StackCare is designed to allow your aging loved one to live in their own home as long as possible without being intrusive or cumbersome. All of the motion data is protected, only you control the app and we designed it so that you can add other family members, caregivers or the resident themselves. </p>
<p>There are no cameras, no microphones, nothing to wear and no batteries to recharge. The system is designed for self-install and is so easy we've had a number of seniors installing it themselves; no-one will be calling or showing up at the door.</p>
<h3>Smart Solutions</h3>
<p>StackCare uses discrete motion sensors and artificial intelligence to learn individual behavior and activity patterns, sending notifications directly to your phone. A fall alert pendant or box is a great idea but it can only react when something catastrophic happens or when your loved presses that button; StackCare doesn't replace that but offers so much more...</p>
<p>With StackCare you get to see at a glance, simply and easily, if your loved one is sleeping ok, is visiting the bathroom too often, whether his/her activity patterns have changed, or even seeing the house temperature to make sure everything is set for the ideal climate.</p>
<h3>Easy to Use</h3>
<p>StackCare’s easy to use app will give you the information to know if everything looks normal or if maybe you need to check in on him/her. Mom/Dad keeps their independence, you get peace of mind.</p>
<h3>No Tools Required!</h3>
<p>Download the app. Plug in the hub. Install the sensors. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>Whether for StackCare @home or with our retirement community product for professional managers and caregivers, we use the same high quality sensors made by NYCE Sensors Inc in Canada. Stack tunes the sensors so they give us rich motion data when someone’s home and then preserve their battery life by ‘sleeping’ when they sense that there’s nobody there. The sensors have a built in thermometer to also provide room temperatures helping you to make sure that Mom or Dad are turning on the AC when they need it.</p>
<p><strong>The Gateway</strong></p>
<p>The Gateway is really just a coordinator for ‘talking’ to the sensors, it collects motion data 24/7 and sends it back to the Stack Cloud. We don’t identify individuals, protecting your loved ones’ privacy, so we just analyze movements within the household based on a unique number identifier for each Gateway.</p>

<p>Oh, and good things come in small packages; the Gateway is only 4”x4” square (that’s 11cmx11cm for our friends in Canada) so it won’t be obtrusive or take up much room.</p>

How StackCare Works...


 

StackCare Hardware
Three discrete sensors to collect motion data combine with a gateway which connects to your wiFi and sends data to the Stack Cloud.  
The Sensors

Whether for StackCare @home or with our retirement community product for professional managers and caregivers, we use the same high quality sensors made by NYCE Sensors Inc in Canada. Stack tunes the sensors so they give us rich motion data when someone’s home and then preserve their battery life by ‘sleeping’ when they sense that there’s nobody there.

We don’t identify individuals, protecting your loved ones’ privacy, so we just analyze movements within the household based on a unique number identifier for each Gateway.

Oh, and good things come in small packages; the Gateway is only 4”x4” square (that’s 11cmx11cm for our friends in Canada) so it won’t be obtrusive or take up much room.

<p><strong>Super Smart Stick </strong>and <strong>Big Kitty Labs</strong> – the perfect partners</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HIT, llc searched high and low for the perfect partner to help us realize the benefits of pairing the S3 with our sensor platform and providing the best Mobile app experience we could design. We found the perfect partner with Big Kitty Labs, Columbus, OH. Dan Rockwell, CEO and Tushar Kulkarni, Co-founders of Big Kitty Labs, have been instrumental in the design and development of our companion Mobile app.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their expertise and guidance has helped us move quickly and focus on early validation and testing, targeting the release of our MVP later this year. As we continue to add user centered features and value, their team provides the skill set and value to evolve and refine our Mobile app road map and bring our users a delightful experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The S3 App aims to provide a platform for coaching and guided progress to assure safe, beneficial daily use of the S3 for a variety of applications. The S3 coaching content is designed to be specific enough to address the needs of our users, easy to access content and assess progress. Further, the platform will provide care partners of all varieties, a one-to-one connection with their constituents in the future, allowing professional evaluation, as users progress through various therapies.</p>
<p><strong>THE SUPER SMART STICK.............FOR THE PROFESSIONALS</strong></p>
<p><strong>To the Professionals!</strong></p>
<p>The demands of higher workloads and documentation standards coupled with lower reimbursements (PDGM) makes day to day operations for health care professional extremely challenging. Trying to balance the demands of caseload and documentation, while also trying to maintain a high standard of patient care, can lead to high degrees of clinician burnout and declining patient outcomes and employee satisfaction.</p>
<p>The <strong>Super Smart Stick </strong>was designed to address issues that healthcare professionals are facing such as <strong>Work Flow Efficiency, improving patient outcomes, and collecting data digitally.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Super Smart Stick </strong>was designed with the vision in mind of <strong>benefitting all </strong>brands of therapy: Home Health, Sports Medicine, Chiropractic, Sports Performance and Wellness.</p>
<h3>Work Flow Efficiency</h3>

<p> </p>
<p>Indeed, the S3 is not just another wellness device, but a platform for health, healing and wellness that anyone can benefit from.</p>
<h2>Stage 2</h2>
<p>We are running stage 1 &amp; 2 simultaneously. We did not want to ask for too much support to start with from the Indiegogo community. As we speak we are calculating our Beta Production.  Our aim with our Beta launch is to get our devices into the hands of 10 lucky people.  With that hand off, we will gather important information.  We want to know the in's and out's of what people think about our design, routines and app.</p>
<p>This information will help us tweak any necessary issues before launching <strong>The Super Smart Stick </strong>to the world.</p>
<p>By running these two Stages simultaneously, We want to ensure that we keep our launch date of September 2020 accurate. Equipped with all the whistles and bells that we are promising.  Everything about our device <strong>The Super Smart Stick </strong> will be tried, tested and confirmed.</p>

<p>One of our most important partners is the Engineering department at Youngstown State University. On February 13th, Rick Eberts and I went to introduce the <strong>Super Smart Stick</strong> to the Engineering Students at YSU.  The purpose of our visit was to introduce the <strong>Super Smart Stick </strong>as a project for the students to use. Their mission is to stress test, design test and software test our product.  To determine the possible weakness and liabilities of the <strong>Super Smart Stick</strong> and provide us with recommendations to improve our device before it hits the market.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">This step is extremely important! We are not only doing a beta launch to determine the pitfalls and use the recommendations to improve our device, we have taken it one step further! We have  a University Engineering department test the device for defects.

<p>I was born on Friday the 13th in September of 1963. I was born with neo-natal hepatitis. I was jaundice and had orange hair. They did exploratory surgery where I had 13 stitches. The doctor told my mother to take me to the priest to get my last rights read to me. So she did. I had my last rights read to me when I was 3 months old. My mother took me and prayed to Saint Anthony.</p>
<p>So here I am at 56 married for 32 years and have had 4 young adults.<br/><strong>SO I BEAT THE ODDS!</strong></p>
<p>I grew up in Youngstown Ohio my father Dr. John H.O. Bleacher was the first pediatric surgeon in our community. So my Father was a local legend here in Youngstown. Being the only pediatric surgeon he operated on in the area. It’s Great to hear, Oh your Dr. Bleacher’s Son?! You’re dad was a Great Man and a Great surgeon... those hands he had such big hands and he operated on those little babies. And then they would proceed to tell me how their Son or daughter are in their 30’s with careers and kids and they are so so grateful. So our family has big shoes to fill.</p>
<p>Growing up I was a swimmer. What a Great way to learn discipline, hard work and that your efforts directly affect the outcome. I had a big passion for swimming and being 5’91/2” I was no Michael Phelps but the passion gave me the inspiration to try out for the University of Cincinnati swim team when Frank Busch was coach in the 80’s.</p>
<p>So where I’m going with this is that I have good grounding. I was able to walk on the UC Bearcats and be on the team and then my second year the team nominated me for captain.<br/><strong>SO I BEAT THE ODDS!</strong></p>
<p>After graduating from UC with honors in a BA in Marketing and Communication I soon moved to the U. K.  I joined the hospitality trade in the U.K. with Scottish and Newcastle Retail where I successfully led 5 units from failure to roaring success. I was showcased on the SKY Pub Channel to attract professional managers to operate units. I drove the Newly formed Barras brand by being on the Food Steering group where my idea for making “The Best of Barras”featured our most popular food items with the best margin in the center of a three folded Menu. It made the company Millions of Sterling. I then moved into marketing supporting the growth of 135 John Barbra’s units and 250 Hybrid units with marketing activities, incentives and kudos to our successful managers. Strategically supporting the growth of our business until we sold our multiple units to the Spirit group in the U.K. <strong>SO I BEAT THE ODDS!</strong></p>
<p>We decided to move back to America to start new adventures. We relocated back to Youngstown to be close to my side of the family. We’ve been back here 7 years and we are looking to continue our successful streak.</p>
<p>At present I am co-owner &amp; heading a start up called Legacy Christian Home Care. A non medical home care agency and just tucked a successful year under our belt.<br/><strong>SO I BEAT THE ODDS!</strong></p>
<p>I am also co-owner of Health Intrinsic Technology (H.I.T.) the mother ship of the Super Smart Stick where we are looking to launch our amazing state of the art device to help people and professionals enhance their lives.<br/>So please help us <strong>BEAT THE ODDS!</strong></p>

<p>I'm a graduate of The Ohio State University and bring 22 years of product design and development experience, in corporate and consulting design, to the HIT team. As Chief Design Officer my focus is to fuel the purposeful, passionate development of HIT products, packaging and branding, with innovative, user-centered processes, resulting in superior outcomes. The Super Smart Stick (S3) is the first of our efforts.</p>
<p>I have also been impacted by severe lower back pain, due to injury, and sought many solutions to my condition. The development of the S3, in a very personal way, was an opportunity to leverage my skills to offer an effective solution to this widespread problem. A solution which empowers our users to live better without the use of pain killers or expensive therapies. The HIT team sought to understand the most common causes and derive an optimal solution for the large population of people living with non-specific back pain.</p>
<p>The realization of the S3 has personally and professionally engaged me over the past five years and our vision, our passion, is to share the benefits of the S3 with many. Thoughtfully considered, carefully executed, optimally designed, the S3 is the marriage of design, science and technology in pursuit of better spinal health and wellness.</p>

</div></div>","Moving Physical Therapist and Chiropractors to the Digital Age - Stage 1
 
Stage 1
In order to move the Physical Therapist and Chiropractors to the Digital Age, we need to complete our App that we have started.
 

Super Smart Stick and Big Kitty Labs – the perfect partners
 
HIT, llc searched high and low for the perfect partner to help us realize the benefits of pairing the S3 with our sensor platform and providing the best Mobile app experience we could design. We found the perfect partner with Big Kitty Labs, Columbus, OH. Dan Rockwell, CEO and Tushar Kulkarni, Co-founders of Big Kitty Labs, have been instrumental in the design and development of our companion Mobile app.
 
Their expertise and guidance has helped us move quickly and focus on early validation and testing, targeting the release of our MVP later this year. As we continue to add user centered features and value, their team provides the skill set and value to evolve and refine our Mobile app road map and bring our users a delightful experience.
 
The S3 App aims to provide a platform for coaching and guided progress to assure safe, beneficial daily use of the S3 for a variety of applications. The S3 coaching content is designed to be specific enough to address the needs of our users, easy to access content and assess progress. Further, the platform will provide care partners of all varieties, a one-to-one connection with their constituents in the future, allowing professional evaluation, as users progress through various therapies.
THE SUPER SMART STICK.............FOR THE PROFESSIONALS
To the Professionals!
The demands of higher workloads and documentation standards coupled with lower reimbursements (PDGM) makes day to day operations for health care professional extremely challenging. Trying to balance the demands of caseload and documentation, while also trying to maintain a high standard of patient care, can lead to high degrees of clinician burnout and declining patient outcomes and employee satisfaction.
The Super Smart Stick was designed to address issues that healthcare professionals are facing such as Work Flow Efficiency, improving patient outcomes, and collecting data digitally.
The Super Smart Stick was designed with the vision in mind of benefitting all brands of therapy: Home Health, Sports Medicine, Chiropractic, Sports Performance and Wellness.
Work Flow Efficiency
 
 



 
Indeed, the S3 is not just another wellness device, but a platform for health, healing and wellness that anyone can benefit from.
Stage 2
We are running stage 1 & 2 simultaneously. We did not want to ask for too much support to start with from the Indiegogo community. As we speak we are calculating our Beta Production.  Our aim with our Beta launch is to get our devices into the hands of 10 lucky people.  With that hand off, we will gather important information.  We want to know the in's and out's of what people think about our design, routines and app.
This information will help us tweak any necessary issues before launching The Super Smart Stick to the world.
By running these two Stages simultaneously, We want to ensure that we keep our launch date of September 2020 accurate. Equipped with all the whistles and bells that we are promising.  Everything about our device The Super Smart Stick  will be tried, tested and confirmed.
Youngstown State University

One of our most important partners is the Engineering department at Youngstown State University. On February 13th, Rick Eberts and I went to introduce the Super Smart Stick to the Engineering Students at YSU.  The purpose of our visit was to introduce the Super Smart Stick as a project for the students to use. Their mission is to stress test, design test and software test our product.  To determine the possible weakness and liabilities of the Super Smart Stick and provide us with recommendations to improve our device before it hits the market.

This step is extremely important! We are not only doing a beta launch to determine the pitfalls and use the recommendations to improve our device, we have taken it one step further! We have  a University Engineering department test the device for defects. Now that is Super Smart!



 

 
What makes the Super Smart Stick (S3) so SMART?
Its versatility and its design.  With the S3 you can replace all that bulky expensive gym equipment with a single hand held device that you can adapt to your own personal needs.  We can work with YOU and your health practitioner or therapist to achieve your targeted, measurable goals.



 

 

 
 
TESTIMONIALS 

Chad has spent most of his adult life living with back pain which he got from playing sports. His greatest wish is to be able to play with his kids and maybe get a few rounds of golf in!!

After just 6 weeks of using the Super Smart Stick Chad can feel a positive change in his back pain – no painkillers, no ice treatment.  He can feel the improved core stability which is helping to control his back pain.
THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT 


PERFORMANCE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
Training efficiently has never been this easy.




 
Sitting is the New Smoking Epidemic
In the past 30 years we've transitioned from manufacturing and labor jobs to knowledge and service work.  Sedentary work and lifestyles mean that sitting down has become the ""New Smoking Epidemic"" because of the health risks it poses.  Sitting weakens core spinal muscles, leading to a higher risk of injury and compromised movement.

 

With guided routines you can:-

Decrease the nagging pain from a desk job
Increase range of motion and mobility safely
Increase pushing/pulling, hinging/squatting capabilities
Improve core activation in countless positions
Decrease back injuries in vulnerable positions
Increase movement efficiency


Who are Health Intrinsic Technology
Joseph Bleacher
Co-Owner and C.E.O of Health Intrinsic Technology Super Smart Stick

I was born on Friday the 13th in September of 1963. I was born with neo-natal hepatitis. I was jaundice and had orange hair. They did exploratory surgery where I had 13 stitches. The doctor told my mother to take me to the priest to get my last rights read to me. So she did. I had my last rights read to me when I was 3 months old. My mother took me and prayed to Saint Anthony.
So here I am at 56 married for 32 years and have had 4 young adults.SO I BEAT THE ODDS!
I grew up in Youngstown Ohio my father Dr. John H.O. Bleacher was the first pediatric surgeon in our community. So my Father was a local legend here in Youngstown. Being the only pediatric surgeon he operated on in the area. It’s Great to hear, Oh your Dr. Bleacher’s Son?! You’re dad was a Great Man and a Great surgeon... those hands he had such big hands and he operated on those little babies. And then they would proceed to tell me how their Son or daughter are in their 30’s with careers and kids and they are so so grateful. So our family has big shoes to fill.
Growing up I was a swimmer. What a Great way to learn discipline, hard work and that your efforts directly affect the outcome. I had a big passion for swimming and being 5’91/2” I was no Michael Phelps but the passion gave me the inspiration to try out for the University of Cincinnati swim team when Frank Busch was coach in the 80’s.
So where I’m going with this is that I have good grounding. I was able to walk on the UC Bearcats and be on the team and then my second year the team nominated me for captain.SO I BEAT THE ODDS!
After graduating from UC with honors in a BA in Marketing and Communication I soon moved to the U. K.  I joined the hospitality trade in the U.K. with Scottish and Newcastle Retail where I successfully led 5 units from failure to roaring success. I was showcased on the SKY Pub Channel to attract professional managers to operate units. I drove the Newly formed Barras brand by being on the Food Steering group where my idea for making “The Best of Barras”featured our most popular food items with the best margin in the center of a three folded Menu. It made the company Millions of Sterling. I then moved into marketing supporting the growth of 135 John Barbra’s units and 250 Hybrid units with marketing activities, incentives and kudos to our successful managers. Strategically supporting the growth of our business until we sold our multiple units to the Spirit group in the U.K. SO I BEAT THE ODDS!
We decided to move back to America to start new adventures. We relocated back to Youngstown to be close to my side of the family. We’ve been back here 7 years and we are looking to continue our successful streak.
At present I am co-owner & heading a start up called Legacy Christian Home Care. A non medical home care agency and just tucked a successful year under our belt.SO I BEAT THE ODDS!

We have the technology and the product and need your support to help educate the world on DEEPSPORt™! </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Sleep is the one thing we take for granted in our life and its the most important. Even as important as food and water, but its the first thing we sacrifice.  Sleep affects everything in our life from cognitive skills, diet, exercise, memory, mood, athletic performance and kids grades in school.  I spent the past year gaining a better understanding of Sleep as I was like most of you.  I just took it for granted, until I researched many sleep studies on athletes and athletic performance.  See, I was an athlete in college.    I am also the former CEO of Champs Sports.  I was never taught anything about sleep as an athlete or a business professional. Sleep affects everything and there needs to be a real product to gain a quality sleep on the market besides Melatonin and Ambien.  We spend 1/3 of our lives sleeping on bed sheets.  Our skin is the largest organ in our bodies, but we don't spend much time thinking about our bed sheets as a product that can help us sleep better.  We invest in mattresses and pillows, but we don't think about the sheets that touch our skin.  Now, I understand the importance of sleep and so should you!  DEEPSPORT™ will change the sleep industry forever.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest hurdle facing DEEPSPORT™ is the education needed as many people don't understand that the sheets you sleep on can truly make a difference.  This is why, if we can raise the capital, we can educate the consumer.  Everyone that we talked to has a sleep story, typically a sleepless night story.  They power through their sleep issues.  They take pills.  However, once they hear the DEEPSPORT™ story, they ask where can I purchase these sheets.  We need your help spreading the DEEPSPORT™ message.  There are many imitators out there claiming high thread counts, Egyptian cotton, Bamboo and other technologies that keep you cooler, drier and safer.  There is very little regulation in this industry.  DEEPSPORT™ has published clinical studies in Medical publications, uses an FDA certified technology in DERMATHERAPY® and an antimicrobial that protects you from bacteria and Bed Bugs.  At DEEPSPORT™ you rest assured, our product is real!  Change your Sheets!  Change your Life!</p>

</p><p>We have created this campaign to fund the production of children's

Kids

<p><b>HEALTHIEST SHOES FOR THE GROWING FEET</b></p>
<p>
After three years of development – together with foot health specialists
and field testing with the most demanding clients (kids) we came up
with a shoe which might well change the way kids´ footwear are
produced in the future.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463349227/160515_Feelmax_Content_image_03_ma5wlp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>WHAT HAS BEEN THE PROBLEM UNTIL NOW?</b></p><p>
Here is a shocking fact: 98% of the babies are born with perfect
feet. By the age of 10 years, 50% of the kids have already developed
deformities or other foot problems!!! And when we grow up this
percentage goes even higher. 
</p>
<p>
Terrible, isn´t it? However, people in the third world<a href=""#38766043"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise""> countries<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> have extremely strong and healthy feet. WHY?</p><p></p>
<p>
Because they don´t wear shoes! This is a fact backed by various scientific studies.</p>
<p>
In reality, we only need shoes to protect us against extreme temperatures, parasites and sharp objects like broken glass. 
</p>
<p>
Shoes
can harm the foot, especially when
they are not made to
fit the human foot.
Unfortunately, the majority of the shoes are just made to
fit sales strategies or fashion trends. How
many of us suffer?</p>
<p>
Kid's
foot differs in anatomy and function from the adult foot. It is wider
on toes, and narrowing down towards the heel.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459866775/DifferenceKidsAdultFoot_yvwo8t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>However,
the majority of the kids’ shoes are made by downsizing the adult
shoe shape – which makes
the shoes extremely stiff, heavy, and of wrong shape.<a href=""#54658580"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise""> Totally<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> inadequate for a small foot. 
</p>
<p>
During
the formative years it is very important to look after kid's
developing feet as they
easily adopt the shape of a shoe that is too restrictive<b> </b>(narrow
in width).
Creating problems for the rest of their life... The kid´s bones are

even light pressure in wrong place can cause significant alternations
in foot anatomy and bone structure.

<p>
<b>MISSION</b></p>
<p>
So,
kid´s shoes requires a<a href=""#21204730"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise""> design<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> and shape of their own. But no
footwear manufacturer has really taken the mentioned facts into
account. Our
satisfied adult clients – and foot professionals – have been
demanding us for correct and healthy shoes for kids, for years.
Until now, there was none on the marketplace. We noticed these
problems, and<a href=""#88734211"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise""> started<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> the development<a href=""#18795036"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise""> work<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a>. The mission was to create
first ever <b>HEALTHY
FOOTWEAR FOR KIDS</b>.</p>
<p>
We
came up with a new design of children footwear that will not hamper
their natural foot development.</p>
<p>
Compared
with “normal” shoes, the Feelmax®
shoes are very
<b>flexible, light,</b> and <b>very roomy</b> on toebox
– allowing room for the correct foot development without
restrictions and letting the foot muscles and tendons get their daily
exercise naturally and without additional effort.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463348509/160515_Feelmax_Content_image_02_jabtus.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Our

and ultra-flexible outsole,
which allows the foot to work as Mother Nature intended: with natural
movement, but protected. 
</b></p>
<p><br/></p><p>
Our
shoe construction has been patented.
Some of our footwear models feature the
world´s thinnest outsole:
developed together with world famous tire manufacturer<b>
</b>Continental®
and
made in Germany by them.</p><p>
Feelmax
shoes are much more complicated to produce than “normal” shoes,
but we
already pose a long track record,
reducing the risks associated in this new field. In kid´s shoes, we
will use the same proven techniques and materials we currently use in
adult´s shoes, to minimize any problems. The materials are tested to
be<a href=""#92179448"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise""> free<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> of harmful or toxic materials – a fact of utmost importance
in kid´s footwear.</p>

kids don´t want to take these shoes off.  Some kids of our test
group even cried when they have to use normal shoes again when the
winter came!<br/></p><div>
<br/><p>
<b>DOCTORS BACK UP FEELMAX SHOE CONCEPT</b></p>
<p>
Since
decades the doctors have<a href=""#44723704"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise""> recommended<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> the kids to go barefoot for
proper foot development. However,
walking barefoot on dirty pavements exposes children's feet to the
dangers of infection through accidental cuts and to severe
contusions, sprains or fractures. Not to mention extreme
temperatures.</p>
<p><i>Dr. Lee Bivings</i>, a pediatrician from Atlanta, estimates 99% of new born babies have perfectly normal feet - and in his clinic more than 60% of these same, shoe-wearing babies have acquired foot disabilities at six years of age. An ideal physiological shoe, the equivalent of barefootedness, would keep babies' feet normal!<br/></p>
<p><i>Tracy Byrne,</i> a podiatrist specialising in podopaediatrics:<br/>""Most children's shoes ought to come with a government health warning, they are like awful little bricks - too stiff, too rigid, with no flexibility at the sole and too much heel raise. “<br/></p>
<p>
And
when kids are obliged to wear shoes, all one can find are styles
which are stiff like casts, heavy, with all kind of unnecessary<a href=""#40665250"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise""> supports<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a>, pointy toeboxes and so on. 
</p>
<p>
The
human foot is one of the most complex parts of the body: it has
26 bones, and is laced with ligaments, muscles, blood vessels, and
nerves. Because the feet of young children are<a href=""#13869546"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Advertise""> soft<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> and pliable,
abnormal pressure can easily cause deformities. Neglecting foot
health invites problems in other parts of the body, such as the legs
and back.</p>

</div></div>","We are about to change kids footwear industry by creating the first-ever shoe for healthy foot development.
We have created this campaign to fund the production of children's
footwear never seen before – the Feelmax®
Kids
footwear.
HEALTHIEST SHOES FOR THE GROWING FEET

After three years of development – together with foot health specialists
and field testing with the most demanding clients (kids) we came up
with a shoe which might well change the way kids´ footwear are
produced in the future.WHAT HAS BEEN THE PROBLEM UNTIL NOW?
Here is a shocking fact: 98% of the babies are born with perfect
feet. By the age of 10 years, 50% of the kids have already developed
deformities or other foot problems!!! And when we grow up this
percentage goes even higher. 


Terrible, isn´t it? However, people in the third world countries have extremely strong and healthy feet. WHY?

Because they don´t wear shoes! This is a fact backed by various scientific studies.

In reality, we only need shoes to protect us against extreme temperatures, parasites and sharp objects like broken glass. 


Shoes
can harm the foot, especially when
they are not made to
fit the human foot.
Unfortunately, the majority of the shoes are just made to
fit sales strategies or fashion trends. How
many of us suffer?

Kid's
foot differs in anatomy and function from the adult foot. It is wider
on toes, and narrowing down towards the heel.However,
the majority of the kids’ shoes are made by downsizing the adult
shoe shape – which makes
the shoes extremely stiff, heavy, and of wrong shape. Totally inadequate for a small foot. 


During
the formative years it is very important to look after kid's
developing feet as they
easily adopt the shape of a shoe that is too restrictive (narrow
in width).
Creating problems for the rest of their life... The kid´s bones are
mainly soft cartilage until they ossify (harden) by late teens, so
even light pressure in wrong place can cause significant alternations
in foot anatomy and bone structure. 




MISSION

So,
kid´s shoes requires a design and shape of their own. But no
footwear manufacturer has really taken the mentioned facts into
account. Our
satisfied adult clients – and foot professionals – have been
demanding us for correct and healthy shoes for kids, for years.
Until now, there was none on the marketplace. We noticed these
problems, and started the development work. The mission was to create
first ever HEALTHY
FOOTWEAR FOR KIDS.

We
came up with a new design of children footwear that will not hamper
their natural foot development.

Compared
with “normal” shoes, the Feelmax®
shoes are very
flexible, light, and very roomy on toebox
– allowing room for the correct foot development without
restrictions and letting the foot muscles and tendons get their daily
exercise naturally and without additional effort.Our
shoes feature an ultrathin
and ultra-flexible outsole,
which allows the foot to work as Mother Nature intended: with natural
movement, but protected. 


Our
shoe construction has been patented.
Some of our footwear models feature the
world´s thinnest outsole:
developed together with world famous tire manufacturer
Continental®
and
made in Germany by them.
Feelmax
shoes are much more complicated to produce than “normal” shoes,
but we
already pose a long track record,
reducing the risks associated in this new field. In kid´s shoes, we
will use the same proven techniques and materials we currently use in
adult´s shoes, to minimize any problems. The materials are tested to
be free of harmful or toxic materials – a fact of utmost importance
in kid´s footwear.

Feelmax®
is a company from Finland, producing the healthiest shoes and
toe-socks since 1999: we are really the front-runner in this segment.
YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE FEELMAX SHOES

The
Feelmaxes put smile on their face, and it´s easy to see why: They
are just so comfortable, they feel so good! They don´t press the
toes together, they are light:  they work together with the feet, not against it. 
It´s
just like going barefoot... and we all know this is the way the
doctor´s recommend for proper foot development. The
kids don´t want to take these shoes off.  Some kids of our test
group even cried when they have to use normal shoes again when the
winter came!

DOCTORS BACK UP FEELMAX SHOE CONCEPT

Since
decades the doctors have recommended the kids to go barefoot for
proper foot development. However,
walking barefoot on dirty pavements exposes children's feet to the
dangers of infection through accidental cuts and to severe
contusions, sprains or fractures. Not to mention extreme
temperatures.
Dr. Lee Bivings, a pediatrician from Atlanta, estimates 99% of new born babies have perfectly normal feet - and in his clinic more than 60% of these same, shoe-wearing babies have acquired foot disabilities at six years of age. An ideal physiological shoe, the equivalent of barefootedness, would keep babies' feet normal!
Tracy Byrne, a podiatrist specialising in podopaediatrics:""Most children's shoes ought to come with a government health warning, they are like awful little bricks - too stiff, too rigid, with no flexibility at the sole and too much heel raise. “

And
when kids are obliged to wear shoes, all one can find are styles
which are stiff like casts, heavy, with all kind of unnecessary supports, pointy toeboxes and so on. 


The
human foot is one of the most complex parts of the body: it has
26 bones, and is laced with ligaments, muscles, blood vessels, and
nerves. Because the feet of young children are soft and pliable,
abnormal pressure can easily cause deformities. Neglecting foot
health invites problems in other parts of the body, such as the legs
and back.




 WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT

Yes,
we need your support to fund this exiting project and get it running. There are considerable initial expenses connected
with running this project; upfront investments must be made in
outsole molds, cutting dies, shoe lasts and  material stocks
associated with the production.

So
we are raising funds which will enable us to produce the
first shoes, expand and operate in a broader way. In the meantime, we
must count on people like you, almost for the very success of this
project. 


We
would be most grateful if you can support us; either by preordering
the kid´s footwear, or... by buying the healthiest shoes or toesocks for
yourself. We have several styles for adults; for big variety of uses,
for ladies and gents, for old and young... You can see the current
styles here:

And Please Don't Forget, If
you read this and you want to help but you have neither time nor money it doesn’t mean that you can’t help, you can use the
social media platform, to share this with your family and friends.

We
do hope you will honor our request for help. It will mean a great deal to us if you do so.

Und ohne Hufschuhe wäre ich natürlich auch nicht dahin gekommen ohne auf das Reiten verzichten zu müssen. Unsere Gegend ist recht barhufunfreundlich.

Meine Pferde, selbst der Rehe-Patient, haben mittlerweile super gute Hufe, dank der Hilfe von dir, lieber Günter! Wir haben viele Schuhe probiert während der Umstellungszeit, jedoch nach ein paar Wochen auch längere Strecken ohne Schuhe reiten können. Zum Fahren verwenden wir noch Schuhe, die ich durch Günters Beratung gekauft habe und bin super zufrieden. ENGLISH VERSION  Even Leonardo Da Vinci rightly acknowledged: “The perfect, natural hoof is exactly what the horse needs.” For a long time, we researched what it takes to develop a horse boot appropriate for this natural masterpiece.   For the alpha horse boots team and its development, 35 years of valid experience in hoof processing are decisive. Meet our team: Manfred, Arabian horse breeder and trail rider; Günter, blacksmith in charge of hoof care and technical horse boot consultant since horse boots exist, and Susanne, technical horsewoman and technical horse boot consultant.With your help, we would like to launch the first, patent-pending, length- and width-adjustable shoe for horses with a self-cleaning treaded sole onto the market. Our horse boot has been conceived according to the natural model of horses’ hoofs and human feet biomechanics. It incorporates aerospace technology and materials from human orthopedics. For the sole tread, we studied automobile tire treads. We tested the materials that we use and consulted specialists when we had challenges or problems.Several partners and investors who supported us in this process were so enthusiastic with our result that they helped us to finance the development and prototypes. Customers and equestrian fans were more than willing to subject their horses to an endurance test with this novel horse boot. Thanks to their valuable suggestions, we can now offer an optimal horse boot design.It is now ready for production in series, but we need your help to start! Order the new alpha horse boots now so we can start manufacturing them by the end of 2017 at the latest. To achieve this, we need €145,000.00. Our alpha horse boots can be worn during all hoof processing stages and can be perfectly adapted during the conversion from iron to bare hoof; they do not cause any wounds and abrasion spots, they do not rotate, and do not get lost.Their self-cleaning tread offers optimal grip and maximum impact absorption. The circumferential mustang roll supports the natural hoof mechanism. An extensive pad system offers the optimal support when the horse’s hoof is placed under pressure.The new alpha horse boots even impress experienced horse boot technicians because we have detected known weak spots and optimized them. Regardless of the hoof shape, no twisting occurs and there are no pressure and abrasion spots. They are quickly put on and taken off without a tool, are easily cleaned, and have a stylish and colorful appearance.alpha horse boots are made in the heart of Europe with the help of skin-friendly, recyclable, and sustainable materials that cause the least possible damage to human beings and the environment.Together, we want to support a social project – as soon as development and manufacturing costs are covered – by donating by 2% of the profits from each pair of horseshoes sold. We would like to decide what project to support together with you, although we would very much like our donations to benefit an children's or animal aid organization. Our alpha horse boots are adjustable in 3 sizes in length and even 4 sizes in width. This allows us to achieve a fit that makes twisting and losing almost impossible. The ergonomic fit developed down to the last detail offers maximum galloping comfort to your horse and the highest possible safety to you. alpha horse boots are made of 4 highly innovative components, all of them exchangeable and renewable.Half shell with adjusting wedgesThree wedges per shoe ensure the optimal adjustment of the size. For narrowing, widening and stepping. Gecko grip soleHighly flexible sole with self-cleaning and extremely non-slip profile. Can also be retrofitted with studs and spikes. Crossover gaiterFor the perfect hoof fit. No losing, no turning, no pressure and scrubbing! InsoleRecessed insole, which does not slip. Optional in 4 mm, 6 mm for shock absorption or with frog support  We worked very intensively the last two years and did all of our “homework”. Now we need your help. You support us by pre-ordering your new horseshoes. Since it can take several months until we complete your order, we thank you for your patience by giving you an unbeatable low price. We retrieve the sum that we need for production and are able to finance it with the money.Why does it work that way? First, the money is used to purchase tools to manufacture all sizes and the material can be pre-financed. Labor costs for initial production must also be paid. We will not exploit any people. Everyone who works must receive a salary every month from the start. The person who receives a fair wage will make an effort to produce the quality that all of us require! What you receive when you pre-order alpha horse boots:You receive your finished, pre-assembled alpha horse boots in the size that you ordered. There will be five sizes; we will ask what size and color you want via e-mail shortly before production starts. With each shoe, you get wedges for narrowing or widening, the small parts needed for this, easily understandable instructions, and the key that you need for changing. The half shell of the shackle gaiter and Velcro fastener are always black colored. The gecko grip treaded sole is always deep dark red. The gaiters are always gray padded inside. The exterior of the gaiters comes in three colors: pink, turquoise, and gray.  Incidentally, we are so convinced of the quality of the alpha horse boots that we guarantee them for 2 years. It is possible to extend the warranty by 12 additional months with a small insurance fee. Our service will also impress you.

Yes, It Really Does.We received some pretty skeptical remarks from our social media audience early on - and we understand. Like you, we've been told stories of revolutionary products 'just around the corner' that never panned out. Founder & CEO Stuart Heatherington takes a unique approach to answering his critic's questions in his latest video which proves the DreamPort™ Sleep Solution does exactly what he says it will. Endorsement: Steve Moore - Respiratory & Sleep Device Professional""As a 33 year veteran of the sleep therapy business I have seen the entire  progression of CPAP masks. Not much has  changed since 1984 except that manufacturers now use silicone and  somewhat lighter straps.In  2012 I was part of the development team for the TAP PAP Nasal Pillow Mask, which was the first CPAP mask to completely eliminate headgear. The TAP PAP used a mouthpiece engaged on the upper teeth to secure it in  place. While the TAP PAP worked well, I find the DreamPort far more comfortable because it does not engage on the teeth, which often get very sore. The  DreamPort is extremely comfortable since it does not press against or enter my nares. It gives me freedom to move throughout the night without any leaks."" Can Your Mask Do This? The DreamPort™ Sleep Solution CanThis Is It—The Whole Bleeping StoryNot sleeping sucks. Not sleeping and spending a fortune on CPAP devices that leak, fall off or leave strap marks on your face sucks even worse. At least, that’s the conclusion Bleep Founder & CEO Stuart Heatherington came to one fateful night at 3:30 am from the kitchen table. “I tried every mask solution I could find and they all sucked,” said Stuart. “There had to be a better way. Totally frustrated, sitting at the kitchen table one sleepless night I sketched out what would ultimately become the DreamPort™ Sleep Solution – the first maskless CPAP solution that actually works.”After 8 years in development, Bleep is proud to introduce the lightest, most ergonomically accommodating CPAP solution on the planet – a device that fits comfortably and doesn’t restrict your movement – enabling patients to get a better night’s sleep and stick with their therapy. How it WorksThe DreamPort™ Sleep Solution consists of a DreamWay™ base unit and 32 pairs of disposable DreamPorts™(a 1-month supply). The DreamWay™ unit is made up of a 10-inch hose and universal port which connects to your existing 6-foot or 7-foot CPAP supply line. The DreamPorts™ use a hypoallergenic surgical tape, manufactured by 3M, to keep the port in place which works very much like a high quality adhesive bandage. Before sleeping, peel the backing off each DreamPort™, position over each nostril and secure the adhesive to the shape of your nose. Once in position, snap the DreamPorts™ into the flexible DreamWay™ unit and connect to your supply line. Once in place, turn on your CPAP pump as you normally would.What We Will Do With the FundingBleep’s goal is simple: To make the best bleeping CPAP solutions on the planet. We won’t stop until every sleep apnea patient is sleeping like a baby.Every dollar contributed will be used to achieve our four primary objectives:
To support product testing
To better the user experience
To accelerate manufacturing, and
To increase consumer awareness
Simply put, the more money we raise, the better we can make our products, the more sleep apnea patients we can reach and the sooner we can put a DreamPort™ Sleep Solution into the hands of patients. What We're Trying to AchieveWe want to give every man, woman and child effected by sleep apnea a great night’s sleep. Our goal is simple: To make sleep apnea solutions that are comfortable enough that people will wear them, and work well enough that people will stick with them. Nothing Motivates Like Personal ExperienceA lifelong sleep apnea sufferer, Stuart has a keener interest than most in getting a good night’s sleep. He knows what it’s like to wake up more tired than when you go to bed. He knows what it means to snore so loudly your spouse and family members flee to the far corners of the house or banish you to the spare bedroom to get some relief. He knows the experience of being on the cusp of a deep, restful sleep, only to have it ruined by a few loud snorts and labored breaths of his own making.Simply put, sleep apnea is no bleeping fun . . . and Stuart knows that first hand. Stuart’s passion for finding a sleep solution that would work quickly became a full-time effort. At the time, his wife-to-be was working in the Carolina health system, caring for patients suffering from various sleep ailments. When she alerted him to an open position on the 3rd shift of a well-respected Carolina hospital, Stuart jumped at the opportunity to help his sleep-deprived brethren find that all-too-elusive good night’s rest.Study after study, patient after patient, he observed and noted what patients liked and what they struggled with—what worked, what didn’t—and contemplated which things he might be able to improve upon and how. He became a registered sleep technician, and eventually went on to own and operate his own sleep lab. More studies. More patients. More observations.  This Isn't For Everyone—But It is for Most Everyone“DreamPort™ isn’t for everyone . . . but it is for MOST sleep apnea sufferers,” Stuart explains of the device:
If you perspire a lot, it’s not for you (the adhesive won’t stick - you can sweat it off);
If you’re one of the few who are sensitive to tape, it’s not for you (though the tape is high quality hypoallergenic surgical tape); and

Yes. The DreamPort Sleep Solution includes a 10 inch hose and connector which will attach to your existing 6' or 7' supply hose. Just plug it in and you're good to go. If you'd like to see a demonstration, please view the Indiegogo video. Near the end, Stuart connects the hose while on set.  How long does it last? Do I have to wash this thing? Yes, you should wash your DreamPortSleep Solution each day. While the DreamPort Sleep Solution is disposable by design and intended only to be used for 30-days, you can reduce your risk of nosocomial infection by cleaning before or after each use. Each quarter, you will receive a completely new set. The DreamPorts themselves (the adhesive strips with connectors) are only good for a single use and should be disposed of daily - 1 set per day.  Do I need a prescription for the DreamPort Sleep Solution? Yes. The DreamPort Sleep Solution is by prescription only.  Will the adhesive really work? More importantly, will it hurt to take off? Yes, they really work. And no, it shouldn't hurt to take it off. The adhesive tape is a high quality hypoallergenic surgical tape manufactured by 3M and is in use on other medical products.

The cost will be on par with your existing CPAP solution - following Medicare's replacement schedule.  Is the DreamPort device FDA approved?

The good news is we've eliminated the most important ones. </strong></p><p><strong>Life Environments introduces powerful new technologies and capabilities to the market. It is undeniably a complex product.</strong> Your first question should be, “is this technically possible – and can this team really do it?” We had the same questions years ago.</p><p><strong>We decided the best way to address risks was to build, test and implement Life Environments first – then ask for your support.</strong> Over the past three years, we’ve worked hard, failed and worked even harder to make Life Environments a reality. It hasn’t been easy or pretty. However, we ultimately succeeded with perseverance and some of the brightest minds in the world. That’s right – our success has been made possible by experts with lots of letters after their names from around the world in areas of medicine, cognition, neurology, medicine, physics, consumer research, more physics, and entertainment technology geeks like us – and even more physics! In short, the technology development risks have been eliminated and we’re ready for the next step – our premier project!</p><p><strong>We’ve worked hard to mitigate the risks and challenges of creating this series.</strong> We own all technology and have backups ready for when life happens. Connecting in real time with our supporters can limit access in some areas due to digital and satellite access, but this has no effect on the completion of our project.</p><p><strong>One of our greatest threats is noise pollution – it’s a very big deal for us and you too!</strong> With more than 87,000 flights in America each day, aircraft represent the single greatest challenge we deal with. Transportation and road noise come in a distant second. However, with our custom-built audio capabilities, we can remove most errant sounds successfully while preserving the realism of the original environment. Naturally, “audio surgery” adds time, but we plan for this when scouting locations and project production.</p><p><strong>But, what about lions and tigers and bears and things that go bump in the night?</strong> Field dangers are always at the forefront of our production planning. We work with local experts in environmental, wildlife, security and other safety considerations before capturing an environment. For every hour we produce, more than 100 hours goes into risk mitigation. Believe it or not, ticks and mosquitoes are some of our greatest challenges! (You’ll learn how we deal with them in one of our livecasts!) While we cannot eliminate all risks, we work hard to mitigate them as much as possible for the safety of our crews and success of our projects.</p><p><strong>Like you, we also worry about things like zombie apocalypses, acts of God and Mountain Dew and Costa Rican Tarrazu coffee shortages.</strong></p></div>","It’s a scientific fact: you’re designed to interact with nature – but you probably don't do it enough. Nature plays critical roles in human health, performance, life quality and happiness.

We’re dedicated rule-breakers and conventional thought slayers with serious science and common-sense addictions we focus on real-world problems in innovative ways. In short, we’re making life a better place to be.We work every day to make life better to be with advanced science and thinking. Our work is made possible by a cast of hundreds of the brightest minds in the world – and wonderful people like you! Here are the key players that keep this train on its tracks - most of the time. Let's face it, bringing new advanced technology is replete with risks and challenges. The good news is we've eliminated the most important ones. Life Environments introduces powerful new technologies and capabilities to the market. It is undeniably a complex product. Your first question should be, “is this technically possible – and can this team really do it?” We had the same questions years ago.We decided the best way to address risks was to build, test and implement Life Environments first – then ask for your support. Over the past three years, we’ve worked hard, failed and worked even harder to make Life Environments a reality. It hasn’t been easy or pretty. However, we ultimately succeeded with perseverance and some of the brightest minds in the world. That’s right – our success has been made possible by experts with lots of letters after their names from around the world in areas of medicine, cognition, neurology, medicine, physics, consumer research, more physics, and entertainment technology geeks like us – and even more physics! In short, the technology development risks have been eliminated and we’re ready for the next step – our premier project!We’ve worked hard to mitigate the risks and challenges of creating this series. We own all technology and have backups ready for when life happens. Connecting in real time with our supporters can limit access in some areas due to digital and satellite access, but this has no effect on the completion of our project.One of our greatest threats is noise pollution – it’s a very big deal for us and you too! With more than 87,000 flights in America each day, aircraft represent the single greatest challenge we deal with. Transportation and road noise come in a distant second. However, with our custom-built audio capabilities, we can remove most errant sounds successfully while preserving the realism of the original environment. Naturally, “audio surgery” adds time, but we plan for this when scouting locations and project production.But, what about lions and tigers and bears and things that go bump in the night? Field dangers are always at the forefront of our production planning. We work with local experts in environmental, wildlife, security and other safety considerations before capturing an environment. For every hour we produce, more than 100 hours goes into risk mitigation. Believe it or not, ticks and mosquitoes are some of our greatest challenges! (You’ll learn how we deal with them in one of our livecasts!) While we cannot eliminate all risks, we work hard to mitigate them as much as possible for the safety of our crews and success of our projects.Like you, we also worry about things like zombie apocalypses, acts of God and Mountain Dew and Costa Rican Tarrazu coffee shortages.",24.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>It's been a rainy, mosquito and tick filled season in many parts of the country, and we've heard that mosquito activity is up about 30% in some places! Yikes! It's a huge tick season as well. The good news is that you don't need to soak yourself in toxic chemicals to keep the mosquitoes and ticks at bay. Years of informal field testing have given us some astonishing results, and we are continually improving our recipes. We've had some very promising USDA testing as well, with some of our preliminary tests in the Florida mosquito testing station yielding over 4 hours of complete protection! We recommend you re-apply every 2 hours for best results, however, especially if you are outside engaged in outdoor activities. Our water-based repellent is light and non-greasy, can be applied to clothes and skin. Our oil-based Wildthings Extreme is our fiercest potion (for skin only), lasting a few hours, with a light citrus scent. </p>

<h3>I've spent more than a decade working in the healthcare world, and I'm passionate about solving the Vitamin D deficiency and stopping human trafficking.  </h3>
<p>To me, Vitamin D to the Rescue is a win-win situation.  We've created a Vitamin D service that will deliver high quality Vitamin D3 right to your door.  We've even got an auto-ship program called ""Team Rescue"".  It drives me crazy to think that millions of people are plagued with health problems that really could be remedied with a simple, safe and inexpensive Vitamin D supplement.  </p>
<p>With Vitamin D to the Rescue we can harness the power of millions of people improving their health with Vitamin D by giving $5 from every bottle sold to organizations who are making a difference in the fight against human trafficking. </p>
<p>Ending human trafficking is an incredibly complex problem with many aspects to it.  No matter how you look at it, the organizations that are making a difference need money.  This is a mechanism for funding the good work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need to be able to tell our story on the national stage....and eventually the international stage.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Making compelling video content for social media platforms cost money.  So does manufacturing high quality Vitamin D3 and upgrading our website.  </p>
<p>We need $20,000:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place our first mass quantity bulk order from our manufacturer.</li>
<li>Upgrade our website and social media. </li>
<li>Create professional videos featuring real stories of human trafficking survivors, real testimonies of Vitamin D supplementation improving health and telling the story and mission of Vitamin D to the Rescue.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could donate money directly to a non-profit fighting human trafficking or better yet, you can help us create a massive platform for raising a lot of money to fight human trafficking while also creating awareness of the epidemic of Vitamin D deficiency and the atrocity of human trafficking. We can take your donated dollar and multiply it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the challenges we face is that many people have no idea of the importance of Vitamin D.  I have spent the past decade learning how to educate people about this and I'm happy to share that awareness is growing.  </p>
<p>Another challenge is that many people are unaware of the magnitude of the problem of human trafficking, but the awareness is growing!  I sit on the board of a local non-profit that fights human trafficking in my area, and we've learned that initially our primary mission is to spread awareness in our community.</p>

<h3>AERO-SWING Training Approach Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is Bill Orosz and I am the inventor of the AERO-SWING Training Approach for Golf.  </p>
<p>I am an Engineer and an avid golfer.  The Aero-Swing is a patented swing speed product I invented over a year ago.  I have multiple patents in technical fields and also in the golfing world.</p>
<p>This campaign is dedicated to taking Aero-Swing to the next level;  <strong>AERO-SWING TRAINING APPROACH</strong> - Providing a Swing Speed shaft ""Aero-Shaft"" specifically made to hold Aero-Swings to help increase a golfer's swing speed.  A higher swing speed translates into a golf ball going further.  This system will come with a complete video tutorial on how to use the products and obtain your maximum swing speed.</p>
<p>Any funds generated from this site will help the Aero-Swing Training Approach (TA) reach the next level in helping golfers attain their ultimate swing speed levels.  I am passionate about taking this next generation of Aero-Swing to the golfing world.  There are many other swing speed products on the market today.  Aero-Swing Training Approach is the most versatile and effective swing speed trainer.  I want all of the golfers around the world to take notice of our product, and join us in this swing speed revolution!</p>
<p>I am relentless in my work ethic and effort.  In order to maximize the impact of launching this new product, I need help to roll out to the golfing community.  Although Aero-Swing has grown very quickly; product idea in fall 2019, Aero-Swing in all Golf Galaxies Summer of 2020, patent awarded in fall 2020, we still need all the energy and motivation that comes from a successful crowdfunding campaign.  It is extremely important that we gain as much momentum as possible and launch the Aero-Swing TA in an expedient, but well thought out approach.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our funding goal will contribute to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal in this campaign is $2,000.  We expect our costs to be more than our goal.</li>
<li>The stopper at the end of the Aero-Shaft has been 3D printed/prototyped and we are securing a U.S. based company to mold this piece.  We expect to have this out of production and delivered by mid March.</li>
<li>All assembly of this product will be in Louisville, KY.</li>
<li>We currently have our Aero-Shaft in production.  Expected delivery time is mid March.</li>
<li>New shipping boxes are already designed and on order.</li>
<li>We intend to advertise our Aero-Swing TA on all of the following platforms: Facebook Ads, YouTube Ads, Google Ads, Instagram, Pinterest and Amazon.</li>
<li>The ultimate offer will include an Aero-Shaft with stopper, 2 full sized Aero-Swings, 1 Aero-Swing Mini, one logo'd nylon component bag that will be used to hold all 3 Aero-Swings and the associated Aero-swing pieces that can be used for installing Aero-Swing on your own clubs.</li>
<li>The original Aero-Shaft will be 43.5 inches long, and will be made of graphite, 65 gram shaft with regular flex.  Our Aero-Swing logo will be imprinted on each shaft.  The Aero-Stopper will be epoxied at the end of the shaft.</li>
<li>We are also having our grips custom made.  Our Aero-Swing logo will be displayed on each grip.</li>
<li>Custom sized shipping boxes have been designed and are awaiting production.</li>
<li>Finally, when you order an Aero-Swing Training Approach system, you will get everything that is included in the first Aero-Swing offer, that is, you will get Aero-Swings with the components that allow a golfer to place Aero-Swing on their own clubs and train while hitting balls.  It is important to note that Aero-Swing TA items can also be used on a golfer's own clubs.</li>
<li>We fully expect to reach our funding goal.  If the funding goal isn't met, we will still proceed with our Aero-Swing Training Approach system.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>There really don't seem to be any hurdles to overcome with the Aero-Swing Training Approach.  All pieces are either in stock, in production, or in the final stages of design.  A previous product, Aero-Swing has already proven itself to be a successful swing speed product, having been launched in 96 Golf Galaxy stores shortly after its availability.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute to our launch, or if you are not a golfer, please forward this campaign to any of those who you might think could benefit from our Aero-Swing TA product!!!</p>

The ultimate offer will include an Aero-Shaft with stopper, 2 full sized Aero-Swings, 1 Aero-Swing Mini, one logo'd nylon component bag that will be used to hold all 3 Aero-Swings and the associated Aero-swing pieces that can be used for installing Aero-Swing on your own clubs.
The original Aero-Shaft will be 43.5 inches long, and will be made of graphite, 65 gram shaft with regular flex.  Our Aero-Swing logo will be imprinted on each shaft.  The Aero-Stopper will be epoxied at the end of the shaft.
We are also having our grips custom made.  Our Aero-Swing logo will be displayed on each grip.
Custom sized shipping boxes have been designed and are awaiting production.
Finally, when you order an Aero-Swing Training Approach system, you will get everything that is included in the first Aero-Swing offer, that is, you will get Aero-Swings with the components that allow a golfer to place Aero-Swing on their own clubs and train while hitting balls.  It is important to note that Aero-Swing TA items can also be used on a golfer's own clubs.
We fully expect to reach our funding goal.  If the funding goal isn't met, we will still proceed with our Aero-Swing Training Approach system.


Risks & Challenges
There really don't seem to be any hurdles to overcome with the Aero-Swing Training Approach.  All pieces are either in stock, in production, or in the final stages of design.  A previous product, Aero-Swing has already proven itself to be a successful swing speed product, having been launched in 96 Golf Galaxy stores shortly after its availability.

Other Ways to Help
If you cannot contribute to our launch, or if you are not a golfer, please forward this campaign to any of those who you might think could benefit from our Aero-Swing TA product!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Ladies &amp; gentlemen, friends and family,</p>
<p>My name is José E. Guillén, and I'm a Physician Assistant student on a mission. As some of you already know, I have a history of coordinating and carrying out sustainable public health/medical projects in low resource parts of the world. I helped design and build a medical supplies depot in Haiti; carried out important sexual health research in the townships of South Africa, and helped provide medical care to migrant workers in Southern Georgia. </p>
<p>I'm now coordinating with a clinic in Nicaragua that provides care to a community of trashpickers; families that were resettled by the government, and in many cases have had to turn to extremes to get by. With your help, I hope to work as a medical provider for the clinic, and conduct research which will empower local government to provide the sort of sustainable change that the community both desires and needs. Aides from within the community will be sought out and trained, so that the knowledge we glean will stay within the population. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Ok, how can I help, and what shinies can I unlock?</h3> <p>I will be traveling to Nicaragua with a team in late May, and staying until early July. The total cost is estimated to be around $3000, broken down into:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Flight --------------------------$800</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Housing-----------------------$700</span></li>

<li>Car rental/taxi/etc---------$500</li>
<li>Aide wage---------------------$500</li>
<li>Misc expenses----------------$200</li>
</ul>
<div>Now, what do <i>you </i>get for helping me with this excellent humanitarian endeavor? Apart from having done your good deed for the season, donors will receive the following according to their highest level of contribution:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Access to my hilarious, well written, and highly lauded travel blog------------$5</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A handwritten postcard. Snailmail! Stamps with real spit!----------------------$25</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I will write an insightful (?) and fantastic (!) limmerick/haiku with you as the source material, which you can elect to have featured on the blog-----------$100</span></li>
<li>A ""poster"" from Nicaragua. I have no idea what, but it will be great-----------$250</li>
<li>One bizarre item which I find in the formidable depths of the Managua marketplace, with its picture taken in various places in and around the country, and a song written by the team detailing its adventures abroad--------------$500</li>
<li>A local craftsman will create an item worthy of your generosity, with your name engraved upon it, and all manner of praise be heaped upon you-------------$1000</li>
</ul>
<div><i><u>MOREOVER</u></i></div>
</div>
<div>If the $3000 is raised in full, I will ""convince"" the team (read: get the team drunk and suggest in an off-hand fashion how <i>hilarious </i>it would be were they) to perform a song on video about our various, accidental and inevitable mis-adventures interacting with local culture/customs! I make no claim as to the quality of said video, given that none of us have musical training, but I feel this will only make it more exciting for all donors.</div>
<div><h3>Ok, ok, so you have ideas...but what <i>exactly </i>will you be doing while you're in Nicaragua? </h3></div>
<div>There is a massive document detailing our exact rationale, plan of action, and in country deliverable, but the short version is:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>A door to door survey collecting qualitative data about general health, sexual health options, domestic violence and food security. This data will be analyzed and given back to community leaders so that they have a better sense of what issues are most pressing, and/or most important to the population.</li>
<li>Focus groups exploring views on domestic violence in the community.</li>
<li>A medical rotation at the local community health clinic, with a focus on OB/GYN and infectious diseases. </li>
</ul></div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Sounds like a lot; what's the DC of this endeavor?</h3>
<div>You are right, dear reader, to wonder about the difficulties inherent in this project. Thankfully, I am a well practiced researcher (going on 12 years experience), a burgeoning medical provider (this will also serve as my 6th medical rotation), and a seasoned (spicy) traveler. More to the point, I am part of a team of equally qualified individuals, all with the benefit of Emory University and the Global Health Institute's backing.</div>

</div></div>","What is that crazy Mexican doing now...
Ladies & gentlemen, friends and family,
My name is José E. Guillén, and I'm a Physician Assistant student on a mission. As some of you already know, I have a history of coordinating and carrying out sustainable public health/medical projects in low resource parts of the world. I helped design and build a medical supplies depot in Haiti; carried out important sexual health research in the townships of South Africa, and helped provide medical care to migrant workers in Southern Georgia. 
I'm now coordinating with a clinic in Nicaragua that provides care to a community of trashpickers; families that were resettled by the government, and in many cases have had to turn to extremes to get by. With your help, I hope to work as a medical provider for the clinic, and conduct research which will empower local government to provide the sort of sustainable change that the community both desires and needs. Aides from within the community will be sought out and trained, so that the knowledge we glean will stay within the population.    Ok, how can I help, and what shinies can I unlock? I will be traveling to Nicaragua with a team in late May, and staying until early July. The total cost is estimated to be around $3000, broken down into:


Flight --------------------------$800
Housing-----------------------$700
Food---------------------------$300
Car rental/taxi/etc---------$500
Aide wage---------------------$500
Misc expenses----------------$200

Now, what do you get for helping me with this excellent humanitarian endeavor? Apart from having done your good deed for the season, donors will receive the following according to their highest level of contribution:



Access to my hilarious, well written, and highly lauded travel blog------------$5

A handwritten postcard. Snailmail! Stamps with real spit!----------------------$25
I will write an insightful (?) and fantastic (!) limmerick/haiku with you as the source material, which you can elect to have featured on the blog-----------$100
A ""poster"" from Nicaragua. I have no idea what, but it will be great-----------$250
One bizarre item which I find in the formidable depths of the Managua marketplace, with its picture taken in various places in and around the country, and a song written by the team detailing its adventures abroad--------------$500
A local craftsman will create an item worthy of your generosity, with your name engraved upon it, and all manner of praise be heaped upon you-------------$1000

MOREOVER

If the $3000 is raised in full, I will ""convince"" the team (read: get the team drunk and suggest in an off-hand fashion how hilarious it would be were they) to perform a song on video about our various, accidental and inevitable mis-adventures interacting with local culture/customs! I make no claim as to the quality of said video, given that none of us have musical training, but I feel this will only make it more exciting for all donors.
Ok, ok, so you have ideas...but what exactly will you be doing while you're in Nicaragua? 
There is a massive document detailing our exact rationale, plan of action, and in country deliverable, but the short version is:

A door to door survey collecting qualitative data about general health, sexual health options, domestic violence and food security. This data will be analyzed and given back to community leaders so that they have a better sense of what issues are most pressing, and/or most important to the population.
Focus groups exploring views on domestic violence in the community.
A medical rotation at the local community health clinic, with a focus on OB/GYN and infectious diseases. 



    Sounds like a lot; what's the DC of this endeavor?
You are right, dear reader, to wonder about the difficulties inherent in this project. Thankfully, I am a well practiced researcher (going on 12 years experience), a burgeoning medical provider (this will also serve as my 6th medical rotation), and a seasoned (spicy) traveler. More to the point, I am part of a team of equally qualified individuals, all with the benefit of Emory University and the Global Health Institute's backing.
In other words, we got this. 
    What if I'm also a dirt poor student and can't give you any of my hard earned monies because I don't want to eat ramen and Elmer's Glue for the next month? I've been there, dear reader. If you support this project with your heart, but your wallet isn't up to it, please do your best to spread the word. Facebook, emails, Tweets and word of mouth go a long way!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Since
March 2013, Hoop Mania has been a vibrant and game-changing monthly 3 on 3 basketball tournament in the Johannesburg inner-city. Hoop Mania has created a culture of self-managed space, where
the people who live in the neighbourhood and use the park and court daily are the ones who create
events and ensure that the space is clean and safe and an asset to the local community. The people who play at the court consistently are
the ones running the tournaments, learning new management skills, building their
CVs, and growing networks.</p>
<p>These tournaments are part of Boundless City’s larger vision of community-based urban development. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why a League?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Up to now, Hoop Mania has operated as monthly tournaments. We
would like to expand this to be more consistent and valuable to the local community: this will take the format of a 3 on 3 league. This provides greater
opportunity for consistency, skills development, impact, and growth of the
sport.</p>
<p>The basic structure is:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>8-12 teams of 5-6 players per team</li>
<li>8 week season (6 weeks of regular season games, 2 weeks of playoffs)</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Operating under FIBA 3x3 Rules</span></li>
<li>Saturday morning free basketball clinics for neighbourhood youth</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We hope this league can be run for many seasons, and can become self-sustaining, needing little or no sponsorship in order to exist. For this reason we will be charging registration fees for the opening season which will feed into continuing in future seasons. Assistance with funding is needed this first season to get the league off the ground.</p>
<p>A breakdown of estimated costs:</p> <ul> <li>Sound: $200</li>
<li>Team Uniforms: $800</li>
<li>Officiating: $400</li>

It is important to understand that this clinic is miles from the closest </span>electrical<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>utility<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> line, so without a sustainable and locally sourced form of energy the clinic is at risk of operating without electricity.

<p>AED is a renewable energy company based in Plymouth, Massachusetts. With
expertise in sustainable energy and a passion for developing projects that aid
water production to regions in need, AED has developed it's “PV4Water<sup>©</sup>”
(and Wind4Water<sup>©</sup>) systems. These systems provide sustainable, fresh
water and power to campuses and villages utilizing the sun’s energy. The
PV4Water© solution is a solar photovoltaic array which powers pumps for the
clinic’s well system, but is sized large enough to provide additional
electricity to the medical clinic itself.  Batteries will store enough
electricity for 24 hours of operation for the mission's critical equipment before
a small backup diesel generator is needed. The PV4Water© project will continue
to provide this power to the clinic with little or no maintenance requirements
for the next 25 years or more.</p>

<p><b>Raising Money: Why We Need Your Help</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In order for our campaign to be successful we need to raise a sum of $15,000.
AED has launched a fundraising capital drive to help pay for the
PV4Water© system. Engineering for the system is already completed, and it has
already received commitments for installation labor and travel costs. </p>
<p>The funds
raised will be used to procure the photovoltaic panels, inverter, and batteries
for the system at the medical clinic. Please help us reach our goal of 15,000We
are trying to raise the capital cost so the solar system can be the 'spotlight'
for the clinic’s grand opening on August 3, 2015. </p>
<p><b>Spread the Influence</b></p>
<p>Your contribution will not only bring
lifesaving health care through affordable, sustainable solar energy to the
primary care medical clinic in Fond Fred, but it will also help create a model
for health care facilities in other developing nations around the world!  </p>
<p>Globally, 99% of the earth’s water is not fit for consumption and needs
to be processed. Further, 1.1 Billion of the earth’s inhabitants (1 in 6) do
not have access to fresh water, according to the World Health Organization.
This is especially true in the country of Haiti, where an estimated 7,500
children and families live without fresh water or medical care - just in the
Fonfred area, located outside of Les Cayes.</p>

<br/>
<p><b>Our Plan</b></p>
<p>AED has been fortunate
enough to have received (and has provided) donations in labor, but we still need
funding to procure the system and integrate it to the medical clinic. Our goal
is $15,000 to complete the construction of the clinic with PV4Water©.</p>
<p>Many people have already
donated to the medical clinic project, which has funded the construction of the clinic building and drinking water wells. Our focus is to raise additional funding for the PV4Water© components of solar panels, batteries, and inverter.  Vendors of these products are providing
steeply discounted prices for the project. We also face cost needs for shipping
costs.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With the support we have been given to date, we firmly
expect to reach our goals for this special project.  If the goals are not reached immediately, the
system will be expanded as funds allow.  All
funds raised will go directly to AED’s <i>Forward
in Health</i> medical clinic project account.</p>
<p>We have arranged a special gift for those who can contribute
at any level, a personalized ‘Thank You’ letter suitable for framing. </p>

<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Your campaign contribution to this world-class project is
important – not only to the people of Fonfred, Haiti, but all around the
world.  By creating self-sustaining,
low maintenance clinics, remote villages everywhere become accessible.  Only such ‘distributed energy’ projects such
as solar PV systems are able to quickly rebound from natural disasters and
provide modern assistance to those in need. </p>
<p>Even a small donation to the Fonfred PV4Water© clinic
goes a long way.  Each solar panel costs
about $250 USD.  Each battery also costs
about $250.  The people of Les Cayes area are
counting on your generosity to allow us to finish the project in one phase –
and enjoy a healthier life.</p>
<p><b>Transparency</b></p>
<p>There is a chance our goal is not reached; if that is the
case we will be required to downsize the initial solar system at the clinic
and continue fundraising, adding to the system as funds allow.  Until the entire system is installed, the
clinic will need to make hard choices with the limited amount of energy it can generate.</p>
<p>Because we are asking for your donation, it is reasonable
for you to know the risks we face.  From
a technology perspective, the risk is slight. 
Solar panels and storage batteries are well known and proven
devices.  The location has a plentiful solar
resource to power the clinic at optimal levels. 
Our biggest risks are centered around the transportation of the equipment to
Haiti. We are making special provisions to be such that no theft or vandalism
occurs during transit, including working with other NGO and non-profits who
import materials to Haiti regularly. 
After construction, two local members of the on-site team will be trained to handle
the little maintenance that these solar systems require, with assistance from
AED.</p>

We are Associated Energy Developers, LLC (AED) and we have taken the initiative to partner with a non-profit organization Forward in Health to complete the first sustainable solar powered medical clinic outside of Les Cayes, Haiti. Our campaign only pertains to the off-grid solar electricity system. Separate fundraising for the clinic itself has been underway for a number of years. It is important to understand that this clinic is miles from the closest electrical utility line, so without a sustainable and locally sourced form of energy the clinic is at risk of operating without electricity. In countries like Haiti where over 80% of people lack access to reliable electricity, off grid Solar PV systems are the only logical source of energy.




Who We Are 
AED is a renewable energy company based in Plymouth, Massachusetts. With
expertise in sustainable energy and a passion for developing projects that aid
water production to regions in need, AED has developed it's “PV4Water©”
(and Wind4Water©) systems. These systems provide sustainable, fresh
water and power to campuses and villages utilizing the sun’s energy. The
PV4Water© solution is a solar photovoltaic array which powers pumps for the
clinic’s well system, but is sized large enough to provide additional
electricity to the medical clinic itself.  Batteries will store enough
electricity for 24 hours of operation for the mission's critical equipment before
a small backup diesel generator is needed. The PV4Water© project will continue
to provide this power to the clinic with little or no maintenance requirements
for the next 25 years or more.


About Forward in Health

Forward in Health’s (www.forwardinhealth.org) mission is to
improve the health conditions and dignity of the people in and around Les Cayes, a remote, impoverished area of Haiti without adequate access utility grids.
Comprised of several Doctors of Medicine, the Forward in Health team has been working to improve health of
Haitian citizens since 2006.

(Full video profiling the Forward In Health organization)
Since the first time members of the nonprofit FIH traveled to Haiti, the need for a permanent, modern medical
presence in the area was obvious. Today, work is being
completed on  a primary care medical
clinic to bring lifesaving
health care to the people in this region of the country, who simply can’t
travel the estimated 3 – 4 hours to Port-au-Prince.  The Forward in Health clinic occupies 3 ½ acres of land.  This concise and extremely efficient building will provide a nurse station, physician exam rooms, a
laboratory, pharmacy, dental office, and radiology.  Boston
based designers and structural engineers have developed
blue-prints to maximize the use of the space.

Tickets alone for one day will be close to $100 for the 4 of us.The $600 that I am looking to get for this will go to the following:1. Tickets to the fair.2. Gas (3 hour drive one way)3. A hotel room for one night.4. Food while at the fair, before and after fair. (You cannot bring in outside food.)5. Activities during the fair.Here is a link to the website so you can get an idea of what RenFair is like: http://www.renfair.com/bristol/There is a map of the fair and it is over 15 acres big!This really will be like a mini vacation for my kids who deserve to have a great time after the last year + of dealing with all this. We would like to attend the fair on August 1st.  Any money raised beyond the $600 will be used for other activities over the summer with the kids.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Sherry Lydon and
I work as a Medical Assistant for a major cancer clinic in the mid-south. On a daily basis I see
what cancer does to sweet, loving people and to their families. Even though I feel
my job is rewarding in a way, doing my part to comfort my patients, I have
always longed for other ways to contribute towards preventing such horrible
diseases from ever starting.  To me, cancer,
autoimmune disorders, Parkinson’s, as well as other life-threatening diseases
sometimes can actually be PREVENTABLE! 
Most of the health issues facing our society today has a lot to do with
how we treat our bodies. Every day we
repeat the same bad habits by eating the same wrong things or we apply the same
toxic products to our super-absorbent skin. It is for this very reason I
decided to make my own healthy, all-natural makeup. </p>
<p>Actually,
I got the courage to start making my own foundation soon after Proctor &amp;
Gamble decided to no longer sell any of their Max Factor products here in the
United States.  Having worn Max Factor
pan-stick all my life I knew nothing else out there was for me. I am well aware of
the dangers involved with wearing most anything else on the market because of
all the harmful ingredients big corporations like to use. So with all
that in mind, I convinced myself I would have no choice but to make my
own.  I was convinced I could make
something that millions of other women would love to use because it would be
the safest, most natural, full coverage foundation available today! My pan stick only has (7) ingredients. They are: Coconut Oil MCT, Kaolin Clay, Argan Oil, Carnauba Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Titanium Dioxide, and Iron Oxides for color. For a more detailed explanation of each please go to my website's ingredients page by clicking here <a href=""http://www.factornaturals.com/ingredients.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.factornaturals.com/ingredients.html</a> <br/></p>
<p><b>Do current Sherry Lydon Cosmetics customers
like my product?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
they do! The best way to see what others think of my Factor Naturals pan-stick is to simply view my unbiased eBay feedback.  <a href=""http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&amp;userid=factornaturals15&amp;ftab=AllFeedback&amp;myworld=true&amp;rt=nc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewF...</a>   Here are just a few their comments.

<p><b>The reason for this campaign.</b></p>
<p>Right now, I am only selling my
product on my website, <a href=""http://www.factornaturals.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.factornaturals.com</a> and on eBay but to me this is
just not good enough because not enough women are being reached and informed
about my safe product.  My ultimate goal
is to reach the entire country through selling to national chains like Whole
Foods Market which specializes in only offering products that meet their
strictest safety standards. The only
problem with my ability to expand is my current production level. Currently, the largest batch I am able to make
is only 24 tubes. I need the capital to purchase the equipment to make batches
that will yield 150 to 200 tubes at a time. The funds would also go towards professional
photography, new labels and packaging, advertising, insurance, and to hopefully move into a slightly
larger building.</p>
<p><b>What you can receive for donating at

<p>I
will be glad to send a tube of our wonderfully safe makeup as a gift for
your gratuity, just let us know by going to the ""PERKS"" page and then just select the color that you would like. Even though I do have ten colors that I have UPC bar codes for, the gift shades that
are available are the same six shown on eBay. They are: Nude Ivory, True
Beige, Medium Beige, Medium Olive, Sun Tone, and Rich Beige.</p>

<p>Whatever

able to purchase the equipment to make larger quantity batches so that we can be
ready to reach more and more women with my safe product which is by far, the
ultimate goal. If my cause only helps to prevent just one person from being stricken
down with any kind of otherwise preventable disease, my ultimate goal will be met. Won’t you please help me to
make that happen? Thank you for your support! <br/></p>  <br/></div>","Introduction

our company's headquarters, or over Skype and other forms of online 
communication! Considering how we are tapping into the ENTIRE market of 
iPhones and iPods all over the United States, we 
need many people to do the jailbreaking efficiently and 
quickly!<br/><br/><p>Our training sessions and certification of jailbreakers will 
most definitely be a challenge, especially if we have employees from 
across the country and/or the world! However, we believe that online communication via 
Skype and the prospect of our current company employees going off to colleges around the
 country will allow for us to conveniently orientate new members into our family! We 
shall enforce consistency when it comes to jailbreak procedures by 
producing specific copyrighted instructions for each iOS and device 
model! It will take patience and experience to orientate employees, but with enough diligence and the right work 
ethic, we are sure that we can make a successful business 
model!</p>

<p>A: Yes! Jailbreaking your iPhone and iPod is kept legal through 2015 under an exemption in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>
<p>Q: Is jailbreak safe for my iPhone and/or iPod?</p>
<p>A: In professional hands, jailbreaking is absolutely safe! After 
customizing your Apple device with a trusted jailbreak tool, you have 
the option to enter ""Substrate Safe Mode"" by holding the volume up 
button while rebooting. This turns off all the tweaks installed on a 
jailbreak, leaving only Cydia functioning for troubleshooting. 
Otherwise, the Apple device essentially returns to ""vanilla"" or un-jailbroken 
iOS, and all iOS functions work perfectly. You can exit out of Substrate
 Safe Mode upon rebooting.</p>
<p>Q: Is jailbreak reversible?</p>
<p>A: Yes, and very easily too! Once you 
restore to the newest iOS via iTunes, your jailbreak shall be removed, 
leaving no indication that your phone was ever jailbroken in the first 
place! Your warrenty (if it didn't expire already) is instantly renewed!<br/></p>
<p>Q: Is my data secure after jailbreak?</p>
<p>A: On multiple tests, we discovered that data
 is NOT erased upon jailbreak! However, as an additional precautionary 
measure, we require that you back-up all of your data on your phone to a
 PC and find the back-up folder and know what to do with it before we 
proceed with the jailbreak.</p><p>Q: What if I have troubleshooting issues?<br/></p><p>A: We are making customer support and troubleshooting support a
 core service in our company! Along with troubleshooting guides for each
 questionable tweak, we intend on making Skype live-assistance readily available. We intend on providing a copyrighted document 
detailing the possible (if any) bugs of every tweak, what you
 should avoid, and you should do in case problems arise. And of 
course, we will make it mandatory for our jailbreakers to show you how to respring, enter temporary safe mode, and substrate 
safe mode as additional cautionary measures. That way, you can still 
use your iPhones and iPods, tweaks enabled or disabled!</p><p>Q: Isn't 230+ tweaks just...too much?<br/>A: Yes, 230+ tweaks might be overwhelming for some
 users on their first jailbreak. Hence, we introduce four 
different tweak packages. The Basic package has ~50 tweaks, Plus has 
~110, Premium has ~180, and Ultimate has 230+. The Basic and Plus packages 
contain some very lightweight, but powerful tweaks such as Activator, 
Browser Changer, ShowCase, and Swipe Selection, which are all tweaks that have very little to no bug problems. 
Additionally, many of the tweaks are behind-the-scenes (such as 
NoAppStoreRedirect), so you won't be too overwhelmed. The Plus and Premium packages have some bulkier tweaks that require some time to get familiar with, but are very useful and time-savers in the long-term. Also, we will allow you to opt-out of tweaks that you might not necessarily want or will ever find use for (such as Twitter++ if you don't tweet) when we do jailbreak your device.<br/></p><p><br/>***2011 iPhone 5 iOS 8.1.2 jailbreak layout seen in the video is HEAVILY inspired by one of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkXk2h_GnO5AAZYk1yhSLpA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iTwe4kz</a>'s Youtube videos!

Youtube!  Squeak's Tweaks, a serviced-based tech company, jailbreaks and 
customizes your iPhone and iPod** for you! We do NOT sell the jailbreak tool; we jailbreak and install ""tweaks"" or customization settings for each jailbreak 
service.**Due to legal considerations, we only jailbreak iPhones and iPods for 
customers until we get a formal debrief from within our own company of the
 18-page Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Then, we can determine what other Apple devices we can legally jailbreak in addition to the 
iPhones and iPods. The debrief will be released for free on all of our social 
media sites, including Indiegogo.Tweak compatibility varies due to iOS version and device model, 
so some tweaks on Cydia, the jailbroken ""App Store"", are not compatible with certain specifications. By selectively 
organizing pre-determined package plans that contain either around 
50, 110, 180, or 230 tweaks, you can essentially save 30+ hours of frustration!Screenshot of our demo jailbroken iPhone!A screenshot can only say so much, so please watch our brief video! We 
present jailbreak in a user-friendly manner that hopefully gives off that ""warm feeling"" that a standard Apple iPhone 
commercial does. We describe all aspects of jailbreak and what makes our 
company unique! Our team is working hard to make Squeak's Tweaks a 
one-stop destination for streamlined jailbreaking. We are working tirelessly on producing more videos that will showcase our services more in depth!For each jailbreak 
service, your Apple device can be shipped to us, jailbroken in a public setting, or in your own 
hands! You have the option to request face-to-face instruction from one 
of our certified jailbreakers through Skype. Our jailbreakers will walk 
you through the steps, providing simple instructions over Skype and 
providing live assistance upon request. We aim to provide you excellent 
customer service! Here's a small graphic summarizing all of it!The money raised from crowdfunding will allow us to buy our website domain, purchase SSL and other needed web certificates, attain a web host, and support our partners in business! In addition to the fees associated with trademark, copyright, and LLC protection, we are pledging portions of our profits in accordance with our mission statement.We aim to revolutionize the jailbreak market not only with a 
user-friendly video presentation, but also with charitable contributions!Click here for a message from our company's founder and CEO Kevin Pang! We emphasize the need for companies to be transparent as possible, so please take a look at our rationale behind all our services and all of our charitable donations!Click here for the 'Girls who Code' website! Additionally,
 we shall use a portion of our raised money to fund other 
start-ups and crowdfunding projects! By helping us out, you are also 
helping out other creators make their dreams come true! :)We will also donate 
(either directly or indirectly due to rigid school 
policies) 5-10% of our 2-week debut profits toward local public high school education 
and other related academic activities, such as the PTA, Model UN, Science Olympaid, etc.We are hoping that our contributions will help Jay Freeman, creator of 
Cydia, significantly reduce the ads, and entice popular developers
 (such as Ryan Petrich) to continue making wonderful tweaks! We are contacting 40+ jailbreak bloggers and 20+ tweak developers 
for their support and for some social media promotion so we may donate 
more funds and grow the jailbreak community substantially!The EFF is now petitioning yet again to renew the exemption in October 
2015, and are most-likely going to be successful. Hopefully, our 
contributions will help them succeed in providing legal protection for 
not only iPhones and iPods, but also iPads, iPad-minis, iPad-airs, etc. In 
addition, before we make this permanent contribution, we request that the EFF back our company, promote us on their website and 
other related social media, and make a statement not only to the 
jailbreak community, but to the public population of the United States 
that we are a legitimate company with good, ethical emphasis on social 
responsibility. Additionally, Apple actually CANNOT sue nor do anything to the 
jailbreak community due to the DCMA exemption. Before the exemption, 
when jailbreak was indeed illegal, Apple has never came close to suing 
for jailbreak, so we are very much protected due to the DCMA and 
(hopefully) EFF.Click here to read an EFF page that describes the 
legality of jailbreak!If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our team here at
 Squeak's Tweaks! Thanks, and we hope to gain all of your support! In all 
due honesty, we need more reputation as opposed to starting capital, 
hence the relatively small project goal. Please donate and/or spread 
word on social media of our company's mission to change the way we think
 of private corporations! THANK YOU!Inquires can be made to our Indiegogo account or at: squeakstweaks@gmail.comOpportunity
 to join company given appropriate qualifications. This includes 
frequent bloggers, Youtubers, tweak developers, and other dedicated 
jailbreak users. You do NOT have to fit into one of those above 
categories. LIMITED 
SPOTS AVAILABLE DUE TO ALREADY LARGE SIZE OF COMPANY!Email us at 
{squeakstweaks@gmail.com}. Include in subject line: Your name, your Indiegogo name, and the words ""EMPLOYMENT REQUEST"". You do not have to
 include a cover letter or resume upon the first email. You may freely 
ask questions and we will answer them before requiring your cover letter
 and/or resume.Hence, we will take high school students (and of course, 
older individuals) with no previous work experience; you just need to 
meet the qualifications and have the appropriate work ethic. Understand we need professionalism and maturity!
Our home page! NOTE: Still in development.

Information about our tweak packages will be very clear and interactive!

Our online payment methods are complete!

We shall have an ""About"" page where we can make personal connections to 
the consumer! Additionally, we are working on a ""Meet the Developers!"" 
page that will give faces to our company!
The biggest challenge that our company faces is simply not having 
enough employees! In essence, we are employing people with certain 
skill-sets for internal function, and training non-specialized people 
how to do step-by-step jailbreak for our customers either in person, at 
our company's headquarters, or over Skype and other forms of online 
communication! Considering how we are tapping into the ENTIRE market of 
iPhones and iPods all over the United States, we 
need many people to do the jailbreaking efficiently and 
quickly!Our training sessions and certification of jailbreakers will 
most definitely be a challenge, especially if we have employees from 
across the country and/or the world! However, we believe that online communication via 
Skype and the prospect of our current company employees going off to colleges around the
 country will allow for us to conveniently orientate new members into our family! We 
shall enforce consistency when it comes to jailbreak procedures by 
producing specific copyrighted instructions for each iOS and device 
model! It will take patience and experience to orientate employees, but with enough diligence and the right work 
ethic, we are sure that we can make a successful business 
model!

For those that cannot watch the video or want quick facts:

Q: Is jailbreak legal in the United States?

<p>As it can be observed, trauma is nowadays
one of the most troublesome problems in any community and also of the most
important causes of morbidities and mortalities.</p>
<p>Trauma can be defined as a bodily harm to
a vital or non-vital organ during an accident. The main objective of the
medical staff and emergency ward in such cases should be preventing from
mortality or morbidity in the injured person.</p>
<p>To save the injured person’s life is one
of the medical principles that should be observed when encountering such a
person. This can be achieved to a great extent by avoiding unnecessary
transferences of the injured one. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451778368/uki05tcoggyp5uvs8mj9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Trauma occurs by several reasons such as:</span><br/></p>
<p>1)<span>  </span>Car accidents  2) Downfall from height  3) Severe industrial traumas  4) Harms caused by sudden deceleration and
similar reasons that exceed the limited space of this section. </p>
<p>Among the
mentioned cases above, the highest figure of morbidities and mortalities
returns to car accidents, having taken this figure from all of the industrialized
and non-industrialized countries.</p>
<p>Medical staff and
emergency ward play an important role in harm reduction and mortality
reduction.  If we intend to deal with the
most important harms caused by trauma, <u>cervical, pectoral, and backbone</u>
traumas of the spinal cord are doubtlessly the most prominent ones. </p>
<p>In severe types
of trauma, harms to spinal column and then to spinal cord are known as the main
complications. </p>
<p>According to the
reports and figures, harms to the spinal cord occur during the following steps:</p>
<p><b>1)<span>  </span>Harms during
accident</b></p>
<p><b>2)<span>  </span>Harms after
accident </b></p>
<p>For example
someone who is harmed by a traumatic injury in his/her car and then gets sudden
extensions while rescuing by emergency staff or common people, will have severe
and irrecoverable harms to the spinal column; a technical flaw or an action
that is done for rescuing purpose, may result in rupture or lesion of the
spinal cord and the injured person will lose his/her ordinary life; for example

</div></div>","As it can be observed, trauma is nowadays
one of the most troublesome problems in any community and also of the most
important causes of morbidities and mortalities.
Trauma can be defined as a bodily harm to
a vital or non-vital organ during an accident. The main objective of the
medical staff and emergency ward in such cases should be preventing from
mortality or morbidity in the injured person.
To save the injured person’s life is one
of the medical principles that should be observed when encountering such a
person. This can be achieved to a great extent by avoiding unnecessary
transferences of the injured one. 


Trauma occurs by several reasons such as:
1)  Car accidents  2) Downfall from height  3) Severe industrial traumas  4) Harms caused by sudden deceleration and
similar reasons that exceed the limited space of this section. 
Among the
mentioned cases above, the highest figure of morbidities and mortalities
returns to car accidents, having taken this figure from all of the industrialized
and non-industrialized countries.
Medical staff and
emergency ward play an important role in harm reduction and mortality
reduction.  If we intend to deal with the
most important harms caused by trauma, cervical, pectoral, and backbone
traumas of the spinal cord are doubtlessly the most prominent ones. 
In severe types
of trauma, harms to spinal column and then to spinal cord are known as the main
complications. 
According to the
reports and figures, harms to the spinal cord occur during the following steps:
1)  Harms during
accident
2)  Harms after
accident 
For example
someone who is harmed by a traumatic injury in his/her car and then gets sudden
extensions while rescuing by emergency staff or common people, will have severe
and irrecoverable harms to the spinal column; a technical flaw or an action
that is done for rescuing purpose, may result in rupture or lesion of the
spinal cord and the injured person will lose his/her ordinary life; for example
fails to walk, control the urination and excretion and many other problems. 



Harms to the
backbone spinal column are numerous and any heaving of them may cause
irrecoverable harms some of which include:
1)  Fracture
2)  Sliding of the spines
on each other because of ligament harms (sub-luxation).
3)   Smashing in the form of compression fracture 
4)  Wedge fracture
5)  Torsion 
In an injured
person with any of these harms, it is naturally impossible to diagnose the kind
of harm before transporting to hospital and taking accurate examinations and
necessary medical imaging.Therefore the
injured rescuing process, placing on the stretcher, transporting to the
hospital, and displacements that take place in the meantime are of a high
significance.Because the
above-mentioned harms are out of sight, the injured person will receive an
again trauma during the rescue and transportation stages; this trauma will
cause irrecoverable harms on the vital organs like spinal cord.

In other words,

it works as a linear flexible fixative that takes form at any angle and

<p>We
understand the emotional toll hair loss can cause. Hence we are determined to
create products which are not only better for us but also provide effective
solutions for hair loss sufferers. We want to give people back their confidence
which one looses during hair loss, especially at younger age. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Hair loss affects people at
various ages for a number of reasons…</b></p>
<p>Thinning hair can be caused by a change in hormones, improper diet,
stress, unhealthy hair habits, genetics, medical conditions, illness, and even
cosmetic procedures such as bleaching or perming hair.</p>
<p>Many people assume hair loss is a problem that primarily affects older
men and even fewer older women, and while there is some truth to that –
generally speaking<i> as you age your rate of hair growth slows</i> – hair
falling out and thinning hair can affect men and women of any
age.

</p>
<p><span>Thinning hair, hair loss, and other hair-related issues can affect
people as young as in their teens and early twenties. Some cannot begin to
imagine what this must be like, as it is discouraging enough to think about
hair loss as we get older, but hair falling out and hair loss at a
young age is more common than you might think. <span>In fact, an estimated 40% of men will have noticeable hair
loss by age 35, and an estimated 40% of women will have visible hair
loss by the time they are 40.</span></span></p>
<p>While hair loss at a young age can be alarming, it’s important to remember
that the earlier thinning hair is noticed and any potential issue is diagnosed,
the easier it may be to treat. The solution may be as simple as replacing
products that cause hair loss with <b>products
that contain natural ingredients and which stimulate hair growth</b>. </p>
<p>Whether or not there is a hair loss cure for your particular
situation, you can discover how to take better care of yourself and your hair
by knowing what to look for early on, and taking preventative measures to help
minimize future damage.</p>
<p><b>What to Look For</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Being aware of your hair’s health and its growth pattern is the first
step to getting ahead of hair loss. </p>
<p>Ask yourself: Are there more strands of hair falling out in
your hair brush than normal? Is there a large amount of hair on your pillow
when you wake up in the morning?</p>
<p><b>Visual cues are a great way to determine if you’re beginning to lose
more hair than normal.</b></p>
<p>You may feel alone if you are experiencing hair loss, but after looking
at statistics, we hope you’ll see that almost everyone is affected by some type
of hair loss in their lifetime.</p>
<p>For women,<b> thinning hair and hair loss affects roughly one
in four women, and 95% of those affected suffer from androgenetic
alopecia. </b>On average, <b>women dealing with hair loss are between
25 and 35 years old. </b>This is a big contrast from the perception that
thinning hair and hair loss is only related to older men and women.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <i>24% of women equate losing hair to losing a limb. </i>This
is how deeply emotional thinning hair and hair loss can be, especially for
women.</p>
<p><b>By the age of 35, 66% of American men will experience some type of hair
loss, and by the age of 50, about 85% of men will have
significantly thinning hair.</b></p>
<p><b>For men with male pattern baldness, 25% will begin to see thinning hair
or hair loss before they reach the age of 21.</b></p>
<p>These numbers prove that hair loss is not just an issue for older men
and women, but in fact affects many men and women in their early twenties and
thirties as well.</p>

<p>One of the challenges at Dushi is to create a larger range. Our fibres
are currently available in 9 different colours and in the future we would also
like to develop a sample pack, a travel pack and accessories to apply the
fibres more efficiently. We have done our research into marketability and
manufacturing of these products and have budgeted accordingly. The funds raised
will go into product development and marketing of these products to the
consumer. </p>
<p>Our aim and vision at Dushi is to prevent or prolong hair loss as much
as possible. Our Shower Hair Care range will prevent hair loss by stimulating
hair growth. The challenge is to create <b>natural</b>
products which are better for us rather than products which contain chemicals
that cause hair loss. We’ve formulated products which are both natural and
stimulate hair growth and your funds will help launch our new range. </p>
<p>Another challenge is to make more people aware of our product and to get
them to discuss thinning hair and hair loss without embarrassment. We would
like to encourage people to offer solutions to each other, like Dushi and to
get people to support our products, not just through Perks but also through a
social media rumble so that we, at Dushi, can offer more products to more
people at a more competitive price each and every time.</p>

<h2>I am completely bald, should I buy Dushi?</h2>
<p>Sorry, no. We do not recommend Dushi to those who are completely 
bald. In addition, Dushi may not work for people with advanced hair loss
 level/class – Norwood scale 7 or Ludwig scale Advanced (basically very 
bald). If you are not sure where you fall on the scale, check with your 
Salon professional.</p>
<h2>What about a large scar on the scalp?</h2>
<p>If your scar is more than 2 inch in diameter, and it is shiny (no hair whatsoever),  we do not recommend this product. Sorry.</p>
<h2>Who is the typical candidate for Dushi?</h2>
<p>Early this year, we sent out 600 surveys to our customers who 
volunteered to participate. The survey asked them if they were satisfied
 with the performance of Dushi and collected information about their 
age, gender, hair loss levels based on Ludwig or Norwood scale. Here are
 the results:</p>
<p><strong>Men</strong> (breakdown by Norwood Scale)</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447939409/t7bqv0pktzcs4iuecoay.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Women</strong> (breakdown by Ludwig Scale)</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447939439/zifogbhkbavxgbpkuqzl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>As you can see, if you are completely bald or have a large bald spot 
where there is little hair left, you should NOT try this product.
<p>But if the thinning area on your scalp still has reasonable amount of hair, Dushi will do wonders for you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Can others tell I am using Dushi?</h2>
<p>If your hair loss level has not reached Norwood scale 7 or Ludwig 
scale Advanced (see below), Dushi will instantly eliminate the bald spot
 and the appearance of thinning hair, your hair will look completely 
natural, undetectable, even from close up, outdoor and under bright 
light.</p>
<p>Dushi is not the typical hair loss products (paint-like or shoe 
polish-like) you normally see on the mass market that were invented in 
the 80s of last century. Dushi is a new, breakthrough product that 
quickly became a staple among professionals in theatrical and movie 
industry.</p>
<p>Professionals love Dushi because it is HD-movie-camera-proof:  high 
definition cinematic camera can capture pores or small wrinkles on an 
actor/actress’s face, however it can not tell natural hair from hair 
enhanced with Dushi.</p>
<h2>Can I use Dushi by myself?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can put Dushi on the scalp yourself by standing in front of a mirror.</p>
<h2>Can Dushi be used with any hair type or any hairstyle?</h2>
<p>Dushi works for any hair type, ranging from normal coarser hair to 
vellus hair (fine, non-pigmented hair, often called “peach fuzz”) and 
everything in between. Dushi application is flexible to accommodate any 
hair style including shaved, short, long, curly, kinky, wavy, braided, 
frizzy, straight, colored, highlighted or frosted hair.</p>
<h2>How long does it take to apply Dushi?</h2>
<p>It varies, from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size
 of thinning area and your skill level. You will get better at applying 
Dushi after a few uses.</p>
<h2>What is the minimum hair length for it to work?</h2>
<p>For best results, we recommend 0.5 inch (1 -2 cm) or longer. Dushi 
will NOT work on shaved head, use it after your hair grows out.</p>
<h2>Will Dushi fall out?</h2>
<p>Not if you follow the instructions (come with the product) and apply 
correctly. Dushi bonds to your hair 200% more secure than any other 
fiber based thickening products on the mass market. It better withstands
 wind, sweat and rain.</p>
<h2>Does Dushi stain?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not. Dushi fibers are 100% colorfast, it will never stain 
clothes, bed linen or your scalp. If the fibres accidentally drop onto a
 surface, simply dust them off.</p>
<h2>Can I comb my hair after applying Dushi?</h2>
<p>Yes. For best results, you should dry and style your hair before 
applying Dushi. However you can still comb your hair afterwards, just 
use a wide toothed comb. It is more for shaping than fine grooming. You 
can also use your hand and fingers to pat their style into place.</p>
<h2>How long does one application last?</h2>
<p>Each application can last for days until you decide to remove it by shampooing your hair.</p>
<h2>Do I need special shampoo to remove Dushi?</h2>
<p>No. You can use regular shampoo.</p>
<h2>How long does one bottle of Dushi last?</h2>
<p>Depending on the size of the thinning area, the 25 Gram size last approximately 50 – 75 days.</p>
<h2>How do I use Dushi and Minoxidil at the same time?</h2>
<p>Apply Minoxidil (or any topical treatment) first, wait for your scalp to dry completely and then apply Dushi.</p>
<h2>What about Propecia? Can I continue to take it while using Dushi?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. Dushi does not interfere with Propecia whatsoever.</p>
<h2>Can I use hairspray, hair gels or hair oil?</h2>
<p>Hairspray – use it AFTER Dushi.</p>
<p>Hair gels – wait for hair gel to dry BEFORE applying Dushi.</p>
<p>Hair Oils – It depends on types of hair oil. You can experiment. If you do, use hair oil BEFORE using Dushi.</p>
<h2>Does Dushi change normal hair growth pattern?</h2>
<p>No. Dushi is not a medicine or drug, it consists of natural fibres 
extracted from plants, it does not promote or slow down normal hair 
growth.</p>
<h2>Does it work for women?</h2>
<p>Dushi is equally effective for women as for men. In fact, 
approximately 30% of our customers are female. Check out the video demo 
for women.</p>
<h2>Does Dushi work for facial hair and eyebrows?</h2>
<p>Yes, many salon professionals and makeup artists also use Dushi to give eyebrows a more fuller and natural look.</p>
<h2>How many colors are there?</h2>
<p>Dushi offers nine colors. One of them will match your hair color.</p>
<h2>How to choose a color for my hair?</h2>
<p>(1) Look in the mirror. Look at your hair root color in the thinning area. This is the color to order.<br/>
(2) If you have highlighted ends with darker roots, match the root color.<br/>
(3) When in doubt, choose the darker shade. For example if you have 
trouble deciding between medium brown and light brown, choose medium 
brown.</p>
<h2>Can I mix two colors, how?</h2>
<p>Yes. Follow the following steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Apply a thin layer of darker shade Dushi, lightly pat your hair to disperse the product, and then</p>
<p>Step 2: apply the lighter shade Dushi, again gently pat your hair to disperse the product.</p>
<p>Step 3: Repeat step 1 and 2 if necessary to get the desired coverage.</p>
<h2>Can I use a curling iron or hair straightener with this product?</h2>
<p>Yes, but you should use styling iron first before applying Dushi.</p>

Just over a year ago, while travelling in Morocco, he came across a fascinating
product. The product was hair building fibres made from a plant that grows only in the arid regions of
Morocco, which the locals were using to conceal their
hair loss area. He decided to
introduce this amazing product to the world and help millions of people
suffering from hair loss, Alopecia and other hair loss conditions.

paint"" nor ""shoe polish"". It is like nothing you have used

Instantly eliminates bald spots or appearance of thinning hair. 

Gives you a perfectly natural look.

We
understand the emotional toll hair loss can cause. Hence we are determined to
create products which are not only better for us but also provide effective
solutions for hair loss sufferers. We want to give people back their confidence
which one looses during hair loss, especially at younger age. 

Hair loss affects people at
various ages for a number of reasons…
Thinning hair can be caused by a change in hormones, improper diet,
stress, unhealthy hair habits, genetics, medical conditions, illness, and even
cosmetic procedures such as bleaching or perming hair.
Many people assume hair loss is a problem that primarily affects older
men and even fewer older women, and while there is some truth to that –
generally speaking as you age your rate of hair growth slows – hair
falling out and thinning hair can affect men and women of any
age.


Thinning hair, hair loss, and other hair-related issues can affect
people as young as in their teens and early twenties. Some cannot begin to
imagine what this must be like, as it is discouraging enough to think about
hair loss as we get older, but hair falling out and hair loss at a
young age is more common than you might think. In fact, an estimated 40% of men will have noticeable hair
loss by age 35, and an estimated 40% of women will have visible hair
loss by the time they are 40.
While hair loss at a young age can be alarming, it’s important to remember
that the earlier thinning hair is noticed and any potential issue is diagnosed,
the easier it may be to treat. The solution may be as simple as replacing
products that cause hair loss with products
that contain natural ingredients and which stimulate hair growth. 
Whether or not there is a hair loss cure for your particular
situation, you can discover how to take better care of yourself and your hair
by knowing what to look for early on, and taking preventative measures to help
minimize future damage.
What to Look For

Being aware of your hair’s health and its growth pattern is the first
step to getting ahead of hair loss. 
Ask yourself: Are there more strands of hair falling out in
your hair brush than normal? Is there a large amount of hair on your pillow
when you wake up in the morning?
Visual cues are a great way to determine if you’re beginning to lose
more hair than normal.
You may feel alone if you are experiencing hair loss, but after looking
at statistics, we hope you’ll see that almost everyone is affected by some type
of hair loss in their lifetime.
For women, thinning hair and hair loss affects roughly one
in four women, and 95% of those affected suffer from androgenetic
alopecia. On average, women dealing with hair loss are between
25 and 35 years old. This is a big contrast from the perception that
thinning hair and hair loss is only related to older men and women.
Furthermore, 24% of women equate losing hair to losing a limb. This
is how deeply emotional thinning hair and hair loss can be, especially for
women.
By the age of 35, 66% of American men will experience some type of hair
loss, and by the age of 50, about 85% of men will have
significantly thinning hair.
For men with male pattern baldness, 25% will begin to see thinning hair
or hair loss before they reach the age of 21.
These numbers prove that hair loss is not just an issue for older men
and women, but in fact affects many men and women in their early twenties and
thirties as well.



 

One of the challenges at Dushi is to create a larger range. Our fibres
are currently available in 9 different colours and in the future we would also
like to develop a sample pack, a travel pack and accessories to apply the
fibres more efficiently. We have done our research into marketability and
manufacturing of these products and have budgeted accordingly. The funds raised
will go into product development and marketing of these products to the
consumer. 
Our aim and vision at Dushi is to prevent or prolong hair loss as much
as possible. Our Shower Hair Care range will prevent hair loss by stimulating
hair growth. The challenge is to create natural
products which are better for us rather than products which contain chemicals
that cause hair loss. We’ve formulated products which are both natural and
stimulate hair growth and your funds will help launch our new range. 
Another challenge is to make more people aware of our product and to get
them to discuss thinning hair and hair loss without embarrassment. We would
like to encourage people to offer solutions to each other, like Dushi and to
get people to support our products, not just through Perks but also through a
social media rumble so that we, at Dushi, can offer more products to more
people at a more competitive price each and every time.

What People Are Saying.Fantastic product, been using it for 3 months and love the results! - Jamie from MelbourneMy hair is thinning but Dushi gave it more volume and thickness. Highly recommend it.- Elizabeth from Sydney





I am completely bald, should I buy Dushi?
Sorry, no. We do not recommend Dushi to those who are completely 
bald. In addition, Dushi may not work for people with advanced hair loss
 level/class – Norwood scale 7 or Ludwig scale Advanced (basically very 
bald). If you are not sure where you fall on the scale, check with your 
Salon professional.
What about a large scar on the scalp?
If your scar is more than 2 inch in diameter, and it is shiny (no hair whatsoever),  we do not recommend this product. Sorry.
Who is the typical candidate for Dushi?
Early this year, we sent out 600 surveys to our customers who 
volunteered to participate. The survey asked them if they were satisfied
 with the performance of Dushi and collected information about their 
age, gender, hair loss levels based on Ludwig or Norwood scale. Here are
 the results:
Men (breakdown by Norwood Scale)




Women (breakdown by Ludwig Scale)

As you can see, if you are completely bald or have a large bald spot 
where there is little hair left, you should NOT try this product.
But if the thinning area on your scalp still has reasonable amount of hair, Dushi will do wonders for you.

Can others tell I am using Dushi?
If your hair loss level has not reached Norwood scale 7 or Ludwig 
scale Advanced (see below), Dushi will instantly eliminate the bald spot
 and the appearance of thinning hair, your hair will look completely 
natural, undetectable, even from close up, outdoor and under bright 
light.
Dushi is not the typical hair loss products (paint-like or shoe 
polish-like) you normally see on the mass market that were invented in 
the 80s of last century. Dushi is a new, breakthrough product that 
quickly became a staple among professionals in theatrical and movie 
industry.
Professionals love Dushi because it is HD-movie-camera-proof:  high 
definition cinematic camera can capture pores or small wrinkles on an 
actor/actress’s face, however it can not tell natural hair from hair 
enhanced with Dushi.
Can I use Dushi by myself?
Yes, you can put Dushi on the scalp yourself by standing in front of a mirror.
Can Dushi be used with any hair type or any hairstyle?
Dushi works for any hair type, ranging from normal coarser hair to 
vellus hair (fine, non-pigmented hair, often called “peach fuzz”) and 
everything in between. Dushi application is flexible to accommodate any 
hair style including shaved, short, long, curly, kinky, wavy, braided, 
frizzy, straight, colored, highlighted or frosted hair.
How long does it take to apply Dushi?
It varies, from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size
 of thinning area and your skill level. You will get better at applying 
Dushi after a few uses.
What is the minimum hair length for it to work?
For best results, we recommend 0.5 inch (1 -2 cm) or longer. Dushi 
will NOT work on shaved head, use it after your hair grows out.
Will Dushi fall out?
Not if you follow the instructions (come with the product) and apply 
correctly. Dushi bonds to your hair 200% more secure than any other 
fiber based thickening products on the mass market. It better withstands
 wind, sweat and rain.
Does Dushi stain?
Absolutely not. Dushi fibers are 100% colorfast, it will never stain 
clothes, bed linen or your scalp. If the fibres accidentally drop onto a
 surface, simply dust them off.
Can I comb my hair after applying Dushi?
Yes. For best results, you should dry and style your hair before 
applying Dushi. However you can still comb your hair afterwards, just 
use a wide toothed comb. It is more for shaping than fine grooming. You 
can also use your hand and fingers to pat their style into place.
How long does one application last?
Each application can last for days until you decide to remove it by shampooing your hair.
Do I need special shampoo to remove Dushi?
No. You can use regular shampoo.
How long does one bottle of Dushi last?
Depending on the size of the thinning area, the 25 Gram size last approximately 50 – 75 days.
How do I use Dushi and Minoxidil at the same time?
Apply Minoxidil (or any topical treatment) first, wait for your scalp to dry completely and then apply Dushi.
What about Propecia? Can I continue to take it while using Dushi?
Absolutely. Dushi does not interfere with Propecia whatsoever.
Can I use hairspray, hair gels or hair oil?
Hairspray – use it AFTER Dushi.
Hair gels – wait for hair gel to dry BEFORE applying Dushi.
Hair Oils – It depends on types of hair oil. You can experiment. If you do, use hair oil BEFORE using Dushi.
Does Dushi change normal hair growth pattern?
No. Dushi is not a medicine or drug, it consists of natural fibres 
extracted from plants, it does not promote or slow down normal hair 
growth.
Does it work for women?
Dushi is equally effective for women as for men. In fact, 
approximately 30% of our customers are female. Check out the video demo 
for women.
Does Dushi work for facial hair and eyebrows?
Yes, many salon professionals and makeup artists also use Dushi to give eyebrows a more fuller and natural look.
How many colors are there?
Dushi offers nine colors. One of them will match your hair color.
How to choose a color for my hair?
(1) Look in the mirror. Look at your hair root color in the thinning area. This is the color to order.
(2) If you have highlighted ends with darker roots, match the root color.
(3) When in doubt, choose the darker shade. For example if you have 
trouble deciding between medium brown and light brown, choose medium 
brown.
Can I mix two colors, how?
Yes. Follow the following steps:
Step 1: Apply a thin layer of darker shade Dushi, lightly pat your hair to disperse the product, and then
Step 2: apply the lighter shade Dushi, again gently pat your hair to disperse the product.
Step 3: Repeat step 1 and 2 if necessary to get the desired coverage.
Can I use a curling iron or hair straightener with this product?
Yes, but you should use styling iron first before applying Dushi.",26.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><b>The Short Version<br/><br/></b>My name is Cori MacNaughton-Rzeczkowska, aka Cori MacNaughton, and, with my husband, Marek Rzeczkowski, we have developed a small, <b>structured water unit</b> that is easily portable, easy to use, requires no filters or ongoing maintenance, and is more affordable than most of the structured water units currently on the market.  <br/><br/>We already have  working prototypes, and are ready to incorporate significant improvements into our first production units, which we plan to begin shipping the first week in June.<br/><br/>Because we strongly believe that <b>everyone has the right to clean, healthy water</b>, and because we believe that structured water is a huge step in the right direction, for every unit that is claimed through our campaign, <b>we pledge to donate another unit to a person or family who is in need</b>.  <br/><br/>Further, once the campaign is finished and we go live, <b>we pledge to continue giving at least one unit to a person or family in need for every unit sold through our website</b>.  There is a reason that we chose ""dot org"" for our website, rather than ""dot com"" or ""dot net,"" because we intend for our for-profit business to have a fully <b>non-profit division</b>, to help to get this technology and knowledge out there, to make it better known, and to improve peoples' lives.<br/><br/>So in short, you can help our company get off the ground and <b>complete our first production run</b>, and hopefully provide some local jobs, while doing good for someone else at the same time, taking control of your own water supply, and potentially even improving your own health.  <br/><br/>In the process, you can help us by <b>suggesting features and improvements</b> that we can incorporate into future units down the road.  Sounds like a win/win to me.<br/><br/>My personal <b>goal is to donate 10,000 structured water units to people in

Our water.  <br/><br/>The water that belongs, rightfully, to each and every one
of us.  <br/><br/>Water is life, literally.  Without access to clean, pure
water, we die within days, along with all other life on our planet. 
Life, as we know it on Earth, cannot exist in the absence of water.</p>
<p>Between transport, sewage, dumping and
other pollution, we humans have been trashing our waterways for
literally thousands of years.</p>
<p><b>Have we improved things with
technology? </b>
</p>
<p>Not so far.</p>
<p>In fact, in the past twenty years and
more, huge multinational companies have been buying up water rights
to potable water all over the world, from Third World countries to
right here in America, only to deny access to the local people who
had depended on it for centuries; or even for thousands of years. 
<br/><br/><b>Yes, Nestlé, we're looking at you.</b></p>
<p>Toxic chemicals such as chlorine and
chloramines are commonly put in public water supplies in order to
make the water safer, by killing bacteria and viruses, but at what
cost?  Fluoride is commonly added in the United States, even though
it is banned in most countries, in a misguided effort to prevent
dental cavities, even though research consistently shows that
fluoridated water not only does not prevent cavities, but causes a
whole host of health issues, including increased osteoporosis, and lowered IQs in children.<br/><br/>Much of the freshwater in this country, and around the world, has been contaminated with mercury, lead, E. coli,  prescription drugs including anti-depressants and birth control pills and much more, and our water treatment plants are not removing much of this contamination.<br/><br/>Treated
water in plastic water bottles is not the answer, either, as they are
not only one of our most common and widespread forms of solid waste
pollution, but the longer the water is in a plastic bottle, especially when
exposed to heat such as in a hot car, the more toxic chemicals are
leached directly into the water.</p>
<p><b>There has to be a better way</b>.  <br/><br/>And
there is.  Things are changing, and we want to help bring about that
change.  And we want to do that by making structured water much more
widely available, starting with our basic structured water unit, and
moving onward from there.<br/><br/><b>Structured Water is Not New –
Nature Has Been Doing it This Way All Along</b><br/><br/>Structured
water, or ordered water, was discovered by Sir William Hardy, a
British physical chemist, over a century ago.  He revealed evidence of a
fourth phase of water, in-between the known phases of liquid and solid
(ice), and realizing the potential importance of his discovery, he
published his findings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a century ago, the
technology to prove his theory did not yet exist, and much like
Galileo and Copernicus before him, he was ridiculed, and his theory was passed
off as absurd.  But a few scientists took notice and, over the years, began on their own to test his
theory.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Gerald Pollack and the Fourth
Phase of Water</b><br/><br/>One of the most prominent is Dr. Gerald H.
Pollack, Professor of Bioengineering and head of Pollack Laboratory,
at the University of Washington in Seattle.   <br/><br/>Many years ago, Dr.
Pollack and his staff began a study of how muscles contract, a simple
concept you would think was already well known to medical science,
but it is not.  In consulting the published literature, Dr. Pollack
realized that although our bodies consist of roughly 70% water by
volume, none of the scientific literature took the water into account
when describing the functioning of the body, its cells, organs or muscles.</p>
<p>This is even stranger once you realize
that, due to how large some of our molecules are, such as proteins, and how
tiny water molecules are by comparison, fully 99% of our bodies'
molecules are water.  So, for biology, medicine, chemistry and other
physical sciences to completely ignore the presence of water when determining
the functioning of our bodies, with the knowledge that 99% of the molecules in
our bodies are water molecules, seems ridiculous, if not outright insane.</p>
<p><b>Could this be why modern medicine is
so terrible at keeping people healthy?</b></p>
<p>Dr. Pollack and his staff, following in
the footsteps of Sir William Hardy, confirmed that there is indeed a
fourth phase of water, with chemical and physical characteristics all
its own, and he published their findings not only in scientific
journals, but also in his 2013 book, ""The Fourth Phase of
Water,"" which is written for the general public.  
</p>
<p>In one of  his lectures on YouTube, Dr.
Pollack states that one of the reasons why so many scientists still
don't acknowledge a fourth phase of water, despite overwhelming
evidence, is that the theory is too simple.  It has been right in
front of us all along, and yet we have missed it completely, for
literally thousands of years.</p>
<p><b>So what does structured water mean
to you and me?</b> <br/><br/>Quite simply, although structuring water
neither adds anything nor takes anything away from water, it changes
the structure of the water in a way that better hydrates the body and
its tissues.  According to Dr. Pollack, the primary feature of
structured water is that it profoundly excludes soluble chemicals and
particulate matter on a molecular level, which is why he generally
refers to it as EZ (Exclusion Zone) water.</p>
<p>According to some sources, this means
that by structuring the water, it surrounds any contaminants in the
water, thus making them unavailable to the body.  
</p>
<p>Still other sources suggest that the
structured water, which is energized through structuring, is
intelligent, and gives the human body precisely what it needs; in
other words, it will allow the body to absorb needed minerals from the
water, while excluding chemical contaminants and pathogens.</p>
<p>Naturally these claims are difficult,
if not impossible to test for, although there is years of anecdotal
evidence that peoples' health generally improves when drinking
structured water.  Some claim to have reversed obesity, or even gone into remission from
cancer, and other serious health ailments, just by
drinking structured water.</p>
<p><b>I don't personally know if these
claims are accurate, nor do I make any health claims for these units,
because I am not a doctor or medical professional, and it is illegal
for me to do so.  </b>
</p>
<p>I can say that I personally feel better
hydrated since I started drinking structured water.  The first thing I
noticed, aside from the fact that the water feels wetter, was that my
eyes no longer felt dry.  I have been wearing contacts since my
mid-twenties, so for me, this is huge. 
</p>
<p>My husband has also felt a difference,
and since I started giving it to our animals, their fur has become
noticeably softer and more silky to the touch.</p>
<p>I have also noticed a difference in my
plants, and I'll be doing some side by side comparisons in growing
sprouts and microgreens with structured water versus regular water. <br/><br/>
I've already started side by side comparisons in brewing water kefir
and kombucha; if you send us an email, and I'll keep you posted on the
results, as well as keeping you in the loop on any more information I
am able to uncover.<br/><br/><b>So who are we and why are we doing
this?</b></p>
<p>My name is Cori
MacNaughton-Rzeczkowska, aka <b>Cori MacNaughton</b>, and I've been learning
about and paying attention to water for decades; first when I majored
in Marine Biology in college, and later when I worked for a company
that sold five-stage electrostatic water filters.  <br/><br/>Growing up in the
Desert Southwest, I was already well aware of the importance of water in the
environment, and years later, I was reminded again while living in
Florida, when a several-year-drought literally caused Green Swamp
near our home in the Tampa Bay area to dry up almost completely. 
<br/><br/>In addition to owning and operating my own art and framing studio in Florida for
several years, I spent many years building unique and amazing
aquariums with my former husband, an avid inventor, and learned a great
deal about physically working with water, plumbing and dental fittings and hydraulic pressure in the process. <br/><br/>
I am a longtime sailor and SCUBA diver, and having dealt with restricted water supplies on a small sailboat, particularly on long trips, it inspired me to write an article
about some of the many ways of ensuring a safe and healthy water
supply in the event of contamination from a hurricane or other
disaster, following our brushes with Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Jeanne and Ivan in 2004.  <br/><br/>Finally, I have earned Beginning and Advanced Certificates in Aquaponics, which is the marriage of aquaculture and
hydroponics, or growing fish and vegetables  together in a
closed-loop system, which I firmly believe will revolutionize
agriculture as it is more widely adopted.  Oh boy . . . more plumbing fittings!  ;-)<br/><br/> All of these experiences and more have made me excited and passionate about structured water, what it can do for people and our planet, and the urgency of getting it into the hands of as many people as I possibly can.<br/><br/>My husband, <b>Marek
Rzeczkowski</b>, has a different perspective, having grown
up in Poland, where he frequently went fishing with his father.  Like
me, he is happiest on the water, and like me, he has been frustrated
with the usual options for making chemically-treated water safer, tastier and
more enjoyable to drink.  <br/><br/>Although <b>Marek</b> doesn't have as extensive a
background in working with water as I do, he has also owned and operated
several businesses, and has an amazing work ethic.   It was his idea, in fact, for us to take the research I had been doing to develop the prototypes, and turn this into an actual business.  He knows what it
takes to start and grow a business, and is every bit as passionate and committed as
I am to seeing this venture through.  <br/><br/><br/>

<p><b>How I feel in love with Athletic Training (Fitness)</b></p>
<p>Growing up I wasn't the most athletic of my peers, I was a tall chubby kid in the early years of my life. In middle school, I was the tallest kid there and would be frustrated looking at the shorter (thinner)kids as they were dunking the basketball (me not being able to touch the rim) and out running me in races. Well I decided I wasn't going to be the slow, chubby, non-athletic kid ANYMORE! So started saving the money I made from my candy selling business and purchased me a pair of Jumpsoles. That following summer leading into my 8th grade year I worked out in those jumpsoles 4 days a week and on my rest days I would still walk around with them on. I was hoping doing that would give me an extra boost. Needless to say I wasn't dunking going into my 8th grade year but I was grabbing the rim on a constantly basis. Though that was cool to me, I wasn't going to stop until I was able to dunk. Though out the school year I would still workout in my jumpsoles. Some morning I would wake up at 5:30 am and sprint the hills of my neighborhood. Honestly I believe that is where I started to develop a love for working out (fitness). It was clear what my goal was, but the process is what I feel in love with. Seeing improvement, jumping higher, getting stronger, running faster, seeing muscles beginning to develop in my legs. By the way, my 1st dunk was during a basketball game and the crowd went CRAZY!!!</p>
<p><b>Fast Forward</b> </p>
<p>After playing college and some international basketball I'm now the #1 Basketball Skills Trainer in the state of Alabama. (According to <a href=""https://www.coachup.com/searches/coaches/andersonj?r=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">coachup</a>.com) I take my love for fitness and knowledge for basketball, apply the two and do what I can to help serve others.

</ul>
<p><b>About David:</b></p>
<p>David Sye, a yoga elder, developed a healing method called YogaBeats. His mission is to train teachers and students living in conflict areas to spread the peaceful method and message of yoga and to bring about change in those communities. Through his work, he is showing communities that yoga can be a tool for social change. Since 1995 he has been working with diverse groups using YogaBeats as a means to break down barriers and change perceptions.   </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">‘Whether this means drugs, crime or war, Yoga is 100% effective in empowering and transforming lives and circumstances into joy and happiness. Collectively this is the only way that we can achieve change that lasts within our communities.’ - David Sye</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>About Sama:</b><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b></b></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>When David Sye invited me to join him in Palestine in November 2013 for a teaching tour, I immediately sensed the potential of this work.We travelled tirelessly for 10 days to a number of places across Palestinian territories. The experience revealed a desire from the local people to understand other ways of remaining sane and healthy, and a sensing that learning from different cultures helps us understand ours better and offers a way forward out of dualistic and confrontational perspectives that can only lead to more conflict and more suffering. </p>This past May, I have celebrated my 30th year of teaching Yoga.Yoga came into my life serendipitously as I was serving a 3 months jail sentence in Amsterdam. When I was released there was nothing for me to hold onto but these few postures and a short meditation practice. I held onto these with my heart and soul, deeply sensing that this was my way out.This was going to see me through...and it did.Yoga has a way of keeping its promise, if in turn you keep your commitment. <p></p>
<p>I was given an opportunity then and today I have the humbling work of giving opportunities to many. When in Palestine with David, I saw so much energy, desire, intelligence, generosity and heart. I also saw much confusion, disorientation and suffering. Today is the time to share this wondrous thing we call Yoga to a new generation of people who can themselves offer a new opportunity to their people. </p>
<p>The Yoga Beats Conflict foundation course in Yoga teaching represents an invaluable resource for Palestinian trainees. It will give them the inner understanding to withstand the difficult external circumstances in which they will be operating asYogaTeachers. They will gain experience in delivering safe, precise and intelligent guidance to help people deal with the effects of living under siege. Yoga is a path of freedom, this is what both myself and David are committed to pass on. This is our message, our motivation for setting up this new project. </p>

<p>So the impulse is there, but the financial means are scarce and we need your support to bring over some of these students. We hope to be able to pay for their visas and flights to Spain’s Islas Canarias, where a wonderful couple running a Yoga Centre there have offered us a free of charge stay for the group and teachers. Of course there will be many overheads to cover. Neither myself nor David or his assistants will receive a teaching fee. We are giving for free our expertise and experience as Yoga Elders with over 50 years of Yoga teaching between the two of us. And we need your help to make this happen. Please give as little or as much as is available to you, your company, your business. Thank you! </p>

<p>This year, Yoga Beats Conflict continues its work with a further project to introduce the foundations of Yoga teaching to a group of 25+ Palestinian women and men who would like to be able to offer Yoga in their respective communities.They come from different backgrounds including sports, education, social welfare, journalism and the arts. Whether working people or housewives they all have a profound desire to be of service to their communities in a way that is innovative, creative and challenging and also that can potentially bring solace, inner peace and healing to a people deeply traumatised by years of conflict and war. </p>
<p>These aspiring Yoga teachers are all committed to learn and experience the benefits of Yoga and return home to support a new vision, a new way of seeing. A refreshing method to connect with the deeper layers of our organic and spiritual reality in order to give a fresh voice to the soul of their people, especially the younger generations. </p>
<p>The retreat, accommodation and meals have been donated to Yogabeats Conflict project, free of charge by Azul Fit, so we are now looking to fund all other associated costs to make this foundation course training possible for these students. <br/></p>

</div></div>","We need your support to fund safe passage and airfares, for 25+ Yoga Teachers from war zones. Here these teachers can complete their training in a safe environment free from the terror, noise and pressure of war. These students can then return and teach yoga, as a way to bring together opposing communities and start the process of positive change.Peace is possible, but we are going up against vast forces, forces that do not want change. We need to show the world that love matters and that change is possible.Choose love, choose peace!""I have started doing yoga since 2 years,  I want to participate in this yoga training  with David, the amazing teacher who helped us to think positively. Moreover, yoga helps me a lot to find  my  inner peace and to reduce my daily stress, and let me be positive, love people more, love my community even we are living in the most conflict place “ Palestine “   helping  me to find the  happiness, and appreciate what I have !   
I’m a trainer, I  have provided and will provide  training  (conflict resolution, stress management, self-esteem…)  to the most marginalized women in our community who suffered from a big stress, poverty and lack of  self-esteem, I have used yoga to help them  to  think positively to their self and in to  the world around them and I succeed in many cases. The training will provide with more skills to work with these marginalized  women and to have a chance to change their lives positively. Thanks for giving me the chance. ""
 
 
Why donate to YogaBeats Conflict? If you have ever experienced yoga, the you will understand its incredible power of positive change.
Its time to see beyond what we can take from yoga and to share our practice and give something back.
For the first time in YogaBeats history, we will help students travel from conflict areas that we are not able to access and bring them to a safe place to learn from  David Sye & Sama Fabian, internationally renowned Yoga Teachers. 


In November 2015, we will bring together 25+ students to complete their yoga teacher training in the safe haven of Fuerteventura at Azul Fit. 
Yogabeats Conflict is the premier yoga form for Conflict Resolution available in the world today.  This non-profit work is recognised by his Holiness the Dalai Lama.  
From your donation, we can train this group of 25 students living in conflict areas so they can bring this powerful, healing method back to their communities.  'One soul brought into the light potentially alters the entire destiny of the species.'

About David:
David Sye, a yoga elder, developed a healing method called YogaBeats. His mission is to train teachers and students living in conflict areas to spread the peaceful method and message of yoga and to bring about change in those communities. Through his work, he is showing communities that yoga can be a tool for social change. Since 1995 he has been working with diverse groups using YogaBeats as a means to break down barriers and change perceptions.   
‘Whether this means drugs, crime or war, Yoga is 100% effective in empowering and transforming lives and circumstances into joy and happiness. Collectively this is the only way that we can achieve change that lasts within our communities.’ - David Sye
About Sama:


When David Sye invited me to join him in Palestine in November 2013 for a teaching tour, I immediately sensed the potential of this work.We travelled tirelessly for 10 days to a number of places across Palestinian territories. The experience revealed a desire from the local people to understand other ways of remaining sane and healthy, and a sensing that learning from different cultures helps us understand ours better and offers a way forward out of dualistic and confrontational perspectives that can only lead to more conflict and more suffering. This past May, I have celebrated my 30th year of teaching Yoga.Yoga came into my life serendipitously as I was serving a 3 months jail sentence in Amsterdam. When I was released there was nothing for me to hold onto but these few postures and a short meditation practice. I held onto these with my heart and soul, deeply sensing that this was my way out.This was going to see me through...and it did.Yoga has a way of keeping its promise, if in turn you keep your commitment. 
I was given an opportunity then and today I have the humbling work of giving opportunities to many. When in Palestine with David, I saw so much energy, desire, intelligence, generosity and heart. I also saw much confusion, disorientation and suffering. Today is the time to share this wondrous thing we call Yoga to a new generation of people who can themselves offer a new opportunity to their people. 
The Yoga Beats Conflict foundation course in Yoga teaching represents an invaluable resource for Palestinian trainees. It will give them the inner understanding to withstand the difficult external circumstances in which they will be operating asYogaTeachers. They will gain experience in delivering safe, precise and intelligent guidance to help people deal with the effects of living under siege. Yoga is a path of freedom, this is what both myself and David are committed to pass on. This is our message, our motivation for setting up this new project. 

So the impulse is there, but the financial means are scarce and we need your support to bring over some of these students. We hope to be able to pay for their visas and flights to Spain’s Islas Canarias, where a wonderful couple running a Yoga Centre there have offered us a free of charge stay for the group and teachers. Of course there will be many overheads to cover. Neither myself nor David or his assistants will receive a teaching fee. We are giving for free our expertise and experience as Yoga Elders with over 50 years of Yoga teaching between the two of us. And we need your help to make this happen. Please give as little or as much as is available to you, your company, your business. Thank you!

My name is Emily Anton, I am a freelance professional ballet dancer living in New York City. <a href=""http://emilyanton.com/dancer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I dance</a><a href=""http://emilyanton.com/dancer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>, <a href=""http://emilyanton.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I write</a> and I am the owner and sole proprietor of a beautiful <a href=""http://emilyanton.com/holistichealthcarepractice/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">holistic healthcare business</a>.  Mainly, I just want to share my gifts with the world in whatever way I can and am called to do with so much joy, love and grace.  My life's goal is to make the ballet world a healthier and happier place for dancers.   </p>
<p>My junior year of high school I answered the call to become a professional ballet dancer and despite many, many, many rejections I did just that 3 years later.  </p>
<p>A year later, I answered the call to move to NYC - buying myself a one-way plane ticket, packing up two suitcases and moving across the country from California to NYC (in the middle of winter 2011).  </p>
<p>During my first year in NYC, I completed the Franklin Method year one teacher training.  I  work studied my way through the training, all while living, dancing and audtioning in New York City.  Also, I workstudied my way to two trainings in BodyTalk Access that same year.  </p>
<p>In 2012, craving more education and figuring I might as well finish the Bachelors degree I was already 3 years invested into (at 4 different universities!) - I enrolled at Empire State College (SUNY).  After 2 years of independant studies, blood, sweat, tears and lots of times I wanted to give up - I graduated with my BA in Dance and Movement Studies in 2014.  </p>
<p>Also in 2012, I started dancing professionally for the NYC-based <a href=""http://www.balletswithatwist.com/dancers/emily-anton"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ballets with a Twist </a>(who I still dance with to this day). </p>
<p>Always loving and seeing the power of the BodyTalk System, in the fall of 2014 I took an intensive training in BodyTalk to further expand my knowledge base.  This was of course in addition to performing ballets (as a freelance dancer) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina as well as Grants Pass, Oregon. </p>
<p>Then 2015 hit and I decided that this would be the year my business would be a success and I would <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">help performing artists and other creatively-inclined individuals access the brilliant health of their bodies through my knowledge of the Franklin Method, dance, movement, anatomy, kinesiology, the BodyTalk System and my own continuous studies in this field. </span></p>
<p>And yet - the universe/God had bigger plans for me and so in 2015, I answered the strong calling to pursue the Hellerwork Structural Integration training, applied and was accepted!  </p>
<p>This training is giving my holistic healthcare business a solid base and this means the world to me because I can see the importance of my work.  I know I have a gift to share with the world and I know I can make a difference on this planet. This training will allow me to integrate the aspect of touch more into my practice because I can see the power of touch in the world.  </p>
<p>Ballet and the performing arts are so beauitful and so needed, so it is my mission to free the artists from their tension, stress and dis-ease which so easily plagues them so that they can produce even more beauty with much more ease and resiliency.  </p>
<p>Hellerwork is completely brilliant and totally heart-centered which I believe is greatly needed in the world.  I am blessed by the opportunity to be pursuing it.  The process to get to this point has not been easy, before I applied to training and even while I was applying, working my way through the application process itself, I went through so much soul searching and yet I also felt my calling to this work more and more strongly.  And the training is hard and yet I am growing so much through this training both in what I offer through my own dancing and to my clients.  </p>

<h2>The most mineralized salt in the world</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Here at Saltbrennslan, our goal is to improve your (and others‘) mineral nutrition, and we hope to improve public health by moving the focus to prevention instead of treatment of disease. We strongly believe our organic salt, Viking Silver, to be the simplest and tastiest solution to improve your mineral status.</p>
<p>It is difficult to even scratch the surface of how important trace elements are to the human diet, and how many of them western people usually lack, with the notable exception of sodium (<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">common varieties of salt are almost pure sodium chloride).</span></p>
<p>We measured 72 different mineral elements in the salt and the results are phenomenal.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Thanks to the wonderful ability of algae to concentrate essential minerals, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Viking Silver salt contains 1.7% iodine, while iodized salt contains 0.0025%, or 680 times less. Our salt, contrary to regular salt, has only 8.8% sodium, and a whopping 20.6% of potassium.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>

<h2>For mothers to be</h2>
<p>Some say that iodine is the most important supplement for women of childbearing age. Their future children would certainly make sure they get enough, as deficiency can cause mental and physical retardation, lower birth weight and IQ. Iodine also reduces the risk of breast cancer and increases the fertility of the mother.</p>
<p>Iodized salt and wheat has made great advancements for children and mothers all over the world. Before iodization, thyroid and developmental disorders were even more common than today. However, these programs just provide a bare minimum and only work for 26% of the US population. Japan has one of the lowest breast cancer rates and is the world leader in algae and therefore iodine consumption, and plenty of research suggests much higher intake of iodine to be beneficial.</p>

<h2><b>The problems of modern diet</b></h2>
<p>We all know that the food industry has created some problems. One of the most serious is the limited variety of minerals in our diet. More than two billion people suffer from severe iodine deficiency, 98% of americans lack potassium and 9 out of 10 consume, on average, twice the recommended maximum of sodium.</p>
<p>Sadly, 86% of Europeans die from preventable lifestyle diseases, which are all worsened by mineral deficiencies. Scientists tell us that heart disease, cancer, obesity, chronic fatigue, infertility, depression and many other conditions are impacted by excess sodium or lack of minerals. Unfortunately, little is being done to mend the situation. Keep reading to learn how we can change that, with your help.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">     </span></p>

<h2>A Viking Legacy</h2>

<p>Salt was a precious commodity on the misty islands of the Viking era. There were no salt mines, collecting dried salt from rocks was a painstaking process and importing was expensive. But the Vikings discovered another way of producing salt. By the power of fire, they burned seaweeds to extract their salty mineral content!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1100344/files/20141216071507-burning.jpg?1418742907"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Vikings were healthy people and knew about some of the benefits of ash salt. Viking Silver marks a rebirth of the tradition and now we have finally determined the composition of their wonderful salt and can surely call it the healthiest in the world.</p>
<p>The method was used in Iceland until the middle ages, when it was abandoned due to improved transportation. Like the ancient silver of the vikings, this salt is precious and has a beautiful greyish black color. We will produce your <i>Viking Silver</i> on the only known site of salt burning in Iceland, The Sleeping Islands (Svefneyjar) of Breidafjordur. Depending on your perk, you may have the chance to visit these islands and have a true Viking adventure.<br/></p>

<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>100% organic kelp</h2>
<p>Seaweeds naturally concentrate almost all of the essential minerals, especially iodine. By burning the organic matter in the kelp, the minerals are concentrated even further. The black color derives mostly from coal, which is thought to ease digestion, similar to fibers. The raw material is gathered by an existing algae powder producer in Breidafjordur, Iceland. Their production is certified as sustainable, organic and fit for human consumption.</p>

<p>We have had over 100 people try the Viking Silver Super Salt, and not one has been dissatisfied by the taste. The look and taste are unlike any other salt and it is definitely the best seasoning for fish. It can be used to replace salt in any dish, is great on steaks and stews alike!</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are young entrepeneurs who believe that our salt could help many people. We have studied chemistry, ecology, medicine, coastal and marine management, design and history and we have a broad knowledge of environmental and public health issues. The Sleeping Islands of Breidafjordur will be our future residence and we love the direct contact with nature, the birds and the sea.</p>

<br/><h2>Help us bring Viking Silver to the world</h2>
<p>By spending some of our savings, and a lot of work, we have recreated the forgotten salt of the Vikings. The chemical analyses have been made and we are ready to sail to market. We have all of the needed supply lines and have our action plan ready. We chose to use preorders and crowdfunding to finance the required factory equipment, because we did not want to hand control of our vision to venture capitalists. We ask your help to bring Viking Silver Salt to the world, and will instead provide great rewards (mostly salty ones :-). We would be even more grateful if you helped spread the word about mineral nutrition!</p>

<p><b>How much should I

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When you start using Viking Silver, you should start by
using no more than 1g for a few days, then gradually increase the dosage as you
see fit, but no more than 10g per day (1 tablespoon). The recommend usage as a

<p><b>Is the product safe? </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes. Though algae
contain some arsenosugars, they are not nearly as toxic as inorganic
arsenic. The measured quantity of arsenic in the salt is also well within safe
limits. Even more comforting is the fact that kelp concentrates antidotes to

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When organic
matter is burnt, some side products of the combustion can be harmful. The

</div></div>","Whether you want to improve your health, support mineral research, enjoy savory flavor, or have a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" Viking experience on a pristine archipelago, this is the project for you!




The most mineralized salt in the world
Here at Saltbrennslan, our goal is to improve your (and others‘) mineral nutrition, and we hope to improve public health by moving the focus to prevention instead of treatment of disease. We strongly believe our organic salt, Viking Silver, to be the simplest and tastiest solution to improve your mineral status.
It is difficult to even scratch the surface of how important trace elements are to the human diet, and how many of them western people usually lack, with the notable exception of sodium (common varieties of salt are almost pure sodium chloride).
We measured 72 different mineral elements in the salt and the results are phenomenal.  Thanks to the wonderful ability of algae to concentrate essential minerals, Viking Silver salt contains 1.7% iodine, while iodized salt contains 0.0025%, or 680 times less. Our salt, contrary to regular salt, has only 8.8% sodium, and a whopping 20.6% of potassium.  



For mothers to be
Some say that iodine is the most important supplement for women of childbearing age. Their future children would certainly make sure they get enough, as deficiency can cause mental and physical retardation, lower birth weight and IQ. Iodine also reduces the risk of breast cancer and increases the fertility of the mother.
Iodized salt and wheat has made great advancements for children and mothers all over the world. Before iodization, thyroid and developmental disorders were even more common than today. However, these programs just provide a bare minimum and only work for 26% of the US population. Japan has one of the lowest breast cancer rates and is the world leader in algae and therefore iodine consumption, and plenty of research suggests much higher intake of iodine to be beneficial.
                                               



The problems of modern diet
We all know that the food industry has created some problems. One of the most serious is the limited variety of minerals in our diet. More than two billion people suffer from severe iodine deficiency, 98% of americans lack potassium and 9 out of 10 consume, on average, twice the recommended maximum of sodium.
Sadly, 86% of Europeans die from preventable lifestyle diseases, which are all worsened by mineral deficiencies. Scientists tell us that heart disease, cancer, obesity, chronic fatigue, infertility, depression and many other conditions are impacted by excess sodium or lack of minerals. Unfortunately, little is being done to mend the situation. Keep reading to learn how we can change that, with your help.     

         

Supporting mineral research

www.vikingsilversalt.com is our publishing platform for mineral research articles. There you will also find useful life-hacks to save you money, time, or even your life. Learn to prevent radiation sickness after a nuclear accident and why iodine can prevent the early stages of breast cancer. We plan to add many more articles during the campaign, and after.

2% of the total income of this campaign and all future sales, will go towards a research fund supporting mineral research, one third of which will go to students. Anyone can apply for a grant, and we want to have a public voting system to select the recipients of these grants.

A Viking Legacy
                     
Salt was a precious commodity on the misty islands of the Viking era. There were no salt mines, collecting dried salt from rocks was a painstaking process and importing was expensive. But the Vikings discovered another way of producing salt. By the power of fire, they burned seaweeds to extract their salty mineral content!

The Vikings were healthy people and knew about some of the benefits of ash salt. Viking Silver marks a rebirth of the tradition and now we have finally determined the composition of their wonderful salt and can surely call it the healthiest in the world.
The method was used in Iceland until the middle ages, when it was abandoned due to improved transportation. Like the ancient silver of the vikings, this salt is precious and has a beautiful greyish black color. We will produce your Viking Silver on the only known site of salt burning in Iceland, The Sleeping Islands (Svefneyjar) of Breidafjordur. Depending on your perk, you may have the chance to visit these islands and have a true Viking adventure.



100% organic kelp
Seaweeds naturally concentrate almost all of the essential minerals, especially iodine. By burning the organic matter in the kelp, the minerals are concentrated even further. The black color derives mostly from coal, which is thought to ease digestion, similar to fibers. The raw material is gathered by an existing algae powder producer in Breidafjordur, Iceland. Their production is certified as sustainable, organic and fit for human consumption.
         

Soon after starting production, we would like to harvest the kelp ourselves, increasing quality and lowering cost. Operations will take place on the magnificent islands of Svefneyjar, and in the capital of Breidafjordur; Stykkishólmur.

Approved by the consumers
We have had over 100 people try the Viking Silver Super Salt, and not one has been dissatisfied by the taste. The look and taste are unlike any other salt and it is definitely the best seasoning for fish. It can be used to replace salt in any dish, is great on steaks and stews alike!


Who are we?
We are young entrepeneurs who believe that our salt could help many people. We have studied chemistry, ecology, medicine, coastal and marine management, design and history and we have a broad knowledge of environmental and public health issues. The Sleeping Islands of Breidafjordur will be our future residence and we love the direct contact with nature, the birds and the sea.

Help us bring Viking Silver to the world
By spending some of our savings, and a lot of work, we have recreated the forgotten salt of the Vikings. The chemical analyses have been made and we are ready to sail to market. We have all of the needed supply lines and have our action plan ready. We chose to use preorders and crowdfunding to finance the required factory equipment, because we did not want to hand control of our vision to venture capitalists. We ask your help to bring Viking Silver Salt to the world, and will instead provide great rewards (mostly salty ones :-). We would be even more grateful if you helped spread the word about mineral nutrition!


...and experience Viking Adventure
We offer you unique and interesting rewards for supporting this campaign. A taste of the super salt as soon as it is ready, volume discounts and other rewards. And, if you dare, you can explore the Viking Legends yourself! 

We think the most inspiring experience of all may be to visit the beautiful archipelago of Svefneyjar, especially in the summer. The bird life is incredible with tens of thousands of nesting seabirds and around seven thousand eiders. There are sheep and other farm animals, plenty of fish in the ocean, and endless beaches full of algae and sea critters. Breathtaking mountain view, sustainable living and the golden silence... We are honored to welcome high level supporters to join us for a unique Viking experience on this paradise.


$15 and above allows you to experience the unique flavor and benefits of our super salt yourself. We offer increasing value at each perk level, you can get the salt in reusable, BPA-free jars and even a life-time supply for $8000!


                              
$50 and above get the Viking Silver t-shirt. You can choose your size from S to XXL, women or men and in black, white, red or blue. There will be two or three design options that you can choose from (we will e-mail you for the choice).

                             

The $100+ perk is this handmade, Icelandic, real silver necklace on a leather string, with the engraving of your choice in viking runes (we will e-mail you for the choice).
                                                            
The perks from $500 dare you to visit our facilities in Iceland. Meet the team and learn everything about the product, its fabrication and its history. 
$3000 and above gets you this hand-smithed, low maintenance, stainless steel viking cutlery in stainless steel in a leather poach with belt loops.
                                                             
For $8000, receive this high quality hand-made drinking horn. Engraved with the Hammer of Thor and made of actual cow horn, so yours may look slightly different. It has leather straps and can hold 24 oz or 709 mL of liquid.
                                                                      



    
Risks and challenges
Too few preorders. This is a possibility, but we have a
backup plan! We can scale down the production to home-industry level at an
approved facility, and make the salt by hand.
Too many preorders! If we start to feel overwhelmed by the
number of pre-orders, we may have to take the difficult steps necessary to
upscale the production at a faster pace (getting outside investment).
Fulfillment timing. Since the setting up of equipment, licensing,
material deliveries and production are not entirely predictable, we have a
buffer zone for the timing of perk deliveries, although delays may be inevitable.

<p>   Imagine if in our childhood there was this kind of professional simulator for kids like Evnik, and our parents would introduce sport to us, and we could have such skills as Evnika demonstrates us. What would our life be, how brighter we would be able to shine in it and easier to overcome natural difficulties of life? Time passed, like you I didn’t get such skills in my childhood, but today I give this opportunity to my kids and willingly share my experience with you. </p>           The idea of sharing this information with you was suggested by my friends. Every time my friends visit me, they see the energy my children throw out, their movements, emotions and ardor, so they always say the same: “Wish my parents have taught me so!…” But really, the human nature itself suggests us caring about our children since childhood, giving them everything we can. <div>

<div>CLASSIC Evnik simulator model is “classical” special “lean” model, which thank to its ergonomics is able to teach you to use your potential energy, which is in different levels of organization of biomechanics of your body. This particular simulator model can be widely used in all spheres of SHAPING, AEROBICS, PILATES, STRETCHING, and also in play, field-and-track kinds of sport and sporting fighting. We recommend to everybody the very this simulator model because it will teach the best to use your potential energy, increase your speed and power characteristics. This model almost doesn’t have restrictions in using and it is useful with achieving of any your goals (see below “goals”). The warranty of the simulator is 3 years (will work more than 10 years).<br/>

<div>The Evnik simulator, SSS model is a special model for professional sportsmen with outstanding skills, which are able to create more powerful primary impulse. Only having the skill to create the powerful primary impulse (giving jerking movement to the simulator), you are able to make the simulator work.  This simulator by contrast with the classical model doesn't teach you to extract the potential energy, it is  more focused on the perfection of the process of releasing the potential energy. The simulator is made from several special elastic alloys and has big system hardness with high elastic coefficient. The simulator is directed to the development of skill of neuromuscular apparatus, reducing time of transiting of a muscle from relax condition to intense and lets make more powerful maneuvers. The warranty of the simulator is 3 years (will work more than 10 years).</div>

<p>Evnik simulator not only awakes the energies <b>in its body and in the organism</b>, but it, <b>by consolidation of muscular efforts</b>, can transform receiving energy into <b>force-speedy results</b> of individual.

   Evnik Simulator


                     Evnik replaces many - Nothing replaces Evnik         
   Professional sportsmen



We are proud that professional sportsmen need Evnik!




It is difficult to imagine, how these boys and girls had been training without Evnik…



          THE VARIETY OF MANEUVERS WITH EVNIK IS AMAZING!

                  


                                SAAD’VAKASS IS REVOLUTION IN SPORT





  New Fitness! 

From now on, the most difficult hand movements, requiring quickness, power and accuracy of the trajectory, can be practiced with the help of Evnik!
   
My name is Anzha, i participate in the world Kung FU championship, full contact in a adult league when i was 15 years old. I took a bronze medal. Every day i train with evnik simulator.

My name is Evnika and people usually tells me that i am the fastest boxing girl ever. I am training with evnik simulator for 4 years, this is my favourite training tool.         



SAAD’VAKASS IS REVOLUTION IN SPORT



My name is Rush, i am 13 years old, nobody believes that i do not workout with bars and dumbbells, but i am training only with Evnik. Evnik can make your muscles work, and make your muscles more fast and strong. I am boxer and i am always win.





 I’m a mother of seven and have a big experience in visiting hospitals. While talking to doctors you find out, that one of the biggest young mother’s problems is overweight, that according to doctors is harmful for fetus. Doctors say that due to my sportive way of life I can hide my numerous pregnancies.                                                                                                                  

If they only knew, that all my sport is 5-10 minutes every day trainings with Evnik.



With Evnik you can do everything you want: you can slim, you can become more strong and fast, you can heal muscles, back and neck pain.

                                                           
WE WILL REFUND YOU MONEY if you don't like the simulator.
                                           


CHOOSE YOUR OWN EVNIK MODEL. 
Detalize your dreams and follow it, with Evnik it is easy



  
    Who are we? Our ideas!


 We are friendly and happy family! An interesting story has happened with us. For many years we used our own invention for training of our children, so we didn't think, that we had a unique simulator. We also didn't understand, that we are the creators of technology without analogues in the world. Many sportsmen, children and elderly people need in this technology. Today we want to share our thoughts and ideas with you, and also offer you cross together this stormy ocean, full of adventures, difficulties and hopes...






I see a new period in human development, when every person since the moment of birth can achieve  exceptional abilities, which will let people to be superheroes with their prefect physical data.  It's every child's right to be taught to be strong, dexterous and fast before his 5 years old to teach him to use getting skills during his whole rest of life.





      

 
                                       
   Imagine if in our childhood there was this kind of professional simulator for kids like Evnik, and our parents would introduce sport to us, and we could have such skills as Evnika demonstrates us. What would our life be, how brighter we would be able to shine in it and easier to overcome natural difficulties of life? Time passed, like you I didn’t get such skills in my childhood, but today I give this opportunity to my kids and willingly share my experience with you.            The idea of sharing this information with you was suggested by my friends. Every time my friends visit me, they see the energy my children throw out, their movements, emotions and ardor, so they always say the same: “Wish my parents have taught me so!…” But really, the human nature itself suggests us caring about our children since childhood, giving them everything we can. 


Take 10 minutes of your precious time to study the Evnik simulator’s miracle effect   and you will be surprised at its usefulness and convenience!






CLASSIC Evnik simulator model is “classical” special “lean” model, which thank to its ergonomics is able to teach you to use your potential energy, which is in different levels of organization of biomechanics of your body. This particular simulator model can be widely used in all spheres of SHAPING, AEROBICS, PILATES, STRETCHING, and also in play, field-and-track kinds of sport and sporting fighting. We recommend to everybody the very this simulator model because it will teach the best to use your potential energy, increase your speed and power characteristics. This model almost doesn’t have restrictions in using and it is useful with achieving of any your goals (see below “goals”). The warranty of the simulator is 3 years (will work more than 10 years).





The Evnik simulator, SSS model is a special model for professional sportsmen with outstanding skills, which are able to create more powerful primary impulse. Only having the skill to create the powerful primary impulse (giving jerking movement to the simulator), you are able to make the simulator work.  This simulator by contrast with the classical model doesn't teach you to extract the potential energy, it is  more focused on the perfection of the process of releasing the potential energy. The simulator is made from several special elastic alloys and has big system hardness with high elastic coefficient. The simulator is directed to the development of skill of neuromuscular apparatus, reducing time of transiting of a muscle from relax condition to intense and lets make more powerful maneuvers. The warranty of the simulator is 3 years (will work more than 10 years).



  Methodology







                   

        




Help us to finish patenting of the Evnik simulator.According to World Intellectual Property Organisation's (WIPO) report, our project doesn't have even close substitutes in the whole world! during the limited time we should make an application in the all rest of countries for implementation of project's patenting. Nowadays, we have patented our Evnik simulator in 9 countries in the world. we are consumed with desire to have a product, patented in the whole world. we want you to never regret that you have spent your time in our company.





    Science from Saadvakass



Saadvakass’s effect is new phenomenon in sport practice, which is expressed in more powerful and fast-moving maneuvers (striking, swinging, jerking and other impulsive and combined explorations).

 

                 
Saadvakass’s effect unites and consolidates the efforts of other effects (see below), which awake in different levels of organism organization, with innovative devise “Accumulator of mechanical energy Evnik”, hereafter Evnik simulator.



Evnik simulator not only awakes the energies in its body and in the organism, but it, by consolidation of muscular efforts, can transform receiving energy into force-speedy results of individual. That’s why the maneuvers of trainee become more powerful and fast-moving, so Saadvakass’s effect becomes definitely perceptible.

Thank to predictable reactions of neuromuscular system in response to stimulation, made by Evnik simulator, and Evnik ability to generate the energy at the moment of eccentric muscular contraction (hereafter MC), accumulate the energy at the moment of  isometric MC and enforce the release of energy at the moment of concentric MC (transforming the whole generated energies into force-speedy results).  That’s why the Saadvakass’s effect is an important acquisition for healthful prophylactic and sport practice. 
Extremely fast, powerful, exact and accent maneuvers, made in such level as Saadvakass demonstrate us, are available only with using of “Accumulator of mechanical energy Evnik”. Our assiduous searches together with  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), show us that there isn’t technology or simulator in the world, which can inculcate you such progressive sport skills.

<h3>The Most Overlooked Health Issue</h3> <p>Today you can't turn on  the TV without seeing an infomercial for a new health care or fitness product.</p>
<p>But with everything that is out there to tone and strengthen all of the different muscle groups of the body... ONE muscle has never been addressed and it is one of the most important muscles in our entire body.</p>
<p>It is called the Pubo-coccygeus muscle or... PC Muscle. </p>
<p>It is a <strong>deep tissue muscle</strong> and it is located in the pelvic floor. It is responsible for supporting all of our internal organs so that they can function properly and efficiently as well as being responsible for sexual sensitivity and sexual function.</p>
<p>This little muscle also controls the flow of urine and feces. But because it is a deep tissue muscle, it is the most difficult muscle in the body to tone and strengthen.</p>
<p>AND... the old saying ""Out-of-sight... Out-of-mind."" applies here.</p>
<p>It is something that we simply do not think about.</p>
<p>We seldom recognize what an important role this little muscle plays not only in our intimate life but our everyday function and our over-all well-being.</p>
<p>As this little muscle deteriorates it becomes more difficult to feel making it more difficult to isolate and work. By the time this happens, not even Kegel exercises will help.</p>
<p>The KIE is designed to alleviate the symptoms of Urinary Stress Incontinence and help to redevelop the Pelvic Floor after Childbirth. The KIE also increases circulation to the Groin Area in Men to help relieve certain type of Prostate Conditions and in many cases PREVENT them altogether and the list goes on. </p>

But with everything that is out there to tone and strengthen all of the different muscle groups of the body... ONE muscle has never been addressed and it is one of the most important muscles in our entire body.
It is called the Pubo-coccygeus muscle or... PC Muscle. 
It is a deep tissue muscle and it is located in the pelvic floor. It is responsible for supporting all of our internal organs so that they can function properly and efficiently as well as being responsible for sexual sensitivity and sexual function.
This little muscle also controls the flow of urine and feces. But because it is a deep tissue muscle, it is the most difficult muscle in the body to tone and strengthen.
AND... the old saying ""Out-of-sight... Out-of-mind."" applies here.
It is something that we simply do not think about.
We seldom recognize what an important role this little muscle plays not only in our intimate life but our everyday function and our over-all well-being.
As this little muscle deteriorates it becomes more difficult to feel making it more difficult to isolate and work. By the time this happens, not even Kegel exercises will help.
The KIE is designed to alleviate the symptoms of Urinary Stress Incontinence and help to redevelop the Pelvic Floor after Childbirth. The KIE also increases circulation to the Groin Area in Men to help relieve certain type of Prostate Conditions and in many cases PREVENT them altogether and the list goes on. 





   
* 56% of Men will have a Prostate Disorder by the time they are 50 * 32% of Men will become Incontinent by the time they are 50* 36% of Men will have ED by the time they are 40  All of these disorders BEGIN with a lack of circulation to the groin area.
Because the KIE is an EXTERNAL EXERCISE DEVICE it is the ONLY tool available on the market that men can use to increase circulation to the groin area to help prevent or alleviate certain types of prostate conditions,   incontinence and ED.
New Moms need strong healthy muscles in the Pelvic floorThe KIE can help with that. * Helps to Alleviate Prenatal Discomfort. * Helps to Facilitate an easier delivery. * Shortens Post-natal Recovery time. * Restores strength and elasticity to the pelvic floor after child birth.Also know as USI.... or Urinary Stress IncontinenceFor years the Diapers for Adults Industry has been telling us that this is something that we have to expect and it is just part of getting older. This is not true.93% of ALL INCONTINENCE is STRESS Incontinence.... this means that this little muscle has gotten weak and just like with any other muscle, it can be redeveloped.* 52,000,000 people are Incontinent.* The Diapers for Adults Industry is LARGER than the Diapers for babies industry.Men's #1 Complaint about their Intimate Partner is that their 'Grip' is never tight enough.A strong, healthy PC Muscle not only increases Sexual Sensitivity, it increases the strength of a woman's grip on the penis for maximum pleasure for your intimate partner... and no more worries about embarrassing vaginal air.A Woman's #1 complaint about their intimate partner is two-fold: Premature Ejaculation and the Inability to Sustain an Erection. The KIE helps to tone and strengthen the PC muscle to help men control ejaculation and to help sustain a erection.
Now you can get the Fantasy Bootie of your Dreams WITHOUT Squats or Lunges. The KIE helps to tone and tighten, shape and define the Gluts in just a few minutes a day.The KIE is based on the same Principal body builders use:Isolate the Muscle... Apply Resistance... Achieve Development...

                                                         Enough said... 
            If you don't have any of these problems.... you don't want them...
                                                     You NEED the KIE


























Since the mid 1950's doctors have been recommending that women do the Kegel exercise after childbirth to help restore the muscles of the pelvic floor, but in recent years we have discovered that these exercises are a valuable health benefit to men as well.
The Kegel exercise is where you contract and release the principal muscle of the pelvic floor... the Pubo-coccygeus or PC Muscle.
To locate and flex this muscle, when you begin urinating... first, you let a small amount of urine out, then squeeze this muscle to stop the flow of urine. Then you continue to repeat this over and over until the bladder is empty.
THAT is the PC Muscle... and THOSE are the Kegel exercises.
This sounds simple, but it is not.
The problem with the Kegel exercise is, that once this little muscle is damaged or begins to deteriorate or atrophy, it becomes more and more difficult to isolate and flex this muscle. THEN, this muscle becomes more difficult to even FEEL. 
This is where the KIE comes in.
Precision positioning along with exact execution of the KIE Method AUTOMATICALLY isolates and forces this deep tissue muscle into action.
The KIE not only provides solid results, it also provides something that regular Kegel exercises do not.
The KIE provides an Adjustable Resistance Device so that you can continue to increase your personal level of development.
And... the KIE is safe, fun and easy to use.






The KIE is the first product that meets an incredible need, one that has been neglected for decades.
It has tremendous health benefits and both medical and therapeutic applications.
The KIE is a really smart fitness product that can also be used in the prevention of many related problems.
It is Patented, Proven and Tested and truly helps people.
It improves intimate relationships as well as doing away with feelings of sexual inadequacy.
And where once there was only the quick fix of an adult diaper that is momentary at best there is now peace of mind and personal confidence... and no more ""Giggle and Piddle"" Syndrome.
It is a safe, natural and effective fitness product that allows both men and women to enjoy the incredible health benefits that result from stronger pelvic floor muscles.

<p>The Shampoo Station is the solution!  It has been specifically designed for bed-ridden individuals in skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, assisted living, and private residences with home healthcare needs.  This product is different because it is fully contained and does not require an attached plumbing source.  It is also ergonomically designed to support the back; allowing for the individual to be comfortably positioned without strain to their neck.  And, it weighs less than 8 lbs so it is easy for the caretaker to lift or transport.  </p>
<p><em><strong>""The need for home/assisted living healthcare/hygiene aid to assist in day to day living will increase by 75% in the next 10-15 years</strong></em>,"" according to the Bureau of vital statistics.</p>
<p>Help us bring a very useful hygiene aid to market so that everyone can age gracefully with dignity.  I personally wish I had this product as I cared for my own aging parents.  </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary As a licensed hair stylist with more than 25 years experience, I've come to realize a ""need"" that was not being met while working with seniors or anyone confined to a bed.  There was no easy or comfortable way for them to have their hair shampooed!  With the aging population, it is my desire to see that our seniors or anyone confined to a bed receive better hair care.  I'm sure you will agree (especially if you are female), if your hair isn't clean, you don't feel good either!  Plus, having clean hair is important to hygiene and good health!
The Shampoo Station is the solution!  It has been specifically designed for bed-ridden individuals in skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, assisted living, and private residences with home healthcare needs.  This product is different because it is fully contained and does not require an attached plumbing source.  It is also ergonomically designed to support the back; allowing for the individual to be comfortably positioned without strain to their neck.  And, it weighs less than 8 lbs so it is easy for the caretaker to lift or transport.  
""The need for home/assisted living healthcare/hygiene aid to assist in day to day living will increase by 75% in the next 10-15 years,"" according to the Bureau of vital statistics.
Help us bring a very useful hygiene aid to market so that everyone can age gracefully with dignity.  I personally wish I had this product as I cared for my own aging parents.  
 What We Need & What You Get
 We have spent that past year finalizing our product design, product testing, getting the product patent and setting up our company structure and marketing strategy.  We are ready to manufacture our tool and then begin production...we're almost there but need some additional funds to finalize the manufacturing of the tool to get the product out  the door .  100% of this funding is going to the tool manufacturing and first production run.  Please note that on the attached video, the water source was used for demonstration only and is being custom designed.
In the event, we don't receive all of the funds with this campaign, all monies will be put towards the manufacturing of this tool and we will continue the quest to finish raising more capital through other sources.   
Of course, we want to thank you for your donation.  Here's what's in it for you.  If you donate:

The Impact We have all known someone who was unable to shower or bathe themselves and were confined to bed due to illness, surgery, or injury.  They were not able to cleanse themselves properly and were given the option of dry shampoos which do not properly cleanse the hair.  Ask anyone in this situation and they will tell you they want nothing more than a their hair to be properly shampooed!  Imagine being part of the solution!

<p>Aloha and thank you for checking out our campaign! First off,
let us tell you a little bit about who we are and how Sweet Aloha got started.
Co-founders Simi Rodgers (Irmo, South Carolina) and Devon Harris (South
Berwick, Maine) met on Oahu while wwoofing on an organic kale farm this past
fall (what is wwoofing, you may ask? Check out <a href=""http://www.wwoof.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wwoof.net</a>
for more info!). Both young women taking time off from school and interested in
organic farming and healthy, holistic lifestyles, we became friends
immediately. And after trying some of our friends's delicious sugarcane juice, we discovered another common interest: we were both completely
hooked on the delicious drink that tasted like liquid sunshine and was a healthier
alternative to the refined sugar drinks that we saw offered everywhere else.
After getting to juice our own cane, experiment with our own flavors, and learn
from our master sugarcane-juicing friends, we decided to turn our love for this delicious drink into a business. But we would not
take the easy route. From the very beginning the Sweet Aloha girls pledged that
our sugarcane juice would be made from <b>organic, all natural, and local
ingredients—</b>setting us apart from our competitors and ensuring that our
personal values would not get lost in the hype of selling our product. </p><p>Sweet
Aloha is about more than just juice, it is a business committed to the progress
of organic, healthy eating and the spread of the “aloha spirit”—putting love
and respect first and foremost when it comes to our juices, our customers, our
bodies, and our 'aina (land). </p><p><br/></p>

<br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Sweet Aloha sugarcane juices will start with fresh-pressed
juice from only organic and sustainably grown sugarcane from Maui. Without
giving too much away, our variety of flavors will come from organic fruits and
ingredients, such as hibiscus bud, lavender, strawberry guava, lilikoi, and
more. Our juices can either be purchased in biodegradable cups or reusable glass jars.</span><br/></p>

dawning of a new and sweeter day”
Who are we?

“ALOHA: Aloha
is a value, one of unconditional love. 
Aloha is the
outpouring and receiving of the spirit”
Aloha and thank you for checking out our campaign! First off,
let us tell you a little bit about who we are and how Sweet Aloha got started.
Co-founders Simi Rodgers (Irmo, South Carolina) and Devon Harris (South
Berwick, Maine) met on Oahu while wwoofing on an organic kale farm this past
fall (what is wwoofing, you may ask? Check out www.wwoof.net
for more info!). Both young women taking time off from school and interested in
organic farming and healthy, holistic lifestyles, we became friends
immediately. And after trying some of our friends's delicious sugarcane juice, we discovered another common interest: we were both completely
hooked on the delicious drink that tasted like liquid sunshine and was a healthier
alternative to the refined sugar drinks that we saw offered everywhere else.
After getting to juice our own cane, experiment with our own flavors, and learn
from our master sugarcane-juicing friends, we decided to turn our love for this delicious drink into a business. But we would not
take the easy route. From the very beginning the Sweet Aloha girls pledged that
our sugarcane juice would be made from organic, all natural, and local
ingredients—setting us apart from our competitors and ensuring that our
personal values would not get lost in the hype of selling our product. Sweet
Aloha is about more than just juice, it is a business committed to the progress
of organic, healthy eating and the spread of the “aloha spirit”—putting love
and respect first and foremost when it comes to our juices, our customers, our
bodies, and our 'aina (land). 
What are we selling? 


Sweet Aloha sugarcane juices will start with fresh-pressed
juice from only organic and sustainably grown sugarcane from Maui. Without
giving too much away, our variety of flavors will come from organic fruits and
ingredients, such as hibiscus bud, lavender, strawberry guava, lilikoi, and
more. Our juices can either be purchased in biodegradable cups or reusable glass jars.
Our unique flavors will highlight the tropical tastes of the islands, while providing your body with essential vitamins and nutrients in every sip. 



STOP Cane Burning

We want it to be
known to all of our customers that Sweet Aloha will be sourcing our sugarcane from farms that do not participate in
the harvesting technique used by companies like Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company
known as cane burning. 
Cane burning is an
old farming technique that uses controlled fires to prepare the cane stalks for
harvest. These fires are extremely detrimental to the air quality of Maui and
are directly affecting the health of the people of Hawaii. Black ash, what is
referred to as “Maui Snow” is produced, certainly not
helping the over 106,000 people in Hawaii who suffer from asthma.* 
Fortunately there are many wonderful farms that have found organic and eco-conscious ways to harvest this wonderful healing sugarcane, and we look forward to working with them. We plan to collaborate with
the fantastic campaign Clean Air for Keiki, in order to spread the word about
cane burning, and work towards a Maui without this problem.

Do your fingers ache at the mere thought of manually inputting that pile of printed content lying on your desk into the computer, just so you can start getting some actual work done?<br/><br/></span>
<p><span>How tedious is it to use online word-for-word translation services, especially for non-digitized text? What if it’s in Russian or Japanese? Will you use an on-screen keyboard or character map for every letter? </span></p>
<p><span>Let’s get even more profound and down-to-earth: what if your grandpa can’t read his newspapers this morning because he forgot to take his glasses with him to the park, or has eyesight issues?</span></p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1311600/files/20150320155051-IMG_1841newaf61-vert.jpg?1426891851"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span>Chances are you’re a regular Joe like us. Chances are you and the people you care about have been in situations like these many times over. <b>Whether you’re a student or an office worker, a journalist in the field or a businessman dealing with an international client</b> - think of all those times when you submitted to this tedium with a sigh... Yes, we didn’t have to look much further than ourselves and our own families to find examples, too. <br/></span><p></p><p></p>
<h3 align=""center""><span style=""color: #EB1478;"">Our Reasoning</span></h3>
<p>How fast do you type? <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=typing+speed+test&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here’s a few websites</a> that offer free tests. I do around 40 words per minute (WPM) myself. Not terribly fast, but not too slow, either. <b>At an approximate 500 words per standard A4 page, I spend a theoretical minimum of 12 minutes typing any one page.</b> And since I’m no professional typist, I then have to check and edit it for errors. Only after all this is done can I actually start working on whatever it is that I needed the text digitized for in the first place.</p>
<br/>
<p>Our Optical Character Recognition (OCR) hardware, which forms the core of TheRightPen, can process <b>up to 1000 WPM</b>, without making any mistakes (chance of false scan is 1 in 10.000.000 words). You’d actually have to lay down more than two standard A4 pages filled with text side-by-side and be continuously using the device REALLY fast in order to even theoretically approach its processing limits. This, we feel, could happen only if you’re a super secret agent-man on a perfectly-timed spying mission, in which case come talk to us afterwards and we’ll discuss product improvements in private. ;)</p>

<i>""Being an early tester of TRP really gave me the edge in my study efficiency. This is FAST!"" - Paolo Maria Filacchione</i>, PhD candidate from Rome<br/>

<p>You’ll agree that we are discussing quite a leap in productivity, regardless of how you look at it. Add to that the ability to <b>choose from over 200 languages</b> for input, output and <b>instant audio translation, enough storage to hold 1,400 books</b> worth of content, <b>a battery that lasts for weeks on end</b> - and you have a ridiculously powerful gizmo in your pocket. It is often said that knowledge wants to be free. We like to think that this is our small way of contributing to a global knowledge revolution, helping information get free from the shackles of paper and foreign languages, becoming more immediately useful to everyone, everywhere, at any time.</p>

Do your fingers ache at the mere thought of manually inputting that pile of printed content lying on your desk into the computer, just so you can start getting some actual work done?
How tedious is it to use online word-for-word translation services, especially for non-digitized text? What if it’s in Russian or Japanese? Will you use an on-screen keyboard or character map for every letter? 
Let’s get even more profound and down-to-earth: what if your grandpa can’t read his newspapers this morning because he forgot to take his glasses with him to the park, or has eyesight issues?
Chances are you’re a regular Joe like us. Chances are you and the people you care about have been in situations like these many times over. Whether you’re a student or an office worker, a journalist in the field or a businessman dealing with an international client - think of all those times when you submitted to this tedium with a sigh... Yes, we didn’t have to look much further than ourselves and our own families to find examples, too. 
Our Reasoning
How fast do you type? Here’s a few websites that offer free tests. I do around 40 words per minute (WPM) myself. Not terribly fast, but not too slow, either. At an approximate 500 words per standard A4 page, I spend a theoretical minimum of 12 minutes typing any one page. And since I’m no professional typist, I then have to check and edit it for errors. Only after all this is done can I actually start working on whatever it is that I needed the text digitized for in the first place.

Our Optical Character Recognition (OCR) hardware, which forms the core of TheRightPen, can process up to 1000 WPM, without making any mistakes (chance of false scan is 1 in 10.000.000 words). You’d actually have to lay down more than two standard A4 pages filled with text side-by-side and be continuously using the device REALLY fast in order to even theoretically approach its processing limits. This, we feel, could happen only if you’re a super secret agent-man on a perfectly-timed spying mission, in which case come talk to us afterwards and we’ll discuss product improvements in private. ;)


""Being an early tester of TRP really gave me the edge in my study efficiency. This is FAST!"" - Paolo Maria Filacchione, PhD candidate from Rome

You’ll agree that we are discussing quite a leap in productivity, regardless of how you look at it. Add to that the ability to choose from over 200 languages for input, output and instant audio translation, enough storage to hold 1,400 books worth of content, a battery that lasts for weeks on end - and you have a ridiculously powerful gizmo in your pocket. It is often said that knowledge wants to be free. We like to think that this is our small way of contributing to a global knowledge revolution, helping information get free from the shackles of paper and foreign languages, becoming more immediately useful to everyone, everywhere, at any time.

But wait - there’s more, as they say! Really, though  - we have tested TheRightPen asa visual aid for people with impaired sight and reading-related conditions. We were overjoyed and very proud with the results and their reactions. Check our testimonials and video section for ideas on how TheRightPen can be used in both familiar and new situations, to help with everyday tasks and make life easier for you, your colleagues, friends, elderly and the visually impaired.


""TheRightPen gave me the ability to read the newspapers again. Having it read to me without effort was really wonderful!""  - Ida Fedeli , 74, retiree from Rome

Features



Technical specifications



Software for Win/Mac/AndroidTheRightPen connects to any of your 
other devices that run on Windows, OS X or Android. It will register 
itself as a keyboard device, so the text input is completely handled by 
the factory drivers - no need to install anything! TRP will input the 
scanned text to any program that will take textual input (MS Office, 
notepad...) as if it was coming from a (REALLY fast) keyboard. We will supply you with our own software for fast reading training, which you can see in action in the video above.









""Even if OCR is now an established technology, TheRightPen sets new standards"" - HDblog
Where YOU come in
TheRightPen has already been extensively tested and has reached production stage. We have sourced all previous funding for R&D, prototyping and testing from our own money - what you see in our videos is a finished, working device in real-world situations. We are offering you a feature-complete package. This campaign is a way for us to gauge the interest of the global market for TheRightPen and try to achieve higher economies of scale in our manufacturing process, which would enable us to improve TheRightPen even further. You, will receive your product no matter what! Regardless of the final sum that we manage to raise, you will have your very own TheRightPen in your hands and on time.
Perks and Packages
TheRightPen makes for an excellent productivity tool. This time-saving, headache-avoiding little wonder can easily get you away from a tedious chore into enjoying your newly found free time, as well as help you out in many stressful situations. TheRightPen does what we think all technology should do - it empowers you to actually take command of your life and do the things that matter to you most.Ordering one for yourself will make you deal with text and translation-related work up to 400% faster, compared to manual labour. Ordering two or more -  for that special someone, for your family and friends or your office team, will make you a hero in both their eyes and ours!
We have devised several perk levels for you to choose from, depending on how benevolent and generous you feel.








Referral program
Keep in mind that we track referrals - what this means for you is that when five of your friends follow through and order TheRightPen from a link you sent them, you are liable for a FREE additional device, sent to you completely without charge together with the ones you ordered. Ten referrals will net you two, and so on and so forth.

<h3><i>Invention</i></h3>
<p>BackBaller my Invention, was born from a background in competitive athletics and an enduring period of back pain after rupturing the disc between L5 &amp; S1 vertebrae. Following a grueling search for a sustainable &amp; safe relief I found that the answer lay within us via self-myofascial release.

BackBaller my Invention, was born from a background in competitive athletics and an enduring period of back pain after rupturing the disc between L5 & S1 vertebrae.

My left knee has felt like a knife was imbedded in it. By starting a regular routine of taking the Pure Polar product, my knee pain has been reduced to the point where I can start to take long walks and not limp or experience long-standing periods of sharp pain. I believe that this product will enable me to battle the weight issue I have more effectively and continue to make all my joint problems a thing of the past. Thanks to Pure Polar and to Lou for the recommendation.</p><p><strong><i>SINGER</i></strong> (Madison Watkins on Mar 16, 2017)</p><p>I am a singer who is on the road a lot. These pills have controlled my adrenals, allowed me to have more energy, and have made my body overall healthier. I am so grateful for these!</p><p><strong><i>NO MORE KNEE PAIN</i></strong> (Mark Ross on Mar 15, 2017)</p><p>I just started running again after a long hiatus. I was afraid to start due to knee pain. I started running and started taking Polar on a recommendation from a friend. After a VERY short time - no more knee pain. Nothing - NADA. I feel 20 years younger.</p><p><strong><i>NO MORE JOINT PAIN</i></strong> (Jim Hall on Mar 02, 2017)</p><p>I have suffered for years with a sore right shoulder joint. It is no longer painful and the only change is I have taken Pure Polar 2 pills per day for 3 months.</p><p><strong><i>A BRILLIANT SUPPLEMENT FOR A HEALTHIER LIFE</i></strong> (M A, MD on Feb 18, 2017)</p><p>The amount of stress we place on our bodies during the course of lives is immense.<br/>We can all make due with a product that can help us revitalize. It has been clinically demonstrated that omega fatty acids can help improve our cholesterol levels, and thereby save us from experiencing debilitating diseases such as myocardial infarctions [commonly known as heart attacks] and cerebrovascular accidents [commonly known as strokes]. It can help improve mood by providing us with the adequate nutrtion that keep our nervous system intact. It can also help boost our immune systems.<br/>As a physician I would recommend Pure Polar to anyone looking to improve their health.</p><p><strong><i>HIGHER ENERGY LEVEL</i></strong> (Jeff Nielson on Jan 20, 2017)</p><p>I have a number of chronic health issues, and as a result, health supplements are an important part of my health maintenance regimen. When I heard about Pure Polar, and the purported benefits of astaxanthin, I decided that I had to give this new product a try.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did! Almost from the first day that I started taking Pure Polar shrimp oil I noticed an increase in my energy level. I've only been consuming shrimp oil supplements for about a week, and am very hopeful of noticing additional improvements in my overall health with continued use.</p><p><strong><i>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</i></strong> (Christine on Nov 19, 2016)</p><p>I have been taking these Omega supplements for many months now. I enjoy their health benefits. I no longer have back aches and find I have a lot more energy as well. I am a new life long client.</p><p><strong><i>GREAT RESULTS!</i></strong> (Greg Aubry on Oct 18, 2016)</p><p>Unfortunately I suffer from a medical condition that causes swelling of my feet and extreme pain in my knees. Some attacts last a day while others last a week. The severity ranges from limping to being totally bedridden. My Dr. suggested adding Omega 3 and after research I found Pure Polar Double Strength.<br/>I have been taking 2 pills daily for about a year and double the dosage if I start to feel swelling. Have not used a cane or crutches since I started .<br/>Personally I think this is a wonder drug and I tell friends to try it for a month. Everyone who does swears by it.<br/>As a side note this is the first time I have every written a review so sorry it was so long.</p><p><strong><i>MY ANKLES DON'T ACH ANY MORE</i></strong> (William Curry on Oct 15, 2016)</p><p>I’m 68 and have been suffering for years with aching ankles after every round of golf or after playing tennis or taking long walks. A friend recommended Pure Polar and I have been taking it for about 3 months instead of my normal vitamins and energy supplements. It must be the reason why my muscles and ankles don’t ache after sports. Glad I found this product and my wife is finding the same success for her shoulders and arms.

The shrimp are originally caught in a SUSTAINABLE CERTIFIED fishery in the North Atlantic Ocean.  Once caught in the ocean, the shrimp are brought to on-shore processors who cook & peel the shrimp, sell the meat and discard the shell waste in landfills. This has been standard practice for decades. In this video from the popular Discovery Channel Show, ""Coldwater Cowboys"", you will get a glimpse of how the North Atlantic Shrimp are caught by Newfoundland fishermen: Here's where Pure Polar Labs changes the course of history. We now take the shells from the processors before they are discarded and produce the shrimp oil. It's hard to imagine that there is oil in the shells. In fact the oil is less than 1% of the shells, but is highly nutritious (you'll learn more about shrimp oil's health benefits further below). We are just getting started on this journey to better your health and the health of our oceans. With your support, we believe that eventually we can convert 100% of all the shrimp shells from Newfoundland into shrimp oil products. Together we can ensure that over 10% of the total omega-3 market will be from SUSTAINABLE SHRIMP OIL. This is a great story of how together we can use all of our resources including waste resources to make great products to benefit both people and the environment. Our current brands: Pure Polar, Joint AX and Sport AX For more information visit purepolarlabs.com Here are some reviews from happy Pure Polar Shrimp Oil customers:SATISFIED 1ST TIME CUSTOMER (Bob McPherson on Apr 07, 2017)As a 60-year old former hockey player with several knee issues over the years and a weight problem to boot, I suffer from severe knee pain and have for the last year. My left knee has felt like a knife was imbedded in it. By starting a regular routine of taking the Pure Polar product, my knee pain has been reduced to the point where I can start to take long walks and not limp or experience long-standing periods of sharp pain. I believe that this product will enable me to battle the weight issue I have more effectively and continue to make all my joint problems a thing of the past. Thanks to Pure Polar and to Lou for the recommendation.SINGER (Madison Watkins on Mar 16, 2017)I am a singer who is on the road a lot. These pills have controlled my adrenals, allowed me to have more energy, and have made my body overall healthier. I am so grateful for these!NO MORE KNEE PAIN (Mark Ross on Mar 15, 2017)I just started running again after a long hiatus. I was afraid to start due to knee pain. I started running and started taking Polar on a recommendation from a friend. After a VERY short time - no more knee pain. Nothing - NADA. I feel 20 years younger.NO MORE JOINT PAIN (Jim Hall on Mar 02, 2017)I have suffered for years with a sore right shoulder joint. It is no longer painful and the only change is I have taken Pure Polar 2 pills per day for 3 months.A BRILLIANT SUPPLEMENT FOR A HEALTHIER LIFE (M A, MD on Feb 18, 2017)The amount of stress we place on our bodies during the course of lives is immense.We can all make due with a product that can help us revitalize. It has been clinically demonstrated that omega fatty acids can help improve our cholesterol levels, and thereby save us from experiencing debilitating diseases such as myocardial infarctions [commonly known as heart attacks] and cerebrovascular accidents [commonly known as strokes]. It can help improve mood by providing us with the adequate nutrtion that keep our nervous system intact. It can also help boost our immune systems.As a physician I would recommend Pure Polar to anyone looking to improve their health.HIGHER ENERGY LEVEL (Jeff Nielson on Jan 20, 2017)I have a number of chronic health issues, and as a result, health supplements are an important part of my health maintenance regimen. When I heard about Pure Polar, and the purported benefits of astaxanthin, I decided that I had to give this new product a try.I'm glad I did! Almost from the first day that I started taking Pure Polar shrimp oil I noticed an increase in my energy level. I've only been consuming shrimp oil supplements for about a week, and am very hopeful of noticing additional improvements in my overall health with continued use.I LOVE THIS PRODUCT (Christine on Nov 19, 2016)I have been taking these Omega supplements for many months now. I enjoy their health benefits. I no longer have back aches and find I have a lot more energy as well. I am a new life long client.GREAT RESULTS! (Greg Aubry on Oct 18, 2016)Unfortunately I suffer from a medical condition that causes swelling of my feet and extreme pain in my knees. Some attacts last a day while others last a week. The severity ranges from limping to being totally bedridden. My Dr. suggested adding Omega 3 and after research I found Pure Polar Double Strength.I have been taking 2 pills daily for about a year and double the dosage if I start to feel swelling. Have not used a cane or crutches since I started .Personally I think this is a wonder drug and I tell friends to try it for a month. Everyone who does swears by it.As a side note this is the first time I have every written a review so sorry it was so long.MY ANKLES DON'T ACH ANY MORE (William Curry on Oct 15, 2016)I’m 68 and have been suffering for years with aching ankles after every round of golf or after playing tennis or taking long walks. A friend recommended Pure Polar and I have been taking it for about 3 months instead of my normal vitamins and energy supplements. It must be the reason why my muscles and ankles don’t ache after sports. Glad I found this product and my wife is finding the same success for her shoulders and arms.

<h3>HANGONATOR Blocks Causes of a Hangover</h3>
<p>Most scientists believe that a hangover is driven by alcohol interfering with your body's natural balance of chemicals in a complex way. One hypothesis is that in order to process alcohol, your body must convert the enzyme NAD+ into an alternate form, NADH. With an excess buildup of NADH and insufficient quantities of NAD+, the thinking goes, your cells are no longer capable of efficiently performing a number of metabolic activities, everything from absorbing glucose from the blood to regulating electrolyte levels. But this hypothesis, has been contradicted by data: In studies, people with severe hangovers weren't found to have lower levels of electrolytes or glucose in their blood.</p>
<p>The simplest and most familiar explanation is that drinking alcohol cause’s dehydration, both because it acts as a diuretic, increasing urine production, and because people who are drinking heavily for multiple hours probably aren't drinking much water during that time period. But studies examining the link between dehydration and hangovers have turned up some surprising data. One, for instance, found no correlation between high levels of the hormones associated with dehydration and the severity of a hangover. It's most likely that dehydration accounts for some of the symptoms of a hangover <i>(dizziness, lightheadedness and thirst)</i> but there are other factors at work as well.</p>
<p>The most compelling theory, is that hangovers result from a buildup of acetaldehyde, a toxic compound, in the body. As the body processes alcohol, acetaldehyde is the very first byproduct, and it's estimated to be between 10 and 30 times as toxic as alcohol itself. In controlled studies, it's been found to cause symptoms such as sweating, skin flushing, nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p>Hangovers could also be driven by the way alcohol affects your immune system. Studies have found strong correlations between high levels of cytokines <i>(molecules that the immune system uses for signaling)</i> and hangover symptoms. Normally, the body might use cytokines to trigger a fever of inflammatory response to battle an infection, but it seems that excessive alcohol consumption can also provoke cytokine release, leading to symptoms like muscle aches, fatigue, headache or nausea, as well as cognitive effects like memory loss or irritation.</p>
<p>What this shows is; alcohol stops the healthy exchange of information between cells, contributing to hangover symptoms.</p>

<h3>Why Are We On Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>We have been working on the HANGONATOR for nearly 3 years, investing our time and salaries on research and development. Over the past year we have crashed parties, invaded night clubs, attended events and given out thousands of patches.  We've followed up with and interviewed 100s of participants, all in an effort to test and perfect the product. Our activities have proven over and over that the HANGONATOR works, it eliminates the symptoms of hangovers. </p>
<p>During the last six months we have confirmed relationships with all of our vendors, including 3M.  We have done industry studies, and we all know how big this market is. We've communicated with multiple retailers, we've traveled around the world, created relationships with international alcohol resellers and developed international sales and marketing strategies. Last week we hosted a webinar, spoke to entrepreneurs, international resellers, nightclub owners, hospitality industry and alcohol retailers who have tested the product, they were all impressed with the results and are ready to purchase quanities.</p>
<p>We are ready to place our first volume order and launch HANGONATOR to the public.  We need to raise $110,000 to order, receive a container of the product and ship patches to backers, resellers and customers.  The container will allow us to develop a relationship with you, our backers, we will fill thousands of orders and it will fund our next container.</p>
<p>If we happen to fall short of our goal, we will ship orders to the backers who contributed as we believe the word of mouth from that alone, will give us the demand we need to continue on.</p>

<p>Statistics and information from experts around the world, send many mixed signals when it comes to drinking and your health. The truth is, all of this information means little in the real world, because hangovers have little to do with your overall health. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 86.4 percent of people ages 18 or older reported that they drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime; 70.1 percent reported that they drank in the past year; 56.0 percent reported that they drank in the past month. The numbers around the world are similar.</p>
<p><strong>The real question is not do you drink?</strong>  We know the answer is probably yes. </p>
<p>Assuming you do and hangovers are a concern. Wouldn't you want to be hangover free, especially if you could do it without side effects? </p>
<p>Every other hangover remedy asks you to put something else in your body, a pill or some type of supplement, the HANGONATOR has no ingredients and there is  nothing to ingest.</p>
<p>So, in the real world, if you are off work leaving the office or in the middle of your weekend, there are <strong>2 questions</strong> that really matter. </p>
<p><strong>1. Are you going to drink tonight?<br/>2. Do you have to wake up early tomorrow?</strong></p>
<p>There are times when the answer to both questions is yes. Your intention may be not to have more than one or two drinks, sometimes two can be more than enough, but there are those nights when the morning comes faster than you want. </p>
<p><strong>You can be sure that the HANGONATOR is seeking to block your hangover with relentless precision.</strong></p>
<p>We do not promote alcohol consumption, whether or not you drink, it is your choice, we know this personal decision is out of our control, we are neutral and non judgmental when it comes the topic, we stress that everyone drinks responsibly.</p>
<p><strong>Our mission is to help you minimize the effect of a hangover when you do.  </strong></p>
<p>So become a backer and refer your friends or just refer your friends to us.  You can always help people that you know who may struggle with hangovers, and tell them about the HANGONATOR, they will be happy you did.</p>
<p>Your contribution will have an effect on the lives of people around the world, for years to come.</p>

HANGONATOR Blocks Causes of a Hangover
Most scientists believe that a hangover is driven by alcohol interfering with your body's natural balance of chemicals in a complex way. One hypothesis is that in order to process alcohol, your body must convert the enzyme NAD+ into an alternate form, NADH. With an excess buildup of NADH and insufficient quantities of NAD+, the thinking goes, your cells are no longer capable of efficiently performing a number of metabolic activities, everything from absorbing glucose from the blood to regulating electrolyte levels. But this hypothesis, has been contradicted by data: In studies, people with severe hangovers weren't found to have lower levels of electrolytes or glucose in their blood.
The simplest and most familiar explanation is that drinking alcohol cause’s dehydration, both because it acts as a diuretic, increasing urine production, and because people who are drinking heavily for multiple hours probably aren't drinking much water during that time period. But studies examining the link between dehydration and hangovers have turned up some surprising data. One, for instance, found no correlation between high levels of the hormones associated with dehydration and the severity of a hangover. It's most likely that dehydration accounts for some of the symptoms of a hangover (dizziness, lightheadedness and thirst) but there are other factors at work as well.
The most compelling theory, is that hangovers result from a buildup of acetaldehyde, a toxic compound, in the body. As the body processes alcohol, acetaldehyde is the very first byproduct, and it's estimated to be between 10 and 30 times as toxic as alcohol itself. In controlled studies, it's been found to cause symptoms such as sweating, skin flushing, nausea and vomiting.
Hangovers could also be driven by the way alcohol affects your immune system. Studies have found strong correlations between high levels of cytokines (molecules that the immune system uses for signaling) and hangover symptoms. Normally, the body might use cytokines to trigger a fever of inflammatory response to battle an infection, but it seems that excessive alcohol consumption can also provoke cytokine release, leading to symptoms like muscle aches, fatigue, headache or nausea, as well as cognitive effects like memory loss or irritation.
What this shows is; alcohol stops the healthy exchange of information between cells, contributing to hangover symptoms.
HANGONATOR keeps your body in balance and functioning as normal.​

Why Are We On Indiegogo?
We have been working on the HANGONATOR for nearly 3 years, investing our time and salaries on research and development. Over the past year we have crashed parties, invaded night clubs, attended events and given out thousands of patches.  We've followed up with and interviewed 100s of participants, all in an effort to test and perfect the product. Our activities have proven over and over that the HANGONATOR works, it eliminates the symptoms of hangovers. 
During the last six months we have confirmed relationships with all of our vendors, including 3M.  We have done industry studies, and we all know how big this market is. We've communicated with multiple retailers, we've traveled around the world, created relationships with international alcohol resellers and developed international sales and marketing strategies. Last week we hosted a webinar, spoke to entrepreneurs, international resellers, nightclub owners, hospitality industry and alcohol retailers who have tested the product, they were all impressed with the results and are ready to purchase quanities.
We are ready to place our first volume order and launch HANGONATOR to the public.  We need to raise $110,000 to order, receive a container of the product and ship patches to backers, resellers and customers.  The container will allow us to develop a relationship with you, our backers, we will fill thousands of orders and it will fund our next container.
If we happen to fall short of our goal, we will ship orders to the backers who contributed as we believe the word of mouth from that alone, will give us the demand we need to continue on.
We are providing an opportunity here for you to help us bring this valuable product to the public, by getting your own supply at a huge discount.  So if you drink and you want to reduce the impact of hangovers in your life, take advantage of one of our packages.

The Team


It is Not Our Goal to Contribute to Alcohol Consumption,
A Mission to Improve the Lives of Those that Do Drink!

Statistics and information from experts around the world, send many mixed signals when it comes to drinking and your health. The truth is, all of this information means little in the real world, because hangovers have little to do with your overall health.  
According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 86.4 percent of people ages 18 or older reported that they drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime; 70.1 percent reported that they drank in the past year; 56.0 percent reported that they drank in the past month. The numbers around the world are similar.
The real question is not do you drink?  We know the answer is probably yes. 
Assuming you do and hangovers are a concern. Wouldn't you want to be hangover free, especially if you could do it without side effects? 
Every other hangover remedy asks you to put something else in your body, a pill or some type of supplement, the HANGONATOR has no ingredients and there is  nothing to ingest.
So, in the real world, if you are off work leaving the office or in the middle of your weekend, there are 2 questions that really matter. 
1. Are you going to drink tonight?2. Do you have to wake up early tomorrow?
There are times when the answer to both questions is yes. Your intention may be not to have more than one or two drinks, sometimes two can be more than enough, but there are those nights when the morning comes faster than you want. 
You can be sure that the HANGONATOR is seeking to block your hangover with relentless precision.
We do not promote alcohol consumption, whether or not you drink, it is your choice, we know this personal decision is out of our control, we are neutral and non judgmental when it comes the topic, we stress that everyone drinks responsibly.
Our mission is to help you minimize the effect of a hangover when you do.  
So become a backer and refer your friends or just refer your friends to us.  You can always help people that you know who may struggle with hangovers, and tell them about the HANGONATOR, they will be happy you did.
Your contribution will have an effect on the lives of people around the world, for years to come.

Patients from anywhere in the world can now choose any hospital based on their search on gmedicaltreatment.com site, create their health profiles, upload their health reports,  book appointments and do a lot more, with just one click.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>The Requirement</u></strong></p><p>A sum of $ 150,000 has already been invested into the development of the portal, gmedicaltreatment.com. This amount has been used to create the search engine that provides information about treatments and diagnostic facilities offered by 500 hospitals across 30 different countries. We intend to extend our network so as to include all top hospitals across the world.</p><p>We are presently short of just $10,000 more to hire a few experts who can fine-tune the system and market the whole concept to create awareness among patients and include a maximum number of hospitals in the network.</p><p>If 100 people can make a contribution of $100 each towards our system, the objective of providing access to safe, affordable and quality healthcare to everyone across the world, can be achieved successfully.</p><p><strong><u>How Does It Work?</u></strong></p><p>Almost every top hospital across the world would want to cater to international patients on a regular basis. Most top hospitals allocate about 15% to 25% of their budget for international marketing. By joining hands with gmedicaltreatment.com these hospitals can be saving up on their marketing expenses and get international patients on a regular basis.</p><p>In return, we negotiate with these hospitals to offer us a discount of 15% only. Out of this, 10% discount will be offered to the patients (users of gmedicaltreatment.com), 3% will be distributed among the group of Global Medical Tourism for administrative cost and 2% will be adjusted towards the system cost. So, if a patient who goes through gmedicaltreatment.com spends about $20,000 on his medical treatment, he will get a discount of $2,000.</p><p>Those who donate $100 through this campaign will be given the complete discount of 15%. So the savings they get on a treatment cost of $20,000 increase to $3,000.</p><p><strong><u>Why Contribute?</u></strong></p><p>By donating a mere $100 towards this campaign, you can help us achieve the following objectives:</p><ul>
<li>Put an end to deaths that happen due to unavailability of medical treatments</li>
<li>Help more and more people afford quality medical treatments</li>
<li>Enable people to undergo elective/optional treatments that are not covered by their insurance policies</li>
<li>Create a one-window healthcare system that people from the entire world can benefit from</li>
<li>Make sure health choices are not left to chance outcomes, anymore</li>
</ul><p><strong><u>What’s In It For You? </u></strong></p><p>The $100 that you contribute towards this campaign can get you a whopping 15% discount on your own medical treatments, which you can avail through gmedicaltreatment.com. This translates to a huge savings of $3,000 on a treatment that costs $20,000.</p><p>Also you will receive a nice T-shirt in your mailing address as a gift.</p><p><strong><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></strong></p><p>If you cannot contribute $100 towards this campaign, you can even contribute $50, $25 or $10. There are also other ways you can help.</p><p>You can share the campaign details on your social media page, email to your friends and spread to the word across.

However, in case we are unable to collect this $10,000 or even $5000 through this campaign, we will still keep working towards achieving our objectives. It might only take a little longer.</p><p>That said, we sincerely believe that a campaign as noble as this deserves success.</p><p><strong><u>The Impact</u></strong></p><p>Making this world healthy is not something that is in our hands. But through this platform, we can definitely make sure people can get access to safe, affordable and quality medical treatments whenever they are in need, irrespective of where they are.</p><ul>
<li>Not being able to afford medical treatments will not be the cause of death anymore, with this campaign becoming successful</li>
<li>Not having health insurance or adequate coverage will no longer discourage people from availing critical or for that matter even elective or optional treatments</li>
<li>Traveling to other countries for medical treatments becomes easier, convenient and hassle-free. For instance, a patient from Asia (Bangladesh) or Africa (Ethiopia) can easily avail medical treatments at India, Thailand or Malaysia if those treatments are not available or affordable in their country.</li>
<li>No longer would people, especially Canadian patients, have to wait for long periods to get their surgeries done. They can get them done at Singapore, Thailand or Mexico without wasting any time.</li>
<li>Patients from USA can enjoy huge savings on their treatments by availing them in other countries.</li>

*all figures in US DollarsSome Startling Facts & Figures
Although health insurance is one thing Americans rely upon for the medical treatments, there are about 30 million Americans who are not insured.
270 million Americans have to pay a major portion of their medical costs from their pockets, despite being insured. While some of these are on limited benefit medical plan, the others have restricted coverage because of pre-existing conditions.
334 million North Americans who have been seeking cosmetic and dental surgeries are discouraged from availing treatments because they are highly expensive in their country.
34 million Canadians have to wait for long periods even for common surgeries.
A platform like gmedicaltreatment.com gives easy access to affordable, safe and quality healthcare beyond linguistic, geographic, race and cost barriers. Patients from anywhere in the world can now choose any hospital based on their search on gmedicaltreatment.com site, create their health profiles, upload their health reports,  book appointments and do a lot more, with just one click. The RequirementA sum of $ 150,000 has already been invested into the development of the portal, gmedicaltreatment.com. This amount has been used to create the search engine that provides information about treatments and diagnostic facilities offered by 500 hospitals across 30 different countries. We intend to extend our network so as to include all top hospitals across the world.We are presently short of just $10,000 more to hire a few experts who can fine-tune the system and market the whole concept to create awareness among patients and include a maximum number of hospitals in the network.If 100 people can make a contribution of $100 each towards our system, the objective of providing access to safe, affordable and quality healthcare to everyone across the world, can be achieved successfully.How Does It Work?Almost every top hospital across the world would want to cater to international patients on a regular basis. Most top hospitals allocate about 15% to 25% of their budget for international marketing. By joining hands with gmedicaltreatment.com these hospitals can be saving up on their marketing expenses and get international patients on a regular basis.In return, we negotiate with these hospitals to offer us a discount of 15% only. Out of this, 10% discount will be offered to the patients (users of gmedicaltreatment.com), 3% will be distributed among the group of Global Medical Tourism for administrative cost and 2% will be adjusted towards the system cost. So, if a patient who goes through gmedicaltreatment.com spends about $20,000 on his medical treatment, he will get a discount of $2,000.Those who donate $100 through this campaign will be given the complete discount of 15%. So the savings they get on a treatment cost of $20,000 increase to $3,000.Why Contribute?By donating a mere $100 towards this campaign, you can help us achieve the following objectives:
Put an end to deaths that happen due to unavailability of medical treatments
Help more and more people afford quality medical treatments
Enable people to undergo elective/optional treatments that are not covered by their insurance policies
Create a one-window healthcare system that people from the entire world can benefit from
Make sure health choices are not left to chance outcomes, anymore
What’s In It For You? The $100 that you contribute towards this campaign can get you a whopping 15% discount on your own medical treatments, which you can avail through gmedicaltreatment.com. This translates to a huge savings of $3,000 on a treatment that costs $20,000.Also you will receive a nice T-shirt in your mailing address as a gift.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot contribute $100 towards this campaign, you can even contribute $50, $25 or $10. There are also other ways you can help.You can share the campaign details on your social media page, email to your friends and spread to the word across. If anyone from your social media network makes the $100 and more contribution towards this campaign, Please report us or we will track and we will make sure your incentive in exchange for your support.All Perks:$500 and more: One-night free stay at 4 or 5-star hotel and 15 % discount on treatment if you take services through our portal and that is $3000 saving*(Offer from selected hotels only)          (Qty – 5) $ 100: 15 % discount on treatment if you take services through our portal and that is $3000 saving* and a T-shirt will be ship to your mailing address (Qty – 300)$ 50: 10 % discount on treatment if you take services through our portal and that is $2000 saving* and a Hat will be ship to your mailing address     (Qty –100)$ 25:- 10 % discount on treatment if you take services through our portal and that is $2000 saving*      $ 10: Thanks with e-card       * We are assuming treatment cost is $ 20,000. Real saving will be calculated on the basis of your actual treatment cost. We don't own any hospitals, we just connect patients with right hospitals, as per their needs. You can donate us only if you believe our idea is good and we should succeed in our project development but you are not buying any product or services from us through this contribution but we are providing some gifts or rewards or trying to arrange discount for you if you take any treatment in any hospitals through our portal, in case any hospital disagree to give highest 15% discount, we will inform you that and we will try to give services to other hospital you prefer. The Worst Case ScenarioAll that we are asking is a $100 contribution by 100 people or any other contribution we mentioned in our parks. However, in case we are unable to collect this $10,000 or even $5000 through this campaign, we will still keep working towards achieving our objectives. It might only take a little longer.That said, we sincerely believe that a campaign as noble as this deserves success.The ImpactMaking this world healthy is not something that is in our hands. But through this platform, we can definitely make sure people can get access to safe, affordable and quality medical treatments whenever they are in need, irrespective of where they are.
Not being able to afford medical treatments will not be the cause of death anymore, with this campaign becoming successful
Not having health insurance or adequate coverage will no longer discourage people from availing critical or for that matter even elective or optional treatments
Traveling to other countries for medical treatments becomes easier, convenient and hassle-free. For instance, a patient from Asia (Bangladesh) or Africa (Ethiopia) can easily avail medical treatments at India, Thailand or Malaysia if those treatments are not available or affordable in their country.
No longer would people, especially Canadian patients, have to wait for long periods to get their surgeries done. They can get them done at Singapore, Thailand or Mexico without wasting any time.
Patients from USA can enjoy huge savings on their treatments by availing them in other countries.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Schluss mit Schwindel!</h2>
<p><strong>Schwindel</strong> – also die Wahrnehmung von Scheinbewegungen zwischen sich selbst und der Umwelt – ist keine Krankheit.</p>
<p><strong>Schwindel</strong> ist ein Symptom, wegen dem rund 30 % aller Menschen einmal im Leben in Behandlung sind – viele von ihnen dauerhaft.</p>
<p><strong>Schwindel</strong> ist das zweithäufigste Symptom in Arztpraxen – übertroffen nur von Schmerzen.</p>
<p>Unser Gleichgewichtssinn ist das Ergebnis eines äußerst komplexen Zusammenspiels verschiedener Sinne. Neben unserem Innenohr, sind auch unsere Augen und zahllose Lagerezeptoren in unseren Muskeln und Gelenken beteiligt. Die Ursache für Schwindel ist oftmals eine Störung des Gleichgewichtsorgans im Innenohr. Man spricht genauer vom vestibulären Schwindel. Er ist häufig chronisch, mit enormen Auswirkungen auf die Lebensqualität. Einfachste alltägliche Aktivitäten wie Fahrradfahren und Treppen steigen werden für Betroffene unmöglich.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525243940/wzibdjgq1wgaa4a1fpm2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>EQUIFit bringt dich ins Gleichgewicht!</h2>
<p>Glücklicherweise ist der vestibuläre Schwindel sehr gut behandelbar, denn das menschliche Gehirn ist extrem anpassungsfähig und kann den Ausfall des Gleichgewichtsorgans ausgleichen. Die Therapieform mit den besten Aussichten auf langfristigen Erfolg ist strukturiertes Gleichgewichtstraining, wodurch unser Gehirn lernt die Informationen wieder richtig zu verarbeiten. Wie jedes Training muss Gleichgewichtstraining jedoch dauerhaft durchgeführt werden und Erfolge stellen sich nur langsam ein.</p>
<p>Hier hilft EQUIFit – Dein <strong>persönlicher Gleichgewichtstrainer mit Biofeedback für Zuhause.</strong> <br/>Die Symptome klingen <strong>schneller</strong> ab,<br/>die Trainingseinheiten können <strong>kürzer</strong> gehalten werden und<br/>der Effekt ist <strong>langanhaltender</strong> – auch für Menschen die schon länger unter Schwindel leiden.</p>
<p>EQUIFit ist ein medizintechnisches Produkt im Format eines handelsüblichen Kopfhörers, kann jedoch viel mehr. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520517391/pdqsgjdtnebxwdqapbkq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>Wie funktioniert das Biofeedback von EQUIFit?</strong></h2>
<p>Das Biofeedback über EQUIFit öffnet dem Anwender einen bewussten Zugang zur sonst unbewussten Verbindung von Gleichgewicht und Tiefensensibilität.</p>
<p>Die <strong>Tiefensensibilität</strong> ist eine komplexe Sinneswahrnehmung, mit der die Position und Bewegung unserer Gliedmaßen an das Gehirn übermittelt werden. Dadurch wissen wir beispielsweise wo unsere Füße unter dem Tisch stehen, auch wenn wir sie nicht sehen können.</p>
<p>EQUIFit erfasst durch seine Position direkt am Kopf die Informationen, die sonst unser Innenohr erfasst: Die relative Position des Kopfes und seine Bewegungen. Weicht der Anwender von der Gleichgewichtslage ab erhält er von EQUIFit ein akustisches Feedback und kann sich so gezielt wieder in die Gleichgewichtslage bringen.</p>
<p>Durch regelmäßiges Training lernt unsere Tiefenwahrnehmung diese Position zu bestimmen – der Schwindel verschwindet.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525434139/hy8emb2miw9net4trhrk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Warum EQUIFit?</h2>
<p>Bisher existieren am Markt lediglich Geräte für den Einsatz in Kliniken und Arztpraxen, die wegen Anschaffungspreisen von weit über 5.000 Euro und ihrer komplizierten Bedienung für die Heimanwendung völlig ungeeignet sind.</p>
<p>EQUIFit ist das erste System für Schwindeltherapie und Gleichgewichtstraining, das konsequent mit dem Anwender im Blick entwickelt wurde. Als einziges System ist es sofort einsatzbereit. Die intuitive Gestensteuerung und der Audioguide (Deutsch, Englisch, Spanisch und Französisch) führen den Anwender durch Konfiguration und Training.</p>
<p>Entwickelt und getestet in Zusammenarbeit mit Fraunhofer IMS, Universität Duisburg-Essen und einem Netzwerk von Hals-Nasen-Ohren-Ärzten ermöglicht EQUIFit eine Therapie <strong>ohne Medikamente und nichtinvasiv</strong>.</p>
<p>Eine große Schwachstelle bestehender Systeme ist, dass diese Systeme kein Training mit geschlossenen Augen ermöglichen. Unsere Augen werden dann für unser Gleichgewicht unverzichtbar. Bei Dunkelheit oder wenn wir die Augen schließen, treten dann jedoch sofort wieder heftige Schwindelattacken auf.</p>
<p>EQUIFit löst dieses Problem über akustisches Biofeedback, denn unser Gehör ist von Natur aus eng an das Gleichgewichtssystem angebunden. Das akustische Feedback ist für unser Gehirn besonders leicht zu interpretieren. Durch das akustische Feedback von EQUIFit werden Reflexe trainiert und Betroffene reagieren wieder automatisch richtig.</p>
<p>EQUIFit passt sich dynamisch dem Trainingsfortschritt an und wählt jeweils den passenden Schwierigkeitsgrad aus – das Training ist so jederzeit sicher und effizient.</p>
<p>Das Herz von EQUIFit – die Elektronik – wurde komplett in Deutschland entwickelt und wird auch weiterhin hier produziert und montiert.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Historie</h2>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525244411/n0l1gxsvmivewrtj5ovm.png"" src=""""/></h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>Wem hilft EQUIFit?</h2>
<p>Schwindel betrifft viele Menschen jeden Alters. Dem wird die aktuelle Versorgungssituation jedoch nicht gerecht. Derzeit gibt es keine Möglichkeiten für Betroffene regelmäßig unter Anleitung ihr Gleichgewicht zu trainieren, da hierfür tägliche Besuche bei Ärzten oder Physiotherapeuten notwendig wären. Zudem verfügen nur wenige Ärzte über die notwendige technische Ausstattung, da diese extrem teuer ist.</p>
<p>Deshalb haben wir die Produktfamilie EQUIVert entwickelt: neben EQUIFit gehört dazu auch EQUIMedi. EQUIMedi hilft Ärzten mittels der Software EQUISoft ihre Diagnose auf eine objektive Grundlage zu stellen. Damit schaffen wir die Grundlage für bessere Diagnosen und eine passende Therapie für mehr Lebensqualität.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525244640/q2comdzgxy4aa5suwsdc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Warum brauchen wir deine Unterstützung?</h2>
<p>Wir sind überzeugt von EQUIVert und unserer Mission Schwindelpatienten zu mehr Lebensqualität zu verhelfen. Deswegen arbeiten wir seit rund fünf Jahren daran EQUIFit und EQUIMedi auf den Markt zu bringen und sind dabei bereits sehr weit gekommen.</p>
<p>Die strengen Anforderungen des Medizinproduktegesetzes machen die Entwicklung allerdings sehr teuer. Wir mussten uns nicht nur aufwändig als Hersteller von Medizinprodukten zertifizieren lassen. Die hohen Hürden für Medizinprodukte sorgen auch dafür, dass wir keinen auf dem Markt befindlichen Kopfhörer einfach aufrüsten können. Viele Produkte genügen nicht den strengen Auflagen, die beispielsweise an die Schadstoffbelastung gestellt werden. Dazu kommt: sollte der Hersteller auch nur kleine Änderungen vornehmen erlischt unsere Zulassung.</p>
<p>Um EQUIFit auch in Zukunft zuverlässig anbieten zu können haben wir uns deshalb entschieden einen eigenen Kopfhörer zu entwickeln, der extra nach unseren Vorgaben produziert wird. Dies ist natürlich mit weiteren Kosten verbunden, da allein die Gussform (das sog. Serienwerkzeug) für die Kunststoffteile über 20.000 EUR kostet. </p>
<p>Wir laden euch ein, mit uns den nächsten Schritt zu gehen. Mit eurer Unterstützung können wir endlich in die Serienproduktion gehen und zeigen, dass Schwindel kein Schicksal ist. Deshalb haben wir uns für ein flexibles Fundingziel entschieden. Jede Unterstützung zählt!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Was passiert mit eurem Geld bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung?</h2>
<p>Nach erfolgreichem Abschluss der Kampagne können wir direkt in Serienproduktion gehen und bereits ab September 2018 mit der Auslieferung der ersten EQUIFit beginnen.</p>
<p>Wir planen mittelfristig neben dem Direktvertrieb weitere Vertriebspartnerschaften aufzubauen und weitere Funktionen zu implementieren.</p>
<p>Mit eurer Unterstützung können wir folgende weitere Schritte gemeinsam mit euch gehen:</p>

Schluss mit Schwindel!
Schwindel – also die Wahrnehmung von Scheinbewegungen zwischen sich selbst und der Umwelt – ist keine Krankheit.
Schwindel ist ein Symptom, wegen dem rund 30 % aller Menschen einmal im Leben in Behandlung sind – viele von ihnen dauerhaft.
Schwindel ist das zweithäufigste Symptom in Arztpraxen – übertroffen nur von Schmerzen.
Unser Gleichgewichtssinn ist das Ergebnis eines äußerst komplexen Zusammenspiels verschiedener Sinne. Neben unserem Innenohr, sind auch unsere Augen und zahllose Lagerezeptoren in unseren Muskeln und Gelenken beteiligt. Die Ursache für Schwindel ist oftmals eine Störung des Gleichgewichtsorgans im Innenohr. Man spricht genauer vom vestibulären Schwindel. Er ist häufig chronisch, mit enormen Auswirkungen auf die Lebensqualität. Einfachste alltägliche Aktivitäten wie Fahrradfahren und Treppen steigen werden für Betroffene unmöglich.

EQUIFit bringt dich ins Gleichgewicht!
Glücklicherweise ist der vestibuläre Schwindel sehr gut behandelbar, denn das menschliche Gehirn ist extrem anpassungsfähig und kann den Ausfall des Gleichgewichtsorgans ausgleichen. Die Therapieform mit den besten Aussichten auf langfristigen Erfolg ist strukturiertes Gleichgewichtstraining, wodurch unser Gehirn lernt die Informationen wieder richtig zu verarbeiten. Wie jedes Training muss Gleichgewichtstraining jedoch dauerhaft durchgeführt werden und Erfolge stellen sich nur langsam ein.
Hier hilft EQUIFit – Dein persönlicher Gleichgewichtstrainer mit Biofeedback für Zuhause. Die Symptome klingen schneller ab,die Trainingseinheiten können kürzer gehalten werden undder Effekt ist langanhaltender – auch für Menschen die schon länger unter Schwindel leiden.
EQUIFit ist ein medizintechnisches Produkt im Format eines handelsüblichen Kopfhörers, kann jedoch viel mehr. 

Wie funktioniert das Biofeedback von EQUIFit?
Das Biofeedback über EQUIFit öffnet dem Anwender einen bewussten Zugang zur sonst unbewussten Verbindung von Gleichgewicht und Tiefensensibilität.
Die Tiefensensibilität ist eine komplexe Sinneswahrnehmung, mit der die Position und Bewegung unserer Gliedmaßen an das Gehirn übermittelt werden. Dadurch wissen wir beispielsweise wo unsere Füße unter dem Tisch stehen, auch wenn wir sie nicht sehen können.
EQUIFit erfasst durch seine Position direkt am Kopf die Informationen, die sonst unser Innenohr erfasst: Die relative Position des Kopfes und seine Bewegungen. Weicht der Anwender von der Gleichgewichtslage ab erhält er von EQUIFit ein akustisches Feedback und kann sich so gezielt wieder in die Gleichgewichtslage bringen.
Durch regelmäßiges Training lernt unsere Tiefenwahrnehmung diese Position zu bestimmen – der Schwindel verschwindet.

Warum EQUIFit?
Bisher existieren am Markt lediglich Geräte für den Einsatz in Kliniken und Arztpraxen, die wegen Anschaffungspreisen von weit über 5.000 Euro und ihrer komplizierten Bedienung für die Heimanwendung völlig ungeeignet sind.
EQUIFit ist das erste System für Schwindeltherapie und Gleichgewichtstraining, das konsequent mit dem Anwender im Blick entwickelt wurde. Als einziges System ist es sofort einsatzbereit. Die intuitive Gestensteuerung und der Audioguide (Deutsch, Englisch, Spanisch und Französisch) führen den Anwender durch Konfiguration und Training.
Entwickelt und getestet in Zusammenarbeit mit Fraunhofer IMS, Universität Duisburg-Essen und einem Netzwerk von Hals-Nasen-Ohren-Ärzten ermöglicht EQUIFit eine Therapie ohne Medikamente und nichtinvasiv.
Eine große Schwachstelle bestehender Systeme ist, dass diese Systeme kein Training mit geschlossenen Augen ermöglichen. Unsere Augen werden dann für unser Gleichgewicht unverzichtbar. Bei Dunkelheit oder wenn wir die Augen schließen, treten dann jedoch sofort wieder heftige Schwindelattacken auf.
EQUIFit löst dieses Problem über akustisches Biofeedback, denn unser Gehör ist von Natur aus eng an das Gleichgewichtssystem angebunden. Das akustische Feedback ist für unser Gehirn besonders leicht zu interpretieren. Durch das akustische Feedback von EQUIFit werden Reflexe trainiert und Betroffene reagieren wieder automatisch richtig.
EQUIFit passt sich dynamisch dem Trainingsfortschritt an und wählt jeweils den passenden Schwierigkeitsgrad aus – das Training ist so jederzeit sicher und effizient.
Das Herz von EQUIFit – die Elektronik – wurde komplett in Deutschland entwickelt und wird auch weiterhin hier produziert und montiert.
 
Historie

 
Wem hilft EQUIFit?
Schwindel betrifft viele Menschen jeden Alters. Dem wird die aktuelle Versorgungssituation jedoch nicht gerecht. Derzeit gibt es keine Möglichkeiten für Betroffene regelmäßig unter Anleitung ihr Gleichgewicht zu trainieren, da hierfür tägliche Besuche bei Ärzten oder Physiotherapeuten notwendig wären. Zudem verfügen nur wenige Ärzte über die notwendige technische Ausstattung, da diese extrem teuer ist.
Deshalb haben wir die Produktfamilie EQUIVert entwickelt: neben EQUIFit gehört dazu auch EQUIMedi. EQUIMedi hilft Ärzten mittels der Software EQUISoft ihre Diagnose auf eine objektive Grundlage zu stellen. Damit schaffen wir die Grundlage für bessere Diagnosen und eine passende Therapie für mehr Lebensqualität.

 
Warum brauchen wir deine Unterstützung?
Wir sind überzeugt von EQUIVert und unserer Mission Schwindelpatienten zu mehr Lebensqualität zu verhelfen. Deswegen arbeiten wir seit rund fünf Jahren daran EQUIFit und EQUIMedi auf den Markt zu bringen und sind dabei bereits sehr weit gekommen.
Die strengen Anforderungen des Medizinproduktegesetzes machen die Entwicklung allerdings sehr teuer. Wir mussten uns nicht nur aufwändig als Hersteller von Medizinprodukten zertifizieren lassen. Die hohen Hürden für Medizinprodukte sorgen auch dafür, dass wir keinen auf dem Markt befindlichen Kopfhörer einfach aufrüsten können. Viele Produkte genügen nicht den strengen Auflagen, die beispielsweise an die Schadstoffbelastung gestellt werden. Dazu kommt: sollte der Hersteller auch nur kleine Änderungen vornehmen erlischt unsere Zulassung.
Um EQUIFit auch in Zukunft zuverlässig anbieten zu können haben wir uns deshalb entschieden einen eigenen Kopfhörer zu entwickeln, der extra nach unseren Vorgaben produziert wird. Dies ist natürlich mit weiteren Kosten verbunden, da allein die Gussform (das sog. Serienwerkzeug) für die Kunststoffteile über 20.000 EUR kostet. 
Wir laden euch ein, mit uns den nächsten Schritt zu gehen. Mit eurer Unterstützung können wir endlich in die Serienproduktion gehen und zeigen, dass Schwindel kein Schicksal ist. Deshalb haben wir uns für ein flexibles Fundingziel entschieden. Jede Unterstützung zählt!
 
Was passiert mit eurem Geld bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung?
Nach erfolgreichem Abschluss der Kampagne können wir direkt in Serienproduktion gehen und bereits ab September 2018 mit der Auslieferung der ersten EQUIFit beginnen.
Wir planen mittelfristig neben dem Direktvertrieb weitere Vertriebspartnerschaften aufzubauen und weitere Funktionen zu implementieren.
Mit eurer Unterstützung können wir folgende weitere Schritte gemeinsam mit euch gehen:

<h3>Arginine and health</h3>
<p>Arginine, an amino acid is integrally related to health and well-being. A regular intake of arginine helps you to maintain a healthy and medication-free lifestyle. In this publication series, we will focus on the main functions of arginine in the human metabolism.</p>
<p>Arginine, an amino acid, has been the subject of intensive medical research for more than two decades. It has also gained increasing popularity as a nutritional supplement. However, the publicly available information on arginine is often fragmented and outdated. Our goal is to publish a series of popular science publications on arginine and its health benefits. This publication series will give the reader a broader view of human metabolism and the importance of arginine in everyday life.</p>
<p>We warmly recommend the use of arginine as a nutritional supplement. However, in this series, we do not endorse any specific arginine products.</p>

<h3>Arginine and Health publication series</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gives a broad understanding of the importance of arginine in maintaining a healthy metabolism.</li>
<li>Based on original research as well as thousands of peer-reviewed scientific articles.</li>
<li>Basic concepts presented are easy to understand and apply in daily life.</li>
<li>Real-life examples of the effects of arginine for different target groups.</li>
<li>Common misconceptions corrected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Arginine and Health series will consist the following publications:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1. Arginine - The Basics</strong></p>
<p>The first part in this series focuses on the basic facts about arginine, such as arginine as a chemical substance and the dietary sources of arginine. The authors introduce also some more advanced topics, such as the symptoms that should be regarded as warning signs of arginine deficiency, and the metabolic processes behind these symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2. Arginine and Circulation</strong></p>
<p>In the second part of the series, the authors show us why sufficient arginine levels are essential to a well-functioning cardiovascular system and to energy production in cells. These processes are viewed both at the micro and the macro level. The authors also discuss how these biochemical processes translate to a person's experience about their health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3. Arginine and the Immune Defense</strong></p>
<p>In this part of the series the focus is on the main functions of arginine in the immune system, and the relations between arginine deficiency and different illnesses. Stress and some demanding situations in life like pregnancy or overtraining can cause arginine deficiency. Even temporary arginine deficiency lowers the efficacy of our immune system, which can lead to a vicious cycle of infections and poor health. The authors tell us how arginine helps us to avoid such problems.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4. Arginine and the Nervous System</strong></p>
<p>In the fourth part, the main topics are stress and the autonomic nervous system. The authors show how sufficient arginine levels and nitric oxide production help our bodies to cope with stress. Also, the connections between prolonged stress, arginine deficiency and various illnesses are discussed.</p>
<strong>Part 5. Arginine and Mitochondria</strong><p>The final part in the series takes a look at the chain of energy production in the body. The authors show that arginine has a major role at certain parts of the chain, and discuss how arginine levels affect the energy production, and conditions like type 2 diabetes. The authors also define the Arginine Deficiency Syndrome.</p>

By 2050, 2 out of 3 people won't have access to potable water.
Our project, ACH2O, was created with the concept of developing a new source of drinkable water for the planet. 
ACH2O is  a filtering system that purifies the air conditioners wastewater and makes it fit for human consumption. We presented this technology to companies like Panasonic Ecuador. They joined our cause and have already sold thousands of ACH20 units along with the new ACs. ACH20 was awarded with 5 Cannes Lions and recognised as one of the most innovative ideas in the Product Design and Innovation categories. Now we want to make ACH20s accessible to those who can't purchase them. How it Works:

The A/C's exit vent is connected to a small water pump which expulses the water and starts the purification process.
The filter is composed by active carbon that eliminates bacteria and odors; silica sand which retains solids and carbonates that stabilize PH and eliminate other microorganisms. 
This process basically turns air conditioners into water fountains inside home and public spaces that people can use to drink water from.
Our main objective its that in the course of 5 years every AC in the world becomes a source of clean water.Our mission is to generate a new source of water for the planet.
What We Need:



We want to install 1000 ACH2O units for children in Ecuador. The plan is to install them across 200 schools in Guayaquil, one of the hottest cities in Ecuador.


We plan to raise 1 Million dollars in order to reach our goal. If we don't reach our goal, we aim to install as many ACH2O units with the amount of money raised.


Everytime we reach $1,000 we will be able to install one more ACH2O unit in a school.


The Impact:


By successfully installing  1000 ACH2Os we will be providing free potable water for  60,000 students.


Our plan is to install 5 ACH2Os per school, generating approximately 40,000 cups of water in each school every year. 


What You Get:

Every $1,000 dollars you donate, we will ship you a full functioning ACH2O unit for you to install in your home or office. (Perks will start being shipped starting Jan 1, 2016)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>Who
I am, what I do and why my work is urgently needed on our planet</b></h3><div><p>Hi, my name
is Andres Pellegrini and I’m a healer, speaker and author. In 2014 I published
in Switzerland <a href=""https://soundkugel.wordpress.com/buch/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the book “Heilung auf tiefster Ebene – Dem sexuellen Missbrauch ein Ende setzen”</a>; that means in English: “Healing on the deepest level – Ending
of the sexual abuse”. The book describes the healing of my own sexual trauma (I was sexually assaulted by my father, when I
was a baby and a little boy) in a way that inspires and
supports the reader on his own healing journey. In the movement of this book
release I liquidated my household, started to travel and to do my healing work in Switzerland, Corfu, Tenerife and New Zealand.</p></div>

I am, what I do and why my work is urgently needed on our planetHi, my name
is Andres Pellegrini and I’m a healer, speaker and author. In 2014 I published
in Switzerland the book “Heilung auf tiefster Ebene – Dem sexuellen Missbrauch ein Ende setzen”; that means in English: “Healing on the deepest level – Ending
of the sexual abuse”. The book describes the healing of my own sexual trauma (I was sexually assaulted by my father, when I
was a baby and a little boy) in a way that inspires and
supports the reader on his own healing journey. In the movement of this book
release I liquidated my household, started to travel and to do my healing work in Switzerland, Corfu, Tenerife and New Zealand.
Now's the time to work male specific! For that
reason I invite in my individual sessions and groups to HEALING ON THE DEEPEST LEVEL FOR MEN – a clear and soft approach of trauma healing that puts the heart qualities
in the centre, is grounded in Somatic Experiencing SE (Peter A. Levine’s trauma
healing work) and nourished by the wisdom of earth mother. Through dialog and
questions I invite men to reconnect with their real needs and to gently touch
and explore their own healing potential. 
As there’s still a gap of male specific healing approaches in the treatment
of sexual trauma HEALING ON THE DEEPEST LEVEL FOR MEN is urgently needed on our
planet.
With your
financial support I’m able to start creating healing spaces for men all over the world.
 

                                                                           
Your
money and my competence – a powerful combination!                                         
What your money allows me to do
The start-up capital of 50’000 Euro allows me to put all my energy and competence in my project until it is self-supporting. There is a lot of unpaid work to do, that needs a lot of time:Advertising

I promote my work mostly on my blog and on Facebook (posts and videos on
my page and in different groups as well as advertisements).Speaking on youtubeOn my youtube channel I talk about different aspects of sexual trauma and offer affected men simple healing-tools for everyday life. Writing  
In the
posts on my blog I give men a first taste of my healing work. Beside of that
I’m in the process of writing my second book “Healing on the deepest level for
men – For a dignified male sexuality”.

Research

I’m on the
way to transmit the deep wisdom of Somatic Experiencing SE to the physiology of
male sexual function. That will help to emerge on one hand how trauma affects this level
and on the other hand what kind of healing approaches are needed there. In addition
I explore indigenous healing approaches that can be very valuable in the
context of sexual trauma.
Networking

There are
two parts of networking:
1.  I connect with healers and organisations, who work
with the same issue, to build a deeper understanding of sexual healing in
general and to emerge the similarities and differences between the treatments
of men and women. Lately I created on FB a sharing group for healers: Male specific healing of sexual traumas - Sharing group for healers.
2.  I connect with affected men in FB
groups, that already exist (for example: MenThriving – Male survivors of sexual abuse). Lately I created on FB an English and a German
speaking sharing group for affected men: Healing of sexual traumas - Sharing group for affected men and Heilung von sexuellen Traumata - Austauschgruppe für betroffene Männer. Through videos from various sources I let affected men feel the enfolding of the world wide healing network. 

Organising

I
organise men’s groups. Beside creating a healing space, there are a lot of practical things to do, such as
finding and renting the right room, looking for accommodations, communication with the participants… 
My first
men’s group will take place in Corfu (GR) in summer 2016. 
Travelling

For connecting with other healers/organisations and finding the
right places for my men's groups I travel around the world.What you receive for your money
Spend and choose one of the healing perks! And if you
need none of the perks and just want to spent money you are very welcome to do

The
benefit of our powerful combination

Sexual Healing and Earth Healing are deeply
connected: if men can heal on the deepest level, our planet will heal on the
deepest level. If our planet can heal, men will heal. With our powerful combination we inspire and support this precious exchange between men and our
planet. And last but not least: men, who are deeply connected, are a gift for women.                                              
Challenges & Risks

challenge in the context of my project is the feeling of shame, that often paralyses

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Everyone!! My name is Sara Pickett, AKA ""PIK""  . I am a certified Personal trainer, Kickboxing instructor , martial artist, and  bomb sports massage therapist!!(If I may say so myself ) I became passionate about fitness when I was 18 years old. I have always  been an athlete, however it wasn't until  I meet my Mentor Billy blanks that I found my true passion. Billy taught me not only how to fight physically, but mentally. He instilled self discipline, focus, and a persevering spirit that I have carried with my throughout my life. Back then, I never knew that fitness was going to be my calling. Now at 36 years old, my passion has become my purpose. I now have 7 years of experience as a certified Tae Bo instructor, and 18 years of experience teaching in the fitness industry. After becoming a mother 9 years ago, and starting my own brand Fit by PIK, I realized my true passion was to help women build their confidence the way Billy did mine as he literally changed my life. Helping women stay fit while raising families is very important to me because I understand the unique challenges of working mothers , and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I have worked extremely hard these past 3 1/2 years to build the amazing team that I have while renting space out of other facilities. I have always envisioned the space that I want to someday create for my team and now that time is here! I am so excited for growth of our FBP Crew, and cannot wait to be able to provide more classes and a beautiful ambiance for all of you! The Fit by PIK Health club will  not only be a space where you can come get a incredible workout in, but a place where you can relax and recover as well. Your true go to spot. A place we can all call home. </p>

(estimate 2-3k) Interior and exterior paint. (trying to keep at 2k) and starting with one infrared sauna (we will have 2 eventually ) for now we are starting with the single seater for a more intimate , personalized feel. </p>
<p>- We will be the only private kickboxing studio/health club all in one! FBP Heath Club is geared towards women. However , we allow men into our facility on approved applications only. All men must apply. </p>

Designed by a US Navy Medic, The Fearless Finger uses the natural anti-microbial properties of copper to reduce your exposure and worries of contaminated surfaces by 99%.
 
Save the gloves for when you REALLY need them!
 
 

 
 
Be Clean, Be Fearless!
 
Doors, elevators, pin-pads, bathrooms ...
... if they're out in public, they're dirty just the same.
 
The Fearless Finger takes away any worries:  almost all of them, in fact!
 
 
 

 
 
 
Kills Threats In Minutes
 
We crafted the Fearless Finger out of copper alloy to pack a mean, antimicrobial punch.
 
Copper and other metals that contain it are extremely unfriendly to microbes.  
How can something so benign to us be so deadly to viruses?

 

A March 2020 study found that SARS-CoV-2 began to adversely react within minutes of contact with copper, reaching zero detectable units within 4 hours.

Reclaim your freedom without the risk.

Packed Full Of Post-Pandemic Potential
 
Use the Optimistic Opener to crack open some cold ones after this all blows over.
We want the Fearless Finger to be one of the most useful tools you've ever had.
