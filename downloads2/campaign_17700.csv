And a bit of a mystery. <span>W<span>e
 are familiar with the facts and the mythology, but the inner life of 
the matriarch of one of the country’s most revered and reviled political
 dynasties -- how she coped with loss and grief while maintaining her 
public equanimity – has seemed a riddle.</span></span></p><p>Laurence Leamer’s (<u>The Kennedy Women</u>, <u>The Kennedy Men</u>, <u>Sons of Camelot</u>) intimate, one-character play about Rose Kennedy is set in the living room of the family’s Hyannis Port compound the week after Teddy’s fateful error on a bridge in Chappaquiddick<i>. </i>As Rose struggles to understand why the Kennedys suffered so much tragedy, we grapple with their star-crossed lives and come to a new understanding. Rose tells us the story in her own words, and we listen, laugh, and cry at her amazing life, faith, and courage. <br/></p><i>“What so excites the Nora’s Playhouse team is that ROSE presents
 a totally new vision of the Kennedy matriarch that will change forever 
the way people view not only Rose, but also the Kennedy family. Up until now 
Rose had been seen largely as a cypher, standing eternally at the back 
of the stage. That is not the Rose Kennedy of this play.”</i><br/>- Caroline Reddick Lawson, Co-Founder/Artistic Director of Nora's Playhouse<br/><br/>Following our successful stage reading at New York Theatre Workshop in 2014, we knew we had to bring this compelling story to a wider audience. Taking <i>ROSE</i> to Off-Broadway is by far the most ambitious project we have attempted. With input from some of New York’s leading theatre professionals, we have assembled an extraordinary team. The incomparable <b>Kathleen Chalfant </b>(<i>Wit</i>, <i>Angels in America</i>, <i>House of Cards, The Affair</i>) will play Rose. Legendary costume designer <b>Jane Greenwood</b> (nominated for 19 Tony Awards for Costume Design including in 2015 for <i>You Can't Take It With You</i>, recipient of the 2014 Special Tony for Lifetime Achievement) will dress Rose. And we are excited to announce that some of the most promising young theatre designers in America are joining our design team: <b>Anya Klepikov</b> (<i>Glass Menagerie</i>, Triad Stage) will create the mise en scene, <b>Caitlin Rapoport</b> (<i>Arcadia</i>, Yale Rep) will be doing our lighting design, and <b>Jane Shaw </b>(<i>Jackie, </i>Women's Project/City Center Stage II) will design the sound. Nora’s Playhouse Co-Founder and Artistic Director <b>Caroline Lawson </b>(<i>The Fallen</i>, Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre) directs.<br/><br/><p>We hope you will join the team with your financial commitment. Please help us to advance the cause of women in the theatre and change the way history views one of the most important women of the 20th century.

And then one after another we fell. And when I look up now I see no stars. I see no light. I see a sky full of darkness. But I do not look into that blackness. I look at what once was. And what forever more will be remembered.” -Rose Kennedy in ROSEThe women of Nora’s Playhouse need your help in producing our  inaugural Off-Broadway venture ROSE, a groundbreaking new play about the Kennedy matriarch starring award-winning actress Kathleen Chalfant.Rose Kennedy is an American icon. And a bit of a mystery. We
 are familiar with the facts and the mythology, but the inner life of 
the matriarch of one of the country’s most revered and reviled political
 dynasties -- how she coped with loss and grief while maintaining her 
public equanimity – has seemed a riddle.Laurence Leamer’s (The Kennedy Women, The Kennedy Men, Sons of Camelot) intimate, one-character play about Rose Kennedy is set in the living room of the family’s Hyannis Port compound the week after Teddy’s fateful error on a bridge in Chappaquiddick. As Rose struggles to understand why the Kennedys suffered so much tragedy, we grapple with their star-crossed lives and come to a new understanding. Rose tells us the story in her own words, and we listen, laugh, and cry at her amazing life, faith, and courage. “What so excites the Nora’s Playhouse team is that ROSE presents
 a totally new vision of the Kennedy matriarch that will change forever 
the way people view not only Rose, but also the Kennedy family. Up until now 
Rose had been seen largely as a cypher, standing eternally at the back 
of the stage. That is not the Rose Kennedy of this play.”- Caroline Reddick Lawson, Co-Founder/Artistic Director of Nora's PlayhouseFollowing our successful stage reading at New York Theatre Workshop in 2014, we knew we had to bring this compelling story to a wider audience. Taking ROSE to Off-Broadway is by far the most ambitious project we have attempted. With input from some of New York’s leading theatre professionals, we have assembled an extraordinary team. The incomparable Kathleen Chalfant (Wit, Angels in America, House of Cards, The Affair) will play Rose. Legendary costume designer Jane Greenwood (nominated for 19 Tony Awards for Costume Design including in 2015 for You Can't Take It With You, recipient of the 2014 Special Tony for Lifetime Achievement) will dress Rose. And we are excited to announce that some of the most promising young theatre designers in America are joining our design team: Anya Klepikov (Glass Menagerie, Triad Stage) will create the mise en scene, Caitlin Rapoport (Arcadia, Yale Rep) will be doing our lighting design, and Jane Shaw (Jackie, Women's Project/City Center Stage II) will design the sound. Nora’s Playhouse Co-Founder and Artistic Director Caroline Lawson (The Fallen, Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre) directs.We hope you will join the team with your financial commitment. Please help us to advance the cause of women in the theatre and change the way history views one of the most important women of the 20th century. Join us on this extraordinary journey.This November, at The Clurman Theatre in New York City, Nora's Playhouse
 will bring ROSE to the stage for a limited engagement. The first preview is on November 21, 2015 and the show opens on November 29, 2015 for a two-week run. We are working passionately to make this

had been produced by David Spaulding (in association with ScriptsUp, a non for

Theater. David Spaulding then submitted it to 59E59 Theaters, a prestigious Off

<div>We're a group of actors, directors, teaching artists, and theatermakers who first met and worked together in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the University of the Arts. Since then, our adventures have taken us across the United States and overseas—to London, Australia, and Prague. T<span style=""background-color: initial;"">he theatre we made and saw in these places has nurtured our collective passion for cultural exchange and engaging communities in the theatrical process. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We now have an opportunity to do more of that exchanging and engaging—in Prague! We're going to produce <i>THIS GIRL LAUGHS, THIS GIRL CRIES, THIS GIRL DOES NOTHING</i> in the 2015<b> Prague Fringe Festival.</b></span><b style=""background-color: initial;""> </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We've got the venue secured and the playwright's blessing. Now, we just need to get the rest of our team to Prague. That's where you come in.</span>
</div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>About the play: </h3></b>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><i>THIS GIRL LAUGHS, THIS GIRL CRIES, THIS GIRL DOES NOTHING </i>is a wildly imaginative and profoundly humble play by Australian playwright Finegan Kruckemeyer. It is the recipient of the prestigious Rodney
Seaborn Playwrights Award and was first produced in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It has since been performed hundreds of times and in four different languages.</p>
<p><i>THIS GIRL LAUGHS, THIS GIRL CRIES, THIS GIRL DOES NOTHING </i>is a contemporary fairy tale about three sisters who are abandoned in the forest by their father and forced to find their own way in the world. One goes left, one goes right, and one stays right where she started.</p>
<blockquote>""This wood is a doorway to everything that's outside our house and our village and our childhood and our experiences. There may be bears out there... The only thing we can not do is go back. And that's okay—life is not for going back."" </blockquote>
<p>Kruckemeyer's play—about survival, finding yourself, and growing up—elegantly weaves together the fantastical and the everyday to narrate the separation of three sisters and the lifetime’s worth of stories they collect along their journeys home. <br/></p>
<h3><b>About our team:</b></h3>
<p>Our team is led by director BILL BUDDENDORF. Bill is a master of the Viewpoints technique, a highly imaginative, physically-focused method of creating character and story. This will be instrumental in mounting a production that transcends the barriers of language. Our production, though performed in English, will feature Czech supertitles.

</div></div>","What are we trying to do here? 
We're a group of actors, directors, teaching artists, and theatermakers who first met and worked together in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the University of the Arts. Since then, our adventures have taken us across the United States and overseas—to London, Australia, and Prague. The theatre we made and saw in these places has nurtured our collective passion for cultural exchange and engaging communities in the theatrical process. We now have an opportunity to do more of that exchanging and engaging—in Prague! We're going to produce THIS GIRL LAUGHS, THIS GIRL CRIES, THIS GIRL DOES NOTHING in the 2015 Prague Fringe Festival. We've got the venue secured and the playwright's blessing. Now, we just need to get the rest of our team to Prague. That's where you come in.




About the play: 


THIS GIRL LAUGHS, THIS GIRL CRIES, THIS GIRL DOES NOTHING is a wildly imaginative and profoundly humble play by Australian playwright Finegan Kruckemeyer. It is the recipient of the prestigious Rodney
Seaborn Playwrights Award and was first produced in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It has since been performed hundreds of times and in four different languages.
THIS GIRL LAUGHS, THIS GIRL CRIES, THIS GIRL DOES NOTHING is a contemporary fairy tale about three sisters who are abandoned in the forest by their father and forced to find their own way in the world. One goes left, one goes right, and one stays right where she started.
""This wood is a doorway to everything that's outside our house and our village and our childhood and our experiences. There may be bears out there... The only thing we can not do is go back. And that's okay—life is not for going back."" 
Kruckemeyer's play—about survival, finding yourself, and growing up—elegantly weaves together the fantastical and the everyday to narrate the separation of three sisters and the lifetime’s worth of stories they collect along their journeys home. 
About our team:
Our team is led by director BILL BUDDENDORF. Bill is a master of the Viewpoints technique, a highly imaginative, physically-focused method of creating character and story. This will be instrumental in mounting a production that transcends the barriers of language. Our production, though performed in English, will feature Czech supertitles. In addition to directing the play, Bill will introduce Viewpoints in a series of educational workshops with students at Prague Youth Theater. 
The cast includes BRANDI BURGESS, TAYLOR BOLES, LAURA EPPERSON, BRAD OGDEN, and SHANNON REMLEY. DANYA BARYSHNIKOV and RAQUEL GOLDSTEIN, two students of acting at Prague Youth Theatre, round out our company of actors.About Prague Fringe

2009 by myself and Mischa O' Mahony to facilitate the growth and 
development of budding actors and actresses with an intellectual 
disability. <br/></p>
<p>Rhythm Room runs weekly theatre workshops and  we make inclusive theatre. Our most recent work was CAN I FIT INTO THIS? at Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin in 2013. <br/></p>
<p><b>Love | Loss | Life </b>is a new play by Rhythm Room which will take to
the stage on the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> of November in the Axis Theatre, Dublin.
Weaving together original live music, digital media and theatre this is Rhythm
Room's most ambitious project to date. The work is completely original and both
the story and movement have been devised by the actors through Rhythm Room's process based approach.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>LOVE LOSS LIFE is set to the
rhythm of a heartbeat, it is a journey through life: death and disappointment,
loss and fear, pain and sadness, hope and courage, love and endurance.</p>
<p>Our
work is all about opening the door of the Arts to minority groups and
encouraging people's development creatively, imaginatively and socially through
the process of theatre. We have shown that we are capable of creating
interesting work that speaks to a wide audience and that we are able to deliver
it in a professional manner. We are constantly pushing ourselves out of our
comfort zone and want to bring our work to a wider audience.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We are not funded by any arts organisation and the money we make from ticket sales will help to pay for the cost of the production. We need €2000 to help us complete our project comfortably, this money will help pay for printing costs, costumes and venue insurance.<br/>
</div><div>In return for funding us you will get our sincere gratitude and depending on what you fund you can receive a signed programme, a ticket to the play or a Rhythm Room workshop for a group of your choice. <br/><br/><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Rhythm Room's approach is organic and inclusive. 
The idea for Love Loss Life began three years ago in our Thursday 
afternoon group. The Actors wanted to express their thoughts around the 
themes and from that point we began to develop the idea for the play. 
</p>
<p>In supporting our work you are enabling the wonderful performers at 
Rhythm Room to share their creation with a wider audience. In making a 
donation you are saying Yes! to Inclusive Theatre and providing an 
opportunity for Rhythm Room's growth and development.</p>

</div> <div><br/></div></div>","Short Summary Hi! My name is Nicola Kealy and I run Rhythm Room: A space for Inclusive Theatre. Rhythm Room was set up in 
2009 by myself and Mischa O' Mahony to facilitate the growth and 
development of budding actors and actresses with an intellectual 
disability. 
Rhythm Room runs weekly theatre workshops and  we make inclusive theatre. Our most recent work was CAN I FIT INTO THIS? at Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin in 2013. 
Love | Loss | Life is a new play by Rhythm Room which will take to
the stage on the 5th and 6th of November in the Axis Theatre, Dublin.
Weaving together original live music, digital media and theatre this is Rhythm
Room's most ambitious project to date. The work is completely original and both
the story and movement have been devised by the actors through Rhythm Room's process based approach.



LOVE LOSS LIFE is set to the
rhythm of a heartbeat, it is a journey through life: death and disappointment,
loss and fear, pain and sadness, hope and courage, love and endurance.
Our
work is all about opening the door of the Arts to minority groups and
encouraging people's development creatively, imaginatively and socially through
the process of theatre. We have shown that we are capable of creating
interesting work that speaks to a wide audience and that we are able to deliver
it in a professional manner. We are constantly pushing ourselves out of our
comfort zone and want to bring our work to a wider audience.
What We Need & What You GetWe are not funded by any arts organisation and the money we make from ticket sales will help to pay for the cost of the production. We need €2000 to help us complete our project comfortably, this money will help pay for printing costs, costumes and venue insurance.
In return for funding us you will get our sincere gratitude and depending on what you fund you can receive a signed programme, a ticket to the play or a Rhythm Room workshop for a group of your choice. The Impact Rhythm Room's approach is organic and inclusive. 
The idea for Love Loss Life began three years ago in our Thursday 
afternoon group. The Actors wanted to express their thoughts around the 
themes and from that point we began to develop the idea for the play. 

In supporting our work you are enabling the wonderful performers at 
Rhythm Room to share their creation with a wider audience. In making a 
donation you are saying Yes! to Inclusive Theatre and providing an 
opportunity for Rhythm Room's growth and development.

ministry and charity serving the New England area.</i></b><br/></p>
<p>Inspired by medieval charitable groups that used the
proceeds of theatre to support Madrid's hospitals for 300 years, we're designed
to be an arts group that gives rather than takes.</p>
<p><i><b>But we need a little help getting there.</b></i></p>
<p>Still Small is designed to be self-sustaining, with
proceeds from our shows being shared between our own needs and the needs of charitable
causes. Since 2013, we've done just that, supporting things like education
for low caste children, empowerment for local low-income families, and help for
persecuted Christians. We keep our costs low by working on a volunteer
basis and maintaining a minimalist aesthetic that puts the focus on the people
and the performance rather than the trappings of it. </p>
<p><b><i>This is where you come in!</i></b></p>
<p>In order to truly be self-sustaining, we need start-up
capital in order to pay for things like gas to get to shows, small stipends to
help our volunteers afford the time commitment, equipment like props, lights
and costumes, and operating and marketing costs. </p>
<p><b><i>Cool things have been happening ... </i></b></p>
<p>In addition to highlighting and supporting charitable
causes through our work, we've noticed a number of other benefits – some
expected, some less so! The combination of spiritual exercise with the close
interpersonal work of theatre has resulted in a uniquely strong community among
those who have worked with us, and participants frequently cite the experience
as one of the most powerful ones of their spiritual lives. Our actors with
disabilities, in particular, have also spoken movingly of the confidence,
encouragement, and empowerment they have gained from being part of this work. </p>
<p><b><i>... please help cool things continue for a long time!</i></b></p>
<p>The troupe has also pioneered numerous new
theatrical works since its inception, enriching the arts world and the
opportunities for audiences and participants throughout Massachusetts. Audience
members consistently comment on ways that God has used performances to touch,
challenge, and inspire them. In 2013, our production of <i>The Prophet
Project </i>was recognized with the Making a Difference in Christian
Service Award from Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary for drawing together
people from a variety of socioeconomic, ethnic, and denominational backgrounds
to produce high quality, Christ-centered theatre. We look forward to what He's
going to do next!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

In 2015, through the power of music and the love of dance, Individual Unit was founded. The Edmonton based group is undoubtedly one of the forces pushing Hip Hop culture. 
During the day, you can catch the trio teaching for free in downtown Edmonton, working with the youth, cyphering, travelling across Canada to participate in competitions, recording videos and exchanging ideas on how to improve circumstances amongst the community. Individual Unit has developed incredibly since they first met in 2012 and the collective consists of members that dance, produce music, and visual arts. Change The Game (CTG) is a dance camp merged with a dance competition. We are planning to go to Calgary from the 17th till the 22nd to partake in Change The Game. This would be life/career altering as it would allow us to connect with worldwide talent. With these new connections, we would be able to bring dancers to share with Edmonton and show them what our beautiful city has to offer.
   What We Need

Travel to Calgary: $250

Camp + Competition + Lodging: $2250
Includes



Unlimited Class Workshops


All Access to CTG Parties


Qualifier Dance Battles


Main Event CTG Finals

The Impact


 The reason we want to participate in this top tier event is because it will give us more knowledge and skills, that we are able to bring back to our city to spread among the community, and most importantly, to the youth, through our dance. Once we are able to better direct the youths and communities energies into art and culture, it will be an uplifting force, giving people an outlet for freedom of expression, and building the support to be able to accomplish their goals.

<p><b>Hello! My name is Georgette Verdin and I am the Co-Artistic Director of Interrobang Theatre Project.

<p><b><i>KATRINA: MOTHER-IN-LAW OF ‘EM ALL </i></b> written by New Orleans native, Rob Florence, is set in the famous Mother-in-Law Lounge, located in New Orleans’ Tremé neighborhood. It follows six individuals as they recount their true, harrowing and yet somehow hopeful stories about surviving one of the worst disasters in U.S. history. Both hilarious and poignant – this piece reaches beyond New Orleans, beyond Hurricane <span>Katrina, and taps into our primordial need as humans to survive even under the worst of conditions. </span></p>
<p><i><span>Katrina </span></i>is the first of three plays in Interrobang Theatre Project's sixth season entitled ‘Unnatural Disasters,’ in which we investigate how individuals and communities navigate their way through the chaos and absurdity of worlds turned upside-down. The power of <i><span>Katrina </span></i>lies in its up-close and personal accounts of ordinary people acting in heroic ways to save themselves and their neighbors. Rob's script bypasses the political debacles and media circus that was the storm coverage, and instead - through these stories - allows the audience an opportunity to experience the grit of folks trying to survive hour-by-hour.

<p>When the world turned against Ronald Reagan’s foreign policy, one woman came
to his defense: Jeane Kirkpatrick. The first woman to serve as America’s
ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane fought to make Reagan’s case
before the world community. Now, for the first time, the Reagan White House is the subject of a new play:

<h3>    The World Turned on Reagan's Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>The arms-for-hostages scandal cast a shadow over Ronald Reagan's foreign
policy. Jeane Kirkpatrick was in
conflict with Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's ambassador to the United Nations. <br/></p>

<h3>                           Nora: Jeane's Nemesis</h3>Jeane and Nora, mocked as “Amazonian Bitches” by delegates to the
male-dominated U.N., clashed in a war of words as each tried to sway world
public opinion. Their confrontations became legendary as they worked feverishly

<h3>                             Nancy Opines . . .<br/>
</h3>Nancy had none of it, blaming Jeane for the World Court ruling against the U.S. and for the ""arms-for-hostages"" becoming the ""Iran-Contra"" scandal. She demanded that Jeane neutralize that ""Nicaraguan Bitch,"" something Nancy felt would be easy to do, given that both Jeane and Nora were Sagittarians, and Sagittarians are good at slaying each other.<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>      Playwright Statement: The Power of Women<br/>
</h3>
<p>When Americans think of powerful Latin American women, they think of Frida Kahlo or Eva Peron. But there are scores of incredible women: Nora Astorga is one. A patriot who fought in the jungles as a guerrilla, she served her country as ambassador to the United Nations. That Jeane Kirkpatrick and Nora Astorga were the first women to represent their nations, the U.S. and Nicaragua, at a time when the nations were at conflict, created great drama--and gossip. The intervention of Nancy Reagan added to this volatile mix. This dark comedy is a tribute to pioneering women who used the United Nations as the stage to make their cases before the world community.</p>
<h3>

<p>And who the heck is Nora Astorga, you ask? <br/></p>
<p>Fund our reading and find out! Powerful and brilliant, she took on Jeane and held her own! Their clashes—<i>in the Ladies Room at the

                           Nora: Jeane's NemesisJeane and Nora, mocked as “Amazonian Bitches” by delegates to the
male-dominated U.N., clashed in a war of words as each tried to sway world
public opinion. Their confrontations became legendary as they worked feverishly
to prevail—each coming to respect the other before fate intervened. 
                                                  
                             Nancy Opines . . .
Nancy had none of it, blaming Jeane for the World Court ruling against the U.S. and for the ""arms-for-hostages"" becoming the ""Iran-Contra"" scandal. She demanded that Jeane neutralize that ""Nicaraguan Bitch,"" something Nancy felt would be easy to do, given that both Jeane and Nora were Sagittarians, and Sagittarians are good at slaying each other.


      Playwright Statement: The Power of Women

When Americans think of powerful Latin American women, they think of Frida Kahlo or Eva Peron. But there are scores of incredible women: Nora Astorga is one. A patriot who fought in the jungles as a guerrilla, she served her country as ambassador to the United Nations. That Jeane Kirkpatrick and Nora Astorga were the first women to represent their nations, the U.S. and Nicaragua, at a time when the nations were at conflict, created great drama--and gossip. The intervention of Nancy Reagan added to this volatile mix. This dark comedy is a tribute to pioneering women who used the United Nations as the stage to make their cases before the world community.

 
                   Kirkpatrick and Astorga Clash

And who the heck is Nora Astorga, you ask? 
Fund our reading and find out! Powerful and brilliant, she took on Jeane and held her own! Their clashes—in the Ladies Room at the 
U.N., no less—were legendary.

Great Stories Make Great Theater
Let’s bring on Jeane, Nora, Ronnie, and Nancy to the stage and let the sparks fly!                           About the Playwright:Educated at Cornell University, I'm an economist and writer. For two 
decades I worked in finance, primarily at private banks and other 
financial institutions. During this time I wrote more than 20 books. At 
Cornell I studied play writing under Paula Vogel. And recently, I've 
turned to writing plays. My interest is in writing pieces about strong, 
courageous women. HER EXCELLENCY is about Jeane Kirkpatrick and Nora 
Astorga, a political dark comedy. At present I'm developing a piece, 
which would be the first for either of these women, to explore the 
relationship between Frida Kahlo and Louise Nevelson, who were rivals 
and lovers.                               About the Actress:SHARON TALBOT, JEANE KIRKPATRICK, recently appeared in two films, “Contract Removals”, and “EVOL”.  Broadway: Don’t Drink the Water, Musical Jubilee; Off-Broadway: The Legend of Sharon Shashanovah, JB; “The Importance of Being Earnest”, The Housewives’ Cantata”.Regional:: Born

We are SofA Productions, a group of actors and directors all with one simple aim - to create beautiful theatre and unforgettable experiences. We believe that no matter what the context of the show, the audience should leave the theatre feeling more inspired and happier than when they arrived. This is especially true when it comes to children's theatre!



Since 2000 we have been creating theatre for children filled with detailed beauty and joy. We care deeply about our work and our responsibilities as artists and fully embrace the fact that what we are doing is essentially creating memories for life - and therefor make sure these memories are never less than breathtaking!

We design every step of the way from when the children enter the theatre to when they say goodbye to the characters so that we can create unforgettable experiences that leave the children with excitement and inspiration that stay with them for a long time.






 Why we need your help
We are a non-profit organisation and do this simply because giving children enjoyable and meaningful memories for life is simply one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling things you can do.
We have been doing very successful runs at our home in London for many years but we want to expand and give more children the chance to experience Once Upon a Time. The Brighton Fringe comes with enormous possibilities for us to develop and grow as a company - and for a lot more children to experience our magic - but it does however come with many additional costs for us.
Our total budget is £7000 to be able to take our whole production team and our shows to Brighton. The £3500 that we are asking for through indiegogo will simply go towards the cost of our team of 33 actors and directors being able to travel to and stay in Brighton. We are currently in negotiations with sponsors for our remaining production costs.
With your help we can affect so many more children than would otherwise be possible and we're eternally grateful for any help you can give us in achieving this cause! What we are asking for is the absolute minimum for us to be able to take our show to Brighton. Any excess we receive will firstly go towards renting a larger van to transport an even more extensive magical forest to the fringe, and the rest will be used to create more details in our props and costumes, making our sho even more magical!

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Project</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">""Cabaret"" is a word that some people hear and don't immediately understand: is it stand up comedy; is it musical theatre; is it jazz, is it a concert...WHAT is it? For me, the simple answer is: cabaret is the art of storytelling through songs. The long answer is: cabaret is a musical, comedic, interactive practice that encourages audiences to have their own emotional moments and connections articulated through music. It is intimate, interactive and fluid. It is funny, it is moving, and...depending upon audience and venue...it is an every changing performance.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Now, if that seems a bit mysterious to you, imagine the challenge of selling this fluid concept to theatres at home and abroad who aren't regular presenters of cabaret. Or, more specifically, of my version of cabaret. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is a very exciting project because it's going to produce a snapshot of my work - my version of cabaret - that I can use to sell my shows to theatres and booking agents across Canada and around the world. Staging a live show in Toronto this summer, we (me and my pal, 4x Canadian Screen Award winner, Mike Bickerton) are going to record the performances and shoot interviews to create a behind-the-scenes mini-documentary series that gives an inside look into a Sharron Matthews cabaret.</span></p>
<h3>WTF: What...the...funds (are going to)</h3> <p>Money makes the world go around...and also gets sh*t done in the production world. We need to spend some money to bring this idea to life, in some of the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>Venue costs for the live performance</li> <li>Camera equipment and operators - we're taking the production value up a notch from the old school camcorder</li>
<li>Audio equipment and operators - a girl's gotta sound good!</li> <li>Editing labour costs - to put together a series of videos that will highlight the live show experience</li> </ul> <p>I have been waiting for the last 5 years for a time when I would have the proper funds to support this project myself, a project that would be fully realized on every level. BUT EVERY buck I make goes right back into the business of touring cabaret, into administration and promotion, into new arrangements, buying new costumes, new websites, hiring production assistants to help me with all the many aspects of self-production. This is not a project that I want to skimp on...so, after a lot of soul searching, I decided to come to you.</p>
<p> Every dollar will go into creating a series of promotional videos that will bring the live experience of a Sharron Matthews show to people ALL AROUND THE WORLD. The reach of this series in the digital age means that my shows can be booked anywhere...you're truly investing in WORLD DOMINATION!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our goals are ambitious but quality costs money. </p> <ul> <li>The funding goal is $12,000 CDN </li> <li>To entice you to part with your dollars, we've thought up some creative perks; click the Perks link to find out how this game of ""show me the money"" is going to go down</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span><br/>
</h3> <p>For years I have been working with the same scratchy videos to demonstrate my work to new audiences, to presenters, to bookers and to festivals. These videos are wonderful snapshots of a moment in time BUT to reach bigger audiences, to be taken seriously in this High Def world, a polished video of my work will make ALL the difference.  Without being TOO dramatic, it is the difference between getting booked and NOT getting booked. <br/></p>
<p>This video project will help give me better access to the best arts trades shows and festivals around the world.  I may be 47, but this LADY STILL HAS GRAND DREAMS! After having many chats with Mike about it, we both agreed that we wanted to make it more than a performance video. We want to stir people to not only be excited about my work but also about cabaret and cabaret in Canada. We want to capture not only live performance but document rehearsal and what happens behind the scenes. It is not just a performance video...it will be an interesting look into my work and into Cabaret in Canada. It will also hopefully encourage other artists young and old(er) to consider this practice as a means of telling THEIR stories. <br/></p>
<p>I have funded and produced three world tours to London, New York, and Scotland, the first one years before the invention of crowdfunding engines like this. With Mike Bickerton, who has spent then last 15 years of his life producing live TV, our skill sets combined set us up for the BEST possible outcome. THE VERY BEST!! <br/></p>

McNenny conducting a Scene Study Workshop in New York City. Kathleen matched up
Paulina Cossio and Luisa Muhr to work on an excerpt from <i>Dolores</i> by Edward Allan Baker. Soon both actresses were so
passionate about the play that they kept wanting to explore the depth of this
one-act. </p>
<p>When the Workshop was over Kathleen, Paulina, and Luisa all
were certain that the play should be produced. With Kathleen’s encouragement
Paulina and Luisa finally decided to actually make their dream come true and
take initiative to start the production process. Kathleen was so supportive of
this decision that she offered herself as the director of the one-act. Starting

at least cover some of the costs. Looking ahead and calculating in what we have
already had to spend, our expenses come to around $5500 (breakdown in
percentages see budget diagram). This is mostly due to the expensive rehearsal
space rental in NYC (although we always rehearse at the cheapest rental studio
in town), but also to cover the rent of the theater and all other expenses. We
are hoping to fill the theater on all 4 performances, so are expecting to cover
more costs with the ticket sales, however that is not guaranteed. <br/></p><p>
So we really need your help to raise our next goals in order to make this

</p><p><b>$6500 and beyond</b></p>
<p>Hooray! Apart from guaranteeing the amazing production and

<br/><p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges, apart from this being our
first time producing anything ourselves, was finding an affordable venue in
NYC. We looked into several options but then came across The Playroom Theater
and it seemed perfect for our purposes. We wanted to make sure the venue was
fairly accessible, so that people would actually come. It is so important to us
to share this story with as many people as possible! <br/>
The other big challenge was finding an affordable rehearsal rental space. This
really has ended up costing us the most so far. Although we are rehearsing at
the cheapest studio rental space in town, costs are immense and hard to keep
low. </p>
<p>Another challenge was how to reduce the costs on finding a
set and props. We managed to get everything we need from bazaars and yard sales
in Upstate New York which helped us keeping costs low, however a lot is needed
for our set since it should portray a kitchen. Our amazing set designer Natalia
Vikhliaeva is helping us to realize this without having to spend thousands of
dollars. <br/>
Apart from our dialect coach Julia Lenardon (who also worked for an incredibly low price) our
entire production and creative team is volunteer-based. To actually find a
professional team that is willing to work for free or fully relying on our
crowd funding campaign is not easy – simply because there is no guarantee for anyone  involved to get
compensated. However, we are truly hoping to raise money so we can pay our
team, even if it is only a small amount. 
Everyone has been working really hard and it is very important to us to
compensate each person involved. </p>
<p>We have already put a lot of work into it but the very
specific and extremely difficult Rhode Island dialect has been a challenge. The
first challenge was to even make the decision to do the one-act in this dialect but we
wanted to be truthful to the play and do it justice, so decided we would take
on learning the dialect, even though it was coupled with a lot of extra costs
and much extra work. <br/>
Last but not least we had another problem with finding a space to build and
store our set. Luckily our set designer had some extra space in her apartment,
so the set will be assembled and built there for now. But we are still looking
into affordable studios or shared workshop spaces where we could paint and
build the set.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>How it works - Perks<br/></b></p><p>Pick a perk and go! It's all straight forward and easy, just follow the steps and you'll be done in a minute or less. All our perks are named after all-female-bands of the 60s, 70s, and 80s. We hope you'll enjoy picking one! And please share our campaign with your friends and family and anyone who could be interested!<br/></p><p>Don't want to pick a perk but still want to support us? – Great!

this production the most professional and everything it deserves to be! We are doing our very best to shine light on a topic that is not getting a lot of attention and we
could not do this without your help. From the bottom of our hearts: Thank you!</p>

 desperate for a safe haven. Sandra is forced to decide if her

Having survived a one-on-one cult, Marissa healed from Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) and Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES). She then set out to create an organization that addresses the gaps she saw preventing countless others from healing from abuse, the ramifications of which she found greatly impact society as a whole. Marissa is an actor, singer, voice over artist and model, in addition to being an advocate.

She is passionate about merging the arts and advocacy, using the arts as both a healing tool and a platform for positive change.


What you can expect...An adventurous evening of 
awareness! Not only will you get to see our production of Dolores but 
we also managed to organize a collaboration between our team and Marissa
 Ghavami, Founder and CEO of SHEARED
 (501(c)(3) Nonprofit Spreading 
Hope for the Exploited and Abused through Resources, Education and 
Discourse). SHEARED is a newly founded non-profit
organization dedicated to spreading hope of true healing to survivors of
 all
types of exploitation and abuse, reducing further instances of abuse and
decreasing the harmful misunderstanding of trauma and its widespread 
effects
among the public and professionals through resources, education and 
discourse. Marissa will hold a talk back after every performance of Dolores about
 her work as an advocate of raising awareness on abuse and how to get 
involved. More information about Marissa's organization can be found 
under: www.sheared.orgProducing Dolores - how it all came together...It all started with actress and acting teacher Kathleen
McNenny conducting a Scene Study Workshop in New York City. Kathleen matched up
Paulina Cossio and Luisa Muhr to work on an excerpt from Dolores by Edward Allan Baker. Soon both actresses were so
passionate about the play that they kept wanting to explore the depth of this
one-act. 
When the Workshop was over Kathleen, Paulina, and Luisa all
were certain that the play should be produced. With Kathleen’s encouragement
Paulina and Luisa finally decided to actually make their dream come true and
take initiative to start the production process. Kathleen was so supportive of
this decision that she offered herself as the director of the one-act. Starting
off as three ladies this production has since grown to an all-female team with
artists who are interested in female stories and bringing awareness to domestic
violence, a topic concerning all of us.We are also incredibly excited to make a collaboration with SHEARED happen 
Why all female?We are still in a time where women are less likely to get
hired than men and with Dolores we
created a platform where women with all different backgrounds, who are eager to
get involved in a project like this, are welcome to participate and share their
knowledge. Our production of Dolores, including the talk back on abuse, is a collaboration of women who create something together – something that they care about. FENGARI Ensemble
also strives to keep the team of Dolores
and its collaborators on board for upcoming productions and projects, guaranteeing female emerging
artists and professionals a platform where they can explore, live their
passion, and get involved in as many ways as they want.Why this story - why support us?
It is important to realize that the topic of domestic
violence concerns both, men and women. We must understand that this is not a
“female topic” – it is a human topic. 
We have to spread the awareness that one woman out of four
gets somehow abused – one out of four! Isn’t that crazy?! What's even more striking is that in the U.S. incidents of domestic violence against women occur every 15 seconds. And these numbers only reflect the cases that were reported, so imagine how many more cases
there actually are… Our first gut reaction was: How come we didn’t know
about this?! And: How come no one else seems to know about this?! We knew that
this needed to change…
When we heard this number we were shocked and knew that the
story of Dolores is not an uncommon
one. This is when we started realizing the actual importance of Dolores. We understood that this topic
was bigger and more important than we had ever imagined it to be and there was
no more hesitation: The story of Dolores
had to be re-told as a reminder of what is going on in the depths and shadows
of our society on a daily basis. As actors and theater makers we strive to do what we do best: tell stories. So, what we can do is use our art for a specific cause. We want to make a change by drawing awareness and contributing to the solving and healing of women's issues (that is our issues as a society).We are also excited to announce that we are now collaborating with the Kentucky-based organization SHEARED, founded and run by Marissa Ghavami. We would like to reach past our Flex Goal of $6500 to be able to raise money for SHEARED. Marissa is coming to New York and will hold talk backs about abuse and how to stop it after every performance of Dolores.
Our adventures, efforts, and highs so
far
We have already been working on this play for a while now
and keep exploring and finding new elements of it. 
Some of our favorite experiences and adventures so far: 
We managed to arrange a meeting with the playwright Edward
Allan Baker who was such an incredible source of knowledge and such great help
to us. Edward was one of the most open and kindest people we have met in a long
time. He didn’t shy away from telling us everything about his play, it’s back
story, and the lifestyle, history, and roles of the two characters he had
created. We are forever grateful to have his consent in producing his
incredible one-act.
While still working on Dolores during the Scene Study class we
managed to drive to a suburb in Rhode Island and record local people there in
order to be able to carefully study the dialect.Having Julia Lenardon, an acclaimed dialect and vocal coach,
on our team has always been a dream and the amount of help we have had from her
to really work the very difficult Rhode Island dialect cannot even be described
in words. We have had great sessions and keep striving forward with our dialect
work.  Another great thank you goes out to our dear friend Irwin Chusid, who provided us with a perfect song we can use in the play. The playwright specifically mentioned the song he wanted to be used in the play to resemble a Shirelles song but getting the rights for any band as famous as the Shirelles was impossible, so Irwin came to our rescue!Last but not least, our prop, set pieces, and costume hunt
brought us to Upstate New York and its many diverse little bazaars and yard
sales. We have had great finds so far, did a lot of bargaining, and have now
already started to build our set. We are excited to see the final product!The most recent accomplishment was getting Marissa Ghavami, founder of SHEARED, to come to New York to hold talk backs on abuse and what to do after our shows. Budget – How is the
money distributed and where does it go?Most of the money has to go into renting rehearsal spaces and the actual rental of the theater –  which both is incredibly expensive in NYC.Other big costs are definitely set and props, actually compensating our production and creative team, renting the lights and hire a light operator from the theater, printing costs and advertising, and the very important dialect coaching sessions to stay truthful to this amazing play and do it justice.Flex GoalsIt is really important that even when we have reached our
goal of $3500 we please need you to keep supporting us! This first goal does
NOT cover all our costs. We picked a lower goal, so that we can be assured to
at least cover some of the costs. Looking ahead and calculating in what we have

Apart from our dialect coach Julia Lenardon (who also worked for an incredibly low price) our
entire production and creative team is volunteer-based. To actually find a
professional team that is willing to work for free or fully relying on our
crowd funding campaign is not easy – simply because there is no guarantee for anyone  involved to get
compensated. However, we are truly hoping to raise money so we can pay our
team, even if it is only a small amount. 
Everyone has been working really hard and it is very important to us to
compensate each person involved. 
We have already put a lot of work into it but the very
specific and extremely difficult Rhode Island dialect has been a challenge. The
first challenge was to even make the decision to do the one-act in this dialect but we
wanted to be truthful to the play and do it justice, so decided we would take
on learning the dialect, even though it was coupled with a lot of extra costs
and much extra work. 
Last but not least we had another problem with finding a space to build and
store our set. Luckily our set designer had some extra space in her apartment,
so the set will be assembled and built there for now. But we are still looking
into affordable studios or shared workshop spaces where we could paint and
build the set.

We need to talk about it using the only way we know that successfully creates change - by telling the story. And with first hand experience living on one of the estates being 'regenerated' in Brixton, this story offers a unique glimpse into reality. 








#ReGeneration explores the system of ‘gentrification’ through the lens of the increasingly segregated Brixton. It

   What We Need.. 
We've dusted ourselves off, given ourselves a talking to and come up with a plan - we've stripped the project right back to the bare bones, every penny you contribute will be going towards paying actors to do the reading for the festival.
We'll do everything else. Unpaid. We urgently need to tell this story, it's everyone's story and getting it out there and heard is most important to us. 
We have a script (via our writer - Endy McKay), rehearsal space (with support in kind from Oval House Theatre), a performance space (Camden People's Theatre) and all the bits in between but to really move people we need tip top actor's to tell the story and help us to create that change.
We need 6 actors 
We will pay them £70 per day.
2x day rehearsal (£840)
1x day Tech run & performance (£420)
£1260 total - Every penny we are asking for is to pay them for their contribution.

Risks & Challenges Bring it on! We know this is going to be challenging, we are both actresses (we being Chetna Pandya & Endy McKay), co founders & directors of Outspoken Arts & both mothers too but what's the point of looking back at your life and wondering how your contribution might have changed something. Why not be the change. So we are going to be drinking caffeine by the bucket load and getting it done. Risks & Challenges - none that we aren't ready to conquer! 
We have a strong community of creatives around us and our mobiles are armed at the ready to pull in some favours too :)

Check out our testimonials from R&D stage 1“I think it would make a great theatre piece and a great site-specific piece. I definitely started imagining it taking place in really exciting, just-about-to-be-gentrified spaces, but I think a theatre version could work well too. I thought the writing and the performances were just great - really strong and really exciting.” Poppy Keeling, Complicite “WELL DONE!!! Its a really exciting and important project.” Amy Clamp, Pleasance Theatre “Loved it! Thought the actors were terrific and it demonstrated a huge amount of work for a week.” Catherine Alexander, CSSD“I always end a day's work berating myself for talking too much! But then the next day, do exactly the same thing again, because I felt so passionate about the work you'd made. Well done and thank you. It was a really affirming experience being asked to contribute and think. Wow, being encouraged to think while working with women who inspire you, Win bloody WIN!! What a fabulous week that was. Very inspiring watching you and Endy making it happen. And I really appreciated being in the room. Bodes really well for the production that you galvanised all of us during the week. We'll all be there at the next occupation!” Ayesha Antoine – Actor",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The Canary's Silence campaign has been extended! </h2>
<h3><strong>We behind the Canary’s Silence are committed to exploring experiences that audiences have never seen or heard before and we are determined to get as many people in the seats as possible. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Therefore, we are extending our indiegogo.com crowdfunding campaign with an added <u>special perk</u>, nearly equivalent to the price of a ticket, allowing us to “pre-sell tickets” <i>and raise the funds for insurance, rentals, in-house technicians, local marketing, transportation, and gas.  </i></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Of course, we are greatly appreciative to larger donors, which are such a huge benefit to this show and to this young artist’s future, which is so very bright.  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The Canary’s Silence is a performance work, three years into its making and a true collaborative process between deciplines and a host of creative individuals. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The seed for the show was planted as an idea for an independent study by Jack Kavanagh under the supervision of Cirque Du Soleil choreographer Michael Montanaro. That idea grew into what we hope will dazzle audiences in Vermont and New Haven this summer!  But we need your help! ECA shows are back to back, August 19th and 20th at Educational Center for the Arts 55 Audubon St. The Shows start at 8PM.  Children are welcome but be advised the show is performed in the dark. </strong></h3>

Who are we?  We are a group of local actors who have formed the new, not-for-profit Haberdashery Theatre Company in Vancouver, BC. Our founding members (in alphabetical order) are John Cassini, Stephen Lobo, Jenn MacLean Angus, Brian Markinson, Lori Triolo and Kyra Zagorsky. We plan for this company to evolve over time to include new members: actors, directors, producers and writers who share our vision.    The First Show We are thrilled to announce that the Firehall Arts Centre is presenting our inaugural production, the Vancouver premiere of The Motherf**ker with the Hat, written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis. This award-winning play is a powerful piece of writing that deals with addiction, recovery, betrayal and loyalty.

Our Goal Launching with The Motherf**ker with the Hat, we endeavour to produce contemporary and socially relevant plays, adding our voice to the Vancouver theatre scene by bringing independent productions - usually seen in smaller black box theatre - to larger audiences. 
How do we do that? 


By bringing the highest possible production value we can offer to our audience in regards to set design, lighting, music, cast, etc. 

By using social media to engage and invite more people to become theatre goers. 

Our ultimate goal is to get bums in seats for this play and the next. And the next after that. Audience attendance enriches our local art scene and the culture of our community.


    
Why are we doing this?

 Because Theatre Matters.
We deeply believe there is no other experience like going to the theatre. Audiences hear the words of great playwrights and, most importantly, play an essential part by bearing witness to these stories. It is an event that is recorded only in memory and that is firmly rooted in the here and now.

<p>In
the context of the Greek crisis we practise 'urban farming’. We dig into the

<p><b>In October 2015 we created a
site-specific performance on the streets of Dourgouti, an area of Athens with a
rich history of immigration, refugees and resistance. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our
team spent 18 months in Dourgouti researching and gathering information from
residents and archives about the area that was once full of makeshift refugee
huts. Huts, which had no foundation....</p>
<p>Armed
with the stories of the neighbourhood, 40 performers (from both Greece and
abroad) invited by the theatre group «Ohi Pezoume» climbed onto roofs and
terraces, entered courtyards, crammed into corners and opened the doors of
derelict shops. We made the spaces of Dourgouti our own, at least for a little
while. We turned 25 of these spaces into the sites of our performance. We took
our audience on small journeys between these points where they watched and
interacted with the performers. </p>

<p><b>Our Aim</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our
aim is to put on a new performance in Dourgouti, which will run throughout
September 2016. The performance will include new actions, live art and the
further exploration of the different spaces of the neighbourhood. We hope to
enrich our performance and the neighbourhood by including more points of
interaction, more collaborators and continuing to meet and work with local residents.

<b></b><p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>You have watched the 200th episode and hummed along a thousand times, lamenting the fact that there wasn’t more of it and imagining you could watch a full production with all-new, all-original, all-Supernatural songs. Well… It's here -  the parody musical theatre event all Supernatural fans have been waiting for! Come see John and Mary be terrible parents! Come see Sam attempt to be “Totally Normal”! Come see Dean eat pie and fall in love with the Impala! Come see Cas not get any references! Come see Azazel sing about his plans in a jazz number! All original songs, dance numbers and plot twists you will never suspect (although no alien robots in the second act)!</p>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Coven Cat Productions is a brand new amateur theatre company, based in Edinburgh. It is the bigger, better and more international heir of our director’s first company which started operating 13 years ago in a small Eastern European country and has put on more than ten original musicals, promoting fresh ideas and winning awards at local festivals. We are big fans of the USA-based StarKid and we’re aiming at delivering the same level of music, comedy and heartfelt messages. Coven Cat Productions has brought together theatre enthusiasts from the UK and the rest of Europe, as well as the USA, many of them with years of experience on and behind the stage. Supernatural: The Parody Musical will be our very first production as a team and we are aiming high!

<p>Supernatural: The Parody Musical was created by, and stars,
fans of the show. Our goal is to bring the key themes of the show – friendship,
brotherhood, loyalty (and of course, cute actors) – into a new form. If you
love the show, our musical will not disappoint. It’s funny, dramatic and
touching in equal measure, and our actors aim to bring new life to their
characters while also staying true to the core of their personalities in the TV
show. We hope you’re as excited about this as we are, and give us a chance to show
you just how brilliant a Supernatural musical can be by supporting us in any
way you can. </p>

</div>","The Story
You have watched the 200th episode and hummed along a thousand times, lamenting the fact that there wasn’t more of it and imagining you could watch a full production with all-new, all-original, all-Supernatural songs. Well… It's here -  the parody musical theatre event all Supernatural fans have been waiting for! Come see John and Mary be terrible parents! Come see Sam attempt to be “Totally Normal”! Come see Dean eat pie and fall in love with the Impala! Come see Cas not get any references! Come see Azazel sing about his plans in a jazz number! All original songs, dance numbers and plot twists you will never suspect (although no alien robots in the second act)!
Get to know us better by watching the bloopers below!

About us
Coven Cat Productions is a brand new amateur theatre company, based in Edinburgh. It is the bigger, better and more international heir of our director’s first company which started operating 13 years ago in a small Eastern European country and has put on more than ten original musicals, promoting fresh ideas and winning awards at local festivals. We are big fans of the USA-based StarKid and we’re aiming at delivering the same level of music, comedy and heartfelt messages. Coven Cat Productions has brought together theatre enthusiasts from the UK and the rest of Europe, as well as the USA, many of them with years of experience on and behind the stage.

</p>
<p>Hiya! My name is Shelly Hudson. I am the mom of an amazing
14yr daughter and a rockin’ dog named Trouble.  I am a creative entrepreneur with over 20 yrs
of experience in arts &amp; nonprofit management. I am also a graduate of
Stevens High class of 94.  Go Cardinals! </p>
<p>The arts have been a huge part of my life for as long as I
can remember. From taking the stage for the first time at the age of 5 to high
school and community theatre and dance. Sadly, like many teens who grew up in the
Sullivan County area, the arts experiences were limited and still are today. So I filled the void through
involvement in a local nonprofit teen dance club, a hip hop dance team (yep
that’s right a hip hop dance team in the 90’s… before it was cool) and
community theatre. Yeah… I dig the arts. </p>
<p>Now skip ahead a few years, after going away to college
where I majored in theatre at Dean College, I came home eager to share what I
had learned. Not too much to my surprise there were still very few options for an
outlet and even less willingness from the few local arts groups to bring in an
“outsider”. Claremont, the only city in Sullivan County is one of the highest aging communities in the state. Young people are leaving in droves and lack of access to high quality, innovative arts and culture. </p>
<p>That is when Amplified Arts really began…. A thought...an
idea.. ""What would a space, where artist collaborated, supported and inspired
each other to amplify their art, be like?""  A creative hub that included arts
education opportunities and an intimate performance space.  At that point in time I had no idea how to
make it happen. I just knew I wanted to explore and see where this concept
would lead. Lucky for me, this vision led to start of my own nonprofit
performing arts studio in Sullivan County where I worked with youth 5 – 21 for
11 successful years producing award winning theatre and film. It also led me
to take on the role of executive director of our local Chamber of
Commerce where I grew and developed the organization for 5 ½ years. and then informed my decision to move out of the area to an indie cinema in the state’s capital where
for the past 4 ½ year I have developed skills in fundraising, programming development,
staff &amp; budget management. </p>
<p>I am now ready to bring Amplified Arts to fruition! I am
ready to bring this exciting opportunity to my home town!</p>
<p><b> So what is Amplified Arts?</b>  Amplified Arts is an arts education and
performance hub located in downtown Claremont NH, where artists of all genres
create and inspire each other and the greater community through theatre, music,
art and film… all under one roof!</p>
<p><b>Our</b> <b>learning space</b> offers opportunities to
learn new skills and find new talents. We will offer classes to support the art
we are producing i.e. film editing, voice lessons or directing to name a few as
well as host after school arts programming and E (Extended)L(Learning)O(opportunity)
for K – College. We will also offer space for private music lessons and jam
sessions.</p>
<p><b>Our</b> <b>performance venue</b> offers locally and
regionally produced live music and theatre. We will produce a season of in
house semi-professional productions as well as showcase local directors and
theatre companies. We will have live music to sharpen the senses that run the
spectrum of style and taste.</p>
<p><b>Our</b> <b>art gallery</b> is a location for artists
and art lovers in Sullivan County. We will showcase a different artist each
month during which time they will also teach art workshops and talk backs.</p>
<p><b>Our</b> <b>art house cinema</b> screens film from
around the world and across the street. We showcase indie films as well as
local projects, cult classics and signature movie events.</p>
<p><b>What are we up to…</b>
Currently we are in phase one of our organizational build out. This includes
branding work like our logo and website, producing programming like our first
Downtown Movie Night and our upcoming production of The Importance of Being
Earnest produced by our early career (13-18yrs) arts program called The Academy. </p>
<p><b>That is where you
come in</b>… We are looking to raise $10,000 to help cover this first phase. The funds will help with the cost of the branding work (our logo) and the needs for
the upcoming production (rental, event insurance, printing etc.) Any additional
funds raises will go to support phase two: business build out ( Secure our
home, set up funds to hire our Producing Artistic Director and produce our

<p>

<p></p>
<p>“The
Little Black Fish” is one of the most celebrated contemporary children's
stories in Iran.  We are producing it for the stage in the United States
for the first time because we believe in the power of stories and the
importance of producing great art for children. “The Little Black Fish” is
a story that has inspired generations of Iranians to dream big and explore new
horizons.  Mohammad Aghebati was commissioned by the Crescent Moon Project
to produce the play for the celebration of Iranian New Year and we had two
successful tryouts in NYC.  There was a lot of interest and children loved
the show. We want to bring it to a wider audience by doing a full
production, with a magical design that matches the wonders of the story. </p>
<p>Samad
Behrangi's short story is about a fish that lives in a small stream and wants
to live a life with aspirations and purpose.  He embarks on an eye-opening
journey with the spirit of a dreamer experiencing an awakening, but in the
process he does more than that. The path leads him to wisdom, courage,
awareness and study of complex social relations. The story of “The Little Black
Fish” is a revelation<span>, not just an experience. It is about
stepping outside the confines of a self-centered life, and about drawing a distinction
between the wandering and the stationary. It has a pedagogic value with
numerous underlying political messages and shows a path to freedom, equality
and justice, with a simple analogy for younger readers to understand. </span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary





“The
Little Black Fish” is one of the most celebrated contemporary children's
stories in Iran.  We are producing it for the stage in the United States
for the first time because we believe in the power of stories and the
importance of producing great art for children. “The Little Black Fish” is
a story that has inspired generations of Iranians to dream big and explore new
horizons.  Mohammad Aghebati was commissioned by the Crescent Moon Project
to produce the play for the celebration of Iranian New Year and we had two
successful tryouts in NYC.  There was a lot of interest and children loved
the show. We want to bring it to a wider audience by doing a full
production, with a magical design that matches the wonders of the story. 
Samad
Behrangi's short story is about a fish that lives in a small stream and wants
to live a life with aspirations and purpose.  He embarks on an eye-opening
journey with the spirit of a dreamer experiencing an awakening, but in the
process he does more than that. The path leads him to wisdom, courage,
awareness and study of complex social relations. The story of “The Little Black
Fish” is a revelation, not just an experience. It is about
stepping outside the confines of a self-centered life, and about drawing a distinction
between the wandering and the stationary. It has a pedagogic value with
numerous underlying political messages and shows a path to freedom, equality
and justice, with a simple analogy for younger readers to understand.

 We are
fundraising to:


Complete the design (set, costume, video, light, sound, music) to create

     the show for those unable to attend

Our
auction is held on our website and is supported by 17 artists who have donated
their work for this project.Many of the art works were specifically
created with the theme of ""The Little Black Fish"". After our NYC premiere,

artists and resources we need to create the best possible production for YOU. A
production that strives for excellence and reaches the high standards you
deserve as our audience and collaborators. Yes, you are our collaborators, for
without YOU, our curious and worldly-wise audience of theatergoers and
supporters, our work on this stunning and timely play could go unsung. Helen
Edmundson has said of her work: “I wouldn’t want someone to leave and not feel
they’ve been made to think about the world they are living in.”  What a
time it is to do just that!  We invite you to donate now and help start
the conversation and ask the questions. Thank you.

<p><strong>From Dom:</strong> <i>""I was diagnosed with Stage 2 Bowel cancer back in February 2014.

Due to them finding this they were unable to complete the operation.<br/><br/>Once I was healed from the failed operation I was put on a new more intensive Chemotherapy of Folfiri regime, this seemed to be working and shrinking the tumour. Since March when the treatment cycle finished I have been off all treatment and the Stage 4 Secondary Bowel Cancer has now spread to my bones in my pelvis and also near the coccyx.  The treatment offered in the UK is pointless as i will die either way. So my only option is to come to Germany to have advanced immunotherapy that can save my life.""</i><br/><br/>Dom has now started treatment at the Hallwang Clinic in Germany and it is all looking very promising, each day there is great news coming from patients that are also having targeted lifesaving cancer treatments there and gives everyone a great boost and there is a great atmosphere here amongst all staff and patients.<br/><br/>We want you to help us to help Dom continue his treatment in Germany.</p>
<p>Simon met Dom back in 2008 , his first season as a Stage Hypnotist, they worked together for many years in Greece and have stayed friends for years.</p>
<p>Simon was gutted to hear about Dom’s cancer as he had always been a fit and sporty bloke and promised to do something to raise funds for Dom’s treatment in Germany.</p>
<p>And this is it.</p>

<p>That's the deal. You help us get there. Once we get there - all of our profits from our ticket sales go directly to helping Dominic's campaign. </p>
<p>And we've already started to sell tickets - (as well as hypnosis being very popular in Australia, we've always been popular before and sold out shows many times...) So this this could potentially add up to a lot for Dominic's treatment.<br/><br/>(And we will of course keep you updated on this as we go). </p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Anthony J. Piccione. I am a playwright originally from Connecticut and currently living in New York City. Last year in May, I received my BA in Theatre, with minors in Writing and Film Studies, from Eastern Connecticut State University. My many loves and passions include scriptwriting, theatre, film, poetry, music, blogging, volunteerism, politics, history, painting, cooking and more. I also have dealt with episodes of depression, social anxiety, and a high functioning form of autism called Asperger’s syndrome during my life. However, I’ve tried my best to overcome each of these things to ensure that I’m still able to do the things in life that I love, and hopefully break a few stereotypes that are still surrounding all people with ASD along the way.</p>
<p>I have already been lucky enough to have had some success in NYC. My one-act play <i>The End of the Line at the End </i>received its world premiere at Manhattan Repertory Theatre in October 2016, and my one-act play <i>Two Cousins and a Pizza </i>is scheduled to premiere at the Hudson Guild Theatre - as part of the Winterfest Theatre Festival - in February 2017. Before that, I had many other short plays produced at my college and at other Connecticut venues. I am hoping that the rest of 2017 and beyond will bring me even more success, and that I will be able to build on what I've already begun with my career as a playwright.</p>
<p>To learn more about me, you can visit my personal blog: <a href=""http://www.anthonyjpiccione.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.anthonyjpiccione.tumblr.com</a></p>
<h3>About The Play</h3>
<p><i>An Energy Tale </i>is a one-act children's play that aims to educate youth on the potential impact of climate change, in a way that is both fun and informative.</p>
<p>The play takes place in the year 2184, when the world is far different than it is in our time. While a young boy named Jimmy is sitting around and juggling rocks - the only mildly fun hobby left to do on Earth - he is encountered by a mysterious man known as Dr. Science. With Jimmy and Dr. Science, the audience is transported back to the past - to our present - to learn about how many important decisions being made today, from fuel sources to politics, have affected Jimmy's world...our future.</p>
<p>The play was written during my last semester of college for an assignment in my Scriptwriting class. That same semester, it became a finalist in the 2016 CT ""Wright the World"" playwriting contest, and ultimately finished in 2nd place.</p>
<h3>The Goal Of This Campaign</h3>
<p>This year, I am hoping to have the chance to finally bring this play to life as a full-production during the summer. I am excited to have the opportunity to potentially bring this play to Midtown International Theatre Festival - one of the most popular Off-Off-Broadway theatre festivals in New York City - this July and August. However, Midtown International Theatre Festival requests that playwrights put forward a minimum amount of funds upfront in order to be accepted, as part of their Profit Sharing Policy. Therefore, I have decided to start this campaign to help secure the minimum funds needed to be able to persue this opportunity.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Impact</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise at least $337. That is the bare minimum amount that is needed to be paid, in order to participate in the festival. We will also be in need of additional funds raised beyond that will be used toward funding extra aspects of the production such as additional rehearsal space, costuming and set pieces, publicity materials, etc.</p>
<p>Remember that every dollar raised will help make a difference in achieving this goal, so even a small amount would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>Aside from anything to do with me, I believe that this play carries a message that deserves to be heard not just by kids, but by everyone who cares about the future of our world. I know some might question whether or not kids should be treated to an educational play that tackles a serious issue such as this, but I believe if ANYONE at all has the right to know about these issues, it's kids. They are the ones who will ultimately be affected by this issue in the long-term, and I believe that they need to be taught about these issues and the potential consequences so that they can know how to deal with them.</p>
<p>If you agree with me, that's just more of a reason for me to encourage you to chip in!  By donating to this project, you'll be increasingly the likelihood that this show has a chance to be produced in a fantastic venue, and in a festival that is well-attended each year, thus increasing the odds that more people will have the chance to see the message in the play that I speak of. The only way that can happen, though, is if we get the funds necessary.</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>To those reading this, what I can promise is this: When I start a big project like this, I never give up on it, and I'm always determined to see it through. I think anyone who's followed me and my artistic endeavors over the past few years knows that much about me. That is especially the case for this project, which is one of my personal favorite plays that I've written today, in large part because of the message that it carries. If you donate to this project, I can assure you that I will do everything that I can to make sure that this play is produced, and any funds I receive here will go toward making that a reality.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Beyond donating, there are other ways that you can help fund this project. After reading this, I hope you can share this to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Indiegogo includes several of its own features that make sharing with others easy, so be sure to check those out!</p>
<p>Also, once the play does finally make its world premiere, I hope you'll be able to join us for the show in NYC! I promise you that when it happens, it will be one to remember!</p>
<p>I hope you will please donate to this project, and that you will share it with as many of your friends, family, acquaintances, etc. as you possibly can! Thank you for your interest, and I can't wait to have the chance to start work on this play! :)</p>

The play takes place in the year 2184, when the world is far different than it is in our time. While a young boy named Jimmy is sitting around and juggling rocks - the only mildly fun hobby left to do on Earth - he is encountered by a mysterious man known as Dr. Science. With Jimmy and Dr. Science, the audience is transported back to the past - to our present - to learn about how many important decisions being made today, from fuel sources to politics, have affected Jimmy's world...our future.
The play was written during my last semester of college for an assignment in my Scriptwriting class. That same semester, it became a finalist in the 2016 CT ""Wright the World"" playwriting contest, and ultimately finished in 2nd place.
The Goal Of This Campaign
This year, I am hoping to have the chance to finally bring this play to life as a full-production during the summer. I am excited to have the opportunity to potentially bring this play to Midtown International Theatre Festival - one of the most popular Off-Off-Broadway theatre festivals in New York City - this July and August. However, Midtown International Theatre Festival requests that playwrights put forward a minimum amount of funds upfront in order to be accepted, as part of their Profit Sharing Policy. Therefore, I have decided to start this campaign to help secure the minimum funds needed to be able to persue this opportunity.
What We Need & Impact
The goal of this campaign is to raise at least $337. That is the bare minimum amount that is needed to be paid, in order to participate in the festival. We will also be in need of additional funds raised beyond that will be used toward funding extra aspects of the production such as additional rehearsal space, costuming and set pieces, publicity materials, etc.
Remember that every dollar raised will help make a difference in achieving this goal, so even a small amount would be much appreciated!
Aside from anything to do with me, I believe that this play carries a message that deserves to be heard not just by kids, but by everyone who cares about the future of our world. I know some might question whether or not kids should be treated to an educational play that tackles a serious issue such as this, but I believe if ANYONE at all has the right to know about these issues, it's kids. They are the ones who will ultimately be affected by this issue in the long-term, and I believe that they need to be taught about these issues and the potential consequences so that they can know how to deal with them.
If you agree with me, that's just more of a reason for me to encourage you to chip in!  By donating to this project, you'll be increasingly the likelihood that this show has a chance to be produced in a fantastic venue, and in a festival that is well-attended each year, thus increasing the odds that more people will have the chance to see the message in the play that I speak of. The only way that can happen, though, is if we get the funds necessary.
Risks and Challenges
To those reading this, what I can promise is this: When I start a big project like this, I never give up on it, and I'm always determined to see it through. I think anyone who's followed me and my artistic endeavors over the past few years knows that much about me. That is especially the case for this project, which is one of my personal favorite plays that I've written today, in large part because of the message that it carries. If you donate to this project, I can assure you that I will do everything that I can to make sure that this play is produced, and any funds I receive here will go toward making that a reality.
Other Ways You Can Help
Beyond donating, there are other ways that you can help fund this project. After reading this, I hope you can share this to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Indiegogo includes several of its own features that make sharing with others easy, so be sure to check those out!
Also, once the play does finally make its world premiere, I hope you'll be able to join us for the show in NYC! I promise you that when it happens, it will be one to remember!
I hope you will please donate to this project, and that you will share it with as many of your friends, family, acquaintances, etc. as you possibly can! Thank you for your interest, and I can't wait to have the chance to start work on this play! :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>The Road Theatre Company was founded in 1991 by a group of dedicated artists who were passionate about bringing new, socially relevant voices and challenging ideas to the American stage. Since then, we have become one of only a handful of companies in Los Angeles that produce new works. Why so few? Because producing new plays is a huge risk. Live theatre can be prohibitively expensive to produce, and producing a show no one has ever heard of presents challenges many theatre producers are reluctant to face.</p>
<p>The Road Theatre has been taking on those challenges for 25 years.

</div></div>","Who We Are
The Road Theatre Company was founded in 1991 by a group of dedicated artists who were passionate about bringing new, socially relevant voices and challenging ideas to the American stage. Since then, we have become one of only a handful of companies in Los Angeles that produce new works. Why so few? Because producing new plays is a huge risk. Live theatre can be prohibitively expensive to produce, and producing a show no one has ever heard of presents challenges many theatre producers are reluctant to face.
The Road Theatre has been taking on those challenges for 25 years. We believe that it is essential for the health of the American ethos to advance the larger theatrical conversation of our national culture. Through this dialogue we animate and inspire both our artists and audiences with the realization that through art and action we are lifted into the searching of soul, the revelation of humanity, the awareness that we are not alone and the struggle to make sense of our existence on this earth – as it is and as we wish it to be.

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>JED Productions wants to make fringe theatre <i>really</i> accessible and sustainable for everyone, including the people on the stage <i>and </i>those<i> </i>watching it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people know me as 'Jezza' and i've been aspiring to be a Fairy Godmother of Pantomime since 2004.  It was my first job as an actor, <i>and </i>one of my first professional writing jobs.  My shows have been seen by around 77,000 audience members between 2010 and 2015.</li>
<li>The call of the Bow Bells (or something similar) told me to produce my own pantomimes with the support of extremely talented people since 2013 at the Bridewell Theatre in London.  We want to continue making it fun, fresh and good place for people to come.  Many people's first experience of live theatre is Pantomime, but then we lost them to extortionate ticket prices.  I'd love to get them back and show them what fun live theatre still is.</li>
<li>If you can be the Dormice-turned-Footmen to my Cinderella, you are sticking up two fingers to non-sensical elitism and making theatre sustainable for the people who work in it (a rare thing these days) <i>and </i>making sure many people who don't always get to see theatre <i>can</i> see it.  We get a lot of people in who are Pensioners or have low income.  They come with a weak smile on their faces, and leave with a deep belly laugh.  You can help make their life better, if only for an hour.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Here's what your amazing contributions can make happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short of finding Jack's Magic Beans, we're using this platform to raise £2000.  We're appealing to you, everyday philanthropists, to make this happen.  At this point, we think it <i>realistic</i> to cover our main costs so that every penny we make at the Box Office can be split (profit share style) between the Cast and Technician, the very people who make the show what it truly is.  If we raise a Grand, they'll be walking away with approximately £350 each, unheard of in most profit share shows.</li>
<li>If Dick Whittington is right and the streets of Indiegogo really ARE paved with gold and we get the full £2k, this will go to the Cast and Technician too, in order to reimburse them better for the wonderful work that they do (travel costs etc).</li>
<li>Cinderella went from Rags to Riches, so we thought of something special for you, too.  For our perks we are offering a little slice of Pantomime history.  As far as we know we are the ONLY Lunchtime Pantomime in existence, so signed flyers, programmes posters and props can wing their way to you, or if you come to see the show, you can get them in person!  </li>
<li>If the results are more Baron Hardup than Aladdin's Magic Lamp, we'll use the money to cover costs as much as is possible to free up as much of the Profit Pot there is for this years Babes in the Wood (a good analogy for creative people if ever I heard one!)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're not going to change the world but we're going to make it a lot more fun!</p>
<ul>
<li>Like a scullery maid in a dingy cellar, we all need to escape our daily lives for a while.  Sitting in a warm, comfortable local theatre for 45 minutes is a very good way of doing that.  The world is an uncertain place, but the comedy joy found at the Bridewell Lunchtime Pantomime can be relied upon!  It makes a difference to everyday people, just like you.</li>
<li>For the last three years we've pulled in around 650 people each year, an average of 54 people per show, which is a very respectable number for a fringe audience.  Some people come multiple times, each time bringing friends or just enjoying to for themselves (I think the record was one chap who came 5 times, he really <i>did </i>want to go to the ball!)</li>
<li>Most of you have never met me before and I wouldn't blame you for thinking a small theatre in the backstreets of London probably <i>isn't</i> paved with comedy gold...but we think it is.  The writing of the show is often commented upon, just check out the audience review videos in the video gallery below our main campaign video. Our gorgeous audience love the fact that there's a laugh in almost every line.  I've been devouring comedy since I was born, and every year I get to mix it up and share it with new people who laugh so hard they miss the next joke.  Please help me keep them laughing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk, as ever, is that the show gets more 'Boos' than Cheers and no one bothers coming, but that would be very unlikely given our successful track record!</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Daisy the Cow, I can be a stubborn heifer.  If it's raining I still spend many an hour flyering for the show, as do my amazing cast members.  I've worked on the script all year so you can be sure it will have the trademark graft and effort that all my previous work has had too.</li>
<li>If no one turns up, I shall wave the magic wand called <i>humility</i> and find out why.  Audiences have a great way of telling you they're not happy, and if they're not, re-writing is swift and effective.  But in the three years i've been doing pantomime at the Bridewell, and the four I wrote before that for schools (seen by around 25,000 people a year they were) I've never had an audience totally 'turn off'.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know some of you lovely people don't have a Magic Genie and just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help if you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you make like a Giant and create a lot of noise for me about this campaign?</li>
<li>If you feel able, share this link around your social media networks and feel a golden Rapunzel-like glow around your head for such a good deed.</li>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Angie Moon Dance Theatre was established in 2011 in Boston, MA. Since the birth of the company we have presented work at the Kennedy Center, Danspace, Dixon Place, The Manhattan JCC, Roger Williams University, University Settlement, Actors Fund Arts Center, Farmers Markets, Art Galleries, Abandoned Pubs in London, and many more! After a brief hiatus to earn my MFA at NYU/Tisch we are back in action, presenting work in NYC, and about to premiere “Hunting Year”, a new 45 min collaborative work that has been a year in a making. The shows are December 15th &amp; 16th, at Triskelion Arts as a part of their Split Bill Series. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This campaign is mainly to compensate my dancers for their unbelievable work throughout this  endeavor. My process is extremely collaborative, so I not only ask them to come and dance, but I also rely on their creative input as well. “Hunting Year” would not be what it is without them. I thank the universe constantly for their commitment to me, and my work. It is painful to me that I have not yet been able to compensate them. Up until this point I have always paid my dancers out of my own pocket, however what I can offer is not acceptable for the amount of time we have been rehearsing with a cast of 8 dancers. I hope to spend around $5,000 on compensating them. The rest of the money I have left over will be going towards breaking even on the rehearsal space I have rented out of pocket for the year (about $2,000 total) and lastly, the future of the company. We are starting to gain some steam and present work more regularly, and I am at the point where I want AMDT to run as a legitimate business. I not only want to continue to present my own work, but I also have some long term goals that will help keep my company running, AND hugely benefit the dance community, (explained below.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>(2-4 year plan)- </strong><i>Creative workshop for pre-professionals.</i> As a multi media artist myself, I see the benefit of exploring many mediums of art. They all filter into my understanding of creativity, form, and composition as a whole. For this reason I wish to create a series of workshops or intensives for young makers who are interested in collaborating and learning about other mediums. There are countless dance workshops for dancers who want to work on their technique, but less for the dancers who want to seriously explore who they are as artists. I plan to make one that includes all different forms of art, where collaboration is encouraged, mentorship is offered, and projects are created. This will be application and portfolio based. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>(5-7 year plan)-</strong> <i>Multi-media performance opportunities for early/mid career artists.</i> As, I mentioned above, I am a huge believer in collaboration. This concert series will focus on getting a collective of early and mid career artists, (spanning many genres) together to go wild! In this series my goal is to select a collective of artists based on applications and portfolios, give them a space to work in, a stipend to split how they would like to, mentorship, and the time/resources to create a multi-media collaborative evening of art! These opportunities are also incredibly rare to come by, (if at all) and would not only encourage artists to collaborate and work together, but will also give them experience in handling a budget, and producing a show. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Of course, these are HEFTY goals, and and there will be many many steps in between now and when they become active events. However I strongly believe in the potential of these events, and the positive impact they can have on the community. I believe they are ideas that can eventually travel, not only nationally but internationally. Seeing them as being far off in the distance is difficult, but I know to do it right (and to give them longevity) the foundation will need to be strong, which means lots of grant applications, fundraising, and a fabulous team of leaders to get the logistics ironed out. The leftover money will not be all we need to get these plans done, however it will be a starting point that will grant me the time and space to get the first steps in place. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact of this campaign, if successful will be more than what I think most people even realize. The dance world is full of opportunities for dancers, yet the vast majority of them are unpaid and if they are, it is often much less than minimum wage. I think sometimes it is easy to forget that these artists are dancers for a living, not as a hobby. They are committed to this lifestyle, it is grueling, it is expensive, it is time consuming, it is exhausting, and it is often unappreciated. It is not a hobby, it is their career. A little goes a long way, and if you break it down- What I hope to give them is still just under minimum wage, which is devastating. The impact of my plans stated above could potentially be career changing, not just for me, but for every artist who can participate. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The arts are always risky to an extent. However I have a track record of being successful in what I set my mind to. I have successfully produced conferences, shows, workshops, and events. I have been a teacher for 15 years where I am lucky to travel the country spreading art to kids, and what makes me most proud is that in most of my career I have created my own opportunities. I decided at a young age that I wanted a career in dance, and I am thankful for my wild ambition and stubborn personality for making it happen! </p>

They are committed to this lifestyle, it is grueling, it is expensive, it is time consuming, it is exhausting, and it is often unappreciated. It is not a hobby, it is their career. A little goes a long way, and if you break it down- What I hope to give them is still just under minimum wage, which is devastating. The impact of my plans stated above could potentially be career changing, not just for me, but for every artist who can participate. 
 
The arts are always risky to an extent. However I have a track record of being successful in what I set my mind to. I have successfully produced conferences, shows, workshops, and events. I have been a teacher for 15 years where I am lucky to travel the country spreading art to kids, and what makes me most proud is that in most of my career I have created my own opportunities. I decided at a young age that I wanted a career in dance, and I am thankful for my wild ambition and stubborn personality for making it happen!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is a story that takes place ten months after the JFK assassination and two months after the passage of the Civil Rights Act.  In September of 1964, the tenacious women of the LBJ White House launched what was previously unheard of:  a whistle stop campaign tour that would take the First Lady (unaccompanied by her husband) through hostile political territory.  The central character of the play is Liz Carpenter (Press Secretary to Lady Bird Johnson), who travels back in time from her 1980s hot tub to 1964 Jim Crow South via the caboose platform of the Lady Bird Special.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since we are not founded by the government, the funds are a big issue .And that's where you step in!<br/><br/>As we said, we do all of our work ourselves - sewing, building, directing, etc. So we can save a bunch of money, but we still need it for:<br/>*materials for costumes<br/>*materials for the set<br/>*space rental for rehearsals and performance<br/>*lights and sound<br/>*fees for participants <br/>*copyright<br/>*make up<br/>*promotion<br/>*travel expenses<br/><br/>This project needs 26 000 USD, which would be ideal. We plan to give at least 5% of all income to a local animal shelter, 'cause we just love animals!</p>
<p>If the project does not reach the entire goal, we will still do our best to make this show happen, and to do something good for the animals, too.  However, if we reach more than we had hoped for, we need to do something meaningful with that amount. So, we talked it over, and we agreed to invest it in a participation on Edinburgh Fringe festival 2019.!</p>

Since we are not founded by the government, the funds are a big issue .And that's where you step in!As we said, we do all of our work ourselves - sewing, building, directing, etc. So we can save a bunch of money, but we still need it for:*materials for costumes*materials for the set*space rental for rehearsals and performance*lights and sound*fees for participants *copyright*make up*promotion*travel expensesThis project needs 26 000 USD, which would be ideal. We plan to give at least 5% of all income to a local animal shelter, 'cause we just love animals!
If the project does not reach the entire goal, we will still do our best to make this show happen, and to do something good for the animals, too.  However, if we reach more than we had hoped for, we need to do something meaningful with that amount. So, we talked it over, and we agreed to invest it in a participation on Edinburgh Fringe festival 2019.!

<h3>Summary   </h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Jonathan Tipton Meyers, a NYC writer and performer living in Los Angeles.  After losing my company, my relationship and my so-called ""identity"" at 50,  I became a  Rideshare driver to save my mortgage.  This hour-long performance chronicles my 2-year journey with UBER and Lyft and explores how navigating this massive city with strangers helped me relocate myself. I am ridiculously excited for you to come along on this wild ride. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What your ticket and support will cover: </h3>
<p>My goal is to get this production up on its feet, in preparation for a longer run, a book and potential a tv series. This Campaign is about TICKET RESERVATIONS! I want you to COME ALONG in person or virtually!</p>
<p>100% of your support will go towards:</p>
<p>- The Sacred Fools Theater Studio, Insurance,  Director and Stage Manager. </p>
<p>- Costs for being involved with the Hollywood Fringe</p>
<p>- 2 Camera Video Documentation with Photography</p>
<p>- Advertisements so we can make sure we have sold out shows and create as much exposure as possible</p>
<p>- Rehearsal and tech space</p>
<p>- Playbills and printing</p>
<p>Total needed = $1700!</p>
<p>Production Note: I don't plan on making a profit. Any extra money made will go towards advertising and promotion. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why it matters.</h3>
<p>Whether riding to the airport, or a trip to the ER, blind or disabled people who had no recourse, or hipsters too drunk to navigate the 101 after 2 am, Rideshare has become a vital part of Los Angeles. Helping us not only get around, which was virtually impossible without a car, but also re-socializing a segregated city. By literally taking us out of our ""bubbles"" and connecting to places and each other, we can't help but acknowledge that we're in this city together. That's a good thing. I want to spread that message. </p>
</div><div>

</div><p> </p></div>","Summary   
Hello! I'm Jonathan Tipton Meyers, a NYC writer and performer living in Los Angeles.  After losing my company, my relationship and my so-called ""identity"" at 50,  I became a  Rideshare driver to save my mortgage.  This hour-long performance chronicles my 2-year journey with UBER and Lyft and explores how navigating this massive city with strangers helped me relocate myself. I am ridiculously excited for you to come along on this wild ride. 

What your ticket and support will cover: 
My goal is to get this production up on its feet, in preparation for a longer run, a book and potential a tv series. This Campaign is about TICKET RESERVATIONS! I want you to COME ALONG in person or virtually!
100% of your support will go towards:
- The Sacred Fools Theater Studio, Insurance,  Director and Stage Manager. 
- Costs for being involved with the Hollywood Fringe
- 2 Camera Video Documentation with Photography
- Advertisements so we can make sure we have sold out shows and create as much exposure as possible
- Rehearsal and tech space
- Playbills and printing
Total needed = $1700!
Production Note: I don't plan on making a profit. Any extra money made will go towards advertising and promotion. 

Why it matters.
Whether riding to the airport, or a trip to the ER, blind or disabled people who had no recourse, or hipsters too drunk to navigate the 101 after 2 am, Rideshare has become a vital part of Los Angeles. Helping us not only get around, which was virtually impossible without a car, but also re-socializing a segregated city. By literally taking us out of our ""bubbles"" and connecting to places and each other, we can't help but acknowledge that we're in this city together. That's a good thing. I want to spread that message. 

Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>TARTE is a unique performance institution established by Ayse Eldek-Richardson in May of 2010. While the company’s primary emphasis is on performing Turkish classics and original works by Turkish and Turkish-American writers, plays and musical submissions with Turkish or Middle-Eastern themes are considered from American and international writers as well so as to present a repertoire of quality works to a wide range of Western audiences.</p>
<p>Our productions explore aspects of Turkish and Middle Eastern identity that may be unfamiliar or unknown to many in the United States. Turkish and Middle Eastern culture developed over many centuries and each work we produce has its own related signature and design reflecting a past or current aspect of that cultural development. We hope to broaden the perception of what Turkish and Middle Eastern culture is and what it can be.</p>
<p>TARTE's seasons included plays and musicals as well as readings and educational workshops aimed at younger audiences in the kindergarten to 5th grade age range through its Performing Arts Lab, AKA Drama Club. We also have a Dance Theater project. Of particular success, has been TARTE’s annual One Act Play Festival.</p>
<p>Past TARTE productions include: “To Love...”, a fictional love story about the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, performed at Symphony Space on Broadway and 95th Street on New York’s Upper Westside; an original children’s musical entitled, “Keloglan: Bald Boy; The Musical” and “Bellini and The Sultan,” a play by an American Kennedy Awards winning writer Ed Stevens that played to sold out audiences at the NY Fringe Festival in 2013. We did a co-production of “Unseen Visitor” with Athena Theatre this past season at the Symphony Space. We also sponsored a fund raiser for refugee children entitled “Peace at Home Peace in the World” engaging various artists to perform.</p>
<p>We want to bring you more original and unique performances by Turkish and American writers. This campaign will help us to do that.</p>

<p>Now well into our fourth season, we still wholeheartedly believe and full-throatedly proclaim our belief that:</p>
<p>In an age where the notion of “neighborhood” is fast evolving into a series of intangible on-line social media webpages, A Public Fit aims to reinvigorate the tangible community by working with emerging Las Vegas artists to create exciting, innovative and provocative professional theater. APF believes strongly in the communal power of great stories, dramatic ideas and the sincere engagement that audiences find in challenging theatrical events. A Public Fit genuinely hopes to unite professional artists and audiences through the most effective form of human connection, treating each production as the beginning of an unending conversation.</p>

<p>Our recent PAST</p>
<p>A Public Fit’s on-going series of free monthly staged readings captured the imagination of an ever-growing audience of theatre aficionados who braved SRO crowds.  Our first fully-realized production, Dawn King’s <i>Foxfinder</i>, was met with critical and commercial success, selling out its November 2014 run and garnering 11 Las Vegas Valley Theatre Award nominations - including wins for Best Play, Best Director and Best Lighting Design - nominations in every category for which it was eligible.  The following season, APF challenged the very role of the audience itself with its world-premiere production of “A Summons from the Tinker to Assemble the Membership in Secret at the Usual Place”, an original piece that once again dominated the Valley Awards, winning Best Ensemble Cast as well as the coveted Audience Choice Award.  APF’s second show that year, Gina Gionfriddo’s modern comedy <i>Becky Shaw</i>, saw multiple acting nominations as well.  Our 2016-2017 season left audiences gasping - Andrew Bovell's <i>When the Rain Stops Falling</i>, Martin McDonagh's <i>The Beauty Queen of Leenane</i> and Will Eno's <i>The Realistic Joneses</i> raised the Las Vegas production bar to a thrilling new high.  This is the kind of flat-out, take-no-prisoners theatre that A Public Fit continues to thrive on.  And it’s why APF was named Best Theatre Company in Las Vegas by the Las Vegas Weekly immediately following our inaugural season.  And then again, just this year by KNPR's <i>Desert Companion</i>.  </p>

<p>Our Vegas CULTURE</p>
<p>Las Vegas is evolving still.  As the valley’s neon glow continues to be a beacon for cultural emigrants from across the nation, A Public Fit has actively sought out to embrace those looking for an innovative, professional, theatrical oasis in the literal desert.  Our aesthetic is unique, our vision unparalleled, our commitment unrivaled, our energy unmatched.   And while Las Vegas still draws the most talented people on the planet to perform in its spectacular strip extravaganzas, the need for cultural expression of a more connective nature still burns fiercely in the breasts of these creative super-stars.  A Public Fit exists to give voice to these yearnings, to harness the prolific desires of those artistic visionaries that land here in the valley.</p>
<p>“The artistic team driving APF to the forefront believes and embraces the notion that theatre is for everyone, it will always be relevant and it is a vital part of our community's culture.”</p>
<p>-Melanie Jupp, Assistant Program Manager, Education and Outreach, The Smith Center</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our PLEA</p>
<p>Please help us continue what we’ve started - an even larger, continuing season with 3 fully-realized productions and 4 free-to-the-public staged readings; expanded, 4-week runs of shows; our continued commitment to explore the challenges of ‘found space’ production; the drive to maintain our standing as Las Vegas’ only professional theatre company.   Add your voice to the growing chorus of those who demand more from the Las Vegas cultural landscape.  Sing proudly with us our anthems of optimism and audacity.  We’ve proven that nothing that happens in Vegas stays in Vegas; in fact, what happens in Vegas should shake the artistic pillars of the nation!  And, of course, as a nationally registered and verified non-profit organization, all donations to A Public Fit are tax-deductible to the full extent of applicable tax law!</p>
<p>AND FINALLY:</p>
<p>This year APF has been given a wonderful gift:  an anonymous benefactor has pledged to match ANY increase made by donors from previous years!  Increase your contribution from $100 to $150, and this generous lunatic will match the $50 - WITH ABSOLUTELY NO LIMIT! There's no better time, no better opportunity to get the very most out of your support of Las Vegas' premiere theatre company! Donate now!</p>

Las Vegas is evolving still.  As the valley’s neon glow continues to be a beacon for cultural emigrants from across the nation, A Public Fit has actively sought out to embrace those looking for an innovative, professional, theatrical oasis in the literal desert.  Our aesthetic is unique, our vision unparalleled, our commitment unrivaled, our energy unmatched.   And while Las Vegas still draws the most talented people on the planet to perform in its spectacular strip extravaganzas, the need for cultural expression of a more connective nature still burns fiercely in the breasts of these creative super-stars.  A Public Fit exists to give voice to these yearnings, to harness the prolific desires of those artistic visionaries that land here in the valley.
“The artistic team driving APF to the forefront believes and embraces the notion that theatre is for everyone, it will always be relevant and it is a vital part of our community's culture.”
-Melanie Jupp, Assistant Program Manager, Education and Outreach, The Smith Center
 
Our PLEA
Please help us continue what we’ve started - an even larger, continuing season with 3 fully-realized productions and 4 free-to-the-public staged readings; expanded, 4-week runs of shows; our continued commitment to explore the challenges of ‘found space’ production; the drive to maintain our standing as Las Vegas’ only professional theatre company.   Add your voice to the growing chorus of those who demand more from the Las Vegas cultural landscape.  Sing proudly with us our anthems of optimism and audacity.  We’ve proven that nothing that happens in Vegas stays in Vegas; in fact, what happens in Vegas should shake the artistic pillars of the nation!  And, of course, as a nationally registered and verified non-profit organization, all donations to A Public Fit are tax-deductible to the full extent of applicable tax law!
AND FINALLY:
This year APF has been given a wonderful gift:  an anonymous benefactor has pledged to match ANY increase made by donors from previous years!  Increase your contribution from $100 to $150, and this generous lunatic will match the $50 - WITH ABSOLUTELY NO LIMIT! There's no better time, no better opportunity to get the very most out of your support of Las Vegas' premiere theatre company! Donate now!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A fully realized, written, connected, fun, yet meaningful evening of entertainment and charitable giving. That is what DDD is all about. </p>
<p>For the last Ten years, I've been using my BFA in a way that I never imagined. The art of drag has allowed me to play some pivotal roles that I never thought would be possible. In addition to that, I've been blessed with an awesome fundraising platform. Every year on my birthday, I've put together a fundraiser for Broadway Cares and other local charities. Since this is the final year of my twenties, I want to make this fundraiser the biggest one I've ever done. I can't do that without your help. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The grand total for what we need will be in the neighborhood of $4,000. This all goes towards Renting the theatre, fees for the musicians, costuming, marketing, performance rights, and technical design for the show. </li>
<li>Donors will have a few great perks that come with your donation depending on what level you reach. Perks like a private meet &amp; greet after the show, a private invited rehearsal that lets you see behind the scenes where the magic happens, a personal thank you from Desiré herself, producers credit in the shows playbill, a huge discount on tickets, and more!</li>
<li>If we are unable to reach our fundraising goal. We will split the funds that were raised and send them to the charities that we had intended to send our profits to. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Like I said earlier, there is a huge disconnect in this city between the Theatre community, and the Drag community. If we can put this show together, I whole heartedly believe that it will be a step in the right direction of reconnecting the two. More importantly, it would help raise money that these organizations desperately need. </p>
<p>To be 110% honest, I know there are risks to any sort of project like this. My background in creative problem solving, &amp; finding solutions will help us overcome hurdles and challenges along the way. With your help, my team &amp; I will be able to continue to make this show a reality. </p>

It will be a new iteration, welcoming new cast members and new design team.  The cast includes some returning members and alumni students and faculty from the university and professionals from the local area.  Music is written and orchestrated by Tim Eriksen a local grammy nominated musician.</p><p>Milan Dragicevich  (Playwright) is an Associate Professor of Theater at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His specialty areas are performance, rhetoric, playwriting, harnessing the power of classical techniques in creating contemporary works that resonate with today’s complex world. As an actor, he has performed with numerous nationally acclaimed theaters, including the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Hartford Stage, Pasadena Playhouse, and Northern New England Repertory Theatre. He has become increasingly interested in using his performance background to craft original new works, plays that are physical, actor-driven, combining live music, muscular language, an epic sweep and bold staging.

The play explores the memory of family, the search for identity and acceptance in a new land, as well as the myriad meanings of refugee and how that experience shapes one’s destiny—and creates generational aftershocks. The play’s events will unfurl ironically against the backdrop of Syrian and Iraqi refugees flowing across today’s Serbia.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Joon Dance is a professional dance company based at the Torch Theatre in Milford Haven. The<br/>company creates touring performances, specialising in performance for young people. High-quality dance in the community is at the heart of our mission: every work by Joon Dance includes an element of involvement with audiences and participants. As well as participatory dance projects for children and young people, we run intensive workshops year-round and provide training and mentoring for young artists developing their careers.</p>
<p><br/>Our goals are to bring dance to everyone - dance as personal expression, dance as activism, dance for health, dance to connect, dance for social change. TONGUES furthers our model of high-quality professional dance work in the community, working with a new age group (young adults aged 14-21) using a model of work devised over a number of previous projects and piloted in a small test last summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About Tongues</strong></h3>
<p>The tongue is where the brain and the body can be most tangibly felt to intersect. It is the<br/>muscle with which we express our thoughts. It is also the place where expression can be blocked, we may be tongue-tied. The word ‘tongue’ conjures up ideas like language, identity, and sense of self. It is central to communication and understanding; without language and self-expression how can we create healthy friendships and keep ourselves emotionally and physically safe in sexual relationships? These issues are vital to supporting young people to have a voice and to use it, and to have a body and use it, and to connect the two.</p>
<p>TONGUES is inherently Welsh and connects young people from rural (Brecon) and urban (Cardiff) environments addressing ideas and identities emerging from these different experiences. With TONGUES, we are targeting an age group (14-21 years) not often catered to with dance and performance, and where the young people's relationship with their physical body and with the idea of ‘self’ is transient, changing and evolving.</p>
<p>Tongues is supported by Arts Council Wales, Dawns Powys Dance, Rubicon Dance, Chapter (Cardiff) and Theatr Brycheiniog (Brecon). We are seeking additional support to complete our project budget.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>TONGUES is supported by Arts Council Wales, Dawns Powys Dance, Chapter (Cardiff) and Theatr Brycheiniog (Brecon). We are seeking additional support to complete our project budget. Your support will enable us to offer these workshops to young people in both Cardiff and Brecon free of charge, so that the project is accessible to everyone regardless of circumstance. </p>
<p>We have some great rewards for you including special cast thank-you videos, t-shirts and meet and greets with the team - take a look below! For rewards including t-shirts, please message us with your size and colour choices. </p>
<p>In addition, the first ten donors at any level will receive a special reward video revealing the research behind TONGUES. Watch our social media to see the project unfold!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We know from our past work that dance boosts self esteem, improves team work and<br/>communication skills and is good for physical health. Spoken word is a valuable tool for teaching young people to be articulate, creative and to speak out about their beliefs and feelings.</p>
<p><br/>By working with the young people in a series of intensive week-long workshop programmes, we will create a performance with the young people that is unique to them and expresses their thoughts and feelings on topics that are meaningful to them, and perform the piece at a local theatre. Our experience tells us that learning creative skills and working towards a performance shared with others requires teamwork and negotiation skills, and leads to increased confidence and improved self-esteem associated with making something personal and exploring new ways to use the voice and body.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>TONGUES builds on our previous work and we are working with an excellent team of dance artists and creative practitioners to bring high-quality participation and performance work to the community. We are also supported by our project partners to reach young people in each area and make sure we have a great group to work with in each venue. </p>
<p>The project will go ahead if we don't reach our total funding goal but in a reduced form, which we would obviously prefer not to have to do. By supporting this project you will be ensuring it is free at the point of access for all who want to take part, making sure TONGUES is open to the widest range of people possible. </p>

<h3><strong>“Oh ye Gods…Alas… Why call I on things so weak for help?”<br/>-Hecuba, Trojan Women</strong></h3>
<p><i>In perhaps the first recorded piece of theater in the Western canon that passes the Bechdel test, Euripides’ Trojan Women tells a story of women who are stronger than gods. Trojan Women offers an unapologetic and powerful look at the act of community-building during times of grief, the gendered violence of war, and the messy aftermath of both real and mythic Greek conquests. Written circa 415 BCE and set immediately after the Trojan War, Trojan Women follows in real time the lives of nine remaining Trojan women (and two Greek men) as their city is captured. Project Nongenue digs up, reworks, and breathes life into this historical text through movement, modern and classical language, and intersectional storytelling.</i></p>
<p><i>At Project Nongenue, we believe classical stories have, over many centuries, shaped our understandings of identity, justice and morality. By centering marginalized voices and using a contemporary lens to challenge the archetypes, stereotypes and lessons these foundational stories teach, we examine the way these timeless themes continue to exist in ourselves.</i></p>
<h3>We recognize that changing the world through independent classical theater may seem like a wild dream, but with your help, it can be a reality.</h3>
<p>We know we cannot do this alone. Participating in a festival is a big step for our company, and with big steps come big price tags: registration fees, advertising, theater rentals, set and costume design. Perhaps most importantly, however, is Project Nongenue's commitment to compensating our actors and creative team for their work. After all production costs are covered, the profit we make goes back to the artists (who, in LA blackbox theater, are often unpaid for their work). <strong> Your contributions will directly support young artists working for excellence and social change. </strong>The more we raise here, the more we can give back to our artists. </p>
<p>Our company is still only just beginning. But in my short time at the artistic helm of this group (and after two unmistakably successful productions), I can assure you of a couple things: I have never been exposed to artists of such talent and courage and heart as I have been at Project Nongenue. <strong>When you tilt the focus of narrative onto those people who have been systematically excluded from many of our most foundational stories, the world does change. </strong>It could change for an audience member who sees Helen of Troy for the first time as a nuanced, three-dimensional person instead of a villainous seductress or doe-eyed victim. It could change for an actor in the room who is asked to expand her shoulders to play a Hero and realizes she has spent most of her life trying to take up as little physical space as possible. These may be small moments, but string enough small moments together and you have a cultural shift. Women, people of color, queer people, people of different sizes- we all deserve to be Heroes and we all deserve to be Ingenues. </p>
<p>We want to be a part of this change with you. <strong>Your donations will go such an enormously long way, as artists making a living wage for their work is rare thing. </strong>If finances are tight right now, however, there are other options. Come to the show, share this campaign with your friends, help us fill up our seats at Fringe. Make some noise for progressive classical theater.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support, and please feel free to reach out to learn more by checking out our website (<a href=""http://www.projectnongenue.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.projectnongenue.org</a>) or emailing us (projectnongenue@gmail.com).</p>
<p>Let's break open the confines of the ingenue to see what is revealed, and what new we can build.</p>
<p>Love,</p>

</div></div>","“Oh ye Gods…Alas… Why call I on things so weak for help?”-Hecuba, Trojan Women
In perhaps the first recorded piece of theater in the Western canon that passes the Bechdel test, Euripides’ Trojan Women tells a story of women who are stronger than gods. Trojan Women offers an unapologetic and powerful look at the act of community-building during times of grief, the gendered violence of war, and the messy aftermath of both real and mythic Greek conquests. Written circa 415 BCE and set immediately after the Trojan War, Trojan Women follows in real time the lives of nine remaining Trojan women (and two Greek men) as their city is captured. Project Nongenue digs up, reworks, and breathes life into this historical text through movement, modern and classical language, and intersectional storytelling.
At Project Nongenue, we believe classical stories have, over many centuries, shaped our understandings of identity, justice and morality. By centering marginalized voices and using a contemporary lens to challenge the archetypes, stereotypes and lessons these foundational stories teach, we examine the way these timeless themes continue to exist in ourselves.
We recognize that changing the world through independent classical theater may seem like a wild dream, but with your help, it can be a reality.
We know we cannot do this alone. Participating in a festival is a big step for our company, and with big steps come big price tags: registration fees, advertising, theater rentals, set and costume design. Perhaps most importantly, however, is Project Nongenue's commitment to compensating our actors and creative team for their work. After all production costs are covered, the profit we make goes back to the artists (who, in LA blackbox theater, are often unpaid for their work).  Your contributions will directly support young artists working for excellence and social change. The more we raise here, the more we can give back to our artists. 
Our company is still only just beginning. But in my short time at the artistic helm of this group (and after two unmistakably successful productions), I can assure you of a couple things: I have never been exposed to artists of such talent and courage and heart as I have been at Project Nongenue. When you tilt the focus of narrative onto those people who have been systematically excluded from many of our most foundational stories, the world does change. It could change for an audience member who sees Helen of Troy for the first time as a nuanced, three-dimensional person instead of a villainous seductress or doe-eyed victim. It could change for an actor in the room who is asked to expand her shoulders to play a Hero and realizes she has spent most of her life trying to take up as little physical space as possible. These may be small moments, but string enough small moments together and you have a cultural shift. Women, people of color, queer people, people of different sizes- we all deserve to be Heroes and we all deserve to be Ingenues. 
We want to be a part of this change with you. Your donations will go such an enormously long way, as artists making a living wage for their work is rare thing. If finances are tight right now, however, there are other options. Come to the show, share this campaign with your friends, help us fill up our seats at Fringe. Make some noise for progressive classical theater.
Thank you so much for your support, and please feel free to reach out to learn more by checking out our website (www.projectnongenue.org) or emailing us (projectnongenue@gmail.com).
Let's break open the confines of the ingenue to see what is revealed, and what new we can build.
Love,

<p>I'm Lyralen Kaye. I'm a queer inner city multicultural activist, actor, award-winning writer, director, likes-to-cause-trouble person.  After Trump was elected, I convinced my partner to sell our condo and move to Canada.</p>
<p>Oh, if it was only that easy!</p>
<p>The immigration process forced me to confront my deepest personal secret, and the ridiculousness of how I handled that is...well, isn't it the human story?</p>
<p>My team-Marc, Jude, Teddy, Dave and Caitlin--and I are running this campaign to be able to take this story-with its comedy and revelations , with its marriage struggles and amazing discoveries of kindness--on the road. I believe that telling the truth about ourselves, and laughing, are ways to connect in a time of so much fragmentation. I want to be part of creating a new story, one in which we connect to each other, tell our secrets, and think about the walls we really need to take down.  We make art to see and find ourselves. And we contribute to the world, because, ""it just takes a small group of concerned citizens to change it .""</p>
<p>With your donation, we will perform the show in Boston, Brighton UK, and Hollywood (we've also entered to perform in Vancouver, Providence and Melbourne). All our donors matter to us...and since we are so focused on community-building, we just keep adding connection to our perks. ..more community, more involvement. We're all about fun, but also about really knowing each other and each other's stories.</p>
<p>Each production costs somewhere between $4-7K, so our goal is to raise at least $16K in the next 6 weeks. That money goes to marketing, venues, to purchase music and gobo lighting effects, to the artists and crew, and to the festivals that make performance possible. (*And for those of you who are more visual in nature, pie charts of the budgets are at the end.)</p>
<p>This project means a great deal to me because I'm outing myself-not as gay, everyone knows I'm gay-but as a person with hidden struggles and secrets. The whole process of immigration made  me determined to be much more transparent about who I am, because the saying, ""You're only as sick as your secrets,"" seemed relevant, but less so than, ""No one can own you if you own who you are.""</p>
<p>This transparency takes the show into the personal and then far beyond...because if I connect with you, with my community, I open the door for you to connect with me, too. And I live for that. I live for the moments we come together...and boy do we ever need to come together right now .</p>
<p>We know that raising money and inspiring people to invest both financially and emotionally in a project is a challenge. But since many of us have worked together before at Another Country-Jude since its inception, Marc since 2010 as a producer and production manager, and Caitlin as a director-we understand the nature of grassroots work. We have a history of teaching tolerance and bringing large numbers of people to reach a common goal. We think we can do it again!</p>
<p>We’re asking everyone to give what they can—and we have perks to express our gratitude. We really thank you, whether you can give $250 or $10. We’re reaching out to everyone we know, because if 1600 people give $10, then our village has supported us. Of course, if 4 people do $4000, that is equally true.</p>
<p>We do need A LOT of people to give $10 (think grassroots, of the people), so please use the IndieGogo share tools (the icons next to the back it button), and let people know what we're doing. We would so appreciate it! And of course, if you’re one of the people who can do more, we appreciate that, too! </p>
<p>Thank you so much for coming to our page and being interested in our story. Resist! And tell people who you are. We have to keep being human to each other.</p>
<p>Be well,</p>
<p>Lyralen, Jude, Teddy, Marc, Caitlin &amp; Dave</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Guessworks started life back in 2015 with a five star reviewed production of The Star Rover, made in collaboration with our friends Shedload Theatre (‘The sort of show that leaves you gasping for words that never fully materialise’ ★★★★★ edfringereview). We then performed a small scale production of Pirandello’s ‘The Man With the Flower in His Mouth’ at the Maddermarket Emerson Studio in Norwich. After a brief hiatus for life, love and drama school we are now back with new ideas and a mission statement to make theatre that is full of heart.</p>
<h3>The show we’ve made</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our new show is called Son of Jim and it’s the real story of the discovery of a piece of buried family treasure. It goes a little something like this:</p>
<p>’One day, Dave was rooting through a desk drawer in his parents’ house when he came across an brown A4 paper envelope...he opened it to find a story, written three decades ago, by his dad...’ Thus began the strange journey into the mind of a parent, and a mission to fulfil the dreams of an unpublished primary school teacher.</p>
<p>It’s weird, it’s wonderful, it’s full of imagination, and it’s an affirmation of the bonds that tie fathers and sons together.</p>
<h3>Here’s why we need you</h3>
<p>We have our Edinburgh venue in place. We now need to raise the money to get the show there. Guessworks, like 99.9% of theatre companies, is a financially impoverished theatre company. Would we have it any other way? Yes, yes we would. But until the National Theatre comes knocking we rely on the support of friends to keep us alive!</p>
<p>We have a £3000 crowdfunding target.</p>
<p>This just covers our venue hire for the month (£2970), and the rest of our expenditure (Fringe registration, marketing materials, production costs) is self funded.</p>
<p>Every pound and penny that we receive goes towards the cost of our venue hire. And it makes a massive difference.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>PERKS!</h3>
<p>Here’s how we express our love to our backers:</p>
<p>We have badges!</p>
<p>We have prints of original artwork made for the show!</p>
<p>We have unique poems written especially for you!</p>
<p>We have free tickets available!</p>
<p>These things and stuff will be yours as a token of our massive appreciation.</p>

<p>To be honest we tried to do everything with just two of us, but after few trials we figured out that doing a burlesque performance in the park was a very bad idea, so we need a venue. We also think that we could play four characters - but it would probably be quite awful for the audience, so we need actors. We really wanted to create our own songs, but someone told us that we weren't talented enough... I'm afraid they’re right.

<p>Paper is the origin of every text so even the origin of a piece of theatre. It's also often bearer of our ideas, we write on it our thoughts, we draw on it our sets, our costumes. It's also easy to make it disappear as an idea or a feeling. We can crumple it, fold it, cut it, like we can handle our body.

We deliver arts education and site-specific performances to communities up and down the West Coast. Now, we have an opportunity to present our work and community development methodology to international audiences...but we need your help to get there!</p><p>HDD has been invited to present at the 2018 Tanzmesse Dance Festival in Düsseldorf, Germany. The company will perform ""A Bela e a Fera (Beauty and the Beast)"", inspired by the story of the same name written by acclaimed Jewish Brazilian author Clarice Lispector. However, this isn't your grandmother's fairy tale--""A Bela a Fera"" explores intimacy, female identity, and income inequality. Experimenting with the idea of ""self as site,"" HDD's soloist will embody the interior lives of the characters in the story.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529951501/p9a79pewmfteloewefze.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Though class divide breeds confusion and mistrust between Lispector’s characters, they also find brief moments of connection. Duckler’s piece examines the construction and erosion of these characters’ worldviews through movement, as well as eliciting a collaboration between audience and performer, music and text, English and Portuguese.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529951555/vdo9dghp7exvpnwz8bk4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Bringing this piece to Tanzmesse 2018 will allow Heidi Duckler Dance to scale its innovative site-specific and multi-disciplinary approach to dance internationally, providing the greater dance community with greater tools to engage both within and across métiers. </p><p>Our projects would not be possible without the guidance of our Board and Advisory Board members.</p><p><strong>Heidi Duckler Dance Board</strong></p><p>Jamarah Hayner, JKH Consulting</p><p>Michael Anderson, BASE Architecture</p><p>John Friedman, JFAK Architects</p><p>Mary Ann Braubach, Huxley on Huxley</p><p>Connie Ramirez, Union Bank</p><p>Danielle Valentino, METRO</p><p>Lisa Quateman, Polsinelli</p><p>Adam Englander, Englander Knabes &amp; Allen</p><p>Lisa Gilmour, Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</p><p>Terez Kreisz, Philanthropist</p><p>Tom Majich, Arroyo Hill Development</p><p>Deena Selenow, Occidental College</p><p>Mark Walsh, Artshare L.A.</p><p><strong>Heidi Duckler Dance Advisory Board</strong></p><p>Liliane Corzo, Capital Group</p><p>Olga Garay-English, Ford Theatre</p><p>Lorcan O'Herlihy, LOHA</p><p>Jan Perry, Los Angeles Economic and Workforce Development</p><p>Sarah Pillsbury, Liberty Hill Foundation</p><p>Craig Watson, California Arts Council</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Participating in Tanzmesse will be a valuable cultural exchange experience in which we will share with and learn from a range of international artists.

From our inter-generational arts education programs to our collaborations with institutions such as the UCLA Labor Center, Heidi Duckler Dance is pushing the envelope of what is possible in the world of dance. Art is a key tool to addressing social distance in our communities, fostering communication, thought, and expression that lead to action. We plan to present these myriad potentials of dance to our international collaborators.</span></p><p>Since founding the company in 1985, HDD's Artistic/Executive Director, Heidi Duckler, has choreographed more than 300 original dance works at unique sites across East LA, Southern California and around the world. Dubbed ""the reigning queen of site-specific performance,"" by the LA Times, Duckler has received major commissions from Grand Performances, REDCAT, the Autry Museum of the American West, Brookfield Properties, and Occidental and Pomona Colleges, among others.

We deliver arts education and site-specific performances to communities up and down the West Coast. Now, we have an opportunity to present our work and community development methodology to international audiences...but we need your help to get there!HDD has been invited to present at the 2018 Tanzmesse Dance Festival in Düsseldorf, Germany. The company will perform ""A Bela e a Fera (Beauty and the Beast)"", inspired by the story of the same name written by acclaimed Jewish Brazilian author Clarice Lispector. However, this isn't your grandmother's fairy tale--""A Bela a Fera"" explores intimacy, female identity, and income inequality. Experimenting with the idea of ""self as site,"" HDD's soloist will embody the interior lives of the characters in the story.Though class divide breeds confusion and mistrust between Lispector’s characters, they also find brief moments of connection. Duckler’s piece examines the construction and erosion of these characters’ worldviews through movement, as well as eliciting a collaboration between audience and performer, music and text, English and Portuguese.Bringing this piece to Tanzmesse 2018 will allow Heidi Duckler Dance to scale its innovative site-specific and multi-disciplinary approach to dance internationally, providing the greater dance community with greater tools to engage both within and across métiers. Our projects would not be possible without the guidance of our Board and Advisory Board members.Heidi Duckler Dance BoardJamarah Hayner, JKH ConsultingMichael Anderson, BASE ArchitectureJohn Friedman, JFAK ArchitectsMary Ann Braubach, Huxley on HuxleyConnie Ramirez, Union BankDanielle Valentino, METROLisa Quateman, PolsinelliAdam Englander, Englander Knabes & AllenLisa Gilmour, Pancreatic Cancer Action NetworkTerez Kreisz, PhilanthropistTom Majich, Arroyo Hill DevelopmentDeena Selenow, Occidental CollegeMark Walsh, Artshare L.A.Heidi Duckler Dance Advisory BoardLiliane Corzo, Capital GroupOlga Garay-English, Ford TheatreLorcan O'Herlihy, LOHAJan Perry, Los Angeles Economic and Workforce DevelopmentSarah Pillsbury, Liberty Hill FoundationCraig Watson, California Arts Council  The ImpactParticipating in Tanzmesse will be a valuable cultural exchange experience in which we will share with and learn from a range of international artists. Our works are tailor fit to every environment we enter, making for a unique experience shaped both by and for our audiences. From our inter-generational arts education programs to our collaborations with institutions such as the UCLA Labor Center, Heidi Duckler Dance is pushing the envelope of what is possible in the world of dance. Art is a key tool to addressing social distance in our communities, fostering communication, thought, and expression that lead to action. We plan to present these myriad potentials of dance to our international collaborators.Since founding the company in 1985, HDD's Artistic/Executive Director, Heidi Duckler, has choreographed more than 300 original dance works at unique sites across East LA, Southern California and around the world. Dubbed ""the reigning queen of site-specific performance,"" by the LA Times, Duckler has received major commissions from Grand Performances, REDCAT, the Autry Museum of the American West, Brookfield Properties, and Occidental and Pomona Colleges, among others. Through its education programs, HDD has served over 8,000 students in Los Angeles.

<h3>WELCOME!!!</h3>
<p> I'm just a kid who grew up on the lower east side of NYC, raised by my Dominican immigrant mother who taught us the importance of family, spirituality and community. While I never had formal training in theatre, music or the arts in general, I’ve always had a desire to do good, to tell the stories that are familiar to so many of us. I often think about the past men and women who have sacrificed and did so many amazing things for future generations and I aspire to be great like them.</p>
<p>As an artist, I personally feel it is my responsibility to present experiences that can teach, that can introduce audiences to something normally wouldn’t be exposed to. I am proud to have created a show that I hope will open hearts and minds of the audience, stir emotions, think differently, challenge, inspire and motivate. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I have already provided a great deal of funding that has already gone into executing this project but, we could reallyuse your help. <strong>Here's what $10,000 will pay for: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I firmly believe that artists (creatives) deserve to get paid for the work they do.  No one is asked to work for free on this project.</li>
<li>Hiring a lighting designer and sound tech to help increase the quality of the show.</li>
<li>Hiring a stage manager</li>
<li>In our last run, each night was more filled than the night before. That momentum build up was proof of the shows ability to live in an off Broadway theatre. We would love to use part of the funds to help with sustaining the run beyond October.</li>
<li>Another percentage of the funding will go into costumes and props which will also elevate the quality of the show. </li>
<li>One of the key investments we plan to make is to invest in marketing. Up until this point, all of the major success achieved has been through word of mouth from audiences who have seen the show. With the right advertising, the show has a greater chance of being seen by a major investor, production company and a larger audience. </li>
<li>While the team is putting all of our blood sweat and tears into this project, like the creatives, it it is very challengine to find an administrative team that will work for free. </li>
<li>We would love to have a Videographer come in and record a high quality copy of the show. The show in the past has been used as a diversity training tool. Having a HQ copy affords the show more opportunity to be used in educational and non educational institutions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your perks:</h3>
<p>Depending on how much you contribute, there will be some cool perks ranging from T shirts, and posters to an exclusive show soundtrack and personal cartoon image of you!!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One of the most common comments after our show has been ""This show has to live on Broadway. It's not just a show, but a call to action."" One of the reasons the show has been so successful is because it is very accessible. It is very relevant regardless of race. I have seen the impact, the validation audience members have felt and expressed. With a talkback after the show being one of the key components, it creates a platform for the sometimes difficult conversations on race to happen. Given the current climate, this show get people from all different walks of life together to have a conversation about what they have just experienced, and how it is relevant to them. </p>
<p>Another important factor about the show is that it is family friendly. The show is the type of show that the whole family can go see, and have discussions at home about the topic. While the topic of racism can be difficult, the humor and music in the show very accessible.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Of course as with everything there are always risks. Risks of failure, risks of mismanagement of the budget, and so on. But what gives me the most confidence with this show has been it's track record. Having first premiered in 2011, it was relevant then and continues to be relevant today. It has been developed for years, shaped into the great masterpiece it is today. </p>
<p>A huge advantage with this show is that it target audience is literally everyone. It is for kids, it is for adults, it is for White people, it is for people of color, it is for the adopted population, and on and on. Contributing and being a part of this movement can give you the satisfaction that you have a hand in fighting against racial inequalities, educating and entertaining people, and putting out theatre that is truly a vessel for change.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While I know that we all have our lives, our bills, and may not be in a position to financially sustain this movement, you can still help by sharing and trying to get people to donate or come to the show. </p>

What We Need
I have already provided a great deal of funding that has already gone into executing this project but, we could reallyuse your help. Here's what $10,000 will pay for: 

I firmly believe that artists (creatives) deserve to get paid for the work they do.  No one is asked to work for free on this project.
Hiring a lighting designer and sound tech to help increase the quality of the show.
Hiring a stage manager
In our last run, each night was more filled than the night before. That momentum build up was proof of the shows ability to live in an off Broadway theatre. We would love to use part of the funds to help with sustaining the run beyond October.
Another percentage of the funding will go into costumes and props which will also elevate the quality of the show.

<h3>Our Company &amp; Our Project</h3>
<p>We are the after-image, a passionately postmodern theater company embarking on our first fully-produced work, <strong>RE: SHE a litany of adventures</strong>, premiering at the Philadelphia Fringe Festival. </p>
<p><strong>Show dates : </strong>September 13 - 15 + 20 - 22</p>
<p><strong>Location : </strong>PlayArts, a flexible children's play space hosting us for their first theatrical event</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562635233/wolktbjfp3jadhz0c6ny.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Credited as one of the original “lost world” stories, H. Rider Haggard’s<i> She: A History of Adventure</i> has been adapted ad nauseum in a variety of forms from the late 1800s through today. Though each maker of<i> She</i> tailored the narrative for his target audience, each iteration’s archetypes and messages perpetuate racist and misogynistic ideology. She is all the more damaging for inspiring myriad lost world stories rooted in colonialism that we continue to encounter in contemporary media. </p>
<p>Quite the opposite of telling the story again, <strong>RE: SHE a litany of adventures</strong> examines how these stories were told, why these stories were told, and why they were popular. We are looking at the context of each adaptation to subvert them and reclaim the power they stole.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>And while <i>She</i> and her thematic descendants show up everywhere we look, with this project we are drawing on alternative lost world stories that have gotten far less air time. These alternative narratives - envisioned by women and people of color - are guiding the modern day explorers of <strong>RE: SHE</strong> on their path towards individual and historic reckoning.</p>
<p>Your generosity is a critical part of telling this story with and for our community, and we are so grateful for your support.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While our total costs for this production will exceed $13k, for this campaign, as our first priority, we are focused on raising the funds to compensate our dedicated and talented artistic team. </p>
<p>Our $6200 artist budget line covers a group of ten devisors, designers, and stage managers. It also includes two ASL interpreters, a day-hire technician, videographer, and photographer. Producing Artistic Directors, Kate St. John &amp; Amy Shoshana Blumberg are not receiving compensation for their work unless the entire project exceeds its break-even point.</p>
<p>As it is, we are unable to pay our collaborators even a fraction of what they are worth. This project would not exist without their generous allocation of time, talent, and intellect.</p>
<p>In the spirit of generosity, we are excited to thank you for your support by offering perks that reflect our team’s unique process &amp; production.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since RE: SHE primarily addresses race and gender, it is critically important to include as many perspectives as possible in this creative process. In a series of generative workshops, we are devising RE: SHE a litany of adventures with and through the unique viewpoints and experiences of our collaborators. </p>
<p>With this project, we don’t want to erase the past; we want to hold it and make space for it so that we can take away its power. Through the work of our collaborators, RE: SHE will uncover a story that needs to be told now more than ever. We need your support to compensate these brilliant artists as well as we can.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562638175/t8kha5vky8zyxrfxk6td.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While Producing Artistic Directors Kate St. John and Amy Shoshana Blumberg have been a part of the theater community in Philadelphia for 4 years and anticipate an eager response from their Temple University community, the after-image is a new company presenting in a competitive festival. As recent MFA grads, Kate and Amy are eager to share this work with the community they know while reaching a much larger Philadelphia audience. </p>
<p>In addition to our cultivated network of friends, followers, and previous collaborators, we expect that the extended reach of RE: SHE’s devising artists will yield high ticket sales for the duration of the run. And since we are hosting one performance with ASL interpretation, our show will be listed twice in the Fringe festival guide, thereby drawing an even wider audience. </p>
<p>Even with nearly-sold-out houses, though, ticket sales will cover just over a third of our total production needs. We are seeking additional sponsorship from local businesses, but we cannot cover our projected costs without your support.</p>

<p>Kayla Friend here - creator of Ramona, A New Musical, set to premiere in New York City next month as part of the first ever Furnace Festival.  An artist of Mexican, German, Irish, and Native American descent, I am originally from Hemet, California - the very region where Ramona’s life story took place.</p>
<p>Together with Jaime Lozano, James Rushin, Andres Maldonado, Jessy Tomsko, and Brian Cedric Jones, I am thrilled to be bringing the first ever stage-musical adaptation of <i>Ramona to </i>New York City<i>!</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563331014/zbcyipw8axo70o6ohoo6.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p>So...about this campaign you’re reading right now. There is no way around stating that producing theatre in the biggest market in the world is HARD. From space fees, to unexpected costs, to paying all participating artists fairly, to marketing, promotion, and media - it adds up quickly, before a single audience member even walks in the door.</p> <p>With this letter, Ramona’s fundraising campaign is officially live, and we are here to ask for your help. </p> <p>For two staged presentations, the full tech week in the performance space, approximately 40 hours of rehearsal, a 15+ person cast comprised of diverse, gifted artists, we need to raise the entirety of $8900.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Money at Work - What It Looks Like:</h3>
<p>Staged workshops are a critical step towards the expansion of a new show; from performers bringing characters to life, to musicians and writers working together to point out flaws, experiment, and make changes for the better, a show can live or die by the workshop. Our goal is to mold the current version of Ramona into a full-scale commercial production, and your donation will immediately inch us closer to that goal.</p>
<p><br/>Latinx and Native American voices are not often given platforms in the arts - with Ramona, we are working hard to bring to life this true story heard by only a few and a legacy that speaks to our melting pot of a nation then and now, through the eyes of a young woman searching for identity and home.</p>
<h3>The Perks!</h3>
<p>You think we’d just take your money and run? No way! Your donation makes you a part of the Ramona family. From custom lapel pins of Ramona’s signature yellow rose, to hand-written calligraphy of the show’s poetry, to exclusive invitations to a private cocktail party, and of course tickets to the performance - we want to show our gratitude for helping this story come to life.</p>

Ramona's story of loss, love, and destruction explodes under the sharp heel of war, and carries us through her desperate journey in search of family, legacy, and home. 

Kayla Friend here - creator of Ramona, A New Musical, set to premiere in New York City next month as part of the first ever Furnace Festival.  An artist of Mexican, German, Irish, and Native American descent, I am originally from Hemet, California - the very region where Ramona’s life story took place.
Together with Jaime Lozano, James Rushin, Andres Maldonado, Jessy Tomsko, and Brian Cedric Jones, I am thrilled to be bringing the first ever stage-musical adaptation of Ramona to New York City!

So...about this campaign you’re reading right now. There is no way around stating that producing theatre in the biggest market in the world is HARD. From space fees, to unexpected costs, to paying all participating artists fairly, to marketing, promotion, and media - it adds up quickly, before a single audience member even walks in the door. With this letter, Ramona’s fundraising campaign is officially live, and we are here to ask for your help.  For two staged presentations, the full tech week in the performance space, approximately 40 hours of rehearsal, a 15+ person cast comprised of diverse, gifted artists, we need to raise the entirety of $8900.

Your Money at Work - What It Looks Like:
Staged workshops are a critical step towards the expansion of a new show; from performers bringing characters to life, to musicians and writers working together to point out flaws, experiment, and make changes for the better, a show can live or die by the workshop. Our goal is to mold the current version of Ramona into a full-scale commercial production, and your donation will immediately inch us closer to that goal.
Latinx and Native American voices are not often given platforms in the arts - with Ramona, we are working hard to bring to life this true story heard by only a few and a legacy that speaks to our melting pot of a nation then and now, through the eyes of a young woman searching for identity and home.
The Perks!
You think we’d just take your money and run? No way! Your donation makes you a part of the Ramona family. From custom lapel pins of Ramona’s signature yellow rose, to hand-written calligraphy of the show’s poetry, to exclusive invitations to a private cocktail party, and of course tickets to the performance - we want to show our gratitude for helping this story come to life.
Other Ways You Can HelpUnable to donate? Here are some ways that you can help us to spread the word about our campaign and the production: 
Share your own Ramona story on IG, Facebook, Twitter, etc. and use our hashtag #RamonaMusical
Share our campaign with your friends! Blast it out to everyone! Even a $5 donation makes a huge difference when we've got enough folx!
In New York City? Tickets can be purchased here: https://www.centeratwestpark.org/furnace-festival  We will have performances on August 24 and 25. See you there!
Thank you for your support. We can’t wait to share this story with you.See you at the theatre!~ Kayla",3.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>The Story </h3>
<p>A warrior goddess created by the Black Mother Goddesses and adorned in glorious robes of divinity, the celestial Ishtar fiercely guards her temple until the moment a stranger appears and disrupts her sanctuary and her sense of self. Under the counsel of The Black Mother Goddesses, Ishtar flees from the stranger abandoning her home and her beloved companion, The Bull of Heaven. Overcome with loneliness and grief, Ishtar makes a damning choice that forces her to choose between her divinity and her desire. </p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Eternal Theatre Collective is a youth not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing opportunities to young performing artists between the ages of 13 and 25. We believe that young people are just as capable of creating amazing and beautiful theatre - especially when they collaborate with each other and learn from the process. Emerging artists need experience and real theatre work to get their careers started, and we are dedicated to helping them get that experience.</p>
<p>Everyone we work with, from the actors to the designers, the creative team to the managerial team and even the board of directors is under 25 years old. We offer fantastic opportunities for youth to experiment and grow in their craft in a professional and collaborative environment.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>OUR BEGINNINGS</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558130436/wbuhhieswww3qdvkzhrg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We first started after our founder, Forrest Orta, scared his way around Orange County and had a thirst to try something new: creating experiences that cause fear while telling a compelling story. Based in the Orange County area, create stories that take concepts and tell them in a new way and place them in physical locations to truly strike terror in our audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>VALUES</strong></h3>
<p>Although we seek to endure fear in our audience, there are key things we value:</p>
<p><strong>INCLUSION</strong>: CVRDIVC Productions aims to be the space for anyone and everyone. We will never exclude any gender, race, class, sexuality, or ability from experiencing our pieces. The same goes for the staff and cast. Everyone has a thirst for horror and no one should be told that can’t do what they have a passion for based on something they can’t change.</p>
<p><strong>ACCESS</strong>: Art can be very pricey, a factor that shouldn’t exist. We will price our experiences to make our needs but will do everything we can to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to enjoy our creations.</p>
<p><strong>OVERALL SATISFACTION</strong>: At the end of the day, we seek to not only scare you, but we also seek to ensure your enjoyment has been made. This also translates to our staff, cast, and crew. If our people are enjoying what they love to do, the audience will do the same.</p>
<p><strong>YOUTH EMPOWERMENT</strong>: There is a surprising amount of youth that shares the thirst for their wanting of horror. We seek to be the people behind them cheering them on, as well as be there when they struggle with their creative process.</p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>As with most experiences, it takes not only hard work, dedication, and people to bring it to life, but it also takes money to make it happen. We are only asking for $7500.</p>
<p>With this goal, it will allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with locations that best fit our stories</li>
<li>Cast great talent, regardless of gender, race, class, or ability</li>
<li>Produce quality work with long production runs</li>
<li>Purchase props and design costumes</li>
</ul>
<p>Up till now, we have been funding through our day jobs. While it has been very helpful, it's not enough anymore.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>""The Smell of the Kill"" director, Adam Schulmerich, envisioned this production for some of Lights Out Theatre Company's actors several years ago, but it seemed like we might never have the resources to produce this show we had fantasized so much about. But then a disregarded cash box from our previous shows was unearthed &amp; crow-barred open, and lo! there was money to be spent! </p>
<p>Lights Out's meager $3,000 budget represents the highs and lows of almost a decade of artistic collaboration, late nights, hard-learned lessons, &amp; friendship. We're joyfully spending every last cent on a show that embodies the spirit of our company, in the unique space that has allowed us to thrive. ""The Smell of the Kill"" is a high-energy comedy rooted in dark truths; a perfect way to say farewell to our beloved Lights Out.</p>
<p>Through your contributions, we'll be able to give this show its due production value &amp; pay the playwright, Michele Lowe, for the use of her art. You'll improve the experience for the entire audience &amp; help Lights Out Theater Company go out on a high note.</p>
<p>The Lights Out Theatre Company family is grateful for all of the support we've received since we were hopeful, enthusiastic, post-college dummies. Your continued assistance through this final show means the world to us. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have $3,000 and we're trying to raise an additional $1,600. </p>
<p>We understand budgets are tight for many of our supporters, so we appreciate every level of giving. If you're in Chicago &amp; will be enjoying the show, consider that most storefront shows set you back about $30, and we arent charging admission. Whether you make minumum wage or use $100 bills as napkins, we want you to see the show &amp; ask that you donate whatever amount that is meaningful to you. </p>
<p>The largest portion of our budget has gone towards the set &amp; more is needed to complete the look of an upscale kitchen in the suburbs of Chicago. Though we've been very frugal &amp; have found/borrowed excellent pieces, but lumber &amp; truck rentals come at a fixed cost.</p>
<p>We also need to pay for the rights to the script, costume pieces, a license to Qlab to run our fantastic sound design, some props &amp; set dressing, and a bit of stage magic. We strongly believe in paying our designers and actors for their training, time, and talent, so any donations above our goals will go directly to the artists who have worked so hard to bring you this show. </p>
<p><strong>We have some fun perks for the night of the show, like our VIP Treatment. We also have great options for groups who might want to take advantage of some time at The Lincoln Loft. You can even rent the space to use the projector and giant screen or host a roast like a pro! We invite donors at every level to feel proud of supporting the live arts. </strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you don't have money to spare, we'd be grateful for your help in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Come to the show! We're doing all of this because we want to entertain you!</li>
<li>If you have an employer or contact who would like to have a group outing, we can try to accomodate a private event. Email annalu88@gmail.com</li>

<h2><strong>Who we are:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>ASAP Drama:</strong> For more than 1,100 youth in 40 clubs, ASAP Drama nurtures young people’s powers of expression, teamwork skills &amp; cultural knowledge through participating in group performances and attending professional productions. ASAP Drama is an after school initiative of Philadelphia nonprofit, ASAP/After School Activities Partnerships, whose mission is to keep youth safe &amp; engaged after school. <br/><br/><strong>ASPIRA, Inc. of PA:</strong> ASPIRA is a network of 6 public schools dedicated to serving Latino and other vulnerable North Philadelphia youth. It is a community based organization serving underprivileged youth through high-quality, need based education, public advocacy, and<br/>other programs dedicated to empowering communities from within.</p>
<h3><u><strong>Our Story:</strong></u></h3>
<p>This multi-school musical production was borne out of ASAP Drama &amp; ASPIRA’s shared goal to find new, compelling ways to use the dramatic arts to empower the city’s emerging bilingual student population and build a sense of community among participating schools. ASAP and ASPIRA first partnered and piloted the multi-school musical in 2016 with a dual-language production of “Aladdin, Jr.,” followed by “Barrio Grrrl,” in 2017 and “Little Mermaid, Jr.” in 2018.</p>
<p>While English is spoken in ASPIRA's network schools, the surrounding communities and families of the students primarily speak Spanish. In addition, according to statistics from the Philadelphia School District, 15,200 students are first time English learners. This year, ASAP &amp; ASPIRA present a full bilingual production of Fame Jr. in Spanish to create an inclusive and welcoming theatre experience for all, as Philadelphia is a Sanctuary City.</p>

Our first production is Three on a Seesaw, a dramatic comedy by Milan playwright Luigi Lunari and translated by Giorgia Severini and Barrett Hileman. Three on a Seesaw has enjoyed success all around the world for over 25 years.

I want to produce this play in Oakland this fall - but first, I want to stage a reading of the play, and I need your help - I have to rent the theater, pay the actors and director, buy insurance, etc. - please donate whatever you can - contributions are tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law - I’m shooting for a free staged reading of ‘The Glimmer’ on Saturday, August 13 from 1-4 pm, currently available, at The Fight Deck theater at 1540 Broadway at Telegraph in Oakland, with beer, wine, and bottled water available, along with free pizza - if that date is unavailable by the end of the  fund-raising, I’ll try for another Saturday in August at the same venue - date and time of the reading to be announced on my website at 2020glimmer.com - a Question and Answer session will follow the reading - I want your feedback as an audience as to how the play works - you’ll be helping in the development of this play..<br/></p>
<p>  I have written a dozen plays, seven which have been produced - ‘The Glimmer’ has been produced twice as a one-act - once in San Francisco and once in New York City, which is where the video clip was filmed - I have since expanded it, adding two more characters: Maritza, a young Millennial woman and Fred, a fellow worker at the Accelerator - the reading is all about seeing how it will play out as a full-length drama. ‘The Glimmer’ is based on a couple who lived next door to us in a little duplex on the freeway  - but instead of a freeway, I have them living in a duplex under a large urban bridge..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p> - the husband claimed to have been an ex-boxer who later worked at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, until his vision was diminished by radiation exposure - they were alcoholic, had fights we would hear through the thin walls, and I would go over and intervene - after a while, it seemed they would fight just to get me to come over - the husband wanted to teach me about electronics, and had a strange old electronic machine on the floor - I seemed to have become the son they never had - two of the characters, Mike and Lil, are based on that couple and another character, George, is based on myself - after 6 months the couple moved away - I never saw them, again...</p>

<h3>About Lippy</h3>
<p>Edinburgh University’s Theatre Paradok present the first amateur revival of the award-winning play, Lippy by Bush Moukarzel with cameo playwright Mark O'Halloran.</p>
<p>Lippy is a story about how we try to understand the unthinkable. Telling the true story of four women who starved themselves to death in Ireland at the turn of the millennium, Lippy simultaneously attempts to uncover the motives that drove them to ending their lives. The first amateur production of the award-winning Dead Centre production, Lippy is haunting, powerful, unforgettable and at points darkly comic. The show effortlessly plays with the narrative of conventional theatre while exploring the characters of the four women at the show’s heart. <br/>Bringing a new voice to this contemporary classic, Theatre Paradok present a stripped-back version of Dead Centre’s original production, focusing on powerful performances and brutal realism. </p>
<h3>About Theatre Paradok</h3>
<p>Theatre Paradok are Edinburgh University's experimental and alternative theatre company who have been producing multiple productions both in term time and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for many years. Our latest production is one of our most ambitious yet, tackling the challenging and powerful modern drama Lippy, originally produced by Dead Centre at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2014.</p>
<p>But it is not possible for us to put this show on without your help. We need public funding to help us put this show together and it won't be possible unless you help us out! It's a big task putting a show like this together and unfortunately it doesn't come cheap. Lippy is a brutal and powerful drama about fiction, starvation and how we become the tellers of our own stories and we would love the opportunity to bring our take on this story to you this August.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need You!</h3>
<p>We need £550 to afford to put on the production we want. From technical elements like props and lighting to publicity costs such as flyers and posters, this money will help us out dramatically. We want to create a show that is worthy of the script we are working with and for that we need costumes, lights, rehearsal space and lots more. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">But we don't expect you to give us money for nothing and we are offering lots of rewards as thanks for your support.</span></p>
</div><div><p>Theatre Paradok have been producing alternative, experimental and unusual theatre in Scotland's capital for a long time and we have received plenty of praise for our work. From previous Fringe productions like last year's Mrs Dalloway to productions in the last year such as original physical theatre piece 'To Breathe' and a production of Harold Pinter's 'The Hothouse'. Lippy presents fresh challenges for us as a company, putting on a show so heavy in technical elements and difficult performances in such a short space of time. However the experienced cast and crew on board this project have dedicated lots of time to making sure this production is a success and honours the original work.</p></div><div>

From previous Fringe productions like last year's Mrs Dalloway to productions in the last year such as original physical theatre piece 'To Breathe' and a production of Harold Pinter's 'The Hothouse'. Lippy presents fresh challenges for us as a company, putting on a show so heavy in technical elements and difficult performances in such a short space of time. However the experienced cast and crew on board this project have dedicated lots of time to making sure this production is a success and honours the original work.
If you would like to follow the production...

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>After Lincoln's assassination, very soon after, the government and the press conspired to tie up the loose strings surrounding the guilty, declare the case neatly solved and the villains all executed.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 years after the official version of the death of Lincoln's assassin, an alternate history emerged! A man claiming to be John Wilkes Booth made a deathbed confession. The ""Curse of Booth"" tells that story. Part mystery, part adventure, part romance. But is it the Truth?</p>
<p>This is the story of the handsome, acclaimed young actor John Wilkes Booth; loved by many woman, living in high society. What could have led him to throw his glamorous life away and commit  his horrendous crime? Who was really behind it. Someone else was shot in the barn! How did he escape ..... no one could kill him. He outlived everyone and died by his own hand in 1903.</p>
<p>But is it the truth?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The story, as we tell it, is inspired by the 1908 book by Finis Bates and there is evidence, even beyond what we present. There is the agreement among the descendants of the large Booth family and of descendants of John Wilkes himself.</p>
<p>What we present exposes as mythology what passes for history and topples idols from their enshrined pedestals.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We work-shopped at Tisch. We showcased at The Player's Club. Thanks to the response we're creating the multimedia show.</p>
<p>The medium and the message fit perfectly. The action takes place between the time Booth completes his will and his suicide. Booth reviews his life and the audience shares his experience  through projections that emerge on stage as they flash through his mind.</p>
<p>I am  as inspired by the artistic challenge of mixing of live performer and projections as I have been by the subject matter, the script and actors. We need YOUR help to bring this next phase to fruition.</p>
<p>We're looking to raise $40,000 All funds raised here will go toward filming, editing, and creating a fully mobile stage production that can be mounted in any theater.</p>

<h3>Brighton Shakespeare Company</h3>
<p>I am Mark Brailsford, the artistic director and founder of the company, a successful and professional director and producer of shows for over twenty years (The award winning Treason Show being the main production since 2000) but the BSC is not a one man band. I am fortunate to have an incredibly talented and dedicated team to work with and we have the knowledge, experience and talent at our disposal to create magical, well loved productions. Last year we had an enormous success with The Merry Wives of Windsor at BOAT (Brighton Open Air Theatre) and this year with Much Ado About Nothing which also toured to places such as Lewes Castle. Our expansion is based upon hugely appreciative audiences who love our work, comparing us favourably with The Globe in London. In short, we know that performing Macbeth in churches in November will be a spine tingling and thrilling project which we'd love to share with you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to cover so many set up costs for the production, such as: Props, costume (vital!) marketing the show and essentials such as insurance cover. As we are an unfunded company we rely on box office and crowd funding to get this production to happen. You are essential. We are also rolling this out to schools as Macbeth is on the curriculum, so there is a community benefit too. This amount of £2750 is a third of what we need and is formulated on our previous successful crowdfunded campaign for Much Ado About Nothing where we successfully raised the sums required via Kickstarter. We moved to Indiegogo as they were better at transferring amounts and have more attractive terms.</p>
<p>With our theatre touring programme, you get to be part of the excitement not only of making a theatre production work, but one that will thrill and be talked about for years. Opening night party invitations, signed programmes and free tickets are part of the perks. Furthermore we are offering something else, the option to become a friend of the company. This means three things. 1) Invitations to exclusive first nights and last, including the parties. 2) Preferential booking for all future productions including discounted tickets 3) The opportunity to work with us on future productions, whether as a volunteer or even in the show. Alternatively you may wish to Sponsor the show and that will bring you prominence in website, print and social media advertising.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having created two highly successful shows in the traditional Shakespeare summer season with reviews such as ""fantastic performances"", ""hilarious"" and ""the first time I have actually enjoyed Shakespeare"", we now want to expand to create an autumn season with a difference; using wonderful ancient churches as venues.  This means we can bring Shakespeare to a new audience as well as make use of the incredible atmosphere and beauty of the churches. Brighton Shakespeare Company will also be working with schools which is proving incredibly popular as we have already filled workshops and matinee performances aimed specifically at schools in Brighton, Hove and Sussex, allowing them to see a quality show and work with the professionals involved locally. Indeed the feedback really has shown that quality work of this nature is desired locally, as one audience member of our last production of Much Ado About Nothing stated ""Please do more of this, it will save me a fortune if I don't have to go to London all the time to see Shakespeare done well!""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As well as being a joy, bringing work to churches also has its challenges (part of the reason we need your support). We need to work in an environment that is not set up for theatrical performance and so that requires creative thinking as well as money to ensure that a quality show is produced in particular with regards to elements such as performance space, lighting and sound. As the company and its members have touring experience, setting up productions in places as basic as a field and as exotic as a castle this is something we feel we can embrace and in the end make a virtue of.</p>
<p>As we are going out to churches in a variety of locations some of which are new to us, there is the risk element of ensuring a sizeable audience. Again that is something that support will help as whilst we are already making use of the website and social media to advertise, we will also be using print marketing such as posters and flyers to reach the audiences in their locality as well advertising the show in local newspapers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We know that not everyone has money to spare, but you can still help. Please share the campaign far and wide so we make sure we reach as many people as possible. Thanks to you all, Brighton Shakespeare Company.</div></div>","Brighton Shakespeare Company

<h3>WAKKA WAKKA</h3>
<p>is an extravagantly creative, award-winning puppet troupe.  Our mission is to push the boundaries of the imagination by creating works that are bold, unique and unpredictable. </p>
<p>Since 2001 we have created and produced eight original works of theatre which have toured extensively throughout the US and abroad.  All of Wakka Wakka’s productions have been highly physical, overlapping in a wide range of styles, including grotesque, absurd and clown, incorporating elements such as object manipulation, puppetry, masks and original music.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>MADE IN CHINA</h3>
<p>will open at 59E59 Theaters this January and run for six weeks at the venerable Off-Broadway institution.  This show is our first full puppet musical, and our most ambitious project to date.  We have been blessed to receive substantial grant funding for the project, however we have another $10,000 to raise to complete our production budget.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>YOUR SUPPORT</h3>
<p>will allow us to present a piece of innovative visual theater is artistically rigorous, entertaining and thought-provoking without having to compromise due to financial constraints.  Wakka is upping our game with MADE IN CHINA.  This show has the largest cast we've ever had, and we will be collaborating with more outside artists and designers than ever before.  Simply put, we're going to make the biggest, best show we've ever made, and your funds will directly help to increase the quality of our work.</p> <h3>THE PERKS</h3>
<p>are awesome.  Tickets, cast parties, recordings, tote bags and more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY</h3>
<p>help us?  Our work is worth it.  This show is worth it.  Our unique style of high quality, innovative visual theater examines global issues through a personal lense.  We tell stories that resonate deeply on the individual level while examining universal themes.   And we tell those stories with puppets.  And comedy.  And in this case, songs!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With this campaign, we are looking to help fund the following: </p>
<p>-Non-Profit: We would like to procure funds to establish a non-profit arm for The Callback Company. This will help us with community outreach programs and scholarships for students. </p>
<p>-Programming: The Callback Company would like to continue bringing in quality talent to be utilized for substantial educational opportunities. </p>
<p>-Marketing: Advertising, print marketing, social media and material distributions are all necessary to keep the community informed on all of our upcoming events. Marketing is extremely important to continue to the drive of community outreach. </p>
<p>-Operations: As our memberships continue to grow, there are many financial needs associated with the day to day processes of running a business. These include, but are not limited to: website hosting, legal, tax and insurance fees, venue and travel costs and conference exhibitor fees. </p>
<p>-Home Base: The Callback Company was established as an internet based company that travels wherever needs need to be met. We plan to continue to travel to any areas that show interest in our services, but we would really love to establish a home base. That means finding a space to call our own where we can coach, host masterclasses and seminars and have performances. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are so many fantastic arts programs and studios sprouting up all across Georgia. This growth is encouraging and we are excited to see the passion for the arts grow. Our endeavors are different, however. We do not focus on or produce performances. We strictly focus on the art of auditioning. The ""job"" of any musical theatre/theatre performer is to audition. Our goal is to reinforce the training these students are already receiving from their high schools and college programs by providing individualized audition training to meet their specific needs. This specialized audition training prepares young people not only for opportunities on the stage, but for real life situations where confidence and good communication skills will lead to their success. You only get one first impression. Whether that is in the audition room or a job interview- your success comes down to confidence and preparation. Clients of The Callback Company accomplish both. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While the purpose of this campaign is to spear head a fundraising effort, the most important objective is to raise awareness for The Callback Company and the educational services we provide. Here are some ways you can contribute: </p>
<p>-Spread the news! Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter and Instagram and share our publicity through social media and personal email. Word of mouth is extremely important.</p>
<p>-Sponsor student memberships and/or individual fees towards al a carte events. </p>
<p>-Sponsor an event! Whether it be a Cabaret or a Broadway/Professional Masterclass, we are always looking for partnerships to further our educational programs. </p>
<p>-Invite us to your arts community or school! We are always willing to team up with other arts programs to provide heightened theatre experiences. </p>
<p>-Consider matching the funds we already raise through this campaign. </p>

<h3>What folks are saying: </h3>
<p>Boe Wank (NYC) Dance captain; Anything Goes, National Tour: <br/>""The Callback Company is so important because not everyone gets the opportunities a showcase or master classes can give you. Exposure to life outside of a university wall and to one of the world's most competitive markets is priceless, and I am so happy to see a company that brings the industry to the students and the students to the city.  I think the Callback Company is on its way to becoming a major asset to students who want to push themselves beyond the opportunities they are given. It's the same hunger you possess to choose theatre in the first place, and it's the same drive that will get you to pound the pavement and keep waking up every day to more and more chances to make your dreams real. It all boils down to passion, preparation, and work. ""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mary Brehl (Parent of a Callback Company member)</p>
<p>""The Callback Company has done wonders to boost my daughters confidence as she prepares to participate in high school productions. As a rising 9th grader, she has grown more over the last several months under the direction and guidance of this program than she has in the last 3 years participating in various musicals and productions. They really help students polish their talent so that they are presenting the best version of themselves in an audition situation.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christian Gates (College Student) </p>
<p>""After spending this weekend with this amazing company all I want to do is spend another weekend here. I learned so much in such a short amount of time and my confidence in myself has definitely been boosted. For the first time in a long time, thanks to this company, I finally feel like I have what it takes. Thank you Callback Company for the amazing experience.""</p>

The Impact
With this campaign, we are looking to help fund the following: 
-Non-Profit: We would like to procure funds to establish a non-profit arm for The Callback Company. This will help us with community outreach programs and scholarships for students. 
-Programming: The Callback Company would like to continue bringing in quality talent to be utilized for substantial educational opportunities. 
-Marketing: Advertising, print marketing, social media and material distributions are all necessary to keep the community informed on all of our upcoming events. Marketing is extremely important to continue to the drive of community outreach. 
-Operations: As our memberships continue to grow, there are many financial needs associated with the day to day processes of running a business. These include, but are not limited to: website hosting, legal, tax and insurance fees, venue and travel costs and conference exhibitor fees. 
-Home Base: The Callback Company was established as an internet based company that travels wherever needs need to be met. We plan to continue to travel to any areas that show interest in our services, but we would really love to establish a home base. That means finding a space to call our own where we can coach, host masterclasses and seminars and have performances. 

Risks & Challenges
There are so many fantastic arts programs and studios sprouting up all across Georgia. This growth is encouraging and we are excited to see the passion for the arts grow. Our endeavors are different, however. We do not focus on or produce performances. We strictly focus on the art of auditioning. The ""job"" of any musical theatre/theatre performer is to audition. Our goal is to reinforce the training these students are already receiving from their high schools and college programs by providing individualized audition training to meet their specific needs. This specialized audition training prepares young people not only for opportunities on the stage, but for real life situations where confidence and good communication skills will lead to their success. You only get one first impression. Whether that is in the audition room or a job interview- your success comes down to confidence and preparation. Clients of The Callback Company accomplish both. 

Other Ways You Can Help
While the purpose of this campaign is to spear head a fundraising effort, the most important objective is to raise awareness for The Callback Company and the educational services we provide. Here are some ways you can contribute: 
-Spread the news! Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter and Instagram and share our publicity through social media and personal email. Word of mouth is extremely important.
-Sponsor student memberships and/or individual fees towards al a carte events. 
-Sponsor an event! Whether it be a Cabaret or a Broadway/Professional Masterclass, we are always looking for partnerships to further our educational programs. 
-Invite us to your arts community or school! We are always willing to team up with other arts programs to provide heightened theatre experiences. 
-Consider matching the funds we already raise through this campaign.

What folks are saying: 
Boe Wank (NYC) Dance captain; Anything Goes, National Tour: ""The Callback Company is so important because not everyone gets the opportunities a showcase or master classes can give you. Exposure to life outside of a university wall and to one of the world's most competitive markets is priceless, and I am so happy to see a company that brings the industry to the students and the students to the city.  I think the Callback Company is on its way to becoming a major asset to students who want to push themselves beyond the opportunities they are given. It's the same hunger you possess to choose theatre in the first place, and it's the same drive that will get you to pound the pavement and keep waking up every day to more and more chances to make your dreams real. It all boils down to passion, preparation, and work. ""
 
Mary Brehl (Parent of a Callback Company member)
""The Callback Company has done wonders to boost my daughters confidence as she prepares to participate in high school productions. As a rising 9th grader, she has grown more over the last several months under the direction and guidance of this program than she has in the last 3 years participating in various musicals and productions. They really help students polish their talent so that they are presenting the best version of themselves in an audition situation.""
 
Christian Gates (College Student) 
""After spending this weekend with this amazing company all I want to do is spend another weekend here. I learned so much in such a short amount of time and my confidence in myself has definitely been boosted. For the first time in a long time, thanks to this company, I finally feel like I have what it takes. Thank you Callback Company for the amazing experience.""

<p>My name is Tara Cassone.  I am the owner of La Vita Bella Dance Studio in Guanajuato, Mexico. I have been dancing my whole life. I majored in dance in high school and college. I have been trained by champions from around the word and am certified with high honors in 4 different ballroom styles. I have competed in and won numerous competitions as an amateur and a professional over the span of 16 years. Long story short, dancing is my life. </p>
<p>7 years ago, I moved from Minnesota to Mexico, and 3 years ago <i>teaching </i>dance became my life. I am equally as passionate about teaching as I am about dancing. In particular, teaching young people and knowing that they have everything it takes to become champions.</p>
<p>Last October, after only 6 months of training Arturo (age 22) and Andrea (age 10), became State Champions, placing higher than people with years of experience, and in Andrea's case, people who were twice her age. Arturo went on to win two National Competitions in the following months.</p>
<p>After 7 months of training, Belen (age 26) and Fernando (age 22) were National Semi-Finalists, and received many positive comments on their dancing from teachers and professionals.</p>
<p>The only difference between my students and me is <i>opportunity</i>.</p>
<p>With $10,000, I will be able dedicate a sufficient amount of time to their training to accelerate their advancement. I will help them attain visas and passports and cover travel expenses, giving them more opportunities to compete in Mexico and internationally.</p>
<p>All of my students have told me in their own words how much dancing has improved and changed their lives. But there are many things they can't say, things I see expressed on their faces or in their bodies. I see their confidence and self-worth grow with every step, I see how happy and fulfilled they are when they finish class. These intangible, precious moments are some of the most valuable experiences I have had. Your donation will allow these young people to continue to follow their dreams and surpass their own expectations in dancing and in life. </p>
<p>ANY size donation is accepted. Your kindness is received with gratitude and love and a commitment to quality of dancing and quality of life.
