<p class=""pasbody"">Since 1946, Pine Canyon Camp has changed lives, serving youth, families and special needs groups.  From May 8 through June 25, 2011, the Horseshoe 2 Fire ravaged 80% of the incomparable Chiricahua Mountains (222,954 acres), destroying some of the most unique vegetation and ecosystems in the world. </p>
<p class=""pasbody"">In the middle of this fire area lies the once active Pine Canyon Camp and Retreat Center.  The 15 acre Camp area (leased National Forest land) was mostly untouched by fire; the buildings were saved from fire damage by the firefighters (thank you!!!).  However, the electrical lines serving the cabins were damaged by the fire.  This electrical service is important to keep our youth safe during the evening and night hours as they travel from the cabins to the restrooms.</p>
<p class=""pasbody"">We need your help.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Priorities include: replacing the electrical service to the cabins.  We have had on the plans to put the electrical underground to make it safe from fire and weather damage.  Now that we MUST replace this service, we plan on “doing it right” and burying the lines.</p>
<p>We are requesting funding to pay for the rental of heavy equipment needed to dig the trenches, as well as the electrical supplies and materials.  We have received a bid of $20,000 from a reputable electrical contractor.  However, we have qualified volunteers that can do the majority of the work, reducing our costs in half.</p>

<p>     One day I spied a pretty little girl about 8 or 9 years old, named Diane*, sitting at a picnic table.  I sat down across from her and casually asked her how her day was going.  She told me how fun it was in Arts &amp; Crafts that morning.  I asked her if she made any new friends this week. She told me about a couple of the girls in her cabin and her counselor.  Somewhere in our discussion she told me that she had been recently adopted.  She told me about how she and her brother used to be homeless, living on the streets with their mother.  Her mother’s “medication” was just too expensive to afford a house to live in.  Sometimes, she said, they would sneak into the back door of her grandma’s house and grandma would feed them. They were really hungry! </p>
<p>     At Camp she didn’t have to worry about being hungry (mmm . . . it was good!), she didn’t have to worry about where she was going to sleep, AND she could make friends and have fun! She was like everyone else when she was at Camp; she didn’t have to worry about <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">any</span>thing when she was at Camp except just being a kid!</p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Camp Hope</span></p>
<p>     I met Ed*, an autistic 50+ year old man during our camp for developmentally disabled adults, Camp Hope.  The first year I met him, he spent the entire week on the porch at the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">one</span> smoking spot available, chain-smoking.  He didn’t look at anyone and he didn’t speak to anyone.  He only came off the porch to eat and to go to bed.  Ed’s group home and Camp counselors told me that he looked forward to his week at Camp all year long.  By his third year, he was off that porch, occasionally participating.  By his fifth year, he was holding full conversations, maintaining eye contact, and participating joyfully in most of the Camp activities.</p>
<p>     In a few short years Ed went from an uncommunicative, closed off individual to a cheerful, talkative, happy man and a joy to be around.  He was helpful to his fellow campers and when he arrived home, he was an active member of his group home and community.</p>

<p>     On the last evening at the closing Campfire for our Strength For the Journey retreat (for HIV+/AIDS adults and their caregivers), Jane* stood up to speak.  What she said astounded us all.  She was 38 years old, had grown up on the streets and, like her mother, prostituted herself in order to buy her next high.  She ended up in jail for prostitution; while there she learned she was HIV+.</p>
<p>     That evening she told us “I thank God for giving me this disease.”  We all gasped.  “Because of this disease, I got to come to this retreat – I’ve never been to a place like this.  What I learned here is that I get to actually <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">live</span> whatever life I have left, instead of always looking for my next high, then being too drugged up to actually live.”</p>
<p>     Jane has since married her long-time boyfriend and has worked to regain her health, physically and emotionally.  It hasn’t been easy, but she continues to work towards her goal, with the help her friends she made at Camp.</p>

The Texas Wellness Initiative was thought up and created by a few nursing students (with a few mass communications majors sprinkled in) in the hopes of improving rural community health education and to provide nursing students with a way to interact directly with these communities.

The Impact
Belton is surrounded by many of Central Texas's small rural towns, many of which have poor access to medical care. The Texas Wellness Initiative is in a prime location to provide these communities with free health screenings, health fairs, and educational seminars to adults and children. These screenings, fairs, and seminars would be given by medical/nursing students and professionals currently working or attending school in the Central Texas area.
In addition to bettering the health awareness of the community, The Texas Wellness Initiative would also provide nursing students with an opportunity to become more effective, more professional, and more caring nurses at the end of their collegiate career though one-on-one interactions with individuals from these communities.
We here at The Texas Wellness Initiative are starting off local with the major aspiration of one day providing community health education nationwide.

What We Need
The Texas Wellness Initiative is just getting started. We need a minimum of $600 dollars to submit our application for incorporation to the state of Texas and to apply for non-profit status. Once that has been filed, individuals who donate will be able to make tax-deductible donations to our organization, along with other perks (like discounted web hosting).
The remainder of the amount is to help us get started with necessary administrative functions like tax filings, web hosting, health screening kits, publications, venue rental, and advertisements.
Since many of us at The Texas Wellness Initiative are going on to become professional nurses, we have a strong desire to uphold the tradition our profession has established as being considered the most honest and ethical out there (for the past twelve years). In order to maintain that standard, The Texas Wellness Initiative will strive to be open and transparent with our goals and operations. We want you to know where your money is going, so once our website is up and running we will be posting regular financial updates to specifically show how your donations were used to implement our programs and mission.

<h3>What Children Learn at Youthtube</h3>
<p>At Youthtube Academy we encourage the creativity of young people to help kids learn fundamental life skills in an immersive and interactive way. Inspired by his own journey through depression and his inability to speak up when he needed to most, Warren Inspire Ryan, an award-winning international speaker, has made it his life purpose to empower young people and to give them a voice so that the 1 in 9 children who have a mental health disorder in the UK do not have to suffer or feel alone.</p>
<p>We know that kids are more likely to learn through play-like activities which is why we use YouTube as a tool to keep kids interested while teaching them skills like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotional intelligence and how they can be better communicators because we want kids to have the skills they need to overcome any challenges that they may face in life.</li>
<li>Leadership skills that help kids to be great role models and inspire other young people.</li>
<li>Business skills because we want kids to have a career that the love and a life they want to live!</li>
<li>It’s important that kids understand what information is safe to share online which is why we teach them about internet safety. We also show kids that how they act online should be the same as how they treat people in person and that cyberbullying is never ok.</li>
<li>The importance of giving back to those less fortunate with each YouTuber sponsoring a charity that is close to their heart.</li>
</ul>
<p>We teach young people everything that they need to thrive in life and surround them with a supportive community of young inspiring people so they can become the next generation of leaders.</p>

</p><p><strong>What is EDU Gaming?</strong></p>
<p>EDU Gaming CIC is an e-learning community interest company.
It is our mission to explore the educational value of video games and
technology to improve the accessibility and development of e-learning
resources. We are creating the first platform that provides a space for gamers,
students and educators to meet on equal footing and share their ideas and
experiences.</p><p>It's free to join with many free features available. Sign up today at </p><p><a href=""http://www.edu-gaming.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.edu-gaming.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why Video Games?</strong></p>
<p>Video games have come on a long way since the days of Pong
and Mario, and it’s not all about Call of Duty or Battlefield. Today video
games cover a wide array of subjects and with indie developers constantly
joining the market there seems to be no end to the diversity. As more topics
are covered we consistently see overlapping trends between the subjects taught
in schools and the themes of video games and with this overlap comes an
opportunity for application. In addition, we are seeing a paradigm shift in
education that moves away from simple information delivery and conditioning,
and towards guided experience. In this regard videos games may certainly play a
key role.</p>
<p><strong>Do You Really Think Gamers Have a Role in the Future of
Education?</strong></p>
<p>The short answer is yes! We understand educators are
specialists in teaching but there are many educators who are not digital
natives or, at least, are less familiar with available technology and software
compared with their students. Obviously this can pose a problem with e-learning.</p>
<p>Gamers, on the other hand, are experts at video games. With
many putting in hours that might cause a blush. These individuals are some of
the best contenders for determining the pros and cons of a video game and its
worth remembering that gamers are people too, including some students and
educators. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1253598/files/20150227062109-asteroid-mining.png?1425046869"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Many gamers have also gone on to develop sophisticated skills out of
a passion for gaming including programming, website development and video
production… All sought-after skills in today’s job market. </p>
<p>Developing a space where interested gamers, students and
educators can meet to share their experiences seems to be the best way in
developing the application of e-learning. 
</p>
<p><strong>Our Platform</strong></p>
<p>EDU Gaming is creating a versatile platform that
incorporates social media and an online magazine to share ideas about
game-based learning, both ours and yours. We are also developing various

<p><strong>It’s All for You!</strong></p>
<p>Being a community interest company (CIC) means that EDU
Gaming is all about you. A CIC is a form of social enterprise and effectively
puts us half way between being a charity and commercial entity. We can make a
profit but we are independently regulated to ensure that the majority of that
profit is reinvested in a manner that is seen to be serving our community. In
addition, all community interest companies are also subject to an asset lock which
means they are required to hand over any remaining assets to another asset
locked body such as a charity or other CIC if the company dissolves. This gives
you the peace of mind of knowing that if you support EDU Gaming the money you
invest in us will be reinvested in you and should we ever fail in our mission,
your investment will go on to support another worthy cause.  </p>
<p><strong>Why Choose Us?</strong></p>
<p>Since the formation of EDU Gaming we have been working
tirelessly to network with various companies throughout the gaming industry
such as Multiplay, Paradox Interactive, Creative Assembly, TeacherGaming LLC,
Squad, and many more, as well as numerous educators across the UK and around
the world. This puts us in a unique position to bring individuals together to
look at new and exciting projects in the development of e-learning. What’s
more, we give you the opportunity to get involved as well! </p>
<p><strong>We Need Your Support</strong></p>
<p>EDU Gaming CIC has come on a long way in the past 12 months
but we are still a young company. A lot of development has taken place behind
the scenes with the production of our resources and software as well as the
huge amount of research exploring game-based learning. However, constructive
feedback has suggested that the project is suffering because our website is not
as visually appealing as it could be. For this reason we have started the first
EDU Gaming crowd funding campaign to improve the website and build a platform
you can be proud of. We have come this far on very limited finances and a lot
of dedication… Imagine what we could achieve together with your support.</p>
<p><strong>Where Will The Money Go?</strong></p>
<p>The money raised from this crowd funding campaign will be
used to redesign the EDU Gaming website and improve its look and functionality.
It will also be used to complete the development and integration of our newest
software including our virtual learning environment and e-sports package into
the EDU Gaming platform for a seamless user experience. If we are fortunate
enough to exceed our target then we will be looking to expand the EDU Gaming
team with more community developers and researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways To Help</strong></p>

<div><b>I have been working with the PTA and they agreed to use the money for the tables once the money is rasied</b></div>And that's all there is to it.</div></div>","Why This Cause
I chose Dixie Canyon Elementary School to do my activism project.  An activism project is a project I am assigned as part of my Civics Academy curriculum at Millikan Middle School.  My little brother currently goes to Dixie and I went there in elementary school to.  For these reasons Dixie is very close to my heart.

What I Will Get & What We Need 


These are the things I need to achieve my goal:  One table with benches with a built in umbrella.
At least $500 to present to the PTA at Dixie. 
If I get this or more, the PTA will match the amount to help buy the table.



The Impact
 One I reach my goal, these are some of the things that kindergarteners will get.  Benches with tables to sit and eat lunch. A built in umbrella on the table for improved shade while eating. Overall happy kids during the day.


    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot contribute to my project, there are other ways you can help.  Spread the word about my project to others you know. Share it to your social media for the world to see.

<h3>About Manana Youth Center and the Manana Animation Studio</h3>
<p>The <strong>Manana Animation Studio</strong> is an award-winning studio that provides youth with high-quality training in the production of animated films and cartoons. It is part of <a href=""http://www.mananayouth.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Manana Youth Center</strong></a>, a cutting-edge multimedia training organization that works to develop the intellectual and creative talents of young people between the ages of 7-16 in Armenia. The Manana Youth Center was founded in 1995, and seeks to create an environment for the overall creative and intellectual development of children. Students are educated as artists and critical thinkers, and through classes at Manana Youth Center, they become socially minded citizens speaking for their generation. </p>
<h3>The Sand Animals film series</h3>
<p>The Sand Animals project embodies Manana Youth Center’s mission of providing youth with quality educational programming in art, new media and technology.<span><br/></span></p>
<p><strong>The Sand Animals</strong> has two primary goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Produce a visually engaging education tool to teach children the Armenian alphabet.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Teach Manana Youth Center’s students to create animated films.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Manana’s animation students will storyboard each Sand Animals episode, create the animations, and edit the short films. Through this process, they will become adept at sand animation techniques. Each episode will be around 40 seconds, and will introduce children to a different letter of the Armenian alphabet and to different kinds of animals.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Manana Animation Studio students are currently working on the first episode, which introduces viewers to the letter "" Ա ա "" (A a) of the Armenian alphabet, and to the animal ""ԱՐՋ"" (""Arj"", which means ""bear""). </p>

<h2>EN GROS</h2>
<p>Je suis accompagnante en matière de Santé et de Bien-être. J'ai une formation en herboristerie, en nutrition et une spécialisation en soins énergétiques intuitifs. En approfondissant personnellement dans ces directions, j'ai réalisé que plusieurs facteurs de santé méritaient à être revisités, ce qui m'a permis d'élaborer des <strong>outils simples et efficaces pour en venir à trouver l'équilibre et le confort dans notre vie de tous les jours.</strong> Ces dernières années, je me suis penchée sur les aspects plus essentiels de la vie, en expérimentant la maternité à travers l'accueil de mes deux  enfants, mais aussi en reconnectant avec ma vraie nature, cheminement qui m'a apporté plusieurs enseignements précieux.  </p>
<p>Je tiens à rédiger un ouvrage où je pourrai transmettre tout ce savoir qui m'habite de manière à ce que le plus de personnes possibles puissent en bénéficier et <strong>éventuellement jouir d'un état de bien-être et de santé supérieure, voir permanent</strong>. Mon intention première est d'offrir un ouvrage lumineux, imagé et coloré, bienveillant, agréable et inspirant où le lecteur sera amené à considérer les ""solutions"" plutôt que les aspects nocifs et dégradants de notre environnement dénaturé, tout en étant informé des facteurs de risques de nos habitudes modernes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The project</h2>
<p><em>I'm a catalyst of wealth and well-being. I have a background in herbalism, nutrition, and am an intuitive healer. Deepening in these directions, I realized that many health factors deserve to be revisited, which has allowed me to develop simples and effectives tools to maintain balance and comfort in our daily lives. In recent years, I have looked at the most essentials aspects of life, experiencing motherhood through the welcoming of my two children, but also reconnecting with my true nature, journey that has brought me many valuable lessons.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to write a book where I can pass on all the knowledge that live in me so that as many people as possible can benefit and possibly enjoy a state of well-being and greater health, see permanent. My first intention is to provide an illuminated book, colorful, pleasant and inspiring where I'll consider the ""solutions"" rather than harmful and degrading aspects of our unnatural environment, while being aware of factors risks of our modern habits.</em></p>
<h3>Mon besoin en financement</h3>
<p>Toute contribution financière à l'égard de cette merveilleuse ambition que je porte m'aidera à supporter à mon tour tous ceux qui participeront de leurs talents ou services à la naissance de ce livre (révision (1500$?), impression (4000$?!, graphisme (2000$?), promotion/ site internet monétisé (3000$?) et autres imprévus ou ambition (traduction vers l'anglais?). Comme vous pouvez le constater mon besoin dépasse largement les 5000$ demandés, mais étrangement, indiegogo prend seulement 4% du financement reçu si  nous atteignons notre objectif plutôt que 9% si nous ne l'atteignons pas. J'estime que, tout comme moi, il vous est plutôt préférable que votre financement bénéficie le plus possible au projet.</p>
<p><strong>Merci infiniment, j'éprouve une extrême reconnaissance pour votre soutient et votre élan de générosité. Votre apport est extrêmement encourageant et <strong>me propulse vers la réalisation de mon projet.</strong></strong></p>
<p>Je tiens profondément à ce projet, c'est un peu un appel du coeur, un passage obligé. <strong>J'estime que l'être humain à le droit de jouir d'un bient-être profond et d'être sain de la tête au pied</strong> et je m'engage à mettre à sa portée tous les outils efficaces que je connais en la matière. <strong>Trop de gens souffrent d'un mal être profond ou d'une condition physique limitative alors qu'il pourrait en être autrement.</strong> J'offre des séances d'accompagnement desquels j'ai reçu beaucoup de commentaires positifs. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><em>My need for funding</em></h2>
<p><em>Any financial contribution towards this wonderful ambition I have will help me to support at my turn all those involved for their talents and services to the birth of this book (review ($ 1500?), Printing ($ 4,000? !, graphics ($ 2000?) Promotion / website monetized ($ 3000?) and other unforeseen or ambition (translation into English?). As you can see my need well over $ 5,000 requested, but strangely, INDIEGOGO takes only 4% of the funding received if we reach our goal rather than 9% if we do not reach. I prefer that your financial support benefits as much as possible the project.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Thank you so much, I feel extreme gratitude for your support and your generosity. Your input is extremely encouraging and propuls me to my goal.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>I am deeply attacht to this project, it is a bit of a calling, a must. <strong>I believe that the human being has the right to enjoy a deep wellbeing and be healthy from head to foot,</strong> and I am committed to share all effective tools that I know in this area. <strong>Too many people suffer from a deep malaise or a limiting physical condition when it could be otherwise.</strong> I offer coaching sessions where I received a lot of positive feedback.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">LE PROJET DÉVOILÉ</strong></p>
<p>Au fil du temps, j'ai réalisé que nous avions une <strong>idée limitée des facteurs responsables de la santé et que notre façon de gérer celle-ci n'amène pas les résultats espérés, justement parce qu'elle comporte certaines lacunes.</strong> Par exemple, au niveau scientifique, il semblerait que nous n'ayons pas encore eu le temps de faire une mise à jour par rapport à <strong>des donnés très probantes</strong> qui redéfinissent le rôle des micro-organismes si craints, l'importance de l'intégrité de nos muqueuses intestinales ou encore l'impact de nos habitudes de vie modernes, de notre alimentation dénaturée, des polluants environnementaux, pesticides, produits ménagers, etc. </p>
<p>Et puis comme, à la base <strong>tout est énergie</strong>, j'aimerais aborder notre <strong>vitalité</strong> d'un point de vue énergétique en parlant de <strong>Taux vibratoire</strong> et de <strong>médecine quantique</strong>. Donc, dans cet ouvrage, à partir de mes connaissances en énergétique, médecine intuitive, nutrition, médecines naturelles et modernes, chinoise, ayurvédique, physique quantique, etc, j'aborderai sous un angle plus global (et marginal?) les principes fondamentaux de la Santé.</p>
<p><strong>Voici une idée première des sujets abordés:</strong>  le respect de notre écosystème individuel, la nutrition, la maladie, le système immunitaire et son fonctionnement, les micro-organismes, la flore bactérienne, l'intégrité des muqueuses, Pasteur vs Béchamp, La tonification du terrain vs la vaccination, Les maladies émergentes débilitantes, les maladies infantiles, l'amour et la réalisation de Soi, vivre à partir de sa vraie nature, l'énergétique, le taux vibratoire, les blocages énergétiques, l'impact des pensées négatives et de la visualisation, les alternatives naturelles et la médecine moderne, la respiration, la tonification de son terrain et la purification saine de celui-ci, l'impact des polluants environnementaux et des métaux lourds, et bien davantage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><em>THE PROJECT REVEALED</em></h2>
<p><em>Over time, I realized that we had a limited understanding of the factors responsibles for health and how we manage it does not bring the desired results, just because it has some shortcomings. For example, at a scientific level, it seems that we have not yet had time to do an update with respectfull data that redefine the role of micro-organisms so feared, the importance of integrity of our intestinal mucosa or the impact of our habits of this modern life, our unnatural diet, environmental pollutants, pesticides, household products, etc..</em></p>
<p><em>And as at the basis everything is energy, I would like to address our vitality from the point of view of energy talking vibratory rate and quantum medicine. So in this book, from my knowledge of energy, intuitive medicine, nutrition, natural and modern medicine, Chinese, Ayurvedic, quantum physics, etc., I will discuss in a more global perspective (and marginal?) The fundamental principles of Health.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Here is a first idea of the topics:</strong> respect for our individual ecosystem, nutrition, diseases, the immune system and its operation, microorganisms, bacterial flora, mucosal integrity, Pastor vs. Béchamp, The toning field vs. vaccination, debilitating emerging diseases, childhood diseases, love and self-realization, living from our true nature, energy, the vibratory rate, energy blockages, the impact of negative thinking and visualization, natural alternatives, modern medicine, breathing, toning his organism and healthy cleansing of it, the impact of environmental pollutants and heavy metals, and more.</em></p>

EN GROS
Je suis accompagnante en matière de Santé et de Bien-être. J'ai une formation en herboristerie, en nutrition et une spécialisation en soins énergétiques intuitifs. En approfondissant personnellement dans ces directions, j'ai réalisé que plusieurs facteurs de santé méritaient à être revisités, ce qui m'a permis d'élaborer des outils simples et efficaces pour en venir à trouver l'équilibre et le confort dans notre vie de tous les jours. Ces dernières années, je me suis penchée sur les aspects plus essentiels de la vie, en expérimentant la maternité à travers l'accueil de mes deux  enfants, mais aussi en reconnectant avec ma vraie nature, cheminement qui m'a apporté plusieurs enseignements précieux.  
Je tiens à rédiger un ouvrage où je pourrai transmettre tout ce savoir qui m'habite de manière à ce que le plus de personnes possibles puissent en bénéficier et éventuellement jouir d'un état de bien-être et de santé supérieure, voir permanent. Mon intention première est d'offrir un ouvrage lumineux, imagé et coloré, bienveillant, agréable et inspirant où le lecteur sera amené à considérer les ""solutions"" plutôt que les aspects nocifs et dégradants de notre environnement dénaturé, tout en étant informé des facteurs de risques de nos habitudes modernes.
 
The project
I'm a catalyst of wealth and well-being. I have a background in herbalism, nutrition, and am an intuitive healer. Deepening in these directions, I realized that many health factors deserve to be revisited, which has allowed me to develop simples and effectives tools to maintain balance and comfort in our daily lives. In recent years, I have looked at the most essentials aspects of life, experiencing motherhood through the welcoming of my two children, but also reconnecting with my true nature, journey that has brought me many valuable lessons.
I want to write a book where I can pass on all the knowledge that live in me so that as many people as possible can benefit and possibly enjoy a state of well-being and greater health, see permanent. My first intention is to provide an illuminated book, colorful, pleasant and inspiring where I'll consider the ""solutions"" rather than harmful and degrading aspects of our unnatural environment, while being aware of factors risks of our modern habits.
Mon besoin en financement
Toute contribution financière à l'égard de cette merveilleuse ambition que je porte m'aidera à supporter à mon tour tous ceux qui participeront de leurs talents ou services à la naissance de ce livre (révision (1500$?), impression (4000$?!, graphisme (2000$?), promotion/ site internet monétisé (3000$?) et autres imprévus ou ambition (traduction vers l'anglais?). Comme vous pouvez le constater mon besoin dépasse largement les 5000$ demandés, mais étrangement, indiegogo prend seulement 4% du financement reçu si  nous atteignons notre objectif plutôt que 9% si nous ne l'atteignons pas. J'estime que, tout comme moi, il vous est plutôt préférable que votre financement bénéficie le plus possible au projet.
Merci infiniment, j'éprouve une extrême reconnaissance pour votre soutient et votre élan de générosité. Votre apport est extrêmement encourageant et me propulse vers la réalisation de mon projet.
Je tiens profondément à ce projet, c'est un peu un appel du coeur, un passage obligé. J'estime que l'être humain à le droit de jouir d'un bient-être profond et d'être sain de la tête au pied et je m'engage à mettre à sa portée tous les outils efficaces que je connais en la matière. Trop de gens souffrent d'un mal être profond ou d'une condition physique limitative alors qu'il pourrait en être autrement. J'offre des séances d'accompagnement desquels j'ai reçu beaucoup de commentaires positifs. 
 
My need for funding
Any financial contribution towards this wonderful ambition I have will help me to support at my turn all those involved for their talents and services to the birth of this book (review ($ 1500?), Printing ($ 4,000? !, graphics ($ 2000?) Promotion / website monetized ($ 3000?) and other unforeseen or ambition (translation into English?). As you can see my need well over $ 5,000 requested, but strangely, INDIEGOGO takes only 4% of the funding received if we reach our goal rather than 9% if we do not reach. I prefer that your financial support benefits as much as possible the project.
Thank you so much, I feel extreme gratitude for your support and your generosity. Your input is extremely encouraging and propuls me to my goal.
I am deeply attacht to this project, it is a bit of a calling, a must. I believe that the human being has the right to enjoy a deep wellbeing and be healthy from head to foot, and I am committed to share all effective tools that I know in this area. Too many people suffer from a deep malaise or a limiting physical condition when it could be otherwise. I offer coaching sessions where I received a lot of positive feedback.
 
LE PROJET DÉVOILÉ
Au fil du temps, j'ai réalisé que nous avions une idée limitée des facteurs responsables de la santé et que notre façon de gérer celle-ci n'amène pas les résultats espérés, justement parce qu'elle comporte certaines lacunes. Par exemple, au niveau scientifique, il semblerait que nous n'ayons pas encore eu le temps de faire une mise à jour par rapport à des donnés très probantes qui redéfinissent le rôle des micro-organismes si craints, l'importance de l'intégrité de nos muqueuses intestinales ou encore l'impact de nos habitudes de vie modernes, de notre alimentation dénaturée, des polluants environnementaux, pesticides, produits ménagers, etc. 
Et puis comme, à la base tout est énergie, j'aimerais aborder notre vitalité d'un point de vue énergétique en parlant de Taux vibratoire et de médecine quantique. Donc, dans cet ouvrage, à partir de mes connaissances en énergétique, médecine intuitive, nutrition, médecines naturelles et modernes, chinoise, ayurvédique, physique quantique, etc, j'aborderai sous un angle plus global (et marginal?) les principes fondamentaux de la Santé.
Voici une idée première des sujets abordés:  le respect de notre écosystème individuel, la nutrition, la maladie, le système immunitaire et son fonctionnement, les micro-organismes, la flore bactérienne, l'intégrité des muqueuses, Pasteur vs Béchamp, La tonification du terrain vs la vaccination, Les maladies émergentes débilitantes, les maladies infantiles, l'amour et la réalisation de Soi, vivre à partir de sa vraie nature, l'énergétique, le taux vibratoire, les blocages énergétiques, l'impact des pensées négatives et de la visualisation, les alternatives naturelles et la médecine moderne, la respiration, la tonification de son terrain et la purification saine de celui-ci, l'impact des polluants environnementaux et des métaux lourds, et bien davantage.
 
THE PROJECT REVEALED
Over time, I realized that we had a limited understanding of the factors responsibles for health and how we manage it does not bring the desired results, just because it has some shortcomings. For example, at a scientific level, it seems that we have not yet had time to do an update with respectfull data that redefine the role of micro-organisms so feared, the importance of integrity of our intestinal mucosa or the impact of our habits of this modern life, our unnatural diet, environmental pollutants, pesticides, household products, etc..
And as at the basis everything is energy, I would like to address our vitality from the point of view of energy talking vibratory rate and quantum medicine. So in this book, from my knowledge of energy, intuitive medicine, nutrition, natural and modern medicine, Chinese, Ayurvedic, quantum physics, etc., I will discuss in a more global perspective (and marginal?) The fundamental principles of Health.
Here is a first idea of the topics: respect for our individual ecosystem, nutrition, diseases, the immune system and its operation, microorganisms, bacterial flora, mucosal integrity, Pastor vs. Béchamp, The toning field vs. vaccination, debilitating emerging diseases, childhood diseases, love and self-realization, living from our true nature, energy, the vibratory rate, energy blockages, the impact of negative thinking and visualization, natural alternatives, modern medicine, breathing, toning his organism and healthy cleansing of it, the impact of environmental pollutants and heavy metals, and more.
 
LES À CÔTÉ
Le Guide Alimentaire Vivifiant

J'ai réalisé au printemps 2012 une Conférence-Gourmande en lien avec un Guide alimentaire Vivifiant (que j'ai moi-même conçu et que je souhaite distribuer à large échelle éventuellement), celui-ci est un résumé concis du type d'alimentation que nous devrions prôner, en accord avec notre nature, pour nous sentir Vibrants, Vivants, Vivifiés. Un petit tirage (50X) a été effectué de cette première version qui sera modifié de manière à être intégré avec mon Livre.
 
Les conférences
Je souhaite monter une série de conférences WEB en lien avec le livre. Pour l'instant, j'ai l'idée d'en monter 4 qui aborderaient les sujets suivants : 
* De l'intégrité des muqueuses (impact des irritants, gluten et produits laitiers)
* L'alimentation vivifiante (en lilen avec le Guide)
* Maladies, micro-organismes et système immunitaire
* Se purifier sainement et naturellement
 
Le CD et Le coffre à outil
Notez que les investisseurs de plus de 200$ recevront un CD tout spécialement conçu pour eux contenant toutes les conférences WEB réalisées en lien avec le livre. De plus, les ""choyés"" recevront un coffre à outil interactif et amusant, conçus à partir des donnés du livre.

the African Association of Interior Designers (AAID <a href=""http://www.aaidesign.org),"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.aaidesign.org),</a> I have
a strong passion for empowering others particularly young people and I have
used every resource I can to create platforms to help empower youths and reduce
poverty in Africa.</p>
<p>That passion led me to found a vocation skill school in 2008 to teach Interior
decoration and design (please visit the following links: <a href=""http://www.mavensidd.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mavensidd.com</a>  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/mavensidd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/mavensidd</a> )and today we have
further through a sister school created new courses to include make up
artistry, bead making and wire works, photography etc we have through
partnerships been able to have small training centres in more than 5 locations
across Nigeria and we have started working towards opening training centres in
Ghana and Sierra Leone and the Gambia etc</p>
<p>Since inception nothing has been more important to us than seeing jobless
youths get vocation skills that will help them become self reliant and
employers of labour, it just always brings me so much joy, the level of poverty
in Africa is unbelievably high- in a country like mine where corruption is
record high, poverty levels amid vast natural resources is painful, the minimum
basic income is 100usd per month and only a few can get jobs, the very high
level of youth unemployment has plunged the country into scary levels of
insecurity as youths now find very negative ways of surviving- social ills
stemming from unemployment are worsening by the day.</p>
<p>There are not too many people doing much about empowering youths but we
have made up our minds that we will do all in our power to give young people
the power to make the world better, when they can earn income and make money
then they will help others also, the task is daunting as one of every 4 African
is a Nigerian but we are more than ready to continue to help reduce
unemployment; since inception we have trained 1840 students across Nigeria, 70%
of that number have gone to starting their own businesses, 25% have found
employment in firms and companies that require their new skills and every month
we continue to produce employers of labour but we know we need to do more. Our
graduates earn an average of 950usd monthly and some even more!</p>
<p>Lack of basic infrastructure makes it very expensive indeed to run a
business in Nigeria, as I write this, our school and offices are powered by a
petrol power generating set, we have been on the generator for about 5 hours
now and we will likely do so till close of day, we have to buy expensive petrol
daily; the high cost of running the school ensures that we cannot subsidize
fees to a cost everybody can afford, we need to bring cost down from 468usd
(other schools who teach the same curriculum charge 6250usd); we already give
at least 3 full scholarships every month and we need to do much more; we can
only teach 10 students at a time but if we had a larger space we will take more
unemployed youths and be more sustainable, at the moment we are barely able to
survive, every cash made is re-invested into the school to keep it afloat and
keep helping people; with your contributions we can help put smiles on the
faces of many thousands!</p>
<p>The country has 36 states and we have been able through strategic
partnerships to open small centers in only 8 states, the high cost of
maintaining the campuses at a reduced tuition that many still cannot afford has
turned 5 of the centers into under performers, with your contribution we can
turn that around, we will get bigger spaces and train more young people, we
will be able to give out more scholarships, we will open more centers across
the Country and move ahead to open at least one center in Ghana; our goal is to
be sustainable and your kind contribution can help us achieve that, we can take
youths of crime and social ills, we can help reduce insecurity and even
terrorism by giving youths a means to earn, we must all work together to break
the vicious cycle of poverty and its very ravaging ill effects.</p>
<p>Increased funding will ensure we can publicize more, get bigger spaces
with adequate infrastructure and training equipment, we can now have a much
needed workshop and afford to employ more professionals, with more training
centers and more students we can have sustainable growth and do so much more! </p>
<p>We need you! </p>

small and we can only teach about 10 students per class, we have only 2 classes
and we do not have a much needed workshop; power supply is far from constant in
the Country and we do need a very good power generating set, we need a bigger
library and more equipped library and funds to get teaching aids, material
samples and afford to pay more experienced facilitators and of course we need a
much bigger space. </p>
<p>Please find below a detailed breakdown:</p>
<p>3 year lease for a bigger training facility- <b>$18750</b></p>
<p>Fully equipped Training workshop (to show students how to install
physical building elements)- <b>$28125</b></p>
<p>Teaching Aids and Equipment in 10 locations across the Country- <b>$37,500</b></p>
<p>Power generating set (Diesel engine)- <b>$9375</b></p>
<p>Nationwide Publicity and Marketing- <b>$12,500</b></p>
<p>Total:  <b>$106250</b></p>
<p>Amount to be put down by us:  <b>$21250</b></p>
<p>Total amount needed: <b>$85000 </b></p>
<p>Increased funding will ensure we can give more indigent students full and
partial scholarships, we currently give at least one student a scholarship in
every class of 10, a larger class size will ensure helping more students will
be sustainable.</p>
<p>Though we sincerely hope and believe you are just as passionate as we are
in ensuring that we make our world a better place by reducing poverty and
unemployment and would help us surpass our fund raising goals but if we do not
reach our funding goal we will use the funds raised to get a larger training
facility so we can empower more youths and be more sustainable as a business.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208660/files/20131119043523-Practical_Hands-on_training.jpg?1384864523"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Picture above showing students out on Practicals</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208667/files/20131119043931-65863_299708974974_209721_n.jpg?1384864771"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Picture above showing students out on Practicals<br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208664/files/20131119043752-student_excursion_2.jpg?1384864672"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208671/files/20131119044301-30918_280879874974_5618183_n.jpg?1384864981"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208672/files/20131119044429-DSC04888.JPG?1384865069"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Pictures above showing our students out on excursion <br/><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>

In my family food equaled love and because my family was so loving - I became obese at a very young age. At my peak I was 275 lbs. Growing up ""the nerdy fat kid"" I had no sense what it meant to be healthy and physically active. Over the years dieting turned into supplement abuse and desperation sent me spiraling into an eating disorder that nearly killed me.It took a long time, a lot of research, self-motivation, and willpower to bring out the healthy happy woman I am today.I want to take my experience and get the education I need to help others like me become the amazing people I know everyone can be. This is something I've always wanted to do but because of the high cost it had remained a pipe dream.It wasn't until this past January when I was laid off from my job as a television news producer that I decided it was time to follow my real passion.This campaign is to raise enough money for me to attend the Focus Personal Training Institute - New York's leading facility for those looking to enter the fitness industry.Please know that I have looked into all avenues of funding (i.e. loans and payment plans), but I am not eligible. I have and always been a big supporter of people's projects and dreams.Now I can only hope that karma really exists.What We Need & What You GetI need approximately $18,550 to make this happen.Here is the cost breakdown:- Training Courses: $10,500- Textbooks and training supplies: $898- Registration, COL, ACE exam & campaign fees: $7,150Here are the unique perks I can offer for your donations:

</p><h2><b>My Story</b></h2>
<p>Greetings!  My name is
Michael Carr and I'm a 22 year-old from Alexandria, Virginia.  I am
currently a Teach for America (TFA) corps member in the Hawaii region teaching in an underfunded and poorly resourced school district.
 I teach 8th grade math and science for special education students who
present a wide array of unique challenges and needs to be met.  I
graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) as an honors student with
a B.S. in Economics and a minor in Political Science.  I am currently
getting my Masters Degree in Secondary Education from Johns Hopkins University.
 As a result of all my experiences, both good and bad, I feel that there is a dire need to attract
talent and passion into socially beneficial economic sectors.  I fundamentally
believe that to perpetuate social innovation in our society, we need
the best and brightest in socioeconomic fields.  George Mason University is a leader in educating up and coming social entrepreneurs.  This is a fairly new field
of study with plenty left to explore, and may have the answers to some of
society's most pressing problems.</p><p>  <br/></p><h4><b>What is a social entrepreneur, you ask?  </b></h4><p></p><p>Simply put, it is an individual who has dedicated his/her life to
starting enterprises <b>for the good of all people</b>.  Notable social
entrepreneurs include Sal Khan of The Khan Academy, Blake Mycoskie of TOMS shoes,
Richard Saul Wurman of Ted Talks, and Wendy Kopp of Teach for America. These people are fundamentally improving the way we interact with the world.  One day, with your
support, I will have the opportunity to be amongst their ranks.<br/><br/></p><h2><b>What I Need</b></h2><b>

Please join our effort to raise $140,000 by June 15 to assist 28 eligible couples and individuals adopt children from the United States, Bulgaria, China, Columbia, Honduras, Nicaragua, Philippines, Uganda, and Ukraine. 100% of the monies raised by Salvation International Adoption Charity is used to help build families through adoption.<br/><br/> Founded in 2012 by DANIELLE FLEÉNOR, who also serves as Executive Director, the evolution of Salvation International Adoption Charity is literally a labor of love.  Danielle said, ""A few years back, my husband and I looked into adopting a baby from China.  Realizing it cost $30,000, and we just didn't have $30,000 at the time, I ended up thinking if it was hard for me to find that kind of money, it must be hard for others too.  I thought, I could start a clothing line and the money I raised I will just give away.  And that is how Salvation International began.”<br/><br/>Bringing together a group of friends including ARLENE BELL, Director of Donations, Marketing and Event Coordination, SANDY KORDICK, Director of Fundraising &amp; Volunteer Coordinator, and STACY DEMPSEY, Director of Communications, Danielle worked with her team to create a series of fund raising events.  Fund raisers over the past two and half years have included rummage sales, comedy nights, fashion shows, walks, restaurant lunches and dinners, winery events, sporting events including ""Batting for Babies,"" and concerts.  The $33,250 dollars raised to date has been donated to 17 families, adopting children from 8 countries including the United States, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Latvia, Republic of Congo, South Africa, and Uganda. <br/><br/> One poignant adoption story involves 4 children from Ghana.  A loving United States family learned that they would be able to adopt from Ghana and keep a sibling group of three together.  This same US family also learned of an unrelated abandoned little girl on whom they could not turn their backs.  The little girl was 2 years and 8 months old.  She weighed 26.4 pounds.  She was born blind, with cerebral palsy and suffered from a female genital mutilation that went horribly wrong and needed medical attention.  She was unable to sit independently, was non-verbal and unable to crawl.  Her name was Eve.  In Ghana, as well as other parts of the world, children with special needs rarely have access to medical care, are not educated and are frequently abandoned on the streets.  Little Eve lived in a large government orphanage, confined to a crib, and her future did not look promising.  Thanks to grant assistance from Salvation International, the sibling trio and Eve now have medical care, will be educated, and live with a family that loves them unconditionally. <br/><br/> Another adoption story involves two babies named Hope.  The first baby was born in the United States.  When the adoptive parents received their new baby, they gave her the special name of Hope. They enjoyed five days with their new daughter Hope before her birth mother changed her mind and took the baby back for an older cousin to help raise instead.  When the US door closed for these adoptive parents, another one opened in Uganda, Africa.  A child born with extreme developmental delays awaited.  The adoptive parents were unsure if they would be the right family for the child, but then, after reading the baby's file, they discovered her name meant Hope in Ugandan and adopted her.<br/><br/> Grants range from $500 to $5000.00 per family depending on individual situations and funds available by this charitable organization.  All monies awarded by Salvation International are given directly to the adoption agency handling the family's adoption.  Grants are provided to assist adopting families with adoption agency fees and expenses such as medical costs for the adoptive children, travel expenses.  Myriads of other adoption-related costs can be daunting to prospective adopting parents seeking to provide quality home environments for children.  Grants are awarded on a case by case review, but contingent upon completed home studies.<br/><br/> Salvation International awards grants twice a year in June and December.  April 1 is the deadline for June applications. October 1 is the December grant cycle deadline.  Families may apply once in an annual cycle and must be in the adoption process at the time of application.  Applicants must be US citizens residing in the United States.  Applicants must be able to demonstrate that they can provide stable home environments for the children, but significant financial obstacles stand in the way of completing the adoption process.<br/><br/> Salvation International grants may be used for domestic or international, private or agency adoptions.<br/><br/>For more information on the granting process please visit <a href=""http://www.salvationinternational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.salvationinternational.org</a><br/><p><a href=""http://www.salvationinternational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p><br/><p><b><i><u>BOARD

I grew up in the time of Punky Brewster, Webster, and Diff’rent Strokes. I fell
in love with the idea of adoption and promised myself as a young girl that I
was never going to have biological kids of my own. I also promised myself I
would never get married and I would join the Peace Corps after college but as
my idealist self gave away to reality, I got married, never joined the Peace
Corps and had three biological children of my own.<span>I am excited and motivated to help fulfill
Salvation International’s vision that EVERY CHILD DESERVES A FAMILY. Each child
that we help adopt is a gift to the young girl I was. Salvation International
has given me a wonderful opportunity to achieve my dream through these special children
and their families!<span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

for this cause.  There is a need and it becomes greater and greater each
day passing.  I strongly believe in helping those in need.  Every
child deserves a family. There are so many men and women willing and wanting to
complete their families, Salvation International is here to ease some of the
financial burden incurred by adoption.  I wanted and needed to be a part
of completing families. I have two beautiful biological children and I cannot

into our lives for a reason, and that each person should be the change they
want to see in the world. I can’t say that my life was particularly touched by
adoption. That truth shifted when I met Danielle &amp; Jason Fleenor, through
our sons. The friendship we formed was instant &amp; genuine. </span></span><p></p>
<p>After attending several
Salvation fundraising events, I was moved by the Fleenor's generosity, and
impressed that they saw a need in our world, came up with a plan to make a
difference, and put it into action. I became familiar with some of the families
Salvation International had helped and their heart-warming
stories. It was an honor when Jason and Danielle asked me to join their
efforts.  Through this experience, it has been privileged to work
alongside some of the most talented, selfless, inspirational people you could
ever meet. In doing so, I have been a part of bringing families together, and
as a mother of three (biological) children, THAT makes my heart sing! </p>
<p>I am overwhelmed with gratitude because
Danielle, Jason, and Salvation came into my life, allowing me to be a part of
making this world a better place by building families through adoption. </p>

was never going to have biological kids of my own. I also promised myself I
would never get married and I would join the Peace Corps after college but as
my idealist self gave away to reality, I got married, never joined the Peace
Corps and had three biological children of my own.I am excited and motivated to help fulfill
Salvation International’s vision that EVERY CHILD DESERVES A FAMILY. Each child
that we help adopt is a gift to the young girl I was. Salvation International
has given me a wonderful opportunity to achieve my dream through these special children
and their families!
SANDY KORDICK ~ Director of Fundraising & Volunteer CoordinatorI was invited to be a board member for
Salvation International in 2012.  I accepted because Jason and Danielle
Fleenor have a dream to help as many orphaned children find their forever
families as they can.  I have never met two people that have such passion
for this cause.  There is a need and it becomes greater and greater each
day passing.  I strongly believe in helping those in need.  Every
child deserves a family. There are so many men and women willing and wanting to
complete their families, Salvation International is here to ease some of the
financial burden incurred by adoption.  I wanted and needed to be a part
of completing families. I have two beautiful biological children and I cannot
imagine my life without them.  Being able to help provide the same
happiness and completion to other families is rewarding beyond measure.
STACY DEMPSEY ~ Director of Communications I am a big believer that people come
into our lives for a reason, and that each person should be the change they
want to see in the world. I can’t say that my life was particularly touched by
adoption. That truth shifted when I met Danielle & Jason Fleenor, through
our sons. The friendship we formed was instant & genuine. 
After attending several
Salvation fundraising events, I was moved by the Fleenor's generosity, and
impressed that they saw a need in our world, came up with a plan to make a
difference, and put it into action. I became familiar with some of the families
Salvation International had helped and their heart-warming
stories. It was an honor when Jason and Danielle asked me to join their
efforts.  Through this experience, it has been privileged to work
alongside some of the most talented, selfless, inspirational people you could
ever meet. In doing so, I have been a part of bringing families together, and
as a mother of three (biological) children, THAT makes my heart sing! 
I am overwhelmed with gratitude because
Danielle, Jason, and Salvation came into my life, allowing me to be a part of
making this world a better place by building families through adoption.",4.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>We want to help the Sex and Gender Diverse (SGD) community directly,
and we want to do something fun in the wider community. Mr Green Teal/Arachne

<p>We want to run a workshop for people exploring their gender.
In this workshop people will learn makeup skills, clothing and presentation. The
second part of our project is to run a performance night. This performance
night will focus on gender diversity as a theme. It will feature burlesque,
slam poets, drag queens, drag kings and any number of other performers. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/902565723091674/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/902565723091674...</a></p>
<p>We have already started assembling a group of people who
will help out in the workshops, providing free hair cuts, assistance with
makeup and clothing construction. We have performers who are keen to perform
for the community and we will be encouraging participation by the SGD Community. This Indigogo project will
allow us to pay for materials needed and performance venue and equipment.</p>
<p>We can do this project on a shoe string budget, the
difference being we won’t be able to offer workshop participants as many ‘take
home’ gifts or other tangible resources, as these are limited. If we raise enough
money in this campaign, we will make the performance night a free event for the
whole community. If we don’t raise enough money, we will need to charge for
tickets. <br/></p><p>We will use whatever money raised as part of the project to help cover
costs, if we raise more than our target, or are able to save we will be
donating the money to a local SGD organisation, A Gender
Agenda.</p>
<p><b>Our perks</b></p>
<p>We are fortunate because we have many creative friends and
links into the community. These friends are able to support the project by
offering a number of goods, services and art pieces as our perks.  We will do our best to ensure everyone gets
their perks in a timely manner, however due to the nature of our perks – being donated
by others – we cannot fully guarantee the quality or delivery. The perks are
built on a system of trust and respect for others and their ability to deliver.</p>
<p>We have a range of perks. They can be used individually or
arranged to occur at the same time.</p>
<p>We are offering photography sessions where you can have a
photographer come and take photos of you and your friends, families or

sessions, where you can have your makeup done, this could be used with the
photography sessions. There are services to have your hair done/cut. Piercings,  maybe you can document getting your first piercing
done!  There are Green Teal T-shirts on
offer, these are limited edition t-shirts of performer Green Teal. For the burlesque enthusiast there are special
edition, handmade and designed pasties. Original artworks will be part of the
perks.  Post card sets of Mr Green Teal

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once more, you could become a patron of one the four main factions and hire a band of duelists (<em>represented by our 35mm miniatures</em>) for doing some... “<em>work”</em> for you and your faction in order to accumulate enough power to choose the new king of Iberia and start the defense of El Purgatorio or the conquest of the north against the Gauls. </p>
<p>Having printed the rulebook of <strong><em>1650,  A Capa y Espada</em></strong> with your help (<em>thanks ;]</em>), we want this game to become a whole new universe of adventures and very detailed conflicts, spanning the most essential aspects of guerrilla warfare of <strong><em>1650, A Capa y Espada</em></strong> with more bands and detailed information about conflict zones with their sociopolitical and military situation...All these things will increase your gaming experience. For this, we want to print the first expansion books of <strong><em>1650</em></strong>: <strong><em>Dies Irae</em></strong>. Also, we want to start releasing the new Gaul Vanguard of the Usurper faction, and the new material presented in those expansion books.</p>
<p>But what is <strong><em>Dies Irae</em></strong>? Here is a summary for your perusal:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/276097/Indiegogo_Vol1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong>WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Tercio Creativo</em></strong> is a little company. We're only 2 partners/sculptors. For the last few years, we have been releasing single miniatures to build a consistent operations theatre within a solid background concept. Step by step, the game system, its background and the game community is growing and, slowly but surely, we keep hard at work to show you everything we create. We can´t stop it, guys.</p>
<p>There are lots of ideas and amazing new concepts, but money is a big problem. We make every component of our products in Spain. We don´t want to manufacture anything in countries that offer us a cheap cost and in the meantime pay  their workers poverty wages, only for offering you  products with “standard” prices. We want to continue using a traditional production system, from our own “damaged” country, and coherent with the economic situation, help other Spanish companies while we explore exciting new worlds.</p>
<p><strong>CAMPAIGN TARGETS</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is divided into targets, and these are grouped in stages. Each stage will allow us to discover a new and darker aspect of the universe of <strong><em>1650,  A Capa y Espada</em></strong>. Each stage comprises several targets and rewards. When we reach a target, all of you will get a reward (<em>see below</em>) and the possibility to buy the newly unlocked products with high discounts.</p>

Once more, you could become a patron of one the four main factions and hire a band of duelists (represented by our 35mm miniatures) for doing some... “work” for you and your faction in order to accumulate enough power to choose the new king of Iberia and start the defense of El Purgatorio or the conquest of the north against the Gauls. 
Having printed the rulebook of 1650,  A Capa y Espada with your help (thanks ;]), we want this game to become a whole new universe of adventures and very detailed conflicts, spanning the most essential aspects of guerrilla warfare of 1650, A Capa y Espada with more bands and detailed information about conflict zones with their sociopolitical and military situation...All these things will increase your gaming experience. For this, we want to print the first expansion books of 1650: Dies Irae. Also, we want to start releasing the new Gaul Vanguard of the Usurper faction, and the new material presented in those expansion books.
But what is Dies Irae? Here is a summary for your perusal:




WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?
Tercio Creativo is a little company. We're only 2 partners/sculptors. For the last few years, we have been releasing single miniatures to build a consistent operations theatre within a solid background concept. Step by step, the game system, its background and the game community is growing and, slowly but surely, we keep hard at work to show you everything we create. We can´t stop it, guys.
There are lots of ideas and amazing new concepts, but money is a big problem. We make every component of our products in Spain. We don´t want to manufacture anything in countries that offer us a cheap cost and in the meantime pay  their workers poverty wages, only for offering you  products with “standard” prices. We want to continue using a traditional production system, from our own “damaged” country, and coherent with the economic situation, help other Spanish companies while we explore exciting new worlds.
CAMPAIGN TARGETS
This campaign is divided into targets, and these are grouped in stages. Each stage will allow us to discover a new and darker aspect of the universe of 1650,  A Capa y Espada. Each stage comprises several targets and rewards. When we reach a target, all of you will get a reward (see below) and the possibility to buy the newly unlocked products with high discounts.

Confidente (""Informer"") unlocked.


Hideputa (""Sonofabitch"") unlocked.

<p>My name is Vitchel Toussaint. I am currently a senior Psychology major and an active member of Alpha Kappa Psi professional business fraternity at the University Of Buffalo and I would like to introduce you to my passion.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">My Inspiration:</span></strong></h2>
<p>As I embarked on my journey in college from a freshman to now a senior I've learned and grown into a well-rounded young adult. Much like many other students in the collegiate environment I began college with the idea that it's going to be one big fun party which for the most part it is, however at some point between being a freshman and a senior it usually clicks that studying and doing school work is still an important part of the party; that is if you want to stay past 12 am of course. Hearing about the next party on Facebook was never a problem, reading someone’s random thoughts on Twitter always seemed to be the perfect waste of time or even re-living a buddies drunken night through the lens of instagram usually gave me a nice kick.<br/><br/>              I was seemingly constantly connected with ""college"" until it clicked. Where do I go for the immediate peer to peer educational connectivity that will help me keep this ""party"" going? .......</p>

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2>
<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Problem:</span></strong><br/>            </h2>
<h3>        Being connected is a very important aspect of the college experience. Students love to know what's going on around them whether it be Friday nights party, the ""pre-game"" in room 461 or even that rare moment we are being studious and need academic help. We have social media outlets that provide continuous connectivity for the pre-games and parties but nothing tailored to educational connectivity. </h3>

With the foundation laid this unique service will be topped with many defining features such as the Strength/Weakness feature and many many more.

The world around us is constantly changing so why not the face of business? We recognize that our target market is composed of very active, hands on and creative individuals. We want this to be as much of our passion as it is theirs, after all without users and a great experience for them who are we. We will achieve this by opening a Facebook page where our community will be in the ""board room"" putting in there own input,creating polls and stirring the pot for future updates/features, a twitter page to keep everyone updated about news/ new features and an Instagram for our community to send pictures and reflect on the academic achievement of the people! We will strive to embody a business environment as well as a social presence where our community is not only benefiting  from the use of the service but they are also inspired and encouraged to bring there ideas and concepts to the ""board room"" and with community support have them implemented!


Help Get the ball rolling:
                                            
 We are looking to raise a $7,000. This initial contribution will go towards research & development of the mobile application, securing server space & deployment to our well deserving community.

Will you be a part history?


 
The Impact
With your support the problem that many college students today face with finding study partners or just academic help can potentially meet its demise. Every contribution will be a valued part of educational history in the United States and one day even the world. I along with future users greatly appreciate any and every contribution you are willing to give out of the kindness of your heart, for ""As one we survive, as a group we thrive"" - WeStudy

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My wife and I found out we were pregnant in Nov 2009. Of course, we were extremely excited and started planning as all new parents do. My wife had a pretty rough regnancy but things seemed to be OK as per ultrasounds and other tests.</p>
<p>When Tyler was born, he was just the cutest little dude in the world. We both worked at home and spent many hours with him. It was all going well, until he started to show some developmental delays at around 10 months old. He didn't sit up on his own and seemed to 'zone out' somewhat. He also didn't really keep too much eye contact.</p>
<p>He was originally diagnosed as Hyper-Defensive Sensory Processing Disorder. In a  nutshell, that means he was ultra sensitive to touch, all over his body. This explained his not crawling and sitting up, and delays in walking also, as the feelings he experienced when trying these things overrode his whole sensory system and he couldn't concentrate.</p>
<p>He started therapy, but it wasn't long before he fell further and further behind and started to 'forget' things he'd learned before. Just before age 3, he was diagnosed with mild/moderate Autistic.</p>
<p>Now one of the GREAT things that happens, is that here in NC, and I believe most other states, There are special classes offered to children in Tyler's situation. They are held full day in small classes of usually 6 to 9 children with one teacher and to teaching assistants. Tyler was lucky enough to be placed full day and the classes offer amazing structure and help in so many ways, especially with social assistance and exposure.</p>
<p>Here's the kicker and the whole reason for this campaign.</p>
<p>Everyone knows most schools are underfunded in the first place. When it comes to allocation of funds, they trickle down and the Pre-K AU (Special Education for Younger children Classes) are almost ALWAYS last to receive funds, if they receive any at all. Special Needs classes are often looked at as the unwanted and things to be ignored.</p>
<p>Now normal fundraising is done through groups like the PTA. However, once again, any funds raised by the PTA very rarely filter down to the special Ed Classrooms.</p>
<p>Special Education teachers are known to typically pay over $1500 a year of their OWN money to buy things for their classes and children. These are not toys and gifts. These are items are that essentially needed to provide a basic education.</p>
<p>My Campaign is to fund Tyler's Classroom (In Wilburn Elementary School) with JUST 5 items. 3 Bookcases... YES something as SIMPLE as a Bookcase is in dire need We need three of them so we can get the books out of plastic tubs. The fourth item would be an Apple iPad and the fifth is a special case to protect it. Autistic children often do very well with technology such as iPads for learning as it helps their focus and simple solving skills, along with learning taking turns and slowing themselves down.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The entire funding would go towards buying these five (or hopefully more!) items and would be provided immediately to the classroom so they could benefit from them ASAP. The impact of helping children with Autism when they are at such a young age has been scientifically proven to help produce more and more people with Autism function in a more fully functional way in the world. The more help and therapy received by an Autistic child, the better their chances are for progressing to a full-functioning 'normal' or 'typical' classroom with everyday children.</p>
<p>Your generous donation would be a small, but extremely important step in assisting those less fortunate than ourselves and help to fill a great void in our education system for these exceptionally special Children.</p>
<p>If the full goal is not reached, then any money donated will be used to purchase whatever we can for the classroom. Perhaps just one Bookcase. </p>
<p>If more than the goal is reached, then the remainder of the money would used to purchase more books, and Autistic children are notoriously tough on books and they often need replacing. But again, they're an essential teaching project.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Autism is unfortunately an extremely fast growing diagnosis for children in this day and age. Nowadays, 1 in 88 children are diagnosed Autistic. The more progress we can make now, the better we can be prepared for the future and hopefully find a cure for Autism for the the millions of people who are currently and are diagnosed each and every day.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't or don't wish to donate to this campaign, but it still touches you, please think about asking your local elementary school is there is anything their PRE-K AU classrooms may need. It could be as small as a pack of Crayola's, or some Lamination paper. There are always plenty of ways to help and the school teachers would GREATLY appreciate it.</p></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<p>We just founded a registered corporation in Japan. It’s called “World Fun Learning Association” (We obviously believe learning should be fun).</p>
<p>Through our activities (including conversation with locals) so far, we realized that we should make us more credible, especially if we want to collaborate with other organizations.</p>
<p>So now we are responsible for corporate tax, financial results and stuff, but it’s worth it!</p>

</ul></div>","Update 6/22: 
We just founded a registered corporation in Japan. It’s called “World Fun Learning Association” (We obviously believe learning should be fun).
Through our activities (including conversation with locals) so far, we realized that we should make us more credible, especially if we want to collaborate with other organizations.
So now we are responsible for corporate tax, financial results and stuff, but it’s worth it!
*Since this corporation might keep working on other non-profit/profit projects after this one, we are not using the money from this campaign for the corporation filing fee. Masaki, the founder, paid from his personal account (it costed about $1400).
 
 
In case you don't know, this is what happened in Tohoku in 2011. 

 
Overview
     In Ishinomaki City, a strong, independent people are taking the first steps back toward rebuilding the community they lost in the tsunami of 2011.  Children whose schools were destroyed are learning again in other schools.  Jobs that were lost in the torrent that washed away businesses and factories are being replaced with rebuilding work.  Emergency funds are providing food and temporary housing for families who lost their homes and their income.   
     But these things are not enough.  All of these steps are important, and the people of the city are raising their heads, but so far, these things are just not enough.  The people of this community need ways to interact with each other and with the outside world.  They need access to training in skills available from outside the community.  They need better and faster communications and access to data banks that will allow them to reach out to resources and information in their own community and in the outside world.  They need assistance in becoming a united, independent community again.
Quotes
""Possibly the weakest work skills among local residents is in the IT field and computer literacy. After the disaster, many people didn’t know how to use the computer for communicating with family and friends about their safety or how to find each other."" - Japan Daily Press
""In the aftermath, services like Facebook and Twitter surged in users and have become part of Japanese society"". - PC World
""...we are focusing on two main areas of online retailing and information sharing, based on building local communities, branding of local products, improving IT literacy and so on."" - Takuya HASEGAWA, Yahoo Japan
""Two years later, there is less and less of a focus on the survivors. Both media attention and financial support have decreased."" - Sophia Slater,  Huffington Post
 
Temporary housing in Ishinomaki (one of many). Quite a few people there don't have good mental condition.We plan to visit them to organize fun events such as playing with instrument apps, origami apps, or Karaoke apps on tablets and so on.
 
The Project


Provide IT summer classes (July though September) for children, the unemployed, and the eldery who don’t have computer literacy in Ishinomaki city, where 3400 people died because of the tsunami in 2011.


For children, introduce a blended learning approach using fun mobile apps and actual tutoring. Teaching English using IT would also be an option.


For the elderly, introduce the concept of websites, emails and SNS, and how computers and mobile devices work. Hold recreational events  for the people who live in the temporary housing.


In the higher level classes, introduce many affordable/free e-learning services.

Take the “Teach a man how to fish instead of giving him a fish” approach. Introduce our learners to opportunities to start sustainable learning.


Our project will be called “e-gnite” (igniting e-learning/e-literacy).

Impact

Using internet opportunities for increased communication and interaction within the group should allow this community of survivors to be more effective in responding to each other’s needs. (Sadly, there are many people who still live in temporary housing.)

We wil try to solve the ""digital divide"" issue which was huge especially right after the earthquake. The people who didn't know how to use PC/smartphones couldn't get the information about safe areas, open shops, etc. This shouldn't happen IF a similar situation occurs.

We will help these learners find e-learning services suitable for each individual. This sustainable learning would make a long term impact for their life.


We believe that a demonstrated success in this method works will allow us to implement it in other areas such as Africa or South East Asia.

Who I am 



I am an e-learning consultant in Tokyo. My focus is providing right services and tools suitable for my clients, after hearing what they want to learn, for what porpose, until when, etc. Actually, I even ask what their hobbies are to introduce customized solutions. 


Although I don't call myself an ""engineer"", I have basic knowlege of network (Cisco Certified Network Associate), hardware (Linux Professional Institute Certificate), and programming (Oracle Certified Java Programmer Bronze).


I myself am a passionate e-learner. After I became 20 years old, I started studying really hard to learn English. I also studied the fundamentals of many languages, including Spanish, French, Chinese, German, and Korean. Although I don’t currently speak these languages well except for English, those study experiences helped me to gain an insight into effective e-learning processes.


I have worked as a video game translater and also as an translation coordinator for SquareEnix games. I also translated Tim Ferris’ TED talk.


I have also worked as a quality assurance lead tester for global IT companies.


I traveled to over 20 countries with a backpack. :)

If you are interested in other personal insights into me, please check out my blog.

How we will use your money



We will use it mainly for expenses such as devices, rent for the class room, transportation, Internet connection fee, etc.(10 tablets and 2 PCs alone would cost $5000...)


If adequate funds are accumulated, we expect to scale up activities by adding more teachers and buying more devices for learner use.


All unexpended funds will be donated to NPOs or will be used for possible extension of this project.


This is expected to be a non-profit project. No one will receive payment exceeding expenses (such as rent, computers, food, transportation, insurance, and tax).*If the funding exceeds our goal, the e-gnite project may form a registered NPO to allow some staff to receive a salary.

 This is another space we can use for our classes/events. It's owned by NPO ""Ishinomaki 2.0"".
 

Your Rewards 


We will send gifts to you after we finish this project. Please see the Perks section.
So far we have these gifts:
 Thank-you e-mail
 e-book
 original postcards
  origami made by students or staff

Charms made from slates of the tsunami-hit area.(For details please see CharmWorks)

<p>I am Aunampai Passackchai, Buddhist nun and Director of Dhammajarinee Witthaya School, the first and only free boarding school for girls in poverty in Thailand.  In Thailand boys who are poor or orphaned can go to a temple as a novice monk and receive an education. This has not been the case for girls. Seeing this inequality and the devastating consequences, this school was founded.  Please watch our video and kindly help us build a new building to protect hundreds of more girls who wish to come because they lack educational opportunity.  All donations go directly to the school.</p>
<p><strong>THE PROBLEM<br/></strong></p>
<p>Many poor families in Thailand are not able to send their daughters to school, or past grade school, and instead young girls are often employed in degrading occupations putting them at risk of exploitation, abuse, AIDs, depression and addiction.  Due to socio-economic problems and recent natural disasters, girls in poverty are more vulnerable than ever before. There are 430 girls attending Dhammajarinee Witthaya School. Many come from broken homes and are often abused, abandoned, or orphans, or have failed in other schools. More girls want to come, but we lack space and need your help.</p>
<p><strong>OUR CAMPAIGN / SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>A plan to construct a large new classroom building for about 500 more girls is underway. Some money has come from the government and private donors but we still need to quickly raise $135,000. Your contribution will enable all current students to finish high school, hundreds of more students to come next year, and it will help thousands of girls who will graduate from this school in the future.</p>
<p><strong>OUR SCHOOL</strong></p>
<p>Our charity school is highly rated and respected for its quality education and focus on development of character and integrity to help young women become successful leaders, educators and mothers. The school incorporates meditation to reduce the trauma most these girls have experienced early in their lives. Worldwide it is well documented that when you educate a girl in poverty, you give her and her family a higher standard of living and her village is cleaner. You give her better health, and her children are healthier and more educated and grow up to respect and protect women. This is the real foundation of a peaceful, progressive world. These girls depend on the generous support of people like you.</p>
<p><strong>We need your donation to help more girls to create a better world !!</strong></p>

<p> </p></div>","The Big Picture


Politics around the American education system is raging and much of it is focused on teachers. 

How do we best evaluate teachers? 
How much should test scores determine teacher worth?
How many ways we can evaluate the characteristics of a great teacher? 
How can we get more teachers to produce the same results as successful teachers?
Meanwhile, many educators feel overworked and/or pressured to make curriculum choices that focus more on standardization and current evaluation systems than on the creativity and relevancy needs of their students. It's no wonder that teacher job dissatisfaction and student apathy are at all time highs. 
 
So while political debates continue to work towards a better tomorrow,we work to support the individual teacher and their students in the classroom TODAY.
 
 
 
OUR UNIQUE ORGANIZATION
 

Our organization works at two levels: 

Direct support for the teacher 
Unique programs for students 
 
Personal Assistance to Individual Teachers
We provide our teachers with: 

coaching and modeled lessons online and in the classroom
weekly email with lessons and resources 
personalized lesson design or research
resources on our website or by request

                                  
Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for teachers to bring creativity and relevancy back to the classroom.      
 
Student Programs
We also provide three student programs that support the work teachers are doing in class: the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards, NAS (Not A Statistic—to combat the Achievement Gap) and Voices In Verse (a spoken word youth poetry curriculum and competition).
 

 
Please visit our website to learn more about each individual program. We also invite you to read the comments from teachers and students.
 
Membership with our organization has been steadily growing and we have expanded to meet the needs of more teachers and students, but we have been struck with a problem.
The Problem
In order to meet growing demands, we turned The English Teacher's Friend into a nonprofit in January of 2012 and we filed for 501c3 status. This would enable us to apply for grants and larger sponsorships in an effort to reach more teachers and students.
 
The normal processing time for a nonprofit organization to receive their 501c3 status is 3-6 months. But due to an IRS backlog, we waited an unprecedented 16 months.Without this 501c3 status, we were unable to apply for grants or secure sponsorships. Although we were prepared for the standard wait period, we were simply unable to compensate for a 16 month delay AND the unpredicted (albeit pleasing) growth we have seen. 

How Your Donation Will Help
The start of school is upon us and the next 3-6 months are the busiest and most important in the school year for our organization and for the teachers and students we serve.
 
In order to best assist the teachers, saving them countless hours by providing learning materials and support, we need to be able to keep our four curriculum members on staff. 
 
We also have 3 student programs that all kick off in the fall (in order to utilize the most time with students). These programs will need funding primarily through August and September.
 
Because we just received our 501c3 status in June, we have only just begun the grant writing process. It will be months before we see any results. What we need now is funding to cover the minimum costs for the next 5 months.
 
                
What Your Donation Will Cover
We have various other sources of revenue, but until our grant funding starts coming in we need a minimum of $48,500
 
The complete $48,500 will provide the following:
 

Personalized assistance for 300+ middle and high school English teachers. These quality lessons and resources focus on engagement, creativity and relevancy potentially reaching 30,000 students throughout the US (mostly in Florida).
Writing and Common Core Professional Development for 200+ middle and high school English and Social Studies teachers.
Writing workshops and individualized instruction for 200+ middle and high school students.
Partial salary for 5 staff members Aug – Nov 2013. (Executive Director is not taking a salary during this time) 
 
Against the Odds
We have chosen a very quick, aggressive campaign even though some have suggested a smaller, longer campaign. 
 
We do not want to bombard our friends and members with fundraising requests. And more importantly, we want to dedicate all our time to helping teachers and their students. We are hoping to get the support so we can get to work. 
 

 
We know that $48,500 is a lofty goal.
 
But we believe our members, friends, and those who know our students need more creative outlets in our schools will spread the word quickly to help us reach this goal.  
 
Perks for Supporters
Most of our perks in the $5 -250 range are specific for teachers. The perks in the $500 - $2,000 range are geared towards businesses. Please review the perks offered and if you want to negotiate another option, we are more than happy to do that as well. Just contact us.
 
 
 
We thank you so much for your support
If you have any questions, please contact us. 
 
If you cannot provide a financial donation, we would be most grateful if you can forward this to friends and family, share on Facebook, ask others help us through this phase.  
 
We cannot do this without you.",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

W H A T
2014 Tibetan Medicine Conference: Ancient Medicine for Modern Life: Tibetan Solutions for Stress Management, Chronic Illness and Mental Health
W H E R E
The Rubin Museum of Art in New York City
W H E NJuly 25th-27th, 2014
H O WWith Your Generous Support & Enthusiasm to Spread the Word!

GIVING & RECEIVING

 • Help to raise $7500 USD to preserve and promote the practice of Tibetan medicine (TM), as well as to standardize the education and professional standards of Western practitioners of TM.  This campaign will help us to enable experts from around the world to assemble and share their unique knowledge with students, attendees and those who suffer with cancer, arthritis, heart disease, stroke, and mental illness.
 • Our unique perks for donors (while supplies last) include: A locket from Tibet with relics, a Dalai Lama Medallion, massage treatments, a Gaiam yoga mat, and Tibetan Medical consultations. Do you have a perk we can offer? Does becoming a sponsor of the conference sound interesting to you? Call Ashley at (413) 489-1414. (Tibetan speaking call: (415) 681-1643.) Get excited and donate! :) 
 • Even if we don't reach our fundraising goal, the funds we do receive will be used towards this cause. The conference will still be held and we'll do our best with your generous contributions. This historic event will be open to the public and coincides with The Rubin Museum of Art’s current exhibition about Tibetan medicine: Bodies in Balance.
This campaign is raising funds on behalf of The American Tibetan Medical Association, a US based 501(c)3 non-profit. All contributions are to be considered unrestricted gifts.
THE CONFERENCE

Since its formation in 2008, the American Tibetan Medical Association (ATMA) has initiated a movement to preserve and promote the practice of Tibetan medicine (TM), as well as to standardize the education and professional standards of Western practitioners of TM. 
The ever-smaller number of senior Tibetan Medicine practitioners who received their education more than 50 years ago are living treasure holders. Their ways of practice and deep understanding of the traditions are at risk of being lost forever due to the average age of the practitioner, compounded by his/her location in isolated regions. 
The circumstantial restraints of travel and communication in these remote areas limits his/her options for communing with fellow practitioners and passing on this wisdom to younger doctors. Hand-in-hand with this reality is the growing number of practitioners outside of Tibet/India who receive educations of varying quality, depth, and rigor, and who are practicing with neither the protection of a governing body nor a uniform professional code of conduct. Through a number of efforts, ATMA (working with it's partner The Shang Shung Institute) hopes to bring resolution to both forces shaping the practice of TM today.
The conference will be open to the public and focuses on traditional Tibetan Medicine and Buddhist perspectives on caring for the individual. Interwoven throughout the weekend will be opportunities for hands-on experience in Tibetan medicine techniques.  The conference will couple theory and practice, alternating between historical/theoretical/conceptual education. The conference focuses on Tibetan Medicine at its best with rigorous investigation of how TM is used to care for cancer, arthritis, heart disease, stroke, and mental illness—those conditions so prevalent and confounding for the American public and the doctors who serve them.
ATMA’s presentation of the standardization of practice and education of Tibetan medicine will be the highlight of the event. Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, Honorary Chief Advisor, ATMA, will deliver the lead address. We will assemble, document, and archive this immense knowledge of Tibetan medicine’s great living masters who are currently practicing throughout Tibet, India, and the Himalayan region. 
THE IMPACT

ATMA has been developing standards for the licensing, practice, and education [the equivalent of a Bachelor’s degree and a Master’s degree in Tibet] of Tibetan Medicine, and is ready to finalize and codify these efforts. 
Dr. Phuntsog Wangmo, President and Founder of ATMA, and Director of both Shang Shung International Institute of Tibetan Medicine and Shang Shung School of Tibetan Medicine (United States and Russia), has been participating in a series of meetings, first in Tibet, and then throughout the United States, in order to prepare the first draft of the standards and solicit professional support for the movement. 
ATMA will present these standards for practice and education at this conference on Tibetan Medicine in July 2014.


Attendees are expected from around the world. These will include practitioners, students, persons impacted by these diseases, their families and caregivers, as well as those interested in alternative healing modalities. Long-practicing doctors from Tibet, India, and the greater Himalayan region will serve as honored speakers.
This conference can be viewed as an important vehicle for uniting practitioners around a common set of goals and guidelines, disseminating information regarding the relevance and efficacy of Tibetan Medicine, and just as importantly, a way to bring together the living masters of the Tibetan Medicine. tradition. 
These great Menpas (doctors) can be brought together to share with each other and the assembled Western practitioners, students, and public. Their exchanges will be documented and held at SSI, which is expert at archiving and disseminating many forms of Tibetan culture and wisdom.

</p><p><b>Greetings,</b></p>
<p>  I’m Tre
Alexander and I’m soliciting your aid in helping me attend the <b>International AIDS Conference, this year,
in Melbourne, Australia.</b> </p>
<p><b>About Me </b></p>
<p>  I’m a
single father to a 12 year old son and a foster parent to an 18 year old and 6
year old. I was born and raised in Philadelphia
 Pennsylvania. I graduated from
the Philadelphia Public
 School system and attended Lehigh University.
</p>
<p>  For over 25
years, I have been a community activist and organizer working extensively with
troubled youth through mentoring; educating and helping them find positive
solutions to their problems. </p>
<p><b>My Journey into the
Field</b></p>
<p>  I’m the
youngest of five siblings and my journey into this work began after loosing my
only brother 8 years ago to AIDS. His death was the catalyst that pushed me
into the field because I needed to get answers. I needed to find out why so
many have been struck down by this disease. I needed to find out what I could
do to ensure that those with the disease had access to a better quality of life
and those persons at high risk would have the proper information around
prevention, treatment and care. </p>
<p><b>My Work in the Field </b></p>
<p>  For the
past 8 years, I have worked extensively with HIV+ former and currently
incarcerated men and women.</p>
<p>I currently work for <b>Philadelphia FIGHT’S Institute for
Community Justice as a Prison Linkage Specialist</b> where I visit inmates,
coordinate linkage of HIV related services upon release, perform needs
assessments, and develop discharge plans. I collaborate and provide coordinated
prevention, discharge planning, and treatment interventions for inmates in
concert with <b>Corizon, AACO, Action AIDS,
PA MidAtlantic,</b> public health officials and community-based organizations
to assess issues within correctional systems. </p>
<p><b>Why do I want to
attend this conference</b>? </p>
<p>  The
International AIDS Conference is the premier gathering for those working in the
field of HIV, as well as policy makers, persons living with HIV and other
individuals committed to ending the pandemic. It is a chance to assess where we
are, evaluate recent scientific developments and lessons learnt, and
collectively chart a course forward. </p>
<p>  As an
HIV/AIDS Activist and father, my mission is to use the information I obtain on prevention,
treatment and care and use it to continually educate and hold positive
discussions with youth groups within our communities who are at high risk for
contracting the disease.</p>
<p>  My hope is
that in sharing this information with persons at risk and those affected by
HIV/AIDS we can begin to strip away the stigma and discrimination associated
with the disease that create fear and barriers to getting tested, accessing
treatment and remaining in care.</p>

Philadelphia, PA.  Our school was built in 1926-1928 and named for Mr.
John Story Jenks a prominent, affluent and philanthropic member of the
community.  From the onset, Jenks humbly served the communities of
Chestnut Hill and Mt. Airy as a public school free to all.  </b>
</p><p></p>
<p><b>Over the past six years, our Leadership Team has implemented several
initiatives that will help make our students more successful in both higher
education as well as career.  Our mission is to engage our students where
their talents and interests lie, building success experience that will transfer
to areas of greater challenge.  Some of these new initiatives include: the
Jenks Arts and Music (JAM) Program, the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering
and Math) Program, Primary Shared Classroom Experiences, and the Middle School
Clinic Period for remediation and challenge.</b></p>
<p><b>We are currently seeking to reinvent three learning environments in our
building that connect and promote these established programs: the computer lab,
the library media center, and our two kindergarten classrooms.  <br/><br/>
Our computer lab and library share a space in an addition built in the late
1960s. All that divides these two spaces are three bookcases.  This
presents several problems if we are to use both spaces as classroom
environments.  We cycle a full computer class roster for our K-8 homerooms
throughout the week in the computer lab while simultaneously using the
antiquated library space for overflow music classes.  Whenever possible,
we try to minimize the impact of noise and distractions that come when two
classes must occur at the same time. Unfortunately, it does prevent us from
optimally using the space.<br/><br/>
$16,000 would enable us to move the Computer Lab and Library/Media Center into
two distinct spaces, which currently house two kindergarten classrooms. 
To move the computer lab, we would need to wire one of the classrooms at the
estimated cost of $14,000.  An additional, $2000 would allow us to
electrically upgrade our new Library/Media Center for SMART technology.  <br/><br/>
The new Library Media Center, once isolated out into a classroom will need to
be fitted with new bookcases, tables, chairs, and rugs at an
estimated cost of $4000. Specifically, the money will be directed toward
upgrading the Library Media Center with a desktop computer and a large screen
monitor for International Skyping with foreign penpals. Another desktop
computer will provide a dedicated open line to NASA, an integral component to
our STEM initiatives. Once completed, this space will not only be used by
students but by staff and parents as a place for teachers to collaborate and
plan. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>We expect to pay $2000 for First Giving fees, Indiegogo fees, the cost of
donor perks and video production costs. <br/><br/>
The two kindergarten classrooms would be relocated into the shared space housed
in the addition.  This move would be consistent with the Shared Learning
Environments already proving successful in our first and second grades. 
Additionally, the new Kindergarten Center will allow for team teaching,
increased differentiation, and a dedicated outdoor space for our kindergarten
students enhanced by a Children's Garden.  This vastly larger space will
unite the two classrooms taking elements from the open classroom and team
teaching.  The students will have their own entrance and kindergarten
schoolyard. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Money raised beyond our goal will be dedicated in the following ways: 
</b></p>
<p><b>1)  New furniture will include a Lego building table, Train
layout station with wooden track and table, as well as aquariums and terrariums to promote STEM initiatives -
$2000.  </b></p>
<p><b>2)  Teachers will have space to create additional centers (i.e.-sand and water tables) for students to
explore while still having a gathering place for all students during Storytime,
Wee Sing (Kindergarten Choir) and whole group instruction - $2000. </b></p>
<p><b>3)  Murals will adorn the walls and the entry hallway will serve as
the coatroom - $1500.  </b></p>
<p><b>3)  Just outside the center, in the kindergarten schoolyard, we
will paint student-sized roads and community layouts using cement paint -
$800.  </b></p>
<p><b>4)  The Children’s Garden will include picnic tables and bird
feeders.  Four raised beds will be part of the outdoor classroom and allow
students to actively study life cycles - $4000.   </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>If we, sadly, fail to reach our goal, all money collected will go toward
the upgraded electrical wiring necessary to relocate the computer lab.</b></p>
<p><b><br/>
This project is important to the entire school community.  All students in
Kindergarten through eighth grade will be able to research or study in the new
Library Media Center.  We will be able to offer additional and enriching
classes themed to our courses of study (bucket band, STEM, Legos/K'NEX) that do
not impose on one another.  Our Kindergarten Center will provide a strong
academic environment that will bring learning to life through a multitude of
mini-learning environments.  Your contribution can make all of this
possible.  </b></p>

<p><b>Whatever the denomination, our students will benefit from your
gift.  If you cannot give at this time, help us spread the word to friends

2)  Teachers will have space to create additional centers (i.e.-sand and water tables) for students to
explore while still having a gathering place for all students during Storytime,
Wee Sing (Kindergarten Choir) and whole group instruction - $2000. 
3)  Murals will adorn the walls and the entry hallway will serve as
the coatroom - $1500.  
3)  Just outside the center, in the kindergarten schoolyard, we
will paint student-sized roads and community layouts using cement paint -
$800.  
4)  The Children’s Garden will include picnic tables and bird
feeders.  Four raised beds will be part of the outdoor classroom and allow
students to actively study life cycles - $4000.   

If we, sadly, fail to reach our goal, all money collected will go toward
the upgraded electrical wiring necessary to relocate the computer lab.

This project is important to the entire school community.  All students in
Kindergarten through eighth grade will be able to research or study in the new
Library Media Center.  We will be able to offer additional and enriching
classes themed to our courses of study (bucket band, STEM, Legos/K'NEX) that do
not impose on one another.  Our Kindergarten Center will provide a strong
academic environment that will bring learning to life through a multitude of
mini-learning environments.  Your contribution can make all of this
possible.  

Whatever the denomination, our students will benefit from your
gift.  If you cannot give at this time, help us spread the word to friends
who are committed to building libraries, forwarding math and science standards,
or simply remember the joy of being a kid in kindergarten.  Please help us
make some noise about our campaign and use the Indiegogo share tools!

<b>
<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">Taking its name from the Spanish word for “hope,” Esperanza Dance Project was started in January 2011 in Tucson, Ariz., by choreographer and director Beth Braun, a professional dancer and high school dance educator. The Esperanza Dance Project believes in eradicating stigma, secrecy and shame associated with childhood sexual violence.</span></h4>
<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">Our project involves more than 25 teen and adult dancers, artists, writers and performers of diverse ethnicities, genders and backgrounds.</span></h4>
<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">Our vision is that all high school students in Arizona be able to recognize warning signs associated with sexual violence, feel comfortable discussing it openly and compassionately, and become familiar with local resources for support. Studies show that every year, there are more than 200,000 victims of sexual assault in the United States, and 44 percent of sexual assault victims are under the age of 18 (Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network).</span></h4>

<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">Esperanza Dance Project’s goal for the 2013-14 school year is to bring our message of hope, strength and empowerment to eight Tucson high schools. Our multimedia performance conveys “the journey of a survivor, moving from youthful energy to pain to numbness, and on to ultimate healing” (Tucson Weekly, June 16, 2011).</span></h4>
<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">Our main expense is the Esperanza Dance Project comprehensive curriculum, which includes a multi-page study guide for students and teachers that is distributed prior to the assembly.</span></h4>
<h4>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">The study guide is designed to give teachers, counselors and other school staff members a platform to initiate a discussion about the impact of sexual violence and the healing process with students. The dancers, who undergo training in the Southern Arizona Center Against Sexual Assault’s</span><span style=""""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">Community Prevention Education and Outreach Program</span><span style="""">, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">facilitate discussions about this study guide in classrooms before each assembly.</span>
</h4>
<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">The guide contains detailed information about the performance and issues of concern surrounding childhood sexual abuse and sexual violence.

What is Esperanza Dance Project?

Taking its name from the Spanish word for “hope,” Esperanza Dance Project was started in January 2011 in Tucson, Ariz., by choreographer and director Beth Braun, a professional dancer and high school dance educator. The Esperanza Dance Project believes in eradicating stigma, secrecy and shame associated with childhood sexual violence.
Our project involves more than 25 teen and adult dancers, artists, writers and performers of diverse ethnicities, genders and backgrounds.
Our vision is that all high school students in Arizona be able to recognize warning signs associated with sexual violence, feel comfortable discussing it openly and compassionately, and become familiar with local resources for support. Studies show that every year, there are more than 200,000 victims of sexual assault in the United States, and 44 percent of sexual assault victims are under the age of 18 (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network).

Why do we need your help?
Esperanza Dance Project’s goal for the 2013-14 school year is to bring our message of hope, strength and empowerment to eight Tucson high schools. Our multimedia performance conveys “the journey of a survivor, moving from youthful energy to pain to numbness, and on to ultimate healing” (Tucson Weekly, June 16, 2011).
Our main expense is the Esperanza Dance Project comprehensive curriculum, which includes a multi-page study guide for students and teachers that is distributed prior to the assembly.

The study guide is designed to give teachers, counselors and other school staff members a platform to initiate a discussion about the impact of sexual violence and the healing process with students. The dancers, who undergo training in the Southern Arizona Center Against Sexual Assault’s Community Prevention Education and Outreach Program, facilitate discussions about this study guide in classrooms before each assembly.

The guide contains detailed information about the performance and issues of concern surrounding childhood sexual abuse and sexual violence. It offers an explanation of each section of the assembly, including questions for the students to reflect upon and journal about, information about local resources for support, and a parent permission slip. 

Each study guide costs about $2 to produce. We are asking the high schools to contribute half the cost of the printing, or $1 per student. 

We need to raise $6,000 to cover the remaining printing costs and production expenses for our 2013-2014 high school assembly season. Money raised will also help ensure that schools unable to contribute will still be able to experience Esperanza Dance Project.


Impact
Esperanza Dance Project held its first student assemblies in November 2011 and February 2012 at Rincon High School and University High School in Tucson, Ariz. Esperanza Dance Project has also performed at Take Back the Night 2011 and 2012,  community events sponsored by SACASA and the University of Arizona.  
The following testimonials capture the impact of the Esperanza Dance Project so far:
“The choreography is brilliant. The student narration was a great idea and the music was most appropriate.  Your audience really related to the piece … The study guides provided valuable information.”
-- Joan Ashcraft, Ph.D., Tucson Unified School District Director of Fine and Performing Arts/Opening Minds through the Arts

“The Esperanza experience is profound for all students: performers and audiences alike.  All increase their level of compassion for and their ability to support the empowerment of survivors and come away with tools for helping victims own the fact that it was not their fault.""

-- Kirsten Cook, MA, LPC, retired counselor, University High School
“The audience asked such insightful questions: ‘How can we be allies to someone who has suffered childhood sexual assault?’ ‘How do we talk to our friends about this?’ ‘What do we do when we know someone who might be suicidal?’  I was so incredibly happy that we got people talking, and everyone in the auditorium seemed to be genuinely interested in what was being discussed. I felt very humbled that day.”
-- Nic Varela, dancer 
“Identity and personal boundaries, abuse and harassment, addiction and transformation, hope and healing were not generally topics of discussion overheard in the cafeteria at lunch. Esperanza challenged audience members to engage, not run away from, these important topics … The Esperanza Dance Project brings honesty, human connection and a sense of purpose to high school students at a time when they need it the most. My experience with Esperanza was transformative – but I am just one of many who have been touched, stretched and moved by the Esperanza Dance Project.”
--Allyson Yoder, alumna

Esperanza Dance Project has received grants from the Tucson Pima Arts Council and from Unidas, a Girls Philanthropy Program at the Women’s Foundation of Southern Arizona.

never seen a campaign like this before. We might see articles and know of many
households that are going through this. With this said, I want to show the
other side of the typical macho household and teach our society that there must
be equality not only out in our community, but in our own homes. I want to show
parents how important it is to teach our kids gender equality. We must educate
men that no matter if they are the ones bringing income into our homes there
must be equality<span>! ""We have
too many of our bright, young kids either working low-pay jobs or in jail, when
they should be in college. This is unacceptable."" This type of campaign
will show our kids to be socially responsible, solidary, and have good feeling
towards others. </span></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/></p><p></p><p>By contributing on the production of this campaign on video and photo sessions, we’re offering the opportunity of accompanying me in the video presentation to the media release. To the campaign 2014 we will be including Personalities from the radio, music, and our community will be representing the daily chores that women have to realize such as: Washing dishes, changing diapers, cooking, doing laundry, etc. Our purpose is to plead for our women to have equality at home with the opposite gender. As parents it’s important to promote our kids to help in our home chores. Which is to benefit our whole family. When you ask your kids to collaborate you should explain that it’s a family and they must help. If you can't contribute but want to help, please, share this campaign with your friends and family.

T-shirts. We want everyone to feel as excited as we are for this project!The ImpactWe’ve
never seen a campaign like this before. We might see articles and know of many
households that are going through this. With this said, I want to show the
other side of the typical macho household and teach our society that there must
be equality not only out in our community, but in our own homes. I want to show
parents how important it is to teach our kids gender equality. We must educate
men that no matter if they are the ones bringing income into our homes there
must be equality! ""We have
too many of our bright, young kids either working low-pay jobs or in jail, when
they should be in college. This is unacceptable."" This type of campaign
will show our kids to be socially responsible, solidary, and have good feeling
towards others. Other Ways You Can HelpBy contributing on the production of this campaign on video and photo sessions, we’re offering the opportunity of accompanying me in the video presentation to the media release. To the campaign 2014 we will be including Personalities from the radio, music, and our community will be representing the daily chores that women have to realize such as: Washing dishes, changing diapers, cooking, doing laundry, etc. Our purpose is to plead for our women to have equality at home with the opposite gender. As parents it’s important to promote our kids to help in our home chores. Which is to benefit our whole family. When you ask your kids to collaborate you should explain that it’s a family and they must help. If you can't contribute but want to help, please, share this campaign with your friends and family. We want to get this campaign out there and really help our community.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Did you know that HOPE is teachable? 
It is true!  Research suggests that Hope can be taught (Rand and Cheavens, 2008), and that the greater the hope, the greater the level of well-being (Scioli, 2009).  Why is this important for kids?  Did you know?

1 in 9 children attempt suicide before high
school graduation, and 40% of those are in grade school.  There is a significant rise of attempts in 6th
grade.  (Journal of Adolescent Health via
Family
Matters, 2011).


Primary predictors of suicide include
hopelessness and depression.  (Association of
Physicians, 2004).

Higher Hope corresponds to greater emotional and
psychological well-being, greater academic performance, and enhanced personal
relationships (Snyder, 2005).
We were appalled when discovering these startling statistics.  And then we found out that the Google autofill for ""School makes me..."" is depressed.Please help us TEACH HOPE as there is no excuse for suicide in grade school.

</p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Hello, my name is Konstantin Dmitriev. I am running this campaign to fund the development of <a href=""http://www.synfig.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Synfig</a> - the free and opensource animation software.</p><p>I am mentoring a full-time developer Ivan Mahonin, who is working on Synfig code. We have funded his work in previous months by running similar fundraising campaigns in <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/526647"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">September</a>, <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/560551"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">October</a> and <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/579973"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">November</a>. <br/></p><p>Thanks to success of those campaigns, Ivan have implemented following features for Synfig:<br/></p><p><b>- Single-Window UI</b><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLzkBuNSCVI?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><b>- Bones tools</b><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHGFduXRiw8?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJrhHuXROY0?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><br/><p></p><p>The success of this campaign will allow Ivan to work full-time for a whole month in January 2014.<br/></p><p>Also, this campaign allows our users to directly influence the Synfig development by choosing development priorities.  <br/></p><p>How?</p><p>Please read below. <br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>""Choose Priority"" perk</h3>
<p>For
 a donation of fixed amount (see the perks on the right)  we offer to the donor an exceptional privilege to 
choose a priority of development.  So, we will spend next month working on the priority you defined.  Of course, we can't promise <i>any</i> thing, so please select from the list below:</p><ul>
<li>Frame-by-frame animation support (bitmap only)</li>
<li>Sound support</li>
<li>Fix bugs and work towards releasing the stable version<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>NOTE: We don't guarantee the feature from a selected priority to be <i>completely</i> <i>finished</i>
 within a month. Such promises are not compatible with development 
realities. What we promise is to dedicate no less than 85% of our 
working time to developing this priority for a full month. Though, one 
month is a  significant period and such dedication would lead to 
significant changes in selected direction. Many our users are aware that
 we used to publish <a href=""http://www.synfig.org/cms/en/download/development"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">development snapshots</a> regularly, so you will be able to benefit from development results as soon as possible.</p><p>EXAMPLE: As result of our earlier fundraising campaign, we got sold the ""Choose priority"" perk for October. The priority chosen by donor was ""Single-window UI"". You can see results in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLzkBuNSCVI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this video</a>.</p><h3>""Development OS"" perk</h3><p>By default we use Linux operation system (OS) for daily development (because we love Linux). As result, the Linux version of Synfig is the most polished, because it goes through daily proof.</p><p>But, for a fixed-amount donation (see the perks on the right) you can make us shift to other OS for next month. So, if we will use the OS of your choice in our daily development, then obviously  the Synfig version will be especially polished to work on it: daily proof =&gt; more testing =&gt; less bugs =&gt; better stability.</p><p>No worries, this perk doesn't mean we drop support for other operation systems. It's just a question of choosing the OS for daily development.<br/><br/>At the moment the only OS available for choice is Windows.</p>
<h3>Other perks</h3>
<p>We understand that there are people who would like to support our efforts by other means. 
Specially for them we prepared other perks to express our gratitude:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Tutorial video.</b> A tutorial video about Synfig for ANY given 
theme. Length is limited to 5 minutes.  Languages can be English or 
Russian. Video will be publicly available for everyone. The tutorial 
video will be produced by Nikolai Mamashev, who was in charge for producing <a href=""http://www.synfig.org/cms/en/news/the-first-synfig-training-package-is-available/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Synfig Training Package</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>Report sponsor.</b> You can track the progress of the development by reading <a href=""http://www.synfig.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=34"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my weekly reports</a>. If you claim this perk, then one of my weekly reports will be indicated as 
sponsored by you with an (optional) link to your website. The mention 
will look as ""This report is sponsored by: ..."" text at the top of the 
report text.</li>
<li>
<b>Sponsor logo.</b> Your logo displayed for one month at the front page of <a href=""http://synfig.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Synfig website</a>.<br/>
</li>
</ul><h3>How much do we need?</h3>
<p>Our monthly funding amount is $1300, but the goal is set to $1245 because we have extra $55 collected from our <a href=""http://igg.me/at/synfig-december-2013/x/2188395"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previous campaign</a>.<br/></p><p>It could happen that the campaign will go beyond the target goal, so I would like to outline the important funding milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1245 is enough to fund our work until February 1st, 2014</li>
<li>$25<span class=""notranlsate"">45 - until March 1st, 2014.</span>

Please check it out here.

Short SummaryHello, my name is Konstantin Dmitriev. I am running this campaign to fund the development of Synfig - the free and opensource animation software.I am mentoring a full-time developer Ivan Mahonin, who is working on Synfig code. We have funded his work in previous months by running similar fundraising campaigns in September, October and November. Thanks to success of those campaigns, Ivan have implemented following features for Synfig:- Single-Window UI- Bones toolsThe success of this campaign will allow Ivan to work full-time for a whole month in January 2014.Also, this campaign allows our users to directly influence the Synfig development by choosing development priorities.  How?Please read below. ""Choose Priority"" perk
For
 a donation of fixed amount (see the perks on the right)  we offer to the donor an exceptional privilege to 
choose a priority of development.  So, we will spend next month working on the priority you defined.  Of course, we can't promise any thing, so please select from the list below:
Frame-by-frame animation support (bitmap only)
Sound support
Fix bugs and work towards releasing the stable version

NOTE: We don't guarantee the feature from a selected priority to be completely finished
 within a month. Such promises are not compatible with development 
realities. What we promise is to dedicate no less than 85% of our 
working time to developing this priority for a full month. Though, one 
month is a  significant period and such dedication would lead to 
significant changes in selected direction. Many our users are aware that
 we used to publish development snapshots regularly, so you will be able to benefit from development results as soon as possible.EXAMPLE: As result of our earlier fundraising campaign, we got sold the ""Choose priority"" perk for October. The priority chosen by donor was ""Single-window UI"". You can see results in this video.""Development OS"" perkBy default we use Linux operation system (OS) for daily development (because we love Linux). As result, the Linux version of Synfig is the most polished, because it goes through daily proof.But, for a fixed-amount donation (see the perks on the right) you can make us shift to other OS for next month. So, if we will use the OS of your choice in our daily development, then obviously  the Synfig version will be especially polished to work on it: daily proof => more testing => less bugs => better stability.No worries, this perk doesn't mean we drop support for other operation systems. It's just a question of choosing the OS for daily development.At the moment the only OS available for choice is Windows.
Other perks
We understand that there are people who would like to support our efforts by other means. 
Specially for them we prepared other perks to express our gratitude:


Tutorial video. A tutorial video about Synfig for ANY given 
theme. Length is limited to 5 minutes.  Languages can be English or 
Russian. Video will be publicly available for everyone. The tutorial 
video will be produced by Nikolai Mamashev, who was in charge for producing Synfig Training Package.

Report sponsor. You can track the progress of the development by reading my weekly reports. If you claim this perk, then one of my weekly reports will be indicated as 
sponsored by you with an (optional) link to your website. The mention 
will look as ""This report is sponsored by: ..."" text at the top of the 
report text.

Sponsor logo. Your logo displayed for one month at the front page of Synfig website.

How much do we need?
Our monthly funding amount is $1300, but the goal is set to $1245 because we have extra $55 collected from our previous campaign.It could happen that the campaign will go beyond the target goal, so I would like to outline the important funding milestones:

$1245 is enough to fund our work until February 1st, 2014
$2545 - until March 1st, 2014.

$3845 - until April 1st, 2014.
$5145 - until May 1st, 2014.

Some of the ways we are looking to Branch Out include working with Local Farms, delivering educational resources to the public, creating Whole Family outdoor retreats, continuing to provide educational resources in local schools, and grow our thriving Summer Program.Help us share our passion...We currently run on a shoe string budget and are active in many communities. Although we have been extremely resourceful, this work does come with a great price, and we need funding to support our extensive efforts. Every expansion requires an investment. At this moment we are a State non-profit, based in Portland, Oregon. We are in the process of becoming a 501(c)(3) federal non-profit. Your greatly appreciated donations will not be tax deductible, but will reach children and garden educators in the Portland Area. Your vital contributions will help us become a federal non-profit, allowing us to branch out and reach even more communities. You'll make our dream a reality.Thank You~Please check out our blog to learn more.earthartag.blogspot.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Grayson and I am 14 years old. I attend the Lab School of Washington which is a unique and fantastic school for kids with learning disabilities (in my case, dyslexia). My school understands that kids like me learn differently and one of the ways they teach is through experiential learning. In the last few years, Lab has offered a travel program to kids who are interviewed and then approved to go on these trips. This year, the trip is to South Africa. It will be my first trip outside the United States. </p>
<p>I feel that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is an educational tour of the country and I will learn a lot. Some of the things we will learn about and visit while we are there are: </p>

<p>I am asking friends and relatives to help me reach my goal of funding my trip. I will learn more about this part of the world than I ever could by reading about it in a book. By going to the actual location, I will understand how it feels to be a part of the history, it will be more real to me and I will see with my own eyes the magnitude of the events that took place there.

<p>Hello Friends, Family, &amp; World</p>
<p>The experiences we encounter in life shape who we are.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, arts education in New York City schools has declined due to government produced budget cuts. What was once a requirement to enhance the development of our children is near extinction.</p>
<p>“Between 2006 and 2013, spending on arts supplies and equipment dropped by 84 percent,” as stated in a report released by Scott M. Stringer, NYC’s comptroller.</p>
<p>The report found 28 percent of schools lack a full-time certified arts teacher, 20 percent have no arts teacher at all, and 10 percent of NYC schools do not have a classroom devoted to art.</p>
<p>With a 47 percent decline in arts programming funding, there is an opportunity for you to step outside yourself and play an active role in the lives of our youth. Without creativity the world’s greatest innovations would cease to exist. </p>
<p>My name is Tuso Z. Boothe and I will be hosting an arts education fundraiser this August 2014. The goal is to raise at least $2,000 by August 2, 2014. 
		
	
	
		</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Proceeds from the event will be donated to Rush Philanthropic Art Foundation. </p>
<p></p>
</div>

</div></div>","Hello Friends, Family, & World
The experiences we encounter in life shape who we are.
Over the last few years, arts education in New York City schools has declined due to government produced budget cuts. What was once a requirement to enhance the development of our children is near extinction.
“Between 2006 and 2013, spending on arts supplies and equipment dropped by 84 percent,” as stated in a report released by Scott M. Stringer, NYC’s comptroller.
The report found 28 percent of schools lack a full-time certified arts teacher, 20 percent have no arts teacher at all, and 10 percent of NYC schools do not have a classroom devoted to art.
With a 47 percent decline in arts programming funding, there is an opportunity for you to step outside yourself and play an active role in the lives of our youth. Without creativity the world’s greatest innovations would cease to exist. 
My name is Tuso Z. Boothe and I will be hosting an arts education fundraiser this August 2014. The goal is to raise at least $2,000 by August 2, 2014. 
		
	
	
		




Proceeds from the event will be donated to Rush Philanthropic Art Foundation. 


The future of creativity is in our hands. We stifle the voices of our youth by cutting the arts education budget in our schools. It is with pure humility I call you to action to support this movement.

illness increased in the past few years. She tried to live a normal life –
having a job, relationships, and friends. But her mind betrayed her. </p>
<p>Her manic episodes started to be become more severe, and her
depression episode brought her to try and take her own life 3 times in the past
2 years. She has been hospitalized and medicated for the most part of the past
years. Her life stopped completely. </p>
<p>We don’t have much. Our family business went bankrupt,
leaving us with barely enough to exist. Me and my husband both work 2 jobs and
do everything we possibly can to help our daughter. But bills are high, so high
we can’t keep her hospitalized and give her the care she needs. </p>
<p>Her friends disappeared, she can’t keep even a part-time job
and her boyfriend is long gone. </p>
<p>I’m scared for the life of my girl. She’s almost 30years old
with no future ahead. I’m scared every time I open the front door in fear I’d
find her laying there lifeless. </p>

<p><strong>LOVE YOU ALL!</strong></p></div>","HELP GET JASE TO SOUTH AFRICA.
In January I am beginning a crazy adventure, an adventure I would love to invite you to take part in. I'm excited to share that I will be moving to Cape Town, South Africa along side a dozen or so other missionary friends of mine. Our hope is to embrace the beauty of the gospel and create a faith community in the margins of Cape Town that resonates love. The start of this adventure begins the end of October when I will accompany our community plant leader on a scouting trip to the Cape.
This initial trip is two fold.
FIRST - it serves as an opportunity to scope out the landscape, build relationships, and lay roots into a lot of the logistics for moving to South Africa long-term.
SECONDLY - we will be teaching and serving in a week long YWAM Humanities School in South Africa.

inside the progress and achievements:</p>
<p>• He can
discover the Application before everyone as a beta-tester</p>
<p>• His comments
will be considered in a special way, and he can help us make a more efficient
and user-friendly solution.</p>
<p>• He will be
regularly informed of the evolution of the network; he will be able to
contribute to strengthen its development.</p>
<p>• He can
interact with all the other members of the network, to share his experiences of
the earthquake and learn best practices.</p>
<p>Starting with
the campaign of crowdfunding, he will be invited to play an active role as an
ambassador of the network to make it known.</p>
<p>The donor is the
QuakeShare's partner. He provides financial and moral support, guarantee of our
success. It will therefore actually save lives.</p><p></p><p>               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/571457/files/20140511044949-Onde_01.jpg?1399808989"" src="""" style=""width: 428.602px; height: 121px;""/></p>

designs reliable and innovative devices to structure and share critical data in
the event of environmental catastrophes.</p>
<p>These
devices allow:</p>
<p>• to
save lives by providing real-time critical information on geolocation and
status of victims or witnesses.</p>
<p>• to
mobilize faster and better act collectively in real time for all actors
involved in crisis management</p>

<p>Pierre-Marie
Sarant is the founder Chairman of the company. He worked for more than 30 years
in more than 50 countries during humanitarian crises and natural disasters,
including 14 earthquakes. His experience led him to two conclusions: firstly,
the lack of scientific knowledge and sharing of critical information; secondly,
the under-utilization of digital technologies.</p>
<p>That
is why he has favored the new technologies and is surrounded by a
multidisciplinary team of experts: geophysics, telecommunications and networks,
new technologies, geographical information system, geography, risk education,
emergency medicine, occupational health...</p><p></p>
<hr align=""center"" width=""60%""/><h2><b><b>Why is the QuakeShare Network necessary?</b></b></h2><p></p><p>We designed QuakeShare, the global
solidarity-based earthquake alert network taking into account lessons learned
in individual and collective behavior, either during seismic events, during
crisis management or on longer-term in affected areas. </p>
<p>Feedbacks have also been gathered from other
alert systems, their use and population needs. </p>
<p>The QuakeShare network aims to cover the
gaps and to meet the needs identified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• <b>Ea</b><b>rthquakes prevention still has limitations.</b>
Nobody knows where exactly the next major earthquake will strike. But we know
that each year there are more than 150 potentially destructive earthquakes. </p>
<p><b>• Early warning systems are
insufficient.</b> Their
equipments are very expensive. The alert struggles to reach all people
concerned. Seismic zones fully supervised are rare.</p>
<p><b>• The seismic risk is complex and the
level of preparedness of the population is still very low.</b> Affected populations have rarely
benefited from the lessons learned in previous earthquakes.</p>
<p>• <b>The mobilization of emergency teams is
still too slow given the difficulties in reaching the victims.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>• Today 530 million people live in
known earthquake zones.</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/571436/files/20140511041911-mappemonde__.jpg?1399807151"" src="""" style=""""/>   </p><b>

<p>Pierre-Marie Sarant est le
Président fondateur de la société. Il est intervenu depuis plus de 30 ans dans
plus de 50 pays à l'occasion de crises humanitaires et de catastrophes
naturelles, dont 14 séismes. Son expérience l'a amené à un double constat :
d'une part, le manque de partage de connaissances scientifiques et
d'informations critiques ; d'autre part la sous-utilisation des technologies
numériques.</p>
<p>C'est pourquoi il a
privilégié les nouvelles technologies et s'est entouré d'une équipe d'experts
pluridisciplinaire : géophysique, télécommunications et réseaux, nouvelles
technologies, système d'informations géographiques, géographie, éducation aux
risques, médecine d'urgence, santé au travail...<br/></p>

<h2><b>Pourquoi le Réseau QuakeShare est nécessaire ?</b></h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>Nous avons conçu le Réseau QuakeShare d'alerte sismique mondial et
solidaire en tenant compte des retours d’expérience sur les comportements
individuels et collectifs, que ce soit pendant les secousses sismiques, dans la
gestion de la crise ou à plus long terme dans les zones concernées.</p><p></p><p>Des leçons ont été tirées des autres systèmes d’alerte, de leur
usage et des besoins des populations.</p>
<p>Le réseau QuakeShare a pour objectif de couvrir ces
manques et répondre aux besoins identifiés.</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<b>La prévention des séismes a encore des limites.</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Personne ne peut savoir où se produira
     précisément le prochain séisme majeur. Mais on sait que chaque année il y
     a plus de 150 séismes potentiellement destructeurs.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<b>Les systèmes d’alerte
     sont insuffisants. </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Leurs équipements sont très onéreux. L'alerte peine
     à atteindre toutes les personnes concernées. Les zones sismiques
     totalement surveillées sont rares.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<b>Le risque sismique est
     complexe et le niveau de préparation des populations est encore très
     faible. </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Les
     populations sinistrées ont rarement bénéficié des enseignements tirés de
     séismes précédents. </span>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><b>La mobilisation des secours est encore trop lente face aux
     difficultés à atteindre les victimes. </b></li>
</ul><p></p>
<ul><li><b>Aujourd’hui 530 millions de personnes vivent dans des zones
     sismiques connues.</b></li></ul><p>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/571436/files/20140511041911-mappemonde__.jpg?1399807151"" src="""" style=""width: 548px; height: 312px;""/><span style=""font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">    <br/><br/></span></p><b></b><p>

Why a crowdfunding campaign?
The QuakeShare
network is a new warning system for earthquakes. This system is intended to
operate worldwide and alert people through their smartphones from the first
seconds of the earthquake, that is to say before the telecommunications
networks are disrupted or damaged.
Today only the
most developed areas (California, Japan) have targeted warning systems. With
new digital technologies (networks and phones) available anywhere in the world,
we want to make this solution available to the greatest number. Lives can be
saved!          The QuakeShare
App, installed on smartphones, will trigger an alert when an earthquake hits,
understandable regardless of the language of the user. It will provide him his
location in relation to the event. 
Smartphones
close to the epicenter serve as sentinels for the network. Others, more
distant, will be alerted before the arrival of the earthquake. They will save
precious seconds to get to safety and reduce risk.
The QuakeShare network will alert emergency
teams from the first seconds of the earthquake. It will provide them with
real-time mapping of the victims. Emergency teams will save valuable time to
react in a situation where previously they would have had no information. 
QuakeShare App
users can reassure their loved ones and know their status. They can contribute
effectively to aid by informing on damage, on victims and on the evolution of
the situation on the ground. 
Before the
earthquake, they can prepare themselves in a fun and realistic way.                                          We wish to fund
the development of the QuakeShare Network through crowdfunding.
By building it
together, we preserve our independence and we guarantee its global
availability. 
We conducted
preliminary studies in geophysics, level and sensitivity of sensors embedded in
smartphones. We need to finalize the research on smartphones and build and
optimize all the technical elements of the solution. Your donations will help
to accomplish the core elements essential to the operation of the network.
The QuakeShare Application will be downloadable from GooglePlay
                                                        
To Whom is QuakeShare for?QuakeShare is
intended, first, to people living, working or traveling in a seismic zone, for
work or personal travel, leisure and tourism; and, secondly, to people wanting
to support the most exposed populations to earthquakes.                                   
What is the role of the donor?The donor is the
founder of the alert network. The solidarity he demonstrates by sponsoring the
first areas of deployment of the network, is a tremendous help for the more
vulnerable in front of earthquakes.
He has the
privilege of living the adventure of creating the network, following from the
inside the progress and achievements:
• He can
discover the Application before everyone as a beta-tester
• His comments
will be considered in a special way, and he can help us make a more efficient
and user-friendly solution.
• He will be
regularly informed of the evolution of the network; he will be able to
contribute to strengthen its development.
• He can
interact with all the other members of the network, to share his experiences of
the earthquake and learn best practices.
Starting with
the campaign of crowdfunding, he will be invited to play an active role as an
ambassador of the network to make it known.
The donor is the
QuakeShare's partner. He provides financial and moral support, guarantee of our
success. It will therefore actually save lives.               
Who develops QuakeShare?QuakeShare
is developed by CynSIS SAS, based in France.                                  CynSIS
designs reliable and innovative devices to structure and share critical data in
the event of environmental catastrophes.
These
devices allow:
• to
save lives by providing real-time critical information on geolocation and
status of victims or witnesses.
• to
mobilize faster and better act collectively in real time for all actors
involved in crisis management
•
and before that to prepare well
We
are supported by the French Public Investment Bank, the European Space Agency
(ESA), INRIA, PACA-Est Incubator, the Urban Community of Sophia Antipolis (06),
EURECOM, the BA06 Event, and other private partners.
Pierre-Marie
Sarant is the founder Chairman of the company. He worked for more than 30 years
in more than 50 countries during humanitarian crises and natural disasters,
including 14 earthquakes. His experience led him to two conclusions: firstly,
the lack of scientific knowledge and sharing of critical information; secondly,
the under-utilization of digital technologies.
That
is why he has favored the new technologies and is surrounded by a
multidisciplinary team of experts: geophysics, telecommunications and networks,
new technologies, geographical information system, geography, risk education,
emergency medicine, occupational health...
Why is the QuakeShare Network necessary?We designed QuakeShare, the global
solidarity-based earthquake alert network taking into account lessons learned
in individual and collective behavior, either during seismic events, during
crisis management or on longer-term in affected areas. 
Feedbacks have also been gathered from other
alert systems, their use and population needs. 
The QuakeShare network aims to cover the
gaps and to meet the needs identified.

• Earthquakes prevention still has limitations.
Nobody knows where exactly the next major earthquake will strike. But we know
that each year there are more than 150 potentially destructive earthquakes. 
• Early warning systems are
insufficient. Their
equipments are very expensive. The alert struggles to reach all people
concerned. Seismic zones fully supervised are rare.
• The seismic risk is complex and the
level of preparedness of the population is still very low. Affected populations have rarely
benefited from the lessons learned in previous earthquakes.
• The mobilization of emergency teams is
still too slow given the difficulties in reaching the victims.

• Today 530 million people live in
known earthquake zones.   

More information about QuakeShare
The new possibilities offered by digital
technologies, the increasing coverage of the majority of seismic zones by
mobile telecommunication networks, the accelerated acceptance of smartphones
globally offers unique opportunities to reduce the impact of earthquakes. 
In 2013, 1 billion smartphones were sold
worldwide, causing a rapid increase in penetration rate.  
Android market share is 78.6% or 794 million
smartphones sold. (Source: IDC)
What are the funding needs to activate the QuakeShare Network?With your donations we will gradually develop the QuakeShare App version 1 can be delivered in January 2015.  The more donations we receive, the more quickly the versions will enrich.

How and when will be distributed the rewardsThe QuakeShare App will be available before end January 2015, and donors will be individually informed. They will receive the installation and activation approach for their Apps, based on the number associated with their contribution.For the distribution of the
applications in seismic areas, Cynsis will be supported by recognized
organizations working with forgotten people to prepare for major natural risks
and who have the means to conduct simulation exercises and training of the
population. It will be a support to a program previously organized.The thanks-you on the App
QuakeShare will appear from the publication of the first version.The thanks-you Thanks on
Facebook and the logos of donor organizations will be published on Cynsis
website from the formalization of the donation.
The training days will be
scheduled after the campaign.

QuakeShare, le réseau d'alerte aux séismes, mondial et solidaire

Pourquoi une campagne de crowdfunding (financement participatif) ?
Le réseau QuakeShare est un nouveau système d’alerte pour les séismes. Ce
système a vocation à fonctionner partout dans le monde et à alerter les
populations à travers leurs smartphones, dès les premières secondes du séisme,
c’est-à-dire avant que les réseaux de télécommunications ne soient perturbés ou
endommagés.
Aujourd’hui seules les zones les plus
développées (Californie, Japon) disposent de systèmes ciblés d'alerte. Grâce
aux nouvelles technologies numériques (réseaux et téléphones) disponibles
partout dans le monde, nous voulons mettre cette solution à disposition du plus
grand nombre. Des vies peuvent être épargnées !                                                                   

L'App QuakeShare, installée sur les
smartphones, permettra de déclencher une alerte face aux séismes, compréhensible quelle que soit la
langue de l'utilisateur. Elle lui permettra de se localiser par rapport à
l’évènement.              Les smartphones les plus proches de
l'épicentre serviront de sentinelles pour le réseau. Les autres, plus éloignés,
seront alertés avant même l'arrivée du séisme. Ils permettront de gagner de
précieuses secondes pour se mettre en sécurité et réduire leur risques.                    Le réseau QuakeShare alertera les secours dès les premières secondes du séisme. Il leur fournira une cartographie en temps réel des sinistrés. Les secours gagneront un temps précieux pour porter assistance dans une situation où antérieurement ils n'auraient disposé d'aucune information.   Les utilisateurs de l'App QuakeShare
pourront rassurer leurs proches et connaître leur situation. Ils
pourront contribuer
efficacement aux secours en informant sur les dégâts, sur les victimes et sur
l'évolution de la situation sur le terrain.
Avant le séisme, ils pourront se
préparer de manière ludique et réaliste.                                                                                               Nous souhaitons financer le
développement du réseau QuakeShare grâce au crowdfunding. 
En le bâtissant ensemble nous préservons
notre indépendance et nous garantissons son fonctionnement mondial.Nous avons réalisé les études
préliminaires au niveau géophysique et sur la sensibilité des capteurs
embarqués dans les smartphones. Nous devons finaliser les recherches sur les
smartphones et construire, puis optimiser l’ensemble des éléments techniques de
la solution. Vos dons permettront ainsi de réaliser les éléments centraux,
indispensables au fonctionnement du réseau.



L’application QuakeShare sera téléchargeable sur GooglePlay

A qui s'adresse QuakeShare ?QuakeShare s'adresse, d'une part, à
toute personne vivant, travaillant ou se déplaçant en zone sismique, dans le
cadre professionnel ou personnel, pour les loisirs ou le tourisme ; et, d'autre part, à toute personne
voulant aider les populations les plus exposées face aux séismes.                                   

Quel est le rôle du donateur ?Le donateur est fondateur du réseau
d’alerte. La solidarité qu'il témoigne en sponsorisant les premières zones de
déploiement du réseau est une aide extraordinaire pour les plus démunis face
aux séismes.
Il a le privilège de vivre l'aventure de
la création du réseau, de suivre de l'intérieur les avancées et les
réussites :

Il pourra découvrir l'Application avant tout le monde, en tant
     que beta-testeur
Ses commentaires seront pris en compte de manière privilégiée,
     et nous aidera à rendre la solution plus efficace et plus conviviale.
Il sera informé régulièrement de l'évolution du réseau, pourra
     contribuer à renforcer son développement.
Il pourra échanger avec tous les autres membres du
     réseau : partager son expérience du tremblement de terre ou apprendre
     les bonnes pratiques.
Dès l'opération de crowdfunding, il est
invité à jouer un rôle actif d'ambassadeur du réseau en le faisant connaître.

Le donateur est le partenaire de QuakeShare.
Il fournit un support financier et moral, gage de notre réussite. Il aidera
donc concrètement à sauver des vies.                        
Qui développe QuakeShare ?QuakeShare est développé par la société CynSIS, basée en France.                                   
CynSIS conçoit des
dispositifs fiables et innovants pour structurer et partager des données
vitales en cas de catastrophe environnementale.Ces dispositifs permettent : 
De
     sauver des vies en fournissant en temps réel des informations cruciales
     sur la géolocalisation et l'état des personnes victimes ou témoins.
À l'ensemble des acteurs impliqués
     dans la gestion d'une crise, de se mobiliser plus rapidement et de mieux
     agir collectivement en temps réel.
Et avant cela de bien se préparer.

Nous sommes soutenus par la
Banque Publique française d’Investissement, l’Agence Spatiale Européenne (ESA),
l'INRIA, l’Incubateur PACA-Est, la Communauté d’Agglomération de Sophia
Antipolis (06), EURECOM, le BA06 Event, et d'autres partenaires privés.
Pierre-Marie Sarant est le
Président fondateur de la société. Il est intervenu depuis plus de 30 ans dans
plus de 50 pays à l'occasion de crises humanitaires et de catastrophes
naturelles, dont 14 séismes. Son expérience l'a amené à un double constat :
d'une part, le manque de partage de connaissances scientifiques et
d'informations critiques ; d'autre part la sous-utilisation des technologies
numériques.
C'est pourquoi il a
privilégié les nouvelles technologies et s'est entouré d'une équipe d'experts
pluridisciplinaire : géophysique, télécommunications et réseaux, nouvelles
technologies, système d'informations géographiques, géographie, éducation aux
risques, médecine d'urgence, santé au travail...


Pourquoi le Réseau QuakeShare est nécessaire ?
Nous avons conçu le Réseau QuakeShare d'alerte sismique mondial et
solidaire en tenant compte des retours d’expérience sur les comportements
individuels et collectifs, que ce soit pendant les secousses sismiques, dans la
gestion de la crise ou à plus long terme dans les zones concernées.Des leçons ont été tirées des autres systèmes d’alerte, de leur
usage et des besoins des populations.
Le réseau QuakeShare a pour objectif de couvrir ces
manques et répondre aux besoins identifiés.

La prévention des séismes a encore des limites. Personne ne peut savoir où se produira
     précisément le prochain séisme majeur. Mais on sait que chaque année il y
     a plus de 150 séismes potentiellement destructeurs.



Les systèmes d’alerte
     sont insuffisants. Leurs équipements sont très onéreux. L'alerte peine
     à atteindre toutes les personnes concernées. Les zones sismiques
     totalement surveillées sont rares.



Le risque sismique est
     complexe et le niveau de préparation des populations est encore très
     faible. Les
     populations sinistrées ont rarement bénéficié des enseignements tirés de
     séismes précédents. 


La mobilisation des secours est encore trop lente face aux
     difficultés à atteindre les victimes. 

Aujourd’hui 530 millions de personnes vivent dans des zones
     sismiques connues.           
Plus d'information à propos de QuakeShareLes nouvelles possibilités offertes par les technologies numériques, la couverture de plus en plus forte par les réseaux de télécommunications mobiles de la majorité des zones sismiques, l'acceptation accélérée des smartphones par la population mondiale offrent des possibilités uniques pour réduire l'impact des séismes.En 2013, 1 milliard de smartphones ont été vendus dans le monde, amenant une progression rapide des taux de pénétration. La part de marché d'Android est de 78,6% soit 794 Millions de smartphones vendus.(source IDC)

QuakeShare, la red solidaria y global de alerta de terremotos 
¿Porque una campaña de crowdfunding?La red QuakeShare es un nuevo sistema de alerta
de terremotos. Este sistema está diseñado para operar en todo el mundo y alertar
a la población a través de sus teléfonos móviles, desde los primeros segundos
del terremoto, es decir, antes de que las redes de telecomunicaciones se rompan
o se dañan.
Hoy en día sólo las
zonas más desarrolladas (California, Japón) disponen de sistemas de alerta
específicos. Gracias a las nuevas tecnologías digitales (redes y móviles)
disponibles en cualquier lugar del mundo, queremos poner esta solución
disponible para el mayor número de personas. Se pueden salvar vidas!                    La App QuakeShare instalado en los teléfonos
móviles, permitirá dispar una alerta de terremoto, comprensible,
independientemente del idioma del usuario. Esta app le permitirá localizar su
posición en relación al terremoto. 
Los smartphones más
cercanos al epicentro servirán como centinelas para la red. Los otros, más
lejanos, será alertados incluso antes de la llegada del terremoto. Permitirán
ganar unos segundos preciosos para ponerse a salvo y reducir su riesgo.
La red QuakeShare alertará a los equipos de
emergencias desde los primeros segundos del terremoto. Les proporcionará mapas
en tiempo real de las víctimas. Los equipos de emergencia ganarán un valioso
tiempo para ayudar en una situación en la que anteriormente no hubieran tenido
ninguna información. 
Los usuarios de la
aplicación QuakeShare podrán tranquilizar a sus seres queridos y conocer su
estado. Podrán también contribuir eficazmente a ayudar a los equipos de
emergencia informando  de los daños, las
víctimas y la evolución de la situación sobre el terreno. 
Antes del
terremoto, se podrán preparar de forma lúdica y realista.                                                                                     Nos gustaría
financiar el desarrollo de la red QuakeShare a través de crowdfunding. 
Construyéndola
juntos preservamos nuestra independencia y garantizamos su funcionamiento
global.

Hemos llevado a cabo
estudios preliminares a nivel geofísico y sobre la sensibilidad de los sensores
incorporados en los smartphones. Tenemos que concluir la investigación sobre
los smartphones y optimizar el conjunto de los elementos técnicos de la
solución. 
Vuestras donaciones
permitirán finalizar los elementos centrales, indispensables para el
funcionamiento de la red.
La Aplicación QuakeShare se podrá descargar en GooglePlay
                                                   
¿A quien se dirige QuakeShare?QuakeShare se
dirige, por un lado, a cualquier persona que vive, trabaja o desplaza a una
zona sísmica, por motivos de trabajo o personal, por ocio o turismo; y, por
otro lado, a cualquier persona que quiera ayudar a hacer frente a los
terremotos a las poblaciones más vulnerables y expuestas.                                   
¿Cuál es el papel del donante?El donante es el
fundador de una red de alerta. La solidaridad que demuestra patrocinando las
primeras zonas de despliegue de la red es una gran ayuda para los más
vulnerables frente a los terremotos.
Tiene el privilegio
de vivir la aventura de la creación de la red,  de seguir desde dentro los progresos y logros:

Podrá descubrir la App antes que todo,s como beta-tester 
Sus comentarios serán tomados en cuenta de forma privilegiada, y nos
     ayudará a hacer la solución más eficiente y fácil de usar. 
Será informado periódicamente de la evolución de la red, podrá
     contribuir a fortalecer su desarrollo. 
Podrá interactuar con todos los otros miembros de la red, compartir
     sus experiencias del terremoto y aprender las mejores prácticas.
Tras la operación
de crowdfunding, será invitado a jugar un papel activo como embajador de la red
haciéndola conocer.
El donante es
‘miembro’ de QuakeShare. Proporciona apoyo financiero y moral, garantía de
nuestro éxito. Ayudará, por tanto, en realidad salvar vidas.
¿Quien desarrolla QuakeShare?QuakeShare
es desarrollado por la empresa CynSIS, con sede en Francia.                                      CynSIS
diseña dispositivos fiables e innovadores para estructurar y compartir datos
vitales en caso de una catástrofe medioambiental. 
Estos
dispositivos permiten: 
• Salvar
vidas proporcionando en tiempo real información crucial sobre la
geolocalización y el estado de las víctimas o los testigos.
• Para
todos los actores involucrados en la gestión de una crisis, movilizarse más
rápido y actuar mejor colectivamente en tiempo real 
• Y
antes, prepararse bien.
Nos
apoyan el Banco de Inversión Pública francés, la Agencia Espacial Europea
(ESA), INRIA, la Incubadora PACA-Est, la Comunidad de Sophia Antipolis (06), EURECOM,
el BA06 Event, y otros socios privados.
Pierre-Marie
Sarant es el presidente fundador de la empresa. Intervino durante más de 30
años en más de 50 países durante crisis humanitarias y desastres naturales,
incluidos 14 terremotos. Su experiencia lo llevó a dos conclusiones: en primer
lugar, la falta de intercambio de conocimiento científico y de información
crítica; Por otra parte, la subutilización de las tecnologías digitales. 
Por eso
ha privilegiado las nuevas tecnologías y se ha rodeado por un equipo
multidisciplinario de expertos: geofísica, telecomunicaciones y redes, nuevas
tecnologías, sistemas de información geográfica, geografía, educación sobre
riesgos, medicina de emergencia, salud laboral...
¿Porque es necesaria la red QuakeShare?Hemos diseñado la red QuakeShare de alerta
sísmica global y solidaria teniendo en cuenta la información recibida sobre
comportamiento individual y colectivo, ya sea durante los terremotos, en
situaciones de crisis y, a más largo plazo, en las áreas afectadas. 
Se han aprendido lecciones de otros sistemas
de alerta, su uso y de las necesidades de la población. 
La red QuakeShare tiene como objetivo cubrir
estas carencias  y responder a las
necesidades identificadas.· 
La
prevención de los terremotos aún tiene limitaciones. Nadie  puede saber dónde se producirá exactamente el
próximo gran terremoto. Pero sabemos que cada año hay más de 150 terremotos
potencialmente destructivos.
· 
Sistemas de alerta son insuficientes. Su equipo es muy caro. La alerta lucha para
llegar a todos los afectados. Las zonas sísmicas están totalmente supervisadas
​​son raras.
· 
El riesgo sísmico es complejo y el nivel de
preparación de la población es aún muy baja. Las poblaciones afectadas rara vez se han beneficiado de las lecciones
aprendidas de los terremotos anteriores. 
· 
La movilización de los equipos de emergencia sigue
siendo demasiado lento frente a las dificultades para llegar a las víctimas. 
· 
En la actualidad 530 millones de personas viven en
zonas sismicas conocidos.     

Más información acerca de QuakeShare
Las nuevas posibilidades que ofrecen las tecnologías
digitales, la cobertura cada vez más fuerte por las redes de telecomunicaciones
de la mayoría de zonas sísmicas, la rápida aceptación de los smartphones por la
población mundial, ofrecen oportunidades únicas para reducir el impacto de los
terremotos.

En 2013, se vendieron en todo el mundo 1000 millones de
smartphones, causando un rápido aumento de la tasa de penetración. La tasa de
mercado de Android es del 78,6% o 794 millones de smartphones vendidos (Fuente:
IDC).
¿Cuáles son las necesidades
de financiación para activar la red QuakeShare ?Con vuestras donaciones
desarrollaremos de forma progresiva la App QuakeShare. La versión 1 se podrá
entregar en enero de 2015. Cuantas más donaciones recibamos más rápido las versiones
serán más completas.

<p>Hello, My name is Josh Choi. I live in Geneva, Switzerland and work at ITU (International Telecommunication Union). This year I am launching an education project in a small town called Manastirea in Romania.</p>
<p>Manastirea is a small village with population of around 4,000 people, located in the province of Calarasi, 70km away from Bucharest, capital of Romania. 25% of population are gypsy people who have settled down at this town since around 1910's. Children aged from 3 to 12 are estimated around 600 and are living in a very poor education environment because of, firstly, lack of skilled teachers and secondly, premature marriage inherited from traditional gypsy culture, and finally lack of parents' interest in education for their children.<br/></p>
<p>Especially the premature marriage is a big barrier to the education. Many teenagers drop their study and got married and have many children when they are 14 to 15 years. As a result, when they become parents, as they were not educated well and very young and inexperienced, they don’t know what to do, even don't care of education for their children. This lack of interest obviously doesn't motivate the children to learn. And then a vicious circle starts again.</p>
<p>There is a small Christianity –based center in the town, which I have supported summer school program every year since 2010 on a voluntary basis. One of the goals of this center is to cut this vicious circle in this town by helping children from age of 3 access to proper education. Principal of the public school (including preschool) in the town asked the center to care for especially less motivated children through an after-school program which we are now developing. One part of the program will be to educate pre-school kids of basic math skill through self-study tools such as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/onebillionchildren"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Onebillion</a> app.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

</div></div>","Background 
Hello, My name is Josh Choi. I live in Geneva, Switzerland and work at ITU (International Telecommunication Union). This year I am launching an education project in a small town called Manastirea in Romania.
Manastirea is a small village with population of around 4,000 people, located in the province of Calarasi, 70km away from Bucharest, capital of Romania. 25% of population are gypsy people who have settled down at this town since around 1910's. Children aged from 3 to 12 are estimated around 600 and are living in a very poor education environment because of, firstly, lack of skilled teachers and secondly, premature marriage inherited from traditional gypsy culture, and finally lack of parents' interest in education for their children.
Especially the premature marriage is a big barrier to the education. Many teenagers drop their study and got married and have many children when they are 14 to 15 years. As a result, when they become parents, as they were not educated well and very young and inexperienced, they don’t know what to do, even don't care of education for their children. This lack of interest obviously doesn't motivate the children to learn. And then a vicious circle starts again.
There is a small Christianity –based center in the town, which I have supported summer school program every year since 2010 on a voluntary basis. One of the goals of this center is to cut this vicious circle in this town by helping children from age of 3 access to proper education. Principal of the public school (including preschool) in the town asked the center to care for especially less motivated children through an after-school program which we are now developing. One part of the program will be to educate pre-school kids of basic math skill through self-study tools such as Onebillion app.
   

What We Need  For this, I am now raising funds to purchase 10tablets (both iPad and Android tablet, new and second-handed) which children can play as their self-study tools at the center (not to be distributed to each child). 


Future 

I am not a genius guy like Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and inventors. However, I am sure normal people like me can also change the world by utilizing what they have - their skills, resources and networks. We don't need to be so smart as to invent something. There are already millions of apps, websites and other materials all around the world. What we need are passion, commitment and ability of curating those sources to be able to adapt to an area where our passion is dedicated. 
I believe 'big thinking' cannot change the world without 'small start'. This initiative is a small start for a big vision that all disadvantaged children have a proper access to the essential education in Romania and beyond. I wish you join this adventure and show yourself as an example of normal but change-making people!              
  


Risks & Challenges

 As I mentioned, parents in this village are not highly motivated to education for their children. Therefore, it is crucially important to convince the parents first. I would face skepticism and distrust of the parents at the beginning but will not give up and keep going to make changes.        



What we give you : 

Signage on the Center

Regular report on the activities of the Center and on learners' progress

Communication with the Center - teachers, volunteers and learners 
An opportunity for in-depth case studies



Other Ways You Can Help 
You can also provide an in-kind contribution : donation of your old tablets. 

I would really appreciate if you can spread out this campaign among your friends. Any advice or comments will also be highly welcomed! - if you have any relative experience, know an expert in this kind of field, or have any good ideas,",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

These girls will really have you LAUGH ART LOUD!Super SixYou will definitely BEE impressed by the ""Super Six!""  Their solution to the scientific challenge will have you buzzing!  Their Scientific Challenge, ""Going to Extremes,"" requires team members to explore an extreme environment and create extreme gear to live in that environment.  When Douglas shrinks himself with his science fair experiment, his whole world changes.  He is forced to find a way to adapt to the sticky situation.  How would you adapt to living in a bee hive?What We NeedIn order to attend Global Finals, we need to raise $7,535.  The cost covers lodging, meals, and events for ten team members and one team manager.  10 students X $685 = $6,8501 team manager @ $685Total:  $7,535What You GetFor every donation of $25 or more, the “Laughing Lollypops”

</div></div>","The Chance of a Life Time for Learning and
Healing 
I am a Master’s student in Drama Therapy at Concordia
University Montreal, QUEBEC. Drama therapy and all the creative Arts therapies
are at the essence of us all. We are creative beings improving our unique paths
through life. The Creative Arts allow us a unique tool with which to explore
our inner selves and transform our lives. As method used by therapists in many
settings for many years Drama therapy and Theatre have been used by many to
work in a new and empowering way to help heal wounds, and transform conflicts
and trauma within families, across cultures and between nations.
 
This June 2011, I will venture forward on a new
project and one of my deepest passions. 
I will join drama therapists and fellow students in urban and village
settings in Kenya and Uganda, where we will exchange knowledge and techniques
with African theatre practitioners, counselors, social workers, and other group
leaders who help heal and transform their communities.
 


THE PROJECT


Using applied theatre and drama therapy methods, our
work with community leaders will focus on several outcomes:
 
   In
Nairobi, Kenya, working with the Amani People's Theatre (http://www.aptkenya.org/whoweare.html) we will focus on street
children in remand homes
 
 
   In
Budondo village, Uganda, working with the Atua Theatre Troupe, Budondo Intercultural Center (http://budondo.wordpress.com), we will focus on women’s
reproductive health.
 
   In the
Great Rift Valley in northern Kenya, and villages near the coast of the Indian
Ocean, we will focus on preventing election-related violence
 
   In
Northern Uganda, we will focus on rehabilitating and healing trauma in
child soldiers after 20 years of war.
 
   Another group we will be
working with is the Rifiki Participatatory/Forum Theatre Troupe (http://www.rafiki-theatre.org).
 
PREPARATION
 Before our departure to Kenya and Uganda, I will
receive intensive training from the leadership for this service adventure. The
work will focus on theatre, movement and somatic practices. Using a combination
of practices and skills of all. During our work in East Africa we will hold
debriefing and reflection sessions after each phase. 
 
The mission of those who I will be joining is to find
the bridges between personal exploration and service to humanity. The leaders
will use their expertise in Theatre of the Oppressed, Developmental Transformations,
Playback Theatre, Psychodrama/ Sociodrama, Contact Improvisation and Authentic
Movement.
Since 2007 they have been collaborating with
African theatre practitioners in a cultural exchange. Together we will
be cultivating an approach that combines African and American perspectives on
personal and societal healing through the theatre arts.



THE TEAM
I will undertake this service with drama therapists
with significant experience in Kenya and Uganda, as well as significant
experience in Theatre of the Oppressed, Playback Theatre, Applied Theatre and
Developmental Transformations. Leading the trip will be the following:

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Hello,
and thank you for looking at the Winning Play$ financial literacy program
campaign!</p>
<p> First, I’ll give
you some background as to how the project came about.  I’ve been a
financial journalist for over 20 years.  That’s given me a unique vantage
point to see the ways in which people struggle with money.</p>
<p>Few things work as simply as money
right?  Don’t spend more than you have.  Don’t borrow more than you
can pay back.  Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. </p>
<p> In fact, when we have problems
with money, we go straight to the numbers:  Earn more, save more, spend
more, but there is clearly more to financial behavior than dollars and cents.</p>
<p> Money is one of the leading
causes of depression.  A leading cause of divorce, and one of the major
reasons people behave in ways that don’t reflect their true character.</p>
<p> Frustrated by the fact that I
could see from my own experiences and work that people could not create healthy
financial lives, in 2002, I embarked on what became a six-year study to find
out what’s really at work in our financial behavior.</p>
<p> The problems became clear, our
financial choices have very little to do with numbers.  I found that
social messages from advertisers and the media, stereotypes about race and
gender, as well as early role modeling, are among the primary drivers. </p>
<p> In 2008, I wrote a book based
on my research, “<b><i>The True Cost of Happiness:  The Real Story Behind
Managing Your Money,</i></b>” (publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons), which got a
great deal of media attention.</p>
<p>It caught the eye of
the White House and I was asked and created a financial education program for Historically
Black Colleges and Universities on behalf of the Oval office.  That’s when
my light bulb went off:  I found my passion to educate and expand the
conversation about money to include more than numbers.</p>
<p> In 2010, with the support of
Dr James Prochaska - named one of the five most influential authors in
Psychology by the Institute for Scientific Information and the American
Psychological Society - and NFL Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott and his All Stars
Helping Kids foundation, I used my research to create the Winning Play$
Financial Education Curriculum for high school and college students.  Over
500 participants in New York, Connecticut, Texas, and California have gone
through the program.  We were recently awarded a grant from the State of
Connecticut to implement Winning Play$ at a high school in Hartford, CT</p>
<p> Winning Play$ is also a
recipient of the United States Department of Education’s <i>Excellence in
Economic Education award</i> and the <i>National Association of Black
Journalist’s Community Service award.</i></p>
<p><b>About Winning Play$</b></p>
<p>Winning Play$ is built
to meet the Common Core math standards and the Jumpstart Coalition’s financial
education standards. <a href=""http://www.jumpstart.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.jumpstart.org/</span></a> 
    <br/></p>
<p>It is run as a full semester course or a workshop for high
school and college students in schools and community based organizations like
the YWCA and Girl Scouts.</p>
<p>Winning Play$ is a four-part program:</p>
<ol>
<li>We remind students of the skills they use every day
     that can be applied to smart decisions about money:  They
     problem-solve, they make choices, they perform under pressure. </li>
<li>Goals: We help them paint a picture of who they want to
     be and the life they want to live.  They see how money can support
     that journey.</li>
<li>We examine how things like media
     messages, gender and racial stereotypes, as well as uninformed
     role-modeling can lead to bad financial decisions. </li>
<li>Personal finance 101: Lessons on debt, saving,
     investing,  etc., all in the context that being financially literate
     can help students be who they want to be.  Understanding money is
     relevant.</li>
</ol>
<p> The program is
unique in that we measure its impact on behavior using Dr. Prochaska’s
Transtheoretical Behavior Change model.  <a href=""http://www.prochange.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.prochange.com/</span></a>.  We also provide teacher training, all
instructional materials, and tests.</p>
<p><b>What We Need and What You Get</b></p>
<p>Your contribution will help us make
an abbreviated 7 hour version of Winning Play$ for elementary, middle, and high
school students.  This will allow us to expand our current offering beyond
the full semester course or workshop for just high school and college students.</p>
<p>In addition, currently, our
evaluation is done on paper and mailed to our partners at Pro-Change to
process.  Your contribution will also help us create an online evaluation
tool that will make the process much more efficient and much less expensive!</p>
<p><b>Cost Breakdown</b></p>
<p>The costs for this
project fall into two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Curriculum Development</li>
<li>Evaluation System Development</li>
</ol>
<p>1.  Curriculum Development:
The Winning Play$ team will work our curriculum specialists to create: </p>
<ul>
<li>   7 hours of curriculum for High
     School.</li>
<li>   7 hours of curriculum for
     Middle School.</li>
<li> <span> 
     7 hours of curriculum for Elementary School. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Create Two 90 minute
parent/student workshops based on the program</p>
<p>We estimate our combined
costs for this part of the process to be $30,000.</p>
<p>2.  Evaluation System
Development:  Pro-Change Behavior Systems will work with our production
partner to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Develop Online Behavior Change
     assessment </li>
<li>Develop Reporting Feature (will allow data
     analysis to be automated)</li>
<li>Focus Groups with new age groups: 
     Cognitive testing and interviews with children ages 6 - 12   
                        
                        
                        
                        
          </li>
<li>Data
     Analysis 
                          
                    </li>
<li>Reporting 
      
      
      
      
      
        
              </li>
</ul>
<p>We estimate the costs
for this part of the process to be $35,000.</p>
<p>If we fall short of our
goal, we will use the funds we raise for curriculum development. 
Any excess with go towards funding the evaluation tool.</p>
<p><b><u>Impact</u></b></p>
<p>According to
the nation’s leading financial literacy research organization, <i>The Jumpstart
Coaltion</i>, American high school students got less than half of the answers
correct on a basic personal finance test.  Your support can help us start
a cycle of change in the lives of many that will not only affect those around
them, but give future generations the tools to make lasting change to their
financial behavior.</p>
<p><b><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></b></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in
developing a program like this is to find the right partnerships and to keep
the funding and manpower stream going.  One of the inspirations for this
project was demand:  Some of the school boards and community based
organizations that are currently using Winning Play$ have requested this
abbreviated version. In addition, we are forming new partnerships with groups
that plan to use this format in existing after school programs.  The
beauty of our online delivery is that very little manpower is needed with the exception
of initial orientation and program coordination.  We will continue to use
our team as well as our relationship with All Stars Helping Kids to insure
successful delivery of this abbreviated version.  </p>
<p><b>Praise from Gloria Steinem!</b></p>
<p>Icon Gloria Steinem was kind enough
to write a list of the “Top 10 reasons” she wishes she had gone through Winning
Play$!</p>
<p><b>MY TEN TOP REASONS FOR CELEBRATING
STACEY TISDALE’S PROGRAM!</b></p>
<p> -Gloria Steinem</p>
<p> 10. 85% of all women will be
solely responsible for their livelihood at some time in their lives.</p>
<p> 9.  Divorced women are
entitled to a spouse’s share of Social Security only if they were married ten
years or longer. The average length of marriage in the U.S. is 9.6 years.</p>
<p> 8. Women use health care more
than men do because of childbearing. The rate of uninsured women is growing
three times faster than the rate of uninsured men.</p>
<p> 7.  Advertisers target
women‘s insecurity about appearance. They do their photo-shopped best to keep

</div></div>","Summary
Hello,
and thank you for looking at the Winning Play$ financial literacy program
campaign!
 First, I’ll give
you some background as to how the project came about.  I’ve been a
financial journalist for over 20 years.  That’s given me a unique vantage
point to see the ways in which people struggle with money.
Few things work as simply as money
right?  Don’t spend more than you have.  Don’t borrow more than you
can pay back.  Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. 
 In fact, when we have problems
with money, we go straight to the numbers:  Earn more, save more, spend
more, but there is clearly more to financial behavior than dollars and cents.
 Money is one of the leading
causes of depression.  A leading cause of divorce, and one of the major
reasons people behave in ways that don’t reflect their true character.
 Frustrated by the fact that I
could see from my own experiences and work that people could not create healthy
financial lives, in 2002, I embarked on what became a six-year study to find
out what’s really at work in our financial behavior.
 The problems became clear, our
financial choices have very little to do with numbers.  I found that
social messages from advertisers and the media, stereotypes about race and
gender, as well as early role modeling, are among the primary drivers. 
 In 2008, I wrote a book based
on my research, “The True Cost of Happiness:  The Real Story Behind
Managing Your Money,” (publisher: John Wiley & Sons), which got a
great deal of media attention.
It caught the eye of
the White House and I was asked and created a financial education program for Historically
Black Colleges and Universities on behalf of the Oval office.  That’s when
my light bulb went off:  I found my passion to educate and expand the
conversation about money to include more than numbers.
 In 2010, with the support of
Dr James Prochaska - named one of the five most influential authors in
Psychology by the Institute for Scientific Information and the American
Psychological Society - and NFL Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott and his All Stars
Helping Kids foundation, I used my research to create the Winning Play$
Financial Education Curriculum for high school and college students.  Over
500 participants in New York, Connecticut, Texas, and California have gone
through the program.  We were recently awarded a grant from the State of
Connecticut to implement Winning Play$ at a high school in Hartford, CT
 Winning Play$ is also a
recipient of the United States Department of Education’s Excellence in
Economic Education award and the National Association of Black
Journalist’s Community Service award.
About Winning Play$
Winning Play$ is built
to meet the Common Core math standards and the Jumpstart Coalition’s financial
education standards. http://www.jumpstart.org/ 
    
It is run as a full semester course or a workshop for high
school and college students in schools and community based organizations like
the YWCA and Girl Scouts.
Winning Play$ is a four-part program:

We remind students of the skills they use every day
     that can be applied to smart decisions about money:  They
     problem-solve, they make choices, they perform under pressure. 
Goals: We help them paint a picture of who they want to
     be and the life they want to live.  They see how money can support
     that journey.
We examine how things like media
     messages, gender and racial stereotypes, as well as uninformed
     role-modeling can lead to bad financial decisions. 
Personal finance 101: Lessons on debt, saving,
     investing,  etc., all in the context that being financially literate
     can help students be who they want to be.  Understanding money is
     relevant.

 The program is
unique in that we measure its impact on behavior using Dr. Prochaska’s
Transtheoretical Behavior Change model.  http://www.prochange.com/.  We also provide teacher training, all
instructional materials, and tests.
What We Need and What You Get
Your contribution will help us make
an abbreviated 7 hour version of Winning Play$ for elementary, middle, and high
school students.  This will allow us to expand our current offering beyond
the full semester course or workshop for just high school and college students.
In addition, currently, our
evaluation is done on paper and mailed to our partners at Pro-Change to
process.  Your contribution will also help us create an online evaluation
tool that will make the process much more efficient and much less expensive!
Cost Breakdown
The costs for this
project fall into two categories:

Curriculum Development
Evaluation System Development

1.  Curriculum Development:
The Winning Play$ team will work our curriculum specialists to create: 

   7 hours of curriculum for High
     School.
   7 hours of curriculum for
     Middle School.
  
     7 hours of curriculum for Elementary School. 


Create Two 90 minute
parent/student workshops based on the program
We estimate our combined
costs for this part of the process to be $30,000.
2.  Evaluation System
Development:  Pro-Change Behavior Systems will work with our production
partner to:

 Develop Online Behavior Change
     assessment 
Develop Reporting Feature (will allow data
     analysis to be automated)
Focus Groups with new age groups: 
     Cognitive testing and interviews with children ages 6 - 12   
                        
                        
                        
                        
          
Data
     Analysis 
                          
                    
Reporting 
      
      
      
      
      
        
              

We estimate the costs
for this part of the process to be $35,000.
If we fall short of our
goal, we will use the funds we raise for curriculum development. 
Any excess with go towards funding the evaluation tool.
Impact
According to
the nation’s leading financial literacy research organization, The Jumpstart
Coaltion, American high school students got less than half of the answers
correct on a basic personal finance test.  Your support can help us start
a cycle of change in the lives of many that will not only affect those around
them, but give future generations the tools to make lasting change to their
financial behavior.
Risks & Challenges
One of the biggest challenges in
developing a program like this is to find the right partnerships and to keep
the funding and manpower stream going.  One of the inspirations for this
project was demand:  Some of the school boards and community based
organizations that are currently using Winning Play$ have requested this
abbreviated version. In addition, we are forming new partnerships with groups
that plan to use this format in existing after school programs.  The
beauty of our online delivery is that very little manpower is needed with the exception
of initial orientation and program coordination.  We will continue to use
our team as well as our relationship with All Stars Helping Kids to insure
successful delivery of this abbreviated version.  
Praise from Gloria Steinem!
Icon Gloria Steinem was kind enough
to write a list of the “Top 10 reasons” she wishes she had gone through Winning
Play$!
MY TEN TOP REASONS FOR CELEBRATING
STACEY TISDALE’S PROGRAM!
 -Gloria Steinem
 10. 85% of all women will be
solely responsible for their livelihood at some time in their lives.
 9.  Divorced women are
entitled to a spouse’s share of Social Security only if they were married ten
years or longer. The average length of marriage in the U.S. is 9.6 years.
 8. Women use health care more
than men do because of childbearing. The rate of uninsured women is growing
three times faster than the rate of uninsured men.
 7.  Advertisers target
women‘s insecurity about appearance. They do their photo-shopped best to keep
us insecure.
 6.  Cultural messages
still tell women that concern with money is a) unfeminine b) bourgeois, c)
immoral, d) too hard. This is called internalized oppression.
 5.  Chances of being poor
when you’re old in the U.S. are 70% greater if you’re a woman; especially a
woman of color.
4. Old or not, women and children
are 76% of the poor in this country; disproportionately women and children of
color.
3. Even in families of inherited
wealth, sons are more likely to control the business or inheritance than
daughters. Indeed, sons-in-law are more likely than daughters. 
2. Women are targeted for unequal
pay, high interest loans, credit cards, installment buying and unaffordable
mortgages largely because we don’t ask for what we’re worth, or learn about
interest rates and mortgages.

college, I wouldn’t have taken a lifetime to learn what Nina Simone sang to us
all, “God bless the child that has her own.”

<span><strong>FORESTCRAFT CAMP</strong> is a <strong>CO-ED CAMP</strong> open to <strong>CAMPERS AGES 13-17</strong> who have an adventurous mindset and interest in the outdoors. Our <strong>3 WEEK CAMP</strong> focuses on <strong>HIKING AND CANOEING ADVENTURES</strong> within the <strong>ADIRONDACK STATE PARK</strong> where we spend one week hiking </span>various peaks within the park, followed by a one week canoe trip, and ending with a one week backpack trip, with a few days downtime in-between trips at our base camp. Our campers learn skills such as: canoeing, backpacking, camp set up and operation, cooking, fire building, and wood carving. Base camp is an ideal spot for resting between trips as we are situated on a beautiful bay within Upper Saranac Lake, and campers can enjoy swimming, fishing, volleyball, homemade meals, campfires as well as game and movie nights.</div>
<div class=""p1""> </div>
<div class=""p1"">
<strong>What makes Forestcraft Camp particularly unique is that we are a small family camp.</strong> The owner/directors and our families are involved in every aspect of the camp from leading the trips to cooking meals and playing games within camp. For this reason, each camper feels part of something special and unique. The program can accommodate as many as 10 participants for a 3-week canoeing/backpacking camp.</div>

My name is Rachel Washington. I'm a quirky Art major college student with a dream to draw and touch peoples hearts with my work! The same way other's have touched me!  I'm starting this campaign because recently I was accepted into CalArts summer Animation Program and unfortunately there is currently no financial aid available for Extended Studies. I am truly blessed and extremely motivated to take this course! For those who don't know me, CalArts means a lot to me. Probably more than a University should mean to a student but I like that about myself. Everyday I am constantly striving to better my art work! To create work that inspires the future generations to come and make work that I enjoy! Ever since I can remember art and animation have both held a very special place in my heart! And I know that they have for you too. Whether it's Lion king, Adventure Time, Toy story, Steamboat willie or How to train you're Dragon, Cartoons both classic and new have been apart of our lives! I want to continue to bringing that happiness to the world.
 If you contribute you will be helping get so much closer to achieve not only my academic dreams but my career as well! 

  What We Need & What You Get To break it down for everyone in more detail: 
The money donated to this project 100% goes towards my tuition for this class. I've come up with some unique perks to get you more excited! For each donation depending on the amount, you'll be given an Illustration drawn by myself in any media! The larger the donation the larger drawing you will receive! 
 If for some reason we weren't to reach the goal all of the funds go right towards my education!      


   The Impact I plan to apply for CalArts Character Animation program in the fall and taking this class will benefit immensely and all the difference you're contribution will make: 
This whole thing as come to me so fast and I feel extremely lucky to have this opportunity!  
Taking this class will help me develop a stronger portfolio for my application and for internships!     Other Ways You Can Help Times are hard, believe me I know. If you can't donate, please share this with people who you think may be able to. I'm also a very spiritual person, so if you could keep me in your prayers, send positive thoughts/love, whatever you do/believe in, I would greatly appreciate it!

<p class=""normal""><strong>With this Indiegogo campaign, the Sea Party Committee seeks to raise $1500 to fund their innovative ""Mission Money"" concept.</strong> </p>
<p class=""normal"">The overall cost of this year's Earth Day Marin Festival is estimated at $20,000.  The Sea Party Committee has agreed to provide $2500 toward this amount:</p>

<p class=""normal"">Sea Party will consist of super fun games and activities that teach kids and their parents about coastal and watershed creatures and the threats to them.  No junky prizes will be distributed at the games.  Each of the activities will be a “Mission” for the kids to complete, and they get “Mission Money” for each mission.  Mission Money will consist of a penny altered with donated time on a machine (Aquarium of the Bay, San Francisco)  that imprints the penny with a sea creature.  Organizations, invited by the Sea Party Committee, will table at the event and will have fish bowls for the kids to donate their Mission Money to the organization of their choice.  The Marine Mammal Center, the River Otter Ecology Project, and the Romberg TIburon Center of Environmental Studies (SFSU) are all confirmed, with the Point Reyes Bird Observatory and SPAWN (the Salmon Protection and Watershed Network) pending.</p>
<p class=""normal"">Sea Party-invited organizations will receive the fruits of the child attendees’ actions and game play.  Right now we are estimating the return to the participating organizations as 50 cents per game, or Mission, completed.  Your donations go directly to the Marine Mammal Center, the River Otter Ecology Project and others.</p>

<p class=""normal""><strong>About Greenwood School.</strong></p>
<p class=""normal"">Greenwood School is a Waldorf-inspired PK-8 independent school in Mill Valley.  One of the principles with which the founders began 22 years ago, was that all schools should emphasize our connection with nature and teach ecoliteracy.  To that end, each grade goes out into nature, or has an experiential activity off-site which supports that specific grade’s science curriculum, one day per week.</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""normal""><em><strong>What Chloe has to say about the Campaign:</strong>  ""it is important to make people aware, especially youth, of environmental issues.  Sea Party will be a step to educating the people who will live in the environment of the future.""</em></p>

<p class=""normal""><strong>About the Sea Party Committee's Community Service Campaign. </strong></p>
<p class=""normal"">In keeping with Greenwood’s commitment to environmental education and community service, our 7th and 8th Grade students have elected to raise awareness about the threats to coastal and watershed animal life.  Using the model presented by <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Young Activist's Guide to Building a Green Movement + Changing the World</span> (2011) by Sharon J. Smith, the students identified creatures living in our watershed and off our coast as their passion at the start of the school year.  They then began conducting research about these creatures (whales, dolphins, sea birds, seals and sea lions, otters, salmon, bears, etc.) from books and periodicals, Internet sources, and interviews with experts.  In order to enable them to speak from their hearts as well as their heads, they also visit (and continue to visit) various locations where the creatures can be observed in their habitats such as Elkhorn Slough in Monterey Bay, Chimney Rock and the Point Reyes Lighthouse at Point Reyes National Seashore, Lagunitas Creek in the San Geronimo Valley, and others.</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal"">During the process they also identified children and their parents as their target audience, the members of the community who they thought they could be most effective in reaching with their awareness-raising campaign.  The student team chose a carnival/festival format as the vehicle for bringing the issues to the children in a way that was developmentally-appropriate and fun.</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal"">They were then able to make a fortuitous connection with the Director of the promotion team for the Earth Day Marin 2013 Festival, who was impressed by their commitment and has welcomed the student team as featured planners and providers of children’s activities for the festival.  The Festival will be held on Sunday, April 21, 2013, from 11:00 AM to 5:00 pm at Redwood High School in Larkspur, both on the school’s grassy square and in the gym.  The focus of this year’s festival (it has been put on twice before) is “Climate Change Solutions Day of Action.”  The thrust of this free festival is for attendees to take multiple actions in an effort to ameliorate climate change while at the event.  Prior events have attracted approximately 5,000 attendees.  More information about the overall event is available at <a href=""http://www.earthdaymarin.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.earthdaymarin.org</a>.</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal"">Sea Party, the Greenwood student team’s effort, will consist of an information table, a pledge station, a wish station, six pollution, plastic, and petroleum awareness-raising games, natural (plant-based) face painting, costumed coastal and watershed creatures, and an eco-craft. </p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal"">The pledge station will be the main action that our student team asks children to do at the event.  The parents and children will write out a pledge to take one carbon reduction activity, a photograph will be taken of the family holding the pledge, and the photographs will be projected on a screen during breaks in the adult presentations being held in the Redwood Gym.  Examples of pledges are at <a href=""http://www.cooltheearth.org/action-coupons/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cooltheearth.org/action-coupons/</a>. </p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal"">At the wish station, children can write out their wish for a healthier Earth, which will be inserted into glass bottles and installed as the first wishes placed in a series of ghost nets in an outdoor exhibition by well-known found plastics artists, Richard and Judith Selby Lang (<a href=""http://www"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www</a><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">.beachplastic.com</span>) at the Marine Mammal Center in the Marin Headlands.  Children later visiting MMC as part of field trips will also add their wishes in that on-going project.</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal"">The six games will be constructed with reused materials and will highlight human-created threats facing marine and watershed creatures.  The games (exact names still being developed) will be a (1) Six-Pack Race (essentially a 3 legged race where 2 teams of 2 kids race toward a finish line while having one leg each joined with a plastic 6-pack holder), (2) Sort the Stuff (kids have to sort compost, paper, plastic and aluminum recycling and trash within a certain amount of time), (3) Two-Person Plastic Bag Rope Viking Tug-of-War, (4) Sustainable Choices Fishing Game, (5) Biobowl (water bottle bowling), and (6) Shipstrike! (throw a beanbag whale through small holes in a sea full of cruise, cargo, and tanker ships.</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal"">In addition, one of the students will rove in costume, changing each hour, into a new creature, shaking hands with kids and sometimes being one of the games himself.  He will be covered in plastic trash at one point, which kids have to pull off to win.  At another point, in his sea otter phase, he will be giving (olive) oily handshakes - gross!</p>
<p class=""normal""> </p>
<p class=""normal"">Each student will man one of the elements all day, with all of the elements to be built by the students with help from parents.</p>

And what better way to show my love and appreciate for the dance world, by going ou tot help heal other dancers. Massage Therapy is my practical choice mixed with my passion for helping others.</p>
<p>WHAT I NEED</p>
<p>I’ve been preparing for this journey for over 2 years and I'm at the finish line! I am currently $3110 shy of my final tuition payment. And my 6 year old laptop is slowly crumbling into a large paper weight. Any successful small business needs working electronic equipment for scheduling, budgeting, and maintaining my website. So your contribution will help me make my last tuition payment. And anything additional left over will go into a new computer. And anything left after that would go into a new massage chair.</p>
<p> WHAT YOU GET</p>
<p>Every $10 contribution over $20 (i.e. a $50 donation would receive 3 raffle tickets) gets enetered into a raffle, where the winner will received a 10 hour massage package from me, valued at over $900. There will be more gifts and prizes added to the bag as my campaign chugs along. Be sure to check back regularly to see what other fun surprises I have in store.</p>
<p>THANK YOU </p>
<p>This skill I have developed, has really evolved a talent I am proud; just like my dancing. I have enjoyed discovering diferent modalities and western and eastern ways to heal the body and spirit. I want to use it to help the world discover the power of touch. That the body is meant to feel better. And massage is not a luxury for the privileged, but as important to your health as diet and exercise. I ask for your help in getting the word out there. </p></div>","Thanks for checking out my page.
