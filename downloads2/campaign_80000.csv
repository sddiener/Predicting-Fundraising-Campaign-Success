</div><p>I grew up around music since I was 8, listening to the psychedelic sounds of the 60’s  and 70’s Rock, and also doing soul and dance choreographies. </p>
<p>I started playing the guitar at 16, but I never took it seriously until I was 29 years old, when I started recording my first professional album with a band named “La VIbra”. When the band broke up I started a solo project and recorded an EP of 4 songs, in 2013, finally I got to open big concerts, which led the way to promote known artists, and could start my Southamerican tour.</p>

<p>A proposal for financial assistance to launch the CD ‘Til the Wheels Fall Off’</p>
<p>“Til the Wheels Fall Off’ is the most ambitious project ever pursued by the Bruce Smith Band. </p>
<p>We are currently seeking funding in the amount of $26,000 to launch a six-month campaign to <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">gain notoriety for the band and ensure the successful debut of the album.</span></p>
<p><b>Our Team</b></p>
<p>We have assembled an amazing and talented team to assist in this effort. They include:</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- Stephen Easley, primary legal counsel to the Buddy Holly estate and foundation;</span><br/></p>
<p>- John Burris, manager for Gary P. Nunn </p>
<p>- Jeremy Fischetti and staff of 34 Management, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">oversee day-to-day operations of the campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>Strategic Plan</b></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we envision a six-month campaign which will hopefully result in the <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">successful launch of ‘Til the Wheels Fall Off.’ Initially, the band will engage on a number of </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">strategic live music venues throughout the State of Texas, and in the meantime utilize the </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">internet and social media to increase media awareness for the band and create increased </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">visibility. </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This phase of the project is expected to last approximately three months. During this period, it is <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">our intention to produce a minimum of two highly professional and engaging music videos </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">which will be distributed through YouTube, Facebook, and all other relevant internet vehicles.</span></p>
<p>Once funding is secured, a proposed timeline for the six-month campaign is as follows:</p>
<p>Week 1 – Take photographs and write new bio to be used with album artwork and digital and <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">hard copy press kits.</span></p>
<p>Week 1 through Week 4 – Our booking agent will set up a three month schedule of live music <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">events in Austin and other interstate markets. Meanwhile, the public relations/social media </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">coordinator will make contact with all relevant local media outlets and distribute the new album </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and press kit. During this period, management believes it will have the opportunity to pursue </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">certain licensing arrangements with the television and motion picture industry and those </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">discussions will occur at this time. At the conclusion of Week 4, it is our goal to have produced </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">two new music videos from the album, as well as 100 promotional albums and vinyl copies. As </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">mentioned earlier, the Bruce Smith Band will continue to tour in strategic markets, interact with </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the appropriate local media, and continue an aggressive public relations and social media </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">campaign.</span></p>
<p>Week 12 – Album release event will be scheduled in Austin at a prominent live music venue. We <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">will use all available resources to maximize local media coverage and secure a large public </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">turnout for the event. The release event will also be utilized to film the performance and create a </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">new live video.</span></p>
<p>Week 12 through Week 24 – Initiate new tour dates to promote the new album. We intend to <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">greatly expand the number of markets we are exposed to through heavy interaction with Texas </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Independent Radio. During this period, it is our intention to fully leverage exposure on social </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">media. YouTube, iTunes, bandcamp, ReverbNation, CDBaby, Facebook, and all relevant social </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">media will be utilized to produce the maximum amount of exposure for the band and album </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">release.

<p><b>The Budget</b></p>
<p>We have estimated the total cost of the six-month campaign is $26,000 The budget is itemized <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">as follows:</span></p>
<p> $1,000 – Consulting fee to pursue television, motion picture, and potential advertisers;</p>
<p> $6,000 – Public relations professional to oversee all traditional and social media <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">activities, as well as any television, newspaper, or magazine promotion activities;</span></p>
<p> $1,100 - Professional Photograpghy and new Bio of the new band and album</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> $500 – Development of a new website and web hosting services for the duration of the </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">six-month campaign;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> $3,000 – Fee for a radio consultant to market the new album to numerous independent <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Texas radio stations. This individual will also be responsible for promotional activities in </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">markets where live performances will occur;</span></p>
<p> $2,000 for New Video Production <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">new music videos at approximately $1,000 each;</span></p>
<p> $400 – Digital music distribution expenses;</p>
<p> $10,000 for Transportation Costs wich include van rental, gas and expenses</p>
<p> $2,000 – Production expense for merchandise associated with the band. This includes the <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">manufacturing of t-shirts, koozies, etc.</span></p>
<p>In closing, I would like to personally thank you for taking the time to consider this proposal.

is because it is not all about ME. I want to provide YOU with quality 
Christmas music that you can listen to during the holiday season for 
years and years to come. Many Christmas songs have been made in the 
past, but very few of them are Christmas RAP songs. Also, these songs 
are listenable for ALL ages (kids from 1-92), since they have clean, 
non-explicit lyrics.</p>
<p>This project also has the potential to benefit OTHERS as well. A 
portion of the proceeds of the album will be donated to charities such 
as the Diabetes Partnership of Cleveland and Toys for Tots in 
Cincinnati. These charities both support causes that are near and dear 
to me. Having seen my brother (pictured below) deal with Type 1 diabetes since he was 11

<p><b>Hi there! My name is Taryn Jessen--I front the Taryn Jessen Band from Utica, NY, featuring my two amazing bandmates, Colin Jewett on drums and Jason Roberts on bass.</b></p>
<p>My grandpa was the first musician I knew, and when I was 15 and first started playing guitar, it's fair to say that he was my original inspiration.  High school is a difficult time for many. For me, socializing and ""fitting in"" weren't exactly things that came naturally to me--this left me in a pretty raw emotional state, but music was always something I could relate to, and so I started hiding away in that. To this day, songwriting and performing provide a real way for me to express myself and that's been really helpful to me.</p>
<p>Taryn Jessen Band has playing together for about three years. I've been blessed to find such great musicians, Colin, and Jason, to collaborate with and bring out the best in my songs. Over the past two years, we've released two live demos, and while these recordings have been helpful to us, we've never had the opportunity to record in a commercial studio and create a truly professional product. </p>
<p><b>We have a great batch of new songs ready to go and a fantastic producer and recording studio waiting to bring this project to life! This Indiegogo campaign is the final step toward creating our first professionally recorded studio album.</b></p>

<li><p><b>Pre-production: </b>This is an important preliminary step standard in any commercial recording project. We will start by listening through our demos and previous recordings with Mike, discuss arrangements, examine lyrics and structure, and establish a plan for how to capture each song.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Recording:</b> Next, we will start by laying down the basic rhythm section: drums first, then bass and guitar, and lastly, vocals. Some songs will benefit from additional lead lines and backing vocals to make the recording more layered and exciting. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Mixing &amp; Mastering: </b>Each track will be mixed to add excitement and nuance to the compositions. As a final step, the album will be mastered, so the listening experience is cohesive from start to finish.</p></li>

<p>&lt;3 Taryn, Colin, and Jason</p>
</div></div>","Hi there! My name is Taryn Jessen--I front the Taryn Jessen Band from Utica, NY, featuring my two amazing bandmates, Colin Jewett on drums and Jason Roberts on bass.
My grandpa was the first musician I knew, and when I was 15 and first started playing guitar, it's fair to say that he was my original inspiration.  High school is a difficult time for many. For me, socializing and ""fitting in"" weren't exactly things that came naturally to me--this left me in a pretty raw emotional state, but music was always something I could relate to, and so I started hiding away in that. To this day, songwriting and performing provide a real way for me to express myself and that's been really helpful to me.
Taryn Jessen Band has playing together for about three years. I've been blessed to find such great musicians, Colin, and Jason, to collaborate with and bring out the best in my songs. Over the past two years, we've released two live demos, and while these recordings have been helpful to us, we've never had the opportunity to record in a commercial studio and create a truly professional product. 
We have a great batch of new songs ready to go and a fantastic producer and recording studio waiting to bring this project to life! This Indiegogo campaign is the final step toward creating our first professionally recorded studio album.




This campaign is raising funds for our first professionally recorded album with Mike Davidson, a Boston-based producer and engineer with 15+ years of experience working with both established and up-and-coming musicians. We are working together with Mike to comb through our original material, fine tune arrangements, and help capture and execute our vision for this album.We've already recorded one song with Mike for you to check out for free on this campaign page, called, ""What Can I Do."" Check it out directly below!This song is a great example of the album we'll be able to make if this campaign reaches its goal, with its heavy-hitting rhythm section and edgy, emotive vocals. If we reach our goal, we'll be able to get back into the studio with Mike to record the rest of our album!While we've been able to cover the costs of recording ""What Can I Do"" on our own, when you're recording at this quality, costs up add quickly! Your donation will go towards the following costs:
Pre-production: This is an important preliminary step standard in any commercial recording project. We will start by listening through our demos and previous recordings with Mike, discuss arrangements, examine lyrics and structure, and establish a plan for how to capture each song.
Recording: Next, we will start by laying down the basic rhythm section: drums first, then bass and guitar, and lastly, vocals. Some songs will benefit from additional lead lines and backing vocals to make the recording more layered and exciting. 
Mixing & Mastering: Each track will be mixed to add excitement and nuance to the compositions. As a final step, the album will be mastered, so the listening experience is cohesive from start to finish.




   




What do you get for your generosity and support? So many awesome things!

We are so appreciative and grateful for any support you can lend to this campaign. In exchange for your generosity, we've put together a really exciting group of gifts that are available exclusively through your participation in this campaign.

<p> We have been super lucky with the bands we have had play such as JAJA
OK (previously known as Francobollo), MOHIT, SOPHIE JAMIESON, OH SISTER, VV BROWN, MANDLEBROT SET, MAYBUG and
Many more. </p>
<p>Two years later Greenstone is
gradually growing and has gone on to do live nights within London and online
music sessions called Canapé’s that we share twice a month and we aim to make weekly. This has all been self funded and now we need YOUR help to keep it going.</p>
<p>We’re eager to build on the
previous success of what we have done not just on one day but all year round
consistently. </p>
<p>So we’re planning for 2016.

<li>We not only have a love of music in performance, we already are a community of people.</li>
<li>Our goal is not to become the biggest festival in the world but one that has an attention to detail and focuses purely on music and gathering in a positive place.  We simply want to use our talents to make a difference.  Those in the life are often the movers and shapers of our society – and many demographics are often <b>grossly </b>misrepresented.

We've already finished the tracking of the album, and we're ready to take it to a truly great producer to mix and master our recordings.

<p><b>Pourquoi
une campagne de socio financement?</b><br/></p><p>En 2014, une choriste du Choeur Radio VM visite le magnifique village de Saint-Venant-de-Paquette. C'est le coup de foudre! Elle contacte son chef de choeur et tente de le convaincre d'y présenter un concert. L'idée fera son chemin...<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Au printemps 2015, le Choeur Radio VM et Mozart sont attendus à Montréal (23 mai) et à Saint-Venant-de-Paquette (24 mai) !</b><br/></p>
<p>
Le Chœur Radio
Ville-Marie est un organisme de bienfaisance. Il doit assumer seul
ses nombreuses dépenses (cachets des instrumentistes, location d’un
local de répétition, achat de partitions, location d'instruments,
publicité, etc.). Pour y parvenir, le Chœur Radio VM perçoit une
cotisation annuelle de ses membres et fait également appel à la
générosité de ses commanditaires. De plus, par souci d’autonomie,
toute la gestion et la bonne marche du chœur sont assurées par un
conseil d’administration bénévole, formé de cinq choristes
membres, élus lors de l’Assemblée générale annuelle.</p>
<p>
En mai 2015, nous
présenterons <i>La Messe du Couronnement </i>et

une campagne de socio financement?En 2014, une choriste du Choeur Radio VM visite le magnifique village de Saint-Venant-de-Paquette. C'est le coup de foudre! Elle contacte son chef de choeur et tente de le convaincre d'y présenter un concert. L'idée fera son chemin...Au printemps 2015, le Choeur Radio VM et Mozart sont attendus à Montréal (23 mai) et à Saint-Venant-de-Paquette (24 mai) !

Le Chœur Radio
Ville-Marie est un organisme de bienfaisance. Il doit assumer seul
ses nombreuses dépenses (cachets des instrumentistes, location d’un
local de répétition, achat de partitions, location d'instruments,
publicité, etc.). Pour y parvenir, le Chœur Radio VM perçoit une
cotisation annuelle de ses membres et fait également appel à la
générosité de ses commanditaires. De plus, par souci d’autonomie,
toute la gestion et la bonne marche du chœur sont assurées par un
conseil d’administration bénévole, formé de cinq choristes
membres, élus lors de l’Assemblée générale annuelle.

En mai 2015, nous
présenterons La Messe du Couronnement et
les Vêpres solennelles de Mozart, à Montréal, ainsi
que dans un magnifique petit village bucolique des Cantons de l’Est,
Saint-Venant-de-Paquette. Les présentations d'un concert d'une telle
envergure exigent un financement important : pas moins de 12 000 $,
afin entre autres, de s'assurer les services de solistes, un
orchestre de 10 musiciens et de louer l'église Saint-Jude à
Montréal et le Musée-église de Saint-Venant-de-Paquette.

<p>THANK YOU for your consideration in joining me on this journey.

<p>There are many unknowns in the music industry, but one things for sure - it is YOU that keeps me going. Iv'e worked hard, taken a ride on that emotional roller coaster, spent hours perfecting my skills, made many sacrifices and dedicated my life to this musical journey but I couldn't do any of it with out you. <br/></p>
<p><b>TOGETHER</b></p>
<p>""Together"" is one of  14 songs off my new album due out April 24th 2015. It will be released as a single 10th April 2015. The album has been in the making for 2-3 years. It's my baby. I am bursting at the seams to get it out! Together is an EPIC song with inescapable hooks. Its powerful, dramatic, edgy and BIG POP sound flirting with country undertones has it poised to crossover into different market streams. It deserves an AMAZING video to showcase the emotion and purity that can be drawn from it. </p>
<p><b>WHY I NEED YOU</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I won't sugar coat it.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The magnitude of what could be achieved with the help of your contribution is HUGE. </span>The<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> goal is to hit main stream radio and then use that momentum to go international.

<p><b>THE CREW</b></p>
<p><i>Little Sister Films of Christchurch</i> has been contracted to direct and produce the video. They are an established company experienced in music video production with their own video production crew. A video concept has been produced. The only secret i'll give away is it involves fire and a grand piano! If I reach my goal, I can create this amazing video. The higher the budget - the more effective and higher quality the video.</p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Trudie Millar Stylist of Wanaka </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">is on stand by to be in charge of wardrobe for myself and any actors/extras used in the video. She is amazing!</span><br/></p>
<p><i>Tracey Z Taylor Make Up and Shannon Vanwalt Hair Stylist both of Wanaka</i> are both on standby to do their part in the video also. Both incredible!</p>
<p><i>Noise PR </i>in Auckland will be working on the radio plugging and release of the single/video.</p>
<p><b>WHATS IN IT FOR YOU?</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As a thank you, I have formulated unique perks such as free copies of my new album, tee shirts, tickets to my shows, personalised thank-you's, dinner or lunch with me, the opportunity to be a part of the music video and much, much more!! </span><br/></p>
<p>If I DON'T reach my goal then I will use what I have raised and we will shoot the video accordingly. At the end of the day, having a video is better than not having a video.</p>
<p>I am really excited to see the progress of this campaign and I can't wait to have you involved. You can share my campaign with your friends to help make this project even bigger! I really feel like I am reaching a major milestone in my career, especially with my new music and I would really love for you to be a part of that:) </p>

Trudie Millar Stylist of Wanaka is on stand by to be in charge of wardrobe for myself and any actors/extras used in the video. She is amazing!
Tracey Z Taylor Make Up and Shannon Vanwalt Hair Stylist both of Wanaka are both on standby to do their part in the video also. Both incredible!
Noise PR in Auckland will be working on the radio plugging and release of the single/video.
WHATS IN IT FOR YOU?
As a thank you, I have formulated unique perks such as free copies of my new album, tee shirts, tickets to my shows, personalised thank-you's, dinner or lunch with me, the opportunity to be a part of the music video and much, much more!! 
If I DON'T reach my goal then I will use what I have raised and we will shoot the video accordingly. At the end of the day, having a video is better than not having a video.
I am really excited to see the progress of this campaign and I can't wait to have you involved. You can share my campaign with your friends to help make this project even bigger! I really feel like I am reaching a major milestone in my career, especially with my new music and I would really love for you to be a part of that:) 
Thank you so much! Keep rockin' life. 
Lots of love,

<div>Our goal is to accumulate enough money for each voicer to record. (Factoring in the extra money that may be needed if one voicer takes too long recording, or any other problems we may run into.) If we don't make this goal, the money made will go into recording for whichever voicers are available soonest.

<p>The actual impact of this is up to our audience. We are hoping to at least change the way you view mental illnesses (and any additional subjects we go over).

Ever wonder how much of an impact you could have on the world?
By joining us, you could start doing your part in change!
RK Sympathy is an organization which takes technology and uses it to spread mental illness awareness, to change people's lives. The core part of the technology we use to do this are the singers we create, in a program called UTAU.
Creating singers, it sounds strange, right? Believe it or not, they sound very human. Not only that, they can teach us to be human!
By assigning each voice, or as we call them, Sympathyloid, a mental illness, we are able to create an entire personality and history to go along with them. With this, each of our creations have a life laid out in front of them, lives just like ours.
When we show you their experiences, you are viewing an example of what others with the same mental illness could be facing. All the hardships, the effects to daily life, the thoughts that come along with them, the physical impacts, and the dents in social abilities, you see them all, and hopefully, you understand it all.
Sympathy and empathy are two important factors in our organization, and if we're unable to achieve both, we're going to at least achieve one. Sympathy.
How can you help us with this? There are many ways. The most effective is by downloading our voices and using them for the better good!
Each stands for their own mental illness, and you can use them to share awareness about them from experiences and knowledge of your own!
If you'd like to support us further, complete voicebank languages are sold in our webstore, they include five extra banks!
Additionally, we now have an application section for those who wish to help out with our cause!
We thank everyone for their continuous support, and wish everyone a good journey in forming their empathy-filled lives!
 

What We Need & What You Get
In order to create these computer-generated singers, each requires a voicer who can record themselves speaking specific syllables for the singer to process and make its own. Voicers are also called 'voice base's because of this.
The problem we're currently running into is a lack of funding. It costs a lot of money to keep this going, and so we figured we'd ask for help with the biggest part of us: our voices!
In order to produce the best quality voicebanks, we need the best quality equipment. There are currently 8 voicers who require access to recording studios, and each need to record 6 voicebanks for each language.
If we only ask for one language now, and each bank took only an hour, it'd still be $300 per voicer!
Our goal is to accumulate enough money for each voicer to record. (Factoring in the extra money that may be needed if one voicer takes too long recording, or any other problems we may run into.) If we don't make this goal, the money made will go into recording for whichever voicers are available soonest. If we exceed our goal, the money will go into both recording, and anything else the voicebank needs before release. (Official art for the voice [like the ones in the pitch image by Weissidian] and oto'ing of the voice.)

A percentage of the money from the full version is donated to a selected charity or organization for the specific mental illness that Sympathyloid has.

The Impact

 
The actual impact of this is up to our audience. We are hoping to at least change the way you view mental illnesses (and any additional subjects we go over). Having a mental illness is like having any other type of illness. Instead of looking down on those who have it, why not try to put yourself in their shoes? Would you have been able to even make it as far as they have?
Isn't music a great way to share these feelings? That's why we have to do this! If we want to help create a positive mindset towards those who suffer from these illnesses, then we must portray it in a positive way!
Our idea may be a little strange, but we're at least putting effort into it to help everyone! Whether it be getting people to be looked at positively, or helping others to understand.
Risks & Challenges

A few problems that come up with recording at studios are the voicer taking longer to record than expected, and the voicer unable to record the reclist (recording list) properly from mispronunciation.
We've gone through it before. One voicer got nervous being in a setting such as a studio, and in the end only recorded 2/9 reclist pages in 2 hours. Does this mean it's impossible to record in time? No.
I (Ruka) am another voicer, and also the one who helps with Japanese (and some English) pronunciation to those who need it. After that voicer's time ran out, I recorded the full reclist in an hour.
So what happened? We didn't practice enough.
What needs to be done this time is a scheduling of practice sessions beforehand. Not of just one or two sessions, but of four or five instead. During these, we will go over both pronunciation and how to face microphone fears. Additionally, to make sure we have everything down, we shall make sure the voicer recording will be able to meet a few hours beforehand for extra practice and review.
Outside of the recording studio, the only real problem will be making sure our audience uses the voices for awareness. We will be ourselves, but we will need to trust you with doing so too!

Two months ago, his daughter Adama Conteh was killed and his wife Kaddy Jallow badly burnt when a gas stove exploded at his mother-in-law’s house in Brikama, The Gambia. After they buried their 2 ½ year old daughter, Yankuba’s wife had to get a bush taxi (there are no ambulances where they live) to Dakar in Senegal. There was nowhere for her to get good burns treatment in The Gambia. I  sent them  money to pay for her hospital treatment in Dakar and having spent 1 month there, she has now returned home where she needs ongoing care from family, not to mention emotional support.</span><br/>

<p>I am hoping to raise enough money to allow Yankuba, to come to the UK and conduct a music tour that i am organising for us in April-May 2015. Following such a tragedy in their lives, I had also hoped to bring Yankuba's wife and five year old son over too, but due to her medical condition, she would not be allowed into the UK. I would like to send  some of the money raised to Yankuba's wife so that while he is in the UK , she and their son will be well looked after. All his family want Yankuba to come to the UK and do this tour!</p>

<div>Thanks for taking the time to come say hi and for taking an interest in helping a dream come true.</div>
<div>I am a solo artist by the name of MeMe Detroit. I have just finished recording my debut album (""Live to Love you'll love to live"") after over a year &amp; a half of hard and dedicated work not just from myself but from all the amazing musicians involved in making this record (Which I am so appreciative of). If you haven't already, you can click the trailer vid above to listen whilst you read.</div>
<div>I had the masters back for a final listen and I've gotta say I am so so proud of the finished product. It's everything a girl like me could ever want in a debut album. </div>
<div>Album preview listens have already started generating great praise from the likes of Luke Johnson (ex Lost Prophets/No Devotion), Emma Scott (Pluggin baby/kerrang radio/XFm), Benjamin Weinman (Dillinger Escape Plan) &amp; Adam Zindani (Stereophonics/Casino).</div>
<div>What I would love now more than anything in the world, is to get this album out there and heard by you and the people all over the world. I would love people to hear my album and have it move and inspire them like musicians and artists alike have moved and inspired me! Music is a lifeline to our lives in so many ways! :) </div>
<div>This album so far has been completely self funded and I will continue to put my all into it, however, to push it to that next level I would love a little extra help. <span style="""">What better way to receive help than from the people who enjoy and support me and my music! So YOU, the fans become a part of this too! </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""""><br/></span></div>

Thanks for taking the time to come say hi and for taking an interest in helping a dream come true.
I am a solo artist by the name of MeMe Detroit. I have just finished recording my debut album (""Live to Love you'll love to live"") after over a year & a half of hard and dedicated work not just from myself but from all the amazing musicians involved in making this record (Which I am so appreciative of). If you haven't already, you can click the trailer vid above to listen whilst you read.
I had the masters back for a final listen and I've gotta say I am so so proud of the finished product. It's everything a girl like me could ever want in a debut album. 
Album preview listens have already started generating great praise from the likes of Luke Johnson (ex Lost Prophets/No Devotion), Emma Scott (Pluggin baby/kerrang radio/XFm), Benjamin Weinman (Dillinger Escape Plan) & Adam Zindani (Stereophonics/Casino).
What I would love now more than anything in the world, is to get this album out there and heard by you and the people all over the world. I would love people to hear my album and have it move and inspire them like musicians and artists alike have moved and inspired me! Music is a lifeline to our lives in so many ways! :) 
This album so far has been completely self funded and I will continue to put my all into it, however, to push it to that next level I would love a little extra help. What better way to receive help than from the people who enjoy and support me and my music! So YOU, the fans become a part of this too!

<p>By contributing towards this ambitious project you get the satisfaction of supporting a talented young composer and knowing that you've helped bring an exciting new piece of choral music into the world.  </p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Firstly, by donating, you give an exciting young composer the opportunity to write a new choral work for a non-professional choir.  Very few choirs take on new commissions as it can be a risky business, not knowing what the music will be like as it's never been performed before!  This work will add to Chris's extensive and exceptional portfolio, hopefully giving him further exposure and boosting his career.</p>
<p>Secondly, the opportunity to sponsor a world premiere is a very rare occurrence and, we are hoping, that through our networks, friends and supporters in the music world, this work will see repeat performances across the country in subsequent years.  You can be a small (or large!) part of that by donating to the project.  Everyone who donates will be mentioned in the score in all subsequent reprintings.</p>
<p>Finally, you are giving two talented choirs the opportunity to sink their teeth into a really new and different work, and present a new work, a world premiere, to their family, friends and supporters.  </p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Rehearsing and performing any new work provides many challenges for everyone involved. The music isn't readily available for the choir or musical director to listen to, or the composer's ideas may not be perfectly realised and compromise may be necessary.  We will limit the risks in various ways.  Included in the cost of the commission is provision for several visits from Chris to hear how the choir are progressing so he can advise accordingly.  We have added in additional rehearsals specifically on the new work where both choirs can meet each other and rehearse together.  </p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you feel you are unable to donate there are many other ways you can get involved:</p>
<p></p>

<li>Join one of the choirs!  Cantare rehearse on a Wednesday from 7.30 at the Rochdale Music Service in Rochdale, and Greater Manchester Police Male Voice Choir on a Thursday night, also from 7.30, at Sedgley Park in Prestwich.</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A new community centered, truly independent local radio station, needs your help to break the current monopoly and monotony!</b></h3>
<p>Of the 24 mainstream 'local' FM &amp; digital radio stations serving the UK Counties of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire &amp; Buckinghamshire, all but one are owned &amp; programmed by just five companies: Global Radio, BBC, UKRD, Bauer Media &amp; the Adventure Radio Group.</p>
<p>Some of this may sound good but what gets left out?</p> <p><b>YOU!</b> </p>
<p>the people living in this region, set aside in favour of generic ideas &amp; standard playlists, dictated by central HQ</p>
<p>Local radio is about place and all places are different. We believe that the radio should be different too.</p>
<p><b>Serious Radio UK </b>will give you a choice AND a voice. We will highlight parts of the region you love, amplifying its voices and sounds. We will be a station for the people, businesses &amp; organisations who live &amp; work in these three counties.</p>
<p><b>Serious Radio UK </b>is all about you the listener.</p>
<p>As part of your community, we will drive to deliver not just entertainment, but also empowerment, optimism, fun and a collective that will support you in your everyday life.</p>

</div></div>","A new community centered, truly independent local radio station, needs your help to break the current monopoly and monotony!
Of the 24 mainstream 'local' FM & digital radio stations serving the UK Counties of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire & Buckinghamshire, all but one are owned & programmed by just five companies: Global Radio, BBC, UKRD, Bauer Media & the Adventure Radio Group.
Some of this may sound good but what gets left out? YOU! 
the people living in this region, set aside in favour of generic ideas & standard playlists, dictated by central HQ
Local radio is about place and all places are different. We believe that the radio should be different too.
Serious Radio UK will give you a choice AND a voice. We will highlight parts of the region you love, amplifying its voices and sounds. We will be a station for the people, businesses & organisations who live & work in these three counties.
Serious Radio UK is all about you the listener.
As part of your community, we will drive to deliver not just entertainment, but also empowerment, optimism, fun and a collective that will support you in your everyday life.



                                          

Why Serious Radio?
 We will be locally owned and operated. Not networked from a studio in London with presenters that have no connection to the people or locality they are broadcasting to.
Why Serious Radio?


We are serious about supporting the communities and being a regular presence, including frequent live shows from the towns and communities.
We are serious about providing a voice and a platform to generate and enhance community interaction as well as promotion for events of all types, not just the 'showcase' ones!
We are serious about the music, which is why we will not have a restricted playlist.
We are serious about supporting local talent, providing airtime for bands and musicians, along with coverage of festivals and events of all genres and sizes.
We are serious about supporting causes important to you, which is why we intend to fundraise each year, along with generating awareness and support for chosen causes and issues. We are a station that, dances with BIG ideas!

We are serious about being a radio station for the people. Which is why Serious Radio UK will always be open to your feedback and suggestions.

They believe in an approach to football that is not only played the right way, but unites people and   communities who have a passion for all aspects of football. Here at Serious Radio UK, we too have a desire, to provide radio that not only is entertaining but that engages the communities and provides added value.
 Our partnership will include live broadcasts and commentary from the club and involvement in their community projects.

<p>Since the beginning of my musical journey I have been a fan of new music and new composers. Having been a student composer myself, I know how difficult it can be to find a chorus of people willing to read new music. So I have an idea!</p>
<p>Why not start an ensemble devoted to reading brand new compositions of student composers? We could read through the work, rehearse it, then as an ensemble discuss it briefly, sharing opinions, insights, thoughts, etc. We could then provide an audio recording for the composer, along with the conductor and singers' notes for the hopeful edification of the composer. </p>
<p>So this is exactly what I am setting out to do. At first we will have one session intended for the singers as a sight-singing party simply to share in the joy of music making.</p>
<p>I will be gathering together an ensemble of singers to sightread brand new compositions by primarily student composers. These composers are primarily unpublished, and the music we will be reading has not yet been premiered. Our aim will be to read and rehearse each piece, and then have a brief discussion afterwards. Every participant will be invited to write comments, questions, and suggestions to each of the composers. After the event, the comments from the participants will be compiled and sent to the composers with an audio recording of the rehearsal of their work. </p>
<p>It is my hope that this event is a success and becomes a recurring event, that perhaps will even spawn a semi-professional ensemble that is devoted to recording and performing the works selected for the project. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>The Conductor</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A native of Green Bay, Wisconsin, Davy Chinn is a vibrant and energetic
young conductor, composer, and percussionist. After earning his Bachelor of Arts
degree in Music Composition and Theory from Indiana Wesleyan University, he
spent a year studying choral music and conducting at the University of Colorado
Boulder. He then ventured farther West when the University of Southern
California’s Thornton School of Music accepted him into the Master’s program.
In his first year of study at USC, Chinn was accepted into the USC Thornton
School of Music’s Board of Counselor’s Mentorship Program, through which he was
awarded mentorship with Grant Gershon. As a champion of new music, Chinn has
prepared choruses for and conducted six world premieres, and hopes to continue
doing so throughout his career. Within the field of the choral art, Chinn has a
developing interest in multimedia and visual accompaniments of music, inspired
largely by his interest in and passion for the Deaf community. During his undergraduate
studies, he had the privilege to be the assistant conductor of the Indiana
Wesleyan University Chorale, and One Voice, a small worship-centric vocal jazz
ensemble. As a choral performer, he has performed with such artists as Point of
Grace, Fernando Ortega, Barry Manilow, the Gaither Vocal Band, the Rolling
Stones, and Elton John. He has performed on such programs as the Crystal
Cathedral’s “Hour of Power,” the Thrilling Adventure Hour podcast, L.A. Live’s
Christmas tree lighting, and the Primetime Emmy Awards. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>Though the singers are volunteers, there are always expenses with a production of this kind.

</div></div>","The Project 
Since the beginning of my musical journey I have been a fan of new music and new composers. Having been a student composer myself, I know how difficult it can be to find a chorus of people willing to read new music. So I have an idea!
Why not start an ensemble devoted to reading brand new compositions of student composers? We could read through the work, rehearse it, then as an ensemble discuss it briefly, sharing opinions, insights, thoughts, etc. We could then provide an audio recording for the composer, along with the conductor and singers' notes for the hopeful edification of the composer. 
So this is exactly what I am setting out to do. At first we will have one session intended for the singers as a sight-singing party simply to share in the joy of music making.
I will be gathering together an ensemble of singers to sightread brand new compositions by primarily student composers. These composers are primarily unpublished, and the music we will be reading has not yet been premiered. Our aim will be to read and rehearse each piece, and then have a brief discussion afterwards. Every participant will be invited to write comments, questions, and suggestions to each of the composers. After the event, the comments from the participants will be compiled and sent to the composers with an audio recording of the rehearsal of their work. 
It is my hope that this event is a success and becomes a recurring event, that perhaps will even spawn a semi-professional ensemble that is devoted to recording and performing the works selected for the project. 
   
The Conductor


A native of Green Bay, Wisconsin, Davy Chinn is a vibrant and energetic
young conductor, composer, and percussionist. After earning his Bachelor of Arts
degree in Music Composition and Theory from Indiana Wesleyan University, he
spent a year studying choral music and conducting at the University of Colorado
Boulder. He then ventured farther West when the University of Southern
California’s Thornton School of Music accepted him into the Master’s program.
In his first year of study at USC, Chinn was accepted into the USC Thornton
School of Music’s Board of Counselor’s Mentorship Program, through which he was
awarded mentorship with Grant Gershon. As a champion of new music, Chinn has
prepared choruses for and conducted six world premieres, and hopes to continue
doing so throughout his career. Within the field of the choral art, Chinn has a
developing interest in multimedia and visual accompaniments of music, inspired
largely by his interest in and passion for the Deaf community. During his undergraduate
studies, he had the privilege to be the assistant conductor of the Indiana
Wesleyan University Chorale, and One Voice, a small worship-centric vocal jazz
ensemble. As a choral performer, he has performed with such artists as Point of
Grace, Fernando Ortega, Barry Manilow, the Gaither Vocal Band, the Rolling
Stones, and Elton John. He has performed on such programs as the Crystal
Cathedral’s “Hour of Power,” the Thrilling Adventure Hour podcast, L.A. Live’s
Christmas tree lighting, and the Primetime Emmy Awards. 
What We Need & What You Get Though the singers are volunteers, there are always expenses with a production of this kind. Expenses include: recording engineer fees, copies of music for all of the participants, collaborative pianist fees, postage fees for shipping recordings and comments to the composers involved, and simple needs such as water for the singers. Every penny raised will go directly into the program, even if we do not reach our goal. If we are fortunate enough to exceed our goal the additional funds will be used for all future events.  The perks are designed with the hope that all of the sponsors have a passion for continuing the art of choral music. You can get your hands on perusal copies of currently unpublished music, as well as hear the work that the singers put in to the sight-reading and rehearsal session.   The Impact The value of music has been made clear time and time again through scientific research, award winning productions, and our own personal experiences. Composers world-wide are continuing to expand the art by adding their voice to the available repertoire. We would be nowhere without the great composers of the past who have written pieces that have become ""standards."" However, at one point in time these composers were writing new music that was pushing the boundaries of composition. This tradition is what makes the arts unique. It is our responsibility and our privilege to encourage artists to continue creating, and to share it with the world.

The story goes.  As a teenager, I lived my life inside a dream - I didn't fit in, apart from when I sat inside a classroom - or when I was writing words on paper.  This became a ritual of mine - rather than face the world, I'd make notes of the world and people around me.  Hiding inside toilet cubicles, plugging the headphones into my ears, the music made most sense to me.
And I stole a piece of your diary - traced the words with my fingertips - in red ink.  These words lead me to the math which lead me to the music.
I wished I had a head for math.
Sometimes, it is the things we need the most, which come to us in disguised ways.  And the mix tape lead me here.  For on that tape, was everything my future holds.
The photo above was taken in Bellows Falls, Vermont, 2003.  The summer after finishing my first year of uni, I made the decision to fly across the Atlantic to be there.  Because it was the math, it was the red ink, that lead me there.
And so, this lead me here.  To write my own songs, and to be here now, typing these words, that have long been forgotten.   How you can help... So that I can take my demo songs into the studio and work on them with some musicians and get them recorded, produced and mastered, there is going to be a bit of work involved:  I am setting my goal at £750 with the remaining £250 to be made up by myself (this seems small, but I am doing this because my options are few) - this will cover the predicted fortnight-long access to studio time to get the album recorded, produced and mastered. If you are happy to pledge any amount to this project, you will be rewarded!  These will range from a copy of my EP (which will be a pre-cursor to the album), to gig tickets, the chance to write for a music paper, your name on the album credits, the chance to co-write a song or short story. If I do not reach the entire goal, the remainder of the funds raised will go towards the charity record (a separate project) I have been working on for the past two years, too - which also needs to be funded in order to be produced.    The Record... There are personal reasons for wanting to get this album made.  Mostly, because the songs have been written for a while now, but have been put on the back-burner for various reasons.  To create something tangible with artwork and liner notes, would feel a massive achievement.  As well as music, I am working on a collection of short stories which are sometimes loosely connected to the song themes - as yet, I am not sure when this will be completed but the album and the book will work in conjunction and one will help to explain and inform the other...  I hope I can bring something to the world with my music and writing. If I can inspire you even just a small amount, as I have been inspired in my lifetime, then I will feel like it wasn't a waste. This will remain in the world beyond my own existence.  Art and thought remains.    The Process...  The songs I would like to include on my album are written in their basic bones stage of evolution.  I'd like to build on these demos and take the songs to the studio where I can record the vocals and guitar parts - and then work with adding additional instrumentation and production - mixing them up & getting the final album made and hopefully a few physical copies of CDs too (that's the hope)!  To do this, I need to first decide where to record the tracks. I need to work out alongside a sound engineer, the best ways to add to my work - this is where the big costs come in - and a reason why I am crowdfunding.    Your Encouragement... Really helps!  Seriously.  Apart from helping me to fund the recording - it is also a boost to know that there are folks out there who actually would sit down and listen to my songs at the end of it all.  Please feel free to share this campaign and support where possible.

We feel that this kind of cooperative world music is especially important in this divisive time. This collection is from a group of musicians from very different parts of the world coming together expressing our common spiritual ecstasy in sound. It has been over a decade since we have recorded new material for this format and from playing  the music live, we feel it is ready to go.

We feel that this kind of cooperative world music is especially important in this divisive time. This collection is from a group of musicians from very different parts of the world coming together expressing our common spiritual ecstasy in sound. It has been over a decade since we have recorded new material for this format and from playing  the music live, we feel it is ready to go.

<p><strong>Singer/Songwriter from Birmingham UK has been chosen to perform on an American TV show in New York on April 30th to sing songs from his forthcoming crowd funded album.</strong></p>
<p>Spence  Cater, 44, from Birmingham, was personally invited by the show’s presenter and executive producer Jimmy Lloyd to the next recording of the show in the Soho area of New York.</p>
<p>They initially met in 2013 at a recording of a UK episode of the show and have since co-written several songs together.</p>
<p>Jimmy comments,'Spence is a supremely accomplished songwriter, his songs are very believable, any listener can relate to them.'</p>
<p>Spence who started busking 3 years ago, has so far played in London, New York, across Belgium and recently played a sold out show in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Spence is about to record his first album with top producer and musician Michael Clarke who recently featured in last years comedy ‘On the Road’ starring Ricky Gervais’s alter ego David Brent, as a member of his band Foregone Conclusion.</p>
<p>Spence says, ‘This to play on this show is a huge opportunity for me as Jimmy only selects songwriters of a high calibre, to even be invited to play is a real honour.</p>
<p><strong>About Spence.</strong></p>
<p>Singer/Songwriter Spence estimates that he has played to over 1 million people since he started busking in 2014.</p>
<p>His recorded music has also been heard by over a million people a year as it’s played across stores in Europe.</p>
<p>The opportunity to promote his songs on the Jimmy Lloyd show is a promotional package that can't really be bought off the shelf, it is only by invitation. This will go a long way help to raise awareness of his forthcoming album.</p>
<p>All this is in your hands as potential investors, could you help Spence make the most of this golden opportunity? </p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3>
<p>OK, so let me be clear about this as there are <strong>two</strong> projects rolled into <strong>one</strong> campaign.</p>
<p><strong>The priority here is to record my album, which will cost £2640.</strong></p>
<p>That breaks down as <strong>£2000</strong> for the studio time (14-15 days approx.)</p>
<p>PLUS <strong>£400</strong> for CD manufacturing (first run of 300)</p>
<p>PLUS <strong>£240</strong> for Indiegogo and paypal fees which are 10% approx.</p>
<p>Michael Clarke, the producer has very kindly agreed to take on this project at a special rate.</p>
<p>His services are very much in demand and his skill and talent will be a huge factor in making this a great record.</p>
<p><strong>This means that any money up to and including the target will be used solely for recording the album. You will be funding the Album project only and <i><u>NOT</u></i> the trip to New York if you choose to BACK IT.</strong></p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>So, that means <strong>any extra that I make after the £2460 has been reached will be towards my trip to New York.</strong> </p>
<p>Here are the approximate extra costs that I will spend any excess on:</p>
<p><strong>£600</strong> will be on the New York trip, the accommodation and expenses.</p>
<p><strong>£500</strong> will be for the video production and design costs*</p>
<p><i>*Dominic Day produced the promotional video for me and I think he's done a terrific job on it. He brings a lot of energy focus, creativity and skill to any project and his dedication and professionalism is unquestionable. He offered to do this completely free and so I would dearly love to be able to pay him for his time. </i></p>
<p><strong><i>If I am lucky enough to exceed the goal and cover the costs above then any more extra will go into making the record better, extra time mixing, mastering, better quality manufacturing, promotional costs, etc.</i></strong></p>
<p>I will be using live streaming to capture the studio process as well so you can be a part of it and see how the songs are developing.</p>
<p><u><i>I hope that is clear to you as a potential investor!</i></u></p>
<p><strong>There are some great perks to be had.</strong></p>
<p>You could jump straight in and fund the whole album which will effectively make you the executive producer where you will have a say in how the album plays, the look and design and even get a writing credit on one of the songs!</p>
<p>You could even pay to come along and experience the behind the scenes of the TV recording in New York. Meet the presenter and the other performers then hang out afterwards.</p>
<p><i>You can also get a song written and recorded for you personally, just give some information about you or your loved one and I will write and record your very own song and add the option of recording it on to vinyl, your very own record!</i></p>
<p>If I am unlucky enough to reach my goal then the project will still go ahead as much as the budget allows, so instead of a 10-11 track album it would be a 5-6 track EP for example, everyone involved will just get a smaller fee and the project will take a lot longer, thus losing out on some momentum. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is my very first studio album and has all my life experience up to now in it.</p>
<p>I really want to leave a legacy of my music for my daughter, so she can have something that I have created just for her, her arrival changed my life in many ways and I would love to leave her this gift, that's if I never get to make another album.</p>
<p>As a Singer/Songwriter this album will be my calling card and allow me to access the next level of my career, getting airplay, support slots and planning a tour will all be more possible with a strong album to promote and sell,  the profits getting reinvested back in to recording more tracks and albums and supporting promotional costs.</p>
<p><i>Being invited to feature on the Jimmy Lloyd Songwriters showcase is a really huge bonus opportunity for me</i>.</p>
<p>Jimmy has his pick of the best emerging songwriters in New York and LA and so isn't into giving favours, he has a reputation to maintain and his show has high  production and content values which is why it has been taken up by NBC, Apple TV and now Amazon TV, they only accept high quality productions. Needless to say this kind of exposure to a potentially huge audience will help to raise my profile and help to secure more airplay and gigs both here and in the US.</p>
<p><i><strong>This chance to play on the show, plus having a new album to promote at the same time is a terrific way of capturing the momentum and taking advantage of the opportunities that arise during this time. </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>Promotion of this type is priceless and would go a long way to getting my songs out to the biggest possible audience and hopefully create more interest in the album.</strong></i></p>
<p>These songs are the story of my life so far and include themes of addiction, recovery, broken relationships and death. If one song helps one person through a dark time then it will be worthwhile because music has certainly saved my life. </p>
<p>I have recorded many tracks before in many different studios and many different producers, I am very experienced in starting and finishing recording projects.</p>
<p>The last track I recorded was with Michael whom I have chosen again to work with as he is such an incredibly talented producer, musician, singer and genuinely lovely guy, a real safe pair of hands. Plus he is very local to me so it maximizes the time in the studio cuts down on travel costs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges that face me during this project are lack of funding and blocking out the time to record the album. The lack of funding issue will be solved by tailoring the project to the budget so just recording fewer songs as well as actively looking for more sponsorship and support, in order to make the record that I want to give to you.</p>
<p>I am aiming to block out 10  consecutive days to record the album so I can get it done in one flow but that may not be possible due to having work commitments, but the aim is to get the album done swiftly but not rushing, so it get's to your ears as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The more support I can get to finance the record and the trip then the sooner it can be produced and be out there for your guys to listen to.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><i>I totally get that you might want to help but can't contribute financially, that's OK, if you were to share this campaign to your friends and family then that will be a very kind act that may help me reach my target and to take advantage of this unique opportunity.</i></p>

<h3>Short Summary of Rather Be</h3>
<ul>
<li>Laramie is a captivating indie rock band with roots in Memphis, Tennessee. The group is a diverse combination of multi-talented musicians and writers guided by lead singer and songwriter, Laramie Renae. Rather than being hindered by a challenge, Laramie turns diversity into one of their strongest qualities and uses it as a tool to write dynamic works of art. Band members are given the freedom to express their individual creativity and craft while staying true to the group’s underlying message and overall sound. With each song, Laramie aims to leave a lasting impression and to draw the listener in for a ride that promises to be haunting, raw, and transparent.</li>
<li>This is the first full-length album that Laramie will have produced. In order to create the best representation of each song, funds are required. Laramie strives to use the best of the best, as best they can to allow each song to come alive. There are worlds within songs, so we need as much support as we can get!</li>
<li>Achieving the sound that we hear with this album will be the greatest gift that comes with your donation to the project. Allowing as many people as possible to be a part of making this album successful is what will really launch the album to greatness. Without you, without your love and support, the album will not be all that it can be. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $12,000. This is a very ambitious amount, but we trust that those who believe in our music will be drawn to the project and help us get the album underway! The funds will go towards production, manufacturing, graphic design, mixing and mastering, and promotion of the album. </li>
<li>The perks are awesome! The incentives for this album will include: A pre-release of the album, a download of the leading single, merchandise (such as shirts, stickers, posters, etc.), the Laramie discography, house shows, and a personal song written uniquely for you!</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, the funds we do receive will go towards studio time and production, as well as mixing and mastering. We still want the music to be heard!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>These songs represent raw, transparent, honest and wild feeling. As we have said before, there are worlds within these songs and we want you to be able to be a part of each unique experience. </li>
<li>For our first EP, The Good Men, we successfully raised more than our goal, which was significantly less than what we are raising for this album. Regardless, we know that we can do it with your help and financial support. Nothing is impossible, we are sure of that. </li>
<li>We are genuinely, so, so excited for you to hear these songs, stories and snapshots. We want you to be able to step inside each song whenever you want to and experience each journey on your own. Music is a universal language and we want to translate ours. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our support and fan base has grown since the last time we did this! But, this also means that there is a greater responsibility for us to produce music that is timeless and valuable. </li>

<p><i>""Having risen to prominence in the early nineties as guitar player in the trail-blazing blues band , THE HOAX, Jon Amor has gone on to establish himself as a talented singer and songwriter in his own right.

<p><i>Jon disbanded AMOR in 2005 to write “Unknown Soldier”, produced by Stephen Evans (Robert Plant, Goldfrapp, The Proclaimers, Thea Gilmore), an album endorsed by an outstanding guest appearance from the legendary Robert Plant on ‘Ball &amp; Chain’, and featuring drummer Clive Deamer of Portishead and Radiohead fame.</i></p>
<p><i>Jon followed this with the more stripped-down acoustic studio album, “Stories From The Crooked Room”, which features a collection of finely crafted songs with Dave Doherty on guitar, Chris Doherty on bass and Simon Small on drums.  This quartet then formed JON AMOR BLUES GROUP, a high energy, dynamic blues rock outfit that toured Europe extensively and produced two highly acclaimed studio albums between 2011 and 2013.</i></p>

<p><i>Jon continues to tour extensively around the UK and Europe and will return to the studio in 2017 for a new album of self-penned material.""</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan...</h3>
<p>With most of the album now written, I'm preparing to go into the studio this summer to record these brand new baby songs and then set them loose in the world. I'm very excited to be working with Stephen Evans, a long-time friend and a producer with whom I've enjoyed a fruitful working relationship. I'm also hoping to persuade some of my fine musician friends to come along and play a turn on the record.</p>
<p>The aim, with the help of you good people, is to raise £10,000 through this campaign. This will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time</li>
<li>Production costs (recording, mixing and mastering)</li>
<li>Pressing, printing and design costs</li>
<li>.....and hopefully a small slice to give it a bit of promo</li>
</ul>
<p>You can help me get there by simply pre-ordering the album in its various formats (all of which will be signed, but don't forget 'the unsigned ones are rarer'....)</p>
<p>Or you can browse the list of additional perks, on the right of your screen, which include all sorts of offers, from simple packages, credits on the album artwork, a day in the studio seeing it all go down, to watching me play a solo set in my very own living room (drinks and nibbles supplied). You can even pay for me to bring a band to YOUR living room to do a gig.</p>
<p>And, I'm offering the one and only notebook that I've been exclusively using to scribble down lyrics and ideas. One of a kind, and still not fully finished.</p>
</div><div><p>You'll receive your copies of the album ahead of the official release date, of course.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I've had the opportunity to make a new album of my own songs in my own name, and I'm raring to go. If you guys can help me do it by making a pledge, I'll be your friend forever.</p></div><div> </div><div>
<h3>...but if you can't....</h3>
<p>Times are hard, and sometimes it's just not financially doable, but you can still help by sharing this page with people you think may be up for it. Indiegogo provide simple tools for doing that.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance,<br/>Jon</p>

<h3>My Story, My Vision</h3>
<p>Hi! For those of you who don't know me, my name is Dave Mallen, and I’m an independent musician living in the Washington, DC area. In 2006, I founded <a href=""http://www.innovationstationmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Innovation Station Music</strong></a>, a professional recording studio uniquely focused on artist development and helping musicians to be successful in their careers.</p>
<p>Working out of my home, I've been able to foster a comfortable, collaborative environment where musicians feel free to express themselves and explore their full potential. I'm proud to have produced over 200 artists and bands from the DC area and beyond, as well as numerous award-winning songs.</p>
<p>Now, after a decade of making music in a small townhouse basement, I’m excited to be building the studio of my dreams: <strong>a state-of-the-art, multi-room facility that will provide <i>even greater benefits </i>for musicians from the DC area and beyond!</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476146301/vk1k3tngua1xtyfv8yfo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What exactly are those benefits, you ask?</strong><i><i> </i><i> </i></i></p>
<p>Well, <strong><i>if you're a musician</i></strong>, you'll appreciate the sweet-sounding, fully soundproof rooms, pristine audio, relaxed vibe, and opportunities to collaborate and network with other artists and music industry professionals.<strong><i> </i></strong><i><strong>If you're a music supporter</strong></i>, I want to welcome you into the world of music creation. When completed, Innovation Station Music ""2.0"" will be the only area studio specifically designed to allow YOU to engage with musicians and the creative process through a fantastic series of events. <i>Pretty cool!</i></p>
<p>As you might expect, a project of this magnitude requires a significant investment. Construction is already underway, but we've been hit with some unexpected costs.<strong> </strong>That's why<strong> </strong><strong>I’m asking for <i>your help</i> in getting this project across the finish line.</strong> Your support will allow me to purchase audio equipment I need to make truly incredible-sounding recordings and empower our local music community for years to come.</p>
<p>Would you like more details? Yes?  Great! Please read on.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Project Details &amp; What I Need</h3>
<p>For the past year, I’ve been working with renowned studio architect <strong><a href=""http://www.weslachot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wes Lachot</a></strong> to design a world-class studio in the basement of my new home in Annandale, VA.</p>
<p>The amount of detail that has gone into the planning of this new studio is staggering. From the <strong>4-zone, quiet-operation HVAC system </strong>designed to make every room comfortable with no audible noise, to the <strong>structural redesign </strong>needed to remove columns and afford more space to musicians, to the <strong>Philips Hue LED lighting system </strong>in which each individual bulb can be adjusted to set the right mood -- every aspect of the design has been thoughtfully considered to ensure musicians have the space, comfort, and tools they need to create and communicate freely.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476399686/q78n0hsxd8vjvgscwmpu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When I first contacted my designer, I must admit I had a bit of sticker shock. He told me I'd need to budget $175/sq. ft., which would mean roughly $200,000 for the construction alone! After a lot of soul-searching, I decided I was all-in. My wife Emily and I put a huge chunk of our life savings into escrow, secured a bank loan, and got some additional help from our families. We hired several contractors, and were off to the races!</p>
<p><i>Well, not exactly.</i> As we neared construction, we were faced with the reality that some of the cost projections provided by our contractors were seriously underestimated.</p>
<p>Now, rest assured, this thing is getting built! But<strong> I need to raise at least $25,000 </strong>so I can afford to purchase and provide the very best audio equipment for my artists on day one. <strong><i>By contributing to my Indiegogo campaign, you'll not only be helping me make up the difference, you'll be MAKING A DIFFERENCE </i></strong><i>-- in my life and the lives of so many in our music community.</i></p>

<h3>Here's What's In It For You</h3>
<p>At first, I was reluctant to ask for help. I've always relied on my own resourcefulness and resolve to work through life's challenges. But the more I thought about crowdfunding, the more I realized h<i>ow many amazing rewards and unique experiences I could offer all those who contribute!</i></p>
<p>Our complete list of ""Perks"" is over on the right (with more TBA!), but let me highlight just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Music and Merch</strong><strong>:</strong> ""Dave's Faves"" 20-song sampler featuring tracks I've produced and engineered over the past 10 years, CDs donated by award-winning singer/songwriter Talia Segal, Limited Edition Innovation Station Music supporter T-shirts</li>
<li>
<strong>In the Studio:</strong> ""Legends &amp; Locals"" Listening Parties, Songwriting and Guitar Master Classes, ""Be an Executive Producer"" experiences, VIP Concerts with our artists, plus Studio Tours</li>
<li>
<strong>Other Cool Experiences:</strong> Wine Tasting/Music Pairing with international wine expert Sonja Eberly, a semi-formal ""Backers' Ball"", Pizza with Dave, DeLorean rides(!!)...and more to be announced throughout the campaign.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, we have some incredible stuff to offer you! And hey, if you're interested in more than one perk, you can check out as many times as you like (you'll just need to make separate transactions for each one). I think there's something for everyone, but you can also simply donate by clicking the <strong>BACK IT</strong> button at the top of the page. No matter how you choose to participate, you'll have my sincere thanks, and the knowledge that <i>you're helping me make my dream a reality -- and in turn, fueling my efforts to support the music community around me.</i></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>MahraJazz (2017) is a small alternative jazz festival, the first-ever Palestinian music festival to take place in Haifa (Palestine). Organised by an independent group of young individuals working in various fields of culture and production, MahraJazz will be held on two consecutive weekends on 24-26 August – 31-2 September, and will showcase a variety of international and local jazz musicians and subgenres. MahraJazz is a non-profit, volunteer based event which aims at reaching wider Palestinian crowds in gathering as well as through radio broadcasting.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a snowball of local Palestinian efforts that are reclaiming Haifa as a Palestinian urban centre for culture and knowledge production, as it was before its occupation and dismantling in 1948. These various efforts and projects have been contributing to the building of a cultural autonomy that seeks to be ungoverned by occupation or colonialism.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For those of you that don’t know me I’m a singer/songwriter from Philadelphia, PA. I released my first 3 debut singles back in 2012, all of which were recorded in Nashville &amp; produced by multi-platinum producer Kenny Lamb (N’SYNC/Justin Timberlake/Rhett Atkins) with engineering by Chris Rowe (Taylor Swift/Jewel).</p>
<p>Since then I’ve toured up &amp; down the east coast playing over 200+ shows, graduated from college, opened for Jon McLaughlin during the summer of 2016 &amp; spent 2016 living in Nashville writing for both myself &amp; other artists.</p>
<p>It’s been 5 years since I’ve released new music and well...I think it’s about time! I have so many new songs I want to share with you guys!! In addition to my own original material, I’ll be putting together an acoustic cover video series. Taking some of my (and hopefully yours!) favorite songs from pop, country &amp; soul, stripping them down to an acoustic form and making them my own. I’ve had this vision in my head for over 2 years now. The only thing standing in my way are the funds to make it happen!</p>
<p>I’ll also be contributing a portion of the funds raised to <a href=""https://www.vocalid.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VocaliD</a>, an amazing company out of Boston that creates unique vocal identities for individuals who rely on text-to-speech devices to communicate. The donated funds will be enough to cover the cost of a voice for someone in need. After being sidelined with a vocal injury a few years back, I feel so lucky to have the ability to sing and get to do what I love, given the circumstances. If I can use my voice to inspire someone else and help someone in need, to me that’s everything. Thank you so much for your support!!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So what does the money go towards? A lot of things!</p>
<ul>
<li>- 6 FULLY PRODUCED Original tracks</li>
<li>- 12 FULLY PRODUCED Acoustic Cover tracks &amp; videos.</li>
<li>Paying the musicians, paying the producers/engineers, paying the videographer, paying for studio time, paying for the costs associated with printing the actual physical CD’s (the EP will be available in physical copy as well as digital), covering our licensing &amp; distribution costs, promotional materials, tip reward fulfillment costs, along with a tiny extra cushion to cover any additional costs that may occur: think extra musicians, an additional track, any additional distribution fees etc.</li>
<li>And as mentioned a portion of the funds raised will be going towards VocaliD to fully cover the cost of a voice for someone in need.</li>
</ul>
<p>What Do You Get:</p>
<ul><li>Some really cool prizes and an unbelievably grateful heart from me, not to mention a TON of NEW MUSIC!!!</li></ul>
<p>What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal:</p>
<p>When there’s a will there’s away. I’m going to make this project happen no matter what! If I make less than our goal, I’ll have to reevaluate a few things and figure out how I can make things work within our financial constraints. But hitting our goal will make for a fast streamlined process and will make creating this project a lot easier.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
For those of you that don’t know me I’m a singer/songwriter from Philadelphia, PA. I released my first 3 debut singles back in 2012, all of which were recorded in Nashville & produced by multi-platinum producer Kenny Lamb (N’SYNC/Justin Timberlake/Rhett Atkins) with engineering by Chris Rowe (Taylor Swift/Jewel).
Since then I’ve toured up & down the east coast playing over 200+ shows, graduated from college, opened for Jon McLaughlin during the summer of 2016 & spent 2016 living in Nashville writing for both myself & other artists.
It’s been 5 years since I’ve released new music and well...I think it’s about time! I have so many new songs I want to share with you guys!! In addition to my own original material, I’ll be putting together an acoustic cover video series. Taking some of my (and hopefully yours!) favorite songs from pop, country & soul, stripping them down to an acoustic form and making them my own. I’ve had this vision in my head for over 2 years now. The only thing standing in my way are the funds to make it happen!
I’ll also be contributing a portion of the funds raised to VocaliD, an amazing company out of Boston that creates unique vocal identities for individuals who rely on text-to-speech devices to communicate. The donated funds will be enough to cover the cost of a voice for someone in need. After being sidelined with a vocal injury a few years back, I feel so lucky to have the ability to sing and get to do what I love, given the circumstances. If I can use my voice to inspire someone else and help someone in need, to me that’s everything. Thank you so much for your support!!
 

What We Need & What You Get
So what does the money go towards? A lot of things!

- 6 FULLY PRODUCED Original tracks
- 12 FULLY PRODUCED Acoustic Cover tracks & videos.
Paying the musicians, paying the producers/engineers, paying the videographer, paying for studio time, paying for the costs associated with printing the actual physical CD’s (the EP will be available in physical copy as well as digital), covering our licensing & distribution costs, promotional materials, tip reward fulfillment costs, along with a tiny extra cushion to cover any additional costs that may occur: think extra musicians, an additional track, any additional distribution fees etc.
And as mentioned a portion of the funds raised will be going towards VocaliD to fully cover the cost of a voice for someone in need.

What Do You Get:
Some really cool prizes and an unbelievably grateful heart from me, not to mention a TON of NEW MUSIC!!!
What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal:
When there’s a will there’s away. I’m going to make this project happen no matter what! If I make less than our goal, I’ll have to reevaluate a few things and figure out how I can make things work within our financial constraints. But hitting our goal will make for a fast streamlined process and will make creating this project a lot easier.
 
The Impact

As an independent artist, I sometimes wonder if what I do really matters. Have I grown as an artist? Am I further than when I first started down this crazy road five years ago? Does any of it truly matter? The answer: Yes. It matters because I haven’t given up. I keep playing and the gigs & the crowds just keep getting better, as does the music. 
The immediate impact of this campaign is we get to create a debut EP, an acoustic cover video series, creating 18 tracks in total, along with providing a voice for someone in need. This new material will allow me to present myself in a new light, with a new sound, allowing me to finally be able to put new material into the world.
In the ever-changing music industry, this project will also create new opportunities for me to step up as an artist along with the platform to move forward both in my career and in life.
While all of the above is extremely important, it's the impact I have an artist that matters most. It's having the ability to inspire & brighten someone's day through music that makes all the difference.
It’s the group of middle school girls who come up to you after you've played a show at their school, the look of sheer joy, excitement & the thought that maybe they can do this too. It’s the little kids who have been in a hospital for far to long, that you get to make laugh & smile as you go from room to room playing a few songs through Musicians On Call.
It’s the younger artist who you get to cheer on & watch as they grow in their confidence, and think to themselves, “Well I’m here now, but maybe someday I can be there, because look, she did it.” To me, that’s the impact.
No, I don’t have a major label or hundreds of thousands of dollars to put into a project, create large budget videos and no I don’t play arena shows – yet. Instead, I get to call the shots, write the songs I want to write, perform at some really cool venues and maybe if I’m lucky, I’ll get to inspire one or two people along the way.

<h3>AltitudeProject.org</h3>
<p>30 musicians based in Chicago collaborating on one album.  All proceeds will be donated directly to the Music Box Foundation.  </p>
<p>Music Box Foundation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free classes to children and disabled individuals.</li>
<li>Help students achieve scholarships.</li>
<li>Teaching the business of music to advanced students.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are inspired as musicians by the work within the community that Vernon Lloyd and his staff at Music Box provide.  The passion shown by these educators is infectious. As Musicians who live in Chicago, we aim to do whatever we can to help fund grass-roots organizations such as Music Box.  When you take the arts away from a child, they loose one of the most effective avenues of self discovery.  They miss out on a chance to learn the meaning of dedication, critical thinking and the vision of a bright future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal (Budget Breakdown)</h3>
<p>Recording, editing, mixing, scheduling and mastering an album for any band is a process with a lot of overhead when you are adhering to industry standard production value.  What if your band has 30 working musicians?  The overhead multiplies exponentially.   </p>
<p>The scope of this project is enormous.  Though the musicians are lending their talents for free, there are third party professionals who will need to block out their schedules to work on this project exclusively for nearly a month and a half.  The $11,500 allocated to our Executive Producer and his team is more than a bargain.  Blocking out a month of your schedule adds up quickly.  One must also consider the amount of work they've already contributed over the last year of planning, as well as the 6 studio sessions already completed.</p>
<p>The rest of our budget is geared toward making the album a success.  Our definition of success is two fold;  On the one hand we want to sell as many copies of the album as we possibly can.  That is a success because none of the musicians, producers, engineers, designers or videographers will receive any of the profits, rights or royalties from the album sales.  All of the former will be owned 100% by the Music Box Foundation.  The Altitude Project is creating this album for that purpose specifically.  The Altitude Project was founded for this purpose.</p>
<p>Our second definition of success would be to sell as many copies as we can, in turn raising awareness that something like this is even possible.  What if musicians all over the country got together once a year in each city and made an album that would benefit an organization promoting the arts in high risk area to children and the disabled?  That's what we aim to do.  That makes it possible by definition.</p>
<p>We want to see collectives like the Altitude Project pop up in cities everywhere.  Musicians willing to put their reputation on the line to raise money for charities that give back to their community.</p>
<p><strong>$20,000 allocated as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Tracking, Overdubs </u>(30 Musicians), <u>and Studio Fees</u></strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Advertising:</u></strong>  The only way that Music Box can benefit from this is by advertising the album.</p>

</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Not only do we have a growing roster of talented musicians committing to this project, we are proud to announce that two advanced students of the Music Box Foundation will be featured on the album.  This will help give the Music Box Foundation more than just the proceeds.  This gives them a personal sense of ownership over the album.  The chance at a crucial age to take part of a massive project and learn from that experience.</p>
<p>One album won't change the harsh realities of the south side of Chicago, however, it will give these students an experience that fosters personal growth.  It will raise awareness that there are safe havens like Music Box that are available and are fighting to keep the arts alive for children in Chicago.</p>
<p>The arts teach us how to dream.  Music teaches us how to dream. </p>
<p>When you promote the arts to children, you empower a community from within.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>This album can become a reality with your contribution.  We have already begun production.  We finished 1 track featuring our core group of musicians.  Check it out at <a href=""http://www.altitudeproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.altitudeproject.org</a></p>
<p>We ask that you keep up with our progress.  Hold us accountable.  Give suggestions.</p>
<p>With so much negativity surrounding the the current socio-economic climate of Chicago, it's time we raise the altitude a bit and get behind something positive.  </p>
<p>This project is about self empowerment over violence and gentrification.  As musicians from Chicago, we want to make sure that every child has access of the arts.</p>
<p>This is our city.  We owe it to our youth.  We will make an album if we fall short of our goal.  We hold true to our word to the Music Box Foundation no matter what.  That said, If we can make this budget a reality together... WE CAN ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH MORE!</p>

<br/><p><b>Martin Worthy</b> has been enjoying life as a musician since he began playing drums as a 12 yr old. He met his lifelong friend and musical partner, Paul Quarrington, in high school and they soon established themselves as  Quarrington/Worthy, a singer-songwriter duo in the early 1970s. They released a number of recordings together, with their self-titled album leading to a #1AOR hit - ""Baby and the Blues"", engineered by Daniel Lanois. During that period, Martin also played drums in the rhythm section for the legendary Joe Hall and the Continental Drift (with Paul Quarrington joining him on bass). Since those early years, Martin has composed music for various film and video projects, recordings and bands. Currently, he is singing and playing drums and a variety of other instruments in Stuart Laughton's eclectic band Radio Dial. Prior to this, he was a member of the well-known blues/roots band, Pork Belly Futures for many years, writing songs and playing numerous gigs as their drummer and vocalist. Throughout his career, he has continued to work as a singer/songwriter, receiving an Ontario Arts Council Grant to write a series of songs inspired by Canadian novels in the late '90s, and most recently, releasing his own CD - ""Everyone's Gone to the Moon"".

She also had the opportunity to study jazz with many great jazz piano players, including David Virelles, Nancy Walker, Brian Dickinson, and Bernie Senesky. Megan has extensive experience as a professional accompanist, recording artist and performer. She has recording credits on two albums with the Canadian band, Pork Belly Futures and also recorded a single with Turkey-based EDM artist DJ Tarkan, creating an international pop song that has been making waves online. Currently Megan is composing, playing keys and singing harmonies with local band Edgewater Hotel who recently celebrated the release of their debut EP. Edgewater Hotel can be seen playing at iconic Toronto venues such as The Horseshoe Tavern and The Silver Dollar. Megan can also be found playing and singing solo at various venues in the GTA.</p>

I really believe in this music, so does the band and the growing fan base we are creating. I hope you will join our team of supporters!


I'm Collette Savard, a singer-songwriter originally from North Bay ON Canada now based in Toronto. For nearly my whole life I've been writing and performing my own songs. I have already recorded three albums mostly with my own funds and with the generous help of many other talented musicians.

We are all thrilled to get into the studio and honour this great bunch of tunes. 

The Toronto Arts Council got us started with a generous grant of 9k. I know that sounds like a lot of money in this era of DYI but at this stage in my career it's time for me to take this thing to another level. As always, I'm working with professional musicians who deserve to be paid their worth especially given the fact that the live music business just doesn't pay reasonable wages. Studio work is one of the last paying options for musicians and those gigs are few and far between so it's important for me that my musicians get paid proper scale.

Martin Worthy has been enjoying life as a musician since he began playing drums as a 12 yr old. He met his lifelong friend and musical partner, Paul Quarrington, in high school and they soon established themselves as  Quarrington/Worthy, a singer-songwriter duo in the early 1970s. They released a number of recordings together, with their self-titled album leading to a #1AOR hit - ""Baby and the Blues"", engineered by Daniel Lanois. During that period, Martin also played drums in the rhythm section for the legendary Joe Hall and the Continental Drift (with Paul Quarrington joining him on bass). Since those early years, Martin has composed music for various film and video projects, recordings and bands. Currently, he is singing and playing drums and a variety of other instruments in Stuart Laughton's eclectic band Radio Dial. Prior to this, he was a member of the well-known blues/roots band, Pork Belly Futures for many years, writing songs and playing numerous gigs as their drummer and vocalist. Throughout his career, he has continued to work as a singer/songwriter, receiving an Ontario Arts Council Grant to write a series of songs inspired by Canadian novels in the late '90s, and most recently, releasing his own CD - ""Everyone's Gone to the Moon"". More information about Martin can be found at martinworthy.com.

<div>The making of Human began after the release of our first project ""The Melody"". The most received song off that EP was called ""Beautiful Thing"" which focused on the stories of the kiddos I (Myra) have had the opportunity to work with in the foster care system. Gabe and I knew -with the relatively small success of that song- that we had to go deeper with our songwriting and expose more than just the basics of love. We knew we had to give a voice to those who struggled to get their's heard. Over the past 7 years I have had the privilege of mentoring kiddos in the foster care system focusing on therapeutic treatment such as developing coping skills, Independent living skills and pro- social skills. I have listened to their stories, felt their burdens and ultimately have just let them cry in my car because that is what they needed. I knew I had to give them a voice, and that's when the collaboration between Gabes' melodies and the songwriting started to collide. </div>
<div>5 songs are going to be on this EP that capture the heart of what it means to be Human.These kiddos have a need to feel accepted. They want to be viewed not just as a child in the foster care system, but as a human being, not defined by their past but by who they are and everything they are trying to be.  <br/>
</div>
<div>Identity is what we as a society are constantly trying to find an answer for. These songs are universal to not only the kiddos I have worked with, but for anyone and everyone. We are all just trying to be Human. </div>

</div><div> <p>Gabe and Myra Gleason make up the Percussive Soul/Pop duo Stereo RV. They recently changed their name from ""Pending Black"" due to the name not being rooted in who they are as a duo. Stereo RV is broken down into three categories. 1) Stereo is dual, you have your left and your right. 2) Beatbox used to be an old-school name for a stereo. 3) We have  been living in our 1989 Trendsetter RV for over 3 years now. It was our first home together after we got married and all our growth as artists has been developed in 250ft of space. WE still currently work full-time but that is about to change in September as we take a leap of faith and pursue music full-time in hopes of having some dreams come true.</p>
<p>With any goal or dream comes risk. We are done recording 5 of the songs for Human, however we are at the top of our budget and need help. Which is where you come in. WE STRIVE TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN BY OURSELVES, but we find ourselves asking for some help with the completion of this EP.  We are asking for $3,500 dollars that will get our album mixed and  mastered from engineers in the industry who understand the detail of making a ""radio-ready"" record. It also includes the copies of CD's we will need to be printed so you all can have one! Plus, we also have booked a full fledged tour that we embark on in October and goes until the end of November, So whatever we raise over the $3500 goes right back into the music and helps with tour expenses. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

</div><div>Gabe and I have written all the songs on this EP. We recorded 3 of songs at<a href=""http://fremontrecording.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Fremont Recording</a> with Justin Calhoun behind the production wheel.</div><div>We just got back from an amazing time in New York working with 2 time ASCAP award winning producer, John Degrazio with <a href=""http://watersoundentertainment.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Watersound Entertainme</a>nt where we recorded 2 more songs for the  EP. Because we recorded in different studios there is high importance that the mix and mastering be cohesive. John will be finishing the mixing and mastering for this project on all 5 songs.</div><h2>Know where your investment is going! </h2><h3>Here's the breakdown.</h3><div>Mixing and Mastering will be 50% of the costs</div><div>PR and Marketing will be 35% of the costs - (Cause you guys want it to be a huge hit just as much as us right?!)

<h2>THANK YOU!!!!!!</h2>
</div></div>","WHAT IS THE HUMAN EP
The making of Human began after the release of our first project ""The Melody"". The most received song off that EP was called ""Beautiful Thing"" which focused on the stories of the kiddos I (Myra) have had the opportunity to work with in the foster care system. Gabe and I knew -with the relatively small success of that song- that we had to go deeper with our songwriting and expose more than just the basics of love. We knew we had to give a voice to those who struggled to get their's heard. Over the past 7 years I have had the privilege of mentoring kiddos in the foster care system focusing on therapeutic treatment such as developing coping skills, Independent living skills and pro- social skills. I have listened to their stories, felt their burdens and ultimately have just let them cry in my car because that is what they needed. I knew I had to give them a voice, and that's when the collaboration between Gabes' melodies and the songwriting started to collide. 
5 songs are going to be on this EP that capture the heart of what it means to be Human.These kiddos have a need to feel accepted. They want to be viewed not just as a child in the foster care system, but as a human being, not defined by their past but by who they are and everything they are trying to be.  

Identity is what we as a society are constantly trying to find an answer for. These songs are universal to not only the kiddos I have worked with, but for anyone and everyone. We are all just trying to be Human. 
ACOUSTIC VERSION OF OUR FIRST SINGLE. ""Human""



 WHO IS STEREO RV?
 Gabe and Myra Gleason make up the Percussive Soul/Pop duo Stereo RV. They recently changed their name from ""Pending Black"" due to the name not being rooted in who they are as a duo. Stereo RV is broken down into three categories. 1) Stereo is dual, you have your left and your right. 2) Beatbox used to be an old-school name for a stereo. 3) We have  been living in our 1989 Trendsetter RV for over 3 years now. It was our first home together after we got married and all our growth as artists has been developed in 250ft of space. WE still currently work full-time but that is about to change in September as we take a leap of faith and pursue music full-time in hopes of having some dreams come true.
With any goal or dream comes risk. We are done recording 5 of the songs for Human, however we are at the top of our budget and need help. Which is where you come in. WE STRIVE TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN BY OURSELVES, but we find ourselves asking for some help with the completion of this EP.  We are asking for $3,500 dollars that will get our album mixed and  mastered from engineers in the industry who understand the detail of making a ""radio-ready"" record. It also includes the copies of CD's we will need to be printed so you all can have one! Plus, we also have booked a full fledged tour that we embark on in October and goes until the end of November, So whatever we raise over the $3500 goes right back into the music and helps with tour expenses.  
AS A COLLABORATOR ON THIS PROJECT, YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW YOUR INVESTMENT IS BEING USED!
Gabe and I have written all the songs on this EP. We recorded 3 of songs at Fremont Recording with Justin Calhoun behind the production wheel.We just got back from an amazing time in New York working with 2 time ASCAP award winning producer, John Degrazio with Watersound Entertainment where we recorded 2 more songs for the  EP. Because we recorded in different studios there is high importance that the mix and mastering be cohesive. John will be finishing the mixing and mastering for this project on all 5 songs.Know where your investment is going! Here's the breakdown.Mixing and Mastering will be 50% of the costsPR and Marketing will be 35% of the costs - (Cause you guys want it to be a huge hit just as much as us right?!) We have hired Kaytea with XOpublicity to get these tunes out to industry and ears we could never reach. We're excited to have her on board!Getting the CD's made and duplicated is about 15%Protect your investment! So many ways to help reach our goal!


The ImpactWe have been working on this EP for over 2 years and we are incredibly excited about it. The foster care community and it's impact on mine and Gabe's life in the Salem/Portland areas has influenced us in ways that aren't easy to express. The small lives I get to encounter on a daily basis have had a deep impact on the way I see humanity. This project is so important because of the affect it can potentially have on anyone who has been trying to discover who they are and what it means to just be a person on this earth. YOUR CONTRIBUTION makes you apart of our project. We are reaching out to you, OUR COMMUNITY, who has supported us, asking you to make a commitment to our music by sharing and supporting this campaign.

WE can't thank you enough for the support we have received over the years. To those who have come out to our shows and been our ""Woo"" people, to the sharing of our videos and telling your friends, we thank you so deeply.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ENGLISH / ITALIANO a seguire</strong></p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Caramè and I'm a singer songwriter from Italy. A year ago I recorded and produced my first album and since then I've been sharing it with the world through performing many concerts, touring in Europe and playing in the street.</p>
<p>The way my music has been received is so incredible that I sold the 1000 copies I printed in little more than a year!!!</p>
<p>Encouraged by this success and inspired by many stories I decided to record in a new album the songs I've wrote during this journey.</p>
<p>This album should reflect the maturity I gained in life, in music and the inspiration I draw from the black american music. It is also coming from a desire to collaborate with some fantastic musicians I've met along the way. To make it more vibrant and colorful, I chose to record this new album entirely live.</p>
<p>Below you can find more details about why and how I'm doing this.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>In this video I perform my song ""Just a Smile"" for 'SofarSound Milan' </u></p>

<h3>Where the Funds Will Go </h3>
<p>Making this project is not an easy, nor a cheap mission to complete.  <br/>Here is a breakdown of the budget that will cover the cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording, arranging, mixing, mastering</li>
<li>Artwork, Graphics, Website, Video and etc.</li>
<li>CD manufacturing and printing</li>
<li>Marketing, PR, promotion</li>
<li>Creating and posting your gifts (Perks)</li>
<li>IndieGoGo and Credit card fees</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>At This Stage</h3>
<ul><li><h2><strong>If you wish to Pre-order the album then check on the right side for the  list of perks and the amount you wish to choose &gt;&gt;</strong></h2></li></ul>
</div><div>
<p><u>It is better If you can, do it straight away for 2 reasons:</u></p>
<p>1. It will help my crowd funding to take off by getting an early momentum.</p>
<p>2. Later on you might just forget. </p>
<p>Also, I kindly invite you to share this project with your friends via social networks, email or the word of mouth.  This would help a lot to make this dream come true.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The recording process of this album will start in January 2017 and I hope to complete it by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Regardless the success of this fund-raising campaign I am committed to complete this project and even if we don't reach the funding goal I will still get this album out. Your help will really help the financial aspect of it and validate my work as an emerging singer/song-writer.</p>
<p>It is also an opportunity to be part of a meaningful artistic project and to get my album before everyone else :)</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Could Help</h2>
<p>Spreading the word and sharing this campaign with your friends, your family or with anyone you think would enjoy the music and have interest for this project is another very helpful way to support me.</p>

<p>Ciao a tutti,</p>
<p>Il mio nome è Caramè e sono un cantautore d'origine italiana. Un anno fa ho registrato e prodotto il mio primo album, condividendolo fino ad ora con il mondo attraverso concerti, tour in Europa e suonando per strada.</p>
<p>La risposta ricevuta dalla gente nei confronti della mia musica è stata così incredibile che ho venduto le 1000 copie stampate in poco più di un anno!!!</p>
<p>Incoraggiato da questo successo e ispirato da tante altre vicissitudini ho deciso di registrare in un nuovo album le canzoni che ho scritto durante questo percorso.</p>
<p>L'album vuole riflettere la maturità da me acquisita fino d'ora sia nella vita tutti i giorni che nella musica, e trarre ispirazione dalla musica nera americana. Inoltre è frutto anche del desiderio di collaborare con fantastici musicisti che ho incontrato lungo il mio cammino, con i quali, per renderlo ancora più vibrante e colorato ho deciso di registrarlo completamente dal vivo!</p>
<p>Qui sotto trovate tutti i dettagli relativi al come supportare il progetto.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>In questo video eseguo la mia canzone ""Just a Smile"" per 'SofarSound Milano' </u></p>

<h3>Come saranno investiti i fondi raccolti:</h3>
<p>Affrontare un progetto del genere non e facile, soprattutto economicamente e quindi ho pensato di chiedere supporto anche alla rete di amici e conoscenti che in questi anni ho visto crescere intorno a me . Ecco qui la suddivisione del budget che coprirà i costi:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing, PR, promozione</li>
<li>Studio di registrazione, arrangiamenti, mixaggio e musicisti</li>
<li>Lavori di grafica, Website, Video, etc..</li>
<li>Stampa e confezionamenoto dei CD</li>
<li>Creare ed inviare via posta le vostre 'ricompense' o 'Perks'</li>
<li>Spese dovute a ""IndieGoGo"" per la campagna fondi</li>
</ul>
<div>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">1. Aiuti la mia campagna nel suo decollo!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">2. Se rimandi va a finire che magari ti dimentichi! </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Inoltre, ti chiedo la cortesia di condividere questo progetto con i tuoi amici tramite i Social Networks, Email o semplicemente passando parola. Questo aiuterà molto al fine che il mio progetto diventi realtà.</p>

Hi everyone,
My name is Caramè and I'm a singer songwriter from Italy. A year ago I recorded and produced my first album and since then I've been sharing it with the world through performing many concerts, touring in Europe and playing in the street.
The way my music has been received is so incredible that I sold the 1000 copies I printed in little more than a year!!!
Encouraged by this success and inspired by many stories I decided to record in a new album the songs I've wrote during this journey.
This album should reflect the maturity I gained in life, in music and the inspiration I draw from the black american music. It is also coming from a desire to collaborate with some fantastic musicians I've met along the way. To make it more vibrant and colorful, I chose to record this new album entirely live.
Below you can find more details about why and how I'm doing this.
In this video I perform my song ""Just a Smile"" for 'SofarSound Milan' 

 
Where the Funds Will Go 
Making this project is not an easy, nor a cheap mission to complete.  Here is a breakdown of the budget that will cover the cost of:

Recording, arranging, mixing, mastering
Artwork, Graphics, Website, Video and etc.
CD manufacturing and printing
Marketing, PR, promotion
Creating and posting your gifts (Perks)
IndieGoGo and Credit card fees


At This Stage
If you wish to Pre-order the album then check on the right side for the  list of perks and the amount you wish to choose >>

It is better If you can, do it straight away for 2 reasons:
1. It will help my crowd funding to take off by getting an early momentum.
2. Later on you might just forget. 
Also, I kindly invite you to share this project with your friends via social networks, email or the word of mouth.  This would help a lot to make this dream come true.

These videos were filmed during the recordings of my first album!

Project Budget Breakdown


 
Risks & Challenges
The recording process of this album will start in January 2017 and I hope to complete it by the end of the month.
Regardless the success of this fund-raising campaign I am committed to complete this project and even if we don't reach the funding goal I will still get this album out. Your help will really help the financial aspect of it and validate my work as an emerging singer/song-writer.
It is also an opportunity to be part of a meaningful artistic project and to get my album before everyone else :)
Other Ways You Could Help
Spreading the word and sharing this campaign with your friends, your family or with anyone you think would enjoy the music and have interest for this project is another very helpful way to support me.
Here's some suggestion about how you can do it:

sharing the campaign video on your Facebook page
directing people to my IndieGoGo page or to my website
through ""word of mouth""
sending emails
sharing the campaign on music websites, blogs, radio and magazines

ITALIANO
 

Ciao a tutti,
Il mio nome è Caramè e sono un cantautore d'origine italiana. Un anno fa ho registrato e prodotto il mio primo album, condividendolo fino ad ora con il mondo attraverso concerti, tour in Europa e suonando per strada.
La risposta ricevuta dalla gente nei confronti della mia musica è stata così incredibile che ho venduto le 1000 copie stampate in poco più di un anno!!!
Incoraggiato da questo successo e ispirato da tante altre vicissitudini ho deciso di registrare in un nuovo album le canzoni che ho scritto durante questo percorso.
L'album vuole riflettere la maturità da me acquisita fino d'ora sia nella vita tutti i giorni che nella musica, e trarre ispirazione dalla musica nera americana. Inoltre è frutto anche del desiderio di collaborare con fantastici musicisti che ho incontrato lungo il mio cammino, con i quali, per renderlo ancora più vibrante e colorato ho deciso di registrarlo completamente dal vivo!
Qui sotto trovate tutti i dettagli relativi al come supportare il progetto.
In questo video eseguo la mia canzone ""Just a Smile"" per 'SofarSound Milano' 

 
Come saranno investiti i fondi raccolti:
Affrontare un progetto del genere non e facile, soprattutto economicamente e quindi ho pensato di chiedere supporto anche alla rete di amici e conoscenti che in questi anni ho visto crescere intorno a me . Ecco qui la suddivisione del budget che coprirà i costi:

Marketing, PR, promozione
Studio di registrazione, arrangiamenti, mixaggio e musicisti
Lavori di grafica, Website, Video, etc..
Stampa e confezionamenoto dei CD
Creare ed inviare via posta le vostre 'ricompense' o 'Perks'
Spese dovute a ""IndieGoGo"" per la campagna fondi


A questo punto:
Se desideri Pre-ordinare l'album in questione dai un occhiata in alto a destra e troverai la lista con le ""ricompense o perks"" corrispondenti alla somma che desideri donare >>


È meglio se puoi farlo subito per 2 motivi:
1. Aiuti la mia campagna nel suo decollo!
2. Se rimandi va a finire che magari ti dimentichi! 
Inoltre, ti chiedo la cortesia di condividere questo progetto con i tuoi amici tramite i Social Networks, Email o semplicemente passando parola. Questo aiuterà molto al fine che il mio progetto diventi realtà.
Ecco altre info riguardanti il progetto
Questi video sono stati registrati in studio durante le registrazioni del mio primo cd!

                     
Ringrazio Alberto Zanini (Guitar), Giacomo Papetti (Bass), Marco Ravelli (Keys) e Filippo Sala (Drums)

Suddivisione del Budget

Rischi & Sfide
Il processo di registrazione dell'album avrà inizio a Gennaio e spero si completerà per gli inizi di Febbraio 2017.
Il mio impegno è quello di portare a termine l'album anche se la raccolta fondi non raggiungerà la somma desiderata ed e per questo che il tuo supporto aiuterà molto il suo aspetto finanziario ed a valorizzare il mio emergere come cantautore. 
Altri modi per dare supporto
Spargere la voce e condividere questa campagna con i tuoi amici, i tuoi famigliari e con chiunque tu pensi possa apprezzare la mia musica ed essere interessato a questo progetto.
Ecco qui alcuni suggerimenti sul come farlo:

condividere il link della raccolta sulla tua pagina FB
reindirizzare amici e non alla mia pagina IndieGoGo 
spargere la voce 
mandare un'email 
fare pubblicità ad eventuali riviste musicali, blog o siti internet di tua conoscenza

Grazie per supportare questo progetto!

<h3>All I've Left Behind Digital Release</h3>
<p>""All I've Left Behind"" is the follow up project to my debut EP ""Beautiful Life"".  For my second project, I wanted to reach into the depths of who I was as a songwriter, and show the shadow side of a ""Beautiful Life"", so although there are some fun, lighthearted songs,  there are also songs of heartache, change, and loss. As everyone knows, mountain top experiences are fun, but the valley is the sustainable place where growth occurs and life is truly lived. As a human being, and an artist, I'm learning to be fully present in the valleys and not just wish them away for the next mountain top which has brought a depth to me as a husband, father, and artist that wasn't realised before. As you journey through life, sometimes the only way to know what truly has value is to leave it behind for a time. This album is part of that story. And I need YOUR help to share that story!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would LOVE to produce some beautiful film clips to coincide with the release of this album. The goal is to sync up our video and radio releases to maximise our exposure with the goal of seeing the album charting on Australian country music radio, and Australian Country Music Television.  To accomplish this, we are sending you PRE RELEASE, physical copies of this album in exchange for your contribution to our digital campaign. So you RECEIVE THIS ALBUM BEFORE THE REST OF THE WORLD, and get to help create some beautiful pieces of art!</p>
<p>We need to raise $10,000 to produce 3 film clips. </p>

<h3>The Art</h3>
<p>What I enjoy most about my life in music is the opportunity to create something that moves people. It can be a smile, a tear, or just a second thought.  With my first EP, producing the film clips for the songs was my favourite part of the whole process, and has produced the most feedback from you.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and alongside Scott Christian from Radiant Media, we are ready to produce some beautiful pictures, moving in all their 4K glory.</p>
<h3>The Challenges </h3>
<p>To really make an impact in the industry, we need to string of film clip releases alongside the radio release. The amount we raise determines the number of clips we can produce. We have a solid concept for 4 clips, we just need the financial support to see them come to life. If we only raise enough for 1 clip, thats where this journey will end. If we reach our goal of $10,000, we will be able to see 3 possibly all 4 of those ideas come to life! </p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Hi everyone! We’re Nina Noir (Frederica Mercury), Lindy Day (Brianna May), Diana Rey (Joan Deacon), Nichole Boaz (Spike Edna), and Karla Downey (Regina Taylor), and together we are The Killer Queens. It’s not an easy task bringing the work of true musical pioneers and one of the most charismatic rock singers in history to life, but we’ve committed every fiber of our technique and talent to conjuring a thrilling tribute to the Queen legacy.</p>
<p>For a long time, we’ve had an idea for a big project—a music video for Bohemian Rhapsody that pays homage to both Queen and a classic ‘90s film. Learning the music of Queen is hard work, and making this music video won’t be easy either. But as a band, we are always trying to push ourselves to take on new challenges and continue Queen’s legacy. We want to pay homage to the fans that have supported Queen throughout the decades. This video is a thank-you to all the fans that have made Queen a legend. We also hope that we can set an example for all the aspiring female rockers out there, showing that girls can “party on” too!</p>
<p>As a band, we’ve been through a lot together. But one of the great things about being in a band is that we come together and support one another. This music video is one of our biggest goals, and we’re eager to take on this new challenge. Now, with your help, we’re ready to finally make our dreams a reality!</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Making a music video is a long process with a lot of different steps. Here’s some of the nitty-gritty details:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$6,000 – Car. </strong>The first big expense of this video is getting ahold of our biggest and most important prop: a car! Because of the classic film we’re recreating, we need a very specific make and model of car. Getting the car has been quite an adventure, and in addition to the cost of the vehicle itself, we also have transport and repair expenses.</li>
<li>
<strong>$5,000 – Videographer</strong> <strong>and film crew</strong>. We need a videographer and crew who truly understand the classic look of such an iconic piece. These won’t be your run of the mill local crew. We will be working with one of the best in the business who have created music videos for bands such as Garbage and Chainsmokers. We want to do this right.</li>
<li>
<strong>$2,750 – Studio.</strong> Because of the nature of this video, we can’t film on location. We need to film in a studio, with a green screen and everything else a studio has to offer.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000 – Post-production/editing.</strong> Just like mastering an album, we need a team dedicated to lining up each shot to make an impact. This work takes long hours and the best software, but it also needs the intuition of an artist.</li>
<li>
<strong>$250 – Costumes and makeup.</strong> Lucky for us the costumes are simple for most of it, and the other scene will include many of the same costumes we wear on stage! We do need a few things to make it pop and none of it will go to waste.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>One of the main reasons we are creating this video, aside from our intense fangirling, is to grab the attention of promoters across the nation and the world. We are hoping to turn the momentum behind our video into a nationwide and international tour. We want to find the Queen fans of every city and nation. We want to inspire young women to embrace rock and roll. We want the world to get on your bikes and ride!!</p>
<p>Queen has inspired generations to be themselves and not worry what everyone else thinks. We chose to tribute Queen because the world needs this music. We are entering a time full of fear and hate. The world is a very different place now, and we want to bring a smile to those who need it most.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>In the music industry, you must always expect the unexpected. While we don’t anticipate any major bumps or hurdles, we know from experience that things can go wrong, and we’re prepared to modify our plan as we go to fit any changing circumstances.</p>
<p>The most obvious concern is that we won’t reach our funding goal. We have every intention of making this video happen with whatever funds we receive. However, certain aspects of the video would be need to be scaled back if we don’t meet our goal. Operating on a lower budget would likely force us to rethink our choices regarding the studio, videographer, and post-production.</p>
<p>Essentially, we plan to make the video we have the budget for. There is an upside to this plan: if we were to exceed our funding goal, it means we have some “wiggle room” to make the video even more amazing!</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>The best way that you can help us is to share this campaign and let the world know that we exist. Every musical endeavor needs eyes on it. Sometimes that’s not easy for the musicians themselves to do. Our die-hard fans are some of the greatest people in our lives. They help pick us up when the limelight blinds us. Tributing one of the greatest rock bands in the world can be overwhelming and intimidating, but we always rise to the challenge. We want to share that hard work with the world and celebrate the greatest music ever written!</p>

</div><p><b>My Story</b></p>
<p>My real name is Andre' Collins,
but I go by the stage name of Trump Tight.  I am a writer/producer/artist
that composes music of all genres.  I have written everything from love
ballads, to gospel songs, to hip-hop and everything in between.  I firmly
believe that good music is good music; it does not need to be defined by a
genre.  </p>
<p>I have always been a writer and
performer locally, but I got my TRUE industry start by working at a demo studio
in Nashville, TN where writers would come in with their songs to be recorded
with the hopes of pitching their songs to major labels. We would record those
songs and I would produce and sometimes co-arrange their songs to provide the
best sounding song possible for them to pitch.  The studio primarily recorded
live instruments and sounds, so that is where I honed my skills and fell in
love with the art of arranging and layering songs.</p>
<p>I am now preparing to release my
sophomore album entitled, ""Eclectic Soul"".  It is a hip-hop
album, infused with many elements of other sectors of music.  In the
truest sense of being eclectic, there will be songs with elements of R &amp; B,
pop, gospel, and techno all molded together into a wonderful arrangement
of artistry.  I have been told that I make ""hip-hop for grown
people"".  All of the songs have been recorded and we are in the
mixing and mastering stages. I am teaming up with multi-platinum mixer Marc
Frigo to provide the best sound yet!  I have worked with Marc on a few
other songs in various styles and each time he has delivered a phenomenal sound
that really brought the songs to life.  I think he is going to really add
the final element to push this project to the next level.  The versatility
and content of this album truly have the ability to make a MAJOR impact and is
sure to please whoever listens.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The recording of the
album has been completed so the funding of this project is solely for the
purpose of paying for the mixing, mastering, and launching of the album.
 The goal of the campaign is to generate enough pre-orders to pay for the
album and the second music video to officially launch the album.  Because myself
and a partner shoot and edit our own music videos, we are able to operate off
of a smaller budget than most, but our quality does not suffer as you can see
by the first music video from this album, ""Good Morning Amerikkka"".

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>I make music with the
intent to make an impact on the music industry and people's lives.  I have
songs on this album dealing with race relations in America (Good Morning
Amerikkka), abuse and bullying (Beauty Queen), a song dedicated to the brave
men and women in the Armed Forces (Till I Get Home), and other
impactful songs musically.  With your support, I will do my best to
spread this music around the globe.  You will have contributed to one of
the most original hip-hop albums to date.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The risks and challenges
are oftentimes the same for indie artists.  With no major label funding
the project, sales are often times the only way to make up the gap in finances.
 I work a full time job and have a family but I still have a dream.  In
order to accomplish this dream, I will need to rely on the kindness of others
and my fans to release this album.  </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Please check out all of the perks that are
listed on my campaign site. Contributing to this campaign will make my dream a
reality.  Words cannot truly describe the appreciation I have for your
support.  I promise to no end, I will do my best to make great music, push
the envelope, and to make an impact.  Even if you are unable to contribute
financially to this album at this time, I encourage you to share my campaign
with all of your friends.  I will not let you down. Thank you!</p><p></p></div>","My Story

The Impact
I make music with the
intent to make an impact on the music industry and people's lives.  I have
songs on this album dealing with race relations in America (Good Morning
Amerikkka), abuse and bullying (Beauty Queen), a song dedicated to the brave
men and women in the Armed Forces (Till I Get Home), and other
impactful songs musically.  With your support, I will do my best to
spread this music around the globe.  You will have contributed to one of
the most original hip-hop albums to date.
Risks & Challenges
The risks and challenges
are oftentimes the same for indie artists.  With no major label funding
the project, sales are often times the only way to make up the gap in finances.
 I work a full time job and have a family but I still have a dream.  In
order to accomplish this dream, I will need to rely on the kindness of others
and my fans to release this album.  
Other Ways You Can Help
Please check out all of the perks that are
listed on my campaign site. Contributing to this campaign will make my dream a
reality.  Words cannot truly describe the appreciation I have for your
support.  I promise to no end, I will do my best to make great music, push
the envelope, and to make an impact.  Even if you are unable to contribute
financially to this album at this time, I encourage you to share my campaign
with all of your friends.  I will not let you down. Thank you!",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

We have been in business for 1 year as of April 1st. We've done some amazing things so far and will continue to do so. </p>
<p>Our goal with this campaign is to strengthen our ability to continue developing and supporting our local music scene. We've been bringing bands of all sorts to Winchester every week and giving this town somewhere they know that they can always enjoy live music. Bands love playing here because we treat them well and ensure they know that they are a priceless and integral part of the music scene. Listeners love coming to Valley Cat because you can't find the type of music or atmosphere anywhere else in town or near by. This campaign is to help us continue to create the most excellent experience for all and nurture our music scene.</p>

This campaign and those who contribute will allow us to reach more people, bring more popular acts to play and so much more. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need at least $3,000 to accomplish the following:</p>
<p>1. We are moving to a new building this spring and will be kicking into overdrive. This means we will be back with WAY more shows, WAY more videos and WAY more Valley Cat. We will need help to o<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">btain a more professional PA system to provide a listening experience that is more comfortable and clear for both bands &amp; patrons.</span></p>
<p>2. We will be launching a live streaming video service so that you can experience great music from bands at Valley Cat anywhere you want... LIVE! We'd like some help to get the right equipment, an encoder, bigger board &amp; more.</p>
<p>For being the awesome person that you are and contributing, we have a lot of great perks to choose from. With small contribution rewards like a Valley Cat bumper sticker or a T-Shirt, middle-tier options like a live show pass to get into shows for free for a given time frame, high-tier options with combinations of the smaller tiers and adviser roles, there's something for everyone! </p>

<p><b><u>The
Need</u></b></p>
<p>The ability to use one's hands and
feet independently while performing is one of the benchmarks of good set
drummers. A driving bass drum is often another one, depending on musical
style. I developed an electro-mechanically assisted (""EMA"") bass
drum pedal with older drummers in mind, whose legs have lost their speed and/or
endurance (like me). For drummers who want to execute repetitively fast beats,
this pedal also frees their other foot, e.g. to operate their high-hat.</p>
<p>However, through accident or illness
many drummers have lost the use of one or both legs. Friends who are
handicapped are the catalyst for modifying the EMA so that disabled or
handicapped drummers can add the bass drum back to their playing using head
motion. </p>
<p><b><u>Objectives</u></b></p>
<p>The objectives of this campaign are
to:</p>
<p>1)  Refine
existing prototype electronics and software to improve the consistency with
which the bass drum is struck and to eliminate unintentional false positives
(""artifacts"").</p>
<p>2)  Make it
easier for the drummer to program-in functions, e.g. change and set a different
tempo on the fly; change the dynamic range; actuate an auxiliary device; etc.</p>
<p>3)  Develop
a Graphic User Interface (""GUI"") to facilitate selection of
performance parameters.</p>
<p>4)  Improve
the beater mounting system.</p>
<p>5)  Produce
5 prototypes to enable select drummers to evaluate the design and provide their
comments toward making the design more useful.</p>
<p>a.  Via local
contacts, and </p>
<p>b.  Trips to Georgia, Florida, and
California</p>
<p>6) 
Incorporate design changes and improvements.</p>
<p>7)  Produce
20 systems to distribute at no charge to handicapped drummers and to select
music therapy schools and centers.</p>
<p><b><u>The Story</u></b></p>
<p>I’m 69 and have
played drums since I was 9. While it helped to pay my way through college
playing in a soul band, after college I mainly focused on playing timpani in
orchestras. But being an active drummer, I have also played in a bagpipe band
(competing in the World Championships in Glasgow), concert bands and brass
ensembles. As I got older and further away from playing set with any
regularity, I found my foot coordination lacking and my leg tiring. Hence the
idea for the EMA bass drum pedal to avoid embarrassing myself.</p>
<p>The EMA system
consists of a pedal, electronics box, and solenoid assembly.  A sensor
mounted to the pedal starts the solenoid striking the bass drum head at
whatever tempo the drummer selects. Pressing the pedal further causes the
solenoid to strike the head harder. The solenoid stops striking the bass head
once foot pressure is released. This lets a drummer produce complex patterns on
the fly, at faster speeds than would be typically possible and with much less
leg fatigue.</p>
<p>Professional,
name drummers who have seen the EMA system have been enthusiastic and
encouraging. I have not taken it to market because with the exception of
replacing sticks, most older drummers simply don’t buy new equipment.</p>
<p>My last full
time job involved the international marketing and sale of airborne imaging systems,
primarily to governments for use in environmental monitoring as a means of
linking satellite data with ground-truthed data. These systems were line
scanners. Just as old TVs produced images by sweeping a series of lines across
a CRT, the line scanners collected data line by line usually from a small twin
engine plane. Since changes of air pressure due to winds or thermals bounce
small planes around, virtually no two lines were parallel. Therefore the
collected data had to be corrected for aircraft motion (roll, pitch and yaw).</p>
<p>I hold the

<p><span>·<span>

the system that effectively corrected the images, enabling them to be laid over

<p><br/></p></div>","The
Need
The ability to use one's hands and
feet independently while performing is one of the benchmarks of good set
drummers. A driving bass drum is often another one, depending on musical
style. I developed an electro-mechanically assisted (""EMA"") bass
drum pedal with older drummers in mind, whose legs have lost their speed and/or
endurance (like me). For drummers who want to execute repetitively fast beats,
this pedal also frees their other foot, e.g. to operate their high-hat.
However, through accident or illness
many drummers have lost the use of one or both legs. Friends who are
handicapped are the catalyst for modifying the EMA so that disabled or
handicapped drummers can add the bass drum back to their playing using head
motion. 
Objectives
The objectives of this campaign are
to:
1)  Refine
existing prototype electronics and software to improve the consistency with
which the bass drum is struck and to eliminate unintentional false positives
(""artifacts"").
2)  Make it
easier for the drummer to program-in functions, e.g. change and set a different
tempo on the fly; change the dynamic range; actuate an auxiliary device; etc.
3)  Develop
a Graphic User Interface (""GUI"") to facilitate selection of
performance parameters.
4)  Improve
the beater mounting system.
5)  Produce
5 prototypes to enable select drummers to evaluate the design and provide their
comments toward making the design more useful.
a.  Via local
contacts, and 
b.  Trips to Georgia, Florida, and
California
6) 
Incorporate design changes and improvements.
7)  Produce
20 systems to distribute at no charge to handicapped drummers and to select
music therapy schools and centers.
The Story
I’m 69 and have
played drums since I was 9. While it helped to pay my way through college
playing in a soul band, after college I mainly focused on playing timpani in
orchestras. But being an active drummer, I have also played in a bagpipe band
(competing in the World Championships in Glasgow), concert bands and brass

The EMA system
consists of a pedal, electronics box, and solenoid assembly.  A sensor
mounted to the pedal starts the solenoid striking the bass drum head at
whatever tempo the drummer selects. Pressing the pedal further causes the
solenoid to strike the head harder. The solenoid stops striking the bass head
once foot pressure is released. This lets a drummer produce complex patterns on
the fly, at faster speeds than would be typically possible and with much less
leg fatigue.
Professional,

I am a singer/songwriter from San Diego, California and have been studying in Boston at the Berklee College of Music since I arrived in 2015. When I first came to Berklee, I was extremely shy about sharing my music, but knew that it was just something I had to do. I rounded up a group of extremely talented musicians who helped me create CC’s sound and finished compositions. We hired a fantastic manager, Kate Rancka, recorded our first five singles to be released in 2017, and started playing live shows all over Boston. We managed to accomplish all of this in a matter of months due to the hard work of many people that sacrificed their time to be a part of my artistic vision. I can’t tell you how grateful I am to be working with such gracious and talented individuals. </p><p>When our first single, “Blow,” was released last March, we received an overwhelming response. In the first week of its release, the song had accumulated over 10,000 views, plays, and shares. This was a wonderful shock and even more motivation to put out new music. Writing, collaborating with things that I’m not sure we’ll ever be able to stop doing - we certainly don’t want to. Yes, being the bandleader of ten musicians has been exhausting, and yes, I am crazy, but this has been extremely rewarding and the greatest learning experience I’ve ever endured. </p><p> </p><h2>Where Your Funds Go</h2><p>This campaign was established in order to reimburse the musicians who financially contributed to the creation of our first five singles. Creating recorded music involves many bodies: the mixer, masterer, sound engineer, tuner, videographer, etc. In addition to reimbursing for current projects, we would like to invest the exceeding funds in our future endeavors. Creating an Indiegogo campaign was a great avenue to allow us to continue to share music and our artistic vision. </p><p>New music to be released in Fall has already been written and is in the arranging stage. We plan on recording our next set of songs outside of Berklee’s studios. This process is more expensive than recording on-campus at Berklee, however we need to do so in order to retain full copyrights of our music. With this in mind, your funds would also be supporting our effort to retain all rights to our sound recordings! </p><p> </p><h2>Gifts for Your Generosity</h2><p>Your contributions to our artistic vision are precious to us and we cannot thank you enough for your generosity. We would like to offer your gifts at all levels of donation. In order to view these gifts and their descriptions, please view the “Perks” bar on the right hand side of the page.

I can’t tell you how grateful I am to be working with such gracious and talented individuals. When our first single, “Blow,” was released last March, we received an overwhelming response. In the first week of its release, the song had accumulated over 10,000 views, plays, and shares. This was a wonderful shock and even more motivation to put out new music. Writing, collaborating with things that I’m not sure we’ll ever be able to stop doing - we certainly don’t want to. Yes, being the bandleader of ten musicians has been exhausting, and yes, I am crazy, but this has been extremely rewarding and the greatest learning experience I’ve ever endured.  Where Your Funds GoThis campaign was established in order to reimburse the musicians who financially contributed to the creation of our first five singles. Creating recorded music involves many bodies: the mixer, masterer, sound engineer, tuner, videographer, etc. In addition to reimbursing for current projects, we would like to invest the exceeding funds in our future endeavors. Creating an Indiegogo campaign was a great avenue to allow us to continue to share music and our artistic vision. New music to be released in Fall has already been written and is in the arranging stage. We plan on recording our next set of songs outside of Berklee’s studios. This process is more expensive than recording on-campus at Berklee, however we need to do so in order to retain full copyrights of our music. With this in mind, your funds would also be supporting our effort to retain all rights to our sound recordings!  Gifts for Your GenerosityYour contributions to our artistic vision are precious to us and we cannot thank you enough for your generosity. We would like to offer your gifts at all levels of donation. In order to view these gifts and their descriptions, please view the “Perks” bar on the right hand side of the page. Thank you again from everyone here at CC & The Catastrophe!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Rosado. I currently work in full time ministry with a youth group in Central FL. I am married to my incredible wife, Kati. We have a sleepy Shiba Inu and a love for finding ""home"" on our travels with those that we meet. Coffee and surfing are truly passions of mine. Let’s have a conversation.</p>
<p>I’ve seen and met many in the midst of their journey that have watched the days go by while they remain in their regrets, the fear of failure that holds them back from dreams and joy. I was 18 when I knew a specific calling on my life was to share poetry- not only the words but the songs that also have come from them.</p>
<p>A few years later, Wind Words became the vehicle by which I would travel and share in hopes that life would be spoken through my songs. The incredible support and friendships gained from show-goers, listeners and other artists have kept me encouraged to say the least. I’ve continued to be inspired by the stories and memories that have been shared with me. This year I have been given a burden to share a few of those stories with the world.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to take this poetry project into a studio with Mark Nicks and Brandon Shattuck and to have these songs professionally recorded and produced at Parafonic Recording Studio in Orlando FL.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo Campaign is a new step toward this direction. I am opening my efforts as an invitation to partner with friends and family to see this full length record become all that it can be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>3500 is the cost of recording this project (Tracking+Mixing+Mastering)</p>
<p>100+ is the cost of having World Wide Distribution: music copy-written and then distributed onto all major platforms (such as Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube.. ect)</p>
<p>The rest will cover new merch and perk supplies to gift you with media and souvenirs in the production of this album.</p>
<p>Perks for backers will include Digital Downloads of 2 Pre-released singles, Full Length Digital Download,  New shirts, Posters, Stickers, Physical Cds, Merch Bundles, Hand Written Lyrics to 1 song of your choice, House Shows… +more</p>
<p>This is a ""Flexible Funding"" project which means that all funds will help support the project no matter how much is raised even if the goal is not met.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE HEART</h3>
<p>These are uncharted waters for me but I can assure you that this project will be met with my utmost diligence and energy no matter how much is raised. These songs must be shared and this album must be made. My promise to you is this: “I will creatively communicate hope and unconditional love and life through this project with all that I can give.”</p>
<p>There is enough content out there that consumes our lives and fills our news feeds. But what about that which stirs contentment? ""Digging Up Earth"" is an album that shares of seasons and perspectives that may connect or may introduce the listener to matters of pain, doubt, holiness, faith and transparency. Everyone is worth a conversation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Financially backing this project is just amazing and I am sincerely grateful for those who can... but this is not the only way to show your support. I would like to encourage you to get the word out about this campaign even if you cannot physically give. Also take advantage of Indiegogo’s share tools that make it incredibly easy for you to use your social media influence. Thoughts and prayers are always asked for and welcomed. Gracias!</p>

<p><strong>Under The Same Sun</strong></p>
<p>Under the Same Sun is an album that with your help I will record in the Songkites Studio, Cambodia. Songkites is a Therapeutic Music Project created together with Euan Gray that aims to nurture creative expression, leadership and community through songwriting, production and performance with young people in Cambodia and post-conflict contexts around the world.</p>
<p>I believe music and songwriting is a powerful way of expressing, communicating and making sense of the difficult things we face in this world.</p>
<p>For the past 15 years, I have been working in conflict and post-conflict zones as a Creative Arts Therapist and had the privilege to journey with people who face all kinds of traumas and challenges. I have found that each of these people have within them the capacity to transform these experiences into beauty and powerful art. It is their stories, my stories and the collective stories of this world that I want to give voice to through the art of songwriting.</p>
<p>I have written an album of songs on issues such as: refugees and forced migration, human trafficking and abuse, relationships, loss, managing change and transition. </p>
<p>The songs are ready! I am now building a community of supporters to help me to make this project possible. I have an amazing band and producer already onboard. All I need is YOU!</p>
<p>With your support I will be able to: record the album with an amazing band and our Songkites producer, Euan Gray; make a music video involving people around the world; bring the music to you through live gigs, presentations and therapeutic songwriting workshops. It will help the research and development of therapeutic songwriting processes that all feeds into our therapeutic songwriting project, Songkites here in Cambodia. You can be part of making this possible. You might even want to have a song written especially for you, or for a situation or person you deeply care about. I love taking photographs of our beautiful world and am sharing a collection of sunset photos as posters and canvas prints – you might want to bring the warmth of the sun into your home or office, or give as a gift to someone special in your life.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>It matters to me that people know where their funding and support is going. I want to be transparent about the budget and who is involved. </p>
<p>I need to raise $10,000 This will be used for Session Musicians, Music Production, Mixing &amp; Mastering, Studio Hire &amp; Overheads, Video Production, Design and Artwork. </p>
<p>There are lots of ways you can contribute, and here through this campaign you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join a community to support the development of Therapeutic Songwriting,</li>
<li>Pre-purchase the album and receive it before anyone else through a digital download,</li>
<li>Receive a poster or canvas print of a sunset image of your choice, </li>
<li>Invest in the first music video I have ever created that will also involve many people around the world in its production,</li>
<li>Host a gig* in your home town (this can be a living room gig, one in your organisation or community, or in a cafe or music venue),</li>
<li>Host a presentation* about therapeutic songwriting.</li>
<li>Host a therapeutic songwriting workshop* for your community or organisation,</li>
<li>Commission a therapeutic song to be written for a person or a cause that matters to you</li>
<li>Everyone who contributes will be thanked in the album credits and on social media. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't reach the entire goal we will do a smaller version of the Album as I committed to making as much of this happen as possible.</p>
<p>*For all gigs, presentations and workshops – I am planning to travel over the next year on a work and research sabbatical – I will endeavor to honour as many requests as is possible and may need some support with practical overheads in some contexts (please feel free to contact me to discuss if you are interested in any of these perks and are not in my usual travel route (South Asia, Europe)!).</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The opportunity to do this project is so valuable to me and the development of our therapeutic songwriting project Songkites in Cambodia and other post conflict areas around the world. </li>
<li>I have made a small EP before and this will be my first studio album and music video.</li>
<li>It will give me opportunity to bring these songs and the issues raised to a much wider audience.</li>
<li>It will build a community of people interested in supporting therapeutic songwriting initiatives around the world.</li>
</ul>

</div><p> </p></div>","Under The Same Sun
Under the Same Sun is an album that with your help I will record in the Songkites Studio, Cambodia. Songkites is a Therapeutic Music Project created together with Euan Gray that aims to nurture creative expression, leadership and community through songwriting, production and performance with young people in Cambodia and post-conflict contexts around the world.
I believe music and songwriting is a powerful way of expressing, communicating and making sense of the difficult things we face in this world.
For the past 15 years, I have been working in conflict and post-conflict zones as a Creative Arts Therapist and had the privilege to journey with people who face all kinds of traumas and challenges. I have found that each of these people have within them the capacity to transform these experiences into beauty and powerful art. It is their stories, my stories and the collective stories of this world that I want to give voice to through the art of songwriting.
I have written an album of songs on issues such as: refugees and forced migration, human trafficking and abuse, relationships, loss, managing change and transition. 
The songs are ready! I am now building a community of supporters to help me to make this project possible. I have an amazing band and producer already onboard. All I need is YOU!
With your support I will be able to: record the album with an amazing band and our Songkites producer, Euan Gray; make a music video involving people around the world; bring the music to you through live gigs, presentations and therapeutic songwriting workshops. It will help the research and development of therapeutic songwriting processes that all feeds into our therapeutic songwriting project, Songkites here in Cambodia. You can be part of making this possible. You might even want to have a song written especially for you, or for a situation or person you deeply care about. I love taking photographs of our beautiful world and am sharing a collection of sunset photos as posters and canvas prints – you might want to bring the warmth of the sun into your home or office, or give as a gift to someone special in your life.
What We Need & What You Get
It matters to me that people know where their funding and support is going. I want to be transparent about the budget and who is involved. 
I need to raise $10,000 This will be used for Session Musicians, Music Production, Mixing & Mastering, Studio Hire & Overheads, Video Production, Design and Artwork. 
There are lots of ways you can contribute, and here through this campaign you can:

Join a community to support the development of Therapeutic Songwriting,
Pre-purchase the album and receive it before anyone else through a digital download,
Receive a poster or canvas print of a sunset image of your choice, 
Invest in the first music video I have ever created that will also involve many people around the world in its production,
Host a gig* in your home town (this can be a living room gig, one in your organisation or community, or in a cafe or music venue),
Host a presentation* about therapeutic songwriting.
Host a therapeutic songwriting workshop* for your community or organisation,
Commission a therapeutic song to be written for a person or a cause that matters to you
Everyone who contributes will be thanked in the album credits and on social media. 

 
If we don't reach the entire goal we will do a smaller version of the Album as I committed to making as much of this happen as possible.
*For all gigs, presentations and workshops – I am planning to travel over the next year on a work and research sabbatical – I will endeavor to honour as many requests as is possible and may need some support with practical overheads in some contexts (please feel free to contact me to discuss if you are interested in any of these perks and are not in my usual travel route (South Asia, Europe)!).
The Impact

The opportunity to do this project is so valuable to me and the development of our therapeutic songwriting project Songkites in Cambodia and other post conflict areas around the world. 
I have made a small EP before and this will be my first studio album and music video.
It will give me opportunity to bring these songs and the issues raised to a much wider audience.
It will build a community of people interested in supporting therapeutic songwriting initiatives around the world.

Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Dear friends:</p>
<p>On June 23-25 I will be finally producing a long-cherished project: <i>Pieces of CANE/ KABNIS!</i> - a musical and interdisciplinary adaptation of Jean Toomer’s Harlem Renaissance masterpiece. Developed in collaboration with director Jacqui Parker and video artist Kate Matson, <i>KABNIS! </i>brings this radical (and timely) text into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>I have worked with the <i>CANE</i> for more than three decades as both an educator and as a creative musician. “Kabnis” - the third and final section of Jean Toomer’s 1923 experimental novel – is a long short story which tells the story of a Northern black “intellectual” who is about to end his troubled sojourn as a teacher at a rural, segregated Georgia school for black children. Jean Toomer’s attempts to reconstruct the meanings of race and the consequences of racial identity formation at the beginning of a post-Reconstruction early 20th century really does resonate in our 21st century of global mass communication and international Hip-Hop nation. The gothic horror of the ways in which fear of lynching insinuates itself into the mundane and social and sexual relations of a community of black men and women in the rural south in the 1920’s is the dramatic engine that drives the narrative. And this gothic horror narrative feels ever more relevant today. We must provide the next generation with the tools to create positive articulations about the negative energies and histories that created the complex world in which we live.</p>
<p>This project is about creative choices and positive manipulations of an existing textual masterpiece. Those poems which call for rendering as songs will be so treated. Likewise, the longer, narrative poems are to be performed as dance pieces with the evocation of the poem in duet with instrumental music. The cast features nine brilliant actors: Born Bikim, Bill Bruce, Jermaine Hamilton, Candis Hilton, Anthony  Hinds, Jorge Lopes, Myisha  Rodrigues-Scott, Brian Savage, and Andrea Whitfield. The music is performed by my own eight-piece Signifyin’ Natives Ensemble, including Wesley Brown (bass), Taylor Ho Bynum (cornet), John Kordalewski (piano), Ron Mahdi (bass), Jason Robinson (saxophones), Warren Smith (percussion), and Patrice Williamson (vocals). The core musicians are all master improvisers and long-time collaborators, so we get the full “Ellington” effect: not of Ellington’s unique sound but Ellington’s unique understanding of improvisation and personality as a compositional tool. I also share long collaborative histories with director Jacqui Parker and animator Kate Matson in a wide variety of productions and venues. This is my core creative team. The creation of <i>Pieces of CANE/KABNIS!</i> is a gathering of forces and a focus of my life’s work in music, theater and literature.</p>
<p>If you share my reverence for this extraordinary text, if you share my enthusiasm for these wonderful collaborators, if you share my belief that we need to keep reexamining and reimagining the classics to find their contemporary resonances - please consider supporting this project. This is truly a culminating work of my own artistic journey; something I feel I’ve been working towards for decades. The donor perks include some fun musical treats and thank yous – but also some great chances to engage with the artists. We want you to be part of the team, part of the process, and part of the conversation. Please support us and/or come join us Friday, Saturday or Sunday, June 23, 24 and 25, in Boston, as we coax Toomer’s characters to come to life on the Hibernian stage, 184 Dudley Street in Roxbury. (All performances begin promptly at 8:00 pm.)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and please spread the word! Peace,</p>

It all began when i started thinking of ways that i could better my very small community here in Hazlehurst, GA. Here in this small town music and art have never ""taken off"", though hundreds of people play instruments here. Overtime i would go hear someone local or see videos of people playing from this area there has been one thing in common... a lack of an excellent production. The music will be really great but the sound systems have been far from even ok. I have been slowly building up my own system and tools to make music great in this community but have come to a halt. The reason I need your help making the next big leap is to push my small company into the the realm of excellence. I want to be able to provide non-profits and small town folks the ability to have an amazing live performance. Hopefully you can help me achieve this goal.

If you donate more than $400 you will get to experience the system first hand. There are a ton of perks that I am offering to those who give. Even those that cannot give a lot I will even be giving you a little something.</li> <li>What happens if i don't reach my goal of $6000? Every penny I get will go towards purchasing this sound system.

Overtime i would go hear someone local or see videos of people playing from this area there has been one thing in common... a lack of an excellent production. The music will be really great but the sound systems have been far from even ok. I have been slowly building up my own system and tools to make music great in this community but have come to a halt. The reason I need your help making the next big leap is to push my small company into the the realm of excellence. I want to be able to provide non-profits and small town folks the ability to have an amazing live performance. Hopefully you can help me achieve this goal. To make music great in Hazlehurst, GA.   What We Need & What You Get  I am looking at trying to raise 6000$. Woah! that sounds like a lot but let me tell you what you as a contributor are helping accomplish. So with this money I am going to purchase a top of the line sound system. If you donate more than $400 you will get to experience the system first hand. There are a ton of perks that I am offering to those who give. Even those that cannot give a lot I will even be giving you a little something. What happens if i don't reach my goal of $6000? Every penny I get will go towards purchasing this sound system. Even if we do not reach the goal at once i will keep pursuing this because I want to see a great production come out of little ole Hazlehurst.

</div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">""The concept of this album really grew out of my own disillusionment with the modern idea of love that I saw was so prevalent- that people in our lives should make us happy, and if they don't, we should cut them out and find new people who do make us happy. This idea bothered me. Where is the richness of relationship if I've never walked with someone through their darkest hour? How does the love in my heart ever expand and grow stronger if I only love people who are easy to love...if I only love people when they are healthy? And I came to the conclusion that I don't believe in Happy-Love. I believe love can make us happier than anything else in the world, yes, but I don't believe that happiness is the same as love. I think the highest form of love can be found in loving someone who is sick, and not just under-the-weather-sick, but so sick they aren't even the same person you loved in the beginning. So sick they can't love you back. That kind of love doesn't usually make you happy. It cleanses and purifies you through and through, and you come face to face with your own sickness along the way, but in the end you'll find the most surprising gift in another's sickness: you'll find health. You loved someone who was unable to love you back and somehow you became more loved than you've ever been. You stood by someone in their sickness and you both came away healthy. </span><br/>

</h3>We're a ""lyrically refreshing and musically diverse"" Roots-Folk duo and we've been touring our original music throughout North America since 2013. Since <a href=""http://www.danandlaurel.ca/Bio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">finding each other</a> and joining forces we've played hundreds of house concerts, concert series', and theaters, and recently we've been getting noticed by festival programmers. It seems we may be on to something.<br/><br/>With audiences buying up our previous two Dan and Laurel albums to the point where we often have to run to the car for more, it's time to step it up and also get our music out to radio and print media. Added to the costs of recording and manufacturing a new album, launching a publicity campaign is expensive and time consuming. We fell short on publicity funding with our second album, and don't want to do that with this one. We'd love to be able to finally hire a helper or two!<br/><br/>We've recently recorded twelve new original songs which together create our most ambitious project to date. We are very excited to share these particular creations on a third album, entitled ""Between The Rain"" at our official CD release April 27th and to take it on the road for tours already booked through the end of the year. We hope you'll take this chance to pre-order the record and help make it possible!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Based on past experience and a successfully funded campaign for our second album, we've estimated that we need $7,500 to make our third release the best it can be while staying true to the sound and quality we envision and our growing fan base expects.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>-Recording/Mixing/Mastering ~ $3000</p>
<p>-Studio Musicians ~ $350</p>
<p>-Manufacturing 1000 CD's ~ $1250</p>
<p>-CD Graphic Design ~ $150</p>
<p>-Album Photography ~ $250</p>
<p>-Publicity in print and radio for initial US and Canadian CD release tours ~ $2500</p>Donations of any amount are appreciated and if you pledge $25 or more you will receive the new album in the mail by June 2016. In addition, we have many other valuable rewards for you to enjoy, including violin, guitar, or songwriting lessons, having us guest record on your next album, music for your next party or event, and digital access to our combined 42 years of individual discographies.<br/><br/>Should we receive more than our target amount (many artists ask for 15-25K to record a new album) we will be able to spend more time in the studio as needed to ensure that each new song gets the treatment it deserves. We'll also have a serious budget for marketing our latest release and a budget for creating other merchandise we hope you'll enjoy and appreciate.<br/><br/>If we <b>do not</b> reach our fundraising goal, we will use any funds received to switch gears and either record an EP with the best of these twelve songs (don't even want to think about having to choose...), or find ways to cut costs even more and scale back so we can still share the full length record. Regardless, should the worst case scenario become a reality, we will communicate our new direction to everyone who has pledged, fulfill all gifts associated with the campaign, and still have some form of new music to share with you this Spring.<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Both now in our 30s, we've been making our livings as professional musicians since we were teenagers. We've both struggled through and overcome times that challenged our belief in our musical life paths and we live a frugal and simple life that affords us the ability to keep touring and sharing what we love. <br/></p>
<p>We've also both enjoyed past successes - through previous albums funded and released, as educators, and as people who consistently <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcNsxzmRdvE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">touch the hearts and minds of audiences</a> and our music students. Through experience, we know that a professional studio treatment of what we believe are some of our best songs and compositions, as well as a budget to market such a release, at this point in our careers, would help us reach people who want to be moved, who want to laugh, and who want to feel the hope and inspiration we feel through this music. <br/></p>
<p>We love the organic, word of mouth, under the radar approach because it has brought us true fans and many lifelong friends and home away from homes. However, we would also love the boost and credibility that a well recorded and marketed album could have, allowing us to hopefully spend more time working on our music, and less time trying to spark the interest of promoters who have never heard of us.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We have the studio arranged (Bear Creek Studio in Bonny Doon -  <a href=""http://bearcreekrecordingstudio.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://bearcreekrecordingstudio.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bearcreekrecordingstudio.net</a>), all the people required for production lined up, and a detailed timeline in place to ensure we are ready to release our new album in the States on April 27, 2016 and in Canada on our tour starting in May 2016. While we've factored in extra time for minor delays should they arise, we'd love to be able to completely focus on recording this album now, rather than whether or not funding will be available when we need to write the checks.<br/></p>
<p>We are highly creative, motivated, and problem solving 
individuals, and have released over 25 albums between us in the past, mostly on very low budgets. Should one door close, we are confident that we'd quickly find 
another to walk through. We're well prepared and well rehearsed to record these songs and are confident that many of them can be recorded live-off-the-floor in one take. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Whether or not you are financially able to pre-order the new album and contribute to it's creation at this time, we'd appreciate your help sharing this campaign with the music lovers and supporters in your life! Indiegogo makes sharing to mailing lists and social media as easy as clicking the appropriate links to the left of our campaign video above. <br/></p>
<p>We're also booking shows through into 2017 at this time, and pre-buying music for your event - wedding, party, launch - is a wonderful way to give us a bigger boost right now when we most need it. And while we'd be tickled if you chose to feature our original music, we are also well prepared to play hundreds if not thousands of Classical favorites and/or cover tunes. We'd be happy to send along a list of our extensive repertoire. Please send us a message at info@danandlaurel.ca and we can talk dates and options.</p>
<p>Finally, if you're a venue, house concert host, festival director, concert series, radio DJ, or music camp, we'd love to arrange to share our new CD with you in concert. Once the album is in hand, the real work of spreading it far and wide begins! We'll be touring the Western US, South, East Coast, New England, and coast to coast throughout Canada in 2016. We hope you can be an integral part of our journey!<br/></p>

<br/><h3>Rachel's Debut Album<br/>
</h3>Hi, my name is Rachel Knowles.  Singing and entertaining people are my passions. So, I am beginning a journey that includes recording my first album.
<p>I am 13 years old and an 8th grade student. I have been singing and dancing since before I can remember. I have been taking dance classes since I was 3 years old and performing in recitals, talent shows, and dance competitions since.  I have been singing in school choruses since 3rd grade. I sing in the worship team for the children's ministry at my church.<br/></p>
<p>I recently started writing songs and singing more and discovered that I love it.  One of my biggest dreams is to become a Christian pop singer. I want to motivate other young people to pursue their dreams and overcome adversities. Singing and songwriting is the new direction I see myself going with my life.  My music styles include Christian Contemporary, pop, and alternative.</p>

Hi, my name is Rachel Knowles.  Singing and entertaining people are my passions. So, I am beginning a journey that includes recording my first album.
I am 13 years old and an 8th grade student. I have been singing and dancing since before I can remember. I have been taking dance classes since I was 3 years old and performing in recitals, talent shows, and dance competitions since.  I have been singing in school choruses since 3rd grade. I sing in the worship team for the children's ministry at my church.
I recently started writing songs and singing more and discovered that I love it.  One of my biggest dreams is to become a Christian pop singer. I want to motivate other young people to pursue their dreams and overcome adversities. Singing and songwriting is the new direction I see myself going with my life.  My music styles include Christian Contemporary, pop, and alternative.
I am working with a local music producer and musician, Nick Coetzee with Rain Music Recording Studio (http://www.rainmusic.org). We recorded the song Oceans by Hillsong in my own style. This is one of my favorite songs and I wanted my initial song to be one that others are familiar with.  I have been writing several other songs that I want to record.    What I Need From You & What You Get Although I have supportive parents, family, and friends, they are not able to fully fund this project.

<p>Oh hello there, you look amazing! </p>
<p>How can we tell? Oh right, the internet told us through facial recognition. And you look fabulous. Excuse us while we sit down and introduce ourselves. I’m Jonah, the intellectual one. I’m Jonathan, the mischievous one. I’m Amy, the Asian one. And I’m Alex, the sassy yet shy one. United, we form the ever mighty, soulful-alt-indie-bluesy-poppy rockin’ quadratic known to many as The LoveHowl. </p>
<p>We have been a band for over 5 years based out of New York. We’ve had our music featured on tv, made The Deli’s Best Emerging Artists list, played countless shows, but have yet to release a full length album. And ladies and gents, you are in luck because that time…IS NOW. </p>
<p>We’ve been hard at work in the studio over the past year and can’t wait to finally share some new music with you. Our goal of $5,000 will go towards pressing this bad boy onto vinyl, the production costs for our first real music video, and new merch with the release of the record. As independent artists the costs of producing new material comes straight out of our own pockets so any contribution at all is a huge help.</p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>Your donation to our new album can get ya some nifty things ranging from signed vinyl, that merch we were just talking about, to some other interesting services. If you are reading this there is a pretty good chance you are an artist or aspiring artist yourself. We at The LoveHowl are a smorgasbord of creative services. So if you or someone you know may want a set of guitar lessons, studio time, or design services for the holidays why you are in luck, cause we can help with that! And you’ll be giving the gift of supporting independent music. It’s a win win for all! HO HO HO! If you are a super fan, (Oh hey! You’re awesome) we’re offering some holiday treats like mad prop name dropping on the album, covering a song of your choice and recording it, an in house show, plus dinner with the band. </p>
<p>Even if you’re unable to contribute at this time (which we totally understand) sharing is caring and appreciate the help by spreading the word! Tell your friends and fam that The LoveHowl is this handsome band straight outta Brooklyn and they could be a part of our first LP ever! Okay, now go get back to fighting evil and bringing joy to the world. You still look amazing, please share what hair products you are using. We love you.</p>
<p>Love,</p>

<h3>Alex Masi New Album in 2018</h3>
<p>I have released eight solo and five band albums (received a Grammy nomination in 1989), toured extensively all over the world both as a solo artist and with my bands. I have collaborated with many great artists both in the studio and on stage, the one I'm most proud to have been associated with is the late, great Allan Holdsworth who's been a huge hero of mine and a never ending influence since my teenage years. Musically speaking I've always been into all kinds of music, I started on the piano when I was kid and the classical influence is still there as clearly shown in my ""classical trilogy series"" (In the Name of...) where I recorded music by JS Bach, WA Mozart and LV Beethoven but I've also always been attracted to modern music with a high level of groove and Rock is where I've been feeling at home for a few decades now.</p>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>With this Indiegogo campaign I hope for the first time in my career to be actually independent from the various restrictions and obstacles one encounters when dealing with record labels at all levels. The freedom of knowing I can record the music I hear in my head without having some record company exec telling me what I should or shouldn't do is HUGE!</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CONTRIBUTION</strong></p>
<p>Contributors to my campaign will help achieve the goal of recording and releasing an album full of brand new music, something that's becoming more and more difficult to do in recent years due to the global phenomenon of digital downloads and piracy and the consequent effect it has had on the music industry and, more specifically, on the artists. Plus I plan on using a recording studio other than my home studio and finally record in the same room with the musicians, something I haven't been to do for a few years on my solo albums</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The money raised from this campaign will go to booking studio time, especially for recording drums, getting a great sounding room for the drums, a great drummer and the right engineers to capture the performance is critical to the success of an album. I'll also be hiring some great musicians to play with me on the record. Then right after the mixing and mastering the album will need artwork and, finally, pressing copies to send to you, contributors, first</li>
<li>I have a number of perks specifically associated to this project ranging from receiving the album before it's actually released, private 1 on 1 lessons, a guitar I've recorded with on previous albums and more</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Contributing to this project, I believe, will make you part of the effort that many musicians, like myself, are making in order to keep new music coming out. </li>
<li>My previous albums like Attack of the Neon Shark, the Bach, Mozart, Beethoven classical trilogy and the other ones have fared quite well both with critics and audiences around the world, even a Grammy nomination</li>
<li>With your help I plan on getting this project completed by  June 2018</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There won't be any time wasted in the studio like in the old days when with big budgets people felt like they could afford spending days writing parts in the studio, all the material will be ready to be recorded from day one.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.</li>
<li>Even if you wish you could contribute financially but you can't at the moment, please, feel free to spread the word around on social media, friends, fellow musicians etc I will deeply appreciate any help you guys out there can direct my way!</li>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Jason West. I am a movie cinematographer/ director/ producer. I am a graduate of the George A. Romero film making program at Douglas Education Center in Monessen, Pennsylvania. I graduated top of my class and received every award possible while I was in college. I have worked with movie legends such as Tom Savini, Doug Bradley, Josh Stewart, Dean Cain, Kevin Sorbo and much more. My goal is to bring to life a ""Creepshow"" like anthology of music videos from the world renowned horror punk band, Grave Robber. I have known this band since 2008, and I have been a huge fan since then. However, my passion alone will not get this project made, and that's why we need your help.</p>
<p>Grave Robber needs your help raising funds for their first ever anthology for their ""Escaping the Grave"" album. You will be treated with visuals from an amazing team of Tom Savini and George Romero's graduates along with new and fresh talent. You can expect to have the Hell scared out of you with these music videos.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you can do to help</h3>So basically, we need help from you (the fans). Our goal is $7000 and anything after that will go toward making this project even better. As you scroll down the right side of the screen you will notice the perk packages. The more you donate, the better the perk! All the items on the list have limits, so act fast so you can guarantee your merchandise. You will also notice a featured perk; a ""free"" concert within a 4 hour drive of the Fort Wayne, Indiana area. That's right, you could have Grave Robber playing a concert in your living room, or you could convince a local venue to have them play for just a $500 donation!!! So please share this with everyone you know!</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Look, we know how hard it is to open your wallet and take chances on a campaign like this. Just be assured that this anthology is for you, the fans. Not only are we doing this for the fans, but we are doing this in memory of George Romero. He is not only my mentor, but he is my hero and my inspiration to be the best film maker I can be.</p>
