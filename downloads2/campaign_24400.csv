<h3>What is WIPP?</h3>
<p>We are <strong>Work In Progress Productions</strong> (WIPP, for short) we are a non-profit theatre group orginating from Middle Island (Middle Island Presbyterian Church) and we're asking for your help to fund our upcoming Spring show <strong>""Working Title!""</strong> It is the <strong>10th anniversary</strong> of our group, which is why to kick off our upcoming season, our group decided to do something that is completely new to us...<strong> this will be our first self-written show!</strong> It is a script completely put together by the creative thoughts and styles of our very own cast members. You can imagine how much hard work and effort our cast put into such a show, which is why we'd want more than anything to see their thoughts come to life <strong>AND</strong> to be seen by all that can... Which is another new addition to our tenth year, our group is looking to tour to different venues for the first time in our ten year run! You can imagine how much effort our kids put into all of this, which is why we could really use any help we can get from all of our lovely supporters (<strong>THATS <em>YOU</em>!</strong>)</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need rental money for new spaces, new venues, all around our neighboring towns on Long Island.</li>
<li>We also need money for sets, costumes, props, and whatever else it is that brings the magic to the stage.</li>
<li>The more exposure we get, the more our group can grow, and the more we can entertain people like you for many more years to come!</li>
<li>If you donate, there can be wonderful gifts and prizes in it FOR YOU, right from the actors/producers/directors themselves! (<strong>MORE PERKS WILL BE ADDED TO THIS CAMPAIGN AS TIME PROGRESSES</strong>, it's still early, but the cast is currently thinking up ideas to please our funders who push the extra mile for us. So please donate all you can.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If we don't reach our goal, the money will go into the organizations that allowed us to perform in their venues and into the merchandising we provide for both the cast/crew and the supporters that do fund us(posters, tshirts, etc.)</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>WIPP was built by the theatre kids</strong> that never got the chance to show their truest potential on stage or behind the curtain, we have always allowed the kids that join our group to express themselves in ways they never could through a theatrical experience that allows them both to better themselves in what they love to do and to have a fun and memorable experience in the presence of people they can both look up to and call on as close friends. We have become more of a family-based organization over the years and we plan on staying that way.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For theatrically interested kids from ages 14+</strong> there aren't many ways to be this expressive in theatrical arts.<strong> I mean, what theatre group allows you to write your own show?!</strong>
</li>
<li>This is a fun, lovable, talented group of people that only look to improve themselves even more each year.</li>
<li>
<strong>If allowed to expand throughout the Island</strong>(or even further than that perhaps, in years to come) we would have such an impact on kids who don't have a strong support group of friends, have an undiscovered talent, and want to make a difference in their community but don't know how to be heard. WIPP does that for our kids.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the last ten years, WIPP has become a family filled with traditions and support from all who associate with us.</strong> We have had a very strong impact on those involved with us and left those who have come to see us with something they will always remember. Our only goal is to continue our ongoing success. But we need your help to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>LOOP Theatre endeavours to make the arts open and accessible to those with learning disabilities and to invest in their contribution to the wider artistic community.</p>
<p class=""whiteText"">We are a mixed ability company from Glasgow who create inspirational theatre together.</p>
<p>We run free workshops for people with learning disabilities that give them opportunities to collaborate with practicing professional artists.</p>
<p class=""whiteText"">Our syllabus is informed by physical theatre practice which is, in essence, open and accessible to all. Our skill set is rich and diverse, informed by our collective years of experience in a range of art forms including contemporary dance, theatre, physical practice, music, acro-balance, aerial skills, butoh and visual art.</p>
<p class=""whiteText"">Our Theatre is discovered and created through collective collaboration and a passionate, joyful process.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>The £1,000 we are hoping to raise will allow us to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Cover our start up fees to formally register as a Community Interest Company - which will mean we are able to apply for project based funding.</li>
<li>Acquire materials and resources to offer more diverse stimuli to participants e.g. advanced tactile resources for participants with sensory impairment</li>
<li>Hire space to run our workshops far more regularly than just once a month. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The knowledge that you are supporting and advancing a unique service that encourages and empowers creativity in an often overlooked and undervalued community. </li>
<li>
<p>By way of thanks we will give you a custom LOOP gift or an invaluable LOOP Theatre experience!</p>
</li>
<li>In the event that we do not reach our goal, the money raised will go a long way to ensuring that we can register as a company and continue to provide free, high quality workshops. </li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>LOOP Theatre is excited by the opportunity to provide our participants with a platform to express themselves, have fun and be professionally trained in physical theatre. As well as building confidence and self-esteem, we provide a unique opportunity for people to come and play without judgement, to learn about themselves and each other towards positive personal growth by means of the performance making process.</p>
<p>Over the last year LOOP Theatre has enabled participants to attend free workshops that run every 4th Saturday, Summer School projects and create devised performances.</p>
<p>Our Summer School Show involved 20 participants, 4 support staff and 10 artists. Over the space of a week we explored spacial awareness, movement and performance skills allowing the participants to develop their own material in a safe and encouraging environment giving them ownership and pride in both the process and the final performance. </p>
<p>""I didn't know what to expect. I was genuinely impressed with the progress you made in a week. I could tell that the participants really loved it and had gained confidence. We look forward to doing it all again.""</p>
<p>Eleanor, Riddrie Learning Centre</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The training and experience that LOOP offer is hugely rewarding for both the participants and the tutors. We are proud to be able to provide such a creative, people centred project that is invaluable to the community and with your help we can continue to reach out to even more people that may not otherwise have opportunities like this.</p>
<p>Our tutors have been working in this area for a number of years and have found that using physical theatre, visual art and music is an extremely effective vehicle for enabling self expression in everyone.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In 1996, the Greater Rochester Repertory Companies (GRRC) was founded to provide an environment for actors, musicians, and all theatre practitioners to teach and learn. Along with that mission, we vowed to give a voice and venue to local and regional authors.</p>
<p>For 17 years we have produced original works by many aspiring playwrights. The most recent of these is ""The Life of Leo Wool,"" a play by Rochester native Nina Alvarez.</p>
<p>Some of you may know Nina, some may not. For the uninitiated, her play's staged reading for the 2012 Fringe Festival received an excellent reception and enthusiastic audience feedback.</p>
<p>""The Life of Leo Wool"" leaves people talking, debating, and exploring their judgments, desires, and personal relationships. Some responses have been:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>“Leo Wool addresses the timeless truths of the written word's relationship to the human condition, made genuinely interesting and broadly accessible by Ms. Alvarez."" -Jeremy Sniatecki</span><br/><br/><span>“The author, Nina Alvarez, a most talented, Virgilian tour guide, shines light upon the dark memories consigned to the corners of its closets. She empties out the repressed contents of its locked cabinets. And, finally, she exhumes, with reverence, the faded remains of a love, long hidden beneath carefully forgotten floorboards. If, within your own house, you have ever struggled, even for a moment, to find the balance point between HONESTY and COMPASSION, this tour (de force) is one you ought to take!” - Michael Haugh</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span> </span></p>
<p>""The Life of Leo Wool"" will be directed by Chair of the SUNY Brockport Theatre Department, P Gibson Ralph, and will feature the well-known local talents of Jack Simel, Diane Chevron, Jessica Drew-Cates, Jason Alexander Holmes, as well as a  debut performance by Nancy Berg.</p>

Entertain and Restore Organization (HERO) is committed to opening the Webster
City Movie Theater once again.  The
closing of small-town theaters is rumored to be not so uncommon in the
industry.  With the advent of Redbox and
Netflix, going out to the movies is perceived to be declining in
popularity.  Yet … yet, there is still a
vibrant market that wants to go to the movies. 
It’s more than just seeing a movie. 
It’s going out to dinner first, then to the movies, then for a
drink.  It’s taking the family to the
movies and enjoying the popcorn and having the conversation with your kids
after the movie – a special treat for everyone.  Going out to a movie will always be a staple
of entertainment for the American public.

			the Klingon Language).""</i><br/><br/>Written by Christopher Kidder-Mostrom and Sasha Walloch, <i>A Klingon Christmas Carol</i> was first performed in Saint Paul, MN in 2007.  This year (2013) marks the 8th time that Commedia Beauregard has produced the play (4 times in MN, 4 times in Chicago... 2010 had shows in both cities).  <br/><br/>In every production prior to this year, the show has looked basically the same.  The show was done on a bare stage with a table, 4 chairs, and a coat rack.  The costumes were reminiscent of ancient warriors from Earth's middle ages and before... with a hint of Klingon flair.  <br/><br/>The goal this year is to make the show unlike it has ever been before:  A new multi-level set, new costumes that blend Victorian England with Klingon aesthetics (think steam-punk-Klingon), a new much smaller venue that creates an up-close intimate experience, new fights, new sound-scape... everything is being redone from the ground up.<br/><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">The Need</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<li>Costumes = $2,500 --  We have an awesome Costume designer named kClare Kemock.  She designed our costumes for ""Bard Fiction"" which combined Jacobian England and 1990's Movie style in each outfit.  Now she's doing a similar thing with mashing-up Victorian era clothing with a sense of Klingon style!</li>
<li>Sets = $1,000 --  Set designer Ian Mostrom is building a multi-level set with a gritty space-used feel.  We'll be able to climb and leap and create new worlds unlike ever before.  And it'll feel a bit like Firefly meets 11th Doctor TARDIS meets Andromeda meets Mad Max!  Awesome!</li>
<li>Wigs &amp; Prosthetic Foreheads = $750 -- A completely new cast (including a new Scrooge!) means new forehead appliances and the wigs that go along with them. </li>
</ul>
<p>This campaign is only for the major parts of the production that are being overhauled.  Most of our expenses are covered by ticket sales (Please buy tickets!).  We are not asking for money to pay for actor stipends, designer stipends, venue rent, rehearsal space, new weapons, publicity and advertising, tech staff, printing, lighting equipment, sound and music, etc.<br/></p>

</h3>Commedia Beauregard is a small professional theatre company that recently became a resident company of the West Stage of the Raven Theatre Complex in Chicago, Illinois.<br/><br/>We have been around since 1999 (starting in Minneapolis/Saint Paul) and have put up 30 productions over the last 14 years.  Since 2011 we have been HQ'd in Chicago.<br/><br/>Here's our mission statement:<br/>""<em>Our mission is to translate the universal human   			experience 
to the stage: to expand our horizons and share knowledge   			of all 
cultures, translating between languages and between arts to   			create 
theater that is beautiful in expression.</em>""<br/><br/>What does that mean?  Well, normally we do plays that are translated from foreign languages into English.  Sometimes we experiment with what it means to translate, and we end up with a play based on a painting, or a ballet based on an essay.  And then, once a year, we do a play that is translated into <i>tlhIngan Hol </i>(the Klingon language). <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we are a small theatre company.  Really small.  The press that this play gets every year can make it look like we're a ridiculously successful group.  And in one way we are: we get to create wonderful theatre and awesome projects that people seem to enjoy when they attend.  That being said, while we are committed to paying the artists, actors, and designers with whom we work, we're not making money at this.  So we need your help.<br/></p>
<p>Including this year's cast, over 90 people have learned to act in Klingon through this production since 2007.  It's safe to say it is unlike any other production they've been in.  It is demanding and challenging, and makes lifelong friends out of the people who have gone through the process.</p>
<p>And it does special things to the audience, too.  Our goal is to affect people, and while it may seem like a play that is essentially a parody has little chance to change the world, we aim to do just that.  The people who come to see this show get a live theatrical experience that cannot be replicated.  There are audience members who come back year after year.  We're now part of a holiday tradition for some families.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>We'd like to be a tradition to more people than ever before, and we're hoping that with your help we can bring a new vision of this play to new people as well as returning audience members.<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","The Play

			the Klingon Language).""Written by Christopher Kidder-Mostrom and Sasha Walloch, A Klingon Christmas Carol was first performed in Saint Paul, MN in 2007.  This year (2013) marks the 8th time that Commedia Beauregard has produced the play (4 times in MN, 4 times in Chicago... 2010 had shows in both cities).  In every production prior to this year, the show has looked basically the same.  The show was done on a bare stage with a table, 4 chairs, and a coat rack.  The costumes were reminiscent of ancient warriors from Earth's middle ages and before... with a hint of Klingon flair.  The goal this year is to make the show unlike it has ever been before:  A new multi-level set, new costumes that blend Victorian England with Klingon aesthetics (think steam-punk-Klingon), a new much smaller venue that creates an up-close intimate experience, new fights, new sound-scape... everything is being redone from the ground up.The Need

Because we're reinventing the whole production from the ground up, we're adding things like a set!  We've never had a set before!  And we're creating completely reimagined costumes.  New heads and wigs are on the table, too!  Let's break it down numbers-wise:
Costumes = $2,500 --  We have an awesome Costume designer named kClare Kemock.  She designed our costumes for ""Bard Fiction"" which combined Jacobian England and 1990's Movie style in each outfit.  Now she's doing a similar thing with mashing-up Victorian era clothing with a sense of Klingon style!
Sets = $1,000 --  Set designer Ian Mostrom is building a multi-level set with a gritty space-used feel.  We'll be able to climb and leap and create new worlds unlike ever before.  And it'll feel a bit like Firefly meets 11th Doctor TARDIS meets Andromeda meets Mad Max!  Awesome!
Wigs & Prosthetic Foreheads = $750 -- A completely new cast (including a new Scrooge!) means new forehead appliances and the wigs that go along with them. 

This campaign is only for the major parts of the production that are being overhauled.  Most of our expenses are covered by ticket sales (Please buy tickets!).  We are not asking for money to pay for actor stipends, designer stipends, venue rent, rehearsal space, new weapons, publicity and advertising, tech staff, printing, lighting equipment, sound and music, etc.
The Company
Commedia Beauregard is a small professional theatre company that recently became a resident company of the West Stage of the Raven Theatre Complex in Chicago, Illinois.We have been around since 1999 (starting in Minneapolis/Saint Paul) and have put up 30 productions over the last 14 years.  Since 2011 we have been HQ'd in Chicago.Here's our mission statement:""Our mission is to translate the universal human   			experience 
to the stage: to expand our horizons and share knowledge   			of all 
cultures, translating between languages and between arts to   			create 
theater that is beautiful in expression.""What does that mean?  Well, normally we do plays that are translated from foreign languages into English.  Sometimes we experiment with what it means to translate, and we end up with a play based on a painting, or a ballet based on an essay.  And then, once a year, we do a play that is translated into tlhIngan Hol (the Klingon language). 



The Impact
As mentioned above, we are a small theatre company.  Really small.  The press that this play gets every year can make it look like we're a ridiculously successful group.  And in one way we are: we get to create wonderful theatre and awesome projects that people seem to enjoy when they attend.  That being said, while we are committed to paying the artists, actors, and designers with whom we work, we're not making money at this.  So we need your help.
Including this year's cast, over 90 people have learned to act in Klingon through this production since 2007.  It's safe to say it is unlike any other production they've been in.  It is demanding and challenging, and makes lifelong friends out of the people who have gone through the process.
And it does special things to the audience, too.  Our goal is to affect people, and while it may seem like a play that is essentially a parody has little chance to change the world, we aim to do just that.  The people who come to see this show get a live theatrical experience that cannot be replicated.  There are audience members who come back year after year.  We're now part of a holiday tradition for some families.

We'd like to be a tradition to more people than ever before, and we're hoping that with your help we can bring a new vision of this play to new people as well as returning audience members.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>SFAMFW is the creative child of <strong>Stuart McMeans</strong>, whose comedy songs are frequently performed by Broadway performers in NYC and around the US.

<h3>
<font size=""4"">This Is What Happened</font><br/>
</h3>
<p>Movement Continuum is a contemporary dance company that was founded at a Thanksgiving dinner party in one of our tiny, apartment living rooms.  Five of us had gotten together for a potluck-styled evening, and during the aftermath of full bellies we were all laying around and began talking about what we always talk about: dance.  If we didn't know each other beforehand because of dance, we all met in college because of it.  It's our common ground.  It's the reason we all keep moving.  And, if we have a free second, we dream about it.  That night in November was a night for dreaming.  Thoughts were thrown around, we laughed a lot, said ""what if?"" about 3,000 times, and then, it happened.  All of a sudden we decided it was going to be real.  We were going to start our own professional dance company.  It was like that moment when Wendy learns she can fly in Peter Pan.  She finally just lifts off, and before she knows it, she's second star to the right and straight on till morning.  That same night we began planning our premiere performance.      <br/></p>
<br/><font size=""4""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flaming Youth</span></font><br/><br/>Our premiere performance, Flaming Youth, is a full length dance 
production based completely in the 1920's.  Why the 1920's?  Because 
we're obsessed with the fashion.  We're in love with the finger waved 
hair and the blood red lips.  But, mainly, we picked the 1920's because 
it's a time period rife with similarities to our own, now in the 21st 
century.  We're all interested in what our roles and positions are, as women, in the society and culture America has put in front of us.  Are we liberated?  What does that question mean?  We are women and we all have the opportunities to go to work, school, drink in public, vote, and buy our own homes.  But, we also look at magazines every day that tell us we need a smaller waist, higher heels, Botox, longer lashes, thicker hair, smoother skin, thinner legs, and bigger breasts.  We're told that even if you are going to save the world by spear-heading a campaign to save the wolves in Alaska, we should probably still look sexy while doing it.  And we see, that even if you're a brilliant woman running for any political office or trying to run a company, you're still going to be sexually harassed and the media will probably pay more attention to your cup size then your stock holdings or poll popularity.  These all sound like the things women have been creating a dialogue about for years, but maybe that's the whole point.  If we're still talking about them, then something hasn't changed.  There is still work to be done.  <br/><br/>None of these concerns are so different from the 1920's.  Women believed to be liberated.  No more corsets, no more whale-boned dresses with high necks, but with that change came binding breasts and hips to achieve the stylistically popular boy-shaped figure.  What we want to show are the parallels between then and now.  Where have we come from as women?  Where are we going?  And, what stops did we make on the way?  These are some the questions we have translated into movement.  We hope our performance will not only be entertaining, but will also be thought-provoking and perhaps create a dialogue within our own community of how we all can work together to build an avenue for change.<br/>       <br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><font size=""4"">The Impact</font></p>
</div><div>
<br/>So, what's going to happen if we don't get to put on this performance?  You know, the trees aren't going to split down the middle and there aren't going to be sudden appearances of crop circles,  But, what will happen is this: a community that desperately needs a stronger, physically visual, artistic presence will not have that opportunity for continued growth.  A dance company that could have made an important, positive impact on the young girls of this community, won't make it through it's first season.  There's nothing tragic about that.  But, there is something just a wee bit tragic anytime an artistic voice is silenced.  Anytime someone is forced to hold their breath and not tell their story, well, things like that just shouldn't happen.  We feel like the reason we are here, on this earth, is to create.  We want to share everything we create in the hopes that it will spur a dialogue.  It will propel change.  The impact of this show <span style=""font-style: italic;"">could</span> be a tiny drop in the ocean, but we don't believe that for a second.  In fact, we've never believed in anything more.  Our voice isn't going to be silenced.          <br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font size=""4"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</font></h3>
<p>The long and short of the matter is that we mainly need money to pay our balance for our venue rental, but we also need it to pay for costumes, prop building and incidentals like having posters printed to promote our show.    Every penny we make from this page will go directly to funding the things listed above.  The $1,000 we are asking for will give us the breathing room we desperately need. It is unbelievably expensive to clothe eight dancers for a full length performance, let alone hire out the help we need to have our props built.     <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We'll give you free tickets, signed posters, signed DVD's, you want to come hang out backstage and see what really happens?  We'll get you that, too.  We just want to share, share, share what we love and hope that you love it all as much as we do.  It's hard building from the ground up, and we need all the support we can get.   <br/></p>

Movement Continuum is a contemporary dance company that was founded at a Thanksgiving dinner party in one of our tiny, apartment living rooms.  Five of us had gotten together for a potluck-styled evening, and during the aftermath of full bellies we were all laying around and began talking about what we always talk about: dance.  If we didn't know each other beforehand because of dance, we all met in college because of it.  It's our common ground.  It's the reason we all keep moving.  And, if we have a free second, we dream about it.  That night in November was a night for dreaming.  Thoughts were thrown around, we laughed a lot, said ""what if?"" about 3,000 times, and then, it happened.  All of a sudden we decided it was going to be real.  We were going to start our own professional dance company.  It was like that moment when Wendy learns she can fly in Peter Pan.  She finally just lifts off, and before she knows it, she's second star to the right and straight on till morning.  That same night we began planning our premiere performance.      
Flaming YouthOur premiere performance, Flaming Youth, is a full length dance 
production based completely in the 1920's.  Why the 1920's?  Because 
we're obsessed with the fashion.  We're in love with the finger waved 
hair and the blood red lips.  But, mainly, we picked the 1920's because 
it's a time period rife with similarities to our own, now in the 21st 
century.  We're all interested in what our roles and positions are, as women, in the society and culture America has put in front of us.  Are we liberated?  What does that question mean?  We are women and we all have the opportunities to go to work, school, drink in public, vote, and buy our own homes.  But, we also look at magazines every day that tell us we need a smaller waist, higher heels, Botox, longer lashes, thicker hair, smoother skin, thinner legs, and bigger breasts.  We're told that even if you are going to save the world by spear-heading a campaign to save the wolves in Alaska, we should probably still look sexy while doing it.  And we see, that even if you're a brilliant woman running for any political office or trying to run a company, you're still going to be sexually harassed and the media will probably pay more attention to your cup size then your stock holdings or poll popularity.  These all sound like the things women have been creating a dialogue about for years, but maybe that's the whole point.  If we're still talking about them, then something hasn't changed.  There is still work to be done.  None of these concerns are so different from the 1920's.  Women believed to be liberated.  No more corsets, no more whale-boned dresses with high necks, but with that change came binding breasts and hips to achieve the stylistically popular boy-shaped figure.  What we want to show are the parallels between then and now.  Where have we come from as women?  Where are we going?  And, what stops did we make on the way?  These are some the questions we have translated into movement.  We hope our performance will not only be entertaining, but will also be thought-provoking and perhaps create a dialogue within our own community of how we all can work together to build an avenue for change.       The Impact

So, what's going to happen if we don't get to put on this performance?  You know, the trees aren't going to split down the middle and there aren't going to be sudden appearances of crop circles,  But, what will happen is this: a community that desperately needs a stronger, physically visual, artistic presence will not have that opportunity for continued growth.  A dance company that could have made an important, positive impact on the young girls of this community, won't make it through it's first season.  There's nothing tragic about that.  But, there is something just a wee bit tragic anytime an artistic voice is silenced.  Anytime someone is forced to hold their breath and not tell their story, well, things like that just shouldn't happen.  We feel like the reason we are here, on this earth, is to create.  We want to share everything we create in the hopes that it will spur a dialogue.  It will propel change.  The impact of this show could be a tiny drop in the ocean, but we don't believe that for a second.  In fact, we've never believed in anything more.  Our voice isn't going to be silenced.          

What We Need & What You Get
The long and short of the matter is that we mainly need money to pay our balance for our venue rental, but we also need it to pay for costumes, prop building and incidentals like having posters printed to promote our show.    Every penny we make from this page will go directly to funding the things listed above.  The $1,000 we are asking for will give us the breathing room we desperately need. It is unbelievably expensive to clothe eight dancers for a full length performance, let alone hire out the help we need to have our props built.     

We'll give you free tickets, signed posters, signed DVD's, you want to come hang out backstage and see what really happens?  We'll get you that, too.  We just want to share, share, share what we love and hope that you love it all as much as we do.  It's hard building from the ground up, and we need all the support we can get.   

Other Ways You Can Help!

Movement Continnum is hosting a fundraising event October 12th at Al's Bar, located at 6th & North Limestone in Lexington, Kentucky.  There will be poetry readings by the magnetic Bianca Spriggs and charismatic Eric Sutherland, music by musical genius, Warren Byrom, belly dancing performances by Rakadu and Mecca Dance Company, and Red Lotus Henna will be there in all her beautiful glory to do henna.  We'll also be showing our promotional trailer for Flaming Youth, filmed by the uber-talented Landon Antonetti.  It's going to be a fabulous night!  Things kick off at 7:30 p.m.  Be there and support the local artistic community! We're taking a suggested donation of $5 at the door, and you know we'll have to pass around the hat like we're at church, too.  Check out our website:  www.kentuckymovement.com

attorney whose impact is still being felt in courtrooms and in our society today.
The play examines his life, his impact on our judicial system and his quest to
tackle issues of social justice. This evening of living history provides the
audience with an opportunity to examine the growth of our nation and to
contrast the social issues from our past as they relate to our present day
struggles as a society. In addition to performing Clarence Darrow on campuses

<p>Hi. I'm Pandora Scooter. I'm a spoken word artist, which means I write and perform exciting, electric poetry for my audiences.  I founded a company called standUP &amp; standOUT productions, dedicated to providing inspiring, life-changing, and entertaining programming for LGBTQ youth.  I've been dedicated to the LGBTQ youth community/audience for 10 years now and this is my second solo show written specifically for them.</p>
<p>The show is called I AM ENOUGH and it is about suicide prevention and self-confidence building.  It follows the story of Pan and her struggles with rejection from family and friends for being different and being gay.  After a few suicide attempts, and the help of a fabulous counselor, Pan gets clear that she wants to live, thrive and that she is enough.</p>
<p>I AM ENOUGH opens the door for conversations about this very sensitive and critical topic.  It provides permission to talk about suicidal ideation and by talking about it, we can lessen the number of youth who attempt suicide.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We will be touring to LGBTQ Community Centers with very limited budgets.  To offset the cost of the tour, we need to raise funds to pay for gas, food, lodging, personnel, tolls, rental vehicle and scholarships for the Centers that can't afford to pay for the show.  All told, the I AM ENOUGH tour will cost $19,100.</p>
<p>Here's how it breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuel (7000 miles of travel)...........$1500</li>
<li>Food.....$4200 (when we can't get meals from venues)</li>
<li>Lodging...$3500 (when we can't crash at someone's house)</li>
<li>Boxes/Tape....$400 (props for the show)</li>
<li>Scholarships.....$5000 (to cover the expense of the show for Centers that can't afford the show)</li>
<li>Tour/Merch Manager....$4500</li> </ul>
<div>In exchange for your generous donation, there are a wide variety of perks including House Concerts, Personalized Poems, Skype Sessions with Pandora and I AM ENOUGH swag.</div>
<div>If we don't raise all the money...well...we're still going on tour.  We'll have to tighten our belts a lot and possibly skip some of the Centers that can't afford the show.  If we fail miserably with the fundraising, then I'm going to use the money to film the show and post it on YouTube for LGBTQ youth to see across the US.</div>
<div>But let's not think that way!  If we can get 400 people to donate $50, we've got the goal covered!  And if you are considering giving (thank you!) then I bet you'd be willing to encourage some friends to give, too.</div>
<div>We're going to make this tour happen.  It has to!  Because:</div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>You can help make sure that there is:</p>
<p>One less LGBTQ youth suicide in the US.</p>
<p>And ten less suicide attempts, as well.</p>
<p>That's the minimum impact of the I AM ENOUGH tour.  The maximum?  Hundreds fewer suicide attempts and hundreds more conversations about suicide instead of attempts.  And maybe we keep 10, 20 or more LGBTQ youth alive.</p>
<p>The show has been endorsed by a child psychologist as well as another therapist who deals with LGBTQ clients and GSA Advisors.  And LGBTQ youth have endorsed it as well.</p>
<p>My last show OUTwordlyFabulous, which I took on tour in the southern states was a critical and popular success with the LGBTQ youth and Advisors I performed for.  The tour also broke even, with the help of sponsors and donors, like you.</p>

</div><div> <p>Raising almost $20K for a relatively obscure, but potent, problem like LGBTQ youth suicide isn't easy.  Our society isn't very conversant when it comes to suicide.  And people are always worried, ""Well, if you talk about it, won't you encourage it?""  </p>
<p>Well, my 30+ years dealing my suicidal thoughts/tendencies/attempts (my own and many others) has taught me a lot.  One: Talking about suicide NEVER leads to suicide.  Two: NOT talking about suicide leads to suicide attempts.  Three:  Spotting someone who is unstable is pretty simple.  Four:  I am not a professional, and I always refer youth who confide in me to professionals in their resource Centers.</p>
<p>I AM ENOUGH is a responsible, inspiring and informative show about suicide prevention.  It is not going to give anyone the idea to kill themselves.  It is going to do the opposite.  It is going to give LGBTQ youth hope and a positive way to think about themselves.</p>
<p>So, overcoming these challenges will be difficult.  But I believe I can make the issue plain for people who are willing to listen.</p>

<p>ABOUT THIS PRODUCTION OF HAMLET: This production was inspired by issues raised by the He For She campaign and the desire to make the characters and issues of the show gender universal (after all, there is female protagonist of a Shakespearian tragedy, and yet the themes and issues of Hamlet relate just as much to women. Likewise Ophelia's issues can very much resonate with men.) It's set ever so slightly in the future in a highly militarized society where Hamlet is a woman who has been raised as a man for succession purposes. Horatio is the highest ranking woman in the military, Ophelia is a slightly effeminate, sensitive (in contrast to the militarized society) man, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are the ""Queen Bees"" of Wittenberg, and Horatio is the only high ranking woman in the military (all the other roles are ""gender appropriate."")</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>However, in order to get started we need your help. We are looking to raise $6000 dollars to put this wonderful production on. We are dedicated to paying our wonderful team of performers and technicians and if we surpass our goal , we have been given the opportunity to, not only transfer this show to a theatre in New Jersey, but to take it across the Atlantic to a fringe theatre in the UK.</p>
<p>We thank you for any assistance, and in return, we will grant you some special perks.  </p>

No matter what side of the issue you are on, labor is currently both losing and gaining ground.  Let's take a deeper look together. Thank you for your support!</p>

<p>Charlie is a
socialist who was born in 1980, the year Ronald Reagan was elected president of
the United States. In Charlie’s words, “1980 was the Left’s equivalent of the
Mayan calendar’s 2012.” It is the worst imaginable period in recent western
history to identify as a socialist, a three-decade span in which neo-liberal
orthodoxy and global capital have become dominant ideological and political
forces across the world.  If it’s true that over the last 30 years the wealthiest 1% have accumulated more wealth than in any other time in history, why does it feel
impossible for us to imagine anything else? And he’s going to make us laugh.
Yep. Likely a lot. That’s <i>Leftovers</i>,

We're asking those we believe share our values and our desire to challenge the systems we don’t believe to stand together with us and help make <i>Leftovers </i>happen. We are asking our community to join Neworld Theatre in commissioning it. Shows can’t get made if people like Charlie don’t have time to write them. Dissent can’t be expressed if communities aren’t willing to stand up and invest in what they believe. We believe that our culture -- what we choose to say together – is more valuable and more meaningful than the things we are told over and over again by the mass media. We think that’s important.

<p>Ale House began in 2012 as a small company testing the limits of our actors and audience with full and uncut productions of Shakespeare. Since then we have produced three successful productions as well as a free public reading of Shakespeare's lost play, <b><i>Edmund Ironside</i></b>. As we move into our largest production ever, we remain confident in our belief that Shakespeare has more to offer the 21st century than we can imagine. The key lies in the skill of the actor and an absolute faith in Toronto's theatre-going audience. To foster this relationship our productions are inspired by the theatre practices of Shakespeare's own day: a time when a small group of actors used language and movement to  captivate thousands of rowdy patrons every single day.</p>

<p>Connolly &amp; Co. is an emerging dance
company led by Lauren Connolly, a choreographer and dance educator from New
Jersey. We are invested in how dance can initiate physical, intellectual,
emotional and spatial transformations. Based on a vocabulary of athleticism and
an exploration of the virtuosic human body, we aim to embrace the unknown
territory of humanity and social behaviors while creating work that is
engaging and accessible to all audiences. </p>
<p>We are launching our campaign because
we need your help in supporting all of the artists and collaborators involved
in our current and upcoming projects. Laying the foundation for a new dance
company can be strenuous and financially taxing because of the cost of the
artistic and production elements. </p>

</div></div>","Connolly & Co. 





Connolly & Co. is an emerging dance
company led by Lauren Connolly, a choreographer and dance educator from New
Jersey. We are invested in how dance can initiate physical, intellectual,
emotional and spatial transformations. Based on a vocabulary of athleticism and
an exploration of the virtuosic human body, we aim to embrace the unknown
territory of humanity and social behaviors while creating work that is
engaging and accessible to all audiences. 
We are launching our campaign because
we need your help in supporting all of the artists and collaborators involved
in our current and upcoming projects. Laying the foundation for a new dance
company can be strenuous and financially taxing because of the cost of the
artistic and production elements. 


What We Need 

This
past Spring we were chosen to participate in Jersey (New) Moves! at NJPAC and
The Koresh Dance Company Come Together Dance Festival in Philadelphia.  
10 Dancers. 2 Major Projects. 1
Year of Upcoming Projects 
Your contribution
and participation will provide us with the resources to succeed. Your funds will produce high caliber works, provide original costumes, cover travel expenses,
submission fees, overnight accommodations, and build a future for upcoming
projects. Most importantly, it will compensate the dancers and collaborators for their time, labor and
artistry. 
The majority of the contributions
made to our campaign will go to the dancers and collaborators for their endless
devotion, patience and dedication. It is rewarding to work with dancers who
embrace the unknown and have trust in the overall journey of the work.  


The Impact
With your donation, you will not only impact a community of people, but you will have a hand in the mission to redefine dance.

This has been a
big year for Connolly & Co. We are excited and honored to be part of Jersey
(New) Moves! at NJPAC and the Koresh Come Together Dance Festival at the
Suzanne Roberts Theatre in Philadelphia. We want to continue making work that
bridges audiences and different communities together and we need your financial
contributions and support to turn that into a reality.  



Taking a Risk and Other Ways You Can Help
 
Making art is a risk. As artists, we
take those risks because we ultimately believe in the power of movement. 
Any contribution will make the
biggest difference! If you cannot donate, you can still help us by reaching new
audiences:

<p>When Russia sent their dog Laika into the atmosphere, it probably cost them millions of dollars. To send our metaphorical dog (good theater) into metaphorical space (Fitchburg), we’re only asking for $1,000. We are a collection of three artistic individuals who are hoping to bring a fresh take on theater into our area. How fresh? Bel-Air fresh. We want every show to be something special. We don’t want to give too much away, but just imagine with me for a second...you walk into see a show and suddenly, there's live music, social media integrations, and a fun atmosphere. You’ll find it all and more at Theater On Tap. Most importantly, it is our mission to inspire the community by providing artistic entertainment and opportunities. We will strive to challenge as well as engage artists and audiences alike with a take on theater that is financially accessible and welcoming to all.</p>

<div>As you can probably imagine, starting a theater company from scratch is hard to do. But we've set the foundation and now we're nearing the finish line! The money we receive will not only go towards our start-up, but also to our future. Once we get started, it will be constant work to keep going. This isn't a a one time thing, it is our goal to keep Theater On Tap running beyond this first season. That will require owning our own venue, paying actors and directors, but we don't wish to bore you with the abundance of things that will have to be taken care of. Instead, know that every penny that we don't use during this start-up period will go towards the challenges that lie ahead. If you're interested in the future of this company, here is a brief look at our overall vision:</div>

<h3>Meet The Team</h3>
<p>Theater On Tap was founded and is being run by young professionals who have already had much experience with theater.</p>
<p>Noah Dawson is not only a co-founder of Theater On Tap, but he also serves as the Artistic Director. He's a simple guy, one who enjoys the finer things in life, like Vanilla Chai. Noah just graduated from Fitchburg State University, receiving a BS in Communications Media with a concentration in Theatre. He acts (just completed a tour with the longest continually running children's theatre tour), directs (he's in production for <i>The Odd Couple </i>at a local college right now), and writes (he once won a competition in Playwrighting class). This guy's got it. Whatever ""it"" is.</p>
<p>Mary Darling is a co-founder of Theater On Tap and serves as Managing Director. She likes to be called chief around the office. Mary is finishing up her last semester of college with a killer internship in Boston. She will soon be graduating with a BS in Communications Media with concentrations in Theatre and Professional Communication from Fitchburg State University. Aside from acting and directing, she is an aspiring playwright. Maybe one day, you'll pick up one of her plays at the library, judge it by it's cover, and put it back in the wrong spot. </p>
<p>Matt Lewis is not a co-founder of Theater On Tap, but he is the Company Manager. He has an Associates in both Theatre and Business from Northern Essex Community College and is now furthering his education at Fitchburg State University. He's done everything there is to do when it comes to theater, but prefers to work tech over acting. This is why we keep him around. In order to fund his lavish lifestyle, Matt has taken to many different jobs. A dish washer. A baker. What hasn't he done? We don't know. He truly is a jack of all trades. </p>
<p>There you have it. We need not say more. These guys have plenty of experience with theater and are surely qualified for the job of running a company on their own. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Aries In Flight’s choreography evokes the styles of past Theater Jazz icons and merges them with a contemporary flair. The dance company aims to legitimize Theater Jazz as a valuable player in the concert dance world and educate both our audiences and the dance community in this historically rich tradition, delighting them with show-stopping repertoire. Our long-term vision is to strengthen future generations of Theater Jazz dancers through dance classes, educational programming in historical knowledge, performance opportunities, and collaborations within the dance community.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which I intend to carry out this mission is by performing in showcases throughout the NYC metropolitan area. Aries In Flight will be performing our signature piece along with a new work at the upcoming Artists In Flight Performance Showcase this fall. This performance will require rehearsal fees, dancer fees, and costume costs. Today I am reaching out to ask you to consider making a donation to this project. With your support we will be able to fully participate in this performance opportunity and bring our mission further into the dance community. We are at a pivotal stage in this project and your contribution is essential to our success at this time. The performance will take place on November 12 at West Park Presbyterian on the upper west side of Manhattan. There will be 2 performances, a 4pm show and a 7pm show. This showcase will be covered by Broadway World reviewers and dance industry professionals who will enable Aries In Flight to reach a broader audience. All monies raised will be used to pay the $300 in rehearsal rental space, $800 in dancer stipends/expenses, and $100 in costume costs . We will not be able to participate in this prestigious NYC showcase without YOUR help. Our fundraising deadline is Friday November 18, 2016.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our total costs for participating in this performance is $1200. Here is how the expenses are being broken down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rehearsal Costs: $300</strong>. This equates to  20 hours of rehearsal space. </li>
<li>
<strong>Dancer Fees:</strong><strong> $800</strong>. This will cover a large percentage of the fees we are paying our dancers for their performance at the show. We have some funding already set aside for this, however we still have a little ways to go. Your contribution will help a dancer get paid for the cultural contribution they are making to NYC community.</li>
<li>
<strong>Costume Costs: $100</strong>. This will cover the costs of costuming 11 dancers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are unable to reach our funding goal the monies will be used to cover as many of these expenses as possible.</p>
<p>As a thank you for your generous contributions we will gift you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$20 <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">USD</span> Collegiate Star</strong>: For all contributions of $20 or less you will receive a Thank You Shout Out on our social media platforms.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The success of this campaign will enable Aries In Flight to bring the legacy of theater jazz to a wider audience. Since our last fundraising campaign last year we have been selected to perform at 5 different venues and have grown our social media following by 20%. Additionally our company has begun to offer workshops to aid dancers in creating long and sustainable dance careers. Aries In Flight is emerging as leader in the dance industry and your support will enable us to continue to grow and share our mission.</p>

Aries In Flight’s choreography evokes the styles of past Theater Jazz icons and merges them with a contemporary flair. The dance company aims to legitimize Theater Jazz as a valuable player in the concert dance world and educate both our audiences and the dance community in this historically rich tradition, delighting them with show-stopping repertoire. Our long-term vision is to strengthen future generations of Theater Jazz dancers through dance classes, educational programming in historical knowledge, performance opportunities, and collaborations within the dance community.
One of the ways in which I intend to carry out this mission is by performing in showcases throughout the NYC metropolitan area. Aries In Flight will be performing our signature piece along with a new work at the upcoming Artists In Flight Performance Showcase this fall. This performance will require rehearsal fees, dancer fees, and costume costs. Today I am reaching out to ask you to consider making a donation to this project. With your support we will be able to fully participate in this performance opportunity and bring our mission further into the dance community. We are at a pivotal stage in this project and your contribution is essential to our success at this time. The performance will take place on November 12 at West Park Presbyterian on the upper west side of Manhattan. There will be 2 performances, a 4pm show and a 7pm show. This showcase will be covered by Broadway World reviewers and dance industry professionals who will enable Aries In Flight to reach a broader audience. All monies raised will be used to pay the $300 in rehearsal rental space, $800 in dancer stipends/expenses, and $100 in costume costs . We will not be able to participate in this prestigious NYC showcase without YOUR help. Our fundraising deadline is Friday November 18, 2016.

What We Need & What You Get
Our total costs for participating in this performance is $1200. Here is how the expenses are being broken down:


Rehearsal Costs: $300. This equates to  20 hours of rehearsal space. 

Dancer Fees: $800. This will cover a large percentage of the fees we are paying our dancers for their performance at the show. We have some funding already set aside for this, however we still have a little ways to go. Your contribution will help a dancer get paid for the cultural contribution they are making to NYC community.

Costume Costs: $100. This will cover the costs of costuming 11 dancers.

If we are unable to reach our funding goal the monies will be used to cover as many of these expenses as possible.
As a thank you for your generous contributions we will gift you:


$20 USD Collegiate Star: For all contributions of $20 or less you will receive a Thank You Shout Out on our social media platforms.

$25 USD Off Broadway Star: For all contributions of $25-$49.99 you will receive an autographed company photo and a Thank You Shout Out on our social media platforms.
$50 USD Broadway Star: For all contributions between $50-$99.99, you will receive a DVD of our November 12 performance, a video shout out on our social media platforms and all the perks in the lower levels. (Amount over $2.00 is tax-deductible.)
$100 USD All-Star: For all contributions of $100-$199.99 you will receive all of the lower level perks and an Aries In Flight T-Shirt. (Amount over $10 is tax-deductible.)
$200 USD Super Star: For all contributions of $200 or more you will a shout out thank you on our social media sites, a DVD of the performance, 1 ticket to the November 12 show (you may choose either 4pm or 7pm show), and a 1-Hour Meet and Greet/Performance with the company. Catherine will contact you privately to arrange a date. (Amount over $59 is tax deductible.)


The Impact
The success of this campaign will enable Aries In Flight to bring the legacy of theater jazz to a wider audience. Since our last fundraising campaign last year we have been selected to perform at 5 different venues and have grown our social media following by 20%. Additionally our company has begun to offer workshops to aid dancers in creating long and sustainable dance careers. Aries In Flight is emerging as leader in the dance industry and your support will enable us to continue to grow and share our mission.

   What We Need 
The performers are coming from both the US and France, so we're asking just enough to cover plane tickets and transportation funds. If anything is left over, it will go towards hostels, props, and costumes. 
   
The Show 


With beautiful Spanish Golden Age text, sex, wit, and artistry, we invite the audience on Segismundo’s journey of questioning what is real versus dreaming, what is honor versus complacency, what is man versus woman, what is love versus imagination, and how none of these are perhaps opposites at all. 
The tale is of Segismundo, a prisoner who wakes up one morning to find that he has been crowned king, to arise the next morning in jail, only to later become king again, as he was a prince the whole time. 

Why Paris?
Life Is A Dream Tour has been performed in two locations with completely different objectives, performers, environments, and dreams. The production we are working on for Paris would be special to Paris and Paris alone. We are currently working with Paris-based performers and US-based performers, will work with any site that you give us. 

 With Paris at heart, Life Is A Dream Paris is a Surrealist performance piece.  A theatrical mindfuck, Life Is A Dream Paris is a macabre question of whether or not you are awake.

</div></div>","The legendary playwright Noël Coward wrote Home Chat in 1927 when it was first performed. Its groundbreaking portrayal of a woman unconstrained by conservative societal norms went down sourly with the original audience, nearly relegating the play to obscurity for almost nine decades.
The playtext was discovered last year by our director, Martin Parr, who obtained the rights from the Noël Coward estate to stage the play, and the Finborough Theatre offered its space for the revival to take place.
Now, we are turning to the public to help mount this momentous revival. All donations will go towards the costs of staging a professional theatrical production including physical costs, marketing and venue hire. In addition, through a deal with publishers, the playscript will be available to the public, and Home Chat will be appreciated for the masterpiece it is.

   


Following a disastrous train crash in Paris, during which Janet Ebony and her best friend Peter Chelsworth are sharing a sleeping compartment, scandalous outrage ensues as Janet's husband Paul and her fearsome mother-in-law accuse them of adultery and public indiscretion.
Matters are made worse when Janet's equally fearsome mother and Peter's fiancée, Lavinia Hardy, enter the maelstrom. Confusion, accusation and outrage are the order of the day as Janet and Peter, aghast at their families disapproval, plot to invent an adulterous affair, to test the limits of their warring kin.
As the play reaches its climax, everybody’s world is turned on its head as, after a series of devilish twists, the true deceivers are revealed and Janet steps into a new and surprising future...
 In order to break even for a play of this size, with a theatre the size of the Finborough Theatre, we must raise at least £18,000 in grants and donations before ticket sales. As of June, we have raised upwards of £8,000 of that figure in personal gifts and donations. The remainder is down to people like you.
All the money raised will go towards costs of mounting the production (set, costume, lighting equipment). We aim to pay everyone a living wage for the weeks worked, and everyone involved is extremely dedicated and committed to the project. 
In return, we'd love for more people to be involved in the production process through regular updates from the production team and the cast. We can also offer tickets, as well as exclusive tickets to the press night, normally closed to anyone not in the industry. Finally, we can also offer the opportunity to watch the dress rehearsal, giving you the opportunity to not only see the show before anyone else, but also to see how the workings of a professional theatre company function!

<p><i>Enveloped in Velvet </i>is an in-house piece of new writing from

two showings of the work at <b><a href=""http://homemcr.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HomeMCR</a></b>, both of which were followed with a Q&amp;A

<p><b>WHY IS THE SHOW RELEVANT?</b></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In all of human history, there has never been so
many people on the earth and we have never been able to connect with each other
so easily. As technologies progress, we
are becoming ever more connected in the way that we can communicate.</p>
<p>Despite this, people's ability to empathise with one another is beginning to falter. And this is no surprise. The way we interact is changing; we have fewer face-to-face conversations with our friends. We have to work harder <span style=""background-color: initial;"">to engage emotionally, working against </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">apathy,</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">distraction and selfishness. Ironically, although we are better connected, we
are increasingly socially isolated.</span></p>
<p>We feel that the best way to explore the issues in this play is by
creating an intimate show outside of a 'theatre' where people are invited to be
together in the same physical environment and engage in their own
self-examination.</p>

THE PLAY


Enveloped in Velvet explores the way in which people communicate, feel and empathise; tackling the peculiarly modern struggle between how we are socially conditioned to feel and how we actually feel.

Four people find themselves stranded in the shallow waters of modern
existence. Facing up to the self-deception and triviality of their everyday
encounters, each challenge themselves to speak honestly about the things we
think but don't say. As the four monologues veer in different directions, they

</div></div>","Your generous support will help Schweinehund become a full-length theatre piece.


Schweinehund is a puppetry and animation piece created and directed by me, Andy Gaukel.


Inspired by the life of Pierre Seel— who was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned by the Nazis in 1941 on suspicion of being gay— Schweinehund is a meditation on Seel’s real-life tragedy during this dark time.


Funds generated by the generous Indiegogo community will be used to help fund the final phase of Schweinehund's development. This phase includes rehearsing the piece and preparing it to be premiered in front of a live audience with the aim of touring Schweinehund to theatres, schools, universities and festivals around the world. 


Your donation will: 


Pay for a rehearsal/workshop space this summer in Louisville, KY.


Help compensate my dedicated team of talented performers and artists involved.


Pay for a video projector for projecting Schweinehund’s animations.

Pay for the sound equipment.

Pay for the lighting equipment needed to light the puppetry.
Pay for media materials such as posters, photos and advertising to help further promote Schweinehund.


Any funds received past our goal will go towards bringing Schweinehund to a wider audience.


Schweinehund History, Techniques and Hopes:


Initially developed as a ten-minute workshop performance for the 2011 Xperimental Puppetry Theater Program at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, GA, myself and my team are now focused on developing Schweinehund into a full-length puppet theater production that will premiere in 2014. 


To tell this delicate story, I have decided to use Bunraku inspired puppet manipulation combined with projected hand-drawn animations to create an integrated choreographed movement piece set to music.


To create the animation in Schweinehund, I am collaborating with Michael Collin, an artist based in Glasgow, Scotland. Michael's animations create the perfect juxtaposition to the bleak world and devastating story the puppetry tells.


What started as a pursuit to bring one man’s tragic story to life, has evolved into a gripping and deeply personal meditation on the depths of cruelty and the resilience of the human spirit.


My team and I hope to share this amazing and touching story in hope that it will increase understanding and create a dialogue among the generations of today that will positively impact the future.

Biggest Challenge:

It's no secret, the biggest challenge in producing live theatre is financing. Even with my team of incredible artists, all the talent in the world won't provide the necessary equipment and means needed to fulfill our vision.


Without you, this kind of theatre cannot exist. 


Thank you so much for your support,


Andy Gaukel

<h3>Why do we need your help?</h3>
<p>LivelyWood Pictures, producers of the show in association with South Hill Park Arts Centre, needs your help to be able to get this production to the Edinburgh Fringe. Taking a show to the Fringe can be an expensive, but invaluable task. We would like your help to cover some of the costs involved in taking a show to the Fringe. In return you will receive the benefits detailed in the appropriate 'Perk'. With your help, this production can be seen by thousands of people, and potentially possible to be on tour in 2014, celebrating Charlie Chaplin's Centenary year since bursting onto our screens in 1914 - This is an important target for us to achieve, and your help will edge us closer to achieving this.</p>
<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>Spencer Franks, a young actor played by Clive Elkington, has been given the chance to step into the hat, the cane and the moustache of his idol, as well as those not so little tramp shoes. In the moments before he goes on stage, whilst running through his lines, he talks himself through the highs and lows of Charlie Chaplin’s life, emanating pure inspiration from the film legend as he aspires to recreate his success. Spencer draws on the enthusiasm and influence of Chaplin a hundred years ago, through the trials and tribulations that still pushed him further through his career no matter what, making him a world famous film star before the end of World War I. Mixing live theatre and multimedia, with a great big toothy grin and the inspiration of a legend behind him, Spencer takes the audience through it all. With Chaplin’s centenary year in sight since bursting onto our screens, this production, approved by the Charlie Chaplin estate based in France, is a visual and visceral story of two men’s ingenuity.</p>
<h3>The History</h3>
<p>Back in April 2011, this whole process began. Initially, finding a pre-existing one man show about was difficult, so we went on the hunt for a writer. When we came across JeTamme Derouet, immediately we were throwing ideas together about what we wanted in the show and JeTamme's sheer knowledge and expertise on Chaplin was superior - we knew she was right for the job. An original show was performed in October 2012 under the title 'The Man, The Myth, The Legend'. It has since gone on to be adapted by David Wembridge and the new version of the show, 'The Hat, The Cane, The Moustache' will preview at South Hill Park, Bracknell in July, before heading to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August.</p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>We have set our target to £1800, which is actually only a small fraction of the cost involved with taking a show to The Fringe. This amount will mostly help us to pay for accomodation so that we don't have to sleep in the workhouse for 5 weeks.</p>
<p>All donations, including any we receive beyond our target will be gratefully received and will help to cover other costs, for example: travel, living costs, administration, set, printing.</p>
<h3>The best bit, what do you get in return? Well...</h3>
<p>£10 - You will receive a flyer for the Edinburgh production, signed by the cast.... Well, Clive. (It's a one man show), as well as updates about the production on it's road to The Fringe, whilst at The Fringe, and after The Fringe if it goes on tour in 2014. (Please supply email address for the updates).</p>
<p>£25 - You will get your name in the programme as a supporter of the show, as well as a signed flyer and updates about the show (email required).</p>
<p>£50 - You will be IN the show. A photo of you will dress the set alongside other donaters of this level. As well as a signed flyer, updates about the show (email required) and your name in the programme.</p>
<p>£100 - You will receive your own personal copy of the script, signed by Clive. As well as a signed flyer, updates about the show (email required), name in the programme and photo of you in the show.</p>
<p>£500 - You will receive Legend status, lots of major thanks and a bottle of champagne. Ok, seriously. If you donate this, you will be noted as a sponsor of the show, and if you have a company or similar, we will place your logo on the programme and links to your website will be posted on our social media pages. You will also receive a complimentary ticket to see the show either at South Hill Park (19-20 July) or Edinburgh (1-26 Aug). As well as, a signed flyer, updates about the show (email required), name in the programme, personal signed copy of the script and photo of you in the show.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every penny will help here and will be gratefully received.</p>
<p>We would like the opportunity to celebrate the centenary year of Chaplin next year, and by doing Edinburgh Fringe Festival helps that target of being a little closer than before. You will be making it possible by donating, and we could not be more thankful for it.</p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Why do we need your help?
LivelyWood Pictures, producers of the show in association with South Hill Park Arts Centre, needs your help to be able to get this production to the Edinburgh Fringe. Taking a show to the Fringe can be an expensive, but invaluable task. We would like your help to cover some of the costs involved in taking a show to the Fringe. In return you will receive the benefits detailed in the appropriate 'Perk'. With your help, this production can be seen by thousands of people, and potentially possible to be on tour in 2014, celebrating Charlie Chaplin's Centenary year since bursting onto our screens in 1914 - This is an important target for us to achieve, and your help will edge us closer to achieving this.
The Show
Spencer Franks, a young actor played by Clive Elkington, has been given the chance to step into the hat, the cane and the moustache of his idol, as well as those not so little tramp shoes. In the moments before he goes on stage, whilst running through his lines, he talks himself through the highs and lows of Charlie Chaplin’s life, emanating pure inspiration from the film legend as he aspires to recreate his success. Spencer draws on the enthusiasm and influence of Chaplin a hundred years ago, through the trials and tribulations that still pushed him further through his career no matter what, making him a world famous film star before the end of World War I. Mixing live theatre and multimedia, with a great big toothy grin and the inspiration of a legend behind him, Spencer takes the audience through it all. With Chaplin’s centenary year in sight since bursting onto our screens, this production, approved by the Charlie Chaplin estate based in France, is a visual and visceral story of two men’s ingenuity.
The History
Back in April 2011, this whole process began. Initially, finding a pre-existing one man show about was difficult, so we went on the hunt for a writer. When we came across JeTamme Derouet, immediately we were throwing ideas together about what we wanted in the show and JeTamme's sheer knowledge and expertise on Chaplin was superior - we knew she was right for the job. An original show was performed in October 2012 under the title 'The Man, The Myth, The Legend'. It has since gone on to be adapted by David Wembridge and the new version of the show, 'The Hat, The Cane, The Moustache' will preview at South Hill Park, Bracknell in July, before heading to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August.
What We Need and What You Get
We have set our target to £1800, which is actually only a small fraction of the cost involved with taking a show to The Fringe. This amount will mostly help us to pay for accomodation so that we don't have to sleep in the workhouse for 5 weeks.
All donations, including any we receive beyond our target will be gratefully received and will help to cover other costs, for example: travel, living costs, administration, set, printing.
The best bit, what do you get in return? Well...
£10 - You will receive a flyer for the Edinburgh production, signed by the cast.... Well, Clive. (It's a one man show), as well as updates about the production on it's road to The Fringe, whilst at The Fringe, and after The Fringe if it goes on tour in 2014. (Please supply email address for the updates).
£25 - You will get your name in the programme as a supporter of the show, as well as a signed flyer and updates about the show (email required).
£50 - You will be IN the show. A photo of you will dress the set alongside other donaters of this level. As well as a signed flyer, updates about the show (email required) and your name in the programme.
£100 - You will receive your own personal copy of the script, signed by Clive. As well as a signed flyer, updates about the show (email required), name in the programme and photo of you in the show.
£500 - You will receive Legend status, lots of major thanks and a bottle of champagne. Ok, seriously. If you donate this, you will be noted as a sponsor of the show, and if you have a company or similar, we will place your logo on the programme and links to your website will be posted on our social media pages. You will also receive a complimentary ticket to see the show either at South Hill Park (19-20 July) or Edinburgh (1-26 Aug). As well as, a signed flyer, updates about the show (email required), name in the programme, personal signed copy of the script and photo of you in the show.


The Impact
Every penny will help here and will be gratefully received.
We would like the opportunity to celebrate the centenary year of Chaplin next year, and by doing Edinburgh Fringe Festival helps that target of being a little closer than before. You will be making it possible by donating, and we could not be more thankful for it.

<h2><strong>THIS IS ENDTIMES</strong></h2>
<p>EndTimes is an independent Theater/Film Production Company founded in New York City in 2006.<strong> </strong>Since then, EndTimes has produced 10 Full-Length Productions, and over 100 short plays, involving the talents of more than 300 theater artists. The company has performed in the New York, San Francisco, and Edinburgh Fringe Festivals, winning top honors for Best Production, Best Director, and Best Ensemble at the San Francisco Fringe Festival in 2008 for William Whitehursts Knuckleball, and again in 2009 for Mark Borkowskis The Godling. EndTimes also won the Best Production award in 2010 for its presentation of Jamie King's TMZTV at the Shortened Attention Span Festival. EndTimes has been widely featured in various publications, including, Time Out New York, The New York Times, The Huffington Post, The San Francisco Chronicle, The New York Post, The Daily News, and Broadwayworld.com.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>EndTimes focuses on work that is dark and satiric, with an underlying element of social commentary. Incorporating dance, music, vaudeville, and comedy, we produce high-energy, entertaining theater that is aimed at a wider audience than more traditional forms. Drawing for inspiration from sources as varied as the Marx Brothers, Alice Cooper, Robert Anton Wilson, Del Close, the Annoyance, and George Romero, EndTimes merges popular forms with the ancient tradition of live performance to create a theater experience that is appealing and accessible to modern audiences.</p>

<h2><strong>WHERE WE'RE GOING</strong></h2>
<p>EndTimes has been truly blessed over the past year, garnering critical acclaim, and finding an amazing new home at The 133<sup>rd</sup> Street Arts Center.  Starting with an empty building one year ago, EndTimes has gradually renovated the space, offering rehearsal and performance opportunities to local artists, for a fraction of the price of downtown facilities.  As a result, the formerly empty space, is now alive with activity around the clock, and its black box theater books out 6 months in advance.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Bunker Graphic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://endtimesproductions.org/files/IndieGogo_2012/ET_Bunker_Text.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Artistically, EndTimes also raised the bar this year, moving Naked Holidays from its downtown home (RIP Ace of Clubs), to its first Off-Broadway level production, at The Times Square Arts Center, selling out most of the run to a primarily out-of-town audience.  Its been a long, strange, wild trip for a troupe that faced financial collapse not so very long ago.  But to keep moving onward and upward, we need a little help from our friends.</p>

<p>Our new home needs a lot of work.  To really become the fully functioning arts facility that it could be, we need to replace floors and ceilings, hire a contractor to fix the terminally leaky roof, lay down sound proofing between our two active floors, and even run heat to our rehearsal studio, which we’re currently forced to close down for the winter.  Its an old building, that’s been neglected for a long time.  To really make it come alive again is going to take funds.  By contributing those funds, you aren't only helping one company, you're helping to provide a much needed low-cost facility to the entire New York arts community.</p>

If you can help out with a contribution, that's amazing. We'll show our amazement and gratitude with a personal thank you, and one of the nifty gifts to the right.
And even if you cant contribute, please spread the word via Facebook, Twitter, Text, Likes, Retweets, and foggy Instagram pictures. Shout your barbaric yawp over the rooftops of Brooklyn.  Let people know the campaign is happening. Tell as many people as you can about EndTimes Productions efforts to put together the best season ever.

Thanks to everyone who has supported EndTimes over the years, and continues to make our work possible. 
We have provided a creative home for hundreds of theater artists during the past five seasons, and will continue to create a space where artists can try out the craziest thing they've ever thought of doing, in an environment that fully supports that choice.",13.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW? </b><br/></p>
<p>Over the past year, we've been developing something we call <b>Prime Plays: </b>High quality evenings of theatre that can be produced with little-to-no materials. In fact, all you need are: <br/></p>
<p>-An audience</p>
<p>-Actors</p>
<p>-Digital tablets from which to read</p>
<p>These plays have life-and-death stakes as well as fantastical atmospheres but it's all boiled down to crackling dialogue. Audiences have loved the Prime Plays because of the storytelling. We love Prime Plays because they offer <b>a new, easier way to put on live theatre. </b><br/></p>

That's right: The campaign is still taking tax-deductible contributions 
until January 2 and if by then we can crack $3k, I will take my boxes 
and be recorded doing a Pioneer Square “victory lap” in your honor. For every $100 raised after the $3k, I will do an additional lap inside the square.
Everyone is welcome to contribute up through Friday, January 2nd. And of course, everyone is welcome to witness the victory laps at noon in the square on Monday, January 5th
And now... the company story:

WHO ARE WE? 
The Pulp Stage theatre company offers live theatre to fans of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Suspense. We've been operating out of Portland, Oregon for the last five years and are delighted to have recently been awarded status as a non-profit organization. *Please see an important note about tax deductions at the bottom of our story.

WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW? 
Over the past year, we've been developing something we call Prime Plays: High quality evenings of theatre that can be produced with little-to-no materials. In fact, all you need are: 
-An audience
-Actors
-Digital tablets from which to read
These plays have life-and-death stakes as well as fantastical atmospheres but it's all boiled down to crackling dialogue. Audiences have loved the Prime Plays because of the storytelling. We love Prime Plays because they offer a new, easier way to put on live theatre. 


Actors, tablets and audience! This is one of 17 different Prime Play showcases we'vebrought to venues ranging from bars, to living rooms to back yards! Performers (from the left) Kaia Maarja Hillier, Matt Haynes and Donna Kay Yarborough. Photo by Daniel Smith.WHAT'S OUR PROJECT? 
In January of 2015, we're going to premiere BOX, a Prime Play by Tina Connolly and Matt Haynes. BOX is a science fiction series that will be shown in three weekly installments. 

Sometime in the future... 
Jane, a high school student, has been arrested under suspicion of a heinous crime. In a government detention center, Jane is wired into a virtual reality program that sends her through a series of flashbacks and fantasy games... all with the intent of exposing her crime and reprocessing her mind.

WHY YOU’RE IN GOOD HANDS
The Prime Play project is not just some theory. Over the last year and a half since the project started: 
-We have received over 240 submissions from around the country.
-We’ve showcased 34 plays, 3 of which are world premiere adaptations from renowned science fiction stories.
-We’ve worked with over 30 different actors in 17 showcases put on in 8 different venues throughout Portland, from bars to private residences.
-We have also collected over 160 anonymous surveys that our audiences fill out after each show. We have frequently gotten top numbers when asking how the audience would rate the show as“Exciting.” Other write-in descriptions: “Gripping”, “delightful”, “eye-opening”, “cool”, “fun”, “intense”, “cutting edge” and “FABULOUS”!
Both in the office and on the stage, we've been hard at work developing this unique form of theatre. We're ready take the next leap with your support.

<b>STORY</b><br/><br/>Transformational Personal Theatre, LLC is a collaborative expressive arts company based in Eugene, Oregon. We give voice to those who are stereotyped and marginalized in our culture, while promoting personal growth, development, and healing from trauma. Performers tell their life stories using creative, multi-media expressive arts forms, including spoken word, live original music, as well as recorded music, poetry, visual arts, dance, movement, stand-up, and video projections.<br/><br/>The current show in development is focused on addiction recovery. The title of the show is, NOT HERE: From Howling Hurt to Healing Hope, the Alchemy of Addiction Recovery. The title is based on a poem called ""Not Here,"" by sixteenth century mystic poet Rumi, that speaks to the need to walk through fire in order to transform.<br/><br/>The intention of the project is to facilitate positive transformations in each individual's recovery process that can also be sustainable once the show is over. A secondary goal is to raise awareness about the magnificence and worth of every human being, no matter what challenges are present that overshadow personal gifts and authentic essence.</div><div>
<br/>With a diverse cast of ten women and men, the show is a deeply rich portrayal of personal triumph over pain and suffering. The performers, most of whom have never had any sort of theater experience, are truly gifted and amazing individuals who exhibit sheer courageousness in daring to tell their personal stories.<br/><b><br/></b>

<b>IMPACT STATEMENT</b><br/>The impact of this project 
will benefit the performers and audience alike. The project provides a healthy outlet for 
creative expression. This form of performance art can reignite life

place of living one’s authentic self, new hope for healthy and 
sustainable growth and change is generated.<br/>

<div>
<br/>Audience members will be moved profoundly in bearing witness to the immense
 bravery, heart-felt messages, and multidimensional symbolic portrayals 
of real life. This witnessing acts as a catalyst for catharsis of the 
performers, and has the potential to do the same for audience members, as they recognize their own similar experiences. In this way, 
performers and audience members act as sacred mirrors, one for the

<div>
<br/>Ultimately, acceptance and unconditional positive 
regard for oneself and others is the core objective underlying the 
development of this performance. From a place of compassion and love, hope for healing

<b>WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO DONATION IF PERFORMANCE DOES NOT HAPPEN</b><br/>Regardless of whether the performance happens, remaining expenses will be donated to White Bird's Chrysalis Behavioral Health Services, which is the non-profit we are working in conjunction with. Those funds will be earmarked specifically to help support those in treatment for substance abuse issues.<br/><b><br/>WAYS TO PREVENT PROJECT FROM NOT REACHING ITS GOAL OF PRESENTING A SHOW</b><br/>The performers in this show are enacting their own life 
stories, and therefore there is a risk 
that the performers could change their minds at any time about the

 rehearsal, and between rehearsals, to help the performers with their goal of making it to the stage.<br/><br/>Each performer has the opportunity to become a 
client of Chrysalis Behavioral Health Services, in order to receive counseling support during the development of the show, and for two to four months after the show is over, at no cost. This will help the performers sustain any positive 
transformations in their recovery processes they were able to achieve as
 a result of participation in the show.<br/><br/>The facilitator also 
makes every effort to recruit additional performers if someone opts out

<h3><b>Who Are We?</b></h3>
<p>We are Any Other Name Company and our focus is providing a platform for marginalized voices to tell their stories through the lens of classical theatre. </p>
<p>Which is our fancy way of saying that, last fall, a couple of idealistic college friends, a little drunk on ice cream and chicken wings, disheartened at the lack of representation in our chosen field, turned to each other and said: “We should just start our own company.”  </p>
<p>However, don’t let that fool you; we are actually qualified to do so. </p>
<p>Aside from our BFAs in Classical Acting, we have each worked at professional theaters across the country directing, performing, managing, educating, marketing, supervising, and producing a variety of projects from Shakespeare to modern classics.</p>
<h3>Why All Women?</h3>
<p>As we discussed piece selection – the day after our ice cream and chicken bender, at a conference focused on bringing advocacy to women in the arts – we were feeling so optimistic at the grand ideas of we could achieve. After two days of conferencing with other attendees, we were feeling pretty confident about our talents, abilities, and future. </p>
<p>Then, that afternoon, Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed, and suddenly, every woman in the room with us visibly diminished. All of us knew what it felt like to be the woman who wasn’t believed. </p>
<p>However, being women, we dusted ourselves off and got on with it. To paraphrase many wise people: In every disaster lies opportunity.  Our idea for a theatre company suddenly had a clear direction for our first production: An all-female <i>Measure for Measure</i>.</p>
<h3>“Who Will Believe Thee…?”</h3>
<p>In the second act there is a scene where the heroine, Isabella, is being coerced by Angelo, a powerful city official, into giving up her virginity to save her brother’s life. When she threatens to expose him his response is, “Who will believe thee, Isabel?” Although written 400 years ago, this still hits home for too many people today. </p>
<p>Simply put, this <i>is</i> a woman’s story, and we believe women need to tell it.</p>
<h3>This Part is Numbers, But There are Cookies at the End</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $4,000. This amount will help us pay for a venue for auditions, rehearsals, and two weeks of performances. It will also provide a budget for set design, costumes, sound, and lighting. </p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, we want to pay our artists! </p>
<p>With an acting cast of at least eight, and various designers and technicians, we want to ensure everyone is compensated fairly for their time and effort.</p>
<p>Obviously, we don’t expect something for nothing, so we have a lot of great perks for you! They include everything from discounts on tickets to homemade cookies to a stellar thank you gift when all is said and done.</p>
<h3>What’s The Point?</h3>
<p>So what are we <i>really</i> trying to do? </p>
<p>We want to provide a side of a narrative that often goes unheard. We are hoping that anyone of any gender or identity who sees themselves in Isabella’s story feels less alone and more empowered. For those who don’t relate to Isabella, all we hope is that this story will help them consider what side of this power equation they are on, and how they can help balance it in the future. </p>
<p>Eventually, we plan for this company to grow into a space for people whose stories and viewpoints are often overlooked in film, television, on stage, and in the national conversation as a whole. A place for anyone regardless of race, gender, ability, or orientation  can create both a mirror and a window where their community can see themselves represented and where others can see their point of view. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you’re saying to yourself “This sounds incredible, and I really want to help, but I have no money.” Thank you, you sound incredible too! And guess what: We would still love you to be involved in any way you can. If you’re in the Chicago area, or are just incredibly enthusiastic, email us to volunteer your time and abilities. </p>
<p>If you’re not in Chicago, or are and just don’t want to lift heavy things, feel free to share our campaign on social media(s) and let other people know about our work here.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Duke Raulston is our producer and he had this wonderful idea to utilize the beautiful, Princess Theatre in South Pittsburg, Tennessee, in a horror hosting venture. He contacted me, Hope Holloway, to act and direct. Together we put gathered an amazing group of actors, writers, videographers, photographers, and other crew. We plan on having our live performances at The Princess (which will include variety show aspects, theatre and then the showing of the classic horror movie) filming webisodes, and doing character appearances, etc. We have well developed, quirky characters all ready to go. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To really get started for our first live show, we need $2,000. There is the deposit on the theatre, the fee for renting the theatre, the fee for licsening the movie and some advertising fees. That is just the bare bones of what we need for the first show. If we are able to raise more than that, we will be able to do more thorough advertising, spend some on costuming and start with the needed equipment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you spend:</p>
<p>Up to $25--Our ""undying"" grattitude.</p>
<p>$25--A sticker of one of our characters</p>
<p>$50--A Dark Princess Theatre t-shirt</p>
<p>$1,000--4 tickets and a Dark Princess Theatre t-shirt</p>
<p>$2,000--1 year membership (admission for one person to any and all live shows for 1 year) and a Dark Princess Theatre t-shirt</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We plan on changing the way people look at horror hosting, with a strong female horror host that defies the stereotypes. Our approach will be unique in many ways. We will be introducing dance, music, sword fighting and many other types of unusual aspects. </p>
<p>By bringing this exciting new venture to South Pittsburgh, Tennessee--Duke's hometown--we hope to shine the light on both the town itself and also the lovely, renovated Victorian theatre, The Princess. South Pittsburg is conveniently located, about 30 minutes outside of Chattanooga and with easy access to Nashville and Huntsville. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help<span style=""font-size: 10px;""><br/></span>

<p>If you can't contribute financially, we would still be very appreciative of your help. If you could just share our campaign for us that would help out tremendously! You can use the Indiegogo share buttons--easy peasy! Thank you so much! </p>

<p><span><strong>Who &amp; What</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I am Danielle Selby, the director of SelbyDance.  Since graduating college with my degree in dance my friends and I have been getting together every summer to continue to make dance even though we have been scattered over several states.</span></p>
<p><span>Last summer to help lessen the financial burden we launched a mini dance intensive. This summer our sights are set even higher. We will be creating our first concert series.  This is a large creative and financial undertaking and my dancers and I can not take on this financial burden on our own.</span></p>
<p><span>Our concert series will include the completion of Menagerie of the Uneven Minds, a 40 minute piece about Fear.  Already partially created this work is inspired by H.P. Lovecraft and the horror genre. Delving into our deepest darkest places we exploit the fears, passions, obsessions and hatred found there. This dance will be the centerpiece of our summer concert series.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>How</strong></span></p>
<p><span>How can you help make this project a reality? What we are asking for will not cover all of our expenses.  The list below includes bringing dancers to Lansing, Michigan to rehearse and perform.  It also includes travel to and housing in Stowe, Vermont in order to perform.</span></p>

By supporting this project you will be supporting the arts, the creation of new original works, and a concert series which will bring these dances to a wide and diverse audience.

<p><strong>Iain Stringer Works presents, in association with theSpaceUK Prevail: a dramatic tale told through music and dance at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2018</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>What's Prevail about?</strong></i></p>
<p>An oppressive way of life dominates. Two men are alone. Intimate. They are ambushed by a gang. There’s a struggle. One escapes. The other is humiliated and the event filmed and shared on social media. He attempts to fight back. The gang take him away and report untruths to the authorities about him. He faces a trial and is imprisoned by a judge. Punished by an interrogator.... Though both are separated, they fight for the right to be reunited and for the truth.</p>
<p><i><strong>What's the background to Prevail?</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>Prevail</strong></i> is a narrative dance work. Iain Stringer began writing the plot and composing the music for full orchestra in 2010. In 2015 he won a Wandsworth Council arts grant to workshop <i><strong>Prevail</strong></i> at the Putney Arts Theatre, London. In 2017 the work was part of an Arts Council England/Lottery Funded programme for St. Helens Council’s Arts In Libraries/Cultural Hubs initiative. <i><strong>Prevail </strong></i>dancers then and presently are:</p>

<p>Short Summary</p>
<p>Kidz Theater needs your help to provide scholarships for our 2019 season!  We are currently dealing with the skyrocketing costs of production in New York City--while we are looking to raise $15,000--a fraction of the cost of the scholarships we give out per season.  </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Our goal is $15,000 for this season.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Kidz Theater needs your help to provide scholarships for our 2019 season!  We are currently dealing with the skyrocketing costs of production in New York City--while we are looking to raise $15,000--a fraction of the cost of the scholarships we give out per season.  
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is $15,000 for this season. We provide well over $40,000 in tutition assistance yearly, and as such, this money would be instrumental in providing rehearsal space, renting the theater, props, costumes, set, as well as making sure we can keep mainstage participation for our mentor performers COMPLETELY FREE!

Her mother adored the balada singers. They were glamorous and feminine. Feminine in a way that felt untouchable and dangerous to a queer little kid in 1980’s Puerto Rico. khattie’s mother died at the age of 49. The loss was sudden and world-shattering. As the years passed, khattie began to embody the character Catalina La O. Playing Catalina gave khattie the opportunity to express the feminine that seemed untouchable as a child. It also created an invisible link between khattie and her mom.</p><p>Through sight gags and clowning, confession and cabaret <i>Catalina La O </i>is ultimately a piece about survival. How do we survive trauma? How do we rebuild after a natural disaster? What do we become when we allow ourselves to flourish?</p><p><strong>Why now? </strong></p><p><i>Catalina La O presenta: Ahora Conmigo </i>is a piece for the queer and POC communit(ies). It is a piece for the colonized body. It is a piece for women. It is a piece for Puerto Ricans. It is a piece for the non-gender binary. It is a piece for anyone who has experienced heartbreak. It is a piece for mothers. It is a piece for daughters. It is a piece for survivors. It is a piece for those who have been left to fight alone in the middle of a storm. It is a piece that speaks to resistance<i>. </i></p><p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p><p>We are khattieQ (musician/performer) and Jenny Larson (writer/director) and we create collaboratively devised queer performance.</p><p>Hailing from Puerto Rico, khattieQ has played as a professional musician with over twenty bands including touring with queer femme core band The TunaHelpers. Jenny is an interdisciplinary theatre artist who formerly served as the AD of Salvage Vanguard Theater in Austin, TX.</p><p>Our piece <i>Catalina La O presenta: Ahora Conmigo </i>is the recipient of the 2020 Fringe New Play Prize from Playwright Theatre Centre and Vancouver Fringe Festival. This fall <i>Catalina La O</i> will receive a test production and we are raising funds to help pay the artists who are working with us on this project.</p><p><strong>When is the performance?</strong></p><p>We will present the film of the performance in October of 2020 as part of the Vancouver Fringe Festival.</p><p>We will premiere the performance as a live experience in the 2021-2022 theatrical season, as an associate production of the internationally acclaimed Neworld Theatre.</p><p><strong>What do we need? </strong></p><p>We are raising $6500 to cover the minimum expenses associated with paying our team for their work in September<i>. </i></p><p>We have an incredible group of talented individuals gathered to bring <i>Catalina La O </i>to life. Everything we raise from this campaign will go directly to them. You can read a brief bio about our creative team at the end of our campaign details!</p><p><strong>What if we don't meet our goal?</strong></p><p>If we don’t raise the full $6500 we are still committed to honoring our minimum commitment to each artist.</p><p><strong>What if we exceed it?</strong></p><p>If we raise more than we are asking for, we will be able to pay each artist a larger honorarium. At present, their minimum honorariums are not enough. We need to pay everyone more. Thank you for helping us make that happen.</p><p><strong>What are the perks?</strong></p><p>We have the best perks y'all!</p><p>Including a digital download of the original music from the show by khattieQ and composer Anton Berríos, a<i> Catalina La O </i>sticker, and a karaoke party with khattieQ.</p><p><strong>What if the show can't go on?</strong></p><p>The show will go on!</p><p>We’ve moved early stages of development to digital formats in response to the current pandemic, and find this piece uniquely adaptable in its explorations on themes of isolation and survival.</p><p>The audience discovers Catalina sheltering in place alone after a catastrophic storm. She performs for the camera, desperate to reach her audience, and her mother, through the lens.</p><p><strong>How else can I help?</strong></p><p>Please help us spread the word!</p><p>Share our campaign on the Faceplace and the Tweeter.</p><p>And follow us on Instagram (@khattie and @_jennylars_) for all things JKJK.</p><p><strong>Who is team <i>Catalina La O</i>?</strong></p><p>khattieQ (creator) is a musician and performer from Puerto Rico.

Her mother adored the balada singers. They were glamorous and feminine. Feminine in a way that felt untouchable and dangerous to a queer little kid in 1980’s Puerto Rico. khattie’s mother died at the age of 49. The loss was sudden and world-shattering. As the years passed, khattie began to embody the character Catalina La O. Playing Catalina gave khattie the opportunity to express the feminine that seemed untouchable as a child. It also created an invisible link between khattie and her mom.Through sight gags and clowning, confession and cabaret Catalina La O is ultimately a piece about survival. How do we survive trauma? How do we rebuild after a natural disaster? What do we become when we allow ourselves to flourish?Why now? Catalina La O presenta: Ahora Conmigo is a piece for the queer and POC communit(ies). It is a piece for the colonized body. It is a piece for women. It is a piece for Puerto Ricans. It is a piece for the non-gender binary. It is a piece for anyone who has experienced heartbreak. It is a piece for mothers. It is a piece for daughters. It is a piece for survivors. It is a piece for those who have been left to fight alone in the middle of a storm. It is a piece that speaks to resistance. Who are we?We are khattieQ (musician/performer) and Jenny Larson (writer/director) and we create collaboratively devised queer performance.Hailing from Puerto Rico, khattieQ has played as a professional musician with over twenty bands including touring with queer femme core band The TunaHelpers. Jenny is an interdisciplinary theatre artist who formerly served as the AD of Salvage Vanguard Theater in Austin, TX.Our piece Catalina La O presenta: Ahora Conmigo is the recipient of the 2020 Fringe New Play Prize from Playwright Theatre Centre and Vancouver Fringe Festival. This fall Catalina La O will receive a test production and we are raising funds to help pay the artists who are working with us on this project.When is the performance?We will present the film of the performance in October of 2020 as part of the Vancouver Fringe Festival.We will premiere the performance as a live experience in the 2021-2022 theatrical season, as an associate production of the internationally acclaimed Neworld Theatre.What do we need? We are raising $6500 to cover the minimum expenses associated with paying our team for their work in September. We have an incredible group of talented individuals gathered to bring Catalina La O to life. Everything we raise from this campaign will go directly to them. You can read a brief bio about our creative team at the end of our campaign details!What if we don't meet our goal?If we don’t raise the full $6500 we are still committed to honoring our minimum commitment to each artist.What if we exceed it?If we raise more than we are asking for, we will be able to pay each artist a larger honorarium. At present, their minimum honorariums are not enough. We need to pay everyone more. Thank you for helping us make that happen.What are the perks?We have the best perks y'all!Including a digital download of the original music from the show by khattieQ and composer Anton Berríos, a Catalina La O sticker, and a karaoke party with khattieQ.What if the show can't go on?The show will go on!We’ve moved early stages of development to digital formats in response to the current pandemic, and find this piece uniquely adaptable in its explorations on themes of isolation and survival.The audience discovers Catalina sheltering in place alone after a catastrophic storm. She performs for the camera, desperate to reach her audience, and her mother, through the lens.How else can I help?Please help us spread the word!Share our campaign on the Faceplace and the Tweeter.And follow us on Instagram (@khattie and @_jennylars_) for all things JKJK.Who is team Catalina La O?khattieQ (creator) is a musician and performer from Puerto Rico.

<h3>Let's Keep Live Theatre Alive!</h3>
<p>My name is Dan Kostelec, and I play your friendly, neighbourhood Shakespeare at Renaissance Faires, schools and more all over the country in my one-man, audience-interactive Shakespeare show, ""Shakespeare Approves!"". I take some of The Bard's plays and turn them into half-hour, live-action, interactive cartoons where the audience members are the actors, props, and scenery.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you've been keeping up with the news, but the COVID-19 crisis is shutting down everything - including theatres and renaissance faires. And some of the most vulnerable people in this gig-based economy are your favourite performers from that world.</p>
<p><i>12th Night and the 3 Bears - Live and Online! </i>is planned to be just the first in a series of online performances on Facebook where I gather some of my friends - your favourite actors from the Renaissance Faire community - to do live readings of my shows that I normally perform at the renaissance faires - shows like <i>Macbeth: Death By Fluffy Kittens!, Titus Andronicus: Ya Know - For Kids!, </i>and<i> Romeo &amp; Juliet: The Flying Implement of Doom Edition!</i></p>
<p>I'm looking to raise $1,100.00 for this first performance, so that I can guarantee each actor a minimum of $100 for their time in bringing us joy and laughter. And that's where you come in. We need your help to make it happen!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $1,100.00.</p>
<ul>
<li>9 actors, earning $100 each</li>
<li>Indiegogo's fees</li>
<li>A little bit to maybe start the next show</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you get? A part in the show!</p>
<p>If you're familiar with my live, in-person ren faire show, you know that I use the audience members as my cast, the set, even as some of the props. So keeping with that tradition, if you are able to donate to this cause, the first 4 people to donate <strong>$50 or more</strong> will get to be in the show. Yeah, it sounds like pay-to-play, because it is. But if you can afford it, I guarantee that you'll have a marvelous time!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will directly be helping professional entertainers keep ""professional"" as part of their job title, by helping us to pay our bills, buy our groceries (when we dare to venture outside during this social distancing period), and not sink deeper into poverty or credit card debt.</p>
<p>You're helping to extend hope and build morale for our fellow members of humanity by giving them a much-needed distraction during this crisis, a sense that a return-to-normal is not just possible but inevitable.</p>
<p>You're keeping live theatre alive.</p>

<p>Alma Theatre is the brainchild of married duo Aksam Alyousef (playwright/producer) and Amena Shehab (actor). <i>Hagar</i> is their first mainstage theatre venture since arriving to Edmonton from Syria in the mid-2010s. The Canadian mainstage debut for Alyousef. <strong><i>Hagar </i>will be presented at the ATB Financial Arts Barns in Edmonton from June 1-8, 2018, including two Arabic-language performances sponsored by the Syrian Cultural Heritage Association. </strong></p>
<p>While <i>Hagar</i> is not based on any one individual’s true story, it incorporates common, painful truths about the human toll of the Syrian refugee crisis into an honest, harrowing narrative. Part of Alyousef’s motivation for writing <i>Hagar</i> was to provide an outlet for audiences to “understand the deep humanity Canada has shown by receiving refugees as human beings, and not as a nuisance or as intruders. It is a thank-you letter to Canadians, and also a portrait of the [situation] that many refugees face.” With over 5,000 Syrian refugees having settled in Alberta from 2015-2017 alone, this international story has very local connections, told by two of Edmonton’s newest, distinct artistic voices.</p>
<p>Alyousef and Shehab have partnered with Edmonton and Toronto-based director Morgan Norwich, director of Canadian Fringe Festival circuit hit Redheaded Stepchild. <i>Hagar</i> is stage managed by FengYi (Mona) Jiang and features projection design by Alexander Boldt.</p>

A song of wanting, waiting, and hoping for someone to care for. He wrote a series of songs about this wanting and waiting. He turned to his good friend and playwright Frank Williams with the idea for a new musical they could co-write. They sat on park benches smoking cigarettes and talked about the stupid games we all played to get that someone to care for them. These talks became <i>Benches a Musical</i>. The show consumed their lives for awhile and a few workshops were performed but they never quite found it's voice.  They let it go for awhile.</p>
<p>      Time and a whole lot of life experience found the true voice of <i>Benches</i> for Ryan and Williams. The friends they made 20 years ago are still in their lives. Some remain close while others drifted away. Ryan, prompted by a recent life changing moment, realized that <i>Benches</i> is not about the stupid games played on proverbial park benches. </p>
<p>    <i>Benches</i> is about the back and forth journey we take to find the people who we'll need the most throughout our time here on earth. It's about sharing the memories and laughs but letting go of the past. <i>Benches</i> is about our partners,families, and friends. The show follows the journey of 8 friends and lovers from their university days to middle age. We see them happy. We see them drift apart and reunite after many years when one of them is in great need.</p>

</div></div>","So, why Benches?      20 years ago, Matthew Eamon Ryan wrote a song. A song of wanting, waiting, and hoping for someone to care for. He wrote a series of songs about this wanting and waiting. He turned to his good friend and playwright Frank Williams with the idea for a new musical they could co-write. They sat on park benches smoking cigarettes and talked about the stupid games we all played to get that someone to care for them. These talks became Benches a Musical. The show consumed their lives for awhile and a few workshops were performed but they never quite found it's voice.  They let it go for awhile.
      Time and a whole lot of life experience found the true voice of Benches for Ryan and Williams. The friends they made 20 years ago are still in their lives. Some remain close while others drifted away. Ryan, prompted by a recent life changing moment, realized that Benches is not about the stupid games played on proverbial park benches. 
    Benches is about the back and forth journey we take to find the people who we'll need the most throughout our time here on earth. It's about sharing the memories and laughs but letting go of the past. Benches is about our partners,families, and friends. The show follows the journey of 8 friends and lovers from their university days to middle age. We see them happy. We see them drift apart and reunite after many years when one of them is in great need.

Who are we?
     Cobblestones Theatre Company is a brand new Boston area theatre company founded by Matt Ryan focused on bringing new musicals to life for Boston audiences. We chose to present Benches in concert style for 1 night in the coming year at a Boston area theater to introduce its moving rock score to Boston audiences and introduce Cobblestones Theatre Company to the public.
   What We Need & What You Get 
We have simple needs for a 1 night show but simple needs can add up sometimes.    

Space rental along with amenities-$1,750
Paying our actors and musicians-$1,950
Rehearsal space-$500
Marketing materials including graphic design-$800

Insurance-$200                                                                                                                               What you get

You can say you were part of the re-birth of a  great rock musical and be part of the birth of a brand new theatre company.
You get to see and hear new musical theatre in its infancy before it's fully staged.
A whole slew of perks await you if you donate to our humble event. 



    The Impact

Benches a Musical  has the potential to not only help fund full-scale productions of the full show in the future but also could help launch Cobblestones Theatre Company  on a high note. A very high note.

It could help us introduce and produce other new musicals along side Benches.

We want you to share in the reflective power and unending passion of new musical theatre and its writers. 

   Risks & Challenges
The greatest challenge for any new work is finding its audience. Sharing our campaign will go a long way towards meeting that challenge. Another challenge is time. Daytime survival jobs and varied schedules give us a small window to perfect this moving piece. We as producers, writers, and actors risk passionately putting our heart and soul into the project without a built-in audience to share in that passion. We do know that once the audience is found they'll stay with us to the end.

<p>We are excited to announce and launch JUMP-START: tRpnyc! a campaign to support, establish, and build the infrastructure of the New York based dance company, Johnnie Cruise Mercer/TheREDprojectNYC! </p>
<p>Founded in Richmond, VA in August 2014, the company made its move to New York City in May 2015 to further its growth and deepen its explorative practices!  Dedicated to investigative the human subconscious through movement, while revealing the strength in human vulnerability, the company creates work that provoke emotional responses to political and contemporary happenings. </p>
<p>This year has been amazing for the company here in New York City, performing in various venues including; Gibney Dance Agnes Varis Performing Arts Center, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, Eden's Expressway at Movement Research, Harlem Repertory Theater, The Greenspace, Center for Performance Research, and even a recent residency at University Texas at Austin within the Department of Theater and Dance! </p>
<p>Though we have achieved a lot this past year, we are now prepared for the next stage in our development as a company as we solidify our administrative foundation. In an effort to budget funds for studio space, take care of administrative fees, as well as take the first steps towards producing our first NYC season! </p>

</h3>
<p>The company’s 2016-2017 season will see the development and reworking of both current and new works as we continue to cement our presence in the New York dance community. </p>
<p>In order to develop new/current pieces the company must constantly establish a practice and rehearse together.

<p>A number of residencies have been confirmed in the coming months including, Silo Farm House in Pennsylvania in June, and Denmark Arts Center in Maine in October. Both residencies are only possible if funding is found to support the food and travel of all artists involved. Both residencies will play a major role in the creation process and connectivity of the growing company of millennials.</p>
<p>The funds will also play a major role in paying for marketing, community engagement, and other administrative fees. In order to expand the reach of the company, energy must be put towards both building a strong social media presence as well as expanding our current media base! Administrative fees also include application fees, festival fees, and other miscellaneous items that usually come out of pocket.  </p>
<p>Each landmark discussed above will lead to a culminating NYC Season in 2017 at Center for Performance Research! All media, marketing, works being explored/created/rehearsed during the upcoming period will become the blueprint for this monumental inaugural season!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenge</h3>
<div>There are many risks and challenges related to this campaign and the process of creating within the contemporary company structure. One primary challenge is the issue of time and money. The current company of millennial artists is working tirelessly to create with minimal pay understanding they are paving the frontier for the RED project in New York City. All rehearsal space, and other related fees come out of personal finances. If our projected goal is not met the artists will continue to sacrifice, however, this becomes taxing on all involved. This campaign lightens the load financially on all parties involved, creating a window for space to play, create, and engage in dance freely. <br/>

<blockquote>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;"">The morning session will consist of rigorous technical training that includes improvisation, embodied anatomy, Alexander Technique, and full-bodied phrase-work.

I'm an LA-based dancer, choreographer, & artist.
Tenses by Pia Mannikko ©. (2015)
I've been dancing since I was 3 years old and earned a BA in dance at UCLA.

This summer I've been accepted into a once-in-a-lifetime graduate course at CSU Monterey Bay featuring the Trisha Brown Dance Company...


...this will be my first ever dance intensive!!

I am 1 of 26 dancers invited from an international applicant pool, and have been awarded a partial scholarship.

Without your help, I won't be able to attend this program!

Trisha Brown Dance Company & repertoire:
""Trisha Brown Dance Company (TBDC) is a post-modern dance company dedicated to the performance, and preservation of the work of Founding Artistic Director and Choreographer, Trisha Brown. Established in 1970, TBDC has toured throughout the world presenting the work, teaching and building relationships with audiences and artists alike."" www.trishabrowncompany.com

Brown considered Son of Gone Fishin'  ""the apogee of complexity"" in all of her choreography, and the end result is a seamless and fluid 20 minutes of movement. To learn more about this work, here's an interview with Diane Madden, Associate Artistic Director of TBDC, conducted by The Dance Enthusiast.

I'll have the honor and privilege to study directly under former TBDC company members and world-renown master artists Eva Karczag & Lisa Kraus.

What will the course be like?


Here's a synopsis from the CSU Monterey Bay class syllabus:

The morning session will consist of rigorous technical training that includes improvisation, embodied anatomy, Alexander Technique, and full-bodied phrase-work. The afternoon training will be based on applying the material from the morning into collaboration, composition, and performance. The course culminates with a public student performance, which will be a contemporary translation of this historical work created by the students and mentored by the teaching artists.

I CAN'T WAIT to perform this dance piece knowing  it's challenges and the weight it holds for the dance community and the form's history!
In addition to very full days in the studio, we will be attending evening lectures, forums, readings, special performances, and will have the chance to use the studios for our own physical practice.

We are both graduates of Illinois State University with majors in acting. As our senior year drew to a close last Spring, we found ourselves clinging to the walls of our favorite bar (Maggie Mileys. Duhr.) thirsting to do a capstone project that encapsulated all of our experiences as friends at ISU. Hence, ""Best Show Ever!"" was born. We are both aspiring actresses, but with idols such as Mindy Kaling, Tina Fey and Diablo Cody paving the way, we decided to try our pizza grease-drenched hands at writing a short comedy. As our show was majestically received, we then decided to dream bigger. After taking some bad@$$ improv classes in Chicago, Ashlyn found LA's Written Comedy Festival through iO West. We took a chance and submitted ""Best Show Ever!"". Yeah folks. We got in. We have the opportunity to perform our show at the festival in front of some uber important folks, as well as learn from and network with big time comedy writers currently in the television scene. As we found out about this oh, say, 3 days ago and the festival is February 16th-22nd, ANY AND ALL OF YOUR HELP is necessary to make this happen for us! The magnitude of a few dollars on your end well help make our dream a major reality! </div><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>1. We need $3000. Yeah, harrowing much? But it's not going to getting our weaves done! Promise! We need...</p><p>- A rental car. Because LA's public transport sux. </p><p>- Hotel cost for 6 nights. </p><p>- Plane travel from Chicago to Los Angeles and back.</p><p>- Small amount of consumable props we need. (Because who doesn't want to see us shoving our faces with pizza while singing karaoke?) </p><p>- We get discounts on tickets to the assorted workshops throughout the week, but we still do need to purchase our tickets. Therefore, in order to be able to take advantage of these unique and incredible opportunities, we need extra funding! </p><p>2. And what do you get...? HMMM???</p><p>You will receive a myriad of gifts from us if you choose to donate!

We're Hannah and Ashlyn (also known as BABYCHILD). We are both graduates of Illinois State University with majors in acting. As our senior year drew to a close last Spring, we found ourselves clinging to the walls of our favorite bar (Maggie Mileys. Duhr.) thirsting to do a capstone project that encapsulated all of our experiences as friends at ISU. Hence, ""Best Show Ever!"" was born. We are both aspiring actresses, but with idols such as Mindy Kaling, Tina Fey and Diablo Cody paving the way, we decided to try our pizza grease-drenched hands at writing a short comedy. As our show was majestically received, we then decided to dream bigger. After taking some bad@$$ improv classes in Chicago, Ashlyn found LA's Written Comedy Festival through iO West. We took a chance and submitted ""Best Show Ever!"". Yeah folks. We got in. We have the opportunity to perform our show at the festival in front of some uber important folks, as well as learn from and network with big time comedy writers currently in the television scene. As we found out about this oh, say, 3 days ago and the festival is February 16th-22nd, ANY AND ALL OF YOUR HELP is necessary to make this happen for us! The magnitude of a few dollars on your end well help make our dream a major reality! What We Need & What You Get1. We need $3000. Yeah, harrowing much? But it's not going to getting our weaves done! Promise! We need...- A rental car. Because LA's public transport sux. - Hotel cost for 6 nights. - Plane travel from Chicago to Los Angeles and back.- Small amount of consumable props we need. (Because who doesn't want to see us shoving our faces with pizza while singing karaoke?) - We get discounts on tickets to the assorted workshops throughout the week, but we still do need to purchase our tickets. Therefore, in order to be able to take advantage of these unique and incredible opportunities, we need extra funding! 2. And what do you get...? HMMM???You will receive a myriad of gifts from us if you choose to donate! From social media shout-outs, to a written scene inspired by a life story of yours, a thank-you card to a tee-shirt with one of our show's one-liners, we will DEFINITELY show you the love if you show us some! Any funds we make will go toward as much of the trip as we can. NONE of it will go to waste and will all go towards this event. The ImpactThis festival gives us an opportunity to perform a show that we feel passionate about and showcases who we are as actors and people. It played a huge role in how we view ourselves as theatre artists today, and would be an honor to have the opportunity to introduce it to a wider audience and see it through this far. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't spare a buck, our love don't cost a thang!

<div>Our evening length dance piece will be presented at The WhiteBox Art Center in New York City on December 6th, 2014. In collaboration with The People Movers, the piece is part of CRAWL, a unique and contemporary model for arts presentation in New York City. Taking place in four distinct venues in various neighborhoods across the city, each production features two emerging choreographers as well as a third artistic act. Enza DePalma, Christine Jeager, and Lydia Zimmer will each present their work in an evening of visual and physical art. </div> <p></p>
<h4><strong>BLOOM</strong></h4>
<p>Somewhere secluded and far from us, there is a house. A house that, even in the cold of winter, can have brightness and life.</p>
<p>The feeling of a home is created by what's around you. Adding furniture and personal items make a space yours. Sharing that space with others creates memories. </p>
<p>The conversations and experiences had in the rooms of your house breathe life into your home. <em>Bloom</em> peers into a house, far away from us, and discovers the life that lives inside it. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>It takes a lot to put a whole show together! We have a wonderful team working countless hours to get this going; with The People Movers as our co-producer and The WhiteBox Art Center as our venue, we definitely have a good foundation, but we need your help too. </p>
<p>The space to create the actual dance costs money. Studio space in New York City ranges from $10 per hour to $25 per hour and we need a studio to move our bodies and explore! Part of your generous donations will go to the cost of studio rental.</p>
<p>Scheduling is always a conflict when 6 people are involved, we want to make sure that we are compensating our artists for their time and commitment to the project, part of your generous donations will go to supporting our dancers.</p>
<p>There are two major parts of this production that need your help the most. </p>
<p>The first is our imaginative and large scale set pieces. As you may have seen in the video above, ENZA creates large scale light installations for many of our shows. Bloom is no different, to create the feeling of the house there will be furniture pieces lit by fluorescent lights in the space. The dancers will move and manipulate these set pieces while telling their story. The furniture can be found easily, we always enjoy the challenge of finding used pieces, however the lights that go on them are more of an investment. A large part of your generous donations will go to the cost of the beautiful lights.</p>
<p>And the second, we are fortunate enough to have a beautifully talented dancer in our company who also plays the piano. For Bloom, it is our goal to have a piano as part of our set on stage. Not only to add to our design but to be played and have live accompaniment to our dancers. This combination of live music, set design and multifaceted dancers is a collaboration that we could not be more excited about. We've been lucky enough to work with Beethoven Pianos in New York City and have the rental cost of the piano waved, however pianos cannot move themselves and the moving cost in and out of our venue cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>The majority of your generous donations will go to the moving cost of a beautiful white piano to be played throughout our performance. </p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi my name’s Emily and dancing is in my blood, coming from a long line of successful dancers. It’s what I think about night and day. Even when I’m tired, I just want to dance. I love the way it feels, entertaining people and continuing a legacy of classic dance from my great-grandmother down to me.<br/>The problem is that I live in a small fishing village on the Pacific coast where dance opportunities are minimal, dancing at a small local studio and in my bedroom which I’ve converted into a ballet studio. I recently made my way to an audition for Goh Ballet, Vancouver and they accepted me on the spot! The problem is Tuition and Lodging add up to $20,000 annually, and the fact is, if I can’t raise the money, I can’t go.</p>
<p>Continuing dance at Goh will open doors for me into professional dance, my passion and career of choice. With your help, I know I can make it.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Tuition is $7000</p>
<p>Lodging is $13000</p>
<p>Ferry costs are $1200</p>
<p>Shoes and uniform costs are $ 750</p>
<p>I will send you updated photos, YouTube videos of me dancing and updates on performances.</p>
<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
<p>This would mean the world to me if you help me reach my dream.</p>
<p>I have dreamed about attending a professional ballet school since I was little, now it may be a reality and I don't want it to slip away.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know everyone may not be financially able to contribute, so I will ask for you to please share with your friends, family and social networks. You can always use the Indiegogo share options as well.</p>

<h2>Why Fund on Indiegogo?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Why not? Conventional funding is very hard to get.  Since we are doing it for the people, why not go to the people! Sometimes we think its just the corporate guys or the rich and famous that get all the opportunities and are in a position to become a producer of project. BUT, ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND I HAVE JUST AS MUCH POWER, IF WE ACTIVATE IT!  The bible has countless stories of God using ordinary people. So, while I first resisted the suggestions to do crowd-funding, I decided, why not take it to the people and here we are. LET'S USE OUR GOD GIVEN POWER TODAY! </p>

Veronica Brown (Composer) is a product of the beautiful crescent city of New Orleans, LA. Having a father and grandfather as music mentors, she has always had strong aspirations to enter the entertainment industry. Currently she is working on her first album with plans to release it this year. Song writing has always been one of her passions and she has committed to doing more of that these days. Veronica strongly believes you can reach any goal if you try hard enough and ALWAYS keep God first.
Jonathan  Floyd's (Composer) guitar licks will grab you with a familiar lilt and an unknown seduction that makes it clear why the lead guitar is in fact the leader of the jazzy string family. But this jazzman knows funk and he has certainly flirted with R&B. Jonathan Floyd's guitar is prominent on the remix of Al B Sure's hit ""Right Now."" This Cum Laude graduate of the University of Albuquerque is an original member of New York's Black Rock Coalition. Jon has toured with Living Color, and he's been an executive at VAP Records, Malibu Records and Jon Ray Music Publishing company. He is the Musical Director for the group Forecast.

Why Fund on Indiegogo?
Why not? Conventional funding is very hard to get.  Since we are doing it for the people, why not go to the people! Sometimes we think its just the corporate guys or the rich and famous that get all the opportunities and are in a position to become a producer of project. BUT, ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND I HAVE JUST AS MUCH POWER, IF WE ACTIVATE IT!  The bible has countless stories of God using ordinary people. So, while I first resisted the suggestions to do crowd-funding, I decided, why not take it to the people and here we are. LET'S USE OUR GOD GIVEN POWER TODAY! 
 
                                                          
 
What's In It For Me?
Besides great benefits as outlined in our ""Perk"" section, ""BRAGGING RIGHTS""!  You helped fund a show destined for New York!  You did that!

<h3>Winter Under The Table<br/>
</h3>“WINTER UNDER THE TABLE” by Roland Topor is returning to the New York
 stage after 12 years. With a new translation by Eniko Imre, Pilvax 
Productions is reintroducing this lesser known, delightful French comedy
 with an international cast.
<p>Roland Topor was a jack-of-all-trades in the field of creative 
art. With notable works as an illustrator, graphic designer, author, 
playwright, film maker, song writer, actor and creator of innovative 
television programming, he was well known and much loved all throughout 
Europe. His most famous novel, “The Tenant” (1976), was adapted into a 
film by Roman Polanski. Somewhat revisiting the subject of that movie, 
“WINTER UNDER THE TABLE” was written in 1994 for the National Theatre in
 Mannheim, Germany.</p>
<p>Pilvax Productions, who has brought Zsolt Pozsgai’s “Liselotte in
 May” to the New York stage last year at the Dream Up Festival, is 
presenting this rare piece of European theatre. With directions by Timea
 Zsedely, it promises to entertain a wide array of theatre goers. Next 
to the thought provoking concept and subject matter, the play surly will
 provide ample entertainment with humorous situations, dialogues and 
physical comedy.</p>
<p>The play revolves around five characters from different social 
backgrounds. The story begins with Florence (Lisa Hufnagel), a middle 
class translator of foreign literature. For an extra boost to help her 
pay the rent, she sublets the underside of her dining table to an 
illegal immigrant. Her tenant is the attentive eastern European 
shoemaker, Dragomir (Roland Udvari), who’s previous addresses include a 
boiler room, a hollowed out tree trunk and even a family crypt. Their 
growing camaraderie is slightly sat back and complicated by the arrival 
of Dragomir’s free-spirited cousin Gritzka (Miklos Solyom). The three 
quickly begin to discover “trom” in each others company. However, this 
undefinable element to happiness, is disturbed by Florence’s friend, an 
upper-class divorcée, Raymond (Eszter Kovacs) and an overachieving, 
white-collar suitor, Marc (Christopher Kardos), who happens to be 
Florance’s publisher.</p>
<p>What happens to these people as their world of social and economic situations collide? Come and find out.</p>
<p>“WINTER UNDER THE TABLE” will be performed at The Gene Frankel Theater (24 Bond St New York, NY 10012) from September 11<sup>th</sup> through the 14<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>We Need Your Help.</h3>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Our Hungarian based theater company called Pilvax Productions located in New 
York prefers European plays related to American topics as immigration, 
integration or solidarity. As enthusiastic theater lovers we like the classic, 
humanistic and naturally dramatized problems on stage as love, friendship, jealousy or poverty. This play is about all of these exciting human 
conditions and current economical issues. This delightful absurdist piece explores the themes of immigration, 
difference, integration, friendship and mostly the charm of love with great 
warmth and humor. <br/>We would like to give a memorable, joyful and valued piece of art to our 
audience.  Your help 
certainly will create a wonderful international theater event in New York.<br/>

  The ImpactOur Hungarian based theater company called Pilvax Productions located in New 
York prefers European plays related to American topics as immigration, 
integration or solidarity. As enthusiastic theater lovers we like the classic, 
humanistic and naturally dramatized problems on stage as love, friendship, jealousy or poverty. This play is about all of these exciting human 
conditions and current economical issues. This delightful absurdist piece explores the themes of immigration, 
difference, integration, friendship and mostly the charm of love with great 
warmth and humor. We would like to give a memorable, joyful and valued piece of art to our 
audience.  Your help 
certainly will create a wonderful international theater event in New York.

<p>Welcome to the
Cinderelleigh Pantomime Indiegogo campaign!  </p>
<p>I am a freelance film and theatre producer who has 15 years experience and have worked on many films and theatre including Calendar Girls, Made in Dagenham and Jane Eyre.  I also helped produce a panto that was seen at the Edinburgh Fringe at The Gilded Balloon.  I am putting on a family, fun, alternative panto in Leigh on Sea in Essex this year.  It is affordable
for all, as a good community project should be, and all proceeds are going to
three great local charities HARP (for homeless people), YMCA (16-25 homeless people) and Sunflower Trust (families of disabled children). The show will
utilise all the amazing local talent we have here and raise some money for good
causes.  I also hope it be a legacy project and be done for years to
benefit the community.  Leigh Town Council is providing the rooms for rehearsals and show but there is no other money and everyone involved is working for free.   </p>
<p>The £2000 I am hoping to raise is for one reason only - to make the show look AMAZING! Production
Design, Costume Design, Lighting and Printing costs. Although this is a
community project we really want it to have high production values and for that
we need a bit of a cash injection.  We have so much talent onboard already: professional costume designer Pip Hazell, professional production designer Jo McLoughlin who has over twenty years experience and theatre director Jo Melville who has a huge amount of stage experience. The script has been written by published local writer Samantha Lierens. We also already have some fantastic cast members onboard including Elisa Adams as our eponymous Cinderelleigh. Elisa is a well known local jazz singer who recently performed in a successful play at The Yard Theatre in East London and hosts her own nights locally and Ami Anders a singer and actor who recently performed at The Hippodrome, as Fairy Godmother.  The cast and crew are
all giving up their precious time for weeks before Christmas to make the show
come alive so it would be nice to feed them occasionally.</p>
<p>We've got some fun incentives to help with your generosity including being name checked in the show and front row seats. Take a look! Let me make it clear though ANY AMOUNT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO PLEASE GET INVOLVED. </p>
<p>Any money raised will
help the show, £2000 is the ideal, anything will help with costs and ultimately we will work with what we have.  We have an amazing crew all working for free who could create something magical with a bit of cash behind them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>This project will be so
important for the community of Leigh on Sea.  Not just for the money it is
raising for the three charities but also raising awareness of the arts for all
pockets and using the amazing space that is the community centre.  Young,
old, professional and beginners are all being given the opportunity to take
part. The cast are all local and all extremely talented.  It's going to be a great show! </span></p>
<p>We are also asking local
businesses for help and looking for a main sponsor.</p>

<p>Love Machine is a story in 3 parts. Each part takes us further and further into the future as technology gets closer and closer to the human experience. The show looks at patterns in the way we use technology today and imagines some of the possible situations that may arise in artificial intelligence and the increase of virtual interactions. </p>

In order to provide transport and accommodation in New Orleans, and to stay true our vision with new sets, costumes and lighting, we need to raise $7,000 through Indiegogo. The cast and design team are professionals who generously volunteer their time because they believe in the work the collective is producing. You can make your contribution to support emerging artists here OR:
To make a tax-deductible donation through The Field:

Check: Make checks out to The Field. In the memo section, please write Nessa Norich/Tremor Collective to ensure it gets to us!  Mail checks to: Tremor Collective c/o Helena Martel, Apt. 12, 243 Henry Street, New York, NY
Credit Card: Go to the Contribute To A Sponsored Artist page. Select Nessa Norich from the list. Click ""Contribute"" and follow the prompts.

The bigger picture: 
Tremor was founded by Lecoq and Barnard College alumna Nessa Norich. Norich created the collective not only as a platform for her own imaginings but to foster an ideal creative environment where actors are encouraged to play and create. We focus on nourishing the artist through a research and development process that is as intellectually stimulating as it is physically engaging. The product is a richly immersive experience for our audience. 
We cannot do this without you and everyone you know! After you've made your contribution, please share this page with everyone in your address book. We hope to reach art enthusiasts around the world!

<p> </p>
<p>We are a new theater company in Los Angeles, and have decided to start off with a bang by doing RENT, by Jonathan Larson. This piece won a Tony Award for Best Musical in 1996, and was groundbreaking and ""the first of its kind"", when it hit the stage. We decided to make RENT our first official Mainstage Production, because it has had a massive and personal impact on so many people. The late Jonathan Larson wrote it to bring light to the AIDS epidemic that was so prominent in New York in the 80's, and to tell the stories of struggling yet passionate artists, many of whom were outcasts in one way or another. Most people who see this show, see a version of themselves in at least one of the very colorful characters in this ensemble piece. Everyone in our company and cast is passionate about this piece, and we hope you will be too!</p>
<p>We have also established partnerships with AIDS Project LA (APLA), Being Alive, and AIDS Research Alliance (ARA), which are all local organizations that provide AIDS research and support, and we are working on a few more local partnerships, and some proceeds from our ticket sales will go towards supporting these causes. RENT is a massive undertaking because it demands high quality in sound equipment, set design and construction, costumes and props, lighting design and equipment, music, etc., and we are determined to bring Jonathan Larson's story to life thoroughly and completely!</p>
<p>We are also putting up a second production that will run simultaneously, twice a week, during the run of RENT. That production is going to be Steven Dietz's PRIVATE EYES. This is a very intelligent, hilarious, dark comedy that will run on Thursday nights and Saturday matinees, every week that RENT is running, as a sister-production.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are doing a three-part <span class=""il"">indiegogo</span> campaign, and there are special perks for donating to all three campaigns. WE EXCEEDED OUR GOAL OF $2000 DURING PART ONE!! This is the second leg, and we are looking to raise $5000 as we launch into rehearsals, and are hiring our whole technical/production team. But let's try and surpass that, and get our next campaign going before it even starts! Any and all contributions are much appreciated, and there will be perks like free tickets to the shows, and some to our opening night reception and gala, free refreshments at the theater, posters and programs signed by the cast, tickets to our fall show and sister production, and even getting your name spray painted on our set!</p>
<p>If we do not make our goal, a larger portion of what we do raise is witheld from us, so it's very important that we reach it! If it is not possible for you to contribute, you can still help us by spreading the word. Sharing this event on Facebook, twitter, and telling your community about us in whatever way you can, helps out too! </p>

Thank you for taking a moment to read a little bit about our organization, its legacy, and how important its success is to hundreds of students every year at Northwestern University.</p>
<p><strong>The Dolphin Show</strong></p>
<p>The Dolphin Show dates back to the 1940s, when the men’s swim team put on an underwater musical as the group fundraiser. Since its inception in 1942, the show has moved from the pool to Cahn Auditorium—the space it now calls home.  Over the decades, Northwestern’s student theatre community has grown into a vibrant world for those interested in the arts, with the Dolphin Show remaining the centerpiece: the largest student-produced musical in the country.</p>
<p>This year, we are especially proud to present <em>My Fair Lady, </em>with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. With timeless themes and its roots going back to Greek mythology, we feel that <em>My Fair Lady</em> provides enjoyment matched by few other musicals. We are so excited to be able to present a show loved by audiences around the world!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>As an entirely student-run production, we rely solely on the generosity of our donors and our independent fundraising efforts. Initiatives like this one and others will all combine to provide our young artists with a budget deserving of a nationally recognized theatre tradition. Here are some of the things that are usually major expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>SET: Our show is produced in Cahn Auditorium, which is a gigantic theatrical space that seats almost 1000 audience members. Building a theatrical set that fills the stage and provides space for our forty performers is no small feat. Your donation can help us execute this massive design element.</li>
<li>COSTUMES: Did we mention that there are forty performers? The average cast member in our show has 3 costumes, which is already a lot before you consider that many of these costumes (for <em>My Fair Lady)</em> are designed to evoke the early 20th Century British upper class. Your donation allows the clothes on our performers' back to match the grandiose artistry of the scenery.</li>
<li>MARKETING: As part of the fulfillment of Dolphin's tradition, we aim to attract the widest demographic of audience available to us in the Northwestern area. This includes every student from every community on campus, Evanston residents and Chicago theatre enthusiasts. In a busy theatre city, this is a massive undertaking, and one our Marketing Team can succeed at with your support!</li>
<li>MUCH MORE: Lights, props, sound, equipment, events, the list goes on and on. Every cent you can contribute will benefit a facet of what it takes to put on a production of this magnitude!</li>
</ul><p><strong>Attend the Show!</strong></p>
<p>We sincerely hope you will come watch this incredible show come to life from January 25-February 2<sup>nd</sup> in Northwestern’s Cahn Auditorium.  Purchase your ticket in advance at <a href=""http://www.nudolphinshow.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nudolphinshow.org</a> to ensure you see this groundbreaking production.

For the last 30 <strong>years I have been the artistic director of the only professional Italian music, dance and theatre company in the United States I GIULLARI DI PIAZZA</strong> (the Players of the Square) a <strong>non -profit organization</strong> with whom I won several awards. We have been <strong>artists in residence at the Cathedral of St John the Divine in New York City</strong> since 1993 where we have performed many shows.</p>
<p><strong>WHO I AM</strong></p>
<p>In addition to my performances I often work as a teacher and healer, mostly for women, through my special drumming and dance workshops. This summer, French <strong>film maker Manex Ibar made a documentary</strong> about me and my work as healer/artist which will be released on<strong> BBC television entitled LIVING SHAMANISM.</strong> <strong>The Russian TV Travel Channel</strong> also filmed my workshop in Tuscany, Italy  focusing on the tarantella trance dance .</p>
<p>I have healed many people from depression and other emotional/physical problem through the tarantella trance dance and I have written a musical based on this story, which derives from an ancient women's ritual. I feel this powerful women tradition must be brought into the world and more commercial main stream theatre.</p>
<p><strong>THE HEALING POWER OF OUR SHOW</strong></p>
<p> For the last 5 years I have been performing and evolving this powerful production entitled TARANTELLA SPIDER DANCE with my wonderful company which includes a cast of 20 performers, including acrobats, an amazing stilt dancer, an aerial dancer, fire dancers, and musicians, actors, dancers and vocalists specializing in traditional Southern Italian folk music, dance, ritual theatre.</p>
<p>This unique production is one of kind. It is a sensual, mystical show about the healing power of the Tarantella trance dance based on the myth of the tarantula, the ecstatic rites of Dionysus and the need of women today to heal their depression through drumming and dance.</p>
<p><strong>When and where will our project take place </strong></p>
<p><em>The current version of the show has evolved since its award-winning <strong>1996 premiere at Alice Tully Hall/Lincoln Center.</strong> The revised 2007 version has been performed several times to sold out audiences at New York City’s Theatre for the New City and Theatre at Riverside Church and at venues in Lerici (Italy) and Spain.</em></p>
<p>We are getting closer to the goal of making Spider Dance into an open ended off-Broadway show. To do this we need to present a showcase to possible investors and producers. We urgently do need your support to complete this project as our funding from the State has been cut and has not been released.</p>
<p>  We have scheduled a new and exciting version of <strong>“TARANTELLA SPIDER DANCE” for the week of <a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""x-apple-data-detectors://1/"">January 18, 2013</a> for 3 performances - Jan 18,19 &amp; 20 at Theatre for the New City</strong> where the show has been presented to sold out audiences.</p>
<p><strong>What we need funding for</strong></p>

<p>I have dedicated my artistic life to the research and revival of this rich and powerful culture from Southern Italy and after 30 years of hard work I feel that this musical can contribute to the heritage of the Italians in American . My show also tells the story of many women who have suffered abuse and depression, and it is dedicated to the healing power of the Tarantella and other trance dances around the world. A musical that empowers women through drumming and dance has never been done before.</p>
<p>TARANTELLA SPIDER DANCE tells the compelling ancient story of SPIDER WOMAN, who is an amazing aerial dancer, the mystical power of the tarantella mixed with the eroticism and sensuality of this women's healing trance dance of liberation, played by me on my magical tambourine, the uniqueness of this untold woman's story and the many surprises (fire dancer, stilt dancers) make SPIDER DANCE a possible off-Broadway hit that a could run for many years. It also has great possibility for touring in the US, Italy Brazil and perhaps a long run in Las Vegas. It could become the ""Italian"" River Dance, centered on the Italian dance of the Tarantella, a musical, enchanting, powerful, erotic, and healing dance from <em>Puglia.</em></p>
<p>  <strong>Why our project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPIDER DANCE is  a</strong> spectacular show (in the vein of FELA, ObaOba, Riverdance) that could become a successful long Off-Broadway run in a New York theatre of at least [299 ] seats and at most [499 ] seats. We are facing a challenging time in the world and in times like this the public needs the positive energy and healing experience that this production brings through this collective ritual of liberation .  In our previous performances the audience always left the theatre mesmerized and you can see it on our presentation video.</p>
<p><strong><em> The show also</em></strong><em> : showcases Greek and Italian mythology, traditional and modern music instrumentation and choreography.  Displays the curative and transformative powers of “trance” dance.  Appeals to a wide and diverse audience.  </em><em>Has  educational opportunities: classes and workshops on trance dance &amp; drumming.</em></p>
<p>     <strong>WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST</strong></p>
<p> Our Company I GIULLARI DI PIAZZA, funded in 1980 has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, Madison Square Garden, Cleveland Museum of Art, Getty Center, Epcot center and many more.</p>
<p>I have written and directed many folk Operas. Our first <strong>TARANTATA DANCE OF THE ANCIENT SPIDER was commissioned by Lincoln Center</strong> and presented to a sold out audience at Alice Tully hall in 1996. We have also presented other powerful productions at the Cathedral of St John the Divine , as <strong>STABAT MATER DONNA DE PARADISO, THE VOYAGE OF THE BLACK MADONNA, “LA LUPA” , THE SHEPHERDS’ SONG,</strong> always receiving wide audience and critical acclaim, many favorable reviews from the New York and Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>As a singer and a percussionist, I have done great shows around the world, <strong>(Italy, England, Poland, France, Spain, Brazil, Australia, Israel, Egypt, Korea)</strong> with great reviews and awards also from <strong>Modern Drummer and DRUM Magazine</strong> and television coverage.

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","WHO WE AREHello everyone, my name is Alessandra Belloni, I was born in Rome, Italy and live in New York City. For the last 30 years I have been the artistic director of the only professional Italian music, dance and theatre company in the United States I GIULLARI DI PIAZZA (the Players of the Square) a non -profit organization with whom I won several awards. We have been artists in residence at the Cathedral of St John the Divine in New York City since 1993 where we have performed many shows.
WHO I AM
In addition to my performances I often work as a teacher and healer, mostly for women, through my special drumming and dance workshops. This summer, French film maker Manex Ibar made a documentary about me and my work as healer/artist which will be released on BBC television entitled LIVING SHAMANISM. The Russian TV Travel Channel also filmed my workshop in Tuscany, Italy  focusing on the tarantella trance dance .
I have healed many people from depression and other emotional/physical problem through the tarantella trance dance and I have written a musical based on this story, which derives from an ancient women's ritual. I feel this powerful women tradition must be brought into the world and more commercial main stream theatre.
THE HEALING POWER OF OUR SHOW
 For the last 5 years I have been performing and evolving this powerful production entitled TARANTELLA SPIDER DANCE with my wonderful company which includes a cast of 20 performers, including acrobats, an amazing stilt dancer, an aerial dancer, fire dancers, and musicians, actors, dancers and vocalists specializing in traditional Southern Italian folk music, dance, ritual theatre.
This unique production is one of kind. It is a sensual, mystical show about the healing power of the Tarantella trance dance based on the myth of the tarantula, the ecstatic rites of Dionysus and the need of women today to heal their depression through drumming and dance.
When and where will our project take place 
The current version of the show has evolved since its award-winning 1996 premiere at Alice Tully Hall/Lincoln Center. The revised 2007 version has been performed several times to sold out audiences at New York City’s Theatre for the New City and Theatre at Riverside Church and at venues in Lerici (Italy) and Spain.
We are getting closer to the goal of making Spider Dance into an open ended off-Broadway show. To do this we need to present a showcase to possible investors and producers. We urgently do need your support to complete this project as our funding from the State has been cut and has not been released.
  We have scheduled a new and exciting version of “TARANTELLA SPIDER DANCE” for the week of January 18, 2013 for 3 performances - Jan 18,19 & 20 at Theatre for the New City where the show has been presented to sold out audiences.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of college students in Arizona starting a production company. We want to produce plays that raise 21st century issues and cause our audiences to think when they leave our shows.  </p>
<p>We are producing Bert V. Royal's DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD as our premeire production because we believe it shows how bullying a teen can effect his or her life. It is a cautionary tale as to what can happen when a group of kids in high school do not show empathy for their life long friend. This show follows CB as he has lost his dog and searches for answers to life and finds them in his lost friend. Then follows CB though more loss because his friends cannot cope with CB and Beethoven's differences from themselves.</p>
<p>Studio Now wants to bring this issue to the Valley community and raise awareness for teenagers and kids who go through similar situations in their own lives. </p>

<p>Lucy is the forgotten girl at her high school, unnoticed
except when she's being mocked and tormented. She figures her life is over
before it's begun. But that was before she met Jenny, the new girl at school
everyone is infatuated with. Before she found something in the dark
forest--something that fills her dreams with teeth and claws. Rising DC playwright Stephen Spotswood's bloody deconstruction of <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i> takes the familiar elements of
werewolves, teen lust, and high school bullies and puts them through a blender in a tale of passion, horror and revenge. <br/></p>

<h3>Help Us Scare the Crap out of You:</h3>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of CulturalDC we already have the most important and most expensive cost of producing a show covered: a place to put on a great show.<i> In The Forest, She Grew Fangs </i>will be presented as part of CulturalDC's Flashpoint Mead Theatre Lab 2013-2014 season. Flashpoint is one of the best equipped venues for young companies in the DC region, and one with which the Rogues have a history. Our very first production, 2008's <i>Busted Jesus Comix </i>was staged at Flashpoint as part of that year's Capital Fringe Festival. We could not be more excited to return to our original artistic home. <br/></p>
<p>Your contributions will go directly to concrete production needs. Lumber and paint for our set. Costumes and PR and artist fees. All the not-so-glamourous materials that talent artists use to make a great show. <br/></p>
<p>Where your money is going: <br/></p>
<ul><li>$50 - Weapon Rental - We're renting a kick ass sword from master fight choreographer Casey Kaleba. Renting a quality weapon serves two important purposes: well designed weapons are (1) safer for our actors, and (2) look really awesome. </li></ul>
<ul><li>$100 - Bloooooooooood. We're getting the good stuff: Ben Nye (yeah, THAT Ben Nye) brand stage blood. As realistic as it gets, with the bonus of being totally washable which will save both laundry money and our costume designer's sanity.</li></ul>
<ul><li> $150 - PR costs - What's a show without an audience? We'll be doing a run of postcards and flyers. We tend to keep our advertising budget small by taking advantage of social media and other free means of spreading the word. (But no advertising beats word of mouth, so tell your friends!)</li></ul>
<ul><li>$450 - Props and Costumes: Our costume designer Jesse Shipley is taking on her biggest project for the Rogues yet. On top of realistic contemporary clothing for our high school student characters, we've also got a whole blood Halloween Dance to costume. And oh yeah, we've got a werewolf. Maybe more than one. </li></ul>
<ul><li>$500 - Set. The Rogues are all about immersive environments. For<i> In The Forest, She Grew Fangs</i>, set designer Chris Holland will plunge the audience into one of the most nightmarish environments known: a high school locker room. </li></ul>
<ul><li>$750 - Artists Fees - The big one. Specifically your donations will go towards paying our talent team of set, light and sound designers. <br/>
</li></ul>
<p>No matter the outcome of this campaign, the show WILL go on. We see this campaign and all our perks as a way to offer our audience and fans unique and special ways to engage with the company and show. That's why all contributions of $20 or above come with two tickets.  Be a Rogue and bring a friend! Your contributions will help us make <i>In The Forest, She Grew Fangs </i>an even scarier and more exciting experience. <br/></p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help! </p>

WE'RE FUNDED! 
MUCH LOVE TO EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTED AND SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN! WE'LL SEE YOU ALL AT FLASHPOINT! 


October 10 - November 3, 2013 at The Flashpoint Mead Theatre Lab
directed by Ryan S. Taylor
Featuring: Megan Graves, Jenny Donovan, Luke Cieslewicz, Jane Petkofsky, Natalie Cutcher, Anna Lathrop and Megan Behm.

This fall.... Lucy goes hunting.


Lucy is the forgotten girl at her high school, unnoticed
except when she's being mocked and tormented. She figures her life is over
before it's begun. But that was before she met Jenny, the new girl at school
everyone is infatuated with. Before she found something in the dark
forest--something that fills her dreams with teeth and claws. Rising DC playwright Stephen Spotswood's bloody deconstruction of Little Red Riding Hood takes the familiar elements of
werewolves, teen lust, and high school bullies and puts them through a blender in a tale of passion, horror and revenge. 

The first reviews are in!
""...a rich mingling of worlds..."" ""...smart, unsettling, darkly poetic new play..."" - Washington Post

""Spotswood’s language is lyrical and poetic, and manages to delicately 
balance the tough and relevant subject matter of bullying with priceless
 comedic timing and moments of levity."" - DC Metro Theatre Arts (*****)


Check out our trailer, created by Ali Walton and Aaron Fisher:

Help Us Scare the Crap out of You:
Thanks to the generosity of CulturalDC we already have the most important and most expensive cost of producing a show covered: a place to put on a great show. In The Forest, She Grew Fangs will be presented as part of CulturalDC's Flashpoint Mead Theatre Lab 2013-2014 season. Flashpoint is one of the best equipped venues for young companies in the DC region, and one with which the Rogues have a history. Our very first production, 2008's Busted Jesus Comix was staged at Flashpoint as part of that year's Capital Fringe Festival. We could not be more excited to return to our original artistic home. 
Your contributions will go directly to concrete production needs. Lumber and paint for our set. Costumes and PR and artist fees. All the not-so-glamourous materials that talent artists use to make a great show. 
Where your money is going: 
$50 - Weapon Rental - We're renting a kick ass sword from master fight choreographer Casey Kaleba. Renting a quality weapon serves two important purposes: well designed weapons are (1) safer for our actors, and (2) look really awesome. 
$100 - Bloooooooooood. We're getting the good stuff: Ben Nye (yeah, THAT Ben Nye) brand stage blood. As realistic as it gets, with the bonus of being totally washable which will save both laundry money and our costume designer's sanity.
 $150 - PR costs - What's a show without an audience? We'll be doing a run of postcards and flyers. We tend to keep our advertising budget small by taking advantage of social media and other free means of spreading the word. (But no advertising beats word of mouth, so tell your friends!)
$450 - Props and Costumes: Our costume designer Jesse Shipley is taking on her biggest project for the Rogues yet. On top of realistic contemporary clothing for our high school student characters, we've also got a whole blood Halloween Dance to costume. And oh yeah, we've got a werewolf. Maybe more than one. 
$500 - Set. The Rogues are all about immersive environments. For In The Forest, She Grew Fangs, set designer Chris Holland will plunge the audience into one of the most nightmarish environments known: a high school locker room. 
$750 - Artists Fees - The big one. Specifically your donations will go towards paying our talent team of set, light and sound designers. 

No matter the outcome of this campaign, the show WILL go on. We see this campaign and all our perks as a way to offer our audience and fans unique and special ways to engage with the company and show. That's why all contributions of $20 or above come with two tickets.  Be a Rogue and bring a friend! Your contributions will help us make In The Forest, She Grew Fangs an even scarier and more exciting experience. 
Thank you so much for your help! 
- Ryan S. Taylor, Artistic Director of The Washington Rogues

We want to share that access. We're holding true to the national Never Be Dark movement meant to keep the country's theatrical spaces open and operating whenever possible.  As part of our residency we are proud to host two powerful solo performances by two amazing women. These performances will be entirely pay-what-you-can, and we are proud to announce that as part of our agreement with CulturalDC, 90 percent of tickets sales will go directly to these two great emerging playwright/performers.

""Sightlines,"" by Emmy Award nominee Mark Eisman, is an intimate two-person play about finding connection in an ever-blurring world.

Out of the light and into the darkness, they smash their way “through the looking-glass” into a Lewis Carroll world and a love story defying conventional perceptions.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">We're Eureka Suitcase, a production company dedicated to the idea that art is best served by focusing on great stories, exceptional story-telling, a reverence for the imagination of the actors and audience, and an entrepreneurial spirit in how we bring it to the people and the next great story that we'll be tackeling is our new adaptation of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST.</span></h3>
<p>While we've produced other projects before, THE TEMPEST is our first NYC production.   We've set the show in the NYC subway system and our signiture minimalist style will be a great fit inside THE TANK NYC's theatre space in Midtown Manhattan. It will be a really innovative production and we know that people will connect to it. We'll be posting designer art and other special things on the campaign wall as well as our facebook page, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/eurekasuitcase"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/eurekasuitcase</a> and our website <a href=""http://www.eurekasuitcase.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.eurekasuitcase.org</a>. So keep checking in as you tell other people about it.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We need $6,000 to pay the actors and designers for the work and time they've put in and for minimalist design elements such as props and costumes. It's a BIG show and even though we're a minimalist company, it takes top notch talent to tell the story in a simple way. We believe that professionals of all kinds deserve something for their expertise.</p>
<p><strong>And because we're working in collaboration with The Tank NYC, a 501c(3) organization, you're gift will be tax-dedictible!</strong></p>
<p>So, take a look at our tiers, decide on what you'd like to share with us, and then look at the tier above it. Chances are you'll love that gift more! And since it's tax-deductible you can give more!</p>
<p>Who wouldn't want a drunk dial voicemail from the two drunken characters in the show? I know I would. Or you can make Aaron Vega's hand cramp from writing 50 personalized sonnets. Or better yet, have your name trumpeted out as a major patron of the arts before every show! But whatever tier you choose know that this production is funded by you and for you. Art for the people, baby.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping us with our goal you'll be directly affecting the lives of 12 stellar actors in the NYC area, designers galore, not to mention providing affordable live entertainment options to the people in Midtown Manhattan since our 62 seat theatre will be mere blocks from the mammoth specticle of Broadway.</p>
<p>Most artists believe in the power of the Shakespeare's words. They are timeless and can be just as indicative of the modern world as they were when they were written but, we have to win back the trust of the people by making it accessible to their situation.</p>
<p>Our last show, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (see production photos on <a href=""http://www.eurekasuitcase.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.eurekasuitcase.org</a>), was a great success and the people that came out to see it were blown away by what we were able to achieve outside, on the side of mountain in Snowmass, CO. This time we get to bring our style to Midtown Manhattan and we couldn't be more excited.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have $1 to give then please spread the word about the campaign. The only way we will succeed is if people want to see this production. The share tools are a great resource and taking 30 seconds means that even more people have the opportunity to make this vision of THE TEMPEST a reality.</p>

We'll be posting designer art and other special things on the campaign wall as well as our facebook page, www.facebook.com/eurekasuitcase and our website www.eurekasuitcase.org. So keep checking in as you tell other people about it.
What We Need & What You Get


We need $6,000 to pay the actors and designers for the work and time they've put in and for minimalist design elements such as props and costumes. It's a BIG show and even though we're a minimalist company, it takes top notch talent to tell the story in a simple way. We believe that professionals of all kinds deserve something for their expertise.
And because we're working in collaboration with The Tank NYC, a 501c(3) organization, you're gift will be tax-dedictible!
So, take a look at our tiers, decide on what you'd like to share with us, and then look at the tier above it. Chances are you'll love that gift more! And since it's tax-deductible you can give more!
Who wouldn't want a drunk dial voicemail from the two drunken characters in the show? I know I would. Or you can make Aaron Vega's hand cramp from writing 50 personalized sonnets. Or better yet, have your name trumpeted out as a major patron of the arts before every show! But whatever tier you choose know that this production is funded by you and for you. Art for the people, baby.


The Impact
By helping us with our goal you'll be directly affecting the lives of 12 stellar actors in the NYC area, designers galore, not to mention providing affordable live entertainment options to the people in Midtown Manhattan since our 62 seat theatre will be mere blocks from the mammoth specticle of Broadway.
Most artists believe in the power of the Shakespeare's words. They are timeless and can be just as indicative of the modern world as they were when they were written but, we have to win back the trust of the people by making it accessible to their situation.
Our last show, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (see production photos on www.eurekasuitcase.org), was a great success and the people that came out to see it were blown away by what we were able to achieve outside, on the side of mountain in Snowmass, CO. This time we get to bring our style to Midtown Manhattan and we couldn't be more excited.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't have $1 to give then please spread the word about the campaign. The only way we will succeed is if people want to see this production. The share tools are a great resource and taking 30 seconds means that even more people have the opportunity to make this vision of THE TEMPEST a reality.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Fiercely contemporary, the company is driving a growing progressive performance community in Colorado, with CGP’s black-box venue <strong>work|space Denver</strong> at the center of the movement.</p>
<p>            This summer Control Group has the amazing opportunity to perform at American Dance Festival as part of the festival’s MFA performance series. The largest congregation of professional dancers, companies, teachers, and students in the country, ADF will provide an unbeatable platform for expanding CGP’s visibility, network, and activities. The company’s performances of its newest work, <em>Salon Romantik, opus 1: Wanderers in the Sea of Fog</em>, will contribute a unique physical theatre voice to ADF’s 2012 performance series, providing audiences a rare glimpse of work originating from outside of the standard cultural centers of New York and Europe.</p>
<p>            Your help couldn’t come at a better time. We’re already in the planning stages for the tour, including a generous donation from local Durham-ites of accommodations for our four-person company. Company activities from the spring will provide for modest artist fees for the dancers, who are donating their time to represent Control Group at the festival for a 10-day period. Your donations will get us the rest of the way there, paying for travel costs and materials for the performances.</p>
<p>            In return for your contributions, we’ve lined up an array of special gifts for you, our donors – everything from CGP T-shirts (new design!), DVDs of our performance work, even prints from our photo shoot with renowned Denver photographers Mark Sink and Kristen Hatgi. For business donors, we have an array of sponsorship opportunities that can highlight your business to our audiences (please inquire directly).</p>
<p>            This opportunity really is incredible! During the company’s 10 days at ADF, we’ll perform 3-4 shows at two different venues, participate in the ADF school, and network with presenters, colleagues, and other companies. The results will be far-reaching – further performance opportunities, new companies for CGP to present at our Denver theater, broader visibility for Control Group nationally and internationally, and, of course, the opportunity to share our unique and exciting work with Durham and ADF audiences.</p>

<h3>Empowering local and global artists, we provide opportunities for national and international artists to work together in an environment for growth, creativity and transformation.</h3>
<p>DAIPANbutoh Collective is devoted to strengthening the presence of Butoh in Seattle and the Northwest, both by producing the work of its members and by bringing in international artists for performances and workshops. In doing so, we aim to deeply influence our community’s evolution.</p>
<p>DAIPAN Butoh Collective is five female dancers with furious vitality, offering world class quality butoh dance to the Northwest. We don’t have the backing of a large arts organization like On The Boards and STG yet we bring the same high quality art at extremely accessible pricing to our growing community. Through our volunteer energies we have brought the finest international performers and teachers to Seattle in our annual international butoh festival.  This is our eighth year producing the Seattle Butoh Festival, which always features performances by international butoh artists and DAIPAN members. We need your help to pull this off. It costs money to fly in artists, house them and pay for them to teach and perform, not to mention the technical and production expenses.  We are grateful to have received a sustaining art grant from 4Culture, but this grant only covers a fraction of our total expenses.  This festival is our most ambitious undertaking so far - with a full gallery show, 6 gallery performance days and 3 mainstage performances involving 8 international guest artists from Chile and Helsinki.  Please help us keep Seattle the vital sanctuary of global artistry and humanity that it is!</p>
<p>DAIPANbutoh Collective’s current community includes the DAIPANbutoh ACTIVE members Sheri Brown, Joan Laage, Helen Thorsen, Diana García-Snyder, Kaoru Okumura in addition to DAIPANpartners and DAIPANfriends. We continually enlarge our community by interfacing with artists of various disciplines. Co-promoting, producing, and performing, we are a vehicle for cross-cultural exchange with artists internationally. We are reaching out as individual artists and as a group to become an integral, intelligent international presence in the evolving butoh aesthetic inside a global boom of butoh-inspired art.</p>

<p>My name is Roderick (Ricky) Woodruff. I was born and raised on the eastside of Detroit. I am a recent graduate with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Acting from Southern Methodist University, where I was awarded the engaged learning fellowship. At SMU, I was taught to be a world changer and today, I invite you to join my revolution: the New York and international premier of “A Boy’s Room.”</p>
<p>A Boy’s Room is a multimedia memory play that follows little Ricky in his bedroom, attempting to put on a one-of-a-kind performance inspired by  Beyoncé’s Formation World Tour. During his flamboyant pop performance, he is steadily interrupted by his inner demons, who constantly beg him to conform. At its core, A Boy’s Room is meant to disrupt, deconstruct, and ultimately dismantle toxic-masculinity that is generationally imposed on black boys. Through the use of a short film, creative storytelling, original music and choreography, A Boy’s Room serves as my call to action- educating the world [particularly black men] on the importance of embracing one’s whole self.</p>
<p>As a poor, black and gay man I have experienced public humiliation, doubt and self hate. I have spent most of my life in search of wholeness and self worth. More often than not, I had found myself resenting the circumstances of which I’d been placed. More so, I resented those whom I felt had placed me there. I had become insecure, to say the least. I quickly learned to wear masks to conceal the shame I felt in everyday things; my mom’s beat up 1990’s Subaru, the ebonics I grew up speaking and the Beyonce song lumped in my throat. Being a poor, black and gay boy from Detroit was a Death sentence to me. I worked hard to prove myself to my community by excelling artistically at the internationally acclaimed Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit, academically at Cass Technical High School and even beyond Detroit at Southern Methodist University and Dallas Theatre Center. I truly believed the only way to escape my circumstances was through assimilation. I yearned to be seen as a distinguished man, though it would amount to a complete loss of self identity. By senior year at SMU, I had realized that my acting techniques were great, but my work was lacking the brutal honesty that is required to make real art. It was lacking my truth. It was lacking the poor, black, gay boy I tried to erase. I began to question myself and my work. How could I be this revolutionary, transformative and inspirational artist who influences the next generation, while living a lie? The answer was simple: I couldn’t.</p>
<p>So, I wrote A Boy’s Room, not only to reconcile my relationship with self, but to also ensure that no little black boy ever thinks that assimilation is his only way out.</p>
<p>After realizing its potential, I workshopped and staged the first production in April of 2019. Despite the conservative culture at SMU, the production was well received. Each night, the show’s occupancy was at maximum capacity. The audience members were transcended. It was as if we had experienced a spiritual gathering together. It was here that I understood the potential for truly engaging, transforming and inspiring the world. I then teamed up with producer Kaylyn Buckley (SMU ‘17) and director Brandi Jaray Mcleain (SMU ‘19) to begin laying the ground work for both a New York and 2020 Edinburgh Fringe Festival debut.</p>
<p>By staging A Boy’s Room in New York City and in Scotland, our message will spread like wild fire. The New York production will help to continue building our following and will gain attraction for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival debut, where we’ll perform 28 consecutive days for thousands of individuals at the world’s largest arts festival. During each production, we will broadcast the performance and encourage the audience to post, tweet and/or live record the show to assist us in promoting our narrative,  so that the show’s targeted audience may have easy access to the performance.</p>
<p>Today, I ask you to join our movement.  A Boy's Room is a lifestyle; a relationship to a truth that is greater than just a play. It is a voice for countless young black men who cannot (or refuse) to speak his truth. It is my way of protecting, engaging, inspiring and transforming the generation that succeeds me. It is a safe space where theatre meets community and vice versa. With your help, A Boy’s Room can change lives. I am asking you to join our movement and to partner with us in saving the little black gay boy who feels inadequate and ashamed. To produce A Boy’s Room successfully, we need to raise at least $50,000. This money will be used for flights, housing, set construction, pay for our invaluable creatives, costumes, venue fees, and other crucial production expenses. Donations between $1,000 and $5,000 will be rewarded with producer credit. In addition, donations of $5,000 or more will be rewarded with an executive producer credit on the show. If you’d like to make a substantial donation that is tax-deductible, please follow this link so you can donate through our fiscal sponsorship and receive your tax write-off:  <a href=""https://fundraising.fracturedatlas.org/a-boy-s-room"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://fundraising.fracturedatlas.org/a-boy-s-...</a> </p>

<p><strong>Samantha Spriggs </strong>(she/her/hers) is an Atlanta-based independent dance-artist whose work has been presented in Chicago, New York, Dallas, and Atlanta. This will be her first self-produced work in Atlanta. In addition to her choreographic work, Spriggs has presented research at the joint Society of Dance History Scholars/Congress On Research in Dance conference and worked in technical theater as a lighting designer, stage manager, and sound designer for dance and theater. Her choreography and teaching work emphasizes the intersections between live performance and social justice.  </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Self-producing work as an independent artist can be incredibly daunting. Sources of funding are scarce, and the upfront costs of renting rehearsal space to begin exploring an idea often keeps artists from delving into the work they are driven to make. We need help to offset those upfront costs and to be able to pay the incredible cast of collaborators who have committed themselves to the creation of this work. We have been in process for this production since February, and cannot wait to share it with you. Each of us has embedded our voice, our experiences, and ourselves in this work. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>By contributing to this project, you are directly impacting the lives of the artists involved, and making the creation of new work an accessible and attainable goal. I am committed to paying my collaborators for their immeasurable contributions to the creation and content of this work, and I cannot reasonably do that without your support. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're hoping to raise $3000 with this campaign. These funds will first and foremost supplement our other funding sources to PAY THE ARTISTS. Any additional funds will be used to rent the needed lighting and production equipment, pay for space rental for rehearsal and performances, and offset the upfront costs of making work.</li>
<li>Every donor will receive our heartfelt thanks, a mention in our program and a <i>coveted</i> social media shout-out. Larger donations will receive handwritten notes, tickets to the show, and even a small handmade gift for the highest level donors!</li>
<li>If we don't fully reach our funding goal, first priority goes to performer pay, so no matter what, the artists will be compensated for their time. The more we raise, even exceeding our goal, the more performer pay will increase, but no matter what, they will receive a competitive stipend for their work.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unable to make a financial contribution right now (we're artists, we absolutely get it!), here are other ways in which you can help us reach our goal:</p>
