<p><strong>The Code Cadets are a group of Year 7 - 12 boys at Canberra Grammar School in Australia who have a (healthy) obsession with technology.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to studying IT-subjects at school (including web programming and iOS app development) the Code Cadets meet outside of normal school time to chat, network, and work on their own entrepreneurial technology-related projects (...and eat pizza...).</p>
<p>These boys are not typical teenagers who sit around playing games all day - they are interested in technology on the technical and code level. The achievements of our Code Cadets include winning <a href=""http://www2.cgs.act.edu.au/news/cgs-code-cadets-hack-to-success-at-govhack-2012"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hackathons</a> together with major <a href=""http://news.defence.gov.au/2012/07/11/australian-air-cadets-to-compete-in-the-aerospace-challenge-in-the-united-kingdom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">engineering competitions</a>.</p>
<p>The Code Cadets have mainstreamed something which was traditionally seen as geeky or nerdy, and made it extremely cool and the thing which everyone wants to do. The popularity of this trip is certainly a testament to this success.</p>
<img alt=""San Francisco map"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://site.codecadets.com/indiegogo/san-francisco-map.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><p>To allow our group to see IT on a grand scale, outside of our home city of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Canberra</a>, we are organising a trip during January and February 2013 to the birthplace of the IT boom, San Francisco, for the Macworld | iWorld 2013 Conference.</p>
<p>Additionally, many high-tech companies in Silicon Valley are kindly opening their doors to our group, allowing us to visit and speak with executives and engineers.</p>
<p>Of course, we are also going to have time for sightseeing and taking-in everything San Francisco. For some of the boys this is the first time overseas, and for almost all the boys it's their first trip to San Francisco.</p>
<p>This is truly going to be an amazing and life changing experience for the group.</p>
<p>However, we still need to get to the other side of the world (which is not a cheap proposition by any means). So...</p>

<img alt=""Your contribution will help make our trip awesome!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://site.codecadets.com/indiegogo/contribution.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Your contribution will help make our trip awesome!""/><p>As you can appreciate, we are travelling during a peak time of the year (January/February 2013) so the costs of this trip are quite expensive - around $6000 per student. Much of this expense comprises our airfares, accommodation, and transport, so any contribution that you are able to offer will benefit our group tremendously.</p>
<img alt=""Codie - The Code Cadets Mascot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://site.codecadets.com/indiegogo/codie-mascot.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><p>All contributions go directly towards the boys and reducing their costs. If you are able to contribute $100 or less then this will go towards helping to reduce our major costs mentioned above (airfares, accommodation, and transport). Remember, every little bit (regardless of amount) will help!</p>
<p>If you are able to contribute over $100 (which would be super-awesome!) you are now directly funding an activity on our trip. If you take a look at the perks on the right-hand side you will see a mapping of your contribution to a specific activity, so you can see a direct positive cause-and-effect of your contribution. We've also got some tokens of our appreciation that we would be delighted to share in recognition of your contributions.</p>
<p>Our funding goal is $10,000, as we didn't want to be unrealistically optimistic. There are 16 boys on our trip in total, so this would reduce the cost by $625 per student (given that the trip costs $6000 per student this reduction is substantial). If we don't reach our funding goal that's alright, as we can certainly use any contributed funds. However, if we go over our funding goal then we will be ecstatic, as we could certainly use the additional funds :)</p>
<p>Our group is already so excited about the trip, with comments such as...</p>

</tr></tbody></table></div>","Sixteen students. Two Weeks. One City. The journey of a lifetime...
The Code Cadets are a group of Year 7 - 12 boys at Canberra Grammar School in Australia who have a (healthy) obsession with technology.
In addition to studying IT-subjects at school (including web programming and iOS app development) the Code Cadets meet outside of normal school time to chat, network, and work on their own entrepreneurial technology-related projects (...and eat pizza...).
These boys are not typical teenagers who sit around playing games all day - they are interested in technology on the technical and code level. The achievements of our Code Cadets include winning Hackathons together with major engineering competitions.
The Code Cadets have mainstreamed something which was traditionally seen as geeky or nerdy, and made it extremely cool and the thing which everyone wants to do. The popularity of this trip is certainly a testament to this success.
To allow our group to see IT on a grand scale, outside of our home city of Canberra, we are organising a trip during January and February 2013 to the birthplace of the IT boom, San Francisco, for the Macworld | iWorld 2013 Conference.
Additionally, many high-tech companies in Silicon Valley are kindly opening their doors to our group, allowing us to visit and speak with executives and engineers.
Of course, we are also going to have time for sightseeing and taking-in everything San Francisco. For some of the boys this is the first time overseas, and for almost all the boys it's their first trip to San Francisco.
This is truly going to be an amazing and life changing experience for the group.
However, we still need to get to the other side of the world (which is not a cheap proposition by any means). So...


As you can appreciate, we are travelling during a peak time of the year (January/February 2013) so the costs of this trip are quite expensive - around $6000 per student. Much of this expense comprises our airfares, accommodation, and transport, so any contribution that you are able to offer will benefit our group tremendously.
All contributions go directly towards the boys and reducing their costs. If you are able to contribute $100 or less then this will go towards helping to reduce our major costs mentioned above (airfares, accommodation, and transport). Remember, every little bit (regardless of amount) will help!
If you are able to contribute over $100 (which would be super-awesome!) you are now directly funding an activity on our trip. If you take a look at the perks on the right-hand side you will see a mapping of your contribution to a specific activity, so you can see a direct positive cause-and-effect of your contribution. We've also got some tokens of our appreciation that we would be delighted to share in recognition of your contributions.
Our funding goal is $10,000, as we didn't want to be unrealistically optimistic. There are 16 boys on our trip in total, so this would reduce the cost by $625 per student (given that the trip costs $6000 per student this reduction is substantial). If we don't reach our funding goal that's alright, as we can certainly use any contributed funds. However, if we go over our funding goal then we will be ecstatic, as we could certainly use the additional funds :)
Our group is already so excited about the trip, with comments such as...


Your contribution will help support the future.
This is a school trip, so you can rest assured that 100% of your contribution is going towards our group and subsiding the costs of our trip. There's no middle-man taking their cut here.
So that you can see the faces of those you will be helping out, meet the Code Cadets Class of 2012 who are embarking on the big trip...

<p>Education is one of the biggest issues in our society.  Standardized test scores are extremely low.  Children are being promoted to the next grade without mastering the skills required for them to be successful in the future.  And if that isn’t bad enough, hundreds of thousands of teachers have lost their jobs over the last five years.  It is time for us to help out the public school system and the government.  It’s time we take charge as parents, aunts, cousins and friends to do whatever it takes to improve this situation.  The future seems pretty bleak… which is why we’re reaching out to you!</p>
<p>Our plan is to build an online school that will reinforce the basics that our kids need to succeed.  Our online environment will be informative, fun and an excellent supplement to what kids are learning in school.  This will also provide more of an opportunity for parents to get and stay involved in the education process.  We’ve also been personally impacted by the layoffs to educators over the past few years.  We would like to put some of these teachers back to work, so that they can do what they love and earn a little extra income at the same time.</p>
<p><strong> Next Steps?</strong></p>
<p>  With your donations we’ll be able to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Procure the hardware and bandwidth required to operate an online school.  This will be an all online school, with live video for instruction and communication between educators, parents and students</li>
<li>Work with educators to build our curriculum.  We are reaching out to current and ex K-12 teachers and administrators to work with us to develop the school policies and lessons to administer.</li>
</ul><p> In this round of funding, we are looking to raise $55000.00 USD to get the school active.  Please consider helping us in any way you can.  Please check back to this page often for updates.  You can also signup for updates by going to <a href=""http://www.lunchreadables.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lunchreadables.com</a>.</p>

<p>Everyday, millions of rebuildable computers are discarded or scrapped, and there are many people who are unable to afford these devices that will connect them to their families, communities, and services that they can use to improve their families lives</p>
<p><em>Not 4 Profit Inc provides programs to communities that are designed to reduce the digital divide in rural communities by repurposing computers from agencies, and providing them to school districts to promote academic excellence and citizenship in their community</em></p>
<p>Excellence in Education is a program founded in 2008, when it was decided to start a program of students helping students, and their communities by volunteering to repair, and rebuild computers that were donated to Not 4 Profit Inc</p>
<p>This program was inspired by our desire to assist the students and members of the community to provide refurbished computers that would enable families and students to overcome the digital divide</p>
<p><em>Excellence in Education encourages students in elementary, high school, and college to apply their energies to their scholastic endeavors, and to their community by volunteering and assisting other citizens who require a helping hand</em></p>
<p>The magic of the effects of Excellence in Education in the community has produced a positive effect for students to <strong>demonstrate the way that the next generation of youth can express and empower themselves.</strong> The cultivation of students helping students and their communities has fostered a greater sense of self-worth and confidence in the students that participate in the program</p>
<p>Since 2008, we have provided over 2000 refurbished computers to students who have excelled in their academic pursuit, and each student has made a difference by assisting others who needed a helping hand</p>
<p>Our program is being built from the ground up; and 100% of our revenue comes from people like YOU. <strong>We want this program to spread across the USA, and to repurpose refurbish the discarded computers, and to provide them to the many students who need or require them to overcome the digital divide, and we need your help!</strong></p>
<p>We know that the students who can benefit the most from this kind of experience are often those without the financial means to afford it. <strong>Your donation will mean more students can participate</strong> in this life-changing experience</p>
<p>Many communities could benefit by starting their own campaign to reuse these valuable assets, and to return it to serve those who are most in need. In 2013, it is more important than ever for students to have access to a computer to achieve academic success in their goal toward a career; and a computer opens the door to possibilities that can be achieved through education and working toward the greater good</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You can help us make it happen!</strong></p>
<p>Your donations help reduce the inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, and geographic areas of different socioeconomic and other demographic levels, and will reduce the digital divide and ensure equal access to resources that will serve all students!  </p>
<p>Helping us reach our goal of $2,500.00 will allow us to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase components for the repair of the 100 donated computers for refurbishment</li>
<li>Offer an additional 100 computers to students that participate in the Excellence in Education Program</li>
</ul><p>If we don't meet our goal, all funds received will be donated to the student campus fund or towards buying much needed supplies</p>

<p>The Excellence in Education Project school programs will give students the chance to participate fully and actively in their education.<strong> </strong> As well as a program that promotes students helping students, it is also provides a <strong>life-skills,</strong> and <strong>awareness</strong> program of the necessity to contribute to their communities through volunteering.

I don't believe he gave me an option.  As a mother I wanted to protect him and part of me had reservations about the trip.  The part of me that knew he had been called by God to go on this trip took over.  I knew the risks and death was one of them.  My son new as well, but was willing to sacrafice everything for God.  We both also knew that God is bigger than any situation and He would be his protector;  and He was.  The trip was changed due to dangerous drug cartel activity a few weeks before the departure date and was moved to south Texas.  My son came home a different person.  He continued in missions to Nicaragua that same summer and this summer of 2012 he spent two months in Honduras.

I have seen first hand how the Lord has used my son to preach, teach, and love on so many of the unloved;   the untouchables.  I have heard the stories of God multiplying food when it appeared there wouldn't be enough for those lined up in the dumpster city of Honduras for spaghetti in a styrofoam cup.  I have heard of the hopeless coming to Christ after hearing His promises.

I have felt a tugging on my heart for sometime to start moving more for the Lord.  I will never be able to ""do enough"" and I know that it why Jesus died on the cross.  I know He took it all for me and you and the people all over the world.  They need to know.  I love God with all my heart, mind, soul and strength and want nothing more than to reach those who haven't heard of His love,  His great sacrafice, and His wonderful promise to those who will call upon His name as their savior.

I can't do this alone.  I need your help.  This mission trip will cost $4000 and that includes my trip fee to Adventures in Missions(adventuresinmissions.org) my plane ticket to Kenya, and my travel vaccines. I am covering other incidentals myself.  

I also need prayer from now until a few weeks after I return.  The preparation physically, mentally and spiritually is nothing I take lightly and can use prayer.  The time I am in the mission field I ask that you pray for those hearts that will be hearing the gospel and feeling the love of Jesus.  I also ask for prayer upon my return to the states.  I watched my son's heart ache upon his return, and I know it will be a difficult time.  Please also pray for safety during travel.  I ask that you lift up Sherry McMorris as well.  She and I are going together on this trip and will need prayer as well.

Thank you so much for your financial support and your prayful support.  May God bless you.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","The fall of 2010 my sixteen-year-old son came to me and told me he was going on a mission trip to Mexico through an organization called Adventures in Missions.  I don't believe he gave me an option.  As a mother I wanted to protect him and part of me had reservations about the trip.  The part of me that knew he had been called by God to go on this trip took over.  I knew the risks and death was one of them.  My son new as well, but was willing to sacrafice everything for God.  We both also knew that God is bigger than any situation and He would be his protector;  and He was.  The trip was changed due to dangerous drug cartel activity a few weeks before the departure date and was moved to south Texas.  My son came home a different person.  He continued in missions to Nicaragua that same summer and this summer of 2012 he spent two months in Honduras.

I have seen first hand how the Lord has used my son to preach, teach, and love on so many of the unloved;   the untouchables.  I have heard the stories of God multiplying food when it appeared there wouldn't be enough for those lined up in the dumpster city of Honduras for spaghetti in a styrofoam cup.  I have heard of the hopeless coming to Christ after hearing His promises.

I have felt a tugging on my heart for sometime to start moving more for the Lord.  I will never be able to ""do enough"" and I know that it why Jesus died on the cross.  I know He took it all for me and you and the people all over the world.  They need to know.  I love God with all my heart, mind, soul and strength and want nothing more than to reach those who haven't heard of His love,  His great sacrafice, and His wonderful promise to those who will call upon His name as their savior.

<p>Hagar Vietnam would like to establish
a new computer lab to empower disadvantaged women who have survived human trafficking, sexual exploitation and domestic violence.  In the past, these disadvantaged women have had limited opportunities to
pursue their goals and dreams. This project is designed to assist Hagar's clients by enhancing their educational skills and providing them with necessary skills to increase their employment prospects.
With your help, we would like to set up a computer lab consisting of 5 individual computer stations within the Transitional Center (Residential Care Facility).  The project will provide residential clients with 24/7 access to the computer lab, enabling them to improve their English skills and allow them to pursue vocational training for alternative careers paths.  A portion of the money raised will also be used for the purchase of new educational software. This project will be implemented by the Hagar staff and IT trained volunteers through a partnership with other NGOs in Vietnam. </p>

Hagar Vietnam would like to establish
a new computer lab to empower disadvantaged women who have survived human trafficking, sexual exploitation and domestic violence.  In the past, these disadvantaged women have had limited opportunities to
pursue their goals and dreams. This project is designed to assist Hagar's clients by enhancing their educational skills and providing them with necessary skills to increase their employment prospects.
With your help, we would like to set up a computer lab consisting of 5 individual computer stations within the Transitional Center (Residential Care Facility).  The project will provide residential clients with 24/7 access to the computer lab, enabling them to improve their English skills and allow them to pursue vocational training for alternative careers paths.  A portion of the money raised will also be used for the purchase of new educational software. This project will be implemented by the Hagar staff and IT trained volunteers through a partnership with other NGOs in Vietnam. 
About Hagar VietnamEstablished in 2009, Hagar Vietnam is committed to the psychosocial recovery and economic empowerment of women who are survivors of human trafficking, sexual exploitation and domestic violence. Our organization continues to develop innovative ways to assist these women. Since 2009, over 150 women have gained autonomy and security, becoming independent contributing members of society.Hagar Vietnam provides long-term, individualized services for women, including residential and transitional care, medical support, legal aid, counseling, education, family services and economic empowerment. Although each woman’s journey is different, each is assisted with walking through the following spheres of change: protection, personal wellbeing, societal change, economic empowerment, and social capital.

<p>This Indiegogo campaign is focused on raising
money for <b><i><span>Divine
Yoga School</span></i></b>, a school that provides free education to 35 children
ages 3-12 while teaching them how to <i>Live the Essence of Yoga</i>. Right now we have one main building that serves ashram visitors and the
35 kids who eagerly come to learn six days a week. We are located in a small
town in Nepal where there are not many options for children’s education. We are
the only school that offers Yoga, Sanskrit and Music integrated into the daily
curriculum that includes Math, Science, English, Computer, etc. Our student’s parents
tell us what a remarkable difference they see in their children after coming to
our school after just one or two years. Your contributions will help ensure
that the school can be sustained and expanded so that more kids can receive the
benefits of yoga and a great education. We thought the best way to thank you is
by also giving you the gift of yoga so our perks include an autographed book
written by the Founder, Yogi Prakash, a just released Yoga DVD and even a
chance to come learn yoga in Nepal.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/280969/files/20131227150044-Dance_Music_Yoga_Ashram_Quote.JPG?1388185244"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Successes </h3><p><b></b></p>
<p><b><i>Divine Yoga School</i></b> was established in 2010 and has been financially sustained
by monies earned from residential yoga classes offered at Shanti Yoga Ashram,
donations and private loans; we do not receive government funding. For three
years we have been able to give full scholarships to 95% of the children and are
currently providing clothing, food and permanent housing to four children. We
have had a 100% pass rate each year and the oldest students (ages 11-12) are
able to lead yoga classes. The school has participated in yoga demonstrations,
music and dance performances. Perhaps our biggest success is that each day the kids arrive full of enthusiasm and leave happy. We want to expand the school and
accept all children regardless of their ability to pay, but we need your help. We
want to increase our capacity from 35 to 100 students and offer 10 residential
spaces for children in rural and under served areas of Nepal so we humbly urge
you to become a part of this project and let’s give more children the chance to
have a positive and peaceful education.</p><h3>

<p>We have
big plans but have set our campaign goal at $33,000 to ensure we meet our goal
and receive the highest percentage of funding based on Indiegogo’s campaign
rules. $33,000 allows us to implement <b>Phase
I</b> which gives 100 kids a year’s worth of education, covers all the living
expenses for 10 children residing at the ashram and includes the fees charged
for running this campaign. Ideally, we will move right into <b>Phase II</b>, constructing a new building
solely dedicated to the kids schools with dormitories for 10 children. The land,
building construction and furnishings will be $70,000 bringing our stretch goal
to a total of $100,000.  If we get to
$100,000 we can start construction on the new school building in 2014! This is
huge money in Nepal but if just <b>971
supporters contribute $35</b>, we will make our initial goal or if 1,000 people
contribute $100 we can hit our stretch goal and break ground in 2014!! </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/303575/files/20140111200722-Fundraising_Goals_NEW.JPG?1389499642"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""></span><p></p><h3>Sustainability </h3>Shanti

This Indiegogo campaign is focused on raising
money for Divine
Yoga School, a school that provides free education to 35 children
ages 3-12 while teaching them how to Live the Essence of Yoga. Right now we have one main building that serves ashram visitors and the
35 kids who eagerly come to learn six days a week. We are located in a small
town in Nepal where there are not many options for children’s education. We are
the only school that offers Yoga, Sanskrit and Music integrated into the daily
curriculum that includes Math, Science, English, Computer, etc. Our student’s parents
tell us what a remarkable difference they see in their children after coming to
our school after just one or two years. Your contributions will help ensure
that the school can be sustained and expanded so that more kids can receive the
benefits of yoga and a great education. We thought the best way to thank you is
by also giving you the gift of yoga so our perks include an autographed book
written by the Founder, Yogi Prakash, a just released Yoga DVD and even a
chance to come learn yoga in Nepal.Successes 
Divine Yoga School was established in 2010 and has been financially sustained
by monies earned from residential yoga classes offered at Shanti Yoga Ashram,
donations and private loans; we do not receive government funding. For three
years we have been able to give full scholarships to 95% of the children and are
currently providing clothing, food and permanent housing to four children. We
have had a 100% pass rate each year and the oldest students (ages 11-12) are
able to lead yoga classes. The school has participated in yoga demonstrations,
music and dance performances. Perhaps our biggest success is that each day the kids arrive full of enthusiasm and leave happy. We want to expand the school and
accept all children regardless of their ability to pay, but we need your help. We
want to increase our capacity from 35 to 100 students and offer 10 residential
spaces for children in rural and under served areas of Nepal so we humbly urge
you to become a part of this project and let’s give more children the chance to
have a positive and peaceful education.
Where Your Contributions GoFundraising Goals
We have
big plans but have set our campaign goal at $33,000 to ensure we meet our goal
and receive the highest percentage of funding based on Indiegogo’s campaign
rules. $33,000 allows us to implement Phase
I which gives 100 kids a year’s worth of education, covers all the living
expenses for 10 children residing at the ashram and includes the fees charged
for running this campaign. Ideally, we will move right into Phase II, constructing a new building
solely dedicated to the kids schools with dormitories for 10 children. The land,
building construction and furnishings will be $70,000 bringing our stretch goal
to a total of $100,000.  If we get to
$100,000 we can start construction on the new school building in 2014! This is
huge money in Nepal but if just 971
supporters contribute $35, we will make our initial goal or if 1,000 people
contribute $100 we can hit our stretch goal and break ground in 2014!! Sustainability Shanti
Yoga Ashram was established in 2001 and more than 2,000 students have benefited
from yoga classes offered by the ashram. In 2010, Shanti Yoga Ashram founded
Divine Yoga School to help preserve the knowledge of yoga by passing it on to
the next generation. For the past three
years, monies earned from Shanti Yoga Ashram have been used to create and support Divine Yoga
School. Right now, we are fundraising for the initial setup costs of a larger
children’s school. Annual costs after the fundraising year will be covered by
revenues earned from Shanti Yoga Ashram and Kathmandu Yoga College, the third
organization in the Lotus Project. Our goal is to open Kathmandu Yoga College
in 2015 and offer a one-year yoga diploma program. In 2014, we will also begin
offering a two-month intensive yoga course at Shanti Yoga Ashram, offering a

<h3>My Situation</h3>
<p>While repairing a broadcast transmitter in 1991, I received a shock of nearly 8000 volts.  It left me with a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), chronic pain, frequent severe migraine headaches, and short-term memory impairment.</p>
<p>It took almost 6 years to be diagnosed with the brain injury.  My teeth died right away and we spend about 2 years reconstructing my jaw and placing dental implants.  This was after 27 root-canal treatments that failed.  I hit a very deep depression and finally I attempted suicide to escape the physical and emotional pain.  It was right after my attempt that my TBI was diagnosed.</p>
<p>Professionals began my rehab as soon as I was stable after my attempt.  My pain is controlled now, and I believe I need to keep helping other survivors to give back much of what I've been blessed with as far as knowledge and ways to compensate.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Here's What Your Help Will Provide</h3>
<p>By making a donation, you'll help defray the cost of providing education to the public, employers and families of a TBI survivor.  You'll also be helping survivors directly through your donation, as it will allow me to continue to travel to survivors and work with them to help them achieve the independence they want and need.  We survivors merely want to live as normal life as possible.  Not only will your donation help get them the services they want and need, it will let them know others do care.  To date, I've been funding the programming and services out of my own pocket, but it's time to expand and have the ability to provide to more survivors.  In addition, we're setting up a video production studio so that we may produce high quality educational videos for TBI survivors, their families, and the general public.  These videos will be at no cost to survivors and their families.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Ultimate Goal</h3>
<p>Most survivors who are able, want to return to work and be a productive member of society.  I was encouraged to go on disability, but I'm able to work, and believe I should be self-supporting.  Most other survivors feel the same way.  Your generosity will enable me to spend more time helping others who have sustained and survived a traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, here are some ways you can be just as helpful:</p>

<li>Share my story and my campaign with as many people as possible, using Indiegogo share tools;</li>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi there, folks. My name is Yevette, and with your help, someday I will change the face of the fashion industry. </p>
<p>I am a senior at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN. I am studying entrepreneurial business, apparel design, and studio art; and this upcoming spring is my senior fashion show at St. Catherine's University. We present our own line of 7-10 full looks, each garment handmade by the designer. I take great pride in my work and hold myself to high standards: I use eco-friendly and socially responsible materials; I recycle fabrics to give them new life; and I employ as many couture techniques as possible.</p>
<p>It is not cheap to create beautiful, socially-responsible clothing, especially when you do not have the option of buying wholesale-- that's right, our whole line is out-of-pocket. One simple dress worth of fabric can be $50, easy. Furthermore, design (and college in general) has a knack for taking up your whole life, to the point where one can only work a few hours a week. Thus, here is a typical broke college kid. I am also a transfer at UST (a private institution), so all of my previous scholarships went null and they offered me nothing in return. My parents try to assist me after MN grants and scholarships, but gym teachers and woodworkers do not hold the most glamorous of jobs in today's economy. So, perhaps you see my predicament: I can barely pay for tuition and loans as is. Any contribution will help me so much-- know that you will be fostering education and creativity.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p style="""">I transferred schools very abruptly because I had a dream. I want to run a business that offers fair trade clothing in the US; that helps entire communities in the East or Africa; that gives back to those in need; and in turn, one that allows the buyer to know they have made the world a happier place while looking quite dapper.</p>
<p style="""">Please help me realize this goal. It starts with my senior line. I promise you that this line, with your contribution, will help launch me into the business and fashion world, where I will fight to make a difference.</p>
<p style="""">If I cannot find financial help to buy fabric, I will either (A) not be able to present this year; or (B) have to push myself much further into debt and not be able to create my visions. Please consider a contribution.</p>

<p>Two of my dreams are to work with ESL students and to become fluent in Spanish. Teaching with the Village Education Project in Ecuador can help me immeasurably towards my personal goals, as well as create a vibrant and enriching educational atmosphere for under-served students. I'm reaching out to my friends, family, and community for support in order to make this a reality.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF THE ORGANIZATION</strong></p>
<p>The Village Education Project is a non-profit that supports educaton for students in the highlands outside of Otavalo. Due to the high cost of schools' matriculation fees, uniforms and books, only 1 in 10 students in the impoverished rural areas receive a high school education. The Village Education Project provides full scholarships for students as well as tutoring during the school year, but this is not enough. Many are not adequately prepared to succeed in high school. That's where volunteers come in!</p>
<p><strong>VOLUNTEERS' ROLE</strong></p>
<p>Each summer, volunteers help catch the students up in the areas where they need it most: English, math, and computer skills. (I'd teach English, because I'm a big fan of the language, and because the students may surpass me in math/comp sci.) The curriculum has been prepared by Ecuadorian educators who train the volunteers and coordinate the program on the ground, so the lessons are consistent with what the students will learn when they start high school.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT THE FUNDING IS FOR</strong></p>
<p>Volunteers also help The Village Education Project fund the students' scholarships. Each volunteer is required to raise a minimum of $500, and 100% of this money goes towards paying for the students to attend high school. It costs only $200 to send one student to high school per year!</p>
<p>In addition to the $500, I need to raise money for my flight (~$1000) and living expenses (~$1000). If I can exceed my goal, I'll have more money to go towards contribution to student scholarships.</p>
<p>I'm immensely grateful for donations of any size. If you have any questions, please e-mail me at <a href=""mailto:rbranson@oberlin.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rbranson@oberlin.edu</a>. ¡Muchísimas gracias!</p>

<h3>What are our aims?</h3>
<p>Many memorial ceremonies have taken place in connection with the 80th anniversary of the seizure of power by the Nazis in Germany. Memorials have been erected, exhibitions initiated, a wide variety of information is available. These are historically and scientifically correct, but in our view the individual human fates are paid too little attention.</p>
<p>This is precisely what we want to change with our project. Getting to know the victims personally extends the historical facts to make a human experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How will we achieve this?</h3>
<p>By means of the mobile internet we want to resurrect the biographies of persecuted people directly where they happened. Personal documents such as pictures, texts or letters, any available sound or film recordings can be retrieved by smartphone or tablet computer spontaneously directly at the scene. The memories of these people could not be kept more vividly.</p>
<p>We want to show that the exclusion, arrests, deportations, and crimes did and do not take place ""somewhere"", but in our very midst. Maybe just around the corner or a few streets away. One of our central concerns is to establish this link. We want to bring the information out of books and exhibitions back into life and thus raise awareness for more tolerance in dealing with each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why do we need money?</h3>
<p>The money is to cover the costs of research, operation of the technical infrastructure (servers, software), any necessary licenses, printing of information material and communication with authorities, museums, universities and other organisations.</p>
<p>Specifically, the money should finance the first phase of the project. For the implementation of the project the agency 200grad has founded the association ""No future without a past"". We would like to begin in Berlin with its three large memorials to the victims of the Holocaust, Sinti and Roma and homosexuals. Here we want to represent as many biographies as possible at the places where the victims lived. When this aim is achieved we intend to expand our project throughout Germany and Europe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every day people still suffer discrimination, intimidation and persecution. If you take the same view as we do, that people should share knowledge and communicate in order to learn from history and to shape a better future together, then please support our project.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>We are Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority Inc.- Alpha Chapter and Sigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity Inc.- Alpha Chapter We are here to raise money for Pallium India.</p>
<p>Pallium India is a nonprofit organization aimed at helping men and women in India of all ages in their fight against terminal illness, disabilities, chronic diseases, etc.</p>
<p>This past winter, two of our members had the opportunity to travel abroad and work with Pallium India. These two members were amazed and touched by the incredible work that Pallium India does with their patients. Pallium India goes above and beyond what we, in the U.S., expect from palliative and hospice care. Pallium India has helped patients and their families build new homes, start small businesses, and even provide children with scholarships to put them through school and college.</p>
<p>Following is a letter that one of our members had written describing their experience working with Pallium India:</p>
<p><em>""India was an amazing and eye opening journey where I met so many loving, caring, and hard working people. There are no words to describe the experience I had in India...it's definitely a whole other world over there. My mom had told me that India can be the most beautiful place you've ever been as well as the ugliest. I saw both sides and she was right. The people, I would say, were the most beautiful part of India. I have never felt so welcomed and appreciated. </em><br/><em>     The organization we were working with is called Pallium India. Pallium is a nationally registered charitable trust created to fight for the needs of people who need hospice and palliative care. The doctors, nurses, and social workers that work for Pallium are by far the most dedicated and passionate team of people I have ever met. These beautiful people have dedicated their lives to giving a voice to people who haven't been heard before. Pallium India goes above and beyond what palliative and hospice care does here in the U.S. An example being that when a man had tongue cancer (keep in mind it was so severe that he could no longer swallow) and all he had for a home were stones for tables and leaves for beds, Pallium India built them a home and even gave the family chickens so they could start their own small business. </em><br/><em>     Pallium India and the people who work for the organization touched me in a way I didn't think possible. I knew the experience would be impacting, but I didn't realize just how much this organization would touch me. </em><br/><em>     Thank you again for helping me! You all were very much a part of my experience there and have already helped Pallium India by sending me there to help them for the weeks I was there. I will continue to pursue my education and strive to do what Pallium India does everyday; fight for those who feel don't have a voice and help as many people as I can.""</em></p></div>","Quick Facts:

You all were very much a part of my experience there and have already helped Pallium India by sending me there to help them for the weeks I was there. I will continue to pursue my education and strive to do what Pallium India does everyday; fight for those who feel don't have a voice and help as many people as I can.""",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Gabriella was in the process of applying to Texas A&amp;M, majoring 
in Marine Biology.  That is why I had felt moved to start a memorial 
scholarship in her honor here.  Her life was cut short, and I know she 
would be proud knowing we are going to help others, in her honor, 
fulfill their dreams.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have started an endowment with the Texas A&amp;M Foundation.  This 
endowment will help allow students like Gabriella, who love and are 
passionate about the ocean and marine life, get the education necessary 
to work in the Marine Biology field.  The funds I will raise will go 
toward this commitment ($25,000). That amount is the contract amount I 
had pledged to raise.  However, personally, I have a goal of raising 
$100,000.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This endowment, <strong>THE GABRIELLA JEANNE MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP</strong>
 will remain at the university, for the life of the university.  Her 
spirit, her memory, her passion, and all that we put into this will 
never end.  We will be impacting so many lives, and quite honestly, all 
because of the LOVE I have for my daughter.  I want something GREAT to 
come from all this pain and loss.  We miss her so much, but I know her 
LOVE and PASSION remains!  Thatâ€™s awesome!</p>

On July 18, 2011 my only child, Gabriella Jeanne, was tragically killed in an auto accident.  It was 3 weeks before her 17th birthday!

I wanted to honor her by creating this fund to support interests she 
was passionate about.   Marine biology and shark conservation were some 
of her interests.

Gabriella was in the process of applying to Texas A&M, majoring 
in Marine Biology.  That is why I had felt moved to start a memorial 
scholarship in her honor here.  Her life was cut short, and I know she 
would be proud knowing we are going to help others, in her honor,

I have started an endowment with the Texas A&M Foundation.  This

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Axis has been equipping communities to move from apathy to compassionate action since 2006. Over the past 6  years, we have challenged over 40,000 people at over 200 venues to set aside their distractions and make a real difference in the world. We are launching an exciting new 1,000-Day Plan to reach more people and help them grow deeper in their faith. In a couple of weeks, we will be having a banquet to launch this new plan. This $2,000 will go directly toward paying for the banquet, and will allow for 100% of all money raised at the banquet to go directly to Axis. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By being a part of this banquet, you are helping us reach more people than ever before. Over this past year, we have seen: a mom reunited with her son; a junior-high class student government lead well by examining their own music choices and challenging the underclassmen to follow their example; and students come to know Jesus as their Savior. Your financial support allows us to not only continue our ministry, but also to expand and see more stories like this happen every day. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>By helping us cover the cost of the banquet, you are allowing us to offer the dinner free of charge to participants. Each participant will then have the opportunity to invest in Axis' new 1,000-Day Plan. This new strategy includes reaching out to parents more than we ever have before, while expanding our ministry directly to students. The big goals of our 1,000-Day Plan include creating effective follow-up tools for communities to grow deeper in their relationship with Christ, as well as ways for Axis to become financially sustainable as an organization. We believe God has given us a vision for making a difference in the world, and by donating now, you can join us in accomplishing this exciting mission.<br/></p>

Throughout my life, my mother has had to fight to get an education for me and for my twin sister Alba, who is also significantly disabled with cerebral palsy. The greatest battle was with the public schools, where we fought to attend regular classes rather than be relegated to special education classes, which at that time amounted to little more than warehousing for students with special needs.     </span></p>

In New York City, Medicaid pays for my aide full time, even if I sit home watching television all day.  Through a Medicaid waiver, I was able to provide funding for an aide to help me during my time at Georgetown University. However, the story changes when financing is needed to support an aide during study overseas.  Medicaid will no longer fund any student's aide outside of New York.</span></p>

Following my acceptance by LSE, we worked closely with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on securing a waiver that would enable my aide to accompany me to London. But just two days before our flight to Heathrow, we received a call denying us that waiver.   </span></p>

An emeritus member of the Board of Governors became involved in helping me with the school administration to effect some important changes, which hopefully will be in place when I return in September 2012. One of the things that made my situation worse then it already was involved the accessibility of the LSE residence. It was impossible for me to get to my room independently. I had to go through three large fire doors that I could not open on my own. The door to my own room was not accessible. In actual fact, the entire room was not accessible.</p>

My mother and I continue our work together on legislation that will enable students with any disability that necessitates personal-care assistance to take their aide with them if they are enrolled at an institution of higher education. Long-term, this legislation will help people with disabilities to reach their maximum potential and have a better shot at becoming employed. It will also get them off social services and help them to become independent and enjoy a better quality of life.</p>

My name is Anastasia Somoza and I am 28 years old and living in New York City.  Since graduating from Georgetown University with a BA in Government, I have been unable to find a job outside of unpaid internships.  An extraordinary opportunity is paving the way for me to enjoy a productive and exciting career. This past spring, I received a full scholarship to read for my master's degree in human rights at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). 
 
This is the second round of funding for my campaign to fund 4 community service volunteers to help me complete a masters degree at the London School of Economics.   Thanks to the wonderful family, friends, and well wishers, we raised $21, 174 - not our $30,000 goal, but great all the same.  After deductions, $18,607 will go into my account towards payment for my aides.    
 
Here's a little background. Throughout my life, my mother has had to fight to get an education for me and for my twin sister Alba, who is also significantly disabled with cerebral palsy. The greatest battle was with the public schools, where we fought to attend regular classes rather than be relegated to special education classes, which at that time amounted to little more than warehousing for students with special needs.     
 
This is the status quo. In New York City, Medicaid pays for my aide full time, even if I sit home watching television all day.  Through a Medicaid waiver, I was able to provide funding for an aide to help me during my time at Georgetown University. However, the story changes when financing is needed to support an aide during study overseas.  Medicaid will no longer fund any student's aide outside of New York.
 
Since last year, my mother and I have worked on legislation that would allow students accepted by an institution of higher learning to take their aide with them while in school. Following my acceptance by LSE, we worked closely with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on securing a waiver that would enable my aide to accompany me to London. But just two days before our flight to Heathrow, we received a call denying us that waiver.   
 
We went to London anyway, tried and failed to secure funding, and at the 11th hour a friend offered to fund an aide for two months while we tried to fundraise.   An aide came to help me, but it did not work out and she returned abruptly to the U.S.   I had no choice but to come back, seek a deferment of my scholarship, and continue with the fundraising so I may return in September 2012.
 
While I was devastated to have to leave LSE, something wonderful resulted from all the bad things that happened. An emeritus member of the Board of Governors became involved in helping me with the school administration to effect some important changes, which hopefully will be in place when I return in September 2012. One of the things that made my situation worse then it already was involved the accessibility of the LSE residence. It was impossible for me to get to my room independently. I had to go through three large fire doors that I could not open on my own. The door to my own room was not accessible. In actual fact, the entire room was not accessible.
 
The meeting was great!  The LSE agreed to make significant accessibility changes to their residences, fund a room for my aides, and work with SCOPE (England's equivalent to United Cerebral Palsy) to make the LSE fully accessible to the extent possible for all students with disabilities.
 
I am hoping that you will all help me to get the word out about our cause in any way you can. I will keep you all updated on how we are doing via the website. Thank you for believing in me, thank you for all your efforts in helping me to achieve my goal. I look at this bad episode as a lesson in life, to overcome adversity, and to never give up no matter what the odds.
 
Please understand that this is a situation where every little bit really will help! I shall be sincerely grateful for any financial assistance from friends, family, and members of the public. From my end, I pledge to be a dedicated and hardworking student, and, as a graduate, to go out into the world at large and help improve conditions for others like myself.
 
The Impact
It's my firm belief that the impact of our campaign will lead to an awareness of the obstacles that people with disabilities face when trying to access higher education. If any non-disabled student received the type of wonderful scholarship opportunity that I have, he/she would not have to decline the offer because of the need for a personal-care aide. My mother and I continue our work together on legislation that will enable students with any disability that necessitates personal-care assistance to take their aide with them if they are enrolled at an institution of higher education. Long-term, this legislation will help people with disabilities to reach their maximum potential and have a better shot at becoming employed. It will also get them off social services and help them to become independent and enjoy a better quality of life.
What We Need & What You Get
 We do need to continue raising funds to cover the approximate cost of funding 4 community volunteers to assist me.   The cost is $10,000 a year per volunteer.   British law only allows the volunteers to work a certain number of hours per week, so for the right coverage, we need to have 4 volunteers.   As it is so costly, we are probably going to have more the two campaigns in order to raise enough money.  At $40,000 a year, the total we need for the two years is $80,000.   
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Donations from friends, family, associates and the public at large will, of course, be the greatest help. Additionally, I ask each of you to become an ambassador for my campaign. Please spread the word among your own circle of friends and contacts through Facebook and other social-media channels. This will rapidly build awareness, and will truly help me reach my fundraising goal. And of course, outreach to local media contacts you may have can also help tremendously in getting the message out.  We are also looking into the possibility of a corporate sponsor funding one community service volunteer.  I feel it will not be so onerous to fund $10,000 for one volunteer as opposed to funding the whole amount.  So, if you have any contacts or know of corporations that provide grants to people with disabilities, please let us know.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>In 2008 the Glass Student House was
organized for the first time. Due to its success it was organized it again in
2009. 2010 was the year of making changes: the house was replaced by a bus.
Now, in 2013, we take this project to a whole new level. With a bus and a
mobile studio on five different locations, a team of students will produce 121
hours of live non-stop radio for this project. The following five locations are
the locations we are going to visit: The Hague, Delft, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and
Haarlem. However, in order to do this, we need support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, organizing the Glass Student
Bus is not cheap. With the use of crowd funding we try to cover as much of the
costs as we can. Our goal is at this page, but we want to raise as much money
as we can because the more money we raise, the more we can donate to the Red
Cross!</p>
<p>Large donations will receive a special place
on our Social Media pages; imagine your name on our Twitter page, Facebook page
and website. When you donate €1.000, €2.500 or €5.000, we will offer you one of
our sponsor packages. With every donation, you may request a song which we will
play, guaranteed! </p>

<p>In 2008 werd
voor het eerst het Glazen Studentenhuis georganiseerd. Door het succes daarvan
werd dit in 2009 ook gedaan. In 2010 werd het roer omgegooid en veranderde het
huis in een bus. Nu, in 2013, pakken we het grootser aan dan ooit. Met een bus en
een mobiele studio op vijf verschillende locaties, zal een team van studenten
121 uur live non-stop radio maken voor deze actie. De vijf locaties die wij bezoeken zijn Den Haag, Delft,
Rotterdam, Amsterdam en Haarlem. Maar daar hebben wij steun bij nodig.</p>
<p>Helaas is het organiseren van de Glazen Studentenbus niet goedkoop.
Door middel van crowdfunding proberen wij zo veel mogelijk van deze kosten te
dekken. Ons doel staat hier op de pagina, maar in principe willen wij zoveel
mogelijk geld ophalen. Maar, hoe meer er gedoneerd wordt, hoe meer wij kunnen
betekenen voor het Rode Kruis!</p>
<p>Grote donaties noemen wij uiteraard op onze sociale media, denk
hierbij aan Twitter, Facebook en onze website. Bij donaties van €1.000, €2.500
en €5.000 worden er sponsorpakketten aangeboden. Bij iedere donatie mag er een
aanvraag gedaan worden voor een liedje, deze wordt gegarandeerd gedraaid.</p>

<p>The Glass Student Buss is an important event for the Red Cross. Last year we collected 12 505€ with 100 hours of radio. In 2011 we collected 6 959€. We would really like to continue this upwards line and this year collect even more money. Every year a cheque is given to the Glass House of 3FM. They also call us ""The pre-program for the Glass House"", because we are busy from December 8th till December 13th. They begin on December 18th. The big difference between the Glass House and the Glass Student Buss is that the Glass Student Buss is organized by students. We get the change to create unique experiences with the support of companies and donors.<br/></p>

vanaf 8 december bezig zijn tot en met 13 december. Zij beginnen op 18

organized for the first time. Due to its success it was organized it again in
2009. 2010 was the year of making changes: the house was replaced by a bus.
Now, in 2013, we take this project to a whole new level. With a bus and a
mobile studio on five different locations, a team of students will produce 121
hours of live non-stop radio for this project. The following five locations are
the locations we are going to visit: The Hague, Delft, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and
Haarlem. However, in order to do this, we need support.
Unfortunately, organizing the Glass Student
Bus is not cheap. With the use of crowd funding we try to cover as much of the
costs as we can. Our goal is at this page, but we want to raise as much money
as we can because the more money we raise, the more we can donate to the Red
Cross!
Large donations will receive a special place
on our Social Media pages; imagine your name on our Twitter page, Facebook page
and website. When you donate €1.000, €2.500 or €5.000, we will offer you one of
our sponsor packages. With every donation, you may request a song which we will
play, guaranteed! 
Do you want to participate in this project
and create brand awareness at unique target group? Do not hesitate, donate and
share our action! 




In 2008 werd
voor het eerst het Glazen Studentenhuis georganiseerd. Door het succes daarvan
werd dit in 2009 ook gedaan. In 2010 werd het roer omgegooid en veranderde het
huis in een bus. Nu, in 2013, pakken we het grootser aan dan ooit. Met een bus en
een mobiele studio op vijf verschillende locaties, zal een team van studenten
121 uur live non-stop radio maken voor deze actie. De vijf locaties die wij bezoeken zijn Den Haag, Delft,
Rotterdam, Amsterdam en Haarlem. Maar daar hebben wij steun bij nodig.
Helaas is het organiseren van de Glazen Studentenbus niet goedkoop.
Door middel van crowdfunding proberen wij zo veel mogelijk van deze kosten te
dekken. Ons doel staat hier op de pagina, maar in principe willen wij zoveel
mogelijk geld ophalen. Maar, hoe meer er gedoneerd wordt, hoe meer wij kunnen
betekenen voor het Rode Kruis!
Grote donaties noemen wij uiteraard op onze sociale media, denk
hierbij aan Twitter, Facebook en onze website. Bij donaties van €1.000, €2.500
en €5.000 worden er sponsorpakketten aangeboden. Bij iedere donatie mag er een
aanvraag gedaan worden voor een liedje, deze wordt gegarandeerd gedraaid.
Wilt u meehelpen aan dit project en een stukje naamsbekendheid
genereren? Aarzel dan niet, doneer en deel onze actie!
 




                            




When you donate €1.000, €2.500 or €5.000, we
will offer you one of our sponsor packages. We will discuss this with you, in
terms of what kind of advertisements you want. Do you want to participate in
this project and create brand awareness at unique target group? Do not
hesitate, donate and share our action! 
When you make a donation for the Glass Student Bus, you are not only
helping us, you are helping children in third world countries. These children
have to deal with poor hygiene and are very vulnerable for potentially deadly
diseases, like diarrhea. With your donation, you can help stop this.
We understand that you cannot always make a donation. In that case, we
would really appreciate it if you follow us on Twitter and like our Facebook
page. Please re-tweet and share our messages! If you do this, you show to your
friends and followers that you support our action and you are asking them to do
the same.

                                


Bij donaties van €1.000, €2.500 en €5.000 worden er sponsorpakketten
aangeboden. Dit zullen wij dan uitgebreid bespreken met u. Wilt u meehelpen aan
dit project en een stukje naamsbekendheid genereren? Aarzel dan niet, doneer en
deel onze actie!
Als u doneert
aan de Glazen Studentenbus, helpt u niet alleen ons, maar u helpt ook mee aan
de vermindering van kindersterfte door diarree. Dit zijn vooral kinderen in
derde wereldlanden. Deze kinderen hebben te maken met slechte hygiëne, waardoor
zij sneller ziektes oplopen die hen het leven kosten. Met uw donatie maakt u
hier dus een einde aan.
Nu kan het
altijd voor komen dat u niet kan doneren. In dat geval helpt u ons al door ons

Hiermee laat u zien dat u ons steunt en roept u uw vrienden en volgers op om

</h3><p>Access to
affordable and relevant comprehensive health education are fundamental human rights but gender-based discrimination,
lack of access to education, poverty, and violence against women and girls can
all prevent these rights from being realized. Single mums and girls face a lot
challenges when it comes to sexual reproductive health rights and basic computer skills.

</p><p>According to
the Demographic Health Surveys (2011), it has been revealed that, 21 percent of
women and girls have experienced both physical and sexual violence. Though a
lot of sensitization has been done to educate women and girls on their
rights, there continues to be many cases of violence which are not reported,
and therefore, statistics are lower in Cameroonian communities. The Cases of
gender-based violence are rampant in Cameroon but only 30 percent of such cases
are addressed by the courts. This is because about 60 percent of women and
girls are computer literates.</p>
<p>Mother of
Hope Cameroon (MOHCAM) in her fight to educate single mums and girls is
organizing a three days digital empowerment workshop in the summer to 
fight against teenage pregnancies and to equip single mums and 
adolescences on their sexual reproductive health rights and basic
computer skills. They will be given the chance to learn leadership 
skills,
build self-confidence and to better understand new marketable skills 
when using
visual training tools. This
campaign is aimed at challenging prevalent gender stereotypes in 
communities,
particularly those that reduce the aspirations of girls in rural 
communities,
where traditions are firmest and patriarchal systems still remain very 
strong. For
single mums and girls to fully participate in their communities and 
enjoy their
rights, they need a life free from gender-based discrimination- a life 
with the
opportunity to be educated, to work, to be healthy and to participate in
 all
aspects of public life. However, millions women and girls are frequently
beaten, raped, mutilated, killed and subjected to gender violence which 
limits
their opportunities.</p> <h3>What We Need  </h3><p>Our ongoing
campaign is working to connect women and girls who are victims of 
teenage
Pregnancies from the rural and underprivileged communities to Virtual 
Learning Tools. Most of them
who are single mums and girls  have never had basic skills in 
information communication technology due to poverty. If given the 
opportunity, this
will opens doors for them to share information and build like-minded 
ventures
networks. Most rural single mums and girls who are engaged in farming 
and
petite trading will acquire computer skills which will enable them to 
market
their products. They will be able meet with other women and mentors who 
will
direct them in their activities and businesses.</p><p>MOHCAM 
needs $1000 to organize a workshop for three days on sexual reproductive
 health education and basic computer skills. And $500 to purchase 
Internet-capable
phones  for 30 industrious single mums and girls in the rural 
communities of Ntasen and Mubang.</p><p>There are
plenty of steps we can take to strengthen our future, but first we need to take
action. We shall be grateful if you would donate  for Internet-capable
phones, computers or electronic gadgets to help single mums and girls to learn and even own computers. </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>When
Cameroon’s women and girls succeed, Cameroon succeeds!</p>
<p>Women and
girls in Cameroon make up more than half of the population. They are the
breadwinners and the backbone of our economy, yet they still face harsh
treatment due to outdated customs and traditions which hold them back. They are
still regarded as their husband’s property, with limited rights in most
communities. This workshop will enable them to become local community reporters
who can share information and advocate for women’s rights and positive change
for everyone.</p>
<p>Equipped
with basic computer skills, like-minded people can come together to improve
their skills and share their experiences. This will increase productivity and
encourage innovation in their businesses and workplace. Togetherness and love
will be fostered in young minds, who will then be positioned for the mentoring
and training which will enable them to create and contribute to a better
economic system in Cameroon.</p><p>Most of the girls will become local communicators for victims of 
violence who can't speak out for the fear of stigmatization in their 
communities.</p><p>1) Many sign mum will be encourage to go back to school.</p>2) The rate of early teenage pregnancies will reduced and more girls moving to leadership positions.<br/>
<p>3) Computers
are tools needed by all women and girls for a rapid change! You Can Help!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>To enable
these positive improvements in our communities, MOHCAM is faced with the
 challenge to empower 30 single mums and girls out of the thousands of 
women and girls who are interested in getting the training from Mubang 
Ntsen Nkwen village. This
workshop will take place in Foncha-street Nkwen-Bamenda from the 
28th–30th of
July 2014 at the Ets.ALMA Cybercafé opposite Providence Clinic due to 
the lack of electricity and adequate computers.

</p><p>We intend to
extend this training to fresh women and girls entering just universities. Due
to the limited Internet access, high school students entering universities in
Cameroon are not familiar with the Internet’s power use for research in their
studies. Those who go on-line simply use it to send or read emails and chat. These
women and girls lack the basic skills to access the vast learning materials
available on-line.</p> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>• 
Donate used Internet-capable
phones, computers or electronic gadgets to help single mums and girls to learn and even own computers.</p><p>• 
Use the Indiegogo share tools to
promote the project on your web sites and social networks. Invite your family
and friends to support the project.</p>
<p>•

with basic computer skills, like-minded people can come together to improve
their skills and share their experiences. This will increase productivity and
encourage innovation in their businesses and workplace. Togetherness and love
will be fostered in young minds, who will then be positioned for the mentoring
and training which will enable them to create and contribute to a better
economic system in Cameroon.Most of the girls will become local communicators for victims of 
violence who can't speak out for the fear of stigmatization in their 
communities.1) Many sign mum will be encourage to go back to school.2) The rate of early teenage pregnancies will reduced and more girls moving to leadership positions.
3) Computers
are tools needed by all women and girls for a rapid change! You Can Help!
Risks & Challenges To enable
these positive improvements in our communities, MOHCAM is faced with the
 challenge to empower 30 single mums and girls out of the thousands of 
women and girls who are interested in getting the training from Mubang 
Ntsen Nkwen village. This
workshop will take place in Foncha-street Nkwen-Bamenda from the 
28th–30th of
July 2014 at the Ets.ALMA Cybercafé opposite Providence Clinic due to 
the lack of electricity and adequate computers.

We intend to
extend this training to fresh women and girls entering just universities. Due
to the limited Internet access, high school students entering universities in
Cameroon are not familiar with the Internet’s power use for research in their
studies. Those who go on-line simply use it to send or read emails and chat. These
women and girls lack the basic skills to access the vast learning materials
available on-line. Other Ways You Can Help• 
Donate used Internet-capable
phones, computers or electronic gadgets to help single mums and girls to learn and even own computers.• 
Use the Indiegogo share tools to
promote the project on your web sites and social networks. Invite your family
and friends to support the project.
• 
Connect us with any foundation that
gives in-kind support to charities in Cameroon
•

need if they authorize it at all. A lot of people buy US currency in the black market, but at a cost over 6 times higher per dollar.

Let me tell you a little bit about Teung Sela. Teung Sela is a girl who currently lives by herself in my office in Phnom Penh. Her family farms a small plot of land far away in Siem Reap province. <br/><br/>Sela is a really kind girl and we've hung out and watched youtube videos together. Everyone around the office has really taken a liking to her and is vested in making sure she's okay and taken care of. Even though she hasn't had enough food for a while she was generous enough to cook for me and share what little food she had when I first got here and was struggling to eat and while I was sick with rheumatic fever.<br/><br/> Sela comes from a poor farming family that lives many miles away that can’t afford to send her to college.  Her dream is to one day go to law school so that she can help fight 
corruption in Cambodia (which is really, really bad). But, as it 
currently stands there’s no way she’s going to be able to get the money 
to go to school for the $570 a year it costs. It's heartbreaking because I know 
that Sela really wants to go to college and I know if she did she’d 
spend her life trying to help people.<br/><br/>Her sister used to work for my NGO so as a favor to her everyone here at my office has worked to help put up Sela and give her a place to stay while she goes to high school. Her sister gave her $1000 before she left the country to help pay for her high school fees and food but as the end of high school approaches for Sela she's beginning to realize that she's not going to have enough money to go to university. Sela had actually started budgeting herself to 5000 Cambodian riels a day of food (around $1.25) to help save money to pay for college. Even in Cambodia $1.25 a day is no where near enough to provide proper meals so after having caught wind my country director has been paying for her meals while she stays with us because she had been essentially starving herself for weeks. Unfortunately, even paying for Sela's meals is not enough to help her save the money she needs to go to school. This is where you come in.<br/><p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Numbers<br/>
</h3> <ul>
<li>It costs around $570 a year to send Sela to university<br/>
</li> <li>It costs around $80 a month to rent a nice apartment in Phnom Penh<br/>
</li> <li>It also costs money for Sela to eat and get books for school</li>
</ul><p>This means that Sela is going to need upwards of $3000 dollars to make her dream of getting an education a reality.<br/></p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Here's exactly what I'm going to do. I currently have exactly $1949.57 in my bank account. I use my money to buy food and pay for medical bills while I'm volunteering in Cambodia. On the day I leave Cambodia (August 26th) I will give the entirety of my bank account along with whatever money is raised here to Sela along with any encouraging messages anyone wants me to pass to Sela.</p><p>I was given a real gift to be able to come to Cambodia and help people. A lot of people can't afford the airfare or for whatever reason can't make it out to parts of the world where people most need help. Most people from poor farming families in Cambodia don't get to go to school. If Sela doesn't get this money she can't go to school and will never be given a chance to make it out of the tiny village she comes from. This is an investment that will change someone's quality of life forever.<br/></p><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks<br/>
</h3>If Sela doesn't get enough money then she can't go to school.

<h2><span lang=""FR"" style="""">The Young Feminists' Camp</span></h2>
<p><span lang=""FR"" style="""">The Young Feminists' Camp is an initiative born out of the European coordination of the World March of Women, a global movement connecting grassroots groups and organizations to fight patriarchy, exploitation and gender violence faced by women in the world. The idea of the camp is to build a network and solidarity among different women and feminists in Europe and globally in order to make our fight stronger and more sustainable.</span></p>
<p><span lang=""FR"" style="""">We started out with our first camp in 2011 in Toulouse, France where approximately 70 young feminists from France, Romania, Switzerland, Armenia, Germany, Basque Country, Belgium, Macedonia, Portugal, Poland and other countries in Europe attended. The aim of this camp was to make connections with women sharing similar struggles and to become stronger in uniting those struggles. In addition to many helpful workshops to learn about women's situations in different countries as well as learning various skills and tools to help us in the women's movements of our individual countries, we also had a demonstration in downtown Toulouse. We gave voice to the different struggles we work in our lives including abortion rights, austerity, violence against women, racism, homo-lesbo-transphobia, climate change, and so on.</span></p>

The Young Feminists' Camp
The Young Feminists' Camp is an initiative born out of the European coordination of the World March of Women, a global movement connecting grassroots groups and organizations to fight patriarchy, exploitation and gender violence faced by women in the world. The idea of the camp is to build a network and solidarity among different women and feminists in Europe and globally in order to make our fight stronger and more sustainable.
We started out with our first camp in 2011 in Toulouse, France where approximately 70 young feminists from France, Romania, Switzerland, Armenia, Germany, Basque Country, Belgium, Macedonia, Portugal, Poland and other countries in Europe attended. The aim of this camp was to make connections with women sharing similar struggles and to become stronger in uniting those struggles. In addition to many helpful workshops to learn about women's situations in different countries as well as learning various skills and tools to help us in the women's movements of our individual countries, we also had a demonstration in downtown Toulouse. We gave voice to the different struggles we work in our lives including abortion rights, austerity, violence against women, racism, homo-lesbo-transphobia, climate change, and so on.
We met again in Romania in 2012 for the second Young Feminists' Camp with a more expanded network including women from Chile, Brazil, Turkey and several European feminists joining for the first time. Once again we had a successful camp, which led to a number of future collective actions and projects. You can visit our blog to find out more: http://youngfeministcamp.wordpress.com/
Our network has grown and expanded since our first camp in 2011 and we want to grow more. We need your help to meet once again this year in August. This time we will be meeting in Portugal, where the troika – the alliance composed by the IMF, European Comission and European Central Bank - together with the national government that supports its politics have been devastating the country for the past two years. 
This year we would like to continue expanding by including more eastern European countries such as Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, etc. as well as to invite women from the Philippines, Tunisia, and Kenya. We believe that it is important to connect women across difficult political and cultural boundaries in order to break those that have been built within each of us to keep us down and divided.
Unemployment, precariousness and poverty has been growing and mortgaging the lives of most people, including thousands of women. The right to health and sexual and reproductive rights are increasingly becoming a mirage for many of us. In the last ten years Portugal was one of the only European countries to see the wage gap between men and women increase. Gender based violence has also been growing and intensifying.

Gostaríamos de, este ano, poder continuar a expandir a nossa rede incluindopaíses do leste da Europa, tais como a Bósnia Herzegovina, a Croácia, a Bulgária e o Montenegro, entre outros, convidando, também, mulheres das Filipinas, Tunísia e Quénia. Acreditamos que é importante conectar mulheres entre fronteiras políticas e culturais de modo a quebrar as barreiras, construídas dentro de cada uma de nós, que nos mantêm passivas e divididas.
O desemprego, a precariedade e a pobreza têm vindo a crescer, hipotecando as vidas da maior parte da população, incluindo milhares de mulheres. O direito à saúde e os direitos sexuais e reprodutivos vão-se gradualmente tornando uma miragem para muitas de nós. Nos últimos 10 anosPortugal foi um dos únicos países europeus que viu a diferença de salários entre homens e mulheres aumentar. A violência de género também tem vindo a crescer e intensificar-se.
Enquanto que, nos anos anteriores, obtivemos financiamento da União Europeia para a realização do acampamento,através do programa Juventude em Acção, é ainda incertose conseguiremoseste apoio para este ano. Sentimos que este acampamento tem sido crucial nas nossas vidas enquanto mulheres que lutam para pôr fim à violência e à injustiça nas nossas vidas individuais, nas nossas comunidades e nos nossos países. Através do Acampamento de Jovens Feministas dos últimos dois anos reafirmamos as nossas lutas, fortalecemo-nos e conectamo-nos com as lutas de outras mulheres. E acreditamos que é importante continuarmos a encontrar-nos, a partilhar ideias e lutas, sucessos e derrotas, a estabelecer conversas difíceis, a quebrar estereótipos e a colaborar para fazer o mundo avançar, empoderando todas as mulheres.
A tua contribuição irá permitir-nos encontrarmo-nos em Agosto e continuar a construir este movimento. Ao fazer um donativo estarás também a participar deste movimento que luta pelo fim da violência, da pobreza, do racismo, da homo-lesbo-transfobia e de todas as injustiças sofridas pelas mulheres nos nossos países. Se alcançarmos a nossa meta, ser-nos-à possível convidar mulheres de outros países fora da Europa para, assim, juntarmos as nossas lutas colectivas, tornando-as ainda mais fortes na sua unidade. Se não conseguirmos o nosso objectivo:
7 000€ Acampamento para 30 pessoas sem  financiamento de viagens.
10 000€ - Acampamento  para 60 pessoas.sem financiamento de viagens
15 000€ - Acampamento para 60 pessoas com financiamento  de algumas viagens
25 000€ - Acampamento para 60 pessoas com financiamento de 70% de todas as viagens.
 
 Le Campement de Jeunes Féministes
 
Le Campement de Jeunes Féministes est une initiative de la Coordination européenne de la Marche Mondiale des Femmes, un mouvement social mondial qui rassemble des groupes de femmes de la base, pour lutter contre le patriarcat, l’exploitation et les violences subies par les femmes dans le monde. L’idée du campement est de construire un réseau et de la solidarité entre jeunes femmes féministes d’Europe  et globalement pour rendre notre combat plus fort et durable.
Nous avons commencé avec le 1er campement en 2011 près de Toulouse en France, où environ 70 jeunes féministes de France, Roumanie, Suisse, Arménie, Allemagne, Pays Basque, Belgique, Macédoine, Portugal, Pologne et d’autres pays d’Europe ont participé. Le but du campement était de se rencontrer avec des jeunes femmes partageant les mêmes luttes et pour être plus fortes en unissant ces luttes. Il y a eu de nombreux ateliers autour de la situation des femmes dans les différents pays et permettant d’apprendre différents outils et techniques pour nous aider dans les mouvements de femmes. Nous avons aussi fait une manifestation dans la ville de Toulouse et rédigé un Manifeste commun. Nous avons donné de la voix à différentes luttes dans lesquelles nous sommes engagées comme le droit à l’avortement, contre l’austérité, les violences contre les femmes, le racisme, l’homo-lesbo-transphobie, le changement climatique, etc.
On s’est retrouvées en 2012 en Roumanie pour le deuxième Campement de Jeunes Féministes d’Europe avec un plus grand réseau incluant des femmes du Chili, du Brésil, de Turquie et de nombreuses féministes d’Europe venant pour la 1ère fois. De nouveau nous avons eu un super campement, qui nous a amené à plusieurs projets et actions collectives. Vous pouvez en savoir plus sur notre blog : http://youngfeministcamp.wordpress.com/
Notre réseau a grandi et s’est développé depuis notre premier campement en 2011 et nous voulons continuer de grandir. Nous avons besoin de votre aide pour nous rencontrer une nouvelle fois en Aout cette année. Cette fois, nous nous rencontrerons au Portugal, où la troika – l’alliance du FMI, de la Commission européenne et de la Banque Centrale Européenne – avec les gouvernements qui soutiennent leur politique a dévasté le pays depuis 2 ans.
Cette année nous voulons continuer à nous étendre en incluant plus de pays d’Europe de l’est comme la Bosnie Hérzegovine, la Croatie, la Bulgarie, le Montenegro … et pous inviter des femmes des Philippines, de Tunisie et du Kenya. Nous croyons qu’il est important de mettre en lien les femmes malgrè les difficultés politiques et les barrières culturelles afin de briser celles qui ont été construites entre nous pour nous garder faibles et divisées.
Le chômage, la précarité et la pauvreté ont augmenté, hypothéquant la vie de la plupart des gens, et notamment de millions de femmes. Le droit à la santé sexuelle et reproductive devient de plus en plus un mirage pour nombre d’entre nous. Le Portugal est un des seuls pays européens à avoir vu la différence entre les salaires des hommes et ceux des femmes augmenter. Les violences faites aux femmes ont aussi augmentées et se sont intensifiées.
Alors que les années précédentes, nous étions financées par le programme Jeunesse de l’Union Européenne, notre financement de cette année est encore incertain. Nous savons que ces campements ont été des moments cruciaux dans nos vies de jeunes femmes en lutte pour mettre fin aux violences et aux injustices dans nos vies, nos communautés, nos pays. Nous avons vu nos luttes réaffirmées, rendues plus fortes et connectées aux luttes des autres jeunes femmes du réseau des Jeunes Féministes d’Europe des campements des 2 dernières années. Et nous croyons qu’il est important de continuer de se rencontrer, de partager des idées et des exemples de luttes, des succès et des échecs, d’engager encore des conversations parfois difficiles entre nous, de casser les stéréotypes et de collaborer pour rendre le monde meilleur pour toutes les femmes.
Votre contribution nous permettra de nous rencontrer en aout et de continuer de construire le mouvement. En donnant, vous faites aussi part de ce mouvement qui travaille pour en finir avec la pauvreté, le racisme, l’homo-lebo et transphobie, et avec toutes les injustices subies par les femmes dans les différents pays. Si nous atteignons notre objectif de budget, nous pourrons inviter des femmes d’autres pays en dehors d’Europe pour rejoindre nos luttes collectives et devenir plus fortes dans l’unité. Si nous n’atteignons pas totalement notre but, nous pourrons …

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Social injustice has been a huge topic in the ""Western world"" for years now - our governments have heard about it, people are aware and trying to change things. There are all sorts of programs to support disadvantaged people. In many other countries it is up to each inividual to finance basic schooling - many children have to earn money or beg to help the family to buy food.</p>
<p>I just graduated high school and I want to make a change. I know I cannot change the world, but I will certainly change the world of those I work with and for.</p>
<p>I will teach English and Maths to Indonesian kids in a project called ""children's oasis"" in a village calles Jagaraga on Lombok. The local kids go there to learn and to spend their day sheltered rather than on the streets. The children get to play and make music together, they can do handicrafts and learn.<br/>The idea of the project is to help the villagers help themselves. Eventually good education is the only way to enhance the overall structure in poor villages. Education is the key to good working conditions, to further education and to any kind of change. Education is the key to a better tomorrow.</p>
I believe this world could be a lot better if everybody contributed as much as they can. I had the privilege to be born in a country that offers education to everybody. I now want to take some time and spread the blessing - I want to educate people, who then will be able to teach others who again will be able to educate more and more people.<br/><p>I would be very greatful if you'd decide to help educate the children in Jagarage, Lombok, Indonesia. No child should be left behind because they were born in the so called ""third world"" - every child deserves to grow up in a safe environment, to learn and to grow freely.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
Funding is needed for maintenance of the existing buildings but also for a new project connecting to the Oasis: There is a house being built for the older kids (15+). Rather than sending them back to the streets once they are old enough to live by themselves they shall live together in a living community. Together they shall learn how to use what they have learned in the Oasis, together they shall start their own social projects, together they shall live in a friendly community where everybody is appreciated for their individual talents and thoughts.<br/>I will live together with those teenagers for 12 months. I will leave Germany on August 20th and will return in August 2014. I will live in the living community with the Indonesian kids.<br/>Funding is also needed for ongoing expenses (material for crafting, sports equipment,...) and for some special events or expenses (baking day, soccer match, new tomato plants for the yard,...)<br/>If you decide to fund this campaign your money will go straight to the project. My flight, insurance, vaccinations etc. are already funded so each penny will go right to the project - to the street children in Jagaraga.<br/>Indonesia as a country is gorgeous. The landscape is incredible and the people are beautiful. During my stay I will take many photos, which I will post online. Each distributor gets to pick one of the photos posted, which will be sent to them. And don't worry - the photos are well worth it - I have taken many great ones already.</div>
<div>Of course a photo is not ""worth"" as much as your contribution, but you'll get a picture of what you are supporting. Investing in child education is investing in a better future, investing in change. Knowing that you help a child live the life they want is probably the biggest thing you get from funding this project.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution helps to ensure that the ""children's oasis"" won't have to shut its doors at some point of time. The Oasis aims to educate a whole generation of village children who will help to enhance the standard of living of the entire village.</p>
<p>It is important to fight inequalities all over the world. As there's injustice in each and every country the international inqualities are much bigger. We need to help developing countries to develop so that one day the world we live on will not be seperated in the first and third world, but will shine as one world.</p>
Education is the key to a better tomorrow. On the long term education is the only way out of poverty, which is why I am donating a whole year to Jagaraga and asking you to donate some money.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yes, the village is small, there are thousands of poor villages and the Oasis is only active in one of them. Some might say the work will never show any effect. And it won't from a global point of view. But it changes the world of the children that are being taught. It's a great opportunity for each and everyone of them. Growing up in the Oasis rather than in the desert of poverty, exploition, drugs and prostitution should be granted to every child. Please help to change some children's worlds!</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you can't support the Oasis financially prayers are always welcome. It would also be a great help if you'd ""Share"" the campaign on your facebook, via Twitter, google+ or any other site. Or if you'd tell your friends about the Oasis. Maybe you could even talk about it in your church and ask for donations.</div>
<div>Any kind of help is highly appreciated!</div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a PhD student in Geography at Penn State University, researching cross-border cattle trade in Ethiopia, Djibouti and Saudi Arabia.  Pastoralism plays an important role in the economic growth of Africa. Across the continent, an estimated 50 million livestock producers support their families, their communities, and a massive meat, skins and hides industry based on cattle and other livestock.  </p>
<p>Nomadic pastoralists in Africa are known to move their herds across international borders in search of new grazing or for trade. Although this trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration,  there are also risks due to the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade. Such risks may include the spread of disease, unequal market access and drastic changes in cattle price. </p>
<p>My research will involve 'on the ground' interviews and observations along the cattle commodity chain beginning with cattle production in Ethiopia and quarantine in Djibouti and ending with the Saudi export market.  </p>
<p>I have already been awarded a scholarship that covers my travel and research activities, but this funding only covers expenses for me.  As I follow the cow from Ethiopia to Djibouti to Saudi Arabia, please help fund my son's portion so that he may also gain a global perspective on some of the world's most challenging issues.</p>

I also hope to use this experience of traveling abroad with my son as a training opportunity to help many other kids experience service learning and research in developing countries.

<h3>Photo is where I will be living on the San Marco gate wall in Siena. </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I am doing</h3>
<p>My name is Charolette Stoehr. I am 47 years old and a junior at Portland State University. I have the opportunity to study abroad in Italy for a term. This has been a dream of mine all of my life. I am a late bloomer for a college education but I have always known I would go back to school after my kids were grown. I have been studying creative writing, photography, drawing, music, painting and art history. By some divine universal gift, I received a Gilman award  to study abroad. I applied as a dream pie in the sky type of thing and now I am packing up my apartment to go live in Italy for 12 weeks. The study abroad program is called Language and Culture and is located in Siena, Italy.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What I need from you</h3>
<p>I have received a Gilman scholarship for part of the cost of the program but I need to raise $4500 more in funds. The money will be used for travel expenses to reach Siena and living expenses while there. The perks I can offer will be postcards from Italy, links to my travel blog, photos, prints of photos, personal thank you mementos, and an invitation to my presentation on my Italian adventure. I would love to share any and all my travel experiences with you! </p>
<h3>What if I don't meet my goal?</h3>
<p>All of the funds donated will be used for my study abroad even if the goal of $4500 is not reached. So if you donate you are guaranteed to receive your perks.</p>
<h3>Benefits to All </h3>

<p>In addition to sharing my travel journey with you, I have applied to share my travel experiences with a classroom of primary students in NYC. Through a program called Reach The World I can be their very own volunteer travel correspondent and they will study and learn right along with me via a travel journal, photographs and video conferencing.</p>
<p>This is the most exciting part of this experience for me! I want to inspire young people to follow their dreams and never feel they are limited in what they can acheive.  Plus the students will be learning interesting and educational facts about another country. </p>
<p>This experience will help me craft my writing, give me hours of photo opportunities and allow me to share my own unique perspective with the world. I will also receive art instruction, journaling instruction and Italian language instruction, with credits applying toward my Bachelors in Art History. </p>

<p>The <b>help2kids</b> partnership school in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, offers a primary school education to some of the poorest children in the area.

Our teachers all hold teaching diplomas or certificates from colleges across Tanzania and are integral in being positive role models for our children. Their dedication to the students by providing guidance, discipline, and support allows us to give them the best possible foot forward.

<p>But this is REALLY big. It will have all kinds of tools, videos,

How do I mobilize others to help me pursue my dreams? What are the biggest social media traps? Tired of being pigeon holed around your race or gender--redefine the landscape on your terms.

have to finish the final stage of our web design, finalize the

<p>Now that we have finished the first generation of SmartAlert™, we need your help in providing necessary funds to spread the word about this incredible app. The $75,000 we seek to raise will help us achieve our goal of getting SmartAlert™ in 200 schools by the June. That would protect approximately a quarter million children and teachers who have inadequate safeguards against a violent threat on campus.

We need your help to begin activating SmartAlert™ in every school that is seeking to improve the safety of its students and faculty.  Currently, millions of children are virtually unprotected should a violent threat present itself. With your help, we have the power to change that.
Our Goal
Now that we have finished the first generation of SmartAlert™, we need your help in providing necessary funds to spread the word about this incredible app. The $75,000 we seek to raise will help us achieve our goal of getting SmartAlert™ in 200 schools by the June. That would protect approximately a quarter million children and teachers who have inadequate safeguards against a violent threat on campus. The money will also enable us to add more lifesaving features to the app.
SmartAlert™ for SchoolsWith the push of a button on a smartphone, immediately and simultaneously notify all school personnel and the police of a present threat or emergency.The key to minimizing violence in schools is information - - before and during an incident.  Currently, it takes the average school two to five minutes to inform all of its teachers that they must get their children behind locked doors.  SmartAlert™ is a patent pending smartphone app that reduces that time to just 15 seconds.We need your help to get this important technology in every school in the country.Seconds Matter in an EmergencyTime and again, survivors of school shootings say it was the simple act of hiding behind a locked door that saved them.With SmartAlert for Schools, the amount of time elapsed from when a threat is noticed to when children are moved to a safe area is reduced from minutes to seconds.
How it Works
SmartAlert™ is simple, inexpensive and easy to use.
While we cannot stop the next accident or the next tragic occurrence, we can better prepare for it and minimize its effects. SmartAlert™ accomplishes this inexpensively, quickly, and efficiently by utilizing the device we all now possess — the cell phone.

<p>My grandmother was a sharp, witty, and all around awesome woman.  When I was young she developed Type II Diabetes, and while she knew there were things she could do to improve her health; she did not exercise to speak of and would often ""cheat"" in her eating, causing spikes and dips in her blood sugar.  A few years ago her health began to decline and she was moved into an assisted living facility. When I got engaged, I had hoped that she would be able to come to my wedding, even if it was with the assistance of a traveling nurse.  Unfortunately, she was not healthy enough to make the trip from Southern California to the Bay Area.  In fact, she died two weeks after my wedding.  I truly believe that if she had taken better care of herself that she would still be alive today and would have been healthy enough to travel for my wedding.  I also can not help but wonder how much I could have encouraged and guided her; if I knew ten or fifteen years ago, what I'm learning now.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Dr. Rosalyn (Roz) Dischiavo, the founder of the Institute for Sexuality Education and Enlghtenment. I opened the Institute in October of 2011 because I wanted to offer a holisitic view of sex education that was based on body, mind and spirit and focused on the whole person instead of health issues or scare tactics. I am a sexologist, meaning that I study and teach Human Sexuality for a living and I have a doctorate in Human Sexuality and a Master's degree in Marriage and Family Therapy.</p>
<p>I'm asking for help funding scholarships because I get calls daily from people who are very passionate about the issues. Some of them want to educate about sex and disability, sex and aging, sex and religion, sex and ehtnicity, sex and transgender issues, women's sexuality, shame issues, or what have you. One woman called because she wanted to help young war veterans who have been injured in ways that prevent the usual sexual behaviors like intercourse. She wanted them to know that they could still be sexual, still have fulfilling relationships.No one was helping them, and many of them were committing or attempting suicide until she talked to them about their alternatives. But she doesn't have enough information for them, and our program can help. I have kept her phone number, even though she doesn't know that, hoping that I could find a way to help her to help these young men.</p>
<p>Financially many of these people (including the woman mentioned above) cannot afford to pay for the certificate program or to garner more debt. A lot of them have just completed a master's program for counseling, or a bachelor's degree, and they are still paying those programs or loans. </p>
<p>Sex Education is not just important to prevent disease or unwanted pregnancy. Sex education can be a soul-opening experience where we can learn about pleasure, relationships, spirituality, ecology, gender, art, alternative lifestyles, culture, and more. People who explore their attitudes and reduce their shame about sexuality are more alive in every area of their lives.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>As a new school, I don't have the resources for scholarships. I'd like to be able to offer a significant chunk of the tuition (which is $6600 total for the Sex Educators and $8800 for the Sex Therapy education), and I am starting with asking for $1500 so that I can help someone out. If it works well here, I will try again for another student.</p>
<p>If this funding works, I will ask for more for other students.</p>
<p>If we don't achieve our entire goal, I will put whatever we get toward individual workshops for students at $150 (one-day workshop) or $90 (half-day workshop) apiece.</p>
<p>We are an aweseome institute, if I do say so myself. We get into the nitty gritty aspects of sex without forgetting about the soul of sex. We help people to free their minds of prejudices and free their hearts from the burdens of needless shame. We change lives, as my students tell me all the time, by creating a safe, powerful and fun environment for people to transform their ideas, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. We hope you can help us out!</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<div>It may not be a popular viewpoint, but research shows that negative attitudes about sex impact women's and men's rights, birth rates, the health of children, and people's overall happiness (write me for articles, I'm big on verification of what I am saying!). Your contribution will help exponentially because you will be funding someone who teaches others. There are too many sex educators and sex therapists who focus on pathology, illness or other negativity. We need more sex educators with a sex-positive attitude who can truly talk comfortably to people about the issues that are the most sensitive and the most important to them.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you can't help us financially, please let people know about us. You can use the indiegogo share tools to ask folks to fund us, or go to our website at <a href=""http://www.instituteforsexuality.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.instituteforsexuality.com</a> or our Facebook page at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/InstituteforSEEE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/InstituteforSEEE</a> and see what we're about.

<p><strong>The ideology of Muza World is centered around its purpose;<em> “To Inspire and Motivate”.</em></strong></p>
<p>Many students find the current system of education outdated. Our goal is to create a new educational environment that will encourage people to learn. </p>
<p>Muza World revolutionizes the system of education by providing the alternative approaches to learning. All the concepts found in the general biology textbook will be covered in the animations. Information will be presented in a clear and easy to understand format. The Animations are designed to be used by a wide range of students from Secondary School through College and University levels. It will also serve as an excellent guide for preparation for medical, dental and pharmaceutical entrance exams.</p>
<p>The Animations will be designed and produced by an interdisciplinary team of experts in the fields of science, software engineering, and graphic designers. All are supervised by professionals with PhDs in biology and years of teaching experience.</p>
<p><strong>Is animation based education more effective then the traditional? </strong></p>
<p>Yes! Scientific research suggests that using animation can increase student’s grade point average (GPA) up to 15%.</p>
<p><strong>Why is learning through animations so effective? </strong></p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Most of us are visual learners. In other words - watching is usually more effective than simply reading or listening. A picture is worth a thousand words. Through animations, more material can be learned in less time. </p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> The Animations cater to all learning styles – auditory, visual, and verbal, among others. The students can learn the material visually and reinforce it through reading and listening, or vice-versa. Research shows that using multiple learning modules is correlated to better long-term mastery of the material.</p>
<p><strong>How will students know that the animated material provided will be sufficient to do well on the exams? </strong></p>
<p>Our animations present exactly the same concepts as the most popular textbooks used at the leading educational institutions across North America. The content explained in these videos will be edited and verified by experts in the field, who will guarantee that all the essential topics are covered. </p>
<p><strong>Who is being targeted? </strong></p>
<p>Both high school and university students can use the Animations. The Animations also serve as excellent preparatory material for entrance exams to Dental, Medical, Pharmaceutical, and Veterinary schools. </p>
<p><strong>What is the mission of Muza World? </strong></p>
<p>The mission of Muza World is to give students an alternative learning method – one that is enjoyable, easy, and successful. Our goal is to help students attain the highest grade possible. </p>
<p><strong>How exactly will these animations be presented? </strong></p>
<p>You will have access to the course online, where a list of topics covered per subject will be displayed. Each topic is a link to a page with animation, text, audio, and various tools you can use to help you learn.</p>
<p><strong>What languages are Muza World animations offered in?</strong></p>
<p>For now, the animations are offered only in English. We are working on making our animations more accessible across the globe – we plan to animate our videos in Spanish, Russian, Cantonese, German and other popular languages in the near future. </p>
<p><strong>How long does it take to get through the Biology course? </strong></p>
<p>It would take a total of 8 hours to get through a Biology course. Yes, within 8 hours you will be able to learn the same amount of material that is taught at Universities and high schools that normally takes two semesters to learn. However we don’t recommend cramming through the course – taking breaks and going through every animation a couple of times will produce best results. </p>
<p><strong>How can I test my knowledge? </strong></p>
<p>Every video is followed with several questions that check your understanding and provides a score report. Students will also be able to test their knowledge by competing with other members. </p>
<p><strong>At Muza World we believe that education must be affordable.                </strong></p>
<p>Your contribution is needed to cover the cost of producing the animation. We hope you will support this educational project. It can change lives of many students and make the process of learning much more interesting and exciting. </p>

Muza World revolutionizes the system of education by providing the alternative approaches to learning. All the concepts found in the general biology textbook will be covered in the animations. Information will be presented in a clear and easy to understand format. The Animations are designed to be used by a wide range of students from Secondary School through College and University levels. It will also serve as an excellent guide for preparation for medical, dental and pharmaceutical entrance exams.
The Animations will be designed and produced by an interdisciplinary team of experts in the fields of science, software engineering, and graphic designers. All are supervised by professionals with PhDs in biology and years of teaching experience.
Is animation based education more effective then the traditional? 
Yes! Scientific research suggests that using animation can increase student’s grade point average (GPA) up to 15%.
Why is learning through animations so effective? 
a) Most of us are visual learners. In other words - watching is usually more effective than simply reading or listening. A picture is worth a thousand words. Through animations, more material can be learned in less time. 
b) The Animations cater to all learning styles – auditory, visual, and verbal, among others. The students can learn the material visually and reinforce it through reading and listening, or vice-versa. Research shows that using multiple learning modules is correlated to better long-term mastery of the material.
How will students know that the animated material provided will be sufficient to do well on the exams? 
Our animations present exactly the same concepts as the most popular textbooks used at the leading educational institutions across North America. The content explained in these videos will be edited and verified by experts in the field, who will guarantee that all the essential topics are covered. 
Who is being targeted? 
Both high school and university students can use the Animations. The Animations also serve as excellent preparatory material for entrance exams to Dental, Medical, Pharmaceutical, and Veterinary schools. 
What is the mission of Muza World? 
The mission of Muza World is to give students an alternative learning method – one that is enjoyable, easy, and successful. Our goal is to help students attain the highest grade possible. 
How exactly will these animations be presented? 
You will have access to the course online, where a list of topics covered per subject will be displayed. Each topic is a link to a page with animation, text, audio, and various tools you can use to help you learn.
What languages are Muza World animations offered in?
For now, the animations are offered only in English. We are working on making our animations more accessible across the globe – we plan to animate our videos in Spanish, Russian, Cantonese, German and other popular languages in the near future. 
How long does it take to get through the Biology course? 
It would take a total of 8 hours to get through a Biology course. Yes, within 8 hours you will be able to learn the same amount of material that is taught at Universities and high schools that normally takes two semesters to learn. However we don’t recommend cramming through the course – taking breaks and going through every animation a couple of times will produce best results. 
How can I test my knowledge? 
Every video is followed with several questions that check your understanding and provides a score report. Students will also be able to test their knowledge by competing with other members. 
At Muza World we believe that education must be affordable.                
Your contribution is needed to cover the cost of producing the animation. We hope you will support this educational project. It can change lives of many students and make the process of learning much more interesting and exciting. 
Thank you for the support. We welcome you to Muza World.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Hiyam, and I am originally from Dallas, Texas.  In 2009, I decided to go back to school to get a graduate degree.  I did this because I thought it would ensure a better future for me in my chosen career--film production.  I did this because, like many Americans, I was hoping to ride out the recession, naively thinking that the economy would be vastly better by the time I graduated.  I did this because I had been told my entire life that the more education you have, the more job opportunities are available to you.</p>
<p>Not many of us were counting on the economy staying so difficult for so long.  I certainly wasn't.  Grad school expenses were significantly more than what government loans and scholarships were able to provide for.  In the absence of rich relatives, my only choice for continuing my education was to take out private loans.</p>
<p>I have now found out the hard way that private loans are much less forgiving than government loans for education.  There is no deferment option at all.  My interest rate is much higher--at almost 12%!  There are no repayment options such as income-based repayment like with government loans.  Loan consolidation is the only option.</p>
<p>My first private loan bill arrived just in time for Christmas for $657.  Yes, that's $657 every month for that one loan.  That does not include my government loans, which are currently in deferment.  I called my private loan lender and told them that I simply don't have the money.  They said that I am eligible to apply for for a one-time-only six-month forebearance period only after I make a good faith payment of $657, five days before Christmas.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I could not afford to go home for Christmas in December.  I had to borrow the money from my mother to make the payment, which has now put her in a financially difficult situation.  For many people, $657 is as much as a mortgage or rent payment.</p>
<p>So, that is why I have created this campaign.  I need help to pay these private loans.  Right now, I'm barely making rent and bills.</p>
<p>What I Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I need $17,500 to help me pay my loans.  In truth, this is but a fraction of the $55,000 that I owe in private loan debt, but I want my funding goal to be realistic.  $17,500 will help enormously, and it will buy me more time to get on my feet financially.</p>
<p>I am not the type of person to beg for money, so I want to offer my original photographic prints in return for your contribution.  I have several 'perks' listed to the right in return for your donation.  If you have any questions about the photographs before donating, please let me know.</p>
<p>You can choose from the photographs here: <a href=""http://www.hiyamsandwich.com/5.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.hiyamsandwich.com/5.html</a></p>
<p>The funds will all go towards my debt.  My immediate goal in life is to not go hungry and homeless.  Seriously.  That is where I'm at right now financially, and that's how much of a difference your contributions will make, so please give anything you can.  Even if I don't reach my entire goal of $17,500, it will still be of help to me.  Any amount will help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your funds will help me pay my debt, plain and simple.  I just can't afford to pay an additional $657 a month when I'm not even making my rent and bills.  I am unemployed, and I continue to look for work.  The way I see it is that I am trading a good for a monetary contribution from you.  You are giving me the opportunity to produce some of my work for you, so I can hold my head up with pride instead of simply begging you for your money.</p>
<p>I do have a successful track record with IndieGoGo campaigns.  Last year, I raised my entire goal to make a film.  Because of those contributions, I was able to make the film and to watch it make a very successful film festival run.  My hope is that my film will help advance my career as a filmmaker.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I certainly understand that not everyone can afford to contribute financially.  If you'd still like to help, you can!  Please share this campaign with all of your friends and family members.  </p>
<p>College loan debt has recently topped credit card debt in America.  I am amongst many recent graduates and parents who are riddled with debt, and the future looks bleak under such circumstances.  The federal government has taken some steps to help ease payments on federal government loans, however, very little has been done to help those of us with private loans, too.  In fact, Congress last year deregulated some of the legislation on private loan lenders, which is why my interest rate is allowed to be as high as 12% or more.  With no payment options available to me beyond consolidation, what am I to do?</p>
<p>That's why it's so important that you help me spread the word about this campaign.  I need your help today.</p>
<p>Please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<p><strong>Education is a Right!</strong></p>
<p>If you believe this notion, then you too understand that the “Achievement Gap” is arguably the largest fundamental problem facing our country, and specifically its children, today.</p>
<p>At all levels of education, literacy continues to be a major factor in the widening of the achievement gap between those children who are blessed with much, and those children unlucky enough to be born into a poverty stricken environment.</p>
<p><strong>Education is a Right!</strong></p>
<p>No child should be denied the opportunity to get a great education just because of the geography of his/her birth.</p>
<p>Help me make a difference in the lives of my students. Help me give students their Right to a great education. Help me close the achievement gap, while at the same time energizing my students about the wonders of Chemistry. </p>
<p>This ambitious project seeks to bring a literacy curriculum to my chemistry class. If you've never read The Disappearing Spoon, then you missed out on one of the most engaging, interesting and mind expanding texts about that boring old Periodic Table of the Elements. This national best seller brings the Periodic Table to life!</p>
<p>If I am able to raise the full $2000 ($1860 after processing costs) for this project, I will be able to not only bring actual books into my classroom, but the supplies needed to supplement this literacy curriculum.</p>
<p>Here is how it breaks down: </p>
<p>Approximately $1650 of the funds will go towards the purchase of 180 books - 1 for each of my students, with a couple of extras just in case.</p>
<p>The remaining $210 will be used for general classroom supplies for labs and other instruction related to the chemistry curriculum. </p>
<p>My school provides no budget for copy paper, much less lab supplies. Every dollar spent will have a direct impact on the lives of my students. </p>

We are the founders of two unique career resources. The first is a free career advice blog called, CAREEREALISM. The second is a motivating job search program designed to help people find work faster. It's called CareerHMO.
Why We Need Your Help
In spite of the improvement in our unemployment rate in the U.S., there are still 23 million Americans who are out of work. Many of whom are long-term unemployed (6+ months). These individuals are struggling to pay for the necessities, like food and housing. As a result, they do not have the means to pay for cutting-edge career resources that can help them get on track to finding work faster. These people need a scholarship to a program that will give them the information, tools and coaching support needed to find a new job. They need an ally. They need you!

<p>The most commonly reported primary substance of abuse among DUI/DWI admissions to substance abuse treatment was alcohol (90 percent). Impaired driving continues to be a severe and persistent threat to public health and safety. In 2007, an estimated 2.5 million people were injured or killed in motor vehicle accidents.<a href=""http://www.samhsa.gov/data/2k9/204/204DUIFaclty2k9.htm#fn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><sup>1</sup></a> Of these, 13,000 were deaths attributable to alcohol or drug involved vehicle crashes, and these fatalities accounted for nearly one third of all vehicular deaths in the United States. Individuals arrested for driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated (DUI/DWI) can be diverted to a treatment program either before formal judgment or after conviction as part of sentencing. DUI/DWI programs are most often conducted in an outpatient setting and can be shorter than other outpatient programs. Understanding the characteristics of DUI/DWI clients may help program designers and planners to tailor their interventions to better meet the needs of their clients.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a measurable relationship between alcohol and crime. According to CrimeSolutions.gov, (2013)  “alcohol also impact crime indirectly via the effects they have on users’ behavior and by their association with violence and other illegal activity in connection with their manufacture, distribution, acquisition or consumption.” Para. 1.

</ul><p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Alcohol abuse and DWI awareness is a core factor in real prevention and intervention. Therefore, a comprehensive awareness campaign is critical toward making sure that everyone is fully knowledgeable of the real dangers of alcohol abuse and DWI on local, state, and national levels. The proposed awareness campaign will aim to emphasize such topics as: resistance training, knowledge of immediate effects of alcohol use, identification of the risks of alcohol misuse, and recognition of social pressures that lead to alcohol misuse and the increasing rate of DWI: especially among youths. This DWI preventive intervention program for both youths and adults is designed to help individuals make better decisions about using alcohol and driving. The program provides drug or alcohol treatment services to persistent drug and alcohol users toward improving people’s quality of life and one free from alcohol and substance abuse. The DWI program provides alcohol treatment and education, as well as case management and intensive supervision services that will assist in reducing the current DWI trends.</p>
<p>Prevention, intervention, and treatment does work. Rempel and colleagues (2003) found that participation in the Brooklyn Treatment Court (BTC) reduced recidivism by 27 percent after 3 years and by 18 percent after 4 years, relative to the comparison group level. For those who did recidivate at least once, the average number of days to the first re-arrest within 4 years was 524 days for BTC participants, compared to 391 days for the comparison group. With respect to specific charges, after 3 years, BTC participants were about half as likely as the comparison group to have a new felony conviction; the difference continued and remained significant at 4 years as well. BTC participants were also less likely to have a new misdemeanor and new drug conviction at both 3 and 4 years. As such, DWI rates and crime were reduced in the program servicing area.</p>
<p>Dr. Grange asserted, ""I have seen the devastation of DWI and DUI in the inner city and nationwide. This occurrence affects the victim as well as all who are involved. With this methodology of education and safety for those who drive, it is my hope to save people by prevention and education.”</p>

</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Citoyen Haïti is a five-week leadership academy and summer experience for high-achieving Haitian high school students. This summer, the program will take place from June 10th – July 19th in Port Au Prince, Haïti. </span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Citoyen Haïti believes in the untapped potential of Haitian youth as well as the Haitian diaspora, and seeks to inspire students with a passion for their country and a thirst for its improvement in the 21st century and beyond. We aim to do this by recruiting Haitian university and high school students to aid us in the planning of the curriculum and work with their student counterparts, as well as by:   </p>
<ul>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Networking students and professionals across a field of each student’s choice, with the aim of contributing toward their understanding of a potential career path and how they can take strides towards their chosen field’s improvement within Haïti, specifically.</span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Imbuing students with skills necessary for positions with clout, including but not limited to people, risk, stress, and time management, as well as public speaking and negotiation skills. </span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">Establishing, encouraging, and developing goals related to the betterment of Haiti that will be deeply and personally tied to each student. </span></li>
</ul><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As our inaugural summer approaches, we hope that you will join us as we attempt to reach our objectives of promoting a strong generation of student-citizens. We anticipate that this summer will provide a platform for Haitian students and experienced professionals from both Haïti and the Yale community to develop common goals and equip students with the specific tools and practical guidance they need to drive Haitian development. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><em><strong>More detailed information about the program can found on our website: <a href=""http://www.citoyenhaiti.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.citoyenhaiti.org</a></strong></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Citoyen Haïti cannot operate without the generous support of sponsors and benefactors. Gifts are critical to the financial health of the program and enable us to pursue a unique and interactive curriculum that will keep the students we work with engaged and safe. Giving to Citoyen shows loyalty to a program and a belief in the next generation’s capacity to make positive contributions to society.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Your donation will ensure that students are able to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world experiences through field observations and conversations with businessmen,  politicians and prominent figures within the Haitian community and diaspora. It will also provide each student with a lunch meal a day, furnish them with materials, pay for the use of their classroom facilities, and jumpstart their final projects. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We rely on financial support from organizations and individuals like you to fund a comprehensive program that we one day hope to see replicated in other developing nations. We request your support under any of the donation gift clubs to the right. </span>Donations above and below the leadership gift club levels are equally appreciated.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Citoyen Haïti’s origins are deeply rooted in the conception of education as a pipeline to success: students with a solid educational foundation are more likely to achieve greater future success, especially if they acquire schooling at or beyond the secondary school level. At Citoyen Haïti, we believe that there is a third, missing component that truly determines the breadth of a student’s accomplishments: their leadership skills. In a nation like Haïti, mired with struggles ranging from natural disasters to widespread poverty, the need for student-leaders with a deep dedication to their country is a woefully under-addressed problem. Citoyen will imbue in every student that participates the means and inspiration to affect very real, very impactful change within their country on their own - and you can help!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Donations above and below the leadership gift club levels are equally appreciated. Please share this information with members of your community - we couldn't possibly do this without you!! Furthermore, any in-kind donations that could help the students out in their pursuit of self-awareness and a better country - your time and advice as a guest speaker, schoolbooks, and other conventional donations - would also be appreciated!</p>
<h3>Want to learn more about the curriculum?</h3>
<p>Sure!</p>
<p>Instructor-Analysts – the teachers and mentors of the program – will work with students in one of six different task forces whose work will be reflective of a corresponding Ministry in the Haitian government<strong> (Finance and Economy; Justice and Public Service; Women’s Rights; Public Health; Education and Vocational Training; and Communications and Arts). </strong>The curriculum is best explained through its stages, outlined here for the Justice and Public Service Ministry:</p>
<p><strong>Teach: </strong>From June 10th to 14th, students will be taught how to examine the Ministry of Justice and Public Security from a comparative perspective. Instructor-Analysts will give them a broad overview and understanding of different types of legal systems, including their positives and negatives, as well as their evolution and theories related to where they are more beneficial than elsewhere and why that might be. Students will also be given a comprehensive overview of the Haitian legal system, as well as general lessons in proposal writing, how to conduct field research, and how to analyze and present data collected from conducting surveys or observations. At the end of the week, students will be challenged to discuss what legal system seems to be ideal for the Haitian government.</p>
<p><strong>Observe: </strong>From June 17th to June 21st, students and Instructor-Analysts will supplement their knowledge of the Justice system with actual observations. Students will be taken to the Ministry of Justice in Port Au Prince to see the Minister’s work in action. They will visit the Supreme Court of Haiti, speak to lawyers and clerks operating in the central city, observe a trial, and visit a detention center. The students will leave Port Au Prince to conduct the same observations in the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p><strong>Strategize: </strong>From June 24th to July 5th, the students will, with the guidance of their Instructor-Analyst, develop solutions for issues they will highlight from their observations.

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
Citoyen Haïti is a five-week leadership academy and summer experience for high-achieving Haitian high school students. This summer, the program will take place from June 10th – July 19th in Port Au Prince, Haïti. 
Citoyen Haïti believes in the untapped potential of Haitian youth as well as the Haitian diaspora, and seeks to inspire students with a passion for their country and a thirst for its improvement in the 21st century and beyond. We aim to do this by recruiting Haitian university and high school students to aid us in the planning of the curriculum and work with their student counterparts, as well as by:   

Networking students and professionals across a field of each student’s choice, with the aim of contributing toward their understanding of a potential career path and how they can take strides towards their chosen field’s improvement within Haïti, specifically.

Imbuing students with skills necessary for positions with clout, including but not limited to people, risk, stress, and time management, as well as public speaking and negotiation skills. 

Establishing, encouraging, and developing goals related to the betterment of Haiti that will be deeply and personally tied to each student. 
As our inaugural summer approaches, we hope that you will join us as we attempt to reach our objectives of promoting a strong generation of student-citizens. We anticipate that this summer will provide a platform for Haitian students and experienced professionals from both Haïti and the Yale community to develop common goals and equip students with the specific tools and practical guidance they need to drive Haitian development. 
More detailed information about the program can found on our website: www.citoyenhaiti.org


What We Need & What You Get
Citoyen Haïti cannot operate without the generous support of sponsors and benefactors. Gifts are critical to the financial health of the program and enable us to pursue a unique and interactive curriculum that will keep the students we work with engaged and safe. Giving to Citoyen shows loyalty to a program and a belief in the next generation’s capacity to make positive contributions to society.
Your donation will ensure that students are able to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world experiences through field observations and conversations with businessmen,  politicians and prominent figures within the Haitian community and diaspora. It will also provide each student with a lunch meal a day, furnish them with materials, pay for the use of their classroom facilities, and jumpstart their final projects. 
We rely on financial support from organizations and individuals like you to fund a comprehensive program that we one day hope to see replicated in other developing nations. We request your support under any of the donation gift clubs to the right. Donations above and below the leadership gift club levels are equally appreciated.


The Impact
Citoyen Haïti’s origins are deeply rooted in the conception of education as a pipeline to success: students with a solid educational foundation are more likely to achieve greater future success, especially if they acquire schooling at or beyond the secondary school level. At Citoyen Haïti, we believe that there is a third, missing component that truly determines the breadth of a student’s accomplishments: their leadership skills. In a nation like Haïti, mired with struggles ranging from natural disasters to widespread poverty, the need for student-leaders with a deep dedication to their country is a woefully under-addressed problem. Citoyen will imbue in every student that participates the means and inspiration to affect very real, very impactful change within their country on their own - and you can help!


Other Ways You Can Help
Donations above and below the leadership gift club levels are equally appreciated. Please share this information with members of your community - we couldn't possibly do this without you!! Furthermore, any in-kind donations that could help the students out in their pursuit of self-awareness and a better country - your time and advice as a guest speaker, schoolbooks, and other conventional donations - would also be appreciated!
Want to learn more about the curriculum?
Sure!
Instructor-Analysts – the teachers and mentors of the program – will work with students in one of six different task forces whose work will be reflective of a corresponding Ministry in the Haitian government (Finance and Economy; Justice and Public Service; Women’s Rights; Public Health; Education and Vocational Training; and Communications and Arts). The curriculum is best explained through its stages, outlined here for the Justice and Public Service Ministry:
Teach: From June 10th to 14th, students will be taught how to examine the Ministry of Justice and Public Security from a comparative perspective. Instructor-Analysts will give them a broad overview and understanding of different types of legal systems, including their positives and negatives, as well as their evolution and theories related to where they are more beneficial than elsewhere and why that might be. Students will also be given a comprehensive overview of the Haitian legal system, as well as general lessons in proposal writing, how to conduct field research, and how to analyze and present data collected from conducting surveys or observations. At the end of the week, students will be challenged to discuss what legal system seems to be ideal for the Haitian government.
Observe: From June 17th to June 21st, students and Instructor-Analysts will supplement their knowledge of the Justice system with actual observations. Students will be taken to the Ministry of Justice in Port Au Prince to see the Minister’s work in action. They will visit the Supreme Court of Haiti, speak to lawyers and clerks operating in the central city, observe a trial, and visit a detention center. The students will leave Port Au Prince to conduct the same observations in the surrounding countryside.
Strategize: From June 24th to July 5th, the students will, with the guidance of their Instructor-Analyst, develop solutions for issues they will highlight from their observations. This time may or may not involve travel back to a specific location or communication with a specific person as the students, or travel to a new location. Students may want to create a new legal system hybrid and are encouraged to simulate their solutions with each other or real people. Regardless of their solutions, students will be encouraged to write out research proposals for further studies (or to simply conduct them!) in order to support their theories and ideas.
Inspire: From July 8th to July 12th, students will prepare to present their combined proposals to each other and to businessmen, politicians, and prominent figures within the Haitian community and abroad. These include the Ministers of each of the aforementioned departments. Additionally, an invitation has been extended to Haiti’s current President and Prime Minister with tentative approval. The end of the program will culminate in a three-day conference period wherein the students discuss what they have learned, seen, and concluded based upon their weeks spent at Citoyen.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Rachael Asher and I am 20 years old. I have always wanted to study in Europe and after years of trying and saving I finally have a visa for education in Belgium, and although I have spent the past two years saving money so I can do it, a little help from others never hurt!</p>
<p>I have been an honor roll student my entire life, making the deans list both semesters I was enrolled in college in the US. I plan to continue my good academic past in Antwerp, as well as push myself harder to achieve greater things.</p>
<p>My set date to move is September 15th. I will be leaving behind almost all of my belongings and friends in the USA. It will be a hard transition, but my boyfriend and his family will be welcoming me to my new home in Antwerp.</p>
<p>I've been to Belgium twice now, both times with my hard earned money, and I absolutely fell in love with the city of Antwerp. Now, I get the chance to continue my studies in Belgium as well as be with a person I love very much.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So to break it down, here's an example of what a single 100 dollar donation could do. Each bullet represents an individual 100 dollar donation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay for almost 2 weeks of rent!</li>
<li>Pay for my food for a month!</li>
<li>Buy me a cellphone and pay the bill for 6 months.</li>
<li>Buy me all the books I need for my first year of school.</li>
<li>Pay my health insurance for 2 months.</li>
<li>Buy me 9 round trip train tickets!</li>
<li>Pay for 1/8 of my school each year!</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that donations are accepted in amounts lower than 100. This is just an easy way to explain where the money would go!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Each and every donation allows me to stay longer in Belgium. I do plan on getting a work permit when I arrive as well as working through the holidays, but there are never any guarantees for employment, and I will need help!</p>
<ul>
<li>This may not be for some huge charity or for a super awesome documentary, but it's about creating a future and living a dream to better myself and the world around me.</li>
<li>I've never had a previous campaign, but I did spend a lot of my highschool years volunteering through several projects including: Step up Cincinnati, Relay for Life, 5k For Haiti, and several others. Now, I find myself in the position to ask for help, instead of giving it.</li>
<li>For anyone who knows me, they know that I never ask for much. I don't like being a hinderance to people. It takes a lot for me to ask for help, no matter how much I need it.... But this is so important to me. It's been my whole life, and I hope that with your help, I can continue to live my dream.</li>

<h3>Promises for Families Foundation<br/>
</h3>
<p>Promises for Families is a non-profit organization that serves families and children with a parent incarcerated.  When a child's parent goes to prison, life as they know it ends.  They enter a grieving process just as any of us do when a loved one is taken from our midst.  We provide summer camp and after school programming for children by partnering with other organizations (churches, YMCA, scouting groups, and community outreach service providers) to efficiently use precious human and financial resources.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>On any given day in America, 1.5 million children have a parent incarcerated.  More than 10 million are living with a parent who has come under some sort of criminal justice supervision during the child's life.  The challenges faced by these families are significant.  Not only do they face the trauma of loss and grief, but also a range of social and economic challenges.  We strive to provide trained professionals to mentor these children with the hope of breaking the cycle of inter-generational incarceration. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Programs and What Is Needed<br/>
</h3>
<p>Our program uses four components - music, movement, art, and nature.  Health RhythmsⓇ recreational music protocol is an evidence based program proven to promote health and wellness in many populations.  Health RhythmsⓇ is complemented with YogaKidsⓇ, the preeminent children's yoga program endorsed by many health care professionals.  Art and Nature therapy round out the program, and the four components combine to address the needs of the whole child.  <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Funds raised through IndieGoGo will be used to purchase musical instruments, equipment, art supplies, and a small trailer to transport equipment to and from program sites.  </span>All of our staff are trained in their respective disciplines.  Our music director, Mr. Arthur Thompson, has been working with at-risk youth for fifteen years, and is a master drum circle facilitator.  Our director, Mrs. Katy Hoskins, has certifications in counseling and art education, and is a YogaKidsⓇ instructor.  We have additional staff that are specialized in outdoor activities, tai chi, aerobic dance, and even equine therapy.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> On April 4th, a donor offered to match, dollar for dollar, contributions made through IndieGogo up to $2,500....your gift will be doubled!</span></span></span><br/></p>

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>Mac Ha village is located 7 km from Sapa town in Northern
Vietnam.  It is the most impoverished
area of the Sapa region and home to more then 1,000 Black H'mong ethnic
minority people living in and around Ma Cha village. TET Lifestyle Collection supports
the 150 children in the local school from kindergarten to 5th grade. Our long
term focus is to continue to support the Ma Cha school so these children are
able to have a more comfortable environment in which to learn, grow and
develop.  As we believe education is the key to breaking the cycle of
poverty.</p>
<p> Before TET Lifestyle Collection support, most of these
children had no shoes, many had no pants and they certainly had next to no
school resources. Going to school in Winter for these children was and still is
extremely difficult. Close your eyes and imagine for a moment what it must be
like for these children to firstly walk up to 6km bare foot over rice fields to
school each morning when the temperature in winter is often minus 5 degrees Celsius.
Once at school the children sit in cold cement class rooms with no heating
while the wind whistles through the broken windows and doors.  </p>

Cha School for 8 years.  The past 5 years
we have held our “Help Keep Us Warm” campaign. In December 2008, 2009, 2010,

These days, Becky spends 40 hours + a week as the Program Manager for a local community center that provides services for residents of Red Hook Houses, the largest public housing complex in Brooklyn, NY where she has lived for the last 11 years. There she manages a team and oversees the development of job readiness and training programs for unemployed young adults in the neighborhood. She has contributed over 10 years of her time to the organization and has a diverse employment history because of her commitment to growing and reaching new heights. 
Becky is also a certified HIV testing counselor and a DYCD Family Development Training and Credentialing (FDC) counselor with extensive experience working on community health issues in Red Hook. She continues to look for opportunities and experiences that uplift her in her career and this time, she needs our help!

    Building Momentum--- A Life's journey . 

Momentum Education is a series of self awareness workshops that have impacted the lives of thousands. Becky was fortunate enough to experience the first workshop but needs our help with getting to the next one! The price, $950. 
Why Momentum? The value that Becky received from the first, Basic Workshop, had a huge impact in changing her outlook on life. She has a desire to continue to explore the barriers in her life that are keeping her from reaching her full potential, faster.  She has always been motivated and a go-getter but, like most of us, can admit that there is always room for improvement. For Becky, this is her time to go as far as she can go to seek new and profound possibilities! Will you help?   
Help us help Becky spread the word!

</p><p>The MAKC was founded in the mid-1990s by western
Pennsylvania cavers with a passion for protecting caves while providing access for
scientific and recreational activities. The mission of the MAKC is to preserve
caves and karst terrain in the mid-Atlantic region through the acquisition and
leasing of properties with caves.  MAKC has acquired nine cave and karst
preserves in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, totaling over 5,000 acres. Two of
these properties are owned, and the remainder leased. These cave preserves are
described in detail on the MAKC website, <a href=""http://www.karst.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.karst.org</a>.<br/></p>
<p>In the late 2000s, it was identified that protecting caves
and karst areas were not the only important functions for the MAKC. With the
aging and passing of long-time cavers, cave related literature and
periodicals were also in need of protection for both current and future cavers. 
Books, periodical collections, cave notes, maps, and other related documents
were about to be lost for future generations to appreciate. The MAKC realized
that these collections would likely be sold off, lost, and dispersed if nothing
was done to preserve them. With this in mind, the MAKC began formulating the
idea of acquiring a central location in the mid-Atlantic area where these
collections and other materials from donors could be housed and used by current
and future cave researchers.</p>

</p><p>The MAKC secured a commitment from Bob and Beverly Danielson
for a sizable donation, along with other generous donors, to acquire property for a cave and karst library. With
these commitments, the MAKC set about to locate a building that was sufficiently
large enough to house the books and publications known to be available, yet
also large enough to accommodate the future publication contributions. The
Blairsville, Pennsylvania area was selected due to the number of active MAKC
members living in proximity to this town, the location of many caves in the
area, and because property values in the area were attractive. In 2009, an
early 20th century, three bedroom house was identified in Blairsville at a very
good price. The property was purchased with the grants, and
the Danielson Library and Education Center was realized.</p>
<p></p><p>
</p><p>The house was in poor repair when purchased. Over the next
several years, thousands of man hours and additional donations were used to
redo much of the house interior. The house was rewired to bring to
code, bathrooms redone, hardwood floors refinished, insulation added, and
many other projects undertaken. Additionally, the collections of books and
periodicals were contributed, cataloged, archived, and stored in the library.
Many individuals and organizations contributed documents, but the major
contributors to the library in the Danielson Center were Jack Stelmack (former
NSS President), Dale Ibberson, and Jack Speece. While there are still some
remaining interior projects, the inside has progressed well. </p>
<p></p><p>
</p><p>Our present need is to address the exterior of the building, and
is the purpose of this crowd funding effort. Other than a door replacement and
front stoop repairs, little has been done to the exterior. The local code
enforcement officer and the MAKC insurance agent have pointed out several
deficiencies that need to be addressed ASAP. The soffits, fascia and storm
gutters are rotted and decayed, and are literally falling off the building! In
addition, the roof has reached its life span and should be replaced. Additionally
the surrounding neighborhood is pretty nice and the library is in need of
painting to more closely match the condition of surrounding homes and

</h3><p>3D scanners are a great way to create models for 3D printing.  The problem is that most are either too expensive or too low quality for good 3D printing.</p><p></p><p>When we began work on the Molecule 3D scanner, our goal was to make sure it was extremely precise and easy to use. We considered every element that defined professional 3D scanners - the processors, cameras, build quality, turntable design, projected light scanners and laser based scanners. </p><p>Sure, there are all kinds of 3D scanners today -- from projected light scanners that connect via a tablet that are handheld and fast, to traditional flat-bed/turntable scanners that are too often slow and stationary -- but none are accurate, unless you have $15,000 to spend. So we challenged ourselves to design and engineer a 3D scanner that not only was extremely precise and accurate but also fast, low cost and affordable.</p><p>Now you can shape a model of any objectives by Molecule 3D, which will definitely simplify your work, save your effort, and improve your efficiency considerably.</p><p>We make Molecule 3D to complete the Scan-to-Print solution in an easier and better way, With Molecule 3D, you can scan whatever object you like automatically, turn it into a digital 3D model on your computer. The standard STL format model is seamlessly compatible with any desktop 3D printers. You don’t even need to be a professional 3D model engineer, all the digital models are ready to print.</p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453688045/qx9mojkcvubr3zt9tmgt.png"" src="""" style=""width: 616.3172804532578px;height: 370px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453688185/jhetmrnsvmlrga7zo2yu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">

<br/><h2>How It Works: </h2>
<p>Molecule 3D works by illuminating an object with laser light and then using 3D triangulation to generate a point cloud for each location where the laser hits the model.  Neighboring points are then connected by triangles to form a 3D model.  This model can be used as-is for many purposes or it can be processed in a software package such as Meshlab to make it water-tight and print ready.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Easy to use, one-touch scanning</b></p>
<p>We believe that 3D scanning should be as simple as its 2D counterpart, and accessible to everyone. Yet today's 3D scanners are either very expensive or require significant effort to produce acceptable results. Many systems require the user to learn how to perform complex and tricky calibration. Most require the user to manually collect a set of 3D images around the object which must then be aligned and combined through post processing steps.</p>

<h2>Design &amp; Manufacturing</h2>Our product was “designed for manufacturing” from the very beginning. This meant designing the product and it’s components taking into consideration the limitations and capabilities of actual industrial equipment and processes, Of the seven major prototypes that we iterated through in the last 12 months, only three were 3D Printed, the rest were machined on the very machines that will mass manufacture your molecule 3D scanners. This upcoming batch of pre-mass manufactured units helps us figure out a variety of things, such as the optimal cutting speed/feed rates and the overall manufacturing workflow. These units are also the ones we will be using for certification. As this is a critical last step before scaling to mass-manufacturing, more time spent carefully and diligently here pays big dividends in the future.<br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPMfrEA3UKNU%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPMfrEA3UKNU&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453125636/duenji3vgzsqkoajos8u.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p></figure>

4/14/2016 We are at MakePro Hatch Night

VideoHello, this is Molecule 3D!
3D scanners are a great way to create models for 3D printing.  The problem is that most are either too expensive or too low quality for good 3D printing.When we began work on the Molecule 3D scanner, our goal was to make sure it was extremely precise and easy to use. We considered every element that defined professional 3D scanners - the processors, cameras, build quality, turntable design, projected light scanners and laser based scanners. Sure, there are all kinds of 3D scanners today -- from projected light scanners that connect via a tablet that are handheld and fast, to traditional flat-bed/turntable scanners that are too often slow and stationary -- but none are accurate, unless you have $15,000 to spend. So we challenged ourselves to design and engineer a 3D scanner that not only was extremely precise and accurate but also fast, low cost and affordable.Now you can shape a model of any objectives by Molecule 3D, which will definitely simplify your work, save your effort, and improve your efficiency considerably.We make Molecule 3D to complete the Scan-to-Print solution in an easier and better way, With Molecule 3D, you can scan whatever object you like automatically, turn it into a digital 3D model on your computer. The standard STL format model is seamlessly compatible with any desktop 3D printers. You don’t even need to be a professional 3D model engineer, all the digital models are ready to print.
What's in the BOXMolecule 3D  is provided in the form of kits.  No soldering or electrical knowledge is required to build the Molecule 3D kits.  All of the components simply screw together.  The user must print the plastic parts for each kit.Inside the Box:The Full Kit contains everything.  This includes 1. Molecule 3D control board2.  1.3megapixel CMOS sensor x23. Laser modules,4. 5V power supply5. Stepper motor6. rubber coating, rubber feet, and all of the fasteners and cables.7. User Manuel8. Molecule 3D Scan applicationMolecule 3D detail drawingTechnical SpecUnit Size    210x218x405 mm Scan Volume  160 x200 mmHigh and FOV Adjustment


 


How It Works: 
Molecule 3D works by illuminating an object with laser light and then using 3D triangulation to generate a point cloud for each location where the laser hits the model.  Neighboring points are then connected by triangles to form a 3D model.  This model can be used as-is for many purposes or it can be processed in a software package such as Meshlab to make it water-tight and print ready.

Easy to use, one-touch scanning
We believe that 3D scanning should be as simple as its 2D counterpart, and accessible to everyone. Yet today's 3D scanners are either very expensive or require significant effort to produce acceptable results. Many systems require the user to learn how to perform complex and tricky calibration. Most require the user to manually collect a set of 3D images around the object which must then be aligned and combined through post processing steps.
Our 3D scanner will change that. With the Molecule 3D you simply put your object into the scanner, press a button and scan. The result is a fully aligned and meshed colour point cloud. No alignment, no post processing, no training - although we encourage you to read the manual first!

The system uses a turntable and two unique and patented scanning webcams, one to the side and one set above the object, to maximise coverage.

Vous devez avoir envie de dire...bon pourquoi pas ? D'ailleurs on ne célèbre pas uniquement π, mais les mathématiques en général dans tout ce qu'elles ont de plus attrayant et vivant. Le nombre π est simplement devenu un symbole des mathématiques: on a tous fait la connaissance de π à l'école pour calculer la circonférence ou l'aire d'un cercle; on retrouve π partout dans notre quotidien (si si, les mathématiques sont partout, dans la cuisine, la musique, la magie et même les relations amoureuses !). </p><p>La première journée de π fût organisée en 1988 par le physicien Larry Shaw à l'Exploratorium de San Francisco. L'événement comprenait notamment la dégustation de tartes (pie en anglais).

Ce jour a été choisi en raison de l'écriture américaine 3.14 de la date du 14 mars, qui évoque la valeur décimale approchée du fameux nombre π. À Marseille, nous fêtons depuis 2013 cette constante qui fait tourner le monde, à grands renforts de tartes (pie en anglais) et autres réjouissances. Le but de notre journée est de divertir, instruire et bien sûr nourrir  un public affamé de science !""Pourquoi célébrer le nombre π ?"" Vous devez avoir envie de dire...bon pourquoi pas ? D'ailleurs on ne célèbre pas uniquement π, mais les mathématiques en général dans tout ce qu'elles ont de plus attrayant et vivant. Le nombre π est simplement devenu un symbole des mathématiques: on a tous fait la connaissance de π à l'école pour calculer la circonférence ou l'aire d'un cercle; on retrouve π partout dans notre quotidien (si si, les mathématiques sont partout, dans la cuisine, la musique, la magie et même les relations amoureuses !). La première journée de π fût organisée en 1988 par le physicien Larry Shaw à l'Exploratorium de San Francisco. L'événement comprenait notamment la dégustation de tartes (pie en anglais). Depuis, le concept s'est répandu et de nombreux événements divers ont eu lieu à travers le monde notamment dans la ville de Princeton, qui célèbre aussi par la même occasion l'anniversaire du célèbre physicien Albert Einstein.L'association Pi day et notre philosophieLe projet de la Tournée de π est porté par l’association Pi Day, association loi 1901, composée de doctorants et de jeunes chercheurs en mathématiques et informatique vivant pour la plupart en France, qui se consacre à la diffusion et la promotion des mathématiques et des sciences en général auprès du grand public.Au-delà de l'organisation des Journées de π (tous les 14 mars à Marseille depuis 2013), on a participé à plusieurs événements de diffusion scientifique, comme la Fête de la Science (éditions 2015, 2016), le Salon Culture et Jeux Mathématiques (édition 2016) et le Forum des mathématiques vivantes (édition 2015), etc.Pour l’originalité, l’ampleur et la réussite de ses activités, l’association a notamment reçu le prestigieux Prix d’Alembert de la Société de Mathématiques de France (SMF), récompensant les initiatives de diffusion mathématique auprès du large public. Afin de mobiliser l'attention et la réflexion du public, un gros travail sur la forme est nécessaire. Les séquences courtes (15 minutes) et diverses (exposés, comédie musicale) qui s'alternent permettent de garder l'attention du public, en combinant l'aspect attrayant d'un spectacle et profond d'un exposé scientifique.  Nos objectifs sont d'attiser la curiosité du public sur des questions scientifiques (mathématiques, physiques, informatiques, etc.), de transmettre aux jeunes l'intérêt et la passion pour les mathématiques et les sciences, et bien sûr de faire passer au public une soirée agréable et divertissante !Le spectacleLe spectacle reprendra le modèle inédit qui a fait le succès de l’édition 2016 de la Journée de π : une comédie musicale mathématique entrelacée de 3 conférences scientifiques tout public de 15 minutes chacune, type TED, dans une grande salle de spectacle. Nous avons planché sur l'écriture d'une toute nouvelle comédie musicale pour cette année, et sommes impatients de vous la faire découvrir sur scène. L’ensemble de la soirée s’articule cette année autour du thème scientifique du hasard : les conférenciers apportent différents points de vue ou questions sur le hasard vu à travers le prisme de leurs différentes disciplines (probabilités, physique, informatique, épistémologie etc.).La comédie musicale, From Marseille to Vegas, qui met en scène des jeunes chercheurs marseillais, aborde les thèmes des jeux de hasard, et du rôle grandissant des mathématiques dans la société.Les éditions précédentes de la Journée de πNotre équipe s’est formée en 2013 autour de la création d'un séminaire des doctorants à Marseille. Rapidement, le rendez-vous convivial entre doctorants et étudiants a cherché à attirer plus de monde. De là est née l'idée d'organiser des événements festifs et originaux pour aller vers le public. Le coup d'envoi est donné le 14 mars 2013 avec la Journée de π. L'événement, qui se déroule alors sur le campus de l'université, reprend le concept américain du π day. Au programme : un concours de tartes, un exposé de mathématiques, et la diffusion du film « Dimensions » par A. Alvarez, E. Ghys et J. Leys. La journée connaît un franc succès, couvert par la presse locale, qui encourage l'équipe à continuer.En 2014, la Journée de π a reçu des invités, dont Jean-Paul Delahaye, auteur notamment du livre « Le fascinant nombre π ».Journée de π 2015L'année 2015 fût très particulière puisque nous étions le 3.14.15 (plus précisément encore à 9h26 et 53 s, nous étions le 3.14.15 9:26:53) !

We are renovating our space to create a more engaging environment for our community, residency, education, and social entrepreneurship programming. Your support will contribute to making Santa Fe a nexus for innovative social change. At SFAI, we believe in blue sky thinking: as an interdisciplinary institution we can serve as a center for developing creative approaches to address the most pressing issues of our times.Santa Fe Art Institute (SFAI) is a cultural organization that seeks to address a critical question: how can SFAI cultivate creative practices (from fine art to design to urban planning and beyond), engage with diverse communities, and address the most pressing social issues of our time?SFAI is a hub for creative engagement and social change. We facilitate this through a renowned residency program bringing together creative practitioners from all over the world, to educational programming that includes the groundbreaking Design Workshop, and public programs that celebrate local innovators and activists like SFAI 140 and Conversations @ SFAI. Our building, built in 1999 by the Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta, has played host to over 1,000 artists in residence and numerous public programs.  Since that time SFAI has grown. With that in mind, we need to expand access to our courtyard and kitchen space in order to provide our community with more inclusive programming like workshops, group dinners, receptions, and retreats.  These renovations will include installing large glass doors to provide direct access to our courtyard and an open chef style kitchen - more conducive to conversations, engaging events, and communal housing. We’re hoping to have these renovations completed by the end of the year so that 2016 can usher in another term of exciting program development. With your contribution, you buy into creating innovative approaches for positive social change. If you believe in the role creativity plays in public education, if you believe in the benefit of cultivating exchanges with local, national, and international artists, if you believe in supporting social innovation in Northern New Mexico, then contribute to SFAI. We are hosting several public events that coincide with our campaign this summer. We look forward to seeing you! Participate in our engaging programming and network with the dynamic SFAI community.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Fresh off the best men’s basketball season in school history, the program has momentum and has significantly increased the number of men’s basketball players that are transferring to play on scholarship at four year universities. After being invited to compete in one of the best community college tournaments in California, we decided that this was an incredible opportunity for our student athletes. The Clippers were also able to secure an extra single game so the trip is full of as many games as possible.</p>
<p>The exposure this opportunity will provide our program will be invaluable. Our student athletes will play in a high profile tournament in front of four year coaches who normally wouldn’t get to see our players compete in person. This will enhance their recruiting opportunities and also give our program a chance to extend our name beyond the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>The student athlete experience will be incredible. Students will get to travel together and visit places they normally wouldn’t visit in a typical season. This will be a wonderful life experience but also help them develop relationships and strengthen the team.</p>

<div><strong>*****UPDATE 2 - Oct 1st 2016 - we have so far tonight, 33 candidate interviews and will have about 40 - 50 by the end of the upcoming week; money isn't the only way you can help - share the interviews - show what is possible - ask other media to interview these candidates.  THANK YOU to the people who donated money (very much) I am going to donate some of my own money also to the purpose of advertising - you can still contribute and continue to help - please visit our website to watch the interviews and get more info, even though this crowdfund campaign's about to end the story per se continues . . . at libertarianprogressive.com</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>*****UPDATE - Sept 27th 2016 - we 5 have days left until this crowdfund is over - we have 41 days until the election - so far we have 25 independent and 3rd party candidate interviews (across the spectrum) - these candidates are on the ballot and the only 3rd option in their district - by the end of the week we will have over 30 - <u>spread the Word</u> - every donation you give will go to advertising these candidates as a whole - even $5 will help - do what you can, share the interviews also - and thanks . . . </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<i>This is restated from the</i> <strong>What We Need / What You Get</strong> section below BUT it is the main point &amp; why we are asking for your help (and to envision this campaign), BTW I hear many people say ""<i>I have never heard of any other candidates running in my area from the media</i>"" - let's change that ASAP :</div>
<div>
<strong>DISPLAY ADS</strong> - Tons of them - (mostly YouTube, some newspapers/publications &amp; some radio) - This is one of the most important aspects - it doesn't do much good to offer news about options if no one is aware they exist.  This will reach millions of people, resulting in questioning status quo thinking, it will open hearts and minds creating new neural networks to newly discovered possibilities and encourage thinking outside the box per se, it will build the foundation for media who don't ignore (on the ballot) independent and third party candidates.  Who, what, when, where &amp; WHY type questions. </div>
<div>
<strong>Imagine watching YouTube and / or seeing display ads in media asking</strong>: </div>
<div>
<strong>1</strong>. Do you know all your options this year for Congress? </div>
<div>
<strong>2</strong>. Have you considered this year voting for an independent or third party candidate? </div>
<div>
<strong>3</strong>. Have you researched all of the candidates in your local elections yet before you vote this November, do you know where to look? </div>
<div>
<strong>4</strong>. Would you like to participate in making: the environment in America better for small and mid-sized businesses?  Cannabis Legal?  A more peaceful and prosperous world? </div>
<div>
<strong>5</strong>. Would you be opposed to living during a new Renaissance? </div>
<div>
<strong>6</strong>. Why doesn't the media usually cover, nor invite to political debates, independent and third party candidates who earned being on the ballot? </div>
<div>
<strong>7</strong>. Do you know what unites most everyone? </div>
<div>
<strong>8</strong>. Does fair competition matter regarding better options?  Would more competition in politics result in Representatives being more responsive?  Did you know almost all other first world countries have more competition in their politics than the US? </div>
<div>
<strong>9</strong>. Does Congress exist to represent and serve the people who elect them or do the people exist to serve them?  i.e. who's in charge?  If you were a professional writer and you had an agent and they ripped you off, would you fire them or give them a raise? </div>
<div>
<strong>10</strong>. etc. </div>
<div>
<u>Right now</u>, overwhelmingly, almost all ads shown are usually over the top silly and are about Trump, Obama and Clinton and have silly questions with them.  Imagine a flood of strategic ads in popular venues that are thought provoking, intelligent and will take people to our websites which shows them <strong>50</strong>+ qualified candidates, well presented along with resources to research more.  There quite is a vacuum regarding this information right now.</div>

<h3><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">LibertarianProgressive.com is an independent, up &amp; coming media organization.</font></h3>
<p>We interview independent and 3rd party candidates who are on the ballot (Green Party, independents, Libertarians, No Party Affiliation and other parties).</p>
<p><font color=""#333333""><font size=""3"">We believe if a candidate has gathered enough signatures to be on the ballot and has a statistical chance to win then a responsible media will include them in the debates and interview them, to educate and inform the public of their options.</font></font></p>
<p><font color=""#333333""><font size=""3"">Our goal is to interview 50+ candidates every 2 year election cycle (mainly for the US House of Representatives, but not exclusively) &amp; reach a large audience.</font></font></p>

<p><font color=""#333333""><font size=""3"">We tried to exclusively conduct interviews where the candidate was the only 3rd option and will continue to do so (to build consensus).  We launched in 2012 - it was a passion of love for truth - we exercised our responsibility and our right of a free press to get the word out.</font></font></p>
<p><font color=""#333333"" size=""3"">2016 - Your support is important to grow LibertarianProgressive.com for 2016, 2018, 2020 and beyond.  We want to reach a much larger audience via macro-advertising (w/ better production quality).  Now that the primaries are over - you will be seeing more interviews consistently every day - most people usually start paying attention to the elections a month in. </font></p>

</div></div>","*****UPDATE 2 - Oct 1st 2016 - we have so far tonight, 33 candidate interviews and will have about 40 - 50 by the end of the upcoming week; money isn't the only way you can help - share the interviews - show what is possible - ask other media to interview these candidates.  THANK YOU to the people who donated money (very much) I am going to donate some of my own money also to the purpose of advertising - you can still contribute and continue to help - please visit our website to watch the interviews and get more info, even though this crowdfund campaign's about to end the story per se continues . . . at libertarianprogressive.com
 
*****UPDATE - Sept 27th 2016 - we 5 have days left until this crowdfund is over - we have 41 days until the election - so far we have 25 independent and 3rd party candidate interviews (across the spectrum) - these candidates are on the ballot and the only 3rd option in their district - by the end of the week we will have over 30 - spread the Word - every donation you give will go to advertising these candidates as a whole - even $5 will help - do what you can, share the interviews also - and thanks . . . 
 

This is restated from the What We Need / What You Get section below BUT it is the main point & why we are asking for your help (and to envision this campaign), BTW I hear many people say ""I have never heard of any other candidates running in my area from the media"" - let's change that ASAP :

DISPLAY ADS - Tons of them - (mostly YouTube, some newspapers/publications & some radio) - This is one of the most important aspects - it doesn't do much good to offer news about options if no one is aware they exist.  This will reach millions of people, resulting in questioning status quo thinking, it will open hearts and minds creating new neural networks to newly discovered possibilities and encourage thinking outside the box per se, it will build the foundation for media who don't ignore (on the ballot) independent and third party candidates.  Who, what, when, where & WHY type questions. 

Imagine watching YouTube and / or seeing display ads in media asking: 

1. Do you know all your options this year for Congress? 

2. Have you considered this year voting for an independent or third party candidate? 

3. Have you researched all of the candidates in your local elections yet before you vote this November, do you know where to look? 

4. Would you like to participate in making: the environment in America better for small and mid-sized businesses?  Cannabis Legal?  A more peaceful and prosperous world? 

5. Would you be opposed to living during a new Renaissance? 

6. Why doesn't the media usually cover, nor invite to political debates, independent and third party candidates who earned being on the ballot? 

7. Do you know what unites most everyone? 

8. Does fair competition matter regarding better options?  Would more competition in politics result in Representatives being more responsive?  Did you know almost all other first world countries have more competition in their politics than the US? 

9. Does Congress exist to represent and serve the people who elect them or do the people exist to serve them?  i.e. who's in charge?  If you were a professional writer and you had an agent and they ripped you off, would you fire them or give them a raise? 

10. etc. 

Right now, overwhelmingly, almost all ads shown are usually over the top silly and are about Trump, Obama and Clinton and have silly questions with them.  Imagine a flood of strategic ads in popular venues that are thought provoking, intelligent and will take people to our websites which shows them 50+ qualified candidates, well presented along with resources to research more.  There quite is a vacuum regarding this information right now.
 
Ride the Wave campaign - Part 1 of 5 :

LibertarianProgressive.com is an independent, up & coming media organization.
We interview independent and 3rd party candidates who are on the ballot (Green Party, independents, Libertarians, No Party Affiliation and other parties).
We believe if a candidate has gathered enough signatures to be on the ballot and has a statistical chance to win then a responsible media will include them in the debates and interview them, to educate and inform the public of their options.
Our goal is to interview 50+ candidates every 2 year election cycle (mainly for the US House of Representatives, but not exclusively) & reach a large audience.
In 2012 we interviewed 50+ on the ballot, independent and third party candidates running for the US House & Senate from a full spectrum of American politics (to our knowledge this is the most independent and third party interviews conducted by one organization in a campaign season).
We tried to exclusively conduct interviews where the candidate was the only 3rd option and will continue to do so (to build consensus).  We launched in 2012 - it was a passion of love for truth - we exercised our responsibility and our right of a free press to get the word out.
2016 - Your support is important to grow LibertarianProgressive.com for 2016, 2018, 2020 and beyond.  We want to reach a much larger audience via macro-advertising (w/ better production quality).  Now that the primaries are over - you will be seeing more interviews consistently every day - most people usually start paying attention to the elections a month in. 
2016  -   Ride the Wave - Part  2  - The fundamental questions

What does LibertarianProgressive mean?  What is consensus?There are about  324 million people in the USA.There are about  219 million people eligible to vote and about  146 million registered to vote.42% are independent29% are Democrats26% are Republicans<1% are special interestsWho has the most influence do you think?
If there were  10 issues important to you, and  5 issues had popular consensus and  5 didn't, which  5 would you prioritize first?
LibertarianProgressive is advocating uniting and winning, instead of being divided & conquered.
There will be plenty of time to argue on things that we disagree about AFTER we pass legislation regarding important things we agree upon :
1. Accountability & Transparency reforms, freedom of information, integrity safeguards, auditing our government.
2. Civil Liberties, NSA privacy & spying, preserving the Bill of Rights, due process.
3. Corporate Cronyism, Lobbyists, no bid contracts, bailouts, the revolving door.
4. Military Spending, mission creep, regime change foreign policy, Congressional approval & oversight.
5. Ending the Drug War, reform the justice system, asset forfeiture, demilitarization of police, private prisons, mandatory minimums, quotas, racial profiling, industrial hemp.
6. Election reform, open primaries, Election Day holiday, fair debates, rank or score voting, none of the above option, paper trail.
7. Fair and Free Trade.
8. Promoting an environment of growth and opportunity, less regulation and more competition for small and mid-sized businesses.
There are  435 members in the US House of Representatives, elected every  2 years - it was designed that way on purpose, to be the least resistant, most peaceful and quickest path to reform, in our democratically elected Republic.
Talking with people regarding Congress is a lot less divisive then Presidential politics.

<p>Pre-fund the 2017 SHG Harvest Party!</p>
<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>The SHG Harvest Party is an annual event filled with creative costumes, games, activities, and lots of time to visit with friends, old and new.  This year's party will be held on October 29th from 2pm-5pm.</p>
<p>Rather than selling tickets, we use donations to cover the costs of the party. This crowd-funding website helps us raise the donations.</p>
<p>We are now starting fundraising for this year's party. The system is simple enough. If we raise enough money, we get to have the Harvest Party. If we do not raise the money, we do not have the party, and everyone keeps the money they contributed/pledged. </p>
<p>Recommended contributions are $30 per family. Larger contributions help us cover the costs of those who cannot afford to donate. </p>
<p>There are many opportunities to volunteer your time and support our community at this event. Please contact Andrea at msmuppet@gmail.com for more information.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Your Harvest Party Team (Andrea Shullaw, Kristina Bulajewski, Sandee Lium,  and Scott Steinhorst)</p>

The SHG Harvest Party is an annual event filled with creative costumes, games, activities, and lots of time to visit with friends, old and new.  This year's party will be held on October 29th from 2pm-5pm.
Rather than selling tickets, we use donations to cover the costs of the party. This crowd-funding website helps us raise the donations.
We are now starting fundraising for this year's party. The system is simple enough. If we raise enough money, we get to have the Harvest Party. If we do not raise the money, we do not have the party, and everyone keeps the money they contributed/pledged. 
Recommended contributions are $30 per family. Larger contributions help us cover the costs of those who cannot afford to donate. 
There are many opportunities to volunteer your time and support our community at this event. Please contact Andrea at msmuppet@gmail.com for more information.
Thank you,
Your Harvest Party Team (Andrea Shullaw, Kristina Bulajewski, Sandee Lium,  and Scott Steinhorst)",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>The Communication Academy &amp; why we need your help</h3>
<p>The Communication Academy was founded by Dr. Rick Rodrick and Janet Weir, M.S.,  to provide affordable communication lessons for anyone who knows they could communicate better (in short, pretty much everyone).</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Rick Rodrick and Janet Weir are seasoned educators. Together they have more than 40 years of communication teaching and coaching experience. In addition, their continuing involvement in non-academic activities has given them the ability to tailor their teaching to a broad audience with many different personal experiences.</li>
<li>""Our passion is helping others learn to communicate more effectively. For many years, our students and friends have encouraged us to find a way to bring our classroom lessons to a broader audience. We believe we have unique insights into communication that go beyond what most people have learned. Through our videos we are going to provide original content based on our understanding that communication is not just a way for information to get from one person to another but also as an ongoing process of creating and shaping the world we live in.""</li>
<li>While each video and video series is small, the lessons will be large. A significant part of our day involves communicating with others. Communication problems create outcomes that are disappointing (or just plain bad), create extra work, or just make life miserable. Everyone can benefit from communication lessons. Our experience is that well-crafted communication lessons improve peoples lives in immediate and lasting ways. They can't solve every problem or make any of us perfect communicators (there's actually no such thing) but it will make things easier!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We could just shoot some video (we even have a fancy camera) and place it on the web as we shot it. Unfortunately unedited content is not what most people want in their online lessons. Unedited video is fine for a report on your granddaughter's dance recital or your BFF's raft trip down the Colorado. We aim for more. We want to create high quality, affordable lessons that you and others <i>want</i> to watch, so editing is an absolute necessity.</p>
<ul>
<li>As communication professionals we know how to edit video. Unfortunately, though, video editing requires a reasonably powerful computer. That's where your contribution comes in. We are planning to raise $600. With the funds raised we will purchase a computer that can edit video quickly enough to take on the task efficiently. The $600 will also allow us to purchase video editing software that is powerful enough for the task (we plan to use Cyberlink's Power Director software). We plan to use a local computer sales and service company (probably Enu Inc.) to build a dedicated video editing computer. By building a computer rather than buying one ""off-the-rack"" we will get maximum return on your contribution.</li>
<li>We want you to experience what you are supporting. Everyone who makes a $25 or higher contribution will receive two <i>contributor's only </i>communication lessons! We're sure you'll find these videos beneficial.</li>
<li>Of course we hope to achieve our entire goal amount. If we don't, however, we will combine what we have raised with our own personal funds and get an adequate computer. Not our first choice, of course, but rest assured that any contribution you make will move us one step closer to producing and distributing high-quality, affordable, and insightful lessons. These videos will be valuable internet content.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Campaign Outcome</h3>
<p>Video Production has become quite straight-forward and we have the background to film and edit creative and effective lessons. Unfortunately for us, while semi-retirement does give us time, it doesn't come with any spare cash. That's where you and this indiegogo campaign come in. We need a new computer. Our present processing power is simply not sufficient to edit video. The $600 we raise from this campaign will provide us with a dedicated video computer and reasonably powerful video editing software. We have the rest of the equipment we need so this $600 will allow to bring powerful and useful communication lessons to anyone with internet access.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course we don't know that people will flock to the opportunity for affordable communication lessons. We do know that people want to communicate more effectively. We do know that communication understanding and skills can be effectively presented in a video format. Most of all, we know that we have a passion for helping people communicate. With this knowledge we are confident about our product.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the biggest hurdle is probably getting the word out. Fortunately, our backgrounds in communication include work with campaigns. The Communication Academy campaign will concentrate word of mouth promotion with social media. Of course that is what seemingly every web project plans to do. We believe that the benefit people receive from our lessons, and their affordable price (we are working from a price point of $100 for a series of three lessons) will promote word of mouth. We plan to provide people who purchase lessons with opportunities to provide feedback to us and opportunities to share their value with others who are interested,</li>
<li>Before our first lessons are released we will create a Facebook page, web page, Twitter account and other social media platforms. These platforms will be designed as a location for testimonials and a source for information about lessons as they near release.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
