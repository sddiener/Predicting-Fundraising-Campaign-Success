<h3>About The Show</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anisa and Dalton met at College of DuPage back in 2016. They have been working on school and independent projects since then. During the global pandemic, with little work out there, Anisa and Dalton decided to write something funny to help bring joy during hard times. After months of long nights and discord meet-ups thus The Mis-Scripts was born.</li>
<li>The Mis-Scripts is a comedy Web Series in the same vein as <i>It's Always Sunny in Philidephia </i>and <i>Community</i>. So what do you get when you have a motley crew of film students and an overbearing and obnoxious principal who will do anything to stop them? Well, you get a bunch of Mis-Scripts who get called to action and try to stop him in his tracks first!</li>
<li>We want to give special thanks to our families, friends, and the community for taking the time to help us thrive and succeed during our production. With the amount of support we received, we can’t thank them enough. Hopefully, with your help, we can return the favor to these amazing individuals.</li>

You are our art tribe. Because of the support and loyalty of you our community, we have been able to teach hundreds of thousands of people to paint worldwide in over 250+ countries. Together, we have learned so much over the last three years and we are ready to take that experience, and with your help, create the next generation of the Sherpa Studio to carry that mission into 2018.</p><p>We are blessed with an amazing community of viewers who follow us on YouTube. Our community support, along with patrons, and strategic partners has allowed The Art Sherpa family to thrive. But, the day-to-day expenses of studio operations does not leave much in the budget for anything else. We need your help to take the next step.</p><p>Together, we would like to build a new studio set and upgrade our production. We have big dreams to create new, interactive experiences and art adventures like you have never seen before. You have watched us push the boundaries of teaching art online. We’ve set the standard of How-To Acrylic on YouTube and now we plan to raise that bar. </p><p>To thank you for contributing to our Studio Fund, we have created some compelling Perks below. Please take a look at our plan, and if you like what we have in mind, we would love your support.</p><p> </p><h2>Sherpazoids Unite!</h2><h3>The Plan</h3><p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506554731/bqals1gs89fgqebcwm1i.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p><p>We have broken down our studio development strategy into 5 primary goals and 2 secondary goals. The first 5 Phazes are the core goals to accomplish and reach the next level. Our secondary Phazes represent overfund goals and what we will do with those funds if we are so lucky! While we know some details may change slightly, this is our plan and we are ready to start building!</p><p>**Sherpa Note: We know we it’s spelled phase, we just liked it with a “z”. :-)</p><h3>Phaze 1: Set Walls and Decor $3200</h3><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506555778/ztmhjlh7dlyzw2deq8sd.png"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>This is the core of all the work moving forward. New stage flat walls, a door, basic electricity, a new easel, interactive touch screen and some new decoration. The new set will allow Cinnamon to finally capture her vision of an art sanctum and share it with you. The new wall flats will be built to meet live stage event standards and greatly improve the safety and reliability of our set day to day. We will add a dedicated 220V-30amp service to the studio to provide the necessary power for lighting and servers. Inside the studio, we will have new electrical break out panels, stingers, and on set power distribution.</p><p>We are designing a new pallet table, 'hands' work space, and easel to help capture better camera angles. These custom build sets will allow us better use of the space we have, while making it more enjoyable for the viewer and much more comfortable for Cinnamon to teach.</p><p>An interactive touch screen is one of the best parts of this Phaze. This amazing tool allows Cinnamon to draw directly on the screen to assist in painting and drawing lessons during live shows. </p><p>**Sherpa Note: Cinnamon believes that this will actually help her definitely teach clouds, or at least explain what those things are doing up in the sky. And probably some branches and flowers too. (maybe lighting, and oh what about underwater...)</p><h3>Phaze 2: Lighting and DMX $500</h3><p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506555920/ikzpjhd91txijt2lcogm.png"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>Long time viewers of the show know that we have worked hard to keep color accuracy as true as possible and lighting is the biggest part of that. In our new studio, we will incorporate full spectrum, dimmable LED panels replacing our existing fluorescent lighting fixtures. The new lights are not only brighter so we need less of them, but they are much cooler as well. This translates to a consistent color balance between our camera shots, overall better lighting, and better painting conditions in the studio.</p><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506556140/dnwkuojyoipbsd3kckms.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>While we are rewiring all the lights, we will also upgrade to DMX512 lighting controls. That means, we will be able to change lighting focus or mood at the touch of a button, control the bubble machine, and incorporate more great stage effects like smoke and lasers! Not only will it make the set more fun, but it also makes our studio much safer. All of the electrical wires, switches, and plugs can be pulled up and away from our studio space with no need to manually adjust the lights. All of this will be accomplished from the control desk from now on.</p><h3>Phaze 3: Rigging and Security - $500</h3><p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506568898/mach88mscyecetx29tvm.png"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>Theaters used to use rope, pulleys, and counterweights to raise an lower the curtain just like a ship raises and lowers it’s sail. So ever since some creative Thespians purchased their stage equipment from the sailors (or pirates), its has been called Rigging… Just like on a ship. Now that we are getting our studio ship shape, we need some rigging too. Over the last couple hundred years theater tech has evolved, so we are going to need more than a few standard ropes and pulleys.</p><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506614379/bewot7zgxjyph4tqxjfz.png"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>First thing, we will create strong anchor points for all the lights and electrical cables necessary. Runners and rails will be installed so we can drop green screens and swap out lights without much difficult. And most importantly, we will add redundant security cable points at every light fixture in case a clamp fails, the cable prevents the light from falling.</p><p>**Sherpa note: Please don't let my lights fall on me John!!!**</p><p>While we are securing things, we will be upgrading our existing alarm system.

By selecting high quality refurbished components, we can stretch our server budget enough to get a serious graphics machine to handle all the new streaming features. This new server will provide three primary functions. First, provide storage space for our video clips, music, and visual effects for live shows. Second, it will manage the capture and storage of our final videos, and finally, it will allow for expanding and higher quality graphics, to be added to our live stream events. </p><h3>Phaze 5: Robocam 2.0 - $3800</h3><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506620855/pbqlm8i9xktyhojzoio3.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>Robocam set the standard in close up painting shots, and now we know how to make ‘him’ even better. Bigger lens, faster servos and one heck of a quiet iris, Robocam 2 is a huge improvement in video fidelity. Not only can we zoom in even closer (EXTREME CLOSE UP GARTH!) but we have more accurate control of gain and color correction from the studio control booth.</p><p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506650462/zkdkpndjwdemxnrk2xte.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>With the upgrade of Robocam 2, we also have a new control board that can handle even more Robocams and allow for smoother pan, tilt and zoom operations. Robocam 1 will stay in service and offer additional zoom angle shots.</p><h3>Phaze 6: Interactive Sherpa Graphics (Overfund Goal 1)</h3><p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506620969/pfcmfphowd6tfyfol3ay.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>Now that we have all this cool new tech, we need to build some graphics to experiment with it!  While we can't afford a real snow machine, virtual snow would be fun! (And less damaging to the artwork) We would like to develop a new set of broadcast graphics for the 2018 season that utilizes the new amazing power of our new graphics server. This will include a new intro, lower thirds (name plate) transition animation, and experimental interactive elements. This new system is capable of some really astounding interactive integration for our live stream events and we look forward to pushing these broadcast boundaries on YouTube in 2018.</p><h3>Phaze 7: Robocam Invasion (Overfund Goal 2)</h3><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506641951/uuunnbsrscavngvu3nkq.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>Like Tribbels, you can’t have just one… and who only wants one anyway! Klingons not withstanding. Bring on the ROBOT INVASION!</p><p>We want Robocam 2 on both the left and right zoom angle shots. This way, we will never miss a close up and the color will perfectly match as well. Robcam 1 will be moved to the overhead allowing all our camera angles to be adjusted remotely.</p><h3>Community Responsibility</h3><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506557411/eduorrrs9264sexpxbtq.jpg"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>When we started planning this project, our first objective was to be transparent in our goals and what we plan to do with the donations you provide us. And we are committed to continuing that transparency if we see success beyond our initial goals.</p><p>With additional budget, we could choose a faster server, get a few more lights, and improve some of the choices we are making in the studio. We need a lot of basic things upgraded in the studio and a little extra capitol would go a long way to make that happen. Ranging from a new laser printer to both Cinnamon and John needing a good chair, we will keep everyone posted on how we use the funds to build our new community space. </p><p>What about the SherpaMobile? We realized that before we could invest in our mobile broadcasting, we needed to get some of the basics in the main studio first.

In order to build our new set, we need access to a complete wood and electrical workshop, along with the expertise needed to run it all. But as luck would have it, John's good friend Mike (a master carpenter) offered to build all the new sets in his workshop, come install it and rewire our studio, we just needed to get the materials! WOW!!! With an offer like that, we had to explore our options. After a talking to a few more friends, more offers of help and great deals on lights, cameras and servers to improve the studio started to emerge. We have done extensive research on each stage of our plan to make sure we can successfully execute each Phaze as we achieve that funding level. With this confluence of events, we realize now is the time to accept the loving offers of help, and take the Sherpa studio to the next level.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506647644/pcfad6hto6hx9ggoohkb.png"" hspace=""20"" src=""""/>Many hands make for light work, and if you can’t contribute financially, THAT'S OK!  You can still help JUST by sharing this fundraiser on your social pages to get the word out in support of free art for everyone!

the love for teaching art with a mission to bring free art education to anyone around the world. You are our art tribe. Because of the support and loyalty of you our community, we have been able to teach hundreds of thousands of people to paint worldwide in over 250+ countries. Together, we have learned so much over the last three years and we are ready to take that experience, and with your help, create the next generation of the Sherpa Studio to carry that mission into 2018.We are blessed with an amazing community of viewers who follow us on YouTube. Our community support, along with patrons, and strategic partners has allowed The Art Sherpa family to thrive. But, the day-to-day expenses of studio operations does not leave much in the budget for anything else. We need your help to take the next step.Together, we would like to build a new studio set and upgrade our production. We have big dreams to create new, interactive experiences and art adventures like you have never seen before. You have watched us push the boundaries of teaching art online. We’ve set the standard of How-To Acrylic on YouTube and now we plan to raise that bar. To thank you for contributing to our Studio Fund, we have created some compelling Perks below. Please take a look at our plan, and if you like what we have in mind, we would love your support. Sherpazoids Unite!The PlanWe have broken down our studio development strategy into 5 primary goals and 2 secondary goals. The first 5 Phazes are the core goals to accomplish and reach the next level. Our secondary Phazes represent overfund goals and what we will do with those funds if we are so lucky! While we know some details may change slightly, this is our plan and we are ready to start building!**Sherpa Note: We know we it’s spelled phase, we just liked it with a “z”. :-)Phaze 1: Set Walls and Decor $3200This is the core of all the work moving forward. New stage flat walls, a door, basic electricity, a new easel, interactive touch screen and some new decoration. The new set will allow Cinnamon to finally capture her vision of an art sanctum and share it with you. The new wall flats will be built to meet live stage event standards and greatly improve the safety and reliability of our set day to day. We will add a dedicated 220V-30amp service to the studio to provide the necessary power for lighting and servers. Inside the studio, we will have new electrical break out panels, stingers, and on set power distribution.We are designing a new pallet table, 'hands' work space, and easel to help capture better camera angles. These custom build sets will allow us better use of the space we have, while making it more enjoyable for the viewer and much more comfortable for Cinnamon to teach.An interactive touch screen is one of the best parts of this Phaze. This amazing tool allows Cinnamon to draw directly on the screen to assist in painting and drawing lessons during live shows. **Sherpa Note: Cinnamon believes that this will actually help her definitely teach clouds, or at least explain what those things are doing up in the sky. And probably some branches and flowers too. (maybe lighting, and oh what about underwater...)Phaze 2: Lighting and DMX $500Long time viewers of the show know that we have worked hard to keep color accuracy as true as possible and lighting is the biggest part of that. In our new studio, we will incorporate full spectrum, dimmable LED panels replacing our existing fluorescent lighting fixtures. The new lights are not only brighter so we need less of them, but they are much cooler as well. This translates to a consistent color balance between our camera shots, overall better lighting, and better painting conditions in the studio.While we are rewiring all the lights, we will also upgrade to DMX512 lighting controls. That means, we will be able to change lighting focus or mood at the touch of a button, control the bubble machine, and incorporate more great stage effects like smoke and lasers! Not only will it make the set more fun, but it also makes our studio much safer. All of the electrical wires, switches, and plugs can be pulled up and away from our studio space with no need to manually adjust the lights. All of this will be accomplished from the control desk from now on.Phaze 3: Rigging and Security - $500Theaters used to use rope, pulleys, and counterweights to raise an lower the curtain just like a ship raises and lowers it’s sail. So ever since some creative Thespians purchased their stage equipment from the sailors (or pirates), its has been called Rigging… Just like on a ship. Now that we are getting our studio ship shape, we need some rigging too. Over the last couple hundred years theater tech has evolved, so we are going to need more than a few standard ropes and pulleys.First thing, we will create strong anchor points for all the lights and electrical cables necessary. Runners and rails will be installed so we can drop green screens and swap out lights without much difficult. And most importantly, we will add redundant security cable points at every light fixture in case a clamp fails, the cable prevents the light from falling.**Sherpa note: Please don't let my lights fall on me John!!!**While we are securing things, we will be upgrading our existing alarm system. Well, we won’t go into too much detail about this, for security reasons… ;)Phaze 4: Video Server - $2000Improving the reliability of our streams is a big priority for us, and the stability of our computer systems is that foundation. (Who shall be named KEVIN THE KRACKEN!!!!) We have selected a factory refurbished HP Workstation to serve as that next building block. By selecting high quality refurbished components, we can stretch our server budget enough to get a serious graphics machine to handle all the new streaming features. This new server will provide three primary functions. First, provide storage space for our video clips, music, and visual effects for live shows. Second, it will manage the capture and storage of our final videos, and finally, it will allow for expanding and higher quality graphics, to be added to our live stream events. Phaze 5: Robocam 2.0 - $3800Robocam set the standard in close up painting shots, and now we know how to make ‘him’ even better. Bigger lens, faster servos and one heck of a quiet iris, Robocam 2 is a huge improvement in video fidelity. Not only can we zoom in even closer (EXTREME CLOSE UP GARTH!) but we have more accurate control of gain and color correction from the studio control booth.With the upgrade of Robocam 2, we also have a new control board that can handle even more Robocams and allow for smoother pan, tilt and zoom operations. Robocam 1 will stay in service and offer additional zoom angle shots.Phaze 6: Interactive Sherpa Graphics (Overfund Goal 1)Now that we have all this cool new tech, we need to build some graphics to experiment with it!  While we can't afford a real snow machine, virtual snow would be fun! (And less damaging to the artwork) We would like to develop a new set of broadcast graphics for the 2018 season that utilizes the new amazing power of our new graphics server. This will include a new intro, lower thirds (name plate) transition animation, and experimental interactive elements. This new system is capable of some really astounding interactive integration for our live stream events and we look forward to pushing these broadcast boundaries on YouTube in 2018.Phaze 7: Robocam Invasion (Overfund Goal 2)Like Tribbels, you can’t have just one… and who only wants one anyway! Klingons not withstanding. Bring on the ROBOT INVASION!We want Robocam 2 on both the left and right zoom angle shots. This way, we will never miss a close up and the color will perfectly match as well. Robcam 1 will be moved to the overhead allowing all our camera angles to be adjusted remotely.Community ResponsibilityWhen we started planning this project, our first objective was to be transparent in our goals and what we plan to do with the donations you provide us. And we are committed to continuing that transparency if we see success beyond our initial goals.With additional budget, we could choose a faster server, get a few more lights, and improve some of the choices we are making in the studio. We need a lot of basic things upgraded in the studio and a little extra capitol would go a long way to make that happen. Ranging from a new laser printer to both Cinnamon and John needing a good chair, we will keep everyone posted on how we use the funds to build our new community space. What about the SherpaMobile? We realized that before we could invest in our mobile broadcasting, we needed to get some of the basics in the main studio first. Once we get our studio secure, we will give her our full attention!CAN WE DO IT? YES WE CAN!It takes a Tribe.This project has been largely made possible because of our community members, patrons, and friends of The Sherpa who have stepped forward to help us. In order to build our new set, we need access to a complete wood and electrical workshop, along with the expertise needed to run it all. But as luck would have it, John's good friend Mike (a master carpenter) offered to build all the new sets in his workshop, come install it and rewire our studio, we just needed to get the materials! WOW!!! With an offer like that, we had to explore our options. After a talking to a few more friends, more offers of help and great deals on lights, cameras and servers to improve the studio started to emerge. We have done extensive research on each stage of our plan to make sure we can successfully execute each Phaze as we achieve that funding level. With this confluence of events, we realize now is the time to accept the loving offers of help, and take the Sherpa studio to the next level.Other Ways You Can HelpMany hands make for light work, and if you can’t contribute financially, THAT'S OK!  You can still help JUST by sharing this fundraiser on your social pages to get the word out in support of free art for everyone!

<h3><strong>How We Got Our Idea About Having No Idea</strong></h3>
<p>When you finally know what you want to do with your life but have no idea how to do it... When you figure out how you want to do it but the pandemic hits... When you say “screw it” and write a TV series over Zoom with your friends and it’s.. good... When you realize that shooting an entire season requires more capital than your scrappy indie productions are used to... When you know you’re going to make it happen, but HOW you will make it happen… you have no idea.</p>
<h3>What the Show's About</h3>
<p>Three queer roommates, all former 9-5er's in their early 30's have finally decided they want to pursue acting. But what does this mean?<strong> THEY HAVE NO IDEA.</strong></p>
<p>Gray, Melissa, and Lane have just landed in Atlanta to pursue their passion? Dream? Purpose? as actors and feel like they are starting over. This series is about the highs and lows of a creative career and not having any idea what you're doing in your 30's (aka when you're supposed to have it ""all figured out"".) The series consists of hijinks, struggles, fears, and working through lifelong conditioning to become the people they want to be, alongside new friends, and figuring it out on the way.</p>
<h3>Our Backstory </h3>
<p>""I Have No Idea” (IHNI) is a digital comedy series created by Shay Dominguez, Allyson Kloster, and Leslie Martinez, three actor-producers from Los Angeles who live in Atlanta. When we lost our jobs over the pandemic, we met weekly over Zoom to write season one (eight episodes). The writing sessions gave us hope, confidence, and a YOLO mentality, and our goal is to infuse the show with that spirit. </p>
<p>We've produced and financed over 30 comedic short films through Leslie and Ally's production company <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEFEb1qvQ25xTvTMvNcDY6g/videos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Supervāse Video</a>. But shooting an entire eight-episode season of a series requires more production costs and resources than we personally have access to. So we need your help! </p>
<p>We truly believe that no one has any idea what they’re doing, and that’s okay! It’s just about following your heart, listening to your inner voice, and despite the conditions of the world around you, continuing to chart your own path. Through this process, this is how things are created and how magic is made.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal of our campaign is to finance the production and post-production of our first season. The first season consists of 8 fully written episodes. Production expenses include our principal location (house) and key cast &amp; crew. Post-production expenses will go to hiring a quality editor. </p>
<p>The $25,000 we hope to raise will go directly to filming our first season (the S1 budget is over twice as much). <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622405117/qh0x3jonqul8xj7iwd9v.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A significant chunk of our money will go to the location fee of our principal location: the Queer House. Gray (Shay Dominguez), Lane (Allyson Kloster), and Melissa (Leslie Martinez), meet and become friends as new roommates in the Queer House. The house is not only a physical home base of the story, but an emotional home base for the characters as they live life together.</p>

<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We have a lot of great perks in store for you! We have perks ranging from $1 to $10,000! The reason for this is because we want people on the whole financial spectrum to be able to identify and be a part of our story in anyway, shape or form they can be (that means YOU, Mr. Moneybags!)</p>
<p>These are some of the perks we are most excited about: </p>
<ul>
<li>SWAG BAG! Which includes a t-shirt, a mug, a sticker, a magnet, a pin, and a tote bag! </li>
<li>Tarot Readings with Bandit The Oracle who has 15+ years of experience </li>
<li>A personalized postcard from Atlanta (where we are!)</li>
<li>New Moon Ritual for manifesting and intention setting with Leslie!</li>
<li>Personalized Painting of your favorite Pet or Human! </li>
<li>And last but not least, access to an exclusive Cast+Crew Zoom Watch Party (+ Swag Bag) where you can watch the first two episodes with the cast and crew before IHNI is even released! Q&amp;A w/ the creators before or after.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will reallocate funds to produce our first season on a micro-micro-micro-budget and skeleton crew (literally, just the three of us and a camera person, probably no food (DON’T LET US STARVE!)). While not ideal, we have done it before and we are determined to shoot this series no matter what.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We want to see and create a world in which being queer is just a part of the story and not what the whole story is about.</strong> We are in 2021 and queer shows are still not mainstream, and if they are, many of these stories are not being told by queer people. Frankly, being queer is still a “taboo” subject in many parts of the country. We want to normalize being queer and queer voices. We want to see queer people living their happy lives and being their best selves. <strong>We want to see queer people living happy lives and not be killed off at the end of a season. </strong></p>
<p>With your contribution, we will be able to film an entire first season of our newly created series and properly compensate people for their time. <strong>We will hire local Atlanta talent with a strong emphasis on BIPOC/AAPI and queer people, since these people are often overlooked in front of and behind the camera in the entertainment industry. </strong></p>
<p><i>Being POC and/or queer ourselves, we see it as our duty to provide opportunities for people like us, as we know how challenging it is to get through the door. We want to continue raising up diverse voices and telling these stories while compensating appropriately. </i></p>

<p>This campaign is specifically to fund the creation and outreach of our series pitch package.  Every great show has to start somewhere and we are currently in production on an exceptional project bible and killer trailer that serves as proof of value and concept for <i>Murder Lake</i>. Animation at this level is difficult, but your contribution, coupled with our talented and experienced team, allows us to build and share a strong series pitch package that is integral to selling the show.</p>
<p>I've pulled together a small but growing team to make Murder Lake a reality. As the team expands and strengthens, so does the project. This is an exciting part of the process and drives the success and personality of our series.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Craig Staggs and I am the Creative Director and co-founder of Minnow Mountain. We are an award-winning animation studio best known for our work on the documentary feature Tower. I served as Animation Directer and Co-Producer of Tower along with my partner, Steph Swope. We've also created an independent animated digital series called Earp. We are very excited to introduce our latest project: Murder Lake.

Murder Lake is a bloody memory. A dark and lush nightmare with environments steeped in atmosphere. Elaborate and striking painted backgrounds are adorned with dazzling effects of light, dust, weather, and wind. We’ll build an authentic horror story universe that stands in contrast to the hijinks and eccentricities of the characters inhabiting it.
This campaign is specifically to fund the creation and outreach of our series pitch package.  Every great show has to start somewhere and we are currently in production on an exceptional project bible and killer trailer that serves as proof of value and concept for Murder Lake. Animation at this level is difficult, but your contribution, coupled with our talented and experienced team, allows us to build and share a strong series pitch package that is integral to selling the show.
I've pulled together a small but growing team to make Murder Lake a reality. As the team expands and strengthens, so does the project. This is an exciting part of the process and drives the success and personality of our series.

CASTING UPDATE:
We are thrilled to announce the addition of Lee Eddy to the Murder Lake cast. Lee is an award winning actor and producer and it's an honor to work with her. She'll play the voice of Radio- Letty's ever present, all knowing, disembodied sidekick.

We're proud to announce the addition of Josephine Christiane McAdam to the Murder Lake Cast. Josephine's character will be featured in the pilot episode and the series trailer. More details soon.

Please consider joining the team with a contribution today!

<ul><li><h2>What is the show about?</h2></li></ul>
<p><br/>Joey is a Tai Chi instructor at a local public park when recently a group of LARPers (Live Action Role Players) have invaded his peaceful sanctuary. When their fantasy fighting scares off students and potential business, Joey has to take matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>He must join their make believe world, defeat the kingdom's greatest warriors, kill the king, and banish the LARPers from the Kingdom.<br/> </p>
<ul><li><h2>What's LARPing or whatever you call it...?</h2></li></ul>
<p><br/>I thought for a while on how to solve the problem of keeping a light-hearted martial arts series while maintaining <strong>tense, action-packed, plot driven fight scenes.<br/><br/>My answer: LARPing or Live Action Role Playing</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504046912/fb6cuv63vtqoxmcyu5us.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Basically, it's real life Dungeons and Dragons where you dress and act out the adventures of your characters. To a lot of people that have never tried either LARPing or D&amp;D, this might sound incredibly lame and geeky; and maybe some of you have seen a particular video of a kid throwing marshmallows yelling, ""Thunderbolt!,"" or that 8-bit sprite re-enacted skit of a group of guys playing D&amp;D on Youtube, which doesn't help the image of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>So, what if, these LARPers were actual AMAZING fighters that had to fight for their imaginary lives? </strong><br/><br/>Doesn't sound too lame now, right?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504047405/ixfs803lqsha0tzzw8mf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<ul><li><h2>Why we need your help</h2></li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>As a Youtube group, a project this size would be hard for us to tackle alone. So, we reached out for help and our cast and crew rose up to the challenge. Alongside them is Epic Armoury Unlimited, who graciously donated their amazing weapons for us to use; but we still found ourselves a bit short.</p>
<p>That's why we're here today to ask you all for your help.</p>
<p>To get straight to the point, we really need this money to get us over that last push to finishing the series. As you can see, we've been hard at work for this year to put together our biggest project yet, but even with all the help from family, friends, and our cast and crew; we still ran into unforeseen circumstances that lead us to the idea of crowdfunding our project.<br/> </p>
<ul><li><h2>So who's in the project?</h2></li></ul>
<p><br/>This project wouldn't have gotten off the ground without the participation of these amazing talents:</p>
<p><br/><strong>DL MacDonald</strong> - I've known this guy for a damn long while and still don't know what DL stands for but his performance in anything he does speaks for itself. A professional Canadian stuntman of the Eclipse Stunts, he also help train knights in Medieval Times in Toronto. Who else to be the King of the Kingdom if not him?</p>

<p><br/><strong>Brian Kuttel</strong> - So, to give you guys an idea of how long I've know this awesome dude...we met on Myspace. Not in a catfish way, but in a, ""HEY, YOU DO KUNG FU TOO!,"" kind of way, and we've become friends since. Brian, or should I say, Sifu Kuttel works out of San Francisco, training and teaching at the Doc-Fai Wong Martial Arts Center. He has a Youtube channel with videos that are designed to help students add depth to their training with supplementary exercises as well as forms and demonstration to show Choy Li Fut Kung Fu and Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan.</p>

<ul><li><h2><strong>The Final Pitch</strong></h2></li></ul>
<p>I hope that you guys can see how much passion and effort that is going into this project. Everything from its conception, story, the people in front of the camera and behind it, I took careful consideration with. I promise that if this project gets funded, I will give you, dear backers, the product that I know you would enjoy because it's something that I have enjoyed as a kid.</p>
<p>Martial art movies are an amazing and underestimated genre.<br/>It transcends language barriers and is enjoyed around the world because no matter what language you speak, a punch is a punch, a kick is a kick; but what I miss is the way that martial arts were presented back then. The trend is that the bloodier and grittier a fight scene goes, the more ""realistic"" it is.</p>
<p>I, for one, am not a badass, nor do I look like one. I can't pull off looking like Jason Bourne or movies like the Raid. I started filming with comedy and feel good movies, with martial arts as a good blend of action and visual comedy. Along the way, in my career and my path of being a filmmaker, I felt like I strayed away from what I really loved to do.<br/><br/>So now, I'm returning back to what I really love, with the people I love, for the people that love what we do.</p>
<p>This webseries is not only a tribute to my childhood heroes, but to my friends, and my love for making films. I want to share those smiles by making other people smile in the only way that I can.</p>
<p>So please, I hope you guys can open your hearts and your wallets and help me make an awesome action webseries with great characters, funny story, and a feel-good happy message.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

</div></div>","What is the show about?
Joey is a Tai Chi instructor at a local public park when recently a group of LARPers (Live Action Role Players) have invaded his peaceful sanctuary. When their fantasy fighting scares off students and potential business, Joey has to take matters into his own hands.He must join their make believe world, defeat the kingdom's greatest warriors, kill the king, and banish the LARPers from the Kingdom. 
What's LARPing or whatever you call it...?
I thought for a while on how to solve the problem of keeping a light-hearted martial arts series while maintaining tense, action-packed, plot driven fight scenes.My answer: LARPing or Live Action Role Playing

Basically, it's real life Dungeons and Dragons where you dress and act out the adventures of your characters. To a lot of people that have never tried either LARPing or D&D, this might sound incredibly lame and geeky; and maybe some of you have seen a particular video of a kid throwing marshmallows yelling, ""Thunderbolt!,"" or that 8-bit sprite re-enacted skit of a group of guys playing D&D on Youtube, which doesn't help the image of the scene.
So, what if, these LARPers were actual AMAZING fighters that had to fight for their imaginary lives? Doesn't sound too lame now, right?

 
Why we need your help
 
As a Youtube group, a project this size would be hard for us to tackle alone. So, we reached out for help and our cast and crew rose up to the challenge. Alongside them is Epic Armoury Unlimited, who graciously donated their amazing weapons for us to use; but we still found ourselves a bit short.
That's why we're here today to ask you all for your help.
To get straight to the point, we really need this money to get us over that last push to finishing the series. As you can see, we've been hard at work for this year to put together our biggest project yet, but even with all the help from family, friends, and our cast and crew; we still ran into unforeseen circumstances that lead us to the idea of crowdfunding our project. 
So who's in the project?
This project wouldn't have gotten off the ground without the participation of these amazing talents:
DL MacDonald - I've known this guy for a damn long while and still don't know what DL stands for but his performance in anything he does speaks for itself. A professional Canadian stuntman of the Eclipse Stunts, he also help train knights in Medieval Times in Toronto. Who else to be the King of the Kingdom if not him?

Please take a look at his reel as well, and ladies, don't fall too hard:


 

Brian Kuttel - So, to give you guys an idea of how long I've know this awesome dude...we met on Myspace. Not in a catfish way, but in a, ""HEY, YOU DO KUNG FU TOO!,"" kind of way, and we've become friends since. Brian, or should I say, Sifu Kuttel works out of San Francisco, training and teaching at the Doc-Fai Wong Martial Arts Center. He has a Youtube channel with videos that are designed to help students add depth to their training with supplementary exercises as well as forms and demonstration to show Choy Li Fut Kung Fu and Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan.

Check out his channel here!

 
Vincent Lyn - Can you believe I got this guy in my web series?! I grew up watching this guy! For those of you that might not know this legend, he has had a healthy career being on the big screen overseas! One of my most memorable childhood action movies is Operation Condor, where Vincent Lyn squared off with Jackie Chan himself! If we're going for a Hong Kong style martial arts action in this web series, might as well get someone who was a big and authentic part of that action genre!Watch a snippet of the amazing work done by Vincent Lyn!

And of course, Joey Min (Me) and Stephanie Pham of Art School Dropouts!

Well, if you guys want to know more about Steph and I, check out our Youtube channel!

I hope that you guys can see how much passion and effort that is going into this project. Everything from its conception, story, the people in front of the camera and behind it, I took careful consideration with.

<h3>My name is Anni and I am 21 years old, born and (still) living in Berlin. New queer but hella proud. </h3>
<p>Queermune is my little baby that I've been carrying around with me for a while.</p>
<p>But a few weeks ago I started to get more specific about it and started to search for a crew and wrote some stuff, like character breakdowns and a complete pilot.You will help me to raise money, so that I can really search for a crew and some more actors/ actresses. Also we have to pay locations, development stuff and of course my crew and the talents. Basically: You make my dream come true.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>We will need around 1000€, so that we can pay the crew, the talents, the locations, equipment and all the important stuff. We think about to found the rest (if there will be something left) for a good cause. </p>
<p>We will have a non-binary MALE character and lots of nationalities. I'll try to work with as much women as possible for the crew. I am queer myself and wrote the whole script, so far. That means representation from a queer person.</p>The rest of the money will goto a good cause, like mental health organizations. As I support them with an own website, trying to get more awareness for mental health issues.</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>With Queermune I'll try to show that a whole show can be based around a full queer ensemble. What does it mean to be queer, what are the challenges to come out to YOURSELF at first hand and so much more. Especially the male non-binary character is very important for me.</p>
<p>My biggest role model ist the webseries Carmella on KindaTV. It would be a dream come true, if Queermune get's only half of the recognition that Carmella gets. But I think they've work so hard to make it possible, so I'll do the same.</p>
<p>I promise there will be a lot of queer stuff. You'll see diverse people and REAL people, they won't be perfect, because nobody is. And their lives won't be perfect, but they handle their lives with humor, love, friendship, empathy and by just being human. Like you and me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Yeah, this project and idea seems heavy, because it is. It's my first try, but I am ready to take all the challenges to create an amazing show, that a lot of people can relate to. One challenge could be to don't get a crew, well I've a camera and if everything goes wrong I'll do it myself with the help and support of friends. What if there isn't enough money? Well I was never afraid to work more and more for my dreams, but then it'll take much longer. I am ready to face those challenges and I am ready to solve them, with you guys by my side :)</p>

<h3>Awoken TV: The Video Subscription Platform for Spiritual Media!</h3>

<p>For 10 years, I've been involved in the field of spirituality, consciousness, the psychic field, channeling and metaphysical research. I've worked with many thousands of clients from all over the world since 2008, and my greatest passion is to create a powerful video subscription platform that helps to both educate and entertain us through spiritual-themed shows, films, documentaries and courses!</p>
<p>We are going through intense changes upon the planet, and what I've discovered that people require most is spiritual support and community that's there for them. This is the life blood behind Awoken.TV. Not only will we have incredible spiritual content, but we're going to build a community where we can all help each other and learn about ourselves through the content we create.</p>

<li>Our goal is to raise $5000 to fulfill our start up cost to creating our integrated app so that Awoken.TV can be available on Roku, Amazon FireTV, iOS, Android, Apple TV and other common platforms. This will bring us a global audience as our teachers present their original content to a worldwide stage.</li>
<li>Once our startup goal is met, everything else is taken care of as our video on demand partner platform, Intelivideo will be working with us to create a powerful video subscription website.

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Teachers!</h3>

After the completion of our startup campaign, we will be rolling out our Awoken TV Teacher Training website where you can learn how to create original content for Awoken TV and get paid for it! Our training follows how to create professional media and also allows you to submit ideas for the series, documentary, film, online course or livestream show that you would like to create. All of our submissions are screened and if they pass the requirements for professional quality, your content will be available to our members from all over the world!</p>
<p>Best of all is the payout system for our teachers. Not only do our teachers have a discount rate to access Awoken.TV, but 50% of our monthly net profit goes towards our teachers through a revenue-per-minute payout system. In other words, the more watch time your content receives on Awoken.TV, the large your monthly payout. This is an incentive that we are pleased to offer our teachers who are passionate in creating premium content for our platform!</p>
<h3>Development Window Timeline</h3>
<p><strong>DECEMBER 2018:</strong> Begin Startup campaign to complete development for our Awoken.TV app integration. Assemble the full team to begin development of the Awoken TV platform and media management.</p>
<p><strong>JANUARY 2019:</strong> Complete Awoken TV teacher training website and recruit teachers to create original video content and/or submit produced documentaries/films to be aired on Awoken TV.</p>

Awoken.TV is people powered and we listen to our subscribers. Our subscribers are our family and we want your voice to be heard.

This is what stands Awoken.TV apart from any other video on demand platform. We are subscriber powered!</p>
<h3>The Topics We Cover</h3>
<p>Awoken.TV's goal is to become the most informative and topic-diverse video on demand platform online. Every topic that exists within spirituality, consciousness, self-awareness, metaphysics, truth-seeking, enlightenment and inner development will be a goal set to be covered by our teachers. And of course, we work with the feedback from our subscriber community to continue to stretch the coverage of topics we intend to cover.</p>
<h3>Device Friendly</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545263520/fw6tcxt4ee8sftcl3nzm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Live Events</h3>
<p>Awoken.TV will include live-streaming shows and classrooms. We will also be working to host in-person events between late 2019 to early 2020. We'll be keeping all of our subscribers updated on venues as we host events with our teachers so we can meet our Awoken TV family in-person!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Crowdfund the Startup Campaign?</h3>
<p>This is to show that Awoken.TV is supported by our subscribers. By helping us to achieve the startup cost, we  are making our platform a community-based website with passionate supporters who want to see Awoken.TV goes as far as it's own team wants it to. With your help, this will help us to get off the ground quicker and begin creating a video on demand platform like no other.</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Yes, creating a platform such as this takes a great deal of effort and a lot of time and money. Fortunately, we have an excellent partner platform behind the scenes that will help us with a great deal of behind the scenes work and full subscriber support. So a great deal of the behind the scenes management will be taken care of. And our growing team will be handling a great deal of the submitted media as we work to bring as much content to Awoken.TV upon our public launch in the spring. </p>
<h3>How Else Can You Help?</h3>
<p>Spread the word about Awoken.TV by visiting our Facebook page: facebook.com/AwokenTV as well as sharing our Indiegogo campaign page far and wide. The more subscribers that can come aboard Awoken.TV, the further we can reach out across a global stage to provide spiritual-themed content for everyone!</p>

Whether you want to watch Awoken.TV on your phone, tablet, computer or TV, we got you covered. Awoken.TV will be a fully functional integrated web app and will work pretty much anywhere.
Live Events
Awoken.TV will include live-streaming shows and classrooms. We will also be working to host in-person events between late 2019 to early 2020. We'll be keeping all of our subscribers updated on venues as we host events with our teachers so we can meet our Awoken TV family in-person!

Why Crowdfund the Startup Campaign?
This is to show that Awoken.TV is supported by our subscribers. By helping us to achieve the startup cost, we  are making our platform a community-based website with passionate supporters who want to see Awoken.TV goes as far as it's own team wants it to. With your help, this will help us to get off the ground quicker and begin creating a video on demand platform like no other.
Risks and Challenges
Yes, creating a platform such as this takes a great deal of effort and a lot of time and money. Fortunately, we have an excellent partner platform behind the scenes that will help us with a great deal of behind the scenes work and full subscriber support. So a great deal of the behind the scenes management will be taken care of. And our growing team will be handling a great deal of the submitted media as we work to bring as much content to Awoken.TV upon our public launch in the spring. 
How Else Can You Help?
Spread the word about Awoken.TV by visiting our Facebook page: facebook.com/AwokenTV as well as sharing our Indiegogo campaign page far and wide. The more subscribers that can come aboard Awoken.TV, the further we can reach out across a global stage to provide spiritual-themed content for everyone!

<h2>THE CAMPAIGN VIDEO</h2>
<p>Instead of filming a video where we tell you what style of web series we want to create, we decided to just show you. In order to secure a slot as a Resident Assistant, candidates must interview for the job. This video is a sneak peak at what to expect from this web series.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>THIS PROJECT</h2>
<p>When living in on-campus housing, there is a fine line between order and chaos. The dedicated students who protect this fine line are members of an elite squad known as Resident Assistants. These are their stories. A new web series about RAs: written, produced, and starring real life RAs. Join the absurd and satirical life of being an RA, through the eyes of RAs who are surprised they've made it out alive. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></h2>
<p>Comedy is the best source of medicine. Whether you're stressing out about how you're going to pay rent, juggling being a full-time student and a part-time worker, while still trying to keep your creative juices flowing. It can be a lot to handle. No one knows this more than RAs. Instead of dwelling on the stresses of life and confining our creativity, we want to create a story that takes a satirical and comedic look at the life of RAs. Some of us are nearing the end of our college and RA careers, so we want to go off with a bang. Please support, share, and donate to help us to create something we can be proud of.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THE CHALLENGES- How can you help?</h2>
<p>The goal is to produce 8 episodes for this web series throughout the next few months. Our story requires that we have proper equipment, scenic elements, production resources, etc. Listed below is where your money will go!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to rent camera equipment and lighting equipment.</li>
<li>We must provide reimbursement for transportation, parking, and gas of equipment and crew.</li>
<li>We are providing 1 meal a day for the student-based crew, dietary restrictions are taken into account. </li>
<li>We’re going green! We want the set to have as little waste as possible and that means purchasing recyclable materials and organizing, recycling, and reusing efforts. </li>
<li>Copyright and WGA registration fees. </li>

<h3>DATE ME</h3>
<p><strong>Date Me</strong> tells the stories of Kristin's crazy family; the unique and often lousy ways people interact with her because of her disability; and her attempts, often failed or funny, at dating in a wheelchair with a strained, but ongoing determination not to give up. The opportunity to create a series inspired by <i>Date Me</i> will create inspired family-friendly entertainment and allow us to share in moments based on Kristin's dating experiment— 32 dates in 75 days.</p>
<p><strong>Kristin Beale:</strong> I'm young, single, and in a wheelchair due to a jet ski accident in the ninth grade. In most people's minds, my wheelchair seems to define me; people are either scared of it or think it's a bigger deal than it is. But I'm just a normal girl. I'm a young, single woman who happens to be sitting down.</p>
<p><strong>David Leehy: </strong>I'm an actor, director and scriptwriter. I've done everything from professional wrestling production to acting in Spielburg's Lincoln. I'm a proud grandfather and RV enthusiast who wants to bring Kristin's Date Me concept to the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Tyler Darden:</strong> I'm a cinematographer and commercial photographer, dad and wakeboarder. I love to work with cameras, lenses and lighting to help make each story beautiful, compelling and unique.</p>

<li>An opportunity to come on set and be an extra in the pilot.</li>

Date Me tells the stories of Kristin's crazy family; the unique and often lousy ways people interact with her because of her disability; and her attempts, often failed or funny, at dating in a wheelchair with a strained, but ongoing determination not to give up. The opportunity to create a series inspired by Date Me will create inspired family-friendly entertainment and allow us to share in moments based on Kristin's dating experiment— 32 dates in 75 days.
Kristin Beale: I'm young, single, and in a wheelchair due to a jet ski accident in the ninth grade. In most people's minds, my wheelchair seems to define me; people are either scared of it or think it's a bigger deal than it is. But I'm just a normal girl. I'm a young, single woman who happens to be sitting down.
David Leehy: I'm an actor, director and scriptwriter. I've done everything from professional wrestling production to acting in Spielburg's Lincoln. I'm a proud grandfather and RV enthusiast who wants to bring Kristin's Date Me concept to the screen.
Tyler Darden: I'm a cinematographer and commercial photographer, dad and wakeboarder. I love to work with cameras, lenses and lighting to help make each story beautiful, compelling and unique.

Funding Goals
To cover costs of producing this pilot, $4000:

We are working with experienced actors and are keeping our production within guidelines outlined by the Screen Actors Guild.
We need more resources to keep the crew and actors safeguarded against Covid-19.
We have to pay fees for permits and permission to film at two of our four locations.
Our talented and hardworking crew will be paid to make this story shine on screen
We are using this pilot to pitch different outlets for additional funding to produce up to six episodes for season one.

Perks! Partnering with us you can choose one or more of these:

A signed copy of one of Kristin's books, Date Me, Greater Things or A Million Suns.

A Date Me t-shirt!
An invitation to an early screening of the pilot and provide input on the final edit.
An opportunity to visit the set as a guest producer and have lunch with the cast and crew.
An opportunity to come on set and be an extra in the pilot.
We hope to reach stretch goals and have an animated introduction using Kristin's drawings, bring in additional resources for wardrobe and set decorating. Additionally we would love to be able to have more crew for editing, coloring and sound in post-production.
we have a flexible goal, so even if we fall short of our stated goal, all funds will go toward the production and add to money already committed.


Our Impact
Your contribution will make a difference:

Help us bring Kristin's story, humor and poignancy to screens everywhere
Be a part of our mission to help many to see the challenges of being in a wheelchair and living life to its fullest.
We have over 60 years combined experience as writers, actors and filmmakers.
David Leehy has worked in large and small productions all around the mid-Atlantic.
Tyler Darden owns SaltFire Studio, a film and photo production company in Richmond, Va.
This is our third production together. We finished filming Everything But You in March (to premiere in November 2020) and premiered There's An App for That in May,


 

Risks & Challenges
While we hope we don't see setbacks, we must address as many as possible in preparation

Covid-19 restrictions could shut down production. If so, we will reschedule for a later date.
We will have a plan in place to keep the set clean with minimal interactions between departments.

From Miss Cleo, to John Edwards and Sylvia Brown, psychics often reach fame of extraordinary heights due to humanity’s fascination with the parapsychological. But what do Claire and Ruby, a couple of jaded and broke millennial women, do when they have a problem? They become psychics.</p><p>CLAIREvoyant is a mystical comedy of errors starring a classic odd-couple duo. In this episodic digital series, co-creators and co-stars Annie Briggs (Ruby) and Natasha Negovanlis (Claire) play two sincere and relatable leads that are body positive, sex positive, and unafraid to be themselves. It is a feminist comedy/fantasy series for those that love the colourful kinetics of Chewing Gum, the bare-souled honesty of Fleabag, and the queer-positivity of Please Like Me. The tone of our storytelling is a fusion of grounded and genuine scenes about reluctant and painful personal growth, with absurdist humour. </p><p><i>This is what it’s all about…</i></p><p><u><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501269720/fda9ibu7zzgu7eccl4bs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></u><br/><br/>Aimless and hung-over, Claire and Ruby wake up under an overpass after partying away their last 50 bucks on Claire’s 25th birthday, and find out they are evicted.

Hi, WELCOME to our IndieGoGo donation page for our original Web Series, BRAINDEAD.
We are a group of young actors and media artists who are excited and passionate about creating work for ourselves, and creating the type of content that we are interested in watching. 
Last year we shot a short film with a budget of 0 dollars, and while we are very proud of the product we hope to accomplish something a bit grander with our next project BRAINDEAD.
 

Our Proposal
We are partnering our next project with the Screen Actor Guild and working with dozens of young, talented, passionate artists. Because we are committed to keeping our work to a level we can be proud to show you, we need help funding our project. All of the money you donate will go directly into the project either through paying the actors and artists for their work or through buying equipment, materials, and the various physical elements that make a film set run. 

For a 5$ donation we will take down your name and thank you in the credits of a BRAINDEAD episode
For a donation of 10$ or more we will personally send you the soundtrack to our first project After Party, featuring

<p>The television adaptation for this highly acclaimed literary work is rooted in the history of Séliš (Salish) storytelling. 14,000 years ago, when the Séliš began to inhabit the<br/>ancestral homeland, now known as the Bitterroot Valley and Flathead Reservation,<br/>Salish languages, songs, and narratives were heard across the land before the sea of<br/>colonization threatened to drown Salish voices and traditions. We hope Perma Red will<br/>ignite a new generation of Selis and Native storytelling.</p>

<p><i>Perma Red</i>, based on the award-winning novel by Séliš author Debra Magpie Earling, brings to life the story of a young Séliš woman, Louise White Elk.  Smart, strong, and beautiful, Louise plays pranks, challenges boys and men to race her, breaks horses, dives in the dangerous waters of the Flathead River, saves her sisters from BIA officials, and lives as a free spirit in a world that denies Indians freedom.  </p>
<p>A 2011 Statistics Canada report estimates that Indigenous women are seven times more likely than other women to be victims of a homicide. Murdered and missing Indigenous women is a story as old as Lewis and Clark and now that terrible story is epidemic.</p>
<p>In reclaiming our stories, Natives are able to give a voice to those that have for too long been voiceless in the mainstream. Call it the decolonization of the arts, because through art and film we have the ability to change lives and influence society, but change can only occur through authenticity and respect.</p>

<p>Native stories, language, tradition, and knowledge have been extracted and exploited<br/>like all of our resources. This is the unfortunate legacy of colonization.</p>
<p>But storytelling decolonizes.</p>
<p>When we tell our own stories; we reclaim our stories.<br/>We change lives through art and film.<br/>We give voice to the voiceless.<br/>Decolonization of the Arts begins with the original people.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534278192/bjzuikcqjo7znr259yva.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Storytelling ignites the fire colonization wanted to extinguish.</strong></p>
<p><i>Perma Red</i> is building an infrastructure to promote Native Storytelling for years to come. With issues like Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and suicide reaching epidemic proportions in Indian Country, Natives across the United States need to come together to find solutions. </p>
<p>Perma Red as a limited television series will be more than entertainment, it will be a viable job resource for the Mission Valley and Flathead Indian Reservation and will have ⅔ crew ratio of Native to White to honor Indigenous filmmaking. The script will include Salish dialogue, and there’s a need for crew, dancers, singers, cast, and consultants to ensure cultural sensitivity and accuracy. With the success of the series, more film projects would create financially viable jobs on and off the reservations honoring and encouraging the voice of culture through storytelling.</p>
<p>In an area wrought with high suicide rates, seeing an entire community unite behind the series will instill a sense of local and tribal pride and hope that cannot be understated. Their humanity, their struggles, and their hardships finally matter to a seemingly indifferent world. Elders and little kids alike proud they are part of a movie about where they live who they are, because through art, through literature, through film, they mattered.</p>
<h2><i>Mentorship</i></h2>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534351465/a2pzir9sarq2drzxkj8v.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p>We are also working with Salish Kootenai College to incorporate mentor programs for Native American youth to learn about working on a set as a director, producer, writer and personal assistant. In that, <i>Perma Red</i> is comprised of a crew of a highly accomplished women and men of their respective fields encompassing above-the-line roles from directing to producing—50% of whom are Native women. These statistics—unheard of on a production set—create an environment of passionate, collaborative, and progressive filmmaking. Not only does this provide an avenue and safe space to exercise the female gaze, it also creates a process of female-led mentorship and shared vision sorely needed in the cinematic world of today with the reality of #MeToo plaguing the industry. We can simultaneously lift women up in film and stimulate the creation of long term professional jobs in Montana and on the reservation for them.  </p>
<p>Finally, by addressing the serious and relevant issue of missing and murdered indigenous women through the true story it’s based upon, we will give national platform to the #MMIW movement. We are working closely with Debra Magpie Earling and an elder cultural counsel to tell this story with integrity and respect. We intend to bring awareness by honoring Séliš, Ql̓ispé  people while giving a voice to missing and murdered Native women whose voices we must always listen to and never forget.</p>
<p>We believe this series will further heal relationships internationally through the arts via the transcendent and universal language of literature and film, and will do so from the beautiful canvas called Western Montana, ntxʷetkʷ.</p>
<h2><i><strong>Ensuring Authenticity</strong></i></h2>
<p>We honor the significance of cultural authenticity in all of its facets and strive to ensure<br/>sensitivity and protection. Séliš dialogue is a necessary element of the production and<br/>we wish to bring awareness to the Sélis language which is now critically endangered.</p>
<h2><strong>Staying True to Tribal Sovereignty</strong></h2>
<p>The series will be shot on location on the visually stunning Flathead Indian Reservation<br/>in Montana, a site that is deeply connected to Séliš culture.</p>

<p><strong>Lauren Evans </strong>(<i>Producer</i>) - It is said that Lauren is good at many things... unfortunately writing a witty bio about herself is not one of those things. When she's not stressing over what to say about herself on the internet she is helping to bring amazing stories to life with a spectacular group of friends and colleagues.  She can't wait to put her non-bio writing skills to good use making the second season of A4O the best one yet!</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Shelson</strong> (<i>Writer, Producer</i>) - Sarah loves having many hats both actual and metaphorically. Her other roles on All For One have included Official Button Pusher, Official Inseparables Cue-er &amp; Official Mom-Van Driver. Her hats include a Gryffindor toque, a Jayne knit hat and an uber-comfortable Cherrydale snapback.</p>
<p><strong>Wil Noack</strong> (<i>Editor) - </i>Wil's favourite pastimes are editing, gaming, and working with Team Cherrydale on making a second season of All For One come to life. (Oh, and editing those glitches in season one, making everyone think it was their internet taking intermittent nose-dives. #sorrynotsorry).</p>
<p><strong>RJ Lackie </strong>(<i>Writer</i>) - RJ is... very tired. In the past two years, he's done some combination of creating, writing and/or producing on web series like Inhuman Condition, All For One, Couple-ish, The Soliloquies of Santiago, and IRL: The Series, as well as his first produced feature film, Darken. His next great adventures are psychological thriller web series Riding Hood and - hopefully!! - All For One season two. What? We said the guy was tired! RJ is online at Twitter (@rjlackie).</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Litt </strong>(<i>Director</i>) - Shannon’s passion for directing started at a tender young age when she wrangled the kids in her townhouse complex to perform an original (somewhat disastrous) rendition of 'The Velveteen Rabbit'. Her storytelling skills have slightly improved since then and she’s proud to revive her role as director for an epic Season 2 of A4O! (She's  spent the past 2 years obsessing over A4O tumblr posts and trying to convince writers Sarah &amp; RJ to revive Portiana &lt;3)</p>
<p><strong>And over 20 other hardworking crew members at all stages of production!</strong></p>

<p>We want to give you everything we have planned for season two because it's super awesome stuff! But all that awesomeness needs to be paid for. Here's where all of your generously donated money towards a second season will go:</p>
<p><strong>Crew:</strong> Team work makes the dream work! We're lucky to be working with such incredible people who have already devoted so much of their time and hard work to A4O. To make the second season of All For One just as great (and then some) as the first, we'll need our team back to pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>Cast</strong>: All For One just isn't All For One without the characters we've come to know and love. Our wonderful cast has given it their all to make the characters everything they are today, and we'd love for them to come back and continue bringing them to life. On top of that, we're introducing three brand-new on-screen characters who will also need to be compensated for their awesome acting efforts!</p>
<p><strong>Production</strong>:  Lights, camera... and so much more! To make All For One look and sound as good as it does, we need to rent out a LOT of equipment, and as a result, buy a LOT of insurance. On top of that, production costs include wardrobe, props and locations. Oh, and we can't forget food and coffee - the life force behind any production (seriously, go ask any production).</p>
<p>Did we mention a Live Episode? 'Cause should funding go through, that's definitely going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong>: Where would All For One be if no one knew about it? Making the world aware of A4O takes a lot of research, time and effort, and for season two, we intend to make our reach larger than ever. This also includes costs that go towards award applications, to have our little show recognized by the big film &amp; television community... which will hopefully lead to creating more shows for you in the future! </p>
<p><strong>Just In Case</strong>: We'll be completely up-front with you. Managing a production budget may not be rocket-science, but it's an incredible amount of work, and almost 100% of the time, unforeseen costs come up. Contingency is vital to every project, and ends up going towards making the show the best it can be at the end of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdfund</strong>: Yes, this campaign alone costs money to run! Additionally, IndieGoGo takes a total of 8-10% in processing fees to help themselves run, which is totally understandable.</p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong>: From the bottom of our hearts, we appreciate any contribution you are able to make towards bringing a second season of All For One to life. Take it from us - we want to make it just as much as you want to see it. So any and all contributions are appreciated by the entire crew here at Cherrydale Productions. As far as we're concerned, you're just as much a part of the team.</p>

In Season One we followed Dorothy on her quest for love, friends & the sorority of her dreams. However, brash Dorothy quickly found herself mixed up with a corrupt student government that threatened to tear her new life apart.
Season Two picks up in Dorothy's second semester at Dumas College. Having achieved everything she set out to, Dorothy is now looking to leave her mark. With the sorority president election splitting her friends into opposing sides, the group must compete while keeping their friendships intact.

Unfortunately all of the above costs money. We've pulled favours everywhere we can and that has helped the budget ENORMOUSLY, but we still need to cover location, art/prop/costume materials, equipment and editing costs, plus a small token payment for each of our hardworking crew.
 
Why the ruddy hell should I part with my hard earned cash to make this?

The script is hilarious.
Jordan and Stephen are hilarious.
The writer, director and producer are female, independent filmmakers at the beginning of their careers. 
There aren't enough trans women in film, especially comedy. 
Why the ruddy hell not?

 
Other ways to help

We kindly ask if people could please get the word out and make some noise about this crowdfunder online and in real life with actual humans and that. It would really help so much.

<p>¡Hola a todos! Nosotros somos Alba Téllez y Luigi Rodríguez. Nos encontramos aquí para mostrarles un nuevo proyecto que tenemos entre manos. Esta historia comenzó a escribirse a principios del 2014, y ahora que la tenemos finalizada, queremos sacarla a la luz.</p>
<p>Cuenta la historia de dos amigas, Rosa y Ana, que llevan vidas muy diferentes pero unidas por los problemas que han ido superando en su día a día. Pero cuando parece que consiguen medio estabilizarse, aparecen personas que les alteran sus vidas y las ponen en alerta las 24 horas.</p>
<p><strong><i><u>Nuestra historia:</u></i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508592396/negdyv6rsg6ywwjns7iw.jpg"" src=""""/></u></i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rosa</strong> es una chica de clase social media-baja que vive sola en un pequeño apartamento. Su padre, <strong>Luis</strong>, es un borracho que ha estado en la cárcel por haber matado a su madre, <strong>Amalia</strong>, una noche de borrachera y que sigue molestando a su hija tras salir con la condicional. Rosa se gana la vida escribiendo guiones de historias que les envían otros escritores, así como corregirlas, en una empresa llamada “HISTORY”.</p>
<p><strong>Minho</strong> es un surcoreano militar que tuvo que huir de Corea del Sur porque un día descubrió a su superior hablando con un jefe militar de Corea del Norte, planeando una redada contra Corea del Sur y traicionando así a su país. Minho le amenazó con decirlo todo, así que cuando fue a su casa, vio a sus padres y a su hermana menor muertos de manos de militares y de su superior. Así que huyó a España sin saber hablar el idioma español, sin trabajo y sin hogar. Allí, planea su venganza.</p>
<p>En España, Minho y Rosa se conocen de una forma muy peculiar, provocando que, a pesar de los “choques” entre ambos, acaben viviendo bajo el mismo techo. Rosa le enseña a hablar y escribir español, y Minho le enseña cosas de su cultura, lo que lleva a enamorarse el uno de otro.</p>
<p>Pero las cosas comienzan a complicarse cuando <strong>Clara</strong>, la peor enemiga de Rosa, intenta cautivar a Minho, haciendo todo lo posible para separarlos, además de la aparición repentina de <strong>Carlos</strong>, un ex novio de Rosa, quien quiere volver con ella haciendo cualquier cosa sin importarle las consecuencias.</p>
<p>Por otro lado tenemos a <strong>Ana</strong>, la mejor amiga de Rosa. Es dueña de una cafetería, una soltera treintañera. Ana esconde un triste pasado que comienza a revelarse cuando aparece <strong>Andrés</strong>, el mejor amigo de Ana que desapareció un día y que aparece 23 años después, pero Ana no lo reconoce…</p>
<p>Andrés, adoptado por una familia rica cuando tenía 8 años. Dueño de una marca de vinos con gran influencia internacional. Era muy amigo de Ana desde los 2 años, ya que vivían juntos en un orfanato. A los 8 años se fue a EEUU con sus padres adoptivos, lo que hizo que Andrés perdiera todo contacto con sus amigos españoles. Vuelve silenciosamente a España años más tarde para recuperar lo que perdió de niño.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>LA IMPORTANCIA DE NUESTRA CAMPAÑA</strong></u></h3>
<p><strong>ALBA: </strong></p>
<p>La idea de crear esta historia ha surgido a partir de mis experiencias vividas en Corea del Sur y del trato que tengo a diario con personas que viven en el país. He vivido en Corea del sur, he aprendido el idioma y he trabajo allí, por lo que conozco la situación actual del país y el conflicto que existe entre el Sur y el Norte debido a la dictadura del general Kim Jong Un y de las continuas amenazas de guerra y bombas que mantienen en alerta a los ciudadanos sur coreanos y al ejército, estando en continuo entrenamiento y obligando a los hombres, a partir de cierta edad, 2 años de milicia, además de cada cierto tiempo ir al ejército 3 días para un entrenamiento de “recordatorio”.</p>
<p>¿Y por qué el personaje coreano decide venir a España? A la gente de Corea le encanta nuestro país; continuamente vemos coreanos que vienen de vacaciones, canciones con palabras en nuestro idioma, incluso hay series y películas coreanas cuyas producciones las han traído a España para grabar algunas escenas. Hablamos de series muy famosas en el país como: The K2 (grabaron en Barcelona) o Leyenda del mar azul (en Galicia), entre otras, además de programas de TV y documentales<i>.</i></p>
<p>Tras esta situación, y debido a que estamos en España, quise plasmar en mi historia una mezcla de culturas que provocan situaciones de comedia y de drama entre sus protagonistas, con el objetivo de divertir al espectador, a la vez que se enganche a la historia de sus personajes, pudiendo llegar a verse reflejados, en cierto modo, en ellos.</p>
<p>Antes de lanzarme a publicar mi historia, decidí enseñársela a varias personas, tanto relacionadas con el mundo del cine como no; sus opiniones positivas y sus frases tipo “Me he enamorado de tal personaje”, “¿Tienes más capítulos? Me has enganchado”, “¡Vaya! No sabía que la cultura coreana era así. ¡Me encanta la historia!” o “Enhorabuena Alba, me encantaría que sacaras el proyecto adelante. No me esperaba que la historia fuese así” son las que me dieron el empujón a querer llevar esta historia a la pantalla y que todo el mundo pudiera disfrutar de ella y, paralelamente, aprender una cultura nueva.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>CON VUESTRA AYUDA, TODO ES POSIBLE</strong></u></h3>
<p>Como sabréis, el mundo del artista es muy duro. Conseguir un trabajo o sacar un proyecto adelante está sólo a manos de unos pocos privilegiados, ya sea por su status social, sus conexiones o su lugar de residencia. Pero gracias a las campañas crowdfunding, hay mucha gente que puede dar a luz grandes ideas que no deben quedarse en un cajón.</p>
<p>Financiar un proyecto no es fácil, por eso, la mínima ayuda que cada uno aporte supone un empujón muy grande para todos nosotros.</p>
<p>Queremos mostrar al país una nueva forma de contar historias, queremos llevar a la pantalla algo diferente a lo que solemos ver; algo que nos haga reír, que nos ponga en tensión, que nos transmita nostalgia... Queremos una historia que nos ponga todos nuestros sentimientos a flor de piel, que podamos llegar a sentirnos identificados con algunos de los personajes y, al mismo tiempo, aprendamos cosas nuevas de una cultura tan excepcional y diferente como es la coreana.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>FINANCIACIÓN Y RECOMPENSAS</span></u></p>
</div><div>
<p>Como hemos comentado, llevar un proyecto a la pantalla no es fácil, ¡y mucho menos económico! Hay que cubrir gastos de todo tipo: catering, vestuario y atrezzo, material audiovisual, transporte, estancia, alquiler de localizaciones, seguros, posibles gastos médicos (recemos por que no sean necesarios nunca, pero ha de haber una parte reservada para ello), y un sin fín de cosas más necesarias para llevar a cabo el rodaje.</p>
<p>Realmente, es necesario una gran cantidad de dinero, pero hemos reducido a lo mínimo que necesitamos, llegando a la cantidad de 5.500 €. Ese dinero irá destinado a todo lo comentado en el párrafo anterior, así como a poder distribuir el capítulo piloto (capítulo 1), que será el que rodaremos. Para ello, contamos con la ayuda de todos vosotros.</p>
<p>Pero la ayuda no queda sólo en ayuda. ¡Os recompensaremos por ello! Tenemos un montón de sorpresas y regalos que os esperan.</p>

<p>Here's the synopsis:</p>
<p><strong>Rosa</strong> is a middle-low class girl living alone in a small apartment. His father, <strong>Luis</strong>, is a drunk man who has been in jail for killing his mother, <strong>Amalia</strong>, a night of drunkenness and who continues to molest his daughter after leaving on parole.

<p>In Spain, Minho and Rosa are known in a very peculiar way, causing that, despite the ""clashes"" between both, end up living under the same roof. Rosa teaches him to speak and write Spanish, and Minho teaches her the korean culture, which leads to falling in love with each other.</p>
<p>But things begin to get complicated when <strong>Clara</strong>, Rosa's worst enemy, tries to captivate Minho, doing everything possible to separate them, in addition to the sudden appearance of <strong>Carlos</strong>, an ex-boyfriend of Rosa who wants to date her again, doing anything without mind the consequences.</p>
<p>On the other hand we have <strong>Ana</strong>, Rosa's best friend. She owns a coffee shop, a single thirties.

<p>Andrés, adopted by a wealthy family when he was 8 years old. Owner of a brand of wines with great international influence. He had been close friends with Ana since the age of two, since they lived together in an orphanage. At age 8 he went to the United States with his adoptive parents, which caused Andrés to lose all contact with his Spanish friends. He returns silently to Spain years later to recover what he lost when he was a child.</p>

LA IMPORTANCIA DE NUESTRA CAMPAÑA
ALBA: 
La idea de crear esta historia ha surgido a partir de mis experiencias vividas en Corea del Sur y del trato que tengo a diario con personas que viven en el país. He vivido en Corea del sur, he aprendido el idioma y he trabajo allí, por lo que conozco la situación actual del país y el conflicto que existe entre el Sur y el Norte debido a la dictadura del general Kim Jong Un y de las continuas amenazas de guerra y bombas que mantienen en alerta a los ciudadanos sur coreanos y al ejército, estando en continuo entrenamiento y obligando a los hombres, a partir de cierta edad, 2 años de milicia, además de cada cierto tiempo ir al ejército 3 días para un entrenamiento de “recordatorio”.
¿Y por qué el personaje coreano decide venir a España? A la gente de Corea le encanta nuestro país; continuamente vemos coreanos que vienen de vacaciones, canciones con palabras en nuestro idioma, incluso hay series y películas coreanas cuyas producciones las han traído a España para grabar algunas escenas. Hablamos de series muy famosas en el país como: The K2 (grabaron en Barcelona) o Leyenda del mar azul (en Galicia), entre otras, además de programas de TV y documentales.

Me has enganchado”, “¡Vaya! No sabía que la cultura coreana era así. ¡Me encanta la historia!” o “Enhorabuena Alba, me encantaría que sacaras el proyecto adelante. No me esperaba que la historia fuese así” son las que me dieron el empujón a querer llevar esta historia a la pantalla y que todo el mundo pudiera disfrutar de ella y, paralelamente, aprender una cultura nueva.

Rosa works writing scripts of stories sent to her by other writers, as well as correcting them, in a company called ""HISTORY"".
Minho is a South Korean military man who had to flee South Korea because one day he discovered his superior talking to a North Korean military chief, planning a raid on South Korea and thus betraying his country. Minho threatened to say everything, so when he went to his house, he saw his parents and his younger sister killed by the military and his superior. So he fled to Spain without knowing how to speak the Spanish language, without work and homeless. There, he plan the revenge.
In Spain, Minho and Rosa are known in a very peculiar way, causing that, despite the ""clashes"" between both, end up living under the same roof. Rosa teaches him to speak and write Spanish, and Minho teaches her the korean culture, which leads to falling in love with each other.
But things begin to get complicated when Clara, Rosa's worst enemy, tries to captivate Minho, doing everything possible to separate them, in addition to the sudden appearance of Carlos, an ex-boyfriend of Rosa who wants to date her again, doing anything without mind the consequences.
On the other hand we have Ana, Rosa's best friend. She owns a coffee shop, a single thirties. Ana hides a sad past that begins to reveal itself when Andrés appears, Ana's best friend who disappeared one day and appears 23 years later, but Ana does not recognize him...
Andrés, adopted by a wealthy family when he was 8 years old. Owner of a brand of wines with great international influence. He had been close friends with Ana since the age of two, since they lived together in an orphanage. At age 8 he went to the United States with his adoptive parents, which caused Andrés to lose all contact with his Spanish friends. He returns silently to Spain years later to recover what he lost when he was a child.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I wrote a web series! My name is Lily Bowen, and I am a thirteen year old actor. I have acted in a few films and many musical theatre productions. I audition regularly for film and TV projects, so I read a lot of scripts. I finally decided to write my own! In The Cooler Crew,  my character, Melanie is a middle school straight A student wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to long-term afterschool detention. Watch as she gets to know the other ""delinquents"" while attempting to clear her name and find out the real culprit. Episodes currently in pre-production! Subscribe to the YouTube channel for casting updates, behind the scenes footage, interviews, and of course, the episodes!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To produce this project, there are many costs involved: location rental, feeding the cast and crew on shoot days, props, equipment and if possible, paying our cast and crew for their work. The cast and crew will receive a credit, experience and footage for their demo reels, but ideally we would like to pay them too! <br/><br/>Any amount will help make this project a reality! A donation of $50 or more will grant you a Special Thanks by name in the credits of each episode. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lily continues to audition and work on other projects, but this is a great opportunity for her to gain exposure and experience. It will also provide the same for the rest of the cast and crew.</p>

<h3>About Black Girl in a Big Dress</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about this project!! We had an incredible first season and we really hope you'll be a part of this next chapter.</p>
<p>Like a lot of creators, I developed a show because I was longing for more content that I could relate to. It's been so exciting to watch Hollywood's interest for diverse content and diverse creators grow, and I was inspired to create something that continued to showcase the diversity within diversity. I knew that my friends and I loved bingewatching anything period (often in costume!), I knew that my friends and I had grand ideas about what romance should be like, and I knew that my friends and I happily embraced our geekdom, but I hadn't seen anyone quite like us on TV. So I decided to create something myself. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534278440/pg1g3izp5yg7nsr9k6y9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We released the first season last fall, and it's been a wonderful ride!! Black Girl in a Big Dress racked up more than 2 million views and was nominated for a Webby Award! But even more exciting than those things are the amazing conversations and camaraderie we've experienced connecting with people who like the show. It's been so wonderful to find so many people who are excited about this world and about sharing their passion with others. </p>

We're planning more episodes, longer episodes, higher production value, and the ability to reach even more new fans. Your donations will help ensure that people are fed, paid, and well taken care of while producing this project they are so passionate about.  <br/> </p>
<h3>Why We Need Indiegogo &amp; How You Can Help</h3>

But by popular demand from the community that has grown up around this show, we decided to make more episodes. The response has been amazingly, overwhelmingly excited and we can't wait to keep it going and you can help us reach that goal. </p>

<h3>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h3>
<p>The Gemini Show is currently in discussions with production companies. So depending on the result of meetings, pitches, etc, funds would either</p>
<p>A. Primarily go towards the quality of the pilot and the episodes made before joining said production company or...</p>
<p>B. Will be used for the whole length of the project</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Gemini Show is a web series created by 18 y/o Donovan Wade whose goal is to mix different medias from Music, Fashion, Acting, Art, Writing, etc from all types of people into a story that's interesting and relatable to young adults. We promote young adult's passions while exploring the challenges that many face in this transitional period in their lives. In this series, we see an anxious teenager named Gemini Daye stress over not knowing what he whats to do in the future, but after a psychedelic trip explores the world around him gaining knowledge and confidence while getting help from a mentor that only exists in his mind.  Here are some quotes from the people working on it and supporters who aren't.</p>
<p><strong>Grady McDonnell (19) </strong>""This show is the most unique project I have worked on, doing something that I haven't seen before.""</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Jacover (76)</strong> ""If you (Donovan Wade) actually do it, you'll be essentially creating a new genre.""</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funds will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renting sound equipment for shooting</li>
<li>Food for the crew after 7-12 hour workdays</li>
<li>Video Quality enhancement </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If done right The Gemini Show can be something that hasn't been done before. We have around 50 people from ages 17-25 working on this project from all over north Chicago. Our Production team is made up of college seniors and older whose profession is chromatography, sound, etc and have worked on TV shows as well. In these 8 episodes, we plan on having music videos, fashion shows, and other forms of Art embedded into our show. Many of the people working on this are a part of this because of these reasons...</p>
<ol>
<li>To have an extremely strong item to put on a creative resume</li>
<li>To promote their music, fashion, writing, brand, etc</li>
<li>To explore their creative side or to strengthen their skillset</li>
</ol>
<p>We have been planning this for months already in detail and truly believe that when enough support, funds, and marketing this could be something that can gain a large amount of traction in the media but also for individual's careers. Many of us are underclassmen in college trying to find our way, and this could help us big time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some risks are</p>
<ul><li>Production taking longer than expected because of the wide range of experience in the group and other responsibilities</li></ul>
<p>We try to avoid that by communicating within our group how to be the most efficient with time and money. Things and setbacks will always happen, but we try to plan in detail ahead of time so when they do we can adjust.</p>

The Gemini Show is currently in discussions with production companies. So depending on the result of meetings, pitches, etc, funds would either
A. Primarily go towards the quality of the pilot and the episodes made before joining said production company or...
B. Will be used for the whole length of the project
 
Short Summary
The Gemini Show is a web series created by 18 y/o Donovan Wade whose goal is to mix different medias from Music, Fashion, Acting, Art, Writing, etc from all types of people into a story that's interesting and relatable to young adults. We promote young adult's passions while exploring the challenges that many face in this transitional period in their lives. In this series, we see an anxious teenager named Gemini Daye stress over not knowing what he whats to do in the future, but after a psychedelic trip explores the world around him gaining knowledge and confidence while getting help from a mentor that only exists in his mind.  Here are some quotes from the people working on it and supporters who aren't.

<h3>So, What's This All About? </h3>
<p><i>Conscripted </i>follows the everyday lives of an ensemble of characters, all between the ages of 18 and 30, as their lives are turned upside down when a war breaks out on American soil, initiating the first draft since Vietnam.  Due to the ever growing New Realm Coalition, a domestic terrorist group whose tactics are technologically advanced and unpredictable, the country slowly becomes divided, until states and certain cities (Los Angeles being one) become sanctioned and the country is divided by East and West.  Our story follows four main characters: Sabina, John, Lyla, and Piper.  As we start out following them individually, their paths become intertwined as the story goes on. </p>
<p><i>Conscripted </i>is being shot in conjunction with Loyola Marymount University and Film Independent's Incubator Lab. Sara has spent the past year in the lab working with industry professionals to further hone the script to it's fullest potential for production. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why This Story? Why Now?</h3>
<p>It's no secret that our country is more politically divided now than it ever has been. We're quick to point fingers and blame fault elsewhere instead of taking responsibility for the society we've become.  In recent years, Sara has gravitated toward writing about what scares her; exploring what she doesn't understand:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""War has always been an enigma to me. I’ve never understood how someone could support violence. The more I’ve explored writing and rewriting this piece over the past couple of years, the more I’ve understood another perspective; one of protection, pride, and promise. Only now do I understand that the word “freedom” has multiple meanings to different people. Though my stance on war has remained the same, I find myself understanding another’s stance. That said, my main outcome for this story is to help others (and myself) explore the possibility that a country (and world) divided is not the right answer, and will never lead to freedom, regardless of one’s definition of it.""</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Damage? About That...</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise a minimum of $7,500 to get us through production and post production. $7,500 is a lot of money! Who knew! (Kidding). However, if you'd like to help us raise more than that, we won't object! Take some time to browse the perks we've listed (there are a lot and they're all super cool, we promise!)</p>
<p>Should we not raise the total $7,500, we will still trudge on with production, though in a bit more debt than when we started. We're aiming to make this the best it can possibly be, and every dollar helps us get there! We're determined to see this project through the finish line.</p>

<h3>Ever wonder what the life of a blue collared citizen of the Imperium 40,000 years in the future was like?</h3>
<p>Hey everybody, Matthew here from <a href=""https://www.miniwargaming.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MiniWarGaming.com</a>.  </p>
<p>For the past ten years we have been making videos about miniature wargaming.  One of our favourite games, Warhammer 40k, has brought us countless hours of enjoyment (and frustration...).  Warhammer 40k has rich lore, awesome miniatures, and a fun miniature wargame.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDaqW9sdc1Q?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(Above is an example of our battle reports)</i></p>

</div></div>","Ever wonder what the life of a blue collared citizen of the Imperium 40,000 years in the future was like?
Hey everybody, Matthew here from MiniWarGaming.com.  
For the past ten years we have been making videos about miniature wargaming.  One of our favourite games, Warhammer 40k, has brought us countless hours of enjoyment (and frustration...).  Warhammer 40k has rich lore, awesome miniatures, and a fun miniature wargame.

(Above is an example of our battle reports)
However, the one thing we haven't really gotten into is making a roleplaying show.
This isn't due to lack of passion.  Dave (the other founder of MiniWarGaming) and I have played RPGs together since we were kids, from Mechwarrior to Fighting Fantasy, to Dungeons and Dragons to even home-brewed systems.  And most of the rest of our staff have either played RPGs, or are big into them right now.
This brings us to our idea to run an RPG show, the first one using the Dark Heresy 2nd Edition rules, but instead of focusing on acolytes working for an Inquisitor (that sounds WAY too important), we will be telling the story of regular blue collar workers caught in the midst of a chaos uprising. 

These poor saps (along with Dave and Josh) probably won't last more than a game or two, but we'll just keep making more!
You'll get to laugh (and maybe cry) as the MiniWarGaming crew try to get along long enough to actually work together to stay alive and deal with the everyday horrible life that is the Warhammer 40k universe.
This is a big step for MiniWarGaming, as RPG shows cost a lot more to produce, given the time and resources it takes to make them.  Compare the following requirements:

Battle Reports are most often filmed between an unpaid volunteer and a paid staff member, take roughly 3-5 hours to film, and an hour to edit

One episode of an RPG show would be filmed between five to seven paid staff members, plus a support staff member managing all of the cameras, plus a LOT more post production editing.

Not only that, but instead of filming with one camera (which we do with our battle reports), we will be filming with three or four cameras.
We'll also need to spend money on:

An expensive computer that has all of the requirements to directly record from multiple cameras simultaneously

New audio equipment to allow five to seven people to be properly recorded

New lighting equipment to properly light the scene

Now, thanks to our wonderful Vault members, we could definitely afford to do some of those things, which is why what we're trying to raise won't even cover all of our costs, and our stretch goals will help us to do even more with the show.
But if we really want to see this come to fruition, we need to know that this is something you want, and some funds to help us get it started.
Having said that, if we don't reach our goal, we've still set it to flexible funding as that will allow us to collect whatever is contributed and use it to make the RPG show anyways, but we'll just be limited in what we can do, and how free the show is.
In other words, we want to make this show free (with maybe some paid extras, which you can get as a Vault member or as a contributor to this campaign), but can only do so if we raise enough funds.
What You'll Get
While we want this show to be free (which it will be if we reach our goal), we really want to ""entice"" you to contribute to this campaign.
This is why we are focusing on perks that allow you to contribute and participate in the show.
For example, for just $20 you'll gain access to the episodes as we make them (rather than months afterwards), so that you can leave comments and suggestions on what you want to see in the next episodes.
In my past narrative campaigns I have often taken ideas from comments and incorporated them into the show.

<p>You've never seen a dramatic live-action Batman show.  Nor have you seen a prequel to <i>Batman Beyond.  </i>Now, here is your chance to not only witness a landmark in Batman history, but to also be a part of it!  Inspired by <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>, <i>Batman: Master of Fear </i>is a web series that gives you--the fans--everything you have ever wanted from a live-action take on the character: a Batman who displays his detective and martial arts skills against a Gothic Horror backdrop.  And, we even introduce a brand new villain: Nightmare. </p>
<p>With the first episode already released, we now need the funds to make episode 2.  Our plan to is to make three episodes to pitch to Warner Brothers as a TV show.  (We even have the first four seasons outlined).  <i>Batman: Master of Fear<i> </i></i>is the future of live-action Batman, and, once again, this is your opportunity to help make it happen!</p>
<h2>Premise</h2>
<p>Batman's time has come, and he knows it.  <i>Batman: Master of Fear</i> is the tale of Batman's final mission to protect Gotham from his deadliest enemy yet--Nightmare, who will usher in a new era of criminals.  *For more info, scroll to the bottom.</p>

<p>Founded in 2015, Red Fist creates action-packed stories that heavily involve martial arts.  We have been relentlessly pursuing our goal to create products that balance story and action.  In the age of a saturated YouTube market, and rampant fan films, we know that a Batman web series is the perfect way for us to follow the trends in our own way.</p>
<h2>Why it's Important to Us</h2>
<p>We're huge fans of <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>, and we wanted to do our own live-action take on the character.  We are excited to reinvent Batman (in look, fighting style, and overall characterization) and his universe (into more of a Gothic Horror feel).  On top of that, we wanted to create an original story that is not based on any previous Batman work.  That's why we also wanted to introduce a new villain to the fans.  We've been working on this show 100% for over two years because we know that it will be something the fans will love.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The two characters that we created for this show--Nightmare and Raven--have the potential to officially become DC characters.  Their personalities, skills, and motivations fit right into the Batman universe. And, the portrayals by established actors add to their legitimacy.  Nightmare even has a Lego made of him already.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why Batman?  </h3>
<p>Ever since we saw<i> Batman: The Animated Series</i> as kids, we have been captivated by the Caped Crusader.  Now that we’re adults, we want to contribute our version to the ever-growing Batman mythos.  Batman is considered one of the greatest martial artists in the world, but we have not yet seen that in live-action form.  Since we’re also fans of Martial Arts films, we have been waiting to see Batman truly kick ass for a very long time.  And now, we are excited to bring you a Batman that you’ve never seen before!</p>
<h3>How were you able to make the last episode?</h3>
<p>We crowdfunded right here on Indiegogo, in 2016.  Combined with our intake of about $3,000 and our own funds, we made the episode for just $4,000.  And those expenses were similar to those for Episode 2.  The difference is that, because there are more actors and crewmembers this time, we have to ration out our budget to fly, lodge, and feed everybody, pay certain crewmembers for their services (in addition to securing locations and marketing).</p>
<h3>Isn’t this illegal?</h3>
<p>Yes, next question.  No, it’s not illegal because the Fair Use clause of copyright law (specifically, the Transformative doctrine) states that any original interpretation of intellectual property is legal.  In other words, since we came up with an original story and some original characters that are set in a ""copyrighted"" universe, we're okay.</p>

</ul>
<p>Whether we reach 100% of our goal or fall a bit short, we will push production as far as possible! We are very passionate about this story and will take any steps necessary to achieve our goal!</p>
<p>Please note: this series is a pilot for a well-known company. Therefore, we are unable to give away any copywritten materials such as scripts, footage, or digital copies of the work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You are Supporting</h3>
<p>Belladonna seeks to bring a new concept in entertainment to the household viewer. We will leave the audience wanting more though the creation of engaging, relatable, and enamoring storylines. In addition, we will shed light on Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy by telling the story of Dr. Annabelle Ricci and the effect she has on her patients. This series will convey the dangers of Munchausen when left untreated. In addition, the arc of her patients directly correlates with the ""treatment"" they are receiving. </p>
<p>This story is the second project of Writer / Director Rupanshi Didwania. She has a proven track record in bringing stories to life, and conveying them to the masses. Rupanshi's most recent feature-length film will be distributed to audiences worldwide in July. Alongside Rupanshi, the team behind Belladonna have the experience it takes to bring a concept to fruition and secure the necessary distribution to maximize viewership.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is securing 3-5 additional crew members that we feel are qualified to help Belladonna achieve the highest production value possible. We will be incredibly selective with this process, and will likely appoint filmmakers with extensive experience. This is the main reason we are seeking a larger budget so we can reward our crew for the talent they bring to the production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that some do not have the financial capacity to support us in our endeavors. The team would like you to know that it is equally important for those who believe in our project to spread the word as far as possible! Your support and excitement are priceless so tell all your friends, family, coworkers, and maybe even enemies about Belladonna!</p>

<p><strong>Swords...</strong> They are everywhere in our culture, our history, and movies. From Science Fiction to medieval history, the Ultimate symbol of the warrior is the sword. The ultimate survival tool, a Blade.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525923071/jcfr5q3evri82kd88msg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Above: A collaboration Piece by the cast. </i></p>
<p><strong>The Forge</strong> is an original reality series about a collaborative modern day blade smiting shop, near Austin, The Live Music Capital of the World, featuring world-class blade smiths and artists working together to create iconic weapons for movies, martial artist , hunters, survivalists and collectors. Each episode, 4 of the nation’s best bladesmiths come together to put their skill and reputations to the test. They put their heart and soul into making the finest blades in the country using everything from traditional historical methods to cutting edge innovations in metallurgy and science.</p>
<p>Several of the main cast of <strong>The Forge</strong> happen to be champions from the hit TV series Forged in Fire: Guy Harris, James Huse and Chris Farrell as well as  fellow blade smith and contestant Larry Clements, a combative expert and  and Guinness World Record Cutter ,Brandt Noel.</p>
<p>These smiths have already agreed to be a part of this project  once we are set up to shoot later this year. Several known smiths in the area (and TV) are planning to drop in for  guest appearances, cameos and possibly to lend a hand. I think they just want to use our tools... we’re okay with that.  Several non forging celebrities have expressed interest to come on the show to create a blade as well. </p>
<p>Each episode will follow the cast and crew as they work together create a one of a kind functional blade or weapon and, of course, these weapons will be tested.  The series will cover interesting facts on the techniques and methods the smiths use to create the blade, how the smiths do it and how these blades are intended to be used.</p>
<p>We also have our fingers in the pot for several block buster films projects designing and creating the swords and knives for those.</p>
<p>We make blades  for some serious and sometimes famous Martial Artist as well as  celebrities. Some of the high-end blades we make for collectors can go as high as $15,000.  We dont stop there though, all of the smiths have been doing commissions for customers for years. Every able bodies person can use a good blade. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526685294/fgtk32voehx9tftuyz5t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Of course the drive of the series is watching these “artists” try and work together. Each one can make a blade start to finish and each on has their own way of doing things. Each has their strengths and weaknesses. This show, filled with big personalities (and sometimes bigger tempers) along with very sharp steel has everything a great reality show needs.</p>
<p>In the genre of Swamp Loggers, American Chopper and Ice Road Truckers any wrong move can put you in the hospital or kill you. Even if it’s a sharp tongue.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525923248/hpfadgszcborgrlhdkev.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Series projects won’t be limited to just the weapon of the episode but also whatever else the cast may be working on or get involved in. You would probably be really surprised what the cast get involved with... from Battle Bots to trebuchets, Movies to Rock’n’Roll, Cub Scouts to Special Forces, Photoshoots to Video Games and the list goes on... and on.</p>
<p>Swords aren’t just part of history, they defined much of history, and we will cover some of that too.</p>
<p>Of course there are always exciting adventure and travel opportunities to take the cast on the road every once and a while when something relevant to the show comes along: from visiting local music venues, Martial art schools, competitions, Hammer-ins, hanging out with the people who love our blades, Anything relevant to Modern Combat or Survival, MMA, even culinary opportunities can arise. (We have a full blown Cajun in the cast and a baker.) </p>
<p>These smiths make everything from Swords to Chef Knives and they know how to use them too.</p>

<p>Several big networks and sponsors want to see a full pilot. A streaming channel already wants it.  All we have to do is get it shot... and edited...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we need to make this happen:</strong></p>
<p>First, we need a <strong>location</strong> to shoot.  Funds raised in this crowdfunder will be used to secure a location for a working set to film the show. The set needs to combine portions of each smith’s tools and for a camera crew to shoot.</p>
<p>We estimate a necessary 6 month lease to get everything setup and shoot a full episode pilot. We would prefer to secure a 12 month lease.  [These tools are HEAVY]</p>
<p>Everything else will be production budget to shoot and produce the pilot. If enough funds are raised we will shoot a short season to show the networks the breadth of the show... Seriously we have 52 possible episodes penciled out. We already have enough material ideas for more than 4 seasons...  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525922134/n4j3vzsltvjqeazdyduj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“Give me a blade and fire and I can make anything.”</i> Guy Harris</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong></p>
<p><u>Finding a location</u>. Not really a big risk in the eyes of some if we met our funding goal but the location is a key element.  The location needs to be secure and more important we need it for a set period of time. This workshop / set location won’t be easy to just up and move. None of the main cast have a shop or forge large enough to work out of... believe me, we have tried.</p>
<p>All of the test footage and trailer footage was shot at different times at each smiths shop. </p>
<p><u>Shooting the pilot.</u> The series will be shot near Austin, Texas where a strong film industry and support system already exists of talent for all stages of production.</p>
<p>Lots of movies and TV has been shot here in Austin and it has a known and growing film industry.</p>
<p>The only risk with shooting the pilot would be raising enough funds to cover the location AND the Production Budget. </p>
<p>The resources are here. Again funding is key but we have already begun reaching out to several local production companies and Professionals in the area.</p>
<p>Several have actually already reached out to us.</p>
<p>Shooting a short series (3) or half series (6) and yes potentially a full 13 episode series.</p>
<p>If funding goes extremely well ... extra tools to do bigger projects...</p>
<p>In the event the big networks  do not  choose to pick up the series to air on cable or broadcast service, we are already talking with a company that specializes in streaming services. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Funding goals</strong>:</p>
<p>We have set our goal based on a $30k for lease. $2500/month for lease and utilities, for 12 months. $75,000 is a high goal but it will cover the lease and cost of the perks. </p>
<p>Additional Funds will be used for shooting the series. We are planning to have [minimum] 3 cameras during filming and estimating each episode will take 2 weeks. Additionally an Editor will be on hand to coordinate the video  and edit it into episodes</p>
<p>Lighting will be built into the set location.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Surpassing our funding goals:</strong></p>
<p>Having funds on hand for additional materials would be handy: Extra steels, handle materials, leather, polishing and grinding belts. Possibly extra equipment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Operational costs… supplies, belts!!!!, fuel for the forges, lubricant, steel… etc… lights electricity..</p>

Of course the drive of the series is watching these “artists” try and work together. Each one can make a blade start to finish and each on has their own way of doing things. Each has their strengths and weaknesses. This show, filled with big personalities (and sometimes bigger tempers) along with very sharp steel has everything a great reality show needs.
In the genre of Swamp Loggers, American Chopper and Ice Road Truckers any wrong move can put you in the hospital or kill you. Even if it’s a sharp tongue.

Series projects won’t be limited to just the weapon of the episode but also whatever else the cast may be working on or get involved in. You would probably be really surprised what the cast get involved with... from Battle Bots to trebuchets, Movies to Rock’n’Roll, Cub Scouts to Special Forces, Photoshoots to Video Games and the list goes on... and on.
Swords aren’t just part of history, they defined much of history, and we will cover some of that too.
Of course there are always exciting adventure and travel opportunities to take the cast on the road every once and a while when something relevant to the show comes along: from visiting local music venues, Martial art schools, competitions, Hammer-ins, hanging out with the people who love our blades, Anything relevant to Modern Combat or Survival, MMA, even culinary opportunities can arise. (We have a full blown Cajun in the cast and a baker.) 
These smiths make everything from Swords to Chef Knives and they know how to use them too.

Several big networks and sponsors want to see a full pilot. A streaming channel already wants it.  All we have to do is get it shot... and edited...
 
What we need to make this happen:
First, we need a location to shoot.  Funds raised in this crowdfunder will be used to secure a location for a working set to film the show. The set needs to combine portions of each smith’s tools and for a camera crew to shoot.
We estimate a necessary 6 month lease to get everything setup and shoot a full episode pilot. We would prefer to secure a 12 month lease.  [These tools are HEAVY]
Everything else will be production budget to shoot and produce the pilot. If enough funds are raised we will shoot a short season to show the networks the breadth of the show... Seriously we have 52 possible episodes penciled out. We already have enough material ideas for more than 4 seasons...  
 

“Give me a blade and fire and I can make anything.” Guy Harris
 
 
Risks:
Finding a location. Not really a big risk in the eyes of some if we met our funding goal but the location is a key element.  The location needs to be secure and more important we need it for a set period of time. This workshop / set location won’t be easy to just up and move. None of the main cast have a shop or forge large enough to work out of... believe me, we have tried.
All of the test footage and trailer footage was shot at different times at each smiths shop. 
Shooting the pilot. The series will be shot near Austin, Texas where a strong film industry and support system already exists of talent for all stages of production.
Lots of movies and TV has been shot here in Austin and it has a known and growing film industry.
The only risk with shooting the pilot would be raising enough funds to cover the location AND the Production Budget. 
The resources are here. Again funding is key but we have already begun reaching out to several local production companies and Professionals in the area.
Several have actually already reached out to us.
Shooting a short series (3) or half series (6) and yes potentially a full 13 episode series.
If funding goes extremely well ... extra tools to do bigger projects...
In the event the big networks  do not  choose to pick up the series to air on cable or broadcast service, we are already talking with a company that specializes in streaming services.

Of course everyone who donates will receive our newsletter with updates on the progress of the show. 

 
Funding goals:
We have set our goal based on a $30k for lease. $2500/month for lease and utilities, for 12 months. $75,000 is a high goal but it will cover the lease and cost of the perks. 
Additional Funds will be used for shooting the series. We are planning to have [minimum] 3 cameras during filming and estimating each episode will take 2 weeks. Additionally an Editor will be on hand to coordinate the video  and edit it into episodes
Lighting will be built into the set location.
 
Surpassing our funding goals:
Having funds on hand for additional materials would be handy: Extra steels, handle materials, leather, polishing and grinding belts. Possibly extra equipment. 
 
Operational costs… supplies, belts!!!!, fuel for the forges, lubricant, steel… etc… lights electricity..",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Accents</i> is a sitcom about six immigrant friends. Each character is from a different part of the world, but life has brought all of them together in none other than present-day America. These six friends must stick together as they deal with work, love, hate, and each other.</p>
<p>My name is Ignacio Arreola-Vidal, and I am the creator of <i>Accents</i>, the biggest project of Atlanta Cinemaniacs so far.</p>
<p>Atlanta Cinemaniacs is a group of passionate and creative people, dedicated to performing every step of the filmmaking process. We're throwing all of our effort and resources into <i>Accents</i>, and we have contacts with multiple filming services, from makeup artists to studios. But the next step is funding, and we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of the funds we receive will be invested in producing and filming our first episode, the pilot. We've calculated that $25,000 is needed to create the respectable, good-quality pilot we need to pitch and sell our show to a promising cable or streaming network. Our campaign goal is a nickel compared to what is commonly spent per television episode in this day and age.</p>
<p>The following is a list of what the money will be spent on. Of course, if the goal is not met, we will be forced to prioritize the production's needs.</p>
<p>If goal is met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cast</li>
<li>Crew</li>
<li>Studio</li>
<li>Camera equipment</li>
<li>Sound equipment</li>
<li>Lighting equipment</li>
<li>Art department (Set/Props)</li>
<li>Wardrobe</li>
<li>Makeup/Hair</li>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Color correction</li>
<li>Sound editing/mixing</li>
<li>Music rights</li>

<p>Every dollar counts! We appreciate any help you can give and want to make sure you get something amazing in return. Check out all of our perks!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Accents</i> isn't just a random title. It pertains to something that is a <i>part</i> of your identity, rather than the <i>definition</i> of it. This television series is about people, people that have all kinds of hardships to deal with, and being an immigrant is one of them.</p>
<p>Representation is a big hook in film right now, and that's not lost on us. We're grateful that we've found a group of hilarious, diverse people that loves to tell stories about hilarious, diverse characters.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Building a tv show from the ground up does not come without its challenges. There is always a possibility that the actors or crew or other members of the production we work with will experience creative differences, but we will make sure that everyone is on the same page. Everyone we work with is vetted to make sure they carry with them the same passion and initiative we do.</p>
<p>There is another possibility that our pilot may not get picked up by a network right away. We have prepared ourselves to hear ""No"" every step of the way, but because we wholeheartedly believe in this project, we will not stop until we are on the air.</p>

Right now, we’re focusing on making the first four episodes - and we need your help.By contributing, you’re helping us get women of different colors, sizes, shapes and persuasions on people’s screens. Plus, we’re not just putting more realistic women ON camera - we’re putting ladies to work BEHIND the camera, too!When you contribute, you’ll be part of the change we need to see in entertainment. (Oprah will be SO proud of you.)Making a film, even a short one, is expensive. For these four episodes we need funding for
Equipment
Insurance
Feeding and paying to our cast and crew
We believe in paying young artists for their work -- that is extremely important to us, because we are part of a generation that is frequently asked/required to work for free.We want to make sure LABELS is easily accessible and shareable content. We can’t do it without you, so consider making a contribution big or small! We have some dope custom-designed, limited-edition bags you can snag for only $25. Seriously. Wanna Know More About Each Episode?You’re super nosey and we love it. Check out the breakdowns below:EPISODE 1: OPENAudra and Bryony don’t want to ruin their burgeoning romance with antiquated ideas like labels and commitment. OPEN  is about young women of color struggling with love, commitment, and the meaning of a 21st century queer relationship.And we promise that Audra or Bryony will not end up dead at the end. Because we know that it is possible to tell an interesting, realistic queer romance story without killing anyone off!Think we’re being dramatic?  It’s a well-documented fiction trope called “Bury Your Gays” in which gay and lesbian characters are denied a happy ending (also re-appropriated as the “Too Good for This Sinful Earth” trope.)We look forward to working against those tropes & keeping lesbians and women of color ALIVE on your screens!EPISODE 2: GAMEPLAYScrabble and sangria-addicted roommates Charlie and Florence are very different kinds of young women, but they’ve both slept with their friend Louis. GAMEPLAY  is about knowing every nook & cranny of your roomie’s love life, and the insane rules of ‘textual’/app-based communication.Catch feelings? You lose the game!EPISODE 3: UNOWilla never stops working. But, with her boss on vacation, she finally has an entire weekend to herself. UNO  is about learning how to hang out with yourself, recover from Tinder binges and how strange and wonderful alone-time in New York City can feel.Maybe the happiest ending is when the girl doesn’t get the egotistical-but-has-great-hair guy? Yeah? Yeah.EPISODE 4: WHITE RABBITAlice returns to her hometown after a devastating career setback. She starts hooking up with her high school old flame. When that becomes sorta serious, she decides to move back to her hometown. WHITE RABBIT  is about realizing that easy isn’t the same as happy. Manic pixie hometown hookups are never 4ever. Have a gr8 summer! Wanna Give Us Million Dollars, but You’re Not a Millionaire?That’s okay! This is a series of the people! Every little bit counts, even if it’s only a few bucks - give what you can.Definitely like us on Facebook, share this on your social media, and send this campaign to your family, friends, acquaintances, and mortal enemies (we need all the help we can get!)Don’t Have Any Mortal Enemies?Congratulations. Wanna Know What Else You Can Do?You can make your voice heard!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m Julie-Anne Liechty, creator of AESOP, a new post-apocalyptic medieval series. Of course, I didn’t do this alone. The quick story is – I was inspired to write a little short film about a warrior and a boy-seer who was “touched”.</p>
<p>I showed the script to a couple of friends and they said, “Hey, I think there’s a bigger story in here. What if we tried to make a pilot? And then do a series?”</p>
<p>Pretty soon, we had a whole crew of people who caught the excitement about AESOP and the project grew and grew. Then we needed some funding . . .</p>
<p>Which is why we’re here.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504551556/wfgvl20qc0le7w80op1w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Kylee Ferguson (Aesop's Body Double), Julie-Anne Liechty (Director/Writer), and Shane Moore (Sound) on the set of AESOP</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reason this project is so important to me, is not just because I like a good story, but my main hope is to create work for fellow actors, film crew and technicians. If we had a successful series filmed right here in our own back yard it would benefit all of us financially and create more industry for our community. Nothing would make me happier.</p>
<p>Getting a series off the ground is an ambitious endeavor. Without your help, we just won’t be able to do it. Our hope is once we have the pilot shot the quality of the story and our production of it will attract interest from industry professionals and angel investors who want to see the project reach its fullest potential.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Filming is expensive. I wish it wasn’t, but do you ever sit at the end of a movie and watch the credits? They seem to go on forever, right? That’s because it takes SO MANY people to make a movie or TV series. Yes, they make it look easy, but in fact it takes arduous hours, days, even months of work.</p>
<p>We’re really good at stretching the budget. Heck, I made the teaser for AESOP for basically nothing – most of the $ went to the Friesian horses – they eat a lot . . . ;)</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Annette Coester and her Friesian Stallion Jesse 435 Sport </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To shoot the pilot we’re asking for $12,000.00 to start off with. That’s to get about half of it done. You see, we’ve got four major scenes to shoot by September 11th, so we thought we’d do two separate fundraisers, so we could have access to the funds by the 9th to rent the equipment, etc. Who knows, maybe we’ll get more than $12k this time around. Wouldn’t that be nice? Then we won’t have to bug anyone again anytime soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here’s our approximate budget for four days of shooting:</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The comedy shorts COCK N' BULL and COCK N' BULL 2 played film festivals around the world and received distribution from multiple streaming platforms. Throughout its release, one character, played by Pete Zias, was clearly a fan favorite. We knew we had to explore these three characters more through their bizarre throuple movie nights.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The original COCK N' BULL shorts</h3>
<p>Completely improvised, COCK N' BULL and COCK N' BULL 2 had long film festival runs, including Outfest Los Angeles, Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival/SHOUT!, Reeling Chicago International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, Pride of the Ocean Film Festival and the Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. Both shorts received worldwide distribution from Seed &amp; Spark, Dekkoo and Revry.</p>
<p>Shorts, independent films and web series such as ours typically do not see a financial return, which is why this campaign is so important to produce it. We do it because we love it and want to continue making audiences laugh around the world!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p><strong>Nathan Adloff </strong>(Director/Writer/Producer/Actor - ""Chris"")</p>
<p>Nathan made his feature film debut with NATE &amp; MARGARET (Co-Wrote/Produced/Directed). It sold for worldwide distribution prior to completion. It also received a commendatory review from Roger Ebert.<br/><br/>Nathan acted in Joe Swanberg's early films and IFC series, YOUNG AMERICAN BODIES in addition to directing a handful of award-winning short films. He also co-created and directed a TV pilot, BAD SIDES, which was a finalist in the Chicago Comedy TV Pilot Competition. His first leading role in the film, BLACKMAIL BOYS, won various film festival awards and sold for worldwide distribution. His short film COCK N' BULL was selected to screen in the 2013 Outfest Los Angeles LGBT Film Festival, which he also acted in. In 2014, his short GROWN THIS WAY won a best film award in Outfest's Fusion Lab.<br/><br/>In 2016, Nathan sold his second feature film, ""Miles"". The story centers around a high school senior who joins the girls volleyball team in hopes of winning a college scholarship after his father's untimely death. It stars Molly Shannon, Paul Reiser, Missi Pyle, Tim Boardman, Annie Golden, Yeardley Smith and Stephen Root.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Danny Rhodes</strong> (Writer/Producer/Actor - ""Wes"")</p>
<p>Danny is a Chicago based actor, writer, and producer. Rhodes began his acting career in the theater while earning his Bachelor's Degree in Acting  from Columbia College Chicago. After graduation Rhodes made his feature film debut with a small role in STRANGER THAN FICTION and has since landed roles in several independent films including HOHOKAM, AUDREY THE TRAINWRECK, NATE &amp; MARGARET, ONE SMALL HITCH, BAD JOHNSON, HOUSE OF PURGATORY and WHO GETS THE DOG?.</p>
<p>He made his writing and producing debut with the TV series BAD SIDES, in which Rhodes also starred in the hilarious role of Marcuss, a spoiled, trust-fund baby with aspirations of being a filmmaker who makes ridiculous demands on his staff and the actors who audition for him. His other television work includes roles on the TV series DETROIT 1-8-7,  CHICAGO FIRE, and CHICAGO P.D.</p>
<p>Rhodes recently formed his own production company, the Chicago based Rhodesclosed Productions, with his producing partners Teresa Schaeffer and Lisa Cisneros. Rhodesclosed Productions has two films on their slate for the upcoming year... ONE NOT TAKEN, a psychological horror feature to be directed by Huck Botko and INHERITED, a horror comedy loosely based on actual events.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Brian Levin</strong> (Cinematographer/Editor)</p>
<p>""Ever since I was young, seeing movies and listening to stories was my greatest passion. The mechanics of how a story is told, how an audience will perceive a story, and how the teller delivers that story are constantly on my mind.</p>
<p>I am always working towards the goal of providing a creative environment to effectively deliver an exciting story to the screen. I love talking about the creation of a film project, and sharing my knowledge and philosophies with others.</p>
<p>I approach filmmaking with a keen sense of understanding from the smallest technical detail to the overall big picture. I enjoy understanding the minutiae of making a film as much as I enjoy overseeing the formation of the story as a whole.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>""Why IndieGoGo if you made the first films for basically nothing??""</h3>
<p>Good question! We upped our production value greatly on COCK N' BULL 2 and want to keep that momentum going. We are also producing six episodes, which are ultimately six short films! Here is what your contribution will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food for actors and crew.</li>
<li>Renting cameras, lights and other necessary equipment.</li>
<li>Set design and props.</li>
<li>Film Festival submission fees.</li>
<li>Much, much more!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Story</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The comedy shorts COCK N' BULL and COCK N' BULL 2 played film festivals around the world and received distribution from multiple streaming platforms. Throughout its release, one character, played by Pete Zias, was clearly a fan favorite. We knew we had to explore these three characters more through their bizarre throuple movie nights. 

The original COCK N' BULL shorts
Completely improvised, COCK N' BULL and COCK N' BULL 2 had long film festival runs, including Outfest Los Angeles, Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival/SHOUT!, Reeling Chicago International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, Pride of the Ocean Film Festival and the Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. Both shorts received worldwide distribution from Seed & Spark, Dekkoo and Revry.
Shorts, independent films and web series such as ours typically do not see a financial return, which is why this campaign is so important to produce it. We do it because we love it and want to continue making audiences laugh around the world!
 
Who are we?
Nathan Adloff (Director/Writer/Producer/Actor - ""Chris"")
Nathan made his feature film debut with NATE & MARGARET (Co-Wrote/Produced/Directed). It sold for worldwide distribution prior to completion. It also received a commendatory review from Roger Ebert.Nathan acted in Joe Swanberg's early films and IFC series, YOUNG AMERICAN BODIES in addition to directing a handful of award-winning short films. He also co-created and directed a TV pilot, BAD SIDES, which was a finalist in the Chicago Comedy TV Pilot Competition. His first leading role in the film, BLACKMAIL BOYS, won various film festival awards and sold for worldwide distribution. His short film COCK N' BULL was selected to screen in the 2013 Outfest Los Angeles LGBT Film Festival, which he also acted in. In 2014, his short GROWN THIS WAY won a best film award in Outfest's Fusion Lab.In 2016, Nathan sold his second feature film, ""Miles"". The story centers around a high school senior who joins the girls volleyball team in hopes of winning a college scholarship after his father's untimely death. It stars Molly Shannon, Paul Reiser, Missi Pyle, Tim Boardman, Annie Golden, Yeardley Smith and Stephen Root.
 
Danny Rhodes (Writer/Producer/Actor - ""Wes"")
Danny is a Chicago based actor, writer, and producer. Rhodes began his acting career in the theater while earning his Bachelor's Degree in Acting  from Columbia College Chicago. After graduation Rhodes made his feature film debut with a small role in STRANGER THAN FICTION and has since landed roles in several independent films including HOHOKAM, AUDREY THE TRAINWRECK, NATE & MARGARET, ONE SMALL HITCH, BAD JOHNSON, HOUSE OF PURGATORY and WHO GETS THE DOG?.
He made his writing and producing debut with the TV series BAD SIDES, in which Rhodes also starred in the hilarious role of Marcuss, a spoiled, trust-fund baby with aspirations of being a filmmaker who makes ridiculous demands on his staff and the actors who audition for him. His other television work includes roles on the TV series DETROIT 1-8-7,  CHICAGO FIRE, and CHICAGO P.D.
Rhodes recently formed his own production company, the Chicago based Rhodesclosed Productions, with his producing partners Teresa Schaeffer and Lisa Cisneros. Rhodesclosed Productions has two films on their slate for the upcoming year... ONE NOT TAKEN, a psychological horror feature to be directed by Huck Botko and INHERITED, a horror comedy loosely based on actual events.
 
Brian Levin (Cinematographer/Editor)
""Ever since I was young, seeing movies and listening to stories was my greatest passion. The mechanics of how a story is told, how an audience will perceive a story, and how the teller delivers that story are constantly on my mind.
I am always working towards the goal of providing a creative environment to effectively deliver an exciting story to the screen. I love talking about the creation of a film project, and sharing my knowledge and philosophies with others.
I approach filmmaking with a keen sense of understanding from the smallest technical detail to the overall big picture. I enjoy understanding the minutiae of making a film as much as I enjoy overseeing the formation of the story as a whole.""
 
""Why IndieGoGo if you made the first films for basically nothing??""
Good question! We upped our production value greatly on COCK N' BULL 2 and want to keep that momentum going. We are also producing six episodes, which are ultimately six short films! Here is what your contribution will go toward:

Food for actors and crew.
Renting cameras, lights and other necessary equipment.
Set design and props.
Film Festival submission fees.
Much, much more!

 
The Story
The first short focused on prank calls gone wrong. The second focused on the risks of awkward online hookups.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m ready to tell you a story that you never knew you needed to hear. </p>
<p>My name is Bobby Ulrich and I’m a stand-up comedian, social media content creator, and aspiring television writer/creator based in Los Angeles, California. I have been given a dream opportunity to shoot a pilot episode for a television show that I wrote while living in an influncer house with no money and no professional connections whatsoever. </p>
<p>Some of you may know me from being involved with some of the biggest internet entertainment channels such as, the “Funk Bros”, “The Mob”, or the newly created “Parea” influencer house, in which I live amongst some of the internet’s most popular and talented social media influencers in the entire world. My experience living with such fun and interesting people has given me the inspiration to tell an incredibly hilarious story that comes from a unique and truly one of a kind perspective. </p>
<p>With your generous support, we will be able to accomplish the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a professional high quality television episode with the hopes of getting picked up by a large streaming network (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc.)</li>
<li>Pay our actors and production crew! (and feed them.)</li>

<p>Our goal for this project is to raise at least $20,000, in order to make an enormous difference in the quality and resources available to create the most professional looking pilot possible, in order to have the best chance of getting this show picked up by a large television or streaming network. </p>
<p>Although we have some good traction, television production is an expensive business, especially if you want to do it right by following union rules, paying your actors, incorporating high-quality sound design, editing, software for pre and post production and of course properly compensating all who are involved.

<h3>The Crew</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Daisy Morecroft- <strong>Producer</strong></p>
<p>Hey all, I'm Daisy and I will be Producing <i>The Ambrosia Effect. </i>When I first read the script, I knew it was the project I wanted to sink my teeth into and end my degree with a bang! As an aspiring Producer, I hope this project will allow my skills to flourish and showcase the talent of our wonderful cast and crew. </p>
<p>Rebecca White- <strong>Director</strong></p>
<p>Hi! I’m Rebecca and I’m the Writer and Director of<i> The Ambrosia Effect. </i>I’ve always been a huge fan of the science fiction drama and after watching <i>Black Mirror </i>and <i>Channel 4s Humans</i>. I knew I wanted to create such a drama with similar moralistic and thought provoking narrative with a dynamic and talented cast. With the script written, actors lined up and a fantastic crew put together, we have the making of a great short film that we want to share with you.

<p>As DOP, I am really excited to be involved in this production and with this talented crew.

Daisy Morecroft- Producer
Hey all, I'm Daisy and I will be Producing The Ambrosia Effect. When I first read the script, I knew it was the project I wanted to sink my teeth into and end my degree with a bang! As an aspiring Producer, I hope this project will allow my skills to flourish and showcase the talent of our wonderful cast and crew. 
Rebecca White- Director
Hi! I’m Rebecca and I’m the Writer and Director of The Ambrosia Effect. I’ve always been a huge fan of the science fiction drama and after watching Black Mirror and Channel 4s Humans. I knew I wanted to create such a drama with similar moralistic and thought provoking narrative with a dynamic and talented cast. With the script written, actors lined up and a fantastic crew put together, we have the making of a great short film that we want to share with you. Any donation is welcome and we can wait to showcase The Ambrosia Effect!

<h3>THE BIG AUDITION</h3>
<p>The Big Audition is a show about a group of Theatre Artists who set out to start a Youth Actor training organization in hopes of bettering the world.  Their plan is fool-proof, or so they think...  Obstacles come in the form of ego centric students,  fame crazed staff and counting on the Mafia for financial support.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I had a close high school friend who, after being incarcerated in jail for six months, developed a completely different  outlook on life following his release from jail. Exactly three months after his release he found himself behind bars again, this time for 3 years.</p>
<p>Growing up, the majority of the people released from prison that I knew either found themselves returning or marked with a scarlet letter to employers, preventing them from living a comfortable life. Unfortunately, mainstream media does not do much to address the contradiction.</p>
<p>However, there have been many cases where people came out of prison and became successful professionals. The purpose of From Prisoner to Professional is show people faced with similar situations that there is light at the end of the tunnel and to address the preconceived notions that those who have been to prison are doomed for life.</p>

<h3>What is Stuck? </h3>
<p>Stuck is a web series featuring four quirky ghosts that are trapped in the apartment in which they died. With the odds stacked against them, they search for ways to make the most out of their fate and refuse to let something like ""death"" weaken their ambitions.</p>
<p>As the FeLions we’ve performed at Chicago Sketchfest, Women’s Funny Fest and written, performed, and produced 2 sketch shows in the city.  Stuck is our first major collaborative writing project. Stuck is our baby and a project we believe in. We created Stuck as a way to explore the messy parts of life and adulthood.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS DEMONOLOGIST FOR HIRE?</h3>
<p>Demonologist For Hire is a web series set in a world where all manner of supernatural shenanigans takes place as part of everyday life. That weird noise you hear as you lie in bed at night? Probably a monster. That odd neighbour who only walks his dog at midnight? Probably a vampire. That thing you thought you saw out the corner of your eye that one time? Yup, probably an apparition. </p>
<p>For the most part all these otherworldly beings keep themselves to themselves, but what happens when one of them starts being a nuisance? You go online and find yourself a Demonologist to deal with it just as you would do with a plumber.</p>
<p>We're a Scottish web series which means we're bringing a very different vibe to this project. We have hundreds, nay, thousands of years of folklore and history to tap into not to mention the unique locations and accents. Did I mention the accents?  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?</h3>
<p>Though we financed the first season of Demonologist For Hire ourselves the production costs associated with the second season means that we can't do it alone.  We intend to use the money raised to produce <strong>four new web series episodes of Demonologist For Hire. </strong></p>
<p>We're extremely proud of our web series, and want to it look as good as it possibly can, but that takes money. Everyone we work with is an industry professional which is amazing but adds to the money needed to produce the series.  Our budget also includes hiring locations, which are never cheap, renting professional equipment, creature make-up, special effect shots and original music.</p>
<p>With this money we can increase our VFX budget which means more gore, more supernatural goings on and generally just more weirdness. </p>
<p>We know that donating money to any campaign is a risk, but we feel that as we're producing our second season of Demonologist For Hire we've already started our journey and we'd love you to come along with us for the ride!</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>In Gardenias we view the world through the eye's of Jay Melendez who has achieved the hight of fame on his Island of Puerto Rico as a Telemundo star, who decided to plant himself in Los Angeles to take his success to the next level. When he arrived, a rude awakening was waiting as he realized that it's not that easy to transition from a Telemundo star to having a Hollywood star on the walk of fame over night. Still with a home in Puerto Rico, an aunt on the island that he helps out financially, and a new life in Los Angeles he realized that he needed more money coming in while pursuing the next level of fame, so he took a job as a Hollywood tour guide. </p>

<h3>About the Project and Its Creator</h3>
<p>My name is Dylan Tyler and I am the creator, writer and director of the new T.V. series, ""Hoodlums."" I am a Fine &amp; Performing Arts graduate from the Johnny Carson School of Theatre &amp; Film. Currently, I am a freelance filmmaker in the Atlanta area trying to bring my vision to televisions across the country, as it has always been my dream to create powerful, original content.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, I have spent the past two and a half years conceptualizing and writing the entire series. My next question was: How do I make this real for the person who won't spend the time reading a 60 page pilot? I decided: why read what you can watch? So, I spent what little money I had (about $1K) to bring Hoodlums to the big screen. Now, I'm asking you to help me get HALF of that ($500), so I can bring Part II to the big screen, as well.</p>
<p>From there, I will continue to market Hoodlums, submit it to film festivals AND I will pitch it to studio executives to bring ALL of Hoodlums (not just 5 minutes) to those television across country I was talking about earlier. Let's get this thing from YouTube to HBO or Netflix!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need From You &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>In order for me to do this, I NEED your help! Whether it's one dollar or fifty dollars, all I need from each of you is whatever you can give. To sweeten the deal, I have listed below what each money value will get you from my production:</p>
<p>$1: Will receive a ""Special Thanks to"" in the credits.</p>
<p>$5: A personal shout-out on ""Facebook Live"" during the set-up and/or break in the shooting of Part II.</p>
<p>$10: The ability to be an extra in Part II and receive a copy of the finished scene on a flash drive</p>
<p>$25: Be an on-set guest for Part II and receive a copy of the finished scene on a flash drive</p>
<p>$50: A ""Producer"" credit in the final credits; Be an on-set guest for Part II; Receive a copy of the finished scene on a flash drive</p>
<p>$100: An ""Executive Producer"" credit in the final credits; Be an on-set guest for Part II; Receive a copy of the finished scene on a flash drive</p>
<p>$150+: An ""Executive Producer"" Credit in the final credits; a Full-Access Pass to the set of Part II and Behind-the-Scenes Access (including a Meet and Greet with the Cast of Part II); Receive a copy of the finished scene on a flash drive; Receive a Movie Poster for Hoodlums</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that this project is a unique story that has yet to be told. Especially in this racially- charged, highly- political climate, I believe a story about someone who is not only looking for an identity, but one that challenges racial boundaries and stereotypes, is uniquely pertinent. It also helps that this show has some sex appeal, as well.</p>
<p>Shows like Entourage, the Sopranos, The Wire  and Sons of Anarchy, explore not only the identity of the main character, but also establish the culture of the group around the show's main character. Hoodlums is constructed similarly; there is no true good-guy or bad-guy. This character-driven drama is meant to explore all of humanity--good and bad--to show where certain paths lead us--and how quickly they lead us there. This show is built for success because it follows that formula. The idea is to explore fictional characters in a real world--and, in most cases, the characters are based on real people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While money has been a hurdle, by far, the biggest challenge has been my overall lack of resources. I wrote, directed, produced, acted in and edited this show from start to its current state. While it is not perfect, it's a great launching off of point since I have had no help around me.</p>
<p>Due to this, I plan to finish the second part of this scene, and then sell it to someone who can take it further. I have enjoyed the past two and a half years and I look forward to working on this show as long as possible. But, at some point, you hope that someone else can come in and help do some of the heavy lifting..</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help Please, like, share and tell your friends. Even if you haven't a dime to spare, perhaps they do! And, how cool would it be to say, in a year or two, ""I helped get that show on T.V.""?</p>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","About the Project and Its Creator
My name is Dylan Tyler and I am the creator, writer and director of the new T.V. series, ""Hoodlums."" I am a Fine & Performing Arts graduate from the Johnny Carson School of Theatre & Film. Currently, I am a freelance filmmaker in the Atlanta area trying to bring my vision to televisions across the country, as it has always been my dream to create powerful, original content.
To achieve this goal, I have spent the past two and a half years conceptualizing and writing the entire series. My next question was: How do I make this real for the person who won't spend the time reading a 60 page pilot? I decided: why read what you can watch?

<h3>What About LaGina and Chanel?</h3>
<p>LaGina Hill and Chanel Carroll are the co-creators and stars of “What About Gayle?” Friends since their undergraduate days at N.Y.U.’s Tisch School of the Arts, LaGina and Chanel were looking for a project to collaborate on. After bonding over their fondness for all things O&amp;G, LaGina came up with the idea to write a stage show, set in the 1980s, LOOSELY based on the story of how Oprah and Gayle became friends. They spent a summer co-writing the stage version of the show and mounted it at The PIT during the summer of 2017. After a successful stage run, the ladies decided to turn their hit show into a six episode first season of a webseries of the same name.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What About Gayle is <strong>Zany, Heartwarming and Empowering to women.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this day and age, we wanted to create a series that not only made people laugh but highlighted the power that a strong friendship between two independent women had.</p>

<p>The first season of What About Gayle? consists of six, five to eight minute episodes. We’re hoping to shoot end of summer/early fall 2019.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000. This money will go towards the following:</p>

<p>Don't let the sarcastic tone of this campaign fool you, we're very grateful for all of the support we have received thus far on the webseries.

The pilot episode of TRANSFERS was recently released in August of 2018. Haven't seen it? You better get on that, friend. We plan to have a 5 episode season & we need your help to fund the rest of it!
You're back? Cool.
Imagine This: The pilot episode you just watched, but better. We're talking about camera quality, lighting, locations, cast, crew, set design, the whole shabang. 
We wanted to show you an episode made with minimum funds to give an idea of how great the show has the potential of being. In addition, we have already written the rest of the season, it just needs to be filmed!
WHOMSTVE?

The pilot episode of TRANSFERS was co-written & directed by Justin Shackelford. Justin has a background in film & business from the University of Texas, specializing in creative writing, directing, & editing. TRANSFERS is his passion project & he is using this as an opportunity to grow as a director, while also acting in the show.

<h3>Isolation The Series </h3>
<p>Thank you for stopping by on this campaign.</p>
<p>My name is Steve Leeds an Actor/Writer who created Isolation The Series at the begining of lockdown. I used over 80 actors worldwide filming in a way that has never been done before. </p>
<p>In the first Season of Isolation The Series, just our finale episode alone, reached OVER 145,000 views on the facebook page! </p>
<p>The whole project was filmed, edited and completed on a ZERO budget but is already rated 10/10 on IMDb!</p>
<p>This series has already gained a massive following all over the world.</p>
<p>The first season starred some big names such as Matt Lucas - little Britain, Jon Campling - Harry Potter, Jess Impiazzi, Tracey Birdsall filming her scenes in California, this is just a few of the very talented Actors that were involved.</p>

<p>This is a very troubling time for our industry. My aim here, is to keep as many creative people  around the world, working.</p>
<p> Just think, through this lockdown, I would almost guarantee all of you have watched a lot of films and series whilst at home am I right? That is why this series is so important  to keep as many Actors and other creatives employed.</p>
<h2><u><strong>How Does The Series Work </strong></u></h2>
<p>In the first season of Isolation The Series I wrote each Actors side of the scripts for their scene with directions. They filmed their scene on their phones or cameras. They then sent these back to me so I could edit their scene together with their scene partner, who was filming their side of the scene somewhere else in the world. </p>
<p>This is a brand new way of filming! No one got to see or know who their scene partners were, until the final edit of that episode. This is such an exciting way to film and created such a buzz.</p>
<p>Now imagine what we could do with a budget!</p>
<p>This would allow me to not only pay Actors for their time, it would allow me to pay editors, other writers, and many other creatives  to work together and build the biggest web-series out there!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><u>My Aim for Isolation The Series </u></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>I want this series to have it's own platform, it's own website, with weekly episodes.</p>
<p>After the support from the first season there is room for Isolation The Series to stand alone.</p>

This was one of the, if not the, first reason they declared war against them"".(Clone Robot model ""JJ650"", it is the most sold robot of the world. Unfortunately it's the first model rebel against humans).  In September 2049, Humans were already the minority, while Robots were multiplying exponentially. They used most of the natural resources and didn't have any respect for the environment. C7 (left) and C8 (right) outside in the Wasteland.  The World quickly became a WASTELAND with a vigilance of Robots that looked like humans who were after the few real humans who remained.It happened so fast and seemed to be the end... but there was still hope.Doctor Oid inside a DHARSA CORP Bunker.Some groups of people created ""Anti-Robots Bunkers"" that secured survivor shelters deep in the ground. They tried to organize and fight back.Some of these Bunkers were discovered by the robots, some people died of starvation, some by diseases, but there were just a few who were never discovered. On the surface, with the many years passing, a new generation of uncivilized humans were roaming the wasteland.C10 escape from a DHARSA Bunker into the Wasteland. Robots captured and enslaved most of them, just for the sake of it. Forcing the savages to do barbaric things.But once again, there was still hope...In May 2279, an ""Anti-Robot Bunker"" a group of scientists finally release a Team of fighters with the power of Robots, but the brains, intuitions and feelings of humans.It was a success and a new race was built with an exact balance between Robots and Humans called: ""CYBORGS"".Before the Robots found the bunker and destroy everything, 10 Cyborgs were built by a scientist called ""Doctor C"". The ""CYBORGS"" Team was created.

""Doctor C""  starts the CYBORGS GROUP.

<h2>Nu, What’s the show about?</h2>
<p>Jewishvibes is about the life of a modern orthodox Jewish high-schooler, named Mikey, who struggles with his religious values in the 21st century. Mikey has one foot in the religious world, with its many observances and ""restrictions,"" and one foot in the modern world, which at times can feel like the polar opposite of a religious upbringing. Mikey attends a religious Jewish high-school, but believes his life would be better if he transfers to a public school, where his dream of living the ""true American high-school experience"" would be fulfilled. </p>
<p>Jewishvibes was created by Mikey Greenblatt and developed by  Leah Gottfried (Soon By You),  Menachem Silverstein (Jimmy Kimmel Live, TBS, IFC), and Mikey Greenblatt (Magnet Theater). </p>
<h2>Why this?</h2>
<p>The goal of Jewishvibes is to bring awareness and understanding of the modern orthodox Jewish community. I have faced discrimination, prejudice, and anti-semitism living in New York City, which is considered by many as an accepting and open environment. What I have come to realize is that many of these attacks did not come from a place of hate, but rather a place of  misunderstanding and misinformation. I hope this project will bring to light the Jewish experience, in a fun and educational way. I want to bring this show into the mainstream. It is my belief that all of humanity has a shared set of values and emotions, and the key to combating prejudice and discrimination is to bring them into the open. A sense of commonality with your fellow human being not only dissipates hate, but accentuates love.</p>
<h2>Why you? </h2>
<p> If you think of a meme as a short film (which Mikey Greenblatt apparently does), then this NYC based comedian and co-founder of the Instagram account @Jewishvibes, has written well over 700 comedic films about the Modern Orthodox experience #frommemetoscreen.  Jewishvibes is simply the next step in the process. Mikey has also made several short sketches, which you can find here:</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 30px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why now?</span></p>
<p>This is a project that has not been done before. It is an insight into another culture that I hope will humanize the modern orthodox Jewish community. The portrayal of Jews on television seems to straddle two extreme sides of the spectrum: on the one hand there are culturally Jewish shows like Seinfeld, and on the other, ultra orthodox Jewish shows, such as Netflix's Unorthodox. Yet, Judaism is not monolithic, black or white. There is complexity and nuance to our religion. </p>
<p>I would not have been able to make this show a decade ago. For a show to be greenlighted, or put on the air by stations like NBC or CBS, it had to have mass appeal. Thanks to YouTube and hopefully down the line, streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, there is more room for shows like Jewishvibes.</p>

<h2><strong>The Only Way Out Is In</strong></h2>
<p>One Cuckoo is a web series that tells the story of Alix, a fiercely opinionated, highly imaginative, joyful and brash 30-something African-American artist in NYC and her mischievous trio of eclectic inner voices as she (and they) attempt to navigate the rocky waters of relationships, artistic pursuits, and self examination. It is a personal yet universal story that pits Alix against parts of herself that take form as: A full-grown, nebbishy jew with an insouciant, teen-ager's attitude, a flamboyant, always-right, wine swilling, British artiste, and a potty mouthed six-year-old. The series charts Alix's attempt to quiet these voices once and for all. Or at least broker a truce!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The team has already raised over $10,000.00 toward this project! We are poised to continue raising the necessary funds via InDemand, to bring you a gritty, beautiful, multi-ethnic, whimsical 6- webisode series depicting Alix's world and the motley crew of voices that make up her inner life. </p>
</div><div>
<p>According to Vickie Tanner, the series creator, the series is based on our current political climate and the misconception we are divided. <i>One Cuckoo</i> has an all-inclusive demographic: Women in their teens, 20’s and 30’s, artists, actors, businessmen and women, everyday people struggling in relationships and life, spiritual seekers and inhabiters of hip cosmopolitan cities, large and small. The multi-ethnic cast (and crew) are very deliberate, reflecting a true New York experience, where all peoples are represented and interact on an intimate basis. <i>One Cuckoo</i> is a mash-up of categories (drama, comedy and fantasy) and speaks to Me Too, Times Up, Black Lives Matter and identity politics. It calls out this chaotic time in history where we believe we are all divided and offers an alternative point of view: Division doesn’t really exist until we create it.</p>

<h3>Our Team</h3>
<p>Actor-writer-producer Vickie Tanner manifests her own experiences through truthful and compelling characters who ground her fantastical vision of the world. Vickie is also an actor, and author of solo play, <a href=""https://www.vickietanner.com/press"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Running Into Me</a>, which she has performed in Edinburgh, L.A. and various theatres in NYC to rave reviews. She is currently in rehearsals for a new feature film: <a href=""https://www.seedandspark.com/fund/paris-is-in-harlem#updates/21056"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paris is in Harlem</a> with writer/director Christina Kallas</p>

</div></div>","The Only Way Out Is In
One Cuckoo is a web series that tells the story of Alix, a fiercely opinionated, highly imaginative, joyful and brash 30-something African-American artist in NYC and her mischievous trio of eclectic inner voices as she (and they) attempt to navigate the rocky waters of relationships, artistic pursuits, and self examination. It is a personal yet universal story that pits Alix against parts of herself that take form as: A full-grown, nebbishy jew with an insouciant, teen-ager's attitude, a flamboyant, always-right, wine swilling, British artiste, and a potty mouthed six-year-old. The series charts Alix's attempt to quiet these voices once and for all. Or at least broker a truce!


What We Need & What You Get
The team has already raised over $10,000.00 toward this project! We are poised to continue raising the necessary funds via InDemand, to bring you a gritty, beautiful, multi-ethnic, whimsical 6- webisode series depicting Alix's world and the motley crew of voices that make up her inner life. 

According to Vickie Tanner, the series creator, the series is based on our current political climate and the misconception we are divided. One Cuckoo has an all-inclusive demographic: Women in their teens, 20’s and 30’s, artists, actors, businessmen and women, everyday people struggling in relationships and life, spiritual seekers and inhabiters of hip cosmopolitan cities, large and small. The multi-ethnic cast (and crew) are very deliberate, reflecting a true New York experience, where all peoples are represented and interact on an intimate basis. One Cuckoo is a mash-up of categories (drama, comedy and fantasy) and speaks to Me Too, Times Up, Black Lives Matter and identity politics. It calls out this chaotic time in history where we believe we are all divided and offers an alternative point of view: Division doesn’t really exist until we create it.


Our Team
Actor-writer-producer Vickie Tanner manifests her own experiences through truthful and compelling characters who ground her fantastical vision of the world. Vickie is also an actor, and author of solo play, Running Into Me, which she has performed in Edinburgh, L.A. and various theatres in NYC to rave reviews. She is currently in rehearsals for a new feature film: Paris is in Harlem with writer/director Christina Kallas
Director Jess Coles brings her perspective as a queer New York native to this tale of blurred boundaries between reality and illusion, inner self and outer self, and what it means to create a vision of oneself with no prior mold to follow. Jess and Vickie’s collaboration started in John Shear’s Take Action Film Collective, where their work together on gender bending scenes spurred a lasting partnership

Lead actress, Olivia Washington is following in the footsteps of her famous father but forging her own path! She has been seen in Lee Daniel’s The Butler, Mr. Robot, a recent collaboration on a short film with director Jess Coles and many plays across the country.
Director of Photography, Katherine Castro studied architecture and photography while living in the Dominican Republic. She brings her design and photography background to work that spans narrative, music video & doc- umentaries. Her work has recently been screened in film festivals such as Indy Film Fest, Woods Hole Film Festival & Asian American International Film Festival in NYC.
Stan Meyer is a world-renown artist and Broadway set designer who gave us Beauty and the Beast and many other plays. Stan will be creating the beautiful, staggered, painted photographs you just saw in the teaser video for the entire series.

<h3>What in the heck is Bear Apocalypse?</h3>
<p>Corey and Brad are two best friends reunited in the wilderness after being forced out of their homes by the bears. Now that they're back together, they must face the everyday challenges of living in a world gone mad, where the bears reign supreme and humans fight for survival. </p>
<p><i>Bear Apocalypse </i>is a comedy web series comprised of approximately 6-8 episodes, with a run time of 8-10 minutes per episode. Before we can get there, though, we need to make an amazing Pilot episode to use as a proof of concept to bring the whole season to life.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Whatcha need a hand with?</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise funds to cover everything associated with the production of our pilot episode. This includes gear rentals, crew honorariums, special makeup effects, VFX, and sound mixing. A lot goes into making something look good and we appreciate any help you can offer in assisting us achieve our goals. From where we stand, your contributions will help us cover the following:</p>
<p>Gear / Camera Rental: <strong>$1,000</strong></p>

We're currently at the pilot stage, and we plan on using it to take the show to series. We've been featured in Peoria area media, most notably WMBD-TV, where we officially announced the show. The show immediately caught the attention of viewers and has been growing in popularity ever since. With all the buzz surrounding our show, and after producing a trailer and wrapping principal photography on a full-length 30 minute pilot, we are now looking to fund the post-production process in order to complete and air the pilot with plans to go to to series soon after! We have assembled a great cast and crew to make it happen. We need your help to fund the next step!

The show is about the interesting quirks of a mid-western town, and the unique personalities that reside there as told through the perspective of a group of friends who represent different walks of life. PEORIA touches on a number of issues that are both local in nature and universal in appeal including education, health care, and environmental sustainability and regulations.

From an entertainment standpoint the potential is clear and we aim to produce a show that not only makes each viewer feel better by the end of the episode, but also touches on hot button issues like the current political landscape, the media industrial complex, and the socioeconomic disparities between different classes while making sure to treat them with the depth and complexity that they deserve.</p><p>From an economic standpoint, we plan on buying and shooting locally. We are confident that this will help the Peoria economy by bringing more people to both the immediate area, and to the state of Illinois due to the wide appeal of the show. We are be bringing in talent from all over the country as well as emphasizing our vast local talent. Out-of-town cast and crew members will stay here while shooting and will support our local businesses while in town. </p><p>We are always looking to cast locally and hire crew from the area.

We're currently at the pilot stage, and we plan on using it to take the show to series. We've been featured in Peoria area media, most notably WMBD-TV, where we officially announced the show. The show immediately caught the attention of viewers and has been growing in popularity ever since. With all the buzz surrounding our show, and after producing a trailer and wrapping principal photography on a full-length 30 minute pilot, we are now looking to fund the post-production process in order to complete and air the pilot with plans to go to to series soon after! We have assembled a great cast and crew to make it happen. We need your help to fund the next step! Thank you!https://www.centralillinoisproud.com/news/local... https://www.centralillinoisproud.com/news/local...OFFICIAL TRAILER


 


 Produced by River City Productions and created in 2015 by Peoria area filmmaker Michael Mcgruder, PEORIA is a lighthearted drama with comedic elements. The show is about the interesting quirks of a mid-western town, and the unique personalities that reside there as told through the perspective of a group of friends who represent different walks of life. PEORIA touches on a number of issues that are both local in nature and universal in appeal including education, health care, and environmental sustainability and regulations. It also explores the difficulties each individual faces in both their personal and professional lives, and how they navigate the conflicts thrown at them, and ultimately become better people for it!PEORIA was created for a number of reasons, and it's very near and dear to my heart due to the local nature of it. They always say to write what you know, and what I've found is that there is a great deal of material right here in my own backyard. From an entertainment standpoint the potential is clear and we aim to produce a show that not only makes each viewer feel better by the end of the episode, but also touches on hot button issues like the current political landscape, the media industrial complex, and the socioeconomic disparities between different classes while making sure to treat them with the depth and complexity that they deserve.From an economic standpoint, we plan on buying and shooting locally. We are confident that this will help the Peoria economy by bringing more people to both the immediate area, and to the state of Illinois due to the wide appeal of the show. We are be bringing in talent from all over the country as well as emphasizing our vast local talent. Out-of-town cast and crew members will stay here while shooting and will support our local businesses while in town. We are always looking to cast locally and hire crew from the area. We are providing people of all ages and backgrounds who are interested in television production the opportunity to get involved both in front of and behind the camera.We will also be engaged with the community on a deeply personal level, and will be giving back every opportunity we get.Born and raised in Peoria, Illinois, local filmmaker Michael Mcgruder has been in show business from a very young age.

His most recent production was play called ""Once In A While"", that succesfully played at the Apollo Theater in downtown Peoria in Spring of 2019. Mcgruder began marinating on his vision for ""Peoria"" in 2015, and began the casting process in February 2020. This is his most ambitious project yet; and he is so grateful for the cast and crew who have become involved thus far. He is looking forward to showing the world all of the local talent and beauty that comes from his hometown by naming his newest creation, ""Peoria"", with hopes to forever encapsulate the wealth of material provided by this wonderful city. Raynah Unes-Reid began her relationship with the arts at the age of four when she started her dance training.

You'll recognize a little of yourself in Charlie Fuller, an aspiring filmmaker and the small but determined varsity quarterback--Hailey, his cheerleader best friend--Damian, his troubled cousin--Lamar, a transfer student with a mysterious past--Blake, the nerdy tech wiz and camera man--and Britney, the preppy class president and ruling journalism queen.  Teenage drama rears it's head on a regular basis...and when Hailey's mom steps in as the teams football coach, things get even trickier. But our heroes face their challenges and, ultimately, become stronger.  Together. What makes us different?Harbor City is a teen drama that keeps it real with characters and situations that you can relate to.  Shows such as Supernatural or Teen Wolf may be similar, but Harbor City’s story lines are filled with real issues facing teens today.  Whether it's dealing with a mental illness, choosing between parents or anything in between, Harbor City will give you somebody or something to root for and leave you hungry for the next episode.The TeamWriter – Justin FernandezJustin Fernandez is a Writer/Director/Actor based out of Ventura County.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i><strong>AESOP Episodic Series</strong></i><br/>The year is 3021. A millennia after the nuclear holocaust. Earth has reverted to a second dark age. What’s left of humanity wars among itself, threatening the extinction of mankind. Vision tells of a gifted seer, the boy Aesop who some count as daft. He must be brought to the king, his council heeded, or all will be irrevocably lost.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Julie-Anne Liechty, the creator of AESOP. Three years ago, we started filming the pilot for this post-apocalyptic medieval series, starring a high-functioning autistic boy in the title role. The story is about this boy who must prove himself as a great seer, despite his seeming challenges, and unite a deeply divided world that is on the brink of utter destruction, in a decimated land ruined by the foolishness of their ancestors. </p>
<p>Why have we waited three years to finish it? Lack of funds and energy and I had some pretty serious health issues that had to be overcome.</p>
<p>But now we are back and have been filming like crazy for the last several months. We have just two scenes left to shoot (a tavern scene and a scene in a palace) and need your help to get them done. We have been doing everything on a shoestring budget and want to rent two spectacular locations for those last two scenes. So we are reaching out to you!</p>
<p>Become a part of the AESOP family and help this epic tale find its way to millions.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i><strong>Our plan is:</strong></i></p>
<p>Finish the pilot and the scripts for the entire first season which will include ten 45-min to 60-min episodes. Then pitch the project to a streaming company in hopes of it getting picked up and fully produced.</p>
<p>To finish the pilot, we need $5,500. This will cover the costs of the two locations (see below for pictures), plus get insurance to film at them and help with set dressings and more costumes because we’d like to have a lot a background actors. All of these things will boost production value which will make our project more appealing to larger production companies.</p>
<p>We’ve done the math – if 270 people contribute $20 each, we’ll have reached our goal!</p>
<p><i><strong>Expenses Broken Down:</strong></i></p>
<p>Rental of The Crooked Tavern at Evermore<br/>Rental of the Provo Courthouse<br/>Insurance fees<br/>Costume and set dressing:<br/>Indiegogo’s cut<br/>Total</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Location 1 - The Crooked Lantern Tavern at Evermore</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>What you’ll get:</strong></i> (see Perks below) Depending on the amount of your contribution, you will get the following – a personal thank you in the credits, a chance to spend time with a Friesian stallion, an exclusive copy of the finished pilot, being a featured extra in one of the scenes, and even getting a character named after you!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support of our project will make all the difference!</p>
<p>The story of AESOP is about ending divisiveness, uniting humanity, overcoming what many think of as insurmountable challenges. It has the potential to touch the lives of millions, encourage and inspire them to carry on despite increasingly difficult times. And it’s highly entertaining. You will be bringing that to the world!</p>
<p>You will also be helping to grow the force of filmmaking here in Utah – in the United States – in the “outside of Hollywood” arena. The more we create here, the more we contribute to and strengthen the world’s film community.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i><strong>Risks: </strong></i>Filmmaking is risky. What if we fall flat on our face? Get turned down by Netflix and everyone else? What if we don’t meet our funding goal? All we can do is try. We believe in this story and in this project and we believe others will fall in love with it too. And if we don’t meet our funding goals, we’ll still finish the pilot as we are wizards at spinning straw into gold.</p>
<p><i><strong>Challenges:</strong></i> Our biggest challenge with AESOP is connecting to production companies that have the capital to get the series fully produced. We have a few possible leads but are looking for guidance and assistance with that aspect of the production. We are open to any other possibilities.</p>

AESOP Episodic SeriesThe year is 3021. A millennia after the nuclear holocaust. Earth has reverted to a second dark age. What’s left of humanity wars among itself, threatening the extinction of mankind. Vision tells of a gifted seer, the boy Aesop who some count as daft. He must be brought to the king, his council heeded, or all will be irrevocably lost.
-----
Hi, I’m Julie-Anne Liechty, the creator of AESOP. Three years ago, we started filming the pilot for this post-apocalyptic medieval series, starring a high-functioning autistic boy in the title role. The story is about this boy who must prove himself as a great seer, despite his seeming challenges, and unite a deeply divided world that is on the brink of utter destruction, in a decimated land ruined by the foolishness of their ancestors. 
Why have we waited three years to finish it? Lack of funds and energy and I had some pretty serious health issues that had to be overcome.
But now we are back and have been filming like crazy for the last several months. We have just two scenes left to shoot (a tavern scene and a scene in a palace) and need your help to get them done. We have been doing everything on a shoestring budget and want to rent two spectacular locations for those last two scenes. So we are reaching out to you!
Become a part of the AESOP family and help this epic tale find its way to millions.

Roque (Lenni Uitto), Am'Celeena (Julie-Anne Liechty) and Nessa (Deven Sky)
 
Here is the script for the tavern scene: 






Petris Na'Varr (Chase Elwood) at his scrying table.
 
And this is the script for the palace scene: 






 

Aesop (Jaxson Fisher) and his mother Aria (Amy Arburn)
 
What We Need & What You Get
Our plan is:
Finish the pilot and the scripts for the entire first season which will include ten 45-min to 60-min episodes. Then pitch the project to a streaming company in hopes of it getting picked up and fully produced.
To finish the pilot, we need $5,500. This will cover the costs of the two locations (see below for pictures), plus get insurance to film at them and help with set dressings and more costumes because we’d like to have a lot a background actors. All of these things will boost production value which will make our project more appealing to larger production companies.
We’ve done the math – if 270 people contribute $20 each, we’ll have reached our goal!
Expenses Broken Down:
Rental of The Crooked Tavern at EvermoreRental of the Provo CourthouseInsurance feesCostume and set dressing:Indiegogo’s cutTotal
Location 1 - The Crooked Lantern Tavern at Evermore

 
Location 2 - The Historic Courthouse in Provo

 
What you’ll get: (see Perks below) Depending on the amount of your contribution, you will get the following – a personal thank you in the credits, a chance to spend time with a Friesian stallion, an exclusive copy of the finished pilot, being a featured extra in one of the scenes, and even getting a character named after you!


Bandis (Noah Kershisnik) and Roque (Lenni Uitto)
The Impact
Your support of our project will make all the difference!
The story of AESOP is about ending divisiveness, uniting humanity, overcoming what many think of as insurmountable challenges. It has the potential to touch the lives of millions, encourage and inspire them to carry on despite increasingly difficult times. And it’s highly entertaining. You will be bringing that to the world!
You will also be helping to grow the force of filmmaking here in Utah – in the United States – in the “outside of Hollywood” arena. The more we create here, the more we contribute to and strengthen the world’s film community.


Aesop (Jaxson Fisher), Roque (Lenni Uitto), Scrap (Lorenzo Silva), Beauty (Sam Huntsman), Bandis (Stunt double and horse wrangler Jared Gray). Horses: Odin, Arthur, Bane and Rowdy
Risks & Challenges
Risks: Filmmaking is risky. What if we fall flat on our face? Get turned down by Netflix and everyone else? What if we don’t meet our funding goal? All we can do is try. We believe in this story and in this project and we believe others will fall in love with it too. And if we don’t meet our funding goals, we’ll still finish the pilot as we are wizards at spinning straw into gold.
Challenges: Our biggest challenge with AESOP is connecting to production companies that have the capital to get the series fully produced. We have a few possible leads but are looking for guidance and assistance with that aspect of the production. We are open to any other possibilities.

<h3>Hey there!</h3>
<p>Ruthy Froch (NYU/Tisch Drama) and Stephanie Spector (CU Boulder) came together to create (im)mature because we were sick of the same old, unrealistic television portrayals of young people in New York City.  We want to portray the real lives of diverse young people in the big apple, in the way that shows before us have missed the mark.   We are committed to telling the real stories of diverse young people struggling to find themselves, which we hope will resonate both with our peers while also appealing to audiences of every age.  </p>
<p>We are operating on a shoestring budget but there are some expenses that are unavoidable.  We need help funding production costs such as equipment rentals, location fees, and (a little) compensation for our artists. Your help would be an enormous gift to our project and to creating this story, which we believe will be just as important to our peers as it is to us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you can do and what you can get* (hint: *prezzies!)</h3>
<p>A Closer Look:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be a bit more specific, we are looking to raise 7,000 dollars to produce and film our first seven episodes of (im)mature which would culminate in the completion of our first season. (YAY!) So to break it down thats 7,000 dollars, 7 episodes, 1,000 dollars per episode.</li>
<li>Your help, if we are lucky enough to have it, would help us pay for equipment fees and rentals, location fees, helping to keep (im)mature series on its feet and alive, and most importantly paying our fantastic crew and artists who are contributing to and helping to create this story.</li>
<li>We have several exciting perks in return for your generous contribution, including a day on set, a night out with the cast, and a storyline or character you want to tell included on the show!</li>
<li>We are committed to creating this project, regardless of whether we reach our goal. If we do not reach our goal, we will have to make do with what we get--that would mean: our sound quality would be significantly lower making outdoor shots &amp; crowded indoor shots, we would not be able to compensate our artists, we would have to lower our quality of equipment rentals, and have difficulty finding a quality cinematographer who would have to spend ample amounts of time for little to no compensation. HOWEVER, with your help we can reach our goal and create a series with as high quality and low budget as possible!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Wait, why should I care?</h3>
<p>We believe there is a disparity in the way life in your 20's in New York City is portrayed and what it is like to actually live that life:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is important for people to see themselves reflected in the art and media they consume.  When people see their stories, struggles and successes being portrayed on TV, they feel validated in their experiences and know that they are not alone.  </li>
<li>Being female writers, creators, producers, comedians, we are committed to involving as many female filmmakers as possible in the production of (im)mature. AND with the help of our other series regulars Sergio King and Tyler Jimenez we are working to create diverse characters and stories.</li>
<li>Although, Ruthy minored in producing at NYU/Tisch and has produced several theatrical ventures and has created and edited some of her own film content, this her first venture in creating something on this scale. We understand the risk in donating in our project, considering this is a new experience for both of us, which is why we added Cici Sutter to our producing and creative team. She is currently studying film at NYU and has extensive experience in ventures just like ours! We assure you that we have done our research and are equally inspired and committed to see this project to it's fullest potential.</li>

<p>Hi there, we hope you like our idea. Following on from our award nominated sketch show The Age of Enlightenment, we're keen to bring a fresh new comedy show that will get everyone laughing - whether you're a football enthusiast or not. We made great progress with the sketch show, opening doors and getting people talking about us. Now we need to demonstrate that we can make a traditional hit sitcom, consisting of core characters in familiar settings. This project is an introduction to how we can bring those sort of characters into the world.</p>
<p>Now to introduce ourselves. We're Ben, Daryll and Kyle and we write, perform and produce comedy. We've come from different backgrounds, but we all share one unique passion for the genre. Here's a bit about us individually:</p>
<h3><strong>Bios</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ben Kent</strong> has loads of experience in making people laugh. He has written and directed a number of award winning short films, music videos and adverts, specialising in comedy. He has also won an Academy Award for his work in VFX. After the success of his short horror comedy Love Bug (which played at over 50 festivals and was picked up for worldwide distribution), Ben has recently gone on to write and direct his first feature film, F.U.B.A.R., starring, amongst others, comedy legend Mark Heap.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Eaton</strong> has written and performed in several comedy troupes that have toured all over the UK, including two appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Funny or Die commissioned two sketches for him, which comedy legend Matt Lucas directed resulting in hundreds of thousands of views across various online platforms. He worked with Ben on their award nominated online sketch show 'The Age of Enlightenment', which they created together. The show reached hundreds of thousands of viewers, picking up frequent coverage on Funny or Die, features in The Huffington Post and The British Comedy Guide and gathered many fans from the UK and US. He was also one of TV Gold's Christmas Cracker Joke of the Year award winners in 2017. </p>
<p><strong>Daryll James</strong> is a writer and performer who has worked on many film and TV treatments, submitting concepts to various institutions including Writers Room and Blaps, he likes to seize every opportunity. He formed a company with Kyle at college, and together they have made TV tasters, performed live shows up and down the country including two stints at the Edinburgh Fringe and devised plays and workshops. They are close friends and the warmth they have for eachother off screen is very much evident on screen as well.</p>
<h3><strong>What does this mean to us?</strong></h3>
<p>Everything - this campaign is so very important to all three of us, as we so want to follow up our work to date with the best possible show we can. We genuinely feel Off the Ball is ripe for TV, and we just need to get commissioners' attention with it. By creating the best looking, best sounding and best written web series we can we don't see any reason why we can't continue the upward trend set with our past projects and grow it further.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So we're looking to raise £2500. This amount will allow us to shoot nine web episodes - three stories for each character.</p>
<p>This money will pay for the hire of camera, light and sound equipment. It will cover the expenses of all the cast and crew. It will help us secure the best locations, giving our characters a world to live in.</p>
<p>If we can't raise the full amount, every penny will go towards helping us realise our collective dream of making the best new comedy web series we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't in a position to help us out financially, that's fine. But if you like the idea then please help to get the word out and make some noise about Off the Ball. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A dying man, woman too insignificant to change anything (or so she thought, of course) and only 107 years between them. A time travel and 'forbidden' romance after, a question appears - if a painter can indeed save the man she loves, what will be the price they'll have to pay?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>This heartwarming romantic comedy mini-series will invite you on the journey not only through time but into a storm of emotions that the main character, Emma Luthain, a shy and low-esteemed painter from 1910 goes through after being suddenly transported into present time, with no way of knowing what became of her friend and her ill daughter. </p>
<p>'Rescued' by Shawn Truid, eager to help her get back to her time, she is continuously shocked by the changes that happened through the century, while definitely being relieved that it was Shawn who found her after the jump to 2017. All would be nice and rosy, they'd fall in love with each other and forget all about the time travel... Well, they do fall in love with each other, but there's no chance for a 'happily ever after' - Shawn is dying for an untreatable genetical illness. Emma seems to be hopeless, as her only skill - painting - cannot save him. Or could it?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>About Me &amp; The Production Preparation</h2>
<p>For the last 7 years I was learning how to make movies, and apart from a heap of screenplays that I deemed not worthy of production, I made these three short films:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/173861406?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/174905140?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/189487008?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>And of course, I spent big part of that time on preparing 'Skipping Tomorrows', as there's a lot of work to get a mini-series ready for production. I came as far as my own work can take me, but to get great people on my team costs, as does the wardrobe, props, securing the locations and bringing the actors from outside the Yukon. It doesn't come as a surprise to me and I saved up as much as I could ($2,500) but it still leaves me with $3,500 to gather.</p>
<p>In the film world it is really little, but still, I cannot make this episode without that. If you are such an amazing person that you will support this campaign, you help us bring the production closer to reality and you will help us convince private investors (that we'll be turning to after this campaign) 'yes, there are people who want to watch this series'.</p>
<p>And most of all, when you will help us make this first episode of 'Skipping Tomorrows', you bring us so much closer to producing the whole series as well! After watching our awesome pilot episode, who wouldn't want to help us make the rest? But for now all we have is a bunch of papers (very important for the production, but just papers nonetheless) and a promise that we'll do all in our power to make this series the best it can be. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is challenging to take on a project more difficult and complicated than the previous one, but what is life without a challenge every now and then?</p>
<p>I prepared as much as I could during the pre-production, so there will be no setbacks due to negligence, but there are still risks no one can eradicate simply by preparation: someone from the crew or cast could get sick for example, causing delay, a need to reschedule and a budget increase.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
A dying man, woman too insignificant to change anything (or so she thought, of course) and only 107 years between them. A time travel and 'forbidden' romance after, a question appears - if a painter can indeed save the man she loves, what will be the price they'll have to pay?
​
This heartwarming romantic comedy mini-series will invite you on the journey not only through time but into a storm of emotions that the main character, Emma Luthain, a shy and low-esteemed painter from 1910 goes through after being suddenly transported into present time, with no way of knowing what became of her friend and her ill daughter. 
'Rescued' by Shawn Truid, eager to help her get back to her time, she is continuously shocked by the changes that happened through the century, while definitely being relieved that it was Shawn who found her after the jump to 2017. All would be nice and rosy, they'd fall in love with each other and forget all about the time travel... Well, they do fall in love with each other, but there's no chance for a 'happily ever after' - Shawn is dying for an untreatable genetical illness. Emma seems to be hopeless, as her only skill - painting - cannot save him. Or could it?
 
About Me & The Production Preparation
For the last 7 years I was learning how to make movies, and apart from a heap of screenplays that I deemed not worthy of production, I made these three short films:





 
And of course, I spent big part of that time on preparing 'Skipping Tomorrows', as there's a lot of work to get a mini-series ready for production. I came as far as my own work can take me, but to get great people on my team costs, as does the wardrobe, props, securing the locations and bringing the actors from outside the Yukon. It doesn't come as a surprise to me and I saved up as much as I could ($2,500) but it still leaves me with $3,500 to gather.
In the film world it is really little, but still, I cannot make this episode without that. If you are such an amazing person that you will support this campaign, you help us bring the production closer to reality and you will help us convince private investors (that we'll be turning to after this campaign) 'yes, there are people who want to watch this series'.
And most of all, when you will help us make this first episode of 'Skipping Tomorrows', you bring us so much closer to producing the whole series as well! After watching our awesome pilot episode, who wouldn't want to help us make the rest? But for now all we have is a bunch of papers (very important for the production, but just papers nonetheless) and a promise that we'll do all in our power to make this series the best it can be.

<h3><strong>ABOUT THE CREATORS  </strong></h3>
<p>I’m Evelyn Seubert, the co-creator of SANATIONE.  My life’s dream was to work with young people in the visual arts, specifically film and video.  And that’s what I’ve been doing for the last 21 years.  In 2006, I co-founded the International Youth Media Summit (IYMS) whose goal is to bring young international filmmakers together to bring positive change to the world through collaborative media projects. Every year IYMS hosts our annual Summit in a different country.  We were scheduled to meet in Croatia in July 2020, but the pandemic forced the Summit online. By then our SANATIONE filmmakers were already working across borders.  Co-creator Anne Drecktrah had organized folks with cellphones in the U.S. and co-creator Sapan Hamal and I organized filmmakers in other countries.  </p>
<h3><strong>THE SERIES</strong></h3>
<p>SANATIONE is a web series of 15-minute videos that are inspired by the drastic impact of Covid-19.  We have recruited over 30 filmmakers from 22 countries, including Bangladesh, Croatia, Egypt, Ghana, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Sweden and the USA. Our team firmly believes we can have a positive impact from such a negative event.  That is who we are. </p>

<h2>CAMPAIGN REMAINS LIVE:</h2>
<p>With a commitment from WBRA Blue Ridge PBS to air Penny P's Backyard, and to be the representing station for a nationally syndicated broadcast, we are keeping our campaign live.  Primarily, the money will go to grant writing and the writing of the first 13 episodes in the series.  Please donate and help us keep this momentum.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><i>Penny P's Backyard: The Core Story</i></strong></h2>
<p>Penny P’s Backyard is a new family show being developed that looks at the intersections of Science, Nature, and American Folk Art/Culture.   Main character <strong>Penny P</strong>, age 10 and her three friends <strong>Ramp</strong> (10), <strong>Nelly</strong> (10) and <strong>Sadie</strong> 9), aka the core four, belong to an after school film club.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570585058/jbcmgtahncqwojee9bpy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Through Penny P’s short films, documentaries, and animations the primary narrative themes of the wonderment that exists at the intersection of Science, Nature and American Folk Art, of all shades, will be portrayed.  All the while, subtly introducing the language and practice of DIY film making to a generation of media and tech-savvy youth. </p>
<p>An example of an intersection between American Folk Art and Science would be in a conversation with a Geologist about how the Appalachian Mountains were formed, topics like heat, pressure, and the bending and folding of the earth would be explored to describe the processes and end result of plate tectonics.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570629629/gqklffugqqrzo8d0rt1j.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A folk artist that would use near-identical terminology, in the world of folk art, are potters and blacksmiths. Who uses heat and pressure to bend or fold earthen materials, into their creations.</p>

<p>Other concepts may include, but are not limited to; Basketweavers and the varying types of bird nests, light refraction/the color spectrum and glass blowing, canning/smoking for food preservation and microbiology, tree rings/wood grains and Luthiers, The Fibonacci/Pi sequence in nature, the geometry of quilts, the physics of mobiles, the mathematics of fiddle music.   <strong>And more!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Every episode</strong>, the core four are given a video or animation project assignment from film club mentor Vanover. This assignment, driven by Penny’s love of natural science and folk art/culture, spurs on a production adventure in search of the projects subject matter in and around Penny P’s Backyard.  Thus opening a world of interconnections between Science, Nature, and American Folk Art.   Like the small mountain college town, she calls home,</p>

<p><strong>Penny P's Backyard</strong> is designed to open a family's viewpoint of what the interconnections between Science, Folk Art, and Nature is.  It will challenge them to look at the Art of Science.  Or the Science of Art.  Or how Science and Art are influenced and inspired by Nature.  Set in the mountains of Southwestern Virginia, the show is designed to challenge the preconceived notions of what Appalachia (its people/culture) is.  And will represent a <strong>true positive portrayal</strong> of its people, art, and culture.  Not what the national media portrays, but an honest and heartfelt vision of all that is beautiful about Appalachia.  Towards that effort, this show will be a visual love letter to the mountains, people and places of Southwestern Virginia.</p>

With a commitment from WBRA Blue Ridge PBS to air Penny P's Backyard, and to be the representing station for a nationally syndicated broadcast, we are keeping our campaign live.  Primarily, the money will go to grant writing and the writing of the first 13 episodes in the series.  Please donate and help us keep this momentum.  
 
Penny P's Backyard: The Core Story
Penny P’s Backyard is a new family show being developed that looks at the intersections of Science, Nature, and American Folk Art/Culture.   Main character Penny P, age 10 and her three friends Ramp (10), Nelly (10) and Sadie 9), aka the core four, belong to an after school film club.   

Through Penny P’s short films, documentaries, and animations the primary narrative themes of the wonderment that exists at the intersection of Science, Nature and American Folk Art, of all shades, will be portrayed.  All the while, subtly introducing the language and practice of DIY film making to a generation of media and tech-savvy youth. 
An example of an intersection between American Folk Art and Science would be in a conversation with a Geologist about how the Appalachian Mountains were formed, topics like heat, pressure, and the bending and folding of the earth would be explored to describe the processes and end result of plate tectonics.  

A folk artist that would use near-identical terminology, in the world of folk art, are potters and blacksmiths. Who uses heat and pressure to bend or fold earthen materials, into their creations.

Other concepts may include, but are not limited to; Basketweavers and the varying types of bird nests, light refraction/the color spectrum and glass blowing, canning/smoking for food preservation and microbiology, tree rings/wood grains and Luthiers, The Fibonacci/Pi sequence in nature, the geometry of quilts, the physics of mobiles, the mathematics of fiddle music.   And more!
Every episode, the core four are given a video or animation project assignment from film club mentor Vanover. This assignment, driven by Penny’s love of natural science and folk art/culture, spurs on a production adventure in search of the projects subject matter in and around Penny P’s Backyard.  Thus opening a world of interconnections between Science, Nature, and American Folk Art.   Like the small mountain college town, she calls home,

And the adjacent university where her mother works as Dean of Natural Sciences and the Environment.

 
Also,  all the mountain top hideaways and bends around curvy country roads brimming with folklife her Daddy, a local woodworker, and musician, always seems to know his way to.

And in doing so, puts the core four in contact with a host of unique characters, while learning age-appropriate themes of teamwork, respect for self, others, place and the environment, sense of community, life skills and humor.

Main character Penny P  sees the world around her as a continuous stream of interconnections. Her father's world of folk art culture mixes with her mother's world of science and technology to help shape how she sees the world around her.

Sadie has a love of all things electric. She is a skilled dumpster diver, and she knows all the good spots on the local university campus to find the various wires, metal, LEDs and electrical components she needs to make all the lights she uses to help Penny P create her video projects.

She's an encyclopedia of old movies and TV and because of this, she (we the creators) slide homages to famous shots and visuals from classic movies and TV shows from history and pepper them throughout Penny Ps videos. Penny P trusts Nelly to get the best shot possible. She has access to numerous camera toys as her father is a photography faculty on campus. She also collects all things made of glass and loves folk art made with glass as it's medium. 

Ramp is the audio engineer of the crew and b/c of this he experiences his world with a focus on how the world around him sounds. Along with Sadie, he dumpster dives at the choice spots on the local University campus. And he finds everything he needs to create the noises he needs for a library of foley sound effects.

<br/>ABOUT THE SERIES</h3><p><i>RECKLESS JULIETS</i> is an original, multi-award-winning, critically acclaimed, web series with a darkly comedic---and sometimes devastating---take on the secret lives of four, headstrong teenage girls. A cross between Heathers and The Virgin Suicides, the series follows the lifelong friends Carmody (Britni Raine), Wynn (Lelia Yvetta), Chloe (Sadie Eve), and Shasta (Natasha Stricklin) as they navigate their way through high school, womanhood, and hectic home lives.</p><p>We aren't like any web series that you've seen before. The large cast of characters are interesting and three dimensional. The storylines touch on mental heath, body image, suicide awareness, LGBTQIA representation, and most importantly, the complex nature of female friendship. </p><p>The first seven episodes are online for your viewing pleasure, but we need help to make the rest of our first season a reality. That's where, <strong><i>you</i></strong>, the fans come in. If you haven't seen any episodes yet, don't worry, they're all listed below for your convenience. You can also learn more about our incredibly talented cast and crew, see behind the scenes photos from set, and find out about the perks that you receive when you donate!</p><p>All donations go towards helping us shoot episodes eight through ten (the finale), and two shorter episodes. The money will go help pay actors, crew members, catering, location fees, permits, equipment rentals, wardrobe, production design, festival submission, marketing, and post-production. </p><p>Have a question?

ABOUT THE SERIESRECKLESS JULIETS is an original, multi-award-winning, critically acclaimed, web series with a darkly comedic---and sometimes devastating---take on the secret lives of four, headstrong teenage girls. A cross between Heathers and The Virgin Suicides, the series follows the lifelong friends Carmody (Britni Raine), Wynn (Lelia Yvetta), Chloe (Sadie Eve), and Shasta (Natasha Stricklin) as they navigate their way through high school, womanhood, and hectic home lives.We aren't like any web series that you've seen before. The large cast of characters are interesting and three dimensional. The storylines touch on mental heath, body image, suicide awareness, LGBTQIA representation, and most importantly, the complex nature of female friendship. The first seven episodes are online for your viewing pleasure, but we need help to make the rest of our first season a reality. That's where, you, the fans come in. If you haven't seen any episodes yet, don't worry, they're all listed below for your convenience. You can also learn more about our incredibly talented cast and crew, see behind the scenes photos from set, and find out about the perks that you receive when you donate!All donations go towards helping us shoot episodes eight through ten (the finale), and two shorter episodes.

Watching ""Reckless Juliets"" is like hanging out with the cool kids in high school who were always making bowls (for smoking, not eating) in art class and driving into the city on weekends for underground punk shows. It's a series about teen girls, but it's no ""Teen Girl Squad."" All of the characters feel fully-formed and getting to know them over the course of 6 episodes is highly enjoyable.' - WomanInRevolt.com'In “Reckless Juliets,” one of the web series offerings, four teenage girls have their friendship tested by unexpected tragedy. Creator Skyler Barrett walks a fine line between dark comedy and compelling drama, which helps set this coming of age story apart from the young adult fare that wades into melodrama or emotional manipulation...""'Created by Skyler Barrett, the show has a dark comedic edge that prevents the show from getting too self-serious without ever doing a disservice to its characters. As its name suggests, “Reckless Juliets” isn’t afraid of the volatility of teenage emotion...' - Women & Hollywood'The first season episodes of Reckless Juliets that have already arrived on YouTube are of top-notch quality. While it is a show about high school students, it is decidedly mature, both in terms of the way it portrays its characters and the skillful manner in which its slow-burning scenes are shot.'​ - TubefilterInterview with Follow MagazineFILM FESTIVALSWINNER First Glance Film Festival Philadelphia 2017 (Best Ensemble Cast in a Web Series)WINNER First Glance Film Festival Philadelphia 2017 (Best Actress in a Web Series - Britni RaineWINNER First Glance Film Festival Philadelphia 2017 (Best Director Web Series - Skyler Barrett)WINNER Female Filmmakers Fuse Film Festival 2017 (Best Web Series)WINNER Female Filmmakers Fuse Film Festival 2017 (Audience Award)WINNER SoCal CIFF 2017 (Best Web Series) | Best Actor Nominee (Alison Kohlhardt)WINNER Los Angeles Film Awards (Best Web Series - Honorable Mention - August 2017)WINNER Best Shorts Competition (Best Web Series - Award of Merit)WINNER Direct Monthly Online Film Festival (Best Web Series - April 2017)WINNER Festigious International Film Competition (Best Web Series)WINNER International Independent Film Awards (Platinum Winner)WINNER WAW Web Series & Short Film Competition (Best Web Series Drama, Best Director in a Web Series Drama, Best Cinematography in a Web Series, Best Supporting Actress in a Web Series Drama - Sadie Eve)OFFICIAL SELECTION Bucharest Shortcut Cinefest 2017OFFICIAL SELECTION Baltimore New Media Web Fest 2017OFFICIAL SELECTION NYC Web Fest 2017OFFICIAL SELECTION First Glance Film Festival Philadelphia 2017 (Best Web Series)OFFICIAL SELECTION Hollywood Comedy Shorts Film Festival 2017OFFICIAL SELECTION Web Series Festival Global 2017OFFICIAL SELECTION Women's Film & Script Showcase 2017OFFICIAL SELECTION Miami Independent Film Festival 2017OFFICIAL SELECTION California Indie Film Festival 2017OFFICIAL SELECTION International Online Web Fest 2016​",53.0,11,"3 Campaigns

Or you can show your #spookcrew support with a Winterbourne button or personalized postcard. 
If you're interested in learning how to make your own videos, consider our intro courses for After Effects, Premiere, Lightroom or Protools. 
If you're in Toronto or willing to travel, we would love to have you come to our launch party and get an exclusive viewing of all ten episodes of Winterbourne! 


We want Winterbourne to serve as an inspiration to women in film. No matter the genre or subject matter, women can make it happen in a male-dominated industry.
Horror films are often subject to several tropes but we want to do more than that. With a diverse cast that's reflective of actual society, we will avoid killing off the expected and give not-so-predictable storylines. 


What if we don't meet our goal? What if something goes wrong?
We have a contingency plan if we are unable to reach our goal or if something goes awry during production. This would include cutting episodes, moving to less ideal locations and reducing actor roles. However, we believe that the budget we set allows for us to produce the highest quality project we are capable of making.


This project is a huge undertaking, and we could not do it without you!  Any contribution you can make, whether it's $1 or $100, will bring us closer to our goal! 
As students ourselves, we understand that not everyone is in the position to be able to contribute. Please consider sharing our campaign, following our social media (Instagram, Twitter and Facebook), and watching our webseries when it's released.",11.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Short of It:</h3>
<p>I'm Lacey the head of Ink Stain Productions and showrunner for Twisted City. You may know me from my previous webseries Maggie Hale's Corner, which was based on the novel North and South. For Twisted City, I'm joined by an amazing team of talented young women around the world who've developed and written the story with me, and we can't wait to bring it to life! </p>
<p>To do that, we need your help. Maggie Hale's Corner was produced with a borrowed camera and basically no budget. For Twisted, we'd like to up the production quality and make the story the best it can be!</p>
<p>Having our own quality camera will make all the difference in the over all product, and anything extra will help us truly make the series come to life. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Long of it: </h3>
<p>We're hoping to raise enough money to invest in a DSLR camera, a simple lighting kit, mics and sound equipment. A bonus would being able to cover the cost of memory cards, better editing software, and an extra hard drive for storage. Our goal covers all that, plus perks and Indiegogo fees. </p>
<p>And speaking of perks, we have some great ones for you including scripts and postcards from both Maggie Hale's Corner and Twisted City, plus the chance to help this series become reality. Be sure to check out all the perks details!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Your Money Goes</h3>
<p>If we don't hit our goal, all the funds left after fulfilling perks and paying fees will still go to equipment and production costs, starting with a camera and working down our list. </p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we can invest in even better equipment and have budget for things like costumes, props, and snacks. Plus we have some fun bonus content stretch goals for you guys:</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$1500- We'll do a bonus crossover with another webseries</li>
<li>$2000-We'll film a bonus episode inspired by another Charles Dickens story</li>
<li>$2500- We'll film some original scenes from the novel </li>

<h3>What It's All About</h3>
<p><strong>Our Story:</strong></p>
<p>In our genderbent update on Oliver Twist, join orphan Olive who leaves behind her horrible job in Mudfog for the urban capital of Washington D.C. Once in D.C. Olive makes both friends and enemies, and ends up entangled in crime, manipulation, and mystery. </p>
<p><strong>Our Vision:</strong></p>
<p>Oliver Twist, while beloved, is a story that undoubtedly was a product of it's time and Dickens' own prejudices. We're endeavoring to counter some of those prejudices, bring not often represented spirituality to the series, and touch on the complicated relationships of friends, lovers, and family. </p>
<p><strong>Our Team:</strong></p>
<p>The creative team behind this show has a varied and unique background. Several of us worked on Maggie Hale's Corner, as well as other projects including Janny's Diary, Charlotte's Web Series, The Femmes Fatale, Any Other Rosie, Pod17, and more. We've been working hard to create this new story. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks:</h3>
<p>As with any film project, there's always a chance things can go wrong: cast or crew might bow out, equipment might break, locations might become unavailable. Any of those things might delay the project for a while. </p>
<h2>How Else to Help:</h2>
<p>Even if you don't have the means to contribute financially, you can still help!</p>
<p>Talk up Twisted City using #TwistedCity, share our campaign on ALL your social media or even in real life, so more people have a chance to be involved in making Twisted City happen! Indiegogo even has some handy buttons over on the side to make it super easy. </p>

<h3>Who We Are...</h3>
<p>Mandated is a web series created and developed by four women. Over three years ago, Jessica Grant, Chelsea Krause, Lauren Lawson, and Kelsey Maples began meeting to discuss creating a series to showcase themselves as actors and to help bring complex women to film. With the help of director and producer Jesse R. Tendler, their incredible crew, a super talented cast, and a collection of generous supporters, the creators have been able to bring this vision to life.</p>
<p>Principal photography for Mandated wrapped last summer. Now the team is in the home stretch of post-production, working to get this project finished and out to an audience. We are currently deep into the process of editing our thirteen-episode season, and hoping to begin our run of the festival circuit this summer.</p>
<p>But before we can release the series, we are in need of help from supporters like you! Only with your assistance can we make sure our project gets finished at a level that makes it worthy of being shared with an audience!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<p>We'll break it down as clearly as possible for you so you can see where it all goes.</p>
<p>We're looking to raise around $11,000. </p>
<ul>
<li>About $5,500 is going to our editor so that he can finish piecing together our shots. He's incredible and is not only doing our video editing but our sound editing as well!</li>
<li>About $500 is going to our incredible colorist who is making our shot coloring and tone both consistent and vivid, helping our cast look better than ever! ;)</li>
<li>Another $2,000 is going towards festival submissions; this allows us to get Mandated out to a wider audience and gives us the opportunity to put it in front of industry folks, sales agents, and distributors!</li>
<li>And the rest? We hope to continue to pitch Mandated to even bigger markets such as Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix to name a few. The rest of the money raised will be to ensure we have our bases covered in order to create packets, marketing materials and other related materials to pitch our series. However, every penny raised goes towards post-production and festivals first!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Rewarding Our Supporters...</h3>
<ul>
<li>We'll do weekly shoutouts on our Facebook page for anyone who makes a contribution of $10 or more!</li>
<li>For $25, you can get an individual shoutout with a silly animal video included.</li>
<li>$50 gets you a first look at our pilot episode BEFORE it is released to the general public.</li>
<li>$100 lands you a 4"" by 6"" art print inspired by the series.</li>
<li>$200 enters you into a raffle for a free dance class in NYC (transportation not provided).</li>
<li>$250 earns you a personalized audio mix.</li>
<li>$300 gets you a Patron of the Arts Credit in our credit reel and on our website.</li>
<li>$500 or more lands you an Associate Producer credit and IMDb entry (that's the Internet Movie Database, where all major studio and network projects are listed)! </li>
<li>and $1500 bumps you up to Executive Producer status!</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out a full list of perks on the right side of the page!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>We, as women, are dedicated to making the world more inclusive for us and others.

<h3>Our Challenges</h3>
<p>We've built this series from the ground up. We were just four girls with a dream, and it was only with the talent, ideas, and support of friends and family that we've been able to make it as far as we have. We won't pretend otherwise!</p>
<p>Creating a series is not only financially taxing, but also something that takes a lot of mental and physical perseverance as well. We worked for months creating, writing, and consulting with others to develop our story. Principal photography involved twelve very long, 14+hr days over the course of three weekends to get everything shot and recorded. And now we are continuously working on editing, scoring, coloring, and finding platforms to showcase our hard work and talent.</p>
<p>It has not been easy. It's been an incredible risk for many of us. We've given up jobs, worked over holidays and breaks, and invested a huge amount of time, effort, and money into the project. We know it's worth it. We hope you'll agree. We're lead by passion and a drive to not simply get things done, but get them done right.</p>

</div><p>...What are you waiting for?? Let's finish this!! :)</p></div>","Who We Are...
Mandated is a web series created and developed by four women. Over three years ago, Jessica Grant, Chelsea Krause, Lauren Lawson, and Kelsey Maples began meeting to discuss creating a series to showcase themselves as actors and to help bring complex women to film. With the help of director and producer Jesse R. Tendler, their incredible crew, a super talented cast, and a collection of generous supporters, the creators have been able to bring this vision to life.
Principal photography for Mandated wrapped last summer. Now the team is in the home stretch of post-production, working to get this project finished and out to an audience. We are currently deep into the process of editing our thirteen-episode season, and hoping to begin our run of the festival circuit this summer.
But before we can release the series, we are in need of help from supporters like you! Only with your assistance can we make sure our project gets finished at a level that makes it worthy of being shared with an audience!
 

What We Need...
We'll break it down as clearly as possible for you so you can see where it all goes.
We're looking to raise around $11,000. 

About $5,500 is going to our editor so that he can finish piecing together our shots. He's incredible and is not only doing our video editing but our sound editing as well!
About $500 is going to our incredible colorist who is making our shot coloring and tone both consistent and vivid, helping our cast look better than ever! ;)
Another $2,000 is going towards festival submissions; this allows us to get Mandated out to a wider audience and gives us the opportunity to put it in front of industry folks, sales agents, and distributors!
And the rest? We hope to continue to pitch Mandated to even bigger markets such as Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix to name a few. The rest of the money raised will be to ensure we have our bases covered in order to create packets, marketing materials and other related materials to pitch our series. However, every penny raised goes towards post-production and festivals first!

 
Rewarding Our Supporters...

We'll do weekly shoutouts on our Facebook page for anyone who makes a contribution of $10 or more!
For $25, you can get an individual shoutout with a silly animal video included.
$50 gets you a first look at our pilot episode BEFORE it is released to the general public.
$100 lands you a 4"" by 6"" art print inspired by the series.
$200 enters you into a raffle for a free dance class in NYC (transportation not provided).
$250 earns you a personalized audio mix.
$300 gets you a Patron of the Arts Credit in our credit reel and on our website.
$500 or more lands you an Associate Producer credit and IMDb entry (that's the Internet Movie Database, where all major studio and network projects are listed)! 
and $1500 bumps you up to Executive Producer status!

Check out a full list of perks on the right side of the page!
 

Our Impact
We, as women, are dedicated to making the world more inclusive for us and others. Our cast and crew are not only diverse but our series also has actors as young as eight to beyond seventy. Our entire AD team, all but one of our production assistants, and many others on both our production and post-production teams are women.
Not to mention our incredibly talented cast! Our actors boast a slew of impressive credits, including television's Orange is the New Black, Billions, Homeland, Assassins, and House of Cards, and Law & Order, as well as Broadway credits from Ruthless to Matilda.

<h3>Blunt Trauma is a joint effort...</h3>
<p>Hello, we're Amanda Chayne Pierson and Alex Dudley! </p>
<p>""Blunt Trauma was loosely inspired by two of my friends and what I hope their adventures would look like if they decided to solve crimes. I sprinkle in my own absurd humor and irrational tendencies. This leads the series down some weird paths like murder and cat paintings, and even more fun like messing around with noir conventions<i>.</i> It’s easy to be distracted by the humor and all the weed, but the heart of the show is about friendship, being at a crossroads in your life and trying to find purpose."" - Amanda ""Murder She Wrote"" Pierson</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Blunts, Traumas, Cats &amp; More!</h3>
<p>We're hoping to raise $3500 for equipment rentals, feeding our cast &amp; crew, emotional support, diamond studded boom mics, and other vital necessities on set. </p>
<p>For our MFA, we will only be producing the first episode of our web series with the hope of continuing on in the future. </p>
<p><strong>Episode 1: Crime &amp; Cannabis</strong>: After smoking a crazy experimental strain of weed, best friends BILLS and KRAMER wake up covered in blood, with no memory of the night before. Suspecting that they may have killed Kramer's ex, NATALIE, they seek help from their finicky dealer, OLD GREG. Though Old Greg illuminates some details from the night before, Bills and Kramer realize that, in order to truly rehash the night and retrace their steps, they'll need to smoke the very strain that got them into this mess. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Equipment upgrades </strong>will allow us to improve our quality. We have just enough camera and audio equipment to pull this off, but we can provide a far more exciting viewing experience with better quality audio from lapel microphones and a sound mixer, interactive maps, streaming equipment, plus we're desperately in need of a few camera lenses to ensure all the footage looks top quality, more tripods, cables, and other dull production bits and bobs to get the ball rolling. <strong>We're estimating the cost of equipment to be around £600, but at £800 we'd have everything we needed for a long term endeavor. </strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Artist compensation </strong>- high quality art of our characters, NPCs, and the world we're playing in will add another dimension to the show with beautiful visuals to accompany what we're doing and saying. Great talent requires good compensation, and this art will become available for backers as part of some of our rewards, then later for viewers. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Terrain, miniatures, maps</strong> - custom made terrain boards and monsters will make for a very exciting show to watch and play, and the more we explore in the vast world of our game, the more we'll need!<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Set design to remember!</strong> With a production set designer on our team of players, we're definitely on track already, but we need materials and props to bring our videos to life. Some of your contributions will be used to make a high production value set that can last the length of the series.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Rewards</strong> - a small amount of the funding will be used to create physical rewards such as art prints, stickers and pins, but we estimate <strong>less than £100 </strong>for this and will keep costs as low as possible. We're offering free shipping on all physical rewards smaller than a large package, too.</li>

<p><u><strong>The Pitch: We’re making a new show for right now.</strong></u></p>
<p>Hello family, friends, and theater fans. We’re a team of four theater artists in Portland, Maine using this pandemic pause to create <strong>a new web series called “Hausfrau.” It’s based on a one-woman comedy about the sublime ridiculousness that is being a stay-at-home parent.</strong> While theaters are closed, we want to stay open to our creativity and new ideas, so, we’re putting our artistic energy and expertise into transforming a hilarious solo show for the stage into a new form made expressly for your enjoyment online. Embracing the <strong>DIY scrappy-style of an early 2000s mommy vlog, this newest version of the Hausfrau, sharing her misadventure mama stories and hand-drawn cartoons, will keep you laughing this fall.</strong> And with your generous-at-any-level contributions, we will complete a <strong>6-episode season that everyone - hausfraus, hausdaddies, anyone who helps raise kids, or anyone who has ever met a kid - will be able to enjoy for free on YouTube.</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Meet the Team</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Bess Welden - actor/writer.</strong> Bess makes theater as a performer, playwright, producer, and educator. She’s written/co-written twenty original performance works including plays, librettos, and podcast/audio scripts with a long-time focus on solo shows.<a href=""https://www.besswelden.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> https://www.besswelden.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Hannah Cordes - director. </strong>Hannah is a director, educator, actor, and the Education Director at Portland Stage. Hannah facilitates workshops throughout New England, working with students, teachers, and artists to use theatre as a tool for self-discovery; literacy; community-building and collaboration; exploration of difficult or controversial topics; and creative expression. As the daughter of a single mother, Hannah was immediately pumped to help bring Hausfrau’s stories to life and delighted by the humor and honesty of this project. <a href=""http://hannahcordes.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://hannahcordes.weebly.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Todd Brian Backus - script consultant/video editor.</strong> Todd is the Literary Manager at Portland Stage Company in Maine. He’s also a new works dramaturg, and, perhaps most importantly, very online. He’s a co-producer with Dungeons + Drama Nerds (<a href=""https://www.dungeonsanddramanerds.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dungeonsanddramanerds.com</a>), a podcast about tabletop role-playing games and theatre, and can be found just about everywhere on the internet @tbbackus. You can also check out his work at <a href=""https://www.toddbrianbackus.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">toddbrianbackus.com</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Leo Hilton - director of photography/all around tech guy. </strong>Leo is a theatrical electrician and lighting technician, most recently at Asolo Repertory Theater in Sarasota, FL. He’s also a lighting designer and amateur photographer. </p>
<p>With cartoon contributions from the original Hausfrau herself, Nicole Chaison (<a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/25802/the-passion-of-the-hausfrau-by-nicole-chaison/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/25802/the-passion-of-the-hausfrau-by-nicole-chaison/</a>)</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>When Portland Stage initially shut down public performances last spring, they had Todd reach out to a number of Affiliate Artists to see what sort of nimble, digital projects could be made. After some brainstorming between Todd and Bess it seemed clear just filming <i>The Passion of the Hausfrau</i> wouldn’t cut it, and instead we adapted the monologue play into the modern monologue, the vlog! Through a grant earlier this summer, Portland Stage gave us some seed money to dream up the series and begin creating a pilot. Thank you Portland Stage! (<a href=""https://www.portlandstage.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.portlandstage.org/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Now, our goal is to raise $3300 to fully fund a 6-episode season.</strong> We’ve determined it takes $500 to create each episode and compensate all artists involved. We also need an additional $300 to pay modest royalties to the original play production team, including Annette Jolles (co-writer/director), Nicole Chaison (co-writer/illustrator), and Hans Indigo Spencer (original music/sound design), whose creative fingerprints are showing up all over this new version of the material.</p>
<p>We also want to offer<strong> a stretch-goal: with each additional $500 over target we raise, we’ll be able to create a bonus episode</strong>. If we raise enough above-and-beyond, we might even consider creating a full second season in spring 2021. There are so many Hausfrau stories to tell.</p>
<p><strong>But we need your support to make it happen</strong>. When you contribute at any level, you’ll know you’re:</p>
<ul>
<li>supporting theater artists creatively and financially at a time when our industry has essentially shut down</li>
<li>helping make the web series available at no cost to everyone and anyone in the whole wide world</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out our contribution levels and perks and choose what fits best for you. We’re genuinely thrilled to have your support and excited to let the world know that you’ve helped bring this unique project to fruition.</p>
<p><strong>We believe we all need art in our lives. We believe we all could use a good laugh right now, too. We believe “Hausfrau” as a web series will help us have both.</strong> We’re excited and confident that our collective 50+ years of theater-making experience will <strong>bring the Hausfrau to new life in a binge-watch worthy way.</strong> Two of our creative team members Bess (Big Mouth Thunder Thighs, Madeleines, Legbala is a River) and Todd (PowerOut NYC) both have established records of successfully crowdfunding to produce new work. With your financial support and trust, we’ve totally got this.</p>
<p>If for any reason we don’t make our $3300 goal, we will use your contributions to create as many episodes as we can. So no matter what, you’ll get some Hausfrau humor and heart one way or another this fall.</p>
<p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>If you’re simply not in a position to contribute monetarily, we completely understand. We know so many people are struggling in so many ways right now. But! There are other ways to support us for free. <strong>Sharing our campaign on your social media feeds and talking it up with your friends and family helps us out a lot.</strong> And once the season launches, we hope you’ll be among our regular viewers. If you love what we’ve made, we hope you’ll invite everyone you know to enjoy it, too.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>In The Other Belles, we delve into the lives of four young women pursuing careers in fields traditionally dominated by men. The Other Belles will challenge cultural norms through the lens of an ensemble sitcom. Funny and meaningful, this binge-worthy series will invest viewers with relatable characters and relevant storylines.  We are currently working toward a goal of securing quality, local talent with name recognition in order to attract networks to this worthy project. Our previous pilot, ""The Hutchins"" starred veteran actor Michael H. Cole, building and strengthening our resumé, and demonstrating our commitment to excellent talent on each and every project.</p>
<p>This series is going to be, at once, revolutionary and familiar — new ideas and strong characters in a recognizable, universal sitcom format. Think “The Big Bang Theory” meets “Family Matters.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of people striving to bring great film opportunity to all. We know all too well that show business is a challenging field, but we endeavor to always pursue our dreams and work toward making them a reality.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Producer: Sam Wilson</strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
In The Other Belles, we delve into the lives of four young women pursuing careers in fields traditionally dominated by men. The Other Belles will challenge cultural norms through the lens of an ensemble sitcom. Funny and meaningful, this binge-worthy series will invest viewers with relatable characters and relevant storylines.  We are currently working toward a goal of securing quality, local talent with name recognition in order to attract networks to this worthy project. Our previous pilot, ""The Hutchins"" starred veteran actor Michael H. Cole, building and strengthening our resumé, and demonstrating our commitment to excellent talent on each and every project.
This series is going to be, at once, revolutionary and familiar — new ideas and strong characters in a recognizable, universal sitcom format. Think “The Big Bang Theory” meets “Family Matters.”

<p>Teagan (Tierney Malloy)</p>
<p>Known for being optimistic, fun and curious! Teagan is always open to finding new opportunities and experiencing new things, which subsequently led the girls to their new workplace.

<p>Violetta (Arielle Diaz)</p>
<p>Although she can be perceived as serious and hard, Violetta is the life of the party! After years of an in-depth, heartbreaking relationship, she became bulletproof – at the expense of her chance at love. Violetta moved to LA to start over, and to give herself a fresh chance at life and love.  Inside she’s just a hopeless romantic who wants a man who will treat her right. Simple enough, right?

<p>The only thing that separates talent from talent is opportunity.  We have decided to move forward from hopes and dreams to pursue reality!

Our hopes, successes, our failures, the men… it’s all (kind of) real! We’ll let you decide which parts are the truth :) Our goal is to shine positive light on the push and pull between females and males, and to specifically empower the image of independent women who are still people, facing challenges and real life experiences.</p>

On behalf of the company we hope you can make a contribution to make our vision come to life. We'd like to make it a series thats memorable through the funny moments and the not so funny moments. 
Who doesn't love funny, unique, and compelling characters whom all come together for a round of golf!?
The 9 episodic web series will explore the comedic side of golf and modern day relationships. Each episode will run between 5-9 minutes. We want to make this funny and unique web series as professional as we can! So please help us reach our goal!
THE STORY
This story is centered around a not so lucky guy named TOM. Tom to say the least is a loser. The one thing he can't live without is his spicy girlfriend Talia, whom is on the verge of breaking up with him. In order to take his girlfriends heart back is to win a golf game(Tom hasn't played golf in a long time).
