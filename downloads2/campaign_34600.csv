</h3>
<p>The wave of Syrian refugees currently washing over Europe is real. Wendela and I are experiencing it personally in our new home in France.  <br/></p>
<p>We have, in the past few weeks been part of the founding of a network of concerned French and foreign individuals who are devoted to doing what we can to ease the situation of refugees arriving here after months (and for some, years) of a very tough existence.  <br/></p>
<p>The group we are currently helping includes about 40 people, including 14 children,  They were forced from their homes in Syria and made their way here via Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Morocco and Spain. Their resources are exhausted and so are they. They are squatting now in condemned apartments in a town nearby.<br/></p>
<p>Our group, <a href=""http://languedocsolidarite.com/home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Languedoc Solidarity with Refugees/Solidarité avec les réfugiés</a>,<b> </b>is helping them to survive while their applications for political asylum are considered by the French government. Once their applications are accepted (usually a matter of weeks) they will be eligible for some minimal assistance from the government but, in the meantime, they are on their own. Organizing ourselves very quickly, we have been able to provide them with basic food supplies, warm clothes and bedding, emergency medical care and logistical support in dealing with the local bureaucracy.</p>
<p>We have raised approximately $6,000 (Euros 5,400) in the past five weeks in a combination of material and financial contributions. The number of refugees assisted goes up and down as some successfully transition into the French system and new ones arrive. The truth is that we don't know what it will all look like next week but, over the next several months we are expecting the need to increase overall. The funds raised by this appeal will help us maintain the current level of support for another six weeks.</p>
<p>I (Gary) am the treasurer of this group.  All contributions to this campaign will come to me directly and I will personally turn them over to the group as expenses are incurred. I can personally assure all donors that every penny and centime will be used to help these people who need it so badly.  Those of you who know us, know how seriously we take this responsibility and how committed we are to helping these families. And, in our interaction with them over the past weeks, we are reminded again that they are not statistics, a political issue, or a faceless mass.  They are fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, children and babies with problems that the rest of us can hardly conceive of. They are not coming here out of choice but out of fear and concern for their children.They would much prefer to be living their lives in peace in their own homes.</p>
<p>Please dig in a little bit to help us help them.  <br/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Modern High School was started by Janab Khader Ali Khan , a social worker in 1958 with a strength of 200 students.over the years the strength increased and reached about 1400 in 1971 with a teaching staff of about 40.</span></p>
<p>But due to the lack of funds over the years,the student strength has been decreasing and reached about 350 in 2015.</p>

</div></div>","What is Modern High School?
  Modern
high school is a government aided institution established in 1958 in Hyderabad,India.It
was started to encourage education for the underprivileged children from
 the nearby surrounding urban slums of old Hyderabad.
Modern High School was started by Janab Khader Ali Khan , a social worker in 1958 with a strength of 200 students.over the years the strength increased and reached about 1400 in 1971 with a teaching staff of about 40.
But due to the lack of funds over the years,the student strength has been decreasing and reached about 350 in 2015.



What Modern High School Needs
·  Education
 here is still limited to the conventional method of blackboard and
books.This project is required to raise funds to help the school build better
classrooms,a science laboratory,a library and such.Doing
so is expected to help the students gain knowledge from a practical perspective
and help improve the academic standards of the school and also attract more students to take admission.
The present school funds are insufficient to support the staff salaries  and thus have limited the school to 20 teachers.
- We don't receive any aid to support MHS's infrastructure- We don't receive any financial grants




Our Stretch Goal:
Here is our dream. $25,000! We are planning to build a computer and science lab and buy at least 50 desks for students.




Did you know?
1. Modern high school was started in 1958 
2. Student to teacher ratio then was 25:2 (that is every
teacher could attend up to 13 children)
3.In 2015 the student to teacher ratio has decreased to 40:1
4. Modern high school has attained recognition from the
government of telangana,India 
5.The fees collected from each student is $4 per month
6.The school also provides free mid day meals to the students sponsored by the government of India
7. Students of this schools come from households whose
median income range from$25-$50 per month
8. A student from Modern High School,Sheeba Fatima has won the National Main cum Merit Scholarship by competing against  students from all the schools in this area,thus receiving sponsorship for her education from the Government of India for the next 5 years.
9.Each dollar invested in education gives returns of $7-$13


Where will your scholarship contribution go?
We are directly working with management and headmistress of MHS, we have a initial goal of $25000.Any contribution made through indiegogo will directly reach the students of Modern High School.

</div></div>","Give the gift of literacy, self-expression and empowerment!Our Story & The Impact

Notebooks for Peace provides inspirational, customized composition books (""Notebooks for Peace"") to youth, aged 15 - 25, in conflict zones by way of youth empowerment-focused NGOs. We work with NGOs to ensure the notebooks reach the desired audience. First stop: The West Bank & Gaza. Why is our project important? Each notebook is a gift for a young person in a conflict zone because sometimes they need more than aid - they need inspiration. 

Inspired by the Arab Spring, the notebooks allow youth in unstable environments to express themselves and collaborate; they are tools to help youth organize and mobilize. Notebooks for Peace are an outlet for artistic expression and a tool in the struggle for social change and justice. They empower youth and encourage literacy, self-expression and freedom.

The Need


""At the present time, the West Bank (covering an area of 6,257 Km 2 ) and the Gaza Strip (378 Km 2 ) have an estimated population of 3.15 million Palestinians. About one-third of the population are stu-dents at all levels of education. All through their modern history, Palestinians have always valued education highly.""- United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization

""Educational development in Palestine is a unique, rich and challenging experience. Unique because it is one of the very few places in the world, if not the only one, where a Ministry of Education is being built from scratch. Rich because of the eagerness and motivation of the Palestinians to learn from others. Challenging because Palestine is not yet an independent country and is witnessing conflict on a daily basis...However, there is a risk that the conflict will also lead to the complete destruction of educational development work in Palestine so far, as well as the loss of prospects of peace in the country and in the region."" - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization

""Of the approximately seven million Palestinian refugees around the world, more than 650,000 are living in camps along the West Bank and Gaza Strip."" - Rich Wiles, Author and Photographic Artist

""An estimated 280 of the 641 schools in Gaza were damaged and 18 were destroyed. More than half of Gazaâ€™s population is under the age of 18 and the disruption to their education, due to the damage caused during Operation â€œCast Leadâ€ (from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009) and as a result of the continuing Israeli boycott, is having a devastating impact."" - Amnesty International Researcher
View Amnesty International video on the situation in Gaza and the West Bank

The DesignThe notebooks use love for art, poetry and international development in way that is truly inspiring. The front cover is a positive social change painting by Kenneth Cruz (he has donated two paintings to this project) and the inside cover includes an inspirational poem by myself, Uraidah Hassani. The top of the page reads: ""This is a NOTEBOOK FOR PEACE. This notebook is yours.""
Here is a sample of a ""Notebook for Peace"":
How it Works & What We Need
We will be sending the first shipment of Notebooks for Peace to AMIDEAST's office in the West Bank. AMIDEAST is a leading American non-profit organization engaged in international education, training and development activities in the Middle East and North Africa. Each shipment of notebooks costs between $1,000 - $1,500, taking into account number of books requested and location of NGO, and the notebooks will be manufactured in the United States.
We want to fundraise the entire project through contributions by the global community because we value the message community involvement brings to social change projects. The success of this project depends on people like you! Each pledge of $1 or more receives rewards (see right)! 

How Your Contribution Will Help

Your money will go towards:



Funding the production of 100+ Notebooks for Peace


Funding the shipping of the books to the West Bank


(If we exceed our goal) Funding future Notebooks for Peace projects

 



For your donation, you receive:


our eternal gratitude;

the lasting knowledge that you gave young people a personalized writing source to encourage their literacy, self-expression and artistic abilities, and encourage their freedom; 

a truly inspiring gift that will empower youth who have indomitable will to live and ""be the change""; 

your name on the Donor Wall of our blog;

a reward equivalent to the size of the donation you gave;

and some truly awesome karma headed your way!

Note: This is an on-going project that will continue to ship personalized notebooks to youth in conflict zones on a global scale. Therefore, if we fail to meet our funding goals by the end of the year, your donations are still directed towards this project... because Notebooks for Peace is not a one-time project!

 

Other Ways You Can Help
While due to the nature of our project, we are most in need of financial donations, we are delighted when our supporters contribute to our efforts by sharing our project with your friends, family and various other networks.

 
Please share this project with your network of friends... tweet, post on Facebook, email, embed, what have you! Your clicks & shares increase our ""GoGo Factor"" on the site and our chances of being featured. So by all means, go ahead! Your clicking & sharing is very valuable to us!

<p>We have started a school and need to raise $4,000 to guarantee teacher benefits for the 2013/2014 school year.</p>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>We are an affordable, high-quality school for kindergarten through 8th grade located in San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of school?</strong></p>
<p>1. We are progressive.</p>
<p>From our curriculum to our affordable tuition – we fully embrace what it means to be a progressive school.</p>
<p>What is progressive curriculum?</p>
<p>Project-based. Individualized to each child. Hands-on learning. Experiential. </p>
<p>2. We are affordable.</p>
<p>This means more families have access to high-quality education and this is what our country needs, now. The Schoolhouse has built a solution and will grow as long as we have support.</p>
<p>3. We are a community.</p>
<p>Families make a good school great. Our administration is made up of dedicated parent volunteers. We are proving that a community can build a school from the ground up.</p>
<p><strong>Why this project?</strong></p>
<p>To secure high-quality teachers we need to be able to guarantee teacher benefits. </p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p>The education crisis in this country demands we do whatever it takes, and we must implement a variety of new models both inside and outside the current system.</p>
<p>Impact: Take this model and replicate it throughout California to provide high-quality, affordable education to as many families as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Why us?</strong> We are proving that an affordable, parent-participation model works – we went from 2 children to 19 children in one year.</p>
<p>We built it, now we need to guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>How can I connect and find out more about the school?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How can people help?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DONATE. SHARE.<br/></strong></p>
<p>We ask you to make a contribution, no matter how small.  By doing so, you will insure that affordable, high-quality education is an option for more San Francisco families.</p>
<p>You can share this campaign with your collegues, friends, family or anyone who may share in a similar passion (or might like to help).</p>
<p>Our tuition covers what it takes to educate a child – the teacher, a room and basic supplies.</p>
<p>We are fundraising to <strong>guarantee teacher benefits</strong> for the upcoming 2013/2014 school year. These additional funds are needed to insure the <strong>affordability</strong> and the future growth of the school.</p>
<p>As the Holidays are approaching, DONATING is a great gift in the season of Giving. What better than a gift to our children.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you.</p>

The education crisis in this country demands we do whatever it takes, and we must implement a variety of new models both inside and outside the current system.
Impact: Take this model and replicate it throughout California to provide high-quality, affordable education to as many families as possible.
Why us? We are proving that an affordable, parent-participation model works – we went from 2 children to 19 children in one year.
We built it, now we need to guarantee it.
How can I connect and find out more about the school?

How can people help?
DONATE. SHARE.
We ask you to make a contribution, no matter how small.  By doing so, you will insure that affordable, high-quality education is an option for more San Francisco families.
You can share this campaign with your collegues, friends, family or anyone who may share in a similar passion (or might like to help).
Our tuition covers what it takes to educate a child – the teacher, a room and basic supplies.
We are fundraising to guarantee teacher benefits for the upcoming 2013/2014 school year. These additional funds are needed to insure the affordability and the future growth of the school.
As the Holidays are approaching, DONATING is a great gift in the season of Giving. What better than a gift to our children.
Thank you, thank you.

You see, I’m graduating from San Diego State University in less than a month (woohoo!). I am the first to graduate from college in any of my extended family. I’ve worked my butt off to graduate in four years, as that’s exactly how long I was eligible to receive my full-ride scholarship (which without, I wouldn’t have even been able to go to anything other than a community college). Over the course of these last four years, I’ve had two jobs (working well over 40 hours a week between them) as well as taking 15 to sometimes even 20 units a semester. These jobs helped pay for my wedding to my wonderful husband, as well as paying rent and other bills, and paying off his student loans, which after several years are now down to $30,000. Between my husband’s two jobs and mine we were doing okay, but some poor decisions were made and now he’s making far less than before. We were forced to move into my parent’s house because we had no place to live and couldn’t feed ourselves (all my money was going to our car payment, insurance, phone bills, and paying off student loans).</p>
<p>We are still in this situation today. However, there is hope on the horizon! I have been hired by COKO JUKU, an English school in Japan! I’m getting all emotional as I’m typing this, because this has literally been my life dream. As a child, I always knew I would one day become a teacher. When I took a Japanese course on a whim at SDSU I absolutely fell in love, changed my major to Japanese (I was originally going for Biology) and decided that I would teach in Japan. It’s hard to believe that already paperwork is making its way through Japan so I can fulfill my dream of teaching there.</p>
<p>Everything is set, except for one more obstacle in my way: money. I have recently found out that it is VERY expensive to move to Japan, and right now my husband and I are barely clinging on. As a condition of my employment I have to get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language, or TEFL, Certificate, which already costs way too much ($2750). Then, I have buy plane tickets for my husband and me (at least $1200). Thirdly, I need money for a deposit for my apartment as well as two month’s rent (at least $2500). Finally, as I won’t be getting my first paycheck until about a month and a half after I get there, I need money just to eat ($???)!</p>
<p>            You may ask, with all these expenses, is it even worth it?</p>
<p>100% YES! </p>
<p>Despite the heavy expense at the beginning, I will be making more by myself (with one job) than my husband and I have ever made together (both working two or three jobs). If my husband can manage to find work out there, then even better! For the first time in what feels like forever, we’ll be able to completely support ourselves. Do you know how great that will feel? AMAZING! Since we’ve been married (and all the time we were together before) we’ve never been able to just live by ourselves as a couple. We’ve always had at least four other roommates, that is, until we had to move back in with my parents. We long to know what it’s like to be a real married couple, just living by ourselves and setting our own rules. In addition, we’ll finally be able to start saving for a house of our own so we don’t have to keep throwing our money into the life-sucking pit of renting. And I mustn’t forget to mention that IT’S MY DREAM FINALLY COMING TRUE AHHHH I CAN’T BELIEVE IT!!!           </p>
<p>One last reason (and honestly, more important to me than my dream) is that my husband and I want to start a family. We’ve been desperately wanting a baby since the day we got married. We are both HUGE family people and we absolutely cannot wait to get started. However, as you can probably tell, we’ve never really been in the situation to have a baby. A house or apartment with four other college-aged people is no place for a baby, and now that we can’t even pay for our own food, now is definitely not the time. Moving to Japan for work will give us the financial stability we’ve been searching for to finally start planning on having a family.</p>
<p>If I don’t get all the money I need, it will first go to getting my TEFL Certificate, as that is an important step if I want to teach at all in the first place. My next step will be to hopefully qualify to take about some loans. I would very much hate to do that, as we’re always paying WAY too much a month to pay back my husband’s student loans, but if that’s the only way to get the money then that’s what I’ll have to do.</p>
<p>Now, how does helping me help society? If I go to Japan to teach, I’ll be a sort of American ambassador to those I’m teaching. I’ll be able to teach those of Japan more about American culture while at the same time portraying a positive example of Americans. In addition, I will be learning more about Japan and their culture. Simple things like the cultural exchanges I’ll be participating in are important steps in creating a global harmony where people of all different backgrounds can understand each other and work together.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the means to help out financially, don’t fret! You can do wonders just by getting the word out! If you like my campaign and want to help by spreading the word, please do so! Post my link in your Facebook, twitter or blog, send some emails, whatever!

<h2>Why Suits for Scholars?</h2>
<p>When I started my senior year at William and Mary, I remember very clearly my mother taking me shopping for an interview suit.  We went to the Anne Klein outlet in Williamsburg, where she bought me a beautiful burgundy wool skirt suit and a coordinating ivory silk shawl collared blouse.  It was the fall of 1995, and I looked very professional in it - it was a far cry from my typical jeans and plaid flannel shirts.  Every time I put on that suit, I felt confident that I was putting my best foot forward.</p>
<p>My senior year, I also worked in the Office of Career Services, and I witnessed many students' reactions to finding out they had been selected for interviews.</p>
<p><em>Yes, young alumni, after we parked our dinosaurs outside, we would wait in the hallway of Blow Hall to read a paper list tacked up on a strip of corkboard to see who made the cut.</em></p>
<p>Each person selected was excited.  But while many took off to start preparing, several would slink inside the office to ask some version of:</p>
<p>""Is it okay if I just wear a nice shirt and pants? I don't own a suit.""</p>
<p>One of us working would smile sympathectically and say, ""Why don't you try to borrow something.  Maybe from a roommate, or a friend?""  The student would then spend the next few days frantically trying to borrow appropriate clothes in the correct size.  Some were more successful than others.</p>
<p>Ashleigh Brock, Assistant Director at the now-named Cohen Career Center, has a different vision for these students.  When they walk in to the office and say ""I have an interview, but... I don't own a suit"", her response can be ""Why don't you borrow something from us.  Let's go to the closet and see what suits we have in your size."" </p>
<p>I would have loved to have been able to offer that help to students back in 1995.  This is my - and your - opportunity to provide that help to our current students. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What They Need</h2>
<p>Ashleigh Brock has worked hard collecting donated items for Suits for Scholars.  She has suits for men and women in a variety of sizes, some shirts, some shoes.  But she doesn't have items in every size.  The goal is to help every student who walks through the door needing help, not just the ones who are a size X.</p>
<p>By raising funds through indiegogo.com, we can give her the flexibility to shop for the most needed items. Currently, this means women's suits in specific sizes and men's pants in specific sizes.  She also needs a few blazers.  If there is a small remainder after buying the big ticket items, she will use the money for dress shoes, belts, and other accessories as needed.  In other words, if she is able to buy three suits, and there is $30 left over, she will put the money to good use by purchasing a smaller, but still needed, item.</p>
<p>Your cash donation of $10, $25, $50 or more will help her fill these needs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>William and Mary students work HARD.  They are well-qualified to add value to employers and be productive citizens.  They are READY. </p>
<p>The socioeconomic status of their parents should have no bearing on the initial impression they make on interviewers.  None.  Yet the reality is, not every student is equally set up for success regarding interview attire.  And research shows that interviewers form their opinions of candidates within the first 10 seconds of meeting.  For better or for worse, the interview outfit has a large impact on the outcome of the interview.</p>
<p>You have the ability, with your contribution, to help William and Mary students get their first jobs. Let them stand on your shoulders for a day while they make their case to employers. Let them send the message ""Hire me"" with their appearance. </p>
<p>Please make your donation now.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Share, share, share!  Please e-mail, tweet, post to Facebook!  Many small donations can add up to a big impact, so please help spread the word.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>If you were like me, and had a family member help you get your first suit, this is an opportunity to pay it forward.</p>
<p>If you could have used this kind of help as a student, please help make the interview process a little easier for the next crop of students.  As you know, the interview process is stressful enough.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>On February, 15<sup>th</sup> 2013, I plan to begin my lifelong dream of traveling the world.  My first trip out of the country will involve teaching English in Nepal for five months with the IVHQ Volunteer Program.  For more information on International Volunteer HQ, you are welcome to visit: <a href=""http://www.volunteerhq.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.volunteerhq.org/</a></p>
<p>Travelling the world has been a lifelong dream of mine that has always appeared intangible due to limited funds and limited thinking.  I was born and raised in Newark, NJ and once I left NJ for college, I vowed to myself that I would never return.   Well, sometimes, with the Most High Creator, we never know where the Creator will place us.  For the past two years, the Most High Creator has placed me in Newark, NJ.</p>
<p>Living within Newark, NJ for the past two years has been interesting.  When I left N.J. for college, I always carried a strange tinge of guilt for leaving.  I often posed the question to myself, “Why do I get to leave? What makes me so special?”  I guess these two questions constantly streaming through my thoughts led me back to Newark, NJ.  My return to Newark, NJ has allowed me to find answers to my questions:  Why wouldn’t I want to leave?  Life is not to be struggled through.  Life is for living.  I am special and I deserve to get out just like everyone else who has a desire to get out.  There’s nothing wrong with staying, yet, there’s nothing wrong with leaving either.</p>
<p>While in Nepal, I hope to gain a new perspective on life.  I desire to show myself that I am not a victim of my circumstances.  I hope to discover Ashley.  I hope to find answers as to why my mother planted me here.  I hope to write some super dope writings that will inspire many.  I hope to inspire the little black girl that sits on the stoop across from my house, I want to show her that there’s a way out if she desires to get out and it’s okay if she wants to see all of the pictures that this world is capable of creating.  I hope to encourage others within my community to leave their comfort zone and experience life in a way that they desire.   I just wanna live…My intuition has provided me with the green light, so now it’s time to run and never look back.</p>
<p>So, I’m finally allowing myself to think big and to travel the world.  If you would like to support my endeavor to live life by traveling the world, financial donations, prayers and well-wishes are greatly appreciated.   Financial donations will cover program cost and roundtrip flight fair. Please contact me via phone or email if you have any questions.</p>

<h3>Our School</h3>
<p>Pioneers Baccalaureate School is located in the West Bank city of Nablus (visit us at: <a href=""www.pioneers.ps"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pioneers.ps</a>). Started at the close of the Second Intifada, our school seeks to build a generation of learners equipped to help move Palestine forward. We do this by offering a very unique bilingual education that focuses heavily on developing critical thinking and communication skills as well as regular academics.</p>
<p>Our school started with 1st-3rd grade and has grown by one grade-level every year. This year, we have begun our first year of 9th grade and our SAT high school program.  We will be proud to graduate our first high school class in 2016. </p>
<p>We are also proud to bring in a fully native-speaking English staff every year. This drastically improves our students' language, but it also broadens their world view in a very positive way. Our teachers are capable, educated, and dedicated young men and women who devote extreme amounts of time and energy to these students.</p>
<p>Though we are a private school, we are also a non-profit organization. Student tuition covers the basic operating costs of our organization, and we are also proud to offer many scholarships to students from the surrounding refugee camps. </p>
<p>As we develop, we face myriad challenges due to location and funding. Getting high-level English materials to the West Bank is not easy. Our students begin reading chapter books around 3rd or 4th grade, and we've recycled the few books we have for the past few years. Now, our older students are at a whole new level. They are voracious readers, and their appetite for literature will only get stronger in the coming years. Therefore, it is high time that we provide them the books that they deserve!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>Nablus is a large, but extremely isolated city. Access to middle and high school level English literature is limited. For many of our students, making the trip to a library in Ramallah is simply not an option. Therefore, our school is the only place these students can obtain books in English. We feel that it is our duty to make more books available. </p>
<p>Our project goal of $5,000 will cover the cost of classroom sets of 27 novels for our school.

Pioneers Baccalaureate School is located in the West Bank city of Nablus (visit us at: www.pioneers.ps). Started at the close of the Second Intifada, our school seeks to build a generation of learners equipped to help move Palestine forward. We do this by offering a very unique bilingual education that focuses heavily on developing critical thinking and communication skills as well as regular academics.
Our school started with 1st-3rd grade and has grown by one grade-level every year. This year, we have begun our first year of 9th grade and our SAT high school program.  We will be proud to graduate our first high school class in 2016. 
We are also proud to bring in a fully native-speaking English staff every year. This drastically improves our students' language, but it also broadens their world view in a very positive way. Our teachers are capable, educated, and dedicated young men and women who devote extreme amounts of time and energy to these students.
Though we are a private school, we are also a non-profit organization. Student tuition covers the basic operating costs of our organization, and we are also proud to offer many scholarships to students from the surrounding refugee camps. 
As we develop, we face myriad challenges due to location and funding. Getting high-level English materials to the West Bank is not easy. Our students begin reading chapter books around 3rd or 4th grade, and we've recycled the few books we have for the past few years. Now, our older students are at a whole new level. They are voracious readers, and their appetite for literature will only get stronger in the coming years. Therefore, it is high time that we provide them the books that they deserve!


Our Project
Nablus is a large, but extremely isolated city. Access to middle and high school level English literature is limited. For many of our students, making the trip to a library in Ramallah is simply not an option. Therefore, our school is the only place these students can obtain books in English. We feel that it is our duty to make more books available. 
Our project goal of $5,000 will cover the cost of classroom sets of 27 novels for our school. This covers many of the books that our students will use in middle school, as well as those that they will need for the next four years of high school. These books will be integrated into our curriculum and will help us achieve our standards for literature and language arts.  The list of books includes (but is not limited to): 
The Westing Game, Tangerine, Maniac Magee, Ender's Game, Harriet the Spy, Matilda, Because of Winn-Dixie, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Animal Farm, Fahrenheit 451, The Old Man and the Sea, Hamlet, Grapes of Wrath, and Heart of Darkness. 


Obviously these books alone will not achieve the requirements of our program, but it is a wonderful start!
We will be purchasing the books in bulk from The Reading Warehouse, and shipping them (for free!) to a U.S. location. We will then ship them to the West Bank (via Israel). The customs fees and taxes, as well as the shipping costs, are calculated into our goal. 
In the event that we do not reach our goal we will purchase as many classroom sets as funding allows, focusing on our immediate needs for the rest of this year. Any amount that you can contribute will go towards getting us these books, and we thank you in advance for your help!

<h3><strong>OUR GOAL:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><strong>Our overall goal is to raise $50,000 to send 25 poor children to high school in Jamaica for 2013-2014 school year.  </strong></strong>This Indiegogo Campaign is part of the overall fundraising effort.  Every dollar counts!  A $5 gift provides lunch for one child for one day.  A $20,000 gift funds 13 students!</p>
<h3><strong>WHO WE ARE:</strong></h3>
<p>CARIBBEAN EDUCATION FOUNDATION, INC. (CEF) is a registered 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, nonprofit organization based in the United States.  We are dedicated to helping poor children receive meaningful access to quality education.  Our current mission country is Jamaica. </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Public High Schools are NOT FREE in Jamaica!  </strong>High school starts in Grade 7. It costs at least $1,500 U.S. to send 1 child to public high school each year.  Children must pay school fees, textbooks, transportation and lunch, including the usual uniforms and school supplies!  The minimum wage is $50 U.S. per week for a 40 hour work week or $200 U.S. dollars per month. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, it is practically impossible for working poor families to regularly send their children to high school.  The dismal situation is depriving an entire generation of brilliant children of meaningful access to education.</p>
<p><em><strong>HIGH SCHOOL - A CRITICAL PROBLEM</strong></em> (Jamaica Education Report by the Ministry of Education)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Over 30% of urban youth and 50% of rural youth have little to no High School attendance</strong>.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Low attendance rates are due to a lack of bus fare to attend school.</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</li>
<li>50% of students are below their grade level. </li>
<li>By Grade 9, hundreds of thousands of students, especially boys, cannot read or write.</li>
<li>Chronic poor attendance at all levels is the major cause of the high illiteracy rate, as well as a lack of text books to learn lessons taught.</li>
<li>
<strong>80% of secondary graduates did not have the requisite qualification for meaningful employment or university programmes.</strong><em><br/></em>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>WHAT HAVE WE DONE?</h3>
<p>Since its inception in April 2007, CEF has awarded over 40 student scholarships in excess of $50,000 U.S. dollars to brilliant, poor children to attend school.  Our Paul Bogle Scholarships students' pay school fees, textbooks, school supplies, transportation and lunch.  Scholarships are based on academic merit and financial need.  Scholarships are renewed each year, if the student attends school regularly and maintains good grades.</p>
<p>Our goal is to help 25 children go back to school in September 2013!  CEF currenlty has 18 children who need scholarship renewals, so they may return to high school in September 2013 and enter Grades 8, 9, and 10.  We have 7 new students who need to enter Grade 7.  </p>

</div><h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b>GLOW Mongolia</b></h1>
<p>While
women are starting to play a larger role in Mongolian society, it is important
that more women from the countryside gain confidence at a young age. It is more
difficult to overcome certain expectations for women outside of UB (the capital).
I want to teach my students that they can have a career. Confident young women
are capable of anything! They need support from teachers like me to gain the
strength they will need to overcome many obstacles in their future.</p>
<p><b> 
Our vision</b> is to see stronger confidence
in young women in Mongolia, which will lead to greater gender equality and a
stronger society in general.</p>
<p><b> 
Goals:</b>  While the United Nations has
declared gender equality a human right, the world still faces a persistent
gender gap. Global trends show that women typically have fewer opportunities
for economic participation, less access to education, greater health risks, and
less political representation. As such, our goal is women's empowerment,
defined by US Peace Corps as, ""increasing a woman's access to
opportunities, control over her own life, and ability to effect change.""
Starting with trainings at a young age is essential to attain such gender
equality. Our program will focus exclusively on female youth in grades nine
through twelve.</p>
<p><b> 
Objective:</b>  After completing one year of
GLOW Club (Girls Leading Our World), our Mongolian students will have gained
confidence and developed skills important for their future lives. Our Mongolian
students will demonstrate their new skills and abilities by teaching at a
cross-cultural two week summer camp with 10-20 American high school
students. </p><p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p><b>The
Basics: </b>We need $320 per Mongolian
student for this project. We would like to include 25 Mongolian high school
girls, which means we need a minimum of $8,000. </p>
<p><b>The
Project includes </b>a Speaker
Series, Health and Life Skills classes, and hands-on projects designed to build
confidence and expand the student's skill sets. It will continue throughout an
entire school year, meeting 2 hours a week. The project will culminate in a two
week ""camp,"" where our students will host 10-20 American high school
girls, teaching them some of the new skills learned throughout the year. We
believe that this unique cross-cultural ""camp"" will inspire the 25
girls in this program to share their experiences and new skills with other
Mongolian students.</p>

I can't wait to be sufficiently qualified to make a real difference; in fact, I have already been approached to volunteer interpret for d/Deaf attendees at Nine Worlds Geekfest Convention in August 2016 (which is coincidentally on my 35th birthday!)Thank you all so much in advance.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

At this time she lived with her single mother, an aunt, a niece and her five siblings in a small house with only two rooms. Her brother Kabali had just finished high school successfully. Later, after many letters, emails and some phone calls, I was invited to visit Uganda. Fortunately at least I accepted and I visited the first time in my life Uganda in September 2011.<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My first stay in Uganda was really a great experience. At first I was shocked by great poverty in Uganda. I realised that the average annual income in Uganda is $ 600 a year. After that, I soon realized that much of Uganda is under construction. But due to poverty, there is little progress. My special attention was at Uganda's school system, as most of Gladys' siblings are still going to school. Uganda's School system is totally different to the german school system.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/968659/files/20141029084408-gladys-nakalanzi-sendaula.png?1414597448"" src="""" style=""""/></p>After high school, Gladys was gifted with a small income. Her job was paid with a salary about only 200, - dollars / month... She managed to join Makerere University Business School and pay her tution fees. Before she had completed, her brother Kabali had to join University too. Therefore, Gladys had to stop her studies and started paying the tution fees for her brother. Beside that she had to pay for their house rent, feeding her other siblings and for their school fees. <br/><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/968663/files/20141029084441-kabali-samson.png?1414597481"" src="""" style=""""/></p>During Kabali's time at the University, tution fees were increased and Gladys could not manage to pay it anymore. Thank god, I was informed in time and I was able to help and contribute to his tution fees and support the family. This brought joy and happiness to the family. With my help Kabali could finish his studies.<p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>The school system and costs</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In Uganda, there is a compulsory education. Every ugandan has the right to go to school for seven years. A school year is divided into three terms, starting in January. Usually, all children start in the nursery school. This is similar to Kindergarten and / or preschool. Primary school is the next. Followed by the secondary school with six secondary classes starting with S1. The ""O"" level, you are finished with the completion of the class S4 (comparable middle school) and the ""A"" level ends with the completion of the class S6 (Abitur). After this, schooling is completed.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">After finishing S4 vocational training will start, if you pay for it. After finishing exame for S6 with success you can join university.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In Uganda only children whose parents have good financial income are able to attain good education and attend schools, especially in good standard private schools. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The cost for the parents include school fees, accommodation, food, school clothes, school supplies and transportation. School fees range between 250,000 and 1,000,000 Ush per Term ( $ 100 - $ 400), depending if there is a puplic or private school.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some examples: The salary of a primary school teacher is about 150,000 Ush. A teacher of a private secundary school is abount 350,000 Ush, a good payed office worker receives about 700,000 Ush. A litre of gasoline costs about 3,250 Ush.</p><br/><p></p><p><b>The Problem</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Even now, at the end of each term, students have to wait for their report cards up to three weeks. This is really a problem. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since many teachers write the repots by hand,  it takes a lot of time for the teachers to complete students' reports. Most classes have up to 100 students, Therefore, teachers need up to two - three weeks to write all report cards.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Kabali told me that this is called ""lausy weeks"" and it is hated by the students. During this time, schools incur unnecessary costs for food, accommodation, electricity, water and security most especially for boarding schools. This applies to about 20% of all students (approximately 8,500,000) !</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We calculated all together in average costs about $ 55 per student and year. These extra costs are charged to the parents and / or families as a part of school fees.</p><p>Kabali came up with an idea to create reports online, so that schools, students and parents can access thier results online at the end of every school term. We made a brain storming how to counteract this. It was christmas 2012 and after a few days we had a concrete idea and set about solving the problem. We still had no idea how extensive our project will be. But, it was the birth of <strong>""MyReport""</strong>.</p><h3><br/></h3><h3>MyReport - the Software</h3><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/968666/files/20141029084505-gerald-thormann.png?1414597505"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Upon my return to germany, I spoke with a programmer I knew. I could win him for our project. Since the beginning of January 2013 Gerald worked for free on the development and programming of the required software.<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In early May 2013 we had a first version ready and I could visit the first schools along with Kabali. In two months, we visited more than eighty private secondary schools. The schools were interested, but had lots of additional ideas and wishes.</p><p>This meant that our online solution was not sufficient.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since then we have continuously developed and updated our software. Now there is not only an online service, but also a print service for printing of certificates and report cards, an upload service for audit and holiday work, a communication service for teachers - parents / students and a website service for schools that still have no homepage.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><h3>Starting a business</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">To ensure that everything is legal, Gladys and Kabali registered <b>Myreport Uganda Limited</b>.

<br/><br/>Vorwort<br/><br/></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/968707/files/20141029085806-siegfried-brandt.png?1414598286"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Ende Januar 2011 lernte ich meine jetzige Verlobte Gladys kennen. Gladys stammt aus Uganda und lebte dort zusammen mit ihrer alleinerziehenden Mutter, einer Tante, ihren fünf Geschwistern und einer Nichte in einem kleinen Haus mit zwei Zimmern. Zu ihren Geschwistern gehört auch ihr Bruder Kabali, welcher zu der Zeit gerade die Highschool mit Erfolg beendet hatte. Nach längerem Brief und Emailkontakt sowie später einigen Telefongesprächen besuchte ich Gladys in Uganda.<br/>Mein erster Aufenthalt in Uganda war ein ganz tolles Erlebnis. Zuerst erschütterte mich die große Armut. Das durchschnittliche Jahreseinkommen liegt bei ca. 600 Dollar im Jahr. Danach erkannte ich bald, dass in Uganda vieles im Aufbau ist. Aber bedingt durch die Armut gibt es nur kleine Fortschritte. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit erregte das Schulsystem, da die Geschwister von Gladys alle noch zur Schule gehen. Es unterscheidet sich deutlich vom Deutschen Schulsystem.<br/><div>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/968728/files/20141029090835-gladys-nakalanzi-sendaula.png?1414598915"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Gladys begann nach der Highschool ein Studium an der Makerere Universität of Business in Kampala. Als sich ihre Eltern trennten, schaffte es ihre Mutter nicht die Studiengebühren aufzubringen. Deshalb musste Gladys ihr Studium abbrechen und nahm Mitte 2010 eine Arbeit an. Mit ihrem Einkommen in Höhe von 200,- Dollar/Monat ernährt sie jetzt die Familie, zahlt die Miete und unterstützt die Geschwister bei den Schulgebühren.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/968729/files/20141029090905-kabali-samson.png?1414598945"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Gladys, die auch ihren Bruder Kabali unterstützt, ist damit an die Grenze ihrer Möglichkeiten angelangt. Beinahe hätte Kabali nicht seinen Abschluss machen können. Hier konnte ich zum Glück unterstützen und bekam so einen sehr guten Einblick in das bestehende Schulsystem.<br/><br/><b>Das Schulsystem und Kosten</b><br/>In Uganda gibt es eine Schulpflicht bis zur Klasse 7. Ein Schuljahr ist in drei Terms unterteilt und beginnt in Januar. Üblicherweise starten alle Kinder in der Nurseryschool. Dieses ist vergleichbar mit Kindergarten und / oder Vorschule. Es folgt die Primary School, vergleichbar Grund- / Hauptschule, bis zur 7. Klasse. Danach folgt die Secundary School mit sechs weiterführenden Klassen beginnend mit S1. Das ""O"" Level beendet man mit Abschluß der Klasse S4 ( vergleichbar Mittlere Reife ) und das ""A"" Level endet mit Abschluß der Klasse S6 ( Abitur ). Damit ist diese schulische Ausbildung beendet.

Mit Abschluß S4 beginnt dann das Arbeitsleben mit Besuch einer ""Vocationalschool"" vergleichbar mit einer Berufschule, wenn denn die Eltern dieses finanzieren können. Allerdings entspricht das nicht unserem Dualen Ausbildungssystem ! Wer es schafft die Studiengebühren zu bezahlen hat mit erfolgreichem Abschluß des ""A"" Level die Chance ein Studium zu beginnen. Die übliche Studiendauer beträgt zwei Jahre.

Man sollte aber daran denken, dass nur Kinder deren Eltern über die entsprechende finanziellen Mittel verfügen, der Schulbesuch möglich ist, Dann kann man sogar eine der vielen guten privaten Schulen besuchen.

Die Kosten für die Eltern setzten sich aus Schulgebühren, Unterkunft, Verpflegung, Schulkleidung, Schulmaterialien und Transport zusammen. Sie liegen je nach Schule und Level zwischen ca. 250.000 Ush und über 1.000.000 Ush je Term. Ungerechnet sind das ca. 100 bis über 400 Dollar.

Einige Beispiele: Das Gehalt eines Grundschullehrers beträgt ca. 150.000 Ush. Ein Lehrer einer privaten Secundary School liegt bei ca, 350.000 Ush; Eine gute Bürokraft erhält ca. 700.000 Ush. Ein Liter Benzin kostet ca. 3.250 Ush.<br/><br/><b>Das Problem</b><br/>Am Ende eines jeden Terms sollten die Schüler ihre Zeiugnisse erhalten. Und hier gibt es ein großes Problem.

Viele Schule, bis auf wenige Ausnahmen eigentlich fast alle, erstellen die Zeugnisse noch von Hand. Bei Klassengrößen von bis zu 100 Schülern ist es somit kein Wunder, dass Lehrer bis zu zwei Wochen brauchen um das zu bewerkstelligen.

Von Kabali habe ich erfahren, dass dieser Zeitraum "" lausy weeks "" genannt und von den Schülern gehaßt wird zumal sehr oft der Unterricht ausfällt. In diesen 2 Wochen, in denen die Schüler zu Hause in den Familien fehlen, muss die Schule Personal, Räumlichkeiten und Verpflegung zur Verfügung stellen. Hierdurch entstehen den Schulen Kosten, die aber letztendlich die Familien über die Schulgebühren bezahlen müssen.

Auf Anregung Kabalis ( Seine Vorstellung war, dass die Schüler eine Klasse, ihre Noten online abfragen können ) haben wir uns Gedanken gemacht, wie man dem entgegenwirken könnte. Es war Weihnachten 2012 und nach einigen Tagen hatten wir eine konkrete Idee und machten uns an die Lösung des Problems. Noch ahnten wir nicht, wie umfangreich unser Projekt werden würde. Aber, es war die Geburtsstunde von ""MyReport"".<br/><br/><b>MyReport - die Software</b><br/>
Nach meiner Rückkehr habe ich mit einem befreundeten Programmierer gesprochen und konnte ihn für unser Projekt gewinnen. Seit Anfang Januar 2013 arbeitet Gerald unentgeldlich an der Entwicklung der benötigten Software.

Anfang Mai 2013 hatten wir eine erste Version fertig und ich konnte sie zusammen mit Kabali den ersten Schulen vorstellen. In zwei Monaten besuchten wir über achtzig private Secondary Schools. Die Schulen waren durch die Bank weg interessiert, hatten aber jede Menge zusätzlicher Wünsche und Ideen.

Das bedeutete für uns, dass unserer Online-Lösung nicht ausreichend war.

Wir haben seitdem unsere Software kontinuierlich weiter entwickelt und ergänzt. Nun gibt es nicht nur einen Online-Service, sondern auch einen Print-Service zum Drucken der Zeugnisse, einen Upload-Service für Prüfungs- und Ferienarbeiten, einen Communication-Service für Lehrer - Eltern / Schüler und einen Website-Service für Schulen die noch keine Homepage haben.

Bis Anfang 2014 haben wir nunmehr über 130 Schulen angesprochen. Am 16. November 2013 hatten wir unsere erste große Präsentation vor eingeladenen Vertretern von privaten Sekundarschulen im angemieteten Saal des Kolpinghotel Kampala. Das war für uns eine sehr enttäuschende und frustrierende Geschichte. Von 30 eingeladenen Schulen waren lediglich 10 % erschienen. Wenn denn abgesagt wurde, waren die Grund mehrheitlich, dass die Schule keine Zeit habe, da Prüfungen für S4 und S6 anstanden. Wir haben viel dazu gelernt und reichlich Lehrgeld gezahlt. Aber es geht weiter.

<br/>Wir wollen:

Schulen unterstützen um Kosten zu sparen und Lehrer zu entlasten. Wir wollen die Schulen ermutigen die so freiwerdenden Gelder in die Ausstattung der Schulen zu investieren und Stipendien zu vergeben. Hierdurch können wir zusammen mit den Schulen Kindern in Afrika zu mehr und besseren Unterricht verhelfen.  

 

<br/><br/>Durch unser Projekt erreichen wir die folgenden Ziele:

    <br/><ul>
<li>Kostensenkung für Schulen und Familien <br/>
</li>
<li>mehr Unterrichtszeit für Schulen <br/>
</li>
<li>Zeitgerechte Ausgabe von einheitlichen Zeugnissen <br/>
</li>
<li>längere Ferien für Schüler</li>
<li>Entlastung der Familien <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>Durch ihre Unterstützung können wir:<br/><ul>
<li>unsere Software weiter verbessern

Präsentationen organisieren um mehrere Schulen auf einmal zu erreichen </li>
<li>Einen Programmierer/IT-Techniker vor Ort mit ins Boot holen <br/>
</li>
<li>Einweisungen für Lehrer in die Bedienung der Software durchführen <br/>
</li>
<li>Arbeitsplätze schaffen <br/>
</li>
</ul>
- Als nächster Schritt ist geplant in den nächsten Wochen ein kleines Büro zu eröffnen, in dem die anfallenden Arbeiten erledigt und Besucher empfangen werden können. <br/>
- Später sollen landesweit kleine Büros eingerichtet werden, wo die Schulen zum Beispiel ihre gedruckten Zeugnisse abholen können.
<br/><br/><b>Dringende Notwendigkeit - ein Büro muß her !</b><br/>Leider müssen wir schon jetzt ein kleines Büro einrichten. Immer wieder haben die Schulen gefragt, wo denn unser Büro ist. Es wird einfach nicht akzeptiert, dass wir zu Hause arbeiten. Ein Unternehmen muss wohl in Uganda ein Büro haben. Hier zeigt sich, dass Uganda noch ein Entwicklungsland ist. In Deutschland / Europa ist soetwas mittlerweilen selbstverständlich.

Dieses war so noch nicht vorgesehen. Wir haben mittlerweile über 4.000 Arbeitsstunden ( umgerechnet über $ 400.000 ) für die Softwareentwicklung, Erstellung von Dokumentationen und Bedienungsanleitungen für die User usw... aufgebracht. Hinzu kamen Kosten für Flüge, Transport, Unterkunft, Verpflegung usw. Soll es das gewesen sein? Wir wollen und werden auf jeden Fall weitermachen.

Nach einen großen Kassensturz haben wir die Kosten für das erste Jahr ermittelt. Trotz vieler Einschränkungen und Abstriche, kam da doch noch einiges zusammen.<br/><br/><table style=""font-size: 16px;""><tbody>

Alles zusammen werden sich die Gesamtkosten, wenn wir voll durchstarten wollen, für jedes Jahr auf mindestens ca. $ 25.000 belaufen. Natürlich hoffen wir noch im Laufe des Jahres 2015 die ersten Schulen als Kunden gewinnen zu können. Aber dafür gibt es keine Garantie.<br/>

Als einer der nächsten Schritte ist ein Treffen mit dem Ministerium für Ausbildung und Sport geplant. Viele Schulen waren und sind an dieser Softwarelösung sehr interessiert, aber sie scheuen den nächsten bzw. den ersten Schritt zu gehen.

<a href=""#english"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back</a> to the english version!</div></div>","With our project we give, not only the schools in Uganda, the possibility to create quickly and promptly the certificates. The time saved can be used effectively for teaching. The latency of the students (called ""lausy weeks"") is omitted. The actual vacation time for the students will be extended. Costs for pupils, students and schools can be reduced. Für die deutsche Beschreibung bitte hier klicken!PrologSome years ago I got in touch with my fiancee Gladys, who is ugandan. At this time she lived with her single mother, an aunt, a niece and her five siblings in a small house with only two rooms. Her brother Kabali had just finished high school successfully. Later, after many letters, emails and some phone calls, I was invited to visit Uganda. Fortunately at least I accepted and I visited the first time in my life Uganda in September 2011.My first stay in Uganda was really a great experience. At first I was shocked by great poverty in Uganda. I realised that the average annual income in Uganda is $ 600 a year. After that, I soon realized that much of Uganda is under construction. But due to poverty, there is little progress. My special attention was at Uganda's school system, as most of Gladys' siblings are still going to school. Uganda's School system is totally different to the german school system.After high school, Gladys was gifted with a small income. Her job was paid with a salary about only 200, - dollars / month... She managed to join Makerere University Business School and pay her tution fees. Before she had completed, her brother Kabali had to join University too. Therefore, Gladys had to stop her studies and started paying the tution fees for her brother. Beside that she had to pay for their house rent, feeding her other siblings and for their school fees. During Kabali's time at the University, tution fees were increased and Gladys could not manage to pay it anymore. Thank god, I was informed in time and I was able to help and contribute to his tution fees and support the family. This brought joy and happiness to the family. With my help Kabali could finish his studies.The school system and costsIn Uganda, there is a compulsory education. Every ugandan has the right to go to school for seven years. A school year is divided into three terms, starting in January. Usually, all children start in the nursery school. This is similar to Kindergarten and / or preschool. Primary school is the next. Followed by the secondary school with six secondary classes starting with S1. The ""O"" level, you are finished with the completion of the class S4 (comparable middle school) and the ""A"" level ends with the completion of the class S6 (Abitur). After this, schooling is completed.After finishing S4 vocational training will start, if you pay for it. After finishing exame for S6 with success you can join university.In Uganda only children whose parents have good financial income are able to attain good education and attend schools, especially in good standard private schools. The cost for the parents include school fees, accommodation, food, school clothes, school supplies and transportation. School fees range between 250,000 and 1,000,000 Ush per Term ( $ 100 - $ 400), depending if there is a puplic or private school.Some examples: The salary of a primary school teacher is about 150,000 Ush. A teacher of a private secundary school is abount 350,000 Ush, a good payed office worker receives about 700,000 Ush. A litre of gasoline costs about 3,250 Ush.The ProblemEven now, at the end of each term, students have to wait for their report cards up to three weeks. This is really a problem. Since many teachers write the repots by hand,  it takes a lot of time for the teachers to complete students' reports. Most classes have up to 100 students, Therefore, teachers need up to two - three weeks to write all report cards.Kabali told me that this is called ""lausy weeks"" and it is hated by the students. During this time, schools incur unnecessary costs for food, accommodation, electricity, water and security most especially for boarding schools. This applies to about 20% of all students (approximately 8,500,000) !We calculated all together in average costs about $ 55 per student and year. These extra costs are charged to the parents and / or families as a part of school fees.Kabali came up with an idea to create reports online, so that schools, students and parents can access thier results online at the end of every school term. We made a brain storming how to counteract this. It was christmas 2012 and after a few days we had a concrete idea and set about solving the problem. We still had no idea how extensive our project will be. But, it was the birth of ""MyReport"".MyReport - the SoftwareUpon my return to germany, I spoke with a programmer I knew. I could win him for our project. Since the beginning of January 2013 Gerald worked for free on the development and programming of the required software.In early May 2013 we had a first version ready and I could visit the first schools along with Kabali. In two months, we visited more than eighty private secondary schools. The schools were interested, but had lots of additional ideas and wishes.This meant that our online solution was not sufficient.Since then we have continuously developed and updated our software. Now there is not only an online service, but also a print service for printing of certificates and report cards, an upload service for audit and holiday work, a communication service for teachers - parents / students and a website service for schools that still have no homepage.Starting a businessTo ensure that everything is legal, Gladys and Kabali registered Myreport Uganda Limited. Below is our Certificate of Incorporation.TargetsWe want to:Support schools, to reduce costs ( in average, from $ 11 down to $ 3  per student  and per year ! ) and relieve teachers. We want to encourage schools to support students with the inserted money and invest money in school equipment and provide scholarships. In this way we can help to bring more and better education along for the school children in Uganda and  later on in other african countries.Through our project, we achieve the following objectives:
Reduce costs for schools and families
more class time for schools/students/pupils
Timely issue of uniform products
Longer holidays for students
Relief for families
With your support, we can:
further improve our sofware
organize presentations to several schools at once
give a jobs to local programmers / IT technicans
conduct briefings for teachers in the use of the software
create further jobs
As a next step, it is planned to open a small office in Kampala, where we can work at the project, doing the necessary work and receiving visitors.Later on, small nationwide offices can support schools that have no IT-lab where they can pick their printed report cards. 

Software presentationWe are going two ways to present our sofware.One way is to present our software to the management ( headteachers, directors and IT-teachers ) of the visited schools. It is a big problem to get an appointment. You have to visit them mostly several times to get this date and this means to take a lot of time and money.The other way is to organize presentations. In November 2013 we organized our first big presentation. Therefore we invited 30 private secondary schools to send their representatives to Kampala Kolping Hotel at the 16th November 2013. Unfortunately end of year exams were running and there have been only a few representatives. Any way it was very exciting, a great experience and we have learnt a lot.

Presentation software ""MyReport""Very attentive school representatives

The final picture of our first presentation


Office required - urgentlyWe have to set up an office because the school representatives have always asked us where our office is. They do not believe that we work at home. Unlike in Germany, in Uganda an office at home is not taken serious and not considered as an office.We had not planned to pay extra money for an office as we had hoped to work at home. Up to now we have spend more than 4,500 hours with hard work (equivalent to over $ 460,000) for software development, preparation of documentation and manuals for users, and more. In addition, costs of flights, transportation, accommodation, meals, the presentation at the Kolping Hotel, etc. We want to, and we will continue our way, in any case.
Expected CostsAfter a research, we came up with a budget for expected costs as shown below:


Running costs for an office (approx.):
 $/month


 rental
200,00


 power
 20,00


 water
7,00

4 presentations with about 80-100 school representatives
$/Present.


 Rent for a Meeting room / hall

All together there will be costs, for the first two years of about $ 50,000. Of course, we hope to win the first schools as customers during the year 2015.
If we receive more support as needed, the funds are fully incorporated into our social engagement.

Our objective economic and social intention
It is planned that the use of My Report will cost the schools in the base version not more than maximum $ 0.50 - 1.00 per student per year. So that we can cover the running costs and still earn some profit.
We will continue our way (see above), therefore we believe in our success, that we will be able in future , to support childrens, pupils & students. That we are able to support families to give their children an education and /or to learn a profession.
Further on we are working on other social projects to help the people in Africa. We also want to enable children from poor families to attend school and support students.
Thank you for reading. We would be very pleased to welcome you as one of our donators.

Deutsche ProjektbeschreibungMit unserem Projekt geben wir nicht nur Schulen in Uganda die Möglichkeit schnell und einfach Zeugnisse und Bescheinigungen für ihre Schüler und Studenten auszustellen. Die eingesparte Zeit kann effektiver zum Lehren genutzt werden. Die Wartezeiten der Schüler und Studenten (""lausy weeks"" genannt) fallen weg. Die tatsächliche Ferienzeit für die Schüler würde sich verlängern. Kosten für Schüler, Studenten und Schulen können reduziert werden.

Vorwort
Ende Januar 2011 lernte ich meine jetzige Verlobte Gladys kennen. Gladys stammt aus Uganda und lebte dort zusammen mit ihrer alleinerziehenden Mutter, einer Tante, ihren fünf Geschwistern und einer Nichte in einem kleinen Haus mit zwei Zimmern. Zu ihren Geschwistern gehört auch ihr Bruder Kabali, welcher zu der Zeit gerade die Highschool mit Erfolg beendet hatte. Nach längerem Brief und Emailkontakt sowie später einigen Telefongesprächen besuchte ich Gladys in Uganda.Mein erster Aufenthalt in Uganda war ein ganz tolles Erlebnis. Zuerst erschütterte mich die große Armut. Das durchschnittliche Jahreseinkommen liegt bei ca. 600 Dollar im Jahr. Danach erkannte ich bald, dass in Uganda vieles im Aufbau ist. Aber bedingt durch die Armut gibt es nur kleine Fortschritte. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit erregte das Schulsystem, da die Geschwister von Gladys alle noch zur Schule gehen. Es unterscheidet sich deutlich vom Deutschen Schulsystem.
Gladys begann nach der Highschool ein Studium an der Makerere Universität of Business in Kampala. Als sich ihre Eltern trennten, schaffte es ihre Mutter nicht die Studiengebühren aufzubringen. Deshalb musste Gladys ihr Studium abbrechen und nahm Mitte 2010 eine Arbeit an. Mit ihrem Einkommen in Höhe von 200,- Dollar/Monat ernährt sie jetzt die Familie, zahlt die Miete und unterstützt die Geschwister bei den Schulgebühren.Gladys, die auch ihren Bruder Kabali unterstützt, ist damit an die Grenze ihrer Möglichkeiten angelangt. Beinahe hätte Kabali nicht seinen Abschluss machen können. Hier konnte ich zum Glück unterstützen und bekam so einen sehr guten Einblick in das bestehende Schulsystem.Das Schulsystem und KostenIn Uganda gibt es eine Schulpflicht bis zur Klasse 7. Ein Schuljahr ist in drei Terms unterteilt und beginnt in Januar. Üblicherweise starten alle Kinder in der Nurseryschool. Dieses ist vergleichbar mit Kindergarten und / oder Vorschule. Es folgt die Primary School, vergleichbar Grund- / Hauptschule, bis zur 7. Klasse. Danach folgt die Secundary School mit sechs weiterführenden Klassen beginnend mit S1. Das ""O"" Level beendet man mit Abschluß der Klasse S4 ( vergleichbar Mittlere Reife ) und das ""A"" Level endet mit Abschluß der Klasse S6 ( Abitur ). Damit ist diese schulische Ausbildung beendet.

Mit Abschluß S4 beginnt dann das Arbeitsleben mit Besuch einer ""Vocationalschool"" vergleichbar mit einer Berufschule, wenn denn die Eltern dieses finanzieren können. Allerdings entspricht das nicht unserem Dualen Ausbildungssystem ! Wer es schafft die Studiengebühren zu bezahlen hat mit erfolgreichem Abschluß des ""A"" Level die Chance ein Studium zu beginnen. Die übliche Studiendauer beträgt zwei Jahre.

Man sollte aber daran denken, dass nur Kinder deren Eltern über die entsprechende finanziellen Mittel verfügen, der Schulbesuch möglich ist, Dann kann man sogar eine der vielen guten privaten Schulen besuchen.

Die Kosten für die Eltern setzten sich aus Schulgebühren, Unterkunft, Verpflegung, Schulkleidung, Schulmaterialien und Transport zusammen. Sie liegen je nach Schule und Level zwischen ca. 250.000 Ush und über 1.000.000 Ush je Term. Ungerechnet sind das ca. 100 bis über 400 Dollar.

Einige Beispiele: Das Gehalt eines Grundschullehrers beträgt ca. 150.000 Ush. Ein Lehrer einer privaten Secundary School liegt bei ca, 350.000 Ush; Eine gute Bürokraft erhält ca. 700.000 Ush. Ein Liter Benzin kostet ca. 3.250 Ush.Das ProblemAm Ende eines jeden Terms sollten die Schüler ihre Zeiugnisse erhalten. Und hier gibt es ein großes Problem.

Viele Schule, bis auf wenige Ausnahmen eigentlich fast alle, erstellen die Zeugnisse noch von Hand. Bei Klassengrößen von bis zu 100 Schülern ist es somit kein Wunder, dass Lehrer bis zu zwei Wochen brauchen um das zu bewerkstelligen.

Von Kabali habe ich erfahren, dass dieser Zeitraum "" lausy weeks "" genannt und von den Schülern gehaßt wird zumal sehr oft der Unterricht ausfällt. In diesen 2 Wochen, in denen die Schüler zu Hause in den Familien fehlen, muss die Schule Personal, Räumlichkeiten und Verpflegung zur Verfügung stellen. Hierdurch entstehen den Schulen Kosten, die aber letztendlich die Familien über die Schulgebühren bezahlen müssen.

Auf Anregung Kabalis ( Seine Vorstellung war, dass die Schüler eine Klasse, ihre Noten online abfragen können ) haben wir uns Gedanken gemacht, wie man dem entgegenwirken könnte. Es war Weihnachten 2012 und nach einigen Tagen hatten wir eine konkrete Idee und machten uns an die Lösung des Problems. Noch ahnten wir nicht, wie umfangreich unser Projekt werden würde. Aber, es war die Geburtsstunde von ""MyReport"".MyReport - die Software
Nach meiner Rückkehr habe ich mit einem befreundeten Programmierer gesprochen und konnte ihn für unser Projekt gewinnen. Seit Anfang Januar 2013 arbeitet Gerald unentgeldlich an der Entwicklung der benötigten Software.

Anfang Mai 2013 hatten wir eine erste Version fertig und ich konnte sie zusammen mit Kabali den ersten Schulen vorstellen. In zwei Monaten besuchten wir über achtzig private Secondary Schools. Die Schulen waren durch die Bank weg interessiert, hatten aber jede Menge zusätzlicher Wünsche und Ideen.

Das bedeutete für uns, dass unserer Online-Lösung nicht ausreichend war.

Wir haben seitdem unsere Software kontinuierlich weiter entwickelt und ergänzt. Nun gibt es nicht nur einen Online-Service, sondern auch einen Print-Service zum Drucken der Zeugnisse, einen Upload-Service für Prüfungs- und Ferienarbeiten, einen Communication-Service für Lehrer - Eltern / Schüler und einen Website-Service für Schulen die noch keine Homepage haben.

Bis Anfang 2014 haben wir nunmehr über 130 Schulen angesprochen. Am 16. November 2013 hatten wir unsere erste große Präsentation vor eingeladenen Vertretern von privaten Sekundarschulen im angemieteten Saal des Kolpinghotel Kampala. Das war für uns eine sehr enttäuschende und frustrierende Geschichte. Von 30 eingeladenen Schulen waren lediglich 10 % erschienen. Wenn denn abgesagt wurde, waren die Grund mehrheitlich, dass die Schule keine Zeit habe, da Prüfungen für S4 und S6 anstanden. Wir haben viel dazu gelernt und reichlich Lehrgeld gezahlt. Aber es geht weiter.

 
Gründung eines Unternehmens
Damit alles seine Ordnung hat, ließen am 21. Februar 2013, Gladys und ihr Bruder dieses Unternehmen bei den zuständigen Behörden registrieren.

</div></div>","What Is BLISS?

 BLISS exists for one reason - to provide adolescent girls an education while simultaneously lifting them out of poverty through high-fashion. 

It enables school attendance for girls who would otherwise be driven by poverty to work full-time
instead.  


Before
 BLISS, enrolled girls spent 14 hours every day working at carpet looms. 
Now, they come to school, learn English, Urdu, and Math as well as
embroidery in a 1-hour skills class. The embroidered fabric is finished into trendy handbags for sale in 
global markets. The money goes back to the girls so they can support their families while getting an education - win-win!

You can
view the complete collection of handbags here. AND when you contribute, you can claim your choice of an exquisite handbag from the collection; view perks to find out how!








How We Know It Works




BLISS is bringing 30 girls to school in Pakistan, giving them education & practical skills 


Girls' hourly income has increased by 60% through BLISS, compared to when working full-time

Attendance rates are now at 90%, higher than ever at these schools
Our first line of handbags sold out within weeks; we are now struggling to meet demand!

BLISS has also instilled a sense of dignity, pride and self-confidence in the girls. School is now perceived as more fun, relevant and practical.
""BLISS has reduced the burden of education on my father. I love coming to school to study and embroider with other girls!"" - Fatima, 14 years old.

How We Can Grow With Your Help
BLISS sold out its first line of handbags in June 2011 in
Pakistan. Dozens more girls want to join and are wait-listed for enrollment.
We
 don't have enough bags to meet the demand; and we don't have the funds 
to enroll more girls to scale operations!

With the funds from the campaign here, plus matching grants we are raising from investors, we aim to:


Scale from the current 30 to 120 girls in 2012

Launch our products in 6 cities - London, Paris, New York, Seattle, Boulder & Nairobi - through a network of female ambassadors, between Feb & Apr 2012 
Launch a financial literacy curriculum for the girls in December 2011
Design and launch a brand new logo & website, to spread our mission and products globally


The more
handbags produced and sold, the more students BLISS can educate and train - it's a virtuous cycle. $300 keeps 1 girl
in school for 1 year!


A BLISSful Vision
BLISS' vision is that of no girl left behind, of every young girl able to define the
course of her own life. There is no simple or obvious future for millions of young girls without
BLISS - a culturally acceptable solution to a highly intractable problem.

</div><p><b><u>Summary</u></b></p>
<p><b><i>Friends of Tara</i></b> is a group of friends dedicated to celebrating
the life and memory of Tara McCartney. Each year, we launch a campaign to
capture the spirit of this remarkable woman. Tara was extremely kind and
thoughtful. She had a knack of providing just what was needed to those around
her – a dear note, beautiful handcrafted piece of jewelry or just the perfect
trinket. As a point of inspiration, we decided to leverage this spirit of thoughtfulness
to spotlight two worthy entities – <b>Vista
Maria </b>and the <b>Tara Partrice
McCartney (nee Ervin) Scholarship Fund</b>. By contributing to this campaign, <b><i>Friends
of Tara</i></b> will put basic necessities into hands of young girls in
Vista Maria’s Community Program and provide financing to a scholarship fund
that provides $1,000 each year to two students. </p>
<p><b><u>What We Need &amp; What You
Get</u></b></p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise $1,000 to help support the
scholarship and provide at least 30 hygiene kits, water bottles, or pairs of gloves to Vista Maria. Any monetary proceeds from this campaign
will go directly to the scholarship fund. This is our way of keeping Tara in
our hearts as well as spreading a little bit of her joy and love to others.</p>
<p>We selected <b>Sweetest Day </b>as the ideal time to kick this campaign off. In the spirit of giving, we
have established several unique perks for the kindness shown by the campaign's
contributors:</p>

<h3>Why is this important…</h3>
<div>We hear the term worldy which denotes traveling to a foreign country. There are amazing musicians within this program that have never even travelled outside of our metropolitan area. Going into the ""city"" to Governor's School is the the best thing that has happened to them!</div>
<div>Imagine the ripple effect you can create when sponsoring the efforts of these musicians. These students not only visit Europe, but have the opportunity to play in Innsbrook and Salzburg for all to hear. The ripple is larger than you can imagine!

<p>Our children will be the first generation in history to live a shorter life than their parents! By the age of 11, one third of our children are already overweight or obese. It’s time for change and more focused help for children.</p>

<p>We have developed the Kool Kidz programme for primary schools to tackle childhood obesity, involving the three most important people in a child’s formative years – the parents, the teachers and the child.</p>

<p>We use a combination of fun ways to learn about nutrition, taking part in activity without it feeling like hard work, recognising and changing behavioural habits and using cool stuff like social media, texting and our own Youtube channel to deliver the programme.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>It’s all ready to go: we’ve got our expert team ready to get started in the Summer term. But we need your help to fund the first trials in two primary schools. We’ve found two Head Teachers willing to pilot the Kool Kidz programme and we need to cover their costs and time away from their other duties during the trial. If we raise £5,000 we can do one trial. £10,000 will support both trials and any contributions above that will support the roll-out into other schools across the country.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our programme has scale and the potential for national reach. Here’s how we plan to increase the impact of campaign:</p>
<p>March to June: Raise funds and run a 12 week trial programme in two schools</p>
<p>May to July: Make local authorities aware of Kool Kidz</p>

<p>Mt. Airy USA (MAUSA) is an experienced organization with a long-standing commitment to the revitalization of the Germantown Avenue corridor and the Mt. Airy neighborhood.  Our commercial corridor and real estate development activities have leveraged millions of dollars in private and public investment to Mt. Airy, attracted numerous new businesses, created hundreds of jobs, and substantially increased property values. Our comprehensive approach to corridor revitalization includes physical improvements, marketing and promotion, and business retention and recruitment activities. We recently completed a streetscape improvement project on The Avenue to install new pedestrian-scale lighting, sidewalks, curbs, trees and benches.  Over the past ten years, we have assisted over seventy business and commercial property owners to complete storefront renovations and launched the Mt. Airy Business Improvement District to provide street cleaning and beautification.</p>
<p>MAUSA believes that transforming the physical environment into beautiful, value-added and active space can change human behavior and improve the day-to-day quality of life of the people around it.  We also believe that people take added care of space they can be proud of and feel invested in. This has been proven qualitatively and quantitatively. </p>

<h3>From New York to Naka...JAPAN, THAT IS!</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Tanya! In just a few short weeks I'll be leaving my home, my parents and my friends to live in Japan and teach English to school children. I need your help to make this transition. I've exhausted all other options and unfortunately my parents aren't able to assist me. Without these funds, I won't be able to go to Japan at all.</p>
<p>In 2011, I graduated from Sarah Lawrence College, having majored in Japanese Language. I started studying Japanese from the start of my enrollment, and for my junior year I studied abroad in Kyoto with the Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies. It was an amazing experience. And though I was happy that my Japanese had improved, I was more so fortunate to have been a part of the culture (even if only for a year) and grateful for the generosity of the people around me.</p>
<p>This time around, things will be a little different. The JET Program (Japan Exchange and Teaching Program) is a well-known and prestigious organization that connects people from all over the world to schools all over Japan. It was highly recommended by all of my Japanese teachers and tutors while I was in college. I'll be living on the island of Shikoku in a city named Naka, and will be working full-time as an assistant English teacher.</p>
<p>JET is great because the main components are done for us; housing is found for us (though we do pay rent) and our jobs are set up and waiting for us. There is also a wonderful support system and alum network.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My campaign is to raise money to help my transition process. The amount that I'm asking for is the amount the program suggests we arrive in Japan with, as it will be about a month before we get our first paycheck. So, we'll be responsible for our rent, utilities, travel expenses, and food.</p>
<p>In return, you get anything from a thank you on the social network of your choosing to a personalized package shipped to you with various goodies from Japan (there will probably be tasty snacks included, just saying).</p>
<p>ANYTHING HELPS! I only ask that you give what you won't miss, and I wouldn't ask if I didn't need to. If you can't give at all, I just ask that you please spread the word.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is important to me for many reasons, some of which I can't even express. I'm looking to start a new life doing something I'm very passionate about and in a place I am greatly interested in. I hope that through donating, you all feel like you're a part of this, too.</p>

While the program began informally on the third floor of a school building in Bushwick, Brooklyn, our ESL curriculum has always focused on the value of our learners’ life experiences as the starting point. Throughout the years, MCIF began to offer more levels of instruction and the program has grown to include five levels of English ranging from Beginner to Advanced, computer-based instruction hours, and individual literacy assistance.
</p><p>In addition to formal class instruction, MCIF Center enhances our participants’ English education and public speaking skills through English presentations throughout the academic year. Celebrations at the Center include Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother’s Day, and International Women’s Day.</p>
<h2>ESL Computer Component</h2>
<p>Each English class utilizes MCIF Center’s state-of-the-art computer lab with a variety of ESL software programs once per week. Participants learn to navigate the internet while gaining English skills through online activities.</p>
<h2>ESL Literacy Component</h2>
<p>MCIF participants who have difficulty reading and writing in their own language are able to receive one-on-one assistance with the MCIF Literacy Instructor once per week. The One-On-One Literacy component of the ESL program aims enhance our participants’ ability to read and write in English.</p>
<p>As a pilot program in the ESL program, Level 4 ESL participants visit lower level classrooms to facilitate discussions and lead other exercises. MCIF Center believes that peer teaching/learning is incredibly valuable for both higher and lower level English learners.</p>
<h2>Education Beyond the Classroom</h2>
<p>The Open Arms Project addresses our participants’ needs outside of the English classroom. Through our partnerships with other community-based organizations and city agencies, our participants obtain valuable knowledge to support their lives in a holistic way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to fund our amazing ESL Program!  We are raising money to employ an additional instructor, weekend classes, and new study materials for ESL in the Brooklyn community. All funds raised will go directly to the instructor's salary and purchasing new reading materials and study guides for our participants.  Since we mainly assist lower-income individuals, this money is not only integral, but incredibly necessary.  </p>
<p>In return for your generous donations, we will provide various gifts fom handmade jewelry to Yankee baseball games.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>The Impact</h3>
This project is invaluable to the Brooklyn community, as we ensure that ESL classes are available and affordable to anyone interested, whether a long-term resident of New York or a first-time visitor to the United States.  Our goal is a fully integrated, dynamic, and diverse population who can communicate freely, obtain jobs and education without discrimination, and succeed in our society.  Your donations will directly make this possible and we cannot thank you enough. <p></p>

The Open Arms Project addresses our participants’ needs outside of the English classroom. Through our partnerships with other community-based organizations and city agencies, our participants obtain valuable knowledge to support their lives in a holistic way.


What We Need & What You Get
We need your help to fund our amazing ESL Program!  We are raising money to employ an additional instructor, weekend classes, and new study materials for ESL in the Brooklyn community. All funds raised will go directly to the instructor's salary and purchasing new reading materials and study guides for our participants.  Since we mainly assist lower-income individuals, this money is not only integral, but incredibly necessary.  
In return for your generous donations, we will provide various gifts fom handmade jewelry to Yankee baseball games.


The Impact
This project is invaluable to the Brooklyn community, as we ensure that ESL classes are available and affordable to anyone interested, whether a long-term resident of New York or a first-time visitor to the United States.  Our goal is a fully integrated, dynamic, and diverse population who can communicate freely, obtain jobs and education without discrimination, and succeed in our society.  Your donations will directly make this possible and we cannot thank you enough. 

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand if you cannot donate, but if you could please help spread the word, it would be greatly appreciated! All you gotta do is use this link and spread the love! Thanks so much from everyone at MCIF!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We are Jonathan and Celeste Barnard and we have been working with kids for the last 15 years. On December 31st of last year we left our job, sold our house, and moved in with my parents to work on building a Ranch, Farm, and Camp for families and kids. A place we call BIG RED'S RANCH</p>
<h2>BIG RED</h2>
<p>It's named after Big Red, our puppet mascot. He represents the kids we want to focus on helping. Big Red is one of those kids <span class=""userContent"">who is st<span class=""text_exposed_show"">arved for attention, he interrupts and acts crazy, his dad is not involved in his life. We want to help kids who many schools, churches, and even parents aren't sure what to do with. We want to build a place for all families and kids, but most importantly a place for all the Big Red's in this world!</span></span></p>
<h2>BIG RED FOUNDERS</h2>
<p>We can't do this alone, we need people like you to become founders with us. Founders of Big Red's Ranch and founders of a movement to Fight for the Fatherless. The hardest part of doing anything is starting it. We have potential large gifts and even grants but we need to be established and functioning. We need people who will believe in us even when we don't have much to show them so that we can get up and running and gain momentum. We need Big Red Founders like you!</p>
<h2>THE PLAN</h2>
<p>Through this Indiegogo project we want to raise money to help us start getting some momentum. We are working to purchase a ranch in the Rio Grande Valley (Texas) as our base but my vision is to have multiple locations accross the country. You can find more information at <a href=""http://bigredministries.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bigredministries.org</a> and you can follow Big Red's Summer at <a href=""http://helpbigred.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://helpbigred.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We wil use the money from this project for three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Events. We want to do a Father/Son Campount, a Father/Daughter retreat, and a Family event this fall. These events will help us get moving forward and will illustrate some of the things we want to do at the Ranch. We have hosted Father/Son campouts in the past and they always encourage dads who are not involved to to get invloved in their sons lives. We will have sponsors for kids who need them and we will make sure that extra care are given to these kids throughout the weekend.</li>
<li>Earnest money toward the purchase of the ranch. In order to negotiate a contract on a property earnest money will be required.</li>
<li>Operating Costs. We would like to join a camp association and get some advice and consulting. We would like to do more advertising to get the word out on what we are doing.</li>
</ol><h2>COLLECTIBLES AND FUN</h2>
<p>We think Big Red is aaaaaaaawesome and we hope you do too! We will continue to add fun items and collectibles throughout the campaign so check back often to be part of the fun! Also once we have all the details for our events this will be one of the places you can sign up and pay or pay for a child to attend.</p>
<h2><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN PARTNER WITH US<br/></strong></h2>
<p>I know that God has called us to give you an opportunity to be a part of what He is doing.

<h3>If You Can Walk, You Can Dance...</h3>
<p>My name is Leigh Gaymon-Jones, and I am inspired by the intersection of social justice, community-buidling and creative movement.</p>
<p>I have been engaging in Community Dance for at least 6 years, and along the way I have learned a lot about movement and community engagement. Now it's time for the next leg of this journey! In the fall, I will move to London, England to deepen my study of Community Dance at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance as a student in the Postgraduate Diploma in Community Dance Program. I am excited to return to the States upon completion of my degree, to share creative movement with a diverse mix of people in a wide range of communities. But to get there, I need community support. </p>
<p>After earning a BA from Temple University in African-American Studies, Psychology and Spanish, I found myself drawn towards dance. I followed my impulse and relocated to my hometown, Austin, to study contemporary dance, improv and choreography at Austin Community College with some of Austin's premiere dance artists -- Darla Johhson, Allison Orr, Kathy Dunn Hamrick and Jose Bustamante. I was introduced to the idea of dance as a social justice and community-building tool when I attended two of Urban Bush Women's Summer Leadership Institutes (with an emphasis on Black communities), two of the Dance Exchange's summer dance intensives (with an emphasis on intergenerational dancers) and a workshop with Body Shift, here in Austin (with an emphasis on dancers of all physical abilities). </p>
<p>I have continued to work in Community Dance by working with Forklift Danceworks as a Leaps and Bounds creative movement teacher, stage managing The Trash Project and co-choreographing New Grrl Order, the opening to the 2012 Fusebox Festival. I have also explored a wide range of approaches to creating movement by performing with local artists including Jean Claude Lessou, Christina Sukhgian Houle, Ellen Bartel and Heloise Gold. </p>
<p>Help me to develop my dance tool kit so that I can share dance with everyone!</p>

<h3>Breaking Down the Steps</h3>
<p>Even with a partial scholarship from Laban, I have yet to secure the remaining $17,000 of my tuition. Although my total living costs for the year are $37,000  (tuition, housing, food, transportation, books &amp; supplies ), I am only asking for $15,000 in this campaign to cover the following: </p>

<p>We are Thao and Julie, the two sophomores from Cornell College (IA).  We would like to start with a simple story which inspired us to do what we are doing today.</p>
<h3><strong>The story</strong></h3>
<p>Coming back to Vietnam for the summer vacation, we happened to have the chance to work with one of the UNICEF Next Generation Vietnam’s projects.  A brief talk by a member of Next Gen’s Steering Committee made us think.  He told us a scene from a movie he saw recently: A building was on fire and a man was stuck in there, waving his hands out of the windows for help. A woman standing across the street saw that and yelled: “Somebody do something.” Another voice replied: “You are somebody. Do something!”</p>
<p>The story has been embedded in our minds.  We have been thinking over and over again that very simple yet impactful message: “In life we often wonder why somebody doesn’t do something. Then we realize that we are that somebody” (anonymous) We can help the children from different corners of the country and the world who are suffering from the lack of fresh water or dying from preventable causes like diarrhea, measles, or polio…etc.</p>
<h3>The awakening </h3>
<p> Growing up healthily and living a comfortably life, we hardly thought of paying much attention to what other children are suffering from<strong>.  </strong>However, the program that we joined this summer with UNICEF offered us a solution; therefore, we aspired to start a UNICEF chapter at Cornell College to share our experience and to bring more knowledge about children to other people, starting from the small environment where we are living: Cornell campus.  And that’s why we are here, trying to make this happen: A UNICEF Initiative Club called Believe in ZERO-Cornell for UNICEF, to join the global wave of achieving the mission:<em><strong> “ZERO” children dying from preventable causes and suffering from lacking necessities.</strong> </em> We are currently going through the process to be officially recognized by the UNICEF U.S Fund and also by Cornell Student Senate.</p>
<h2>WHY WE ARE HERE- WHAT YOU CAN HELP</h2>
<p> For any clubs to run successfully, skills and passion are pivotal.  Luckily, we see an opportunity to<em> learn the essential skills</em> and to<em> kindle our passion</em> through workshops, training and keynote speakers at the <strong>UNICEF Initiative Summit 2013. </strong> We are hoping to send three of our student leaders to this summit, incluing Thao Luu, Jess Reed, and me.  Unfortunately, since we had the idea of starting our club in the summer, we are unable to call for a great budget for airfares from our Student Senate.  We thus would like to ask for help from the community to raise a fund of $1,500 for the three members of the executive board to attend this great summit.</p>
<p>In addition to workshops and keynotes, we will also have a chance to participate in the two: a Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF extravaganza, which will take place throughout New York City, and an Emergency Simulation that will allow us to experience a day in the life of a UNICEF field staff member.</p>
<p>With all those great activities at the Summit, we are sure that our student leaders will learn a lot to educate and impact our peers and our community afterwards, allowing us to fulfill the missions of our UNICEF Initiative Club as well as UNICEF worldwide.  We would greatly appreciate your support to help us reach our goals.</p>

<p>Join our campaign to fund a proven math education tool that
helps both children and adults, finally, “get” math.</p>
<p>It can even help improve the performance of those that are doing
well with math!  </p>
<p>FUNdamentallyMath has been used by a select few over the last two
decades to increase their performance by up to two grade levels.  It’s now time to upgrade and put it on the
Internet so that everyone has a chance to access it. </p>
<p>What is It?</p>
<p>FUNdamentallyMATH, in
its original form,
is a
proven, powerful math software tool that has helped children and adults understand mathematics.  It covers the full suite of math from the
basics of 1+1 through advanced algebra (Calculus  to be added)</p>
<p>A select few have used this product to
improve performance by up to two grade levels in less than 3 months, and now it
is time to  give everyone a chance to do
the same.  </p>
<p>Why is FUNdamentallyMATH important?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>According
to the National Center for Education Statistics in the US, “The
Nation’s Report Card, Mathematics 2011”, 59% of all 4th and 66%
of 8th graders lacked proficiency in math.  Although this is a slowly improving trend it
means that
over 36 million
of the  61 million students in kindergarten through high
school cannot demonstrate competency over challenging subject matter at their
grade level.  Proficient has also been
defined as solid academic performance for each grade assessed.  </p>
<p>

These
results
are not significantly different from the 2005 results, which also reported
outcomes by race.  When reviewed by race,
over 90% of African American, 60% of White, 84% of Hispanic, and 80% of
American Indian students lacked math proficiency. This
level of proficiency should be significantly improved based on the
pervasiveness of technology and other science and math related changes in the
way we work and live. <br/>The coding for this product is very
complex and requires the developer to be proficient in mathematics. The funds
we raise during our campaign will go towards upgrading the program for Internet
access, and incorporating the content into a serious-game platform that will
allow collaboration among users.  Funds
will also be used to set-up the infrastructure of the business including a new
website and back office operations to support user subscriptions and track
performance, and nationwide Public Relations and Marketing. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A formal study conducted by the University of North Carolina, showed
that FUNdamentallyMATH was effective to the 95th
percentile and helped users increase their raw end of grade scores by over 20
points with one hour a week use over ten weeks. This is a winning solution to a generational issue! Visit our Life Blog to learn more <a href=""http://www.LiveForResults.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.LiveForResults.blogspot.com</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What's Required?</p>
<p></p>
<p> The full cost of product development exceeds
$3 million, but this initial infusion will help us accomplish the following: </p>
<p>-Upgrade
the existing product and create an Internet-based subscription service with back-office support and structure (8-11 months) (45% )</p>
<p>-Complete
Phase I of the Serious-Game: currently includes completion of game design,

This isn't easy for me to say.</p><p>Some of you guys know this, but I have had a rough last few years. I obviously have some issues from combat like we all do but it got to the point where I was about to be homeless. At one point I was sitting on my couch with a gun to my head and the only thing that stopped me is my dogs picked up on it and started to lick me. My dogs brought me back just long enough to realize I had a responsibility to my wife, my brothers, my family, and to them and how jacked up it would be to check out and leave them to deal with the mess. My dogs saved my life. Things didn't get better though. I was still about to be homeless. Taking the gun away from my head didn't put money in my pocket. I could get work but not a steady job. I started selling everything I owned to pay my rent, my bills, and my child support. I sold everything I had to include my guns. I don't want to get too into details just to keep this from being a book, but the bottom line is I sold guns to the wrong person, and they shipped them to China. He eventually got caught, set me up in a sting trying to save his own ass and I went to federal prison for international arms trafficking. I plead out to 5 years but my judge saw that I was salvageable. He took my record into consideration, as well as the circumstances I was in and gave me two years. I just got out in February.</p><p>So this weekend I did this personal development course called Landmark Forum. Its a transformational program to help people get over their past and do what they want to do. I went into it thinking I could get some tips to help me get through school and into my career. A lot of stuff came out though.</p><p>This weekend a lot of the anger and guilt I carry with me came out and I stood up and told 120 of the other people in the class how much I hated them for thanking me for my service and how they are stupid sheep and don't have our back. I went into gory detail of one of the incidents where I saw one of my brothers blown apart in front of me. I blamed them for our brothers killing themselves for their lack of understanding and for letting the system get away with not helping the guys who need it. All this anger came out and I realized it was just my story, not what happened. I am attaching all these things to what happened. I was able to breakthrough all that stuff with the guy leading it. I am a new person, my wife was blown away last night when I got home, she has never seen me so happy. I committed myself to getting combat guys to come to the forum so they can have their own breakthroughs. I had no idea how I was going to make it happen considering its between $545 and $575 to come to the course but I knew I needed to get guys there.</p><p>A lot of people came up to me after I shared all this. People just started handing me money to pay for guys to come. Other people started handing me their business cards and said they would pay/sponsor any veteran to come to the course. The leader of the course said if I could organize a course for just combat vets he would come lead it on his time off. All this stuff just started falling into place.</p><p>I am not selling anything. This isn't some cult or religious organization. This isn't motivational seminars or brainwashing.

Hi, I’m Asia Tallino, a fourth year student at UC Berkeley

Since I've been here, my mind has been blown uncountable times, but what has really resonated with me, and has become my passion & life-purpose, is food.

PERCHE' UNA RACCOLTA FONDI?Perché la scuola, nonostante abbia sempre mostrato interesse alla nostra proposta, ha pochi soldi da investire in progetti di questo tipo, mentre noi abbiamo un'immensa voglia di offrire ai ragazzi questa opportunità di scoprire un nuovo modo di vedere le cose tramite un mezzo creativo e divertente.Un modo diverso di vedere se stessi e di relazionarsi agli altri è possibile se vengono offerte le giuste chiavi di comprensione, a dispetto del senso di separazione ed isolamento che si insinuano sempre più ferocemente nei giovani a causa della mancanza di valori e fiducia.Sogno un pianeta basato sulla cooperazione per il bene di tutti, piuttosto che sulla competizione e l'egoismo.

Il risultato è che si dissolvono le apparenti separazioni, ritrovandoci a sorridere, ridere e creare musica coinvolgente assieme, in un'atmosfera gioiosa ed ideale per discutere e riconoscere valori cari all'armonia individuale e di gruppo.Personalmente amo il mio lavoro perché è soprendente ed unico vedere come il potere del suono ci riporti ad una naturale condizione di gioia ed unione oltre le apparenti differenze, riscoprendo una visione di sé e degli altri più consapevole ed amorevole.Con il Drum Circle facilitato portiamo un’iniezione di amicizia, intelligenza emozionale e vitalità nel mondo dei ragazzi, grazie al consolidato valore di questo metodo testato e dimostrato anche da alcune comunità scientifiche. (Il valore terapeutico dei tamburi & Impatto sul genoma e sistema immunitario)Nel processo di formazione di un'orchestra ritmica, le diversità diventano opportunità e risorse, piuttosto che elementi da temere.Inoltre esploriamo
 e sviluppiamo le nostre capacità espressive, comunicative e creative, 
raggiungendo importanti obiettivi sul piano individuale e relazionale. 
In particolare:

ourselves through the power of rhythm and sound, in
 an atmosphere that brings one another closer together, developing important qualities such as friendship, empathy, creativity and gruop harmony.While participants have fun in creating a real rhythmical orchestra, we help them to recognize and appreciate themselves and team spirit, remembering how creative they can be together for the good of everyone. This is our small gift we love sharing to the world!OUR PROJECT:After the success of my friend Harshil Filippo Chiostri with 'Drums for friendship', our intention is to achieve, with your help, a project needing € 3.500, which will help us to bring the benefits of drum circle at school, without having to depend on almost non-existent state funds.Our goal is to facilitate a rhythmic educational path of 10 meetings per class for a number of 80 students in Tuscany, which demonstrates that it is possible to create opportunities for deep promotion for:
a closer approach to themselves and their inner qualities;
a better cooperation and friendship amongst students;
a moving away from destructive lifestyles;
increased learning capacity, not only mental, but also of  emotional intelligence.
WHY A FUNDRAISER?Because school has no money to invest in this kind of projects, while we have a huge desire to offer this opportunity for a new way to see things through a funny and creative activity.A new way to see oneself and others is possible if the right keys of understanding are bound to be offered, in spite of the sense of separation and isolation which are creeping more and more amongst youths, due to the lack of values and trust.I dream a planet which is based on cooperation for the good of everyone, rather than competition and selfishness. Creating an environment in which this can be recognized and appreciated in early age means to put the foundation for a new society based on friendship and wellness.WHY RHYTHM AND MUSIC?The magic of the rythym and music overcomes all barriers of age, gender, religion, ideals and culture. The result is, that all apparent separation dissolves, and we find ourselves smiling, laughing and creating beautiful engaging music together!Personally, I love my job because it is amazing and unique to see how the power of rhythm and sound brings again ourselves to our natural state of joy and unity beyond apparent diversity. Thanks to this, we rediscover a more aware and loving vision of oneself and others.With facilitated Drum Circle we bring an injection of friendship , emotional intelligence and collaborative vitality in the world of youth, thanks to the well-established value of this method.During the formation of ""ensemble consciousness"" of the orchestra, differences become opportunities and resources, rather than elements to fear. In the project we explore and develop our communicative, expressive and creative abilities, reaching important objectives both on an individual basis and when relating to others. In particular:
Learning to feel the rythym.
Encouraging relaxation and facilitating the unlocking of emotional and psychophysical tensions.
Exploring and developing our capability of individual expression, overcoming shyness and fear of judgement.
Understanding and implementing basic rules in order to build a united group, in which they can then develop a sense of respect for themselves and the others within the group.
Developing listening and communication skills and cultural exchanges between students.
Use of the drum and rythym as a tool to express emotions and experiences within an open, accepting and playful atmosphere.
Opening and developing creative qualities.
Catching the magic of rythym and the circle.
HOW YOU CAN HELP!We need to raise € 3,500 to cover the costs of the project.For this we turn to our supporters, like you, and we ask you please to share it with your friends and family  so that together we can help to create new opportunities for a more harmonious society and respectful of the human being.You will help us to awaken the spirit of cooperation and friendship amongst the young , but also lets us to make the project visible and then spread throughout Italy.If we collect more funds than required, we will expand the project to more youth, to more schools , aiming to turn it into an educational model, integrated into the school curriculum!In return for your help we offer - in addition to the thanks - different types of reward, as you can see in the column to the right and further down on this page.I entrust you, please give us a hand, click on one of the options and share our project!  Thank you!HOW WE WILL USE YOUR DONATIONYour funds will be used to pay the costs of the project, namely:

<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
<p>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jules Tankel. I'm a member of the downtown Fort Wayne community, a part-time non-profit employee, a percussionist, a loving dog owner, and most recently in my life, I'm a professional hula hooper. I started my hoop journey around August of 2011 when I bought my first Hula Hoops from a neighbor’s garage sale (Thanks Pepper!). I immediately insisted that my friend Max learn with me. By the time September rolled around, we were hooked. In the winter of 2012, I purchased my fire hoop. This was around the same time that a few of my friends started spinning fire, and we got together with some people who had already played with fire before. After a few months, we started a fire and LED performance troupe, called Pyroscope Entertainment. Hooping is just one of many Flow Arts, and my fire family inspires me to keep working hard and honing my skills to become the best fire artist I can be. After our first paying gig, I had a moment of clarity. Never in my life would I ever had guessed that one day, I would be a professional fire performer. Since we started doing public performances around our community, I’ve had people approach me, wanting to learn to art of hoop dance. I have not taught official classes on hoop dance or hoop fitness, because I want to have the best resources available to make the most out of any potential student’s experience. I am ready to take the next step and begin my teacher training, but I cannot afford the daunting cost of certification and liability insurance. This is where you can help, and we can help each other!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I need from to make this happen is I need to pre-sell enough hoop classes so that I can pay for my teacher training. I’m also accepting donations, and gifts-in-kind. All pre-sold classes will be 20% off the normal class price! What you will be getting by purchasing a class or class pack now is a Gift Certificate redeemable for one hour classes once my teacher training has been completed. I’m offering certificates for single classes, and 8-packs of classes (8 classes for the price of 7!). Where and when will these classes be held? It’s hard to say a definitive time or place prior to the completion of my certification and my insurance. However, I do have a few locations already on board. My goal is to have my classes at a few different locations around the Fort Wayne area to reach out as many people as possible. As for Days/Times, Most classes will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the day, but I will offer night classes and weekend classes if there is interest. If you are not able to come to Fort Wayne for classes, please e-mail me (<a href=""mailto:julia.tankel@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">julia.tankel@gmail.com</a>) and see if we can work out a time or place that works for you.

<h3><strong>Why Hula Hooping?</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I want to raise awareness of how hula hooping can change your life. I am so grateful for everything hooping has done for me, and I want others to experience the same joy I do. It promotes healthy living, and it’s great for the body and the mind. I want to give the gift of hooping to our community!</p>
<p>I loved everything about hooping. I love the feeling of the hoop twirling around me. I love the bruises and “battle wounds” that come from spending countless hours perfecting a trick. I love that moment where everything else seems to fade away, and the only two things left in the world are you and your hoop. Most of all, I love how powerful, how healthy, and how strong I’ve become because of hula hooping. </p>

<h3>My Health Struggle, and How Hooping Helped</h3>
<p>I want everyone to feel as empowered and confident as I do in my hoop. Hula hooping saved my life. Yes, I hear how corny that sounds, but I really feel that in my case it’s true. I have a digestive condition, more specifically; I have a misshapen lower intestine. It’s a chronic condition that’s exacerbated by large amounts of stress, low-fiber diet, and lack of exercise. It causes me to have an extremely lowered appetite, lowered metabolism, and severe pains after eating. The only real options for me were to take fiber, eat healthier, and stay active. I started losing weight rapidly. At my lowest weight, I was 94 pounds. I felt weak and dizzy all the time. Then I started hula hooping. After just a few weeks, I had an appetite again. The new exercise boosted my metabolism, and I started gaining weight. The weight I gained back was healthy weight, muscle weight. Every day I grew stronger, and I continue to grow stronger still. Once I had been hooping for a month or so, I was back to a normal weight, but I was healthier than I had ever been before. For the first time in my life, I feel like I have complete command over my body. I am capable of anything now. I never would have described myself as an active or a fit person, never would I ever had guessed I’d be doing any sort of exercise for fun. Let alone on a daily basis. I hoop because I love everything about it. Now I want to share it with the world! </p>

</ul></div>","About the bookThis book will teach you the core concepts of neural networks and deep learning.  These are powerful machine learning techniques which have achieved outstanding results for problems in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.  Neural networks and deep learning are now being adopted by many companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.I'm writing this book to bridge the gap between popular accounts and the many technical papers on neural networks and deep learning. The book will make it easy and fun for people with programming and basic mathematical skills to come up to speed.I love explaining complex technical subjects.  I've written two previous books.  The first book, ""Quantum Computation and Quantum Information"" (joint with Ike Chuang), is the standard text on quantum computing, and one of the ten most cited books in the history of physics. The second book, ""Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science"", is a book for a general audience about networked science.  It was named one of the best books of 2011 by The Financial Times  and the Boston Globe.  In addition to my books I've written many technical articles, including ""Lisp as the Maxwell's equations of software"", ""How to crawl a quarter billion webpages in 40 hours"", and ""Why Bloom filters work the way they do"", all of which made the top five posts on Hacker News.You can see a draft of chapter 1 of the book at neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com.The book will be made freely available online, under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial license.As an independent writer and scientist, the reason I'm undertaking this Indiegogo campaign is to give me some partial support while I complete the book. Draft table of contents
Using neural nets to recognize handwritten digits: We get off to a flying start, creating a neural network that can solve a hard problem - recognizing handwritten digits.
Using backpropagation to speed up learning: We'll master the ins-and-outs of the backpropagation algorithm, which is the fundamental algorithm used to learn in neural nets, and the basis for deep learning.
Neural nets: the big picture:  How do artificial neural nets compare to biological brains? Is there a simple universal algorithm for thinking? How can we use neural nets to solve problems in speech recognition and natural language processing? Can we use neural nets to compute an arbitrary function?
Deep learning: What makes deep neural networks hard to train with conventional approaches?  How can we overcome those challenges? We'll see how deep neural nets can be pre-trained, and how they can learn high-level representations of knowledge from complex data.
Recent progress in image recognition: We'll dive into exciting recent work using deep learning to solve difficult problems in image recognition, including recognizing the images in ImageNet, and the Stanford-Google ""cat neuron"" paper.
The future of neural nets: Will neural nets help lead to artificial intelligence?  Can they be used to simulate a human brain?",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

 The more they train the more the want to train.  Then they start training younger boys and children and becoming positive role models, good examples and community leaders for positive, healthy change.  </p><p>The International Rugby Board has taken notice of what we are doing, as well as various UK based charities that use rugby as a tool for development in a similar way.  We've received

become the project of my life.  I have seen few projects take off with the same velocity as this one.  The more we accomplish the bigger the dream gets and the more I want to accomplish.  I want to maximize my individual impact in a positive way in Cape Verde by creating a sustainable project that one day I can walk away from and know it will continue running itself.  It's a long road still to

The Exo is a low-cost, durable, transportable and easy-to-assemble solution that can bring safety and security to suffering families.</p><p>I never intended for this to be a business, in fact I spent years trying to give the design away to government agencies and NGOs, but these organizations need private companies to develop products like these for them to use.

The World Health Organization has officially acknowledged that women are disproportionately affected by disasters: they are more likely to die, suffer from violence, and not get the adequate care they need to rebuild their lives.I witnessed this in my own country during the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. After three days of watching people crowd into the inhumane conditions of the New Orleans Superdome and Houston Astrodome (where families were separated from each other) I felt a call to action. I never thought that a styrofoam coffee cup would inspire the solution.But this cup was the perfect inspiration for a portable, secure, stackable shelter. I initially started building my rapid response emergency housing system in my backyard. The result of many years of design and prototyping is the Exo housing unit, unparalleled in the world of disaster relief solutions. The Exo is a low-cost, durable, transportable and easy-to-assemble solution that can bring safety and security to suffering families.I never intended for this to be a business, in fact I spent years trying to give the design away to government agencies and NGOs, but these organizations need private companies to develop products like these for them to use. Over the years, I have received so many requests from people around the world clamoring for this product, I decided to build Reaction - a company committed to revolutionizing the way the world responds to disasters.I've gathered a superhero team of designers and engineers obsessed by creating remarkable experience to solve challenging problems. Previously, our team has:
Been an integral part of Disney magic band design and development team
Designed homeland security structures certified and approved by the Department of Defense and NYPD
Built a wireless mesh platform to connect consumer devices used for elderly assisted living 
We’ve raised venture capital investment to set up operations. Now we want to bring our products to the masses. Realizing that we couldn’t possibly understand the needs of a displaced family from the confines of our studio, our team wants to get our Exo prototypes out of our workshop and into the lives of people who really need them. Through rapid prototyping and iteration, we’ll tweak the design so it can best meet the community’s needs.To do this, Reaction will partner with aid organizations around the world to deliver the Exo Housing System to families in need of shelter. The first pilots will be with select NGO's working with internally displaced persons in Syria and continued earthquake relief in Haiti.
The Maram Foundation was born of a desire to bring assistance to civilians blocked at the Syrian borders with neighboring countries after fleeing the violence that is devastating the country. Maram operates in Syria in a number of capacities:

managing a refugee camp
supporting field hospitals
organizing schools
providing facilities for aid workers
Aid by designYour donations will go towards the construction and delivery of Exo prototypes to families in need. These 80 sq-ft units can temporarily house a family of four, offering them shelter and safety until suitable long-term housing can be built.Unlike the infamous FEMA trailers that cost around $20,000 for a one time use, Exos can cost as little as 1/4 as much and can be set up in two minutes by hand, with no need for tools or heavy machinery.They’re reusable, durable and safe - thanks to these features:
Energy efficient doors and skylights for ample natural lighting
Digital door locks to keep housing secure and safe for women and children.
Aircraft-grade aluminum
Rugged composite skins
Insulated for climate control 
Capable of connecting to electricity, heat and air conditioning
Reaction is more than just individual units. In the aftermath of these disasters, mothers and children can be easily separated and whole familiescan be divided. After Hurricane Katrina, many of us remember the images of fathers and mothers roaming the Superdome and Astrodome with cardboard signs looking for their families. With this in mind, because of its size and transportability, we have designed Exos to be deployed in small pods, like a safe neighborhood or a familiar community.Exos are wired for electricity and connectivity - so the units can be lit at night and parents can charge mobile phones to remain in touch within the family and with the broader community. The Exo units themselves form a wireless mesh network, recognizing the units around them and connecting to a single digital platform. Through one dashboard, aid organizations can monitor entire fleets of Exos to see which units are online, offline or in transit, while also monitoring for temperature or fire.Join the movementWomen are often excluded from having a say in restoration and reconstruction efforts after disasters. In the process of providing housing for these families, we want them to inform how the product is designed in order to meet their needs in the future.  When we deliver Exo Beta units, our team will work with the aid organizations deploying them and engage with the families using the shelters, so we can better understand their unique needs and design explicitly for them. Through rapid-iteration, we’ll incorporate this feedback for the next generation of products to provide shelter to millions in the years to come.For every $10,000 we raise we will ship a housing unit to an additional family in need around the world. We have set a humble initial goal of $50,000 to house five families at no cost to the families or aid organizations working with them. Selected PerksAll contributing participants at all levels will receive an exclusive login to our Disaster Response portal, where they will be able to track the delivery of Exo housing units throughout the world as part of this campaign and other partnerships with global aid organizations.Reaction Exo T-shirtReaction Disaster Response Team T-shirts (3 Designs):3D Printed Exo (3 color options)An Exo for you or a family in need (standard configuration)Thank you...Thanks for supporting a company that believes that thoughtful design can address resource challenges and provide a safe place for families after disaster. Help us tackle the problem of 32.5 million new people every year in need of rapid emergency response housing.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I was not supposed to be here. Haitian society determines

<p>As for myself and most young Haitians from the masses,

refuge in drugs, gangs, prostitution and other form of corruption.</p>
<p>To
solve this problem, IMPACT will provide financial literacy and entrepreneurship
education in addition to the curriculum of two disadvantaged high schools
where having a library, good books, good teachers, and computers is still a
fantasy. The goal is to reach 100 enthusiastic students with workshops,
including Introduction to Entrepreneurship, Budgeting &amp; Saving and
Communication &amp; Networking. From this training they acquire the necessary
tools to start a small economic activity and networking to find a mentor. The
project will commence in two sister cities, Kenscoff and Pétion-Ville, located

<p>
</p><p>1. Learn to read and write English
quickly and easily without having to learn how to spell</p>
<p>2. Pronounce all English words
correctly without memorization</p>
<p>3. Look up the meanings of unfamiliar

<p>4. <b>Achieve perfect spelling without

<p>
</p><p>Now that most text is electronic, the
time has come to tackle the problem of English spelling—by
auto­mating it. The ubiquitous use of spell-checkers is a
relatively tiny step in the right direction: at least we know that
the words we type actually exist. Unspell will take us the rest of
the way: it will tell us how to pronounce each word correctly, and
how to spell it correctly as well. Most importantly, it will allow us
to avoid having to learn English spelling, saving a lot of time and

<p>
</p><p>There are two apps, one called <b>unspell</b>,

The first app takes English text and, quite literally, “unspells”
it, rendering it phonetically using a special set of phonetic

gets confused (by spellings such as “tear” and “bow,” which
are ambiguous), it prompts you to pick the correct pronunciation. The
other app, <b>respell</b>,
takes unspelled English and respells it back to English text. When it
gets confused—do you mean “ewe” (sheep) or “yew” (tree)?—
<b>respell</b> prompts you to
pick the correct spelling, based on its intended meaning. Here's how
it works:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/206704/files/20131118103258-unspellRespell.png?1384799578"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>
English spelling poses a huge
impediment to learning. Functional illiteracy rates in
English-speaking countries run as high as 40%. English orthography
was haphazard to start with; then, in the 18th century,
the spellings of English words were fixed for all time, mistakes
included. Since then, spoken English has evolved, but written English
hasn't.</p>

In the U.S., children spend eight years 
memorizing the spellings of words to achieve basic competence in written
 English. But eighth-grade-level reading and writing skills are too 
limited for most practical uses, such as understanding law, science, 
medicine, technology or commerce. In contrast, schoolchildren in 
countries where the national language has a regular, consistent 
orthography achieve adequate literacy in just a year or two, by 
memorizing a small set of rules, and are then free to learn other 
things. It is little wonder that many of these countries are surging 
ahead while English-speaking countries are falling behind. Unspell can 
level the playing field.<p>Unspell is designed to benefit the
following categories of people:
</p><p>
</p><ul><li>
<p>The many adult illiterates and
	semi-literates who speak English fluently but who, for one reason or
	another, never learned to read and write well enough to be able to
	enjoy reading. They can learn to read Unspell by taking a brief
	on-line course. This will allow them to start reading any materials
	which they can understand when they are read to them.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<p>Special needs students who,
	because of various learning difficulties, are unable to learn
	English spelling. Unspell uses simple, easily distinguished, easy to
	draw shapes which were specifically designed with them in mind.
	Unspell avoids the use of flipped, mirrored or rotated shapes that
	give so much trouble to dyslexics, such as p/q/d/b, u/n, y/h, w/m
	and s/z.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<p>Home-schooled kids whose parents
	are pressed for time and want to get them reading anything from
	books on farming and animal care to masterpieces of world literature
	on their own quickly and without a lot of coaching.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<p>ESOL students who currently have
	to face the hurdle of learning English spelling even though
	everything they need to read is available in their native language
	and the English skills they need are primarily oral.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<p>Professionals around the world who
	already know how to work with written English. Many of them, being
	pressed for time, have never learned how to pronounce many of the
	words they use. They then find themselves having to participate in
	discussions or give talks in English. Unspell can make them sound
	polished with minimal effort.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<p>English native speakers who would
	like to improve how they sound and lose their class or regional
	dialect in order to better integrate into society. By reading in
	Unspell, they will be absorbing one of the prestige dialects:
	Standard American English or British Received Pronunciation of news
	broadcasters, Hollywood actors and Masterpiece Theatre.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<p>English native speakers who are
	not entirely comfortable working with written English, especially
	when it comes to spelling. A spell-checker can tell them whether
	something is a word, but it can't tell them whether it is the right
	word. Unspell can let them capture the meaning, and then they can
	use the <b>respell</b> app,
	which will spell most of the document automatically and guide them
	in choosing the correct spellings of words where necessary.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<p>People with impaired vision whose
	eyes are strained by reading regular English text. The symbols of
	Unspell are specifically designed to reduce eyestrain.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<p>Anyone who has ever made a fool of
	themselves by not knowing how to pronounce a word or a name, or by
	pronouncing it incorrectly.</p>

countries where the national language has a regular, consistent 
orthography achieve adequate literacy in just a year or two, by 
memorizing a small set of rules, and are then free to learn other 
things. It is little wonder that many of these countries are surging 
ahead while English-speaking countries are falling behind. Unspell can 
level the playing field.Unspell is designed to benefit the
following categories of people:


The many adult illiterates and
	semi-literates who speak English fluently but who, for one reason or
	another, never learned to read and write well enough to be able to
	enjoy reading. They can learn to read Unspell by taking a brief
	on-line course. This will allow them to start reading any materials
	which they can understand when they are read to them.

Special needs students who,
	because of various learning difficulties, are unable to learn
	English spelling. Unspell uses simple, easily distinguished, easy to
	draw shapes which were specifically designed with them in mind.
	Unspell avoids the use of flipped, mirrored or rotated shapes that
	give so much trouble to dyslexics, such as p/q/d/b, u/n, y/h, w/m
	and s/z.

Home-schooled kids whose parents
	are pressed for time and want to get them reading anything from
	books on farming and animal care to masterpieces of world literature
	on their own quickly and without a lot of coaching.

ESOL students who currently have
	to face the hurdle of learning English spelling even though
	everything they need to read is available in their native language
	and the English skills they need are primarily oral.

Professionals around the world who
	already know how to work with written English. Many of them, being
	pressed for time, have never learned how to pronounce many of the
	words they use. They then find themselves having to participate in
	discussions or give talks in English. Unspell can make them sound
	polished with minimal effort.

English native speakers who would
	like to improve how they sound and lose their class or regional
	dialect in order to better integrate into society. By reading in
	Unspell, they will be absorbing one of the prestige dialects:
	Standard American English or British Received Pronunciation of news
	broadcasters, Hollywood actors and Masterpiece Theatre.

English native speakers who are
	not entirely comfortable working with written English, especially
	when it comes to spelling. A spell-checker can tell them whether
	something is a word, but it can't tell them whether it is the right
	word. Unspell can let them capture the meaning, and then they can
	use the respell app,
	which will spell most of the document automatically and guide them
	in choosing the correct spellings of words where necessary.

People with impaired vision whose
	eyes are strained by reading regular English text. The symbols of
	Unspell are specifically designed to reduce eyestrain.

Anyone who has ever made a fool of
	themselves by not knowing how to pronounce a word or a name, or by
	pronouncing it incorrectly.

</div>","Our Story 

The Kris Anderson Connexions Youth Forum aims to address gender inequality
within the film industry by offering female filmmakers, between the ages of 19
and 25, skills training, mentorship, hands-on experience and an all-access pass
to the DOXA Documentary Film Festival.
This year DOXA is looking to the IndieGoGo community to
raise funds to grow this unique youth program. Your donations will directly
help aspiring filmmakers participate in all aspects of the 2012 DOXA
Documentary Film Festival in May. With the support of the National Film Board of Canada and other partners the Connexions program offers a unique festival experience. During the 14-day intensive program,
participants work with mentors to create their own documentary films and screen them at a gala festival event. Other program highlights include:

Workshops that focus on the art of documentary storytelling
using digital media

Mentorship from established film professionals

Networking sessions with organizations such as the National
Film Board of Canada, Knowledge Network and other film production companies

Opportunity to attend private receptions and exclusive
events at DOXA 2012


 
""The DOXA Connexions program exceeded all my expectations.
The warmth, generosity and support shown by our mentors, the NFB and the DOXA
team really made us young filmmakers feel important, which is rare. I feel so
charged to continue telling stories that will help make change in this world.
Thank you for believing in us."" -- Su-An Ng, 2010 Connexions Youth Forum
participant
 
""The Connexions youth this year rocked - again! Our NFB
studio here in Vancouver sure enjoyed getting to know these emerging female
directors, and watching their talents unfurl over the course of the intensive
filmmaking workshops. Their enthusiasm was infectious, for both DOXA and NFB,
but also for the pure love of cinema."" -- Tracey Friesen, Executive Producer,
National Film Board of Canada, Pacific & Yukon Centre
 
Impact
It's simple: By raising $3000 we will be able to offer more
workshops to more participants.
At a time when government is cutting back funding for the
arts, our goal is grow the Connexions Youth Forum by offering a greater
diversity of workshops to more youth participants.
Funds will help to:

Bring in young women from rural or Northern BC

Offer cutting edge workshops in animation and 3D technology

Bring in established industry professionals for mentorship
and guidance


 
 
What We Need
$200  pays for a workshop with a film industry
professional 
$500  helps provide current technology, giving
participants more hands on experience
$1500 sponsors an additional Connexions participant

 We don’t want this email to get too long so if you’re interested in learning more about Phaedrus you can read about us on these sites…There is a blog post about us on the website of Sugata Mitra, the 2013 TED Prize winner…https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/updates/podgorica-s-got-sole-by-haden-wareAnd you can get some information and watch a video about Phaedrus on our website here…www.phaedrus-centar.meThe center is a nonprofit which is completely free of charge for the children that use it.  So far we have been funding it ourselves but it has become too large a load for us to carry on our own and so we are humbly asking for your help.  We are trying to raise enough funds to pay for the costs of the center in Montenegro and once this is covered we will begin the process of opening a sister center in Buenos Aires Argentina.  It os our dream to have hundreds of Phaedrus centers scattered throughout the developing world.  But for this dream to come true, we need your help.If you have some spare change and feel that our project is worthy of your generosity we would be so grateful if you could make a donation.If you don’t have the extra money to give but still want to support what we are doing it would be great if you could visit our Facebook page, like us, and maybe spread the word around to your other friends…https://www.facebook.com/PhaedrusMNEWe have never been more excited about any project we have worked on than we are about Phaedrus.  It has been the most rewarding experience of our life and we hope to be able to continue doing this work and hopefully bring Phaedrus to numerous countries throughout the world.  It’s an ambitious dream but we know we can get there if we just continue to put one foot in front of the other and with all of your help and support we know we can take that first big step!Thank you all.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Randee Nicolay and I am enthusiastic, outgoing and committed to helping others-- A “Jack of all trades…master of none” kind of gal, EXCEPT for when it comes to building people up.  My mission is to reach out, empower, inform and encourage kids to push forward. As a first generation college student, I joined AmeriCorps to serve at-risk youth and help them navigate post-secondary education options. It was there that I developed an affinity for financial aid in its entirety. I have been fortunate enough to work with youth and adults of various cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds in Oregon’s public school system for several years now.

<p><em>Now</em>, I’d like to share with you my recreational hope and desire. Theater—the underbelly of any institution of learning. (That’ll chap the hide of a thespian or two…) This specific theater opportunity is unique in that the best and brightest aspiring performers come together to achieve laughter.  Laughter is fundamental; it’s a tremendous equalizer and it amplifies our universal connection. We all laugh in the same language. The formal training I will receive through this program will act as a catalyst in developing my comedic strengths and career.</p>
<p>The theater in mention is The Groundlings, an improvisational theater and school located in West Hollywood California. The school itself has been the foremost comedy training ground in Hollywood since 1974 and some noteworthy Alumni (to name a few) include Phil Hartman, Cheryl Hines, Will Ferrel, Lisa Kudrow, Chris Kattan and Pat Morita. It is an innovative and challenging program that sets the standard in improvisation and sketch comedy. Admittance into the program is by audition only and the core program is comprised of four instruction levels-- all geared toward professional actors. After having passed the extension courses that serve as the prerequisites into the basic program, as well as auditioning for and being accepted into the professional Groundlings course of study in November, the next step in my journey is to migrate south for the summer months to further develop the nature of my craft.</p>
<p><strong>I am seeking out tuition assistance in the amount of $1,000 for a 12 week professional technique program, as this non-traditional learning experience does not qualify for traditional financial aid assistance. Give a few cents or a dollar! Every little bit helps!</strong></p>

<strong>Music and Voice Institute (MVI)</strong> ...</h3>
<p>is a non-profit Music Academy in Banning and Beaumont California. Incorporated in 2011 MVI was created by parents and musicians to provide quality music education to our community. Our goal is to provide students  the opportunity to enhance their education and increase their ability to obtain higher education through scholarships at major universities. Our well trained and highly credentialed staff is dedicated to help each student.</p>
<p>Our <strong>AFTER-SCHOOL Music program</strong> is unique. It includes everything the student will need to learn to play an instrument. A major hurdle to a income-challenged community is having the ability for a family to rent an instrument. This becomes an insurmountable obstacle for most income-challenged families. Our innovative program includes a professional instructor and the instrument as part of our comprehensive package. The instruments we purchase will enable students to study at home. Not only will we fill-in the void created by ever shrinking school district budgets but we will create performing ensembles and other performance avenues. </p>

for more freedoms and human rights. Because China will not allow western media
into Tibetan areas it is hard to ascertain how many Tibetans have been killed, but, as CCP soldiers and police have flooded into Tibet, human
rights and Tibetan advocacy groups fear the worst.</span></font>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Students for a  Free Tibet (SFT) works in solidarity with the Tibetan 
people in their  struggle for freedom and independence. We are a 
chapter-based network of  young people and activists around the world. 
Through education,  grassroots organizing, and non-violent direct 
action, we campaign for  Tibetansâ€™ fundamental right to political

</div></div>","Our Story

               The Chinese
government is using deadly force to respond to the calls of Tibetans in Tibet
for more freedoms and human rights. Because China will not allow western media
into Tibetan areas it is hard to ascertain how many Tibetans have been killed, but, as CCP soldiers and police have flooded into Tibet, human
rights and Tibetan advocacy groups fear the worst.
Amid this
atmosphere of rebellion and oppression, young Tibetans have begun to,
literally, set themselves on fire as a last resort form of protest. At last
count, 25 Tibetans have set fire to themselves in eastern Tibet; twelve since 6 January 2012. At least 18 have died. The young men and women,
usually Buddhist monks and nuns, who committed these desperate acts called for
freedom in Tibet and the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet while flames
engulfed them.
This campaign is being launched on March 10, 2012 to help commemorate Tibetan National Uprising Day. All over the world, Tibetans and Tibet supporters will take to the streets to raise awareness of the situation in Tibet and send a clear message to the Chinese government: Despite all of your violence and oppression the Tibetan people and their supporters will not give up. End the violence in Tibet; end oppression in Tibet. Tibet will be free.

The Impact

Students for a  Free Tibet (SFT) works in solidarity with the Tibetan 
people in their  struggle for freedom and independence. We are a 
chapter-based network of  young people and activists around the world. 
Through education,  grassroots organizing, and non-violent direct 
action, we campaign for  Tibetansâ€™ fundamental right to political 
freedom. Our role is to empower  and train youth as leaders in the 
worldwide movement for social  justice.

The work SFT is effective and translates into real and positive change in Chinese occupied Tibet.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Last year I left my job in social media advertising to return to full time studies at Ryerson University (while working part time). I am in the Graphic Communications Management Program and will graduate with a Bachelor of Technology. Obviously school is really expensive and so is life. I work, I freelance, I do doors at shows / run events when I can. I clip coupons and I cut back and try to cut costs where I can. I just want to be able to pay my tuition and not feel like I am either going to starve, go homeless/have to move 1.5 hours away from school, have to sell my things, or not be able to remain in school. So help me be able to be a person and be awesome at life by kicking ass at school. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for $5000 ... my tuition is actually closer to 7 grand. However I will honestly take any help. I hate asking but times are tough. <br/><br/>If you help I will bake you things.

<p><em>Español: Hola, por favor ve abajo para leer mi historia y proposito en espanol. </em></p>
<h3><em><strong>I'm happy to announce that thanks to your requests, I'm launching a Part II fundraiser.  In our orginal fundraiser, we raised over $3,230!  Let's see if we can raise $570 for Part II to total $3,800! </strong></em></h3>
<p><strong><em>----</em></strong></p>
<p>My name is Freddie and I know that together you and I will make an incredible impact on children’s education.  With your commitment to help me raise the funds, I promise to create and run the first ever San Rafael-Huejucar Marathon (26.2 miles) individually.  All the funds will go to helping a special small rural elementary school. The funds will go a long way, from getting computers to buying much needed teaching materials, to repairing and fixing the school itself. </p>
<p><strong>Who I am &amp; Why it is Important</strong></p>
<p>Let me tell you about my purpose and why I am passionate about this cause. For the first 10 years of my life I grew up in the small rural town of San Rafael, Mexico, under very humble circumstances.  I attended Escuadron 201 Elementary School, the only school in our town, where I learned to read, write, and do math.  It was also there where I first fell in love with learning. I remember being 8 years old and already dreaming about going to college one day. But at 8 years old, I also knew that my dream would only remain a dream given my family and the town’s rather underprivileged circumstances.  As a kid living in such circumstances, the idea of going to college seemed unattainable. Interestingly enough, life gave me the incredible and unexpected opportunity to go after my dream and I can now tell you that I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of California-Irvine and Pepperdine University, respectively.</p>
<p>Escuadron 201 built my educational base and planted my dream to achieve higher education. Now it’s my turn to give back!  </p>
<p><strong>Children and Community</strong></p>
<p>San Rafael, located in the highlands of the state of Jalisco and the municipality of Huejucar, is a small agricultural town of a little over 110 people where people raise cattle and grow corn, beans, squash, etc.  San Rafael counts with only one school, Escuadron 201 Elementary School.  Currently, fewer than 20 energetic and diligent kids attend elementary school there.  And, while they are eager to learn, they are in need of many things to have the best education they could have. </p>
<p><strong>Your Impact</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely all the funds raised will go towards improving the education of the children of Escuadron 201 Elementary School in San Rafael, Huejucar, Mexico. </p>
<p>Escuadron 201 is in much need of funds for teaching materials and for infrastructure upgrades. The funds will be used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy 2 computers so that children learn basic computer skills.</li>
<li>Repair the walls of the schools that are in very poor condition. Then,</li>
<li>Repaint the entire school.</li>
<li>Buy much needed teaching materials on each subject (ex. microscopes, compasses, books, computer programs).</li>
<li>Buy basic classroom supplies (ex. pencils, crayons, notebooks, sharpeners, glue, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Charity</strong></p>
<p>The funds will be presented as part of the <strong>Arcelia Education Foundation</strong>, a foundation I’m in the process of establishing in honor my amazing mother who sacrificed a lot to have me achieve a good education. The purpose of this foundation is to help children in underprivileged and socio-economically disadvantaged circumstances to get a solid education.</p>
<p><strong>The Marathon</strong></p>
<p>I will be running what will be in essence the first ever San Rafael-Huejucar Marathon.  While and undergraduate student, I ran my first ever marathon to raise funds for a local charity and since then I’ve done six marathons. For years now, I’ve dreamt of returning to San Rafael and running a marathon there while raising funds for the children of Escuadron 201. The time is now.</p>
<p>Given that San Rafael is halfway between the towns of Huejucar and Monte Escobedo and, surprisingly, the distance between these two towns is a little over a marathon long (26.2 miles), I’ll be running that distance on my own! While marathons are generally difficult, the fact that I’ll be reaching 7,278 above sea level, I know it will be a difficult task. However, I know that with your encouragement and with the fact that this is an important cause for me personally, I will be successful.  </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help...</strong></p>
<p>Your donations are key but you can also help by spreading the word. Please share with your friends, family members, co-workers, organizations, etc. via email, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram, etc.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help.  Please donate as generously as you can.  Together we will have direct impact on the lives and futures of these children and their community.</p>

<h2><strong>Corro un maratón para la educación infantil de una escuela muy especial en México</strong></h2>
<p>Hola a todos! Mi nombre es Freddie y sé que juntos haremos un increíble impacto en la educación infantil. Con tu compromiso de ayudarme a recaudar más de 2.000 dólares EE.UU., yo me comprometo a crear y ejecutar el primer maratón (42.2 km) de San Rafael-Huejucar. Todos los fondos se destinarán a ayudar a una pequeña escuela primaria rural muy especial para mi. Los fondos contribuirán en gran medida para conseguir computadoras, para comprar material de enseñanza muy necesario, y para reparar la infrastructura de la propia escuela.</p>
<p><strong>Quién soy y por qué es importante</strong></p>
<p>Permítanme contarles acerca de mi propósito y por qué estoy muy apasionado por esta causa. Durante los primeros 10 años de mi vida, me crié en el pequeño pueblo rural de San Rafael, en México, en circunstancias muy humildes. Asistí a la Escuela Primaria Escuadrón 201, la única escuela en nuestro rancho/pueblo donde aprendí a leer, escribir y hacer matemática. Fue allí donde por primera vez me enamore del aprendizaje. Recuerdo que a los 8 años yo ya soñaba con ir a la universidad algún día. Sin embargo, a los 8 años de edad, también sabía que mi sueño seguiria siendo solo un sueño dado a las circunstancias bastante desfavorecidas de mi familia y de mi comunidad. Cuando era niño vivía en tales circunstancias que la idea de ir a la universidad parecía inalcanzable. Sorprendentemente, la vida me dio una oportunidad increíble e inesperada de perseguir mi sueño y ahora puedo contarles que obtuve mi licenciatura y maestría de la Universidad de California-Irvine y la Universidad de Pepperdine, respectivamente.</p>
<p>Escuadron 201 construyó mi base educativa y plantó mi sueño de alcanzar la educación superior. Ahora es mi turno de ayudar a las escuela y a los niños que ahora estan pasando por circunstancias similares a las que yo pasé!</p>
<p><strong>Los niños y la comunidad</strong></p>
<p>Mi pequeño San Rafael esta ubicado en la sierra del estado de Jalisco, en el municipio de Huejucar, Jalisco.  Es una pequeña población agrícola de poco más de 110 personas donde se cría ganado y se cultiva maíz, frijol, calabaza, etc. En San Rafael, se cuenta con una sola escuela, Escuela Primaria Escuadrón 201. En la actualidad, menos de 25 niños energéticos y diligentes asisten a la escuela primaria allí. Y, mientras ellos están ansiosos por aprender, están en necesidad de muchas cosas para tener la mejor educación posible.</p>
<p><strong>Tu Impacto</strong></p>

<p>Teniendo en cuenta que San Rafael está a medio camino entre las localidades de Monte Escobedo y Huejucar, y sorprendentemente, la distancia entre estas dos ciudades es un poco más de un maratón de largo (42.2 km), correré esa ruta.

I'm happy to announce that thanks to your requests, I'm launching a Part II fundraiser.  In our orginal fundraiser, we raised over $3,230!  Let's see if we can raise $570 for Part II to total $3,800! 
----
My name is Freddie and I know that together you and I will make an incredible impact on children’s education.  With your commitment to help me raise the funds, I promise to create and run the first ever San Rafael-Huejucar Marathon (26.2 miles) individually.  All the funds will go to helping a special small rural elementary school. The funds will go a long way, from getting computers to buying much needed teaching materials, to repairing and fixing the school itself. 
Who I am & Why it is Important
Let me tell you about my purpose and why I am passionate about this cause. For the first 10 years of my life I grew up in the small rural town of San Rafael, Mexico, under very humble circumstances.  I attended Escuadron 201 Elementary School, the only school in our town, where I learned to read, write, and do math.  It was also there where I first fell in love with learning. I remember being 8 years old and already dreaming about going to college one day. But at 8 years old, I also knew that my dream would only remain a dream given my family and the town’s rather underprivileged circumstances.  As a kid living in such circumstances, the idea of going to college seemed unattainable. Interestingly enough, life gave me the incredible and unexpected opportunity to go after my dream and I can now tell you that I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of California-Irvine and Pepperdine University, respectively.
Escuadron 201 built my educational base and planted my dream to achieve higher education. Now it’s my turn to give back!  
Children and Community
San Rafael, located in the highlands of the state of Jalisco and the municipality of Huejucar, is a small agricultural town of a little over 110 people where people raise cattle and grow corn, beans, squash, etc.  San Rafael counts with only one school, Escuadron 201 Elementary School.  Currently, fewer than 20 energetic and diligent kids attend elementary school there.  And, while they are eager to learn, they are in need of many things to have the best education they could have. 
Your Impact
Absolutely all the funds raised will go towards improving the education of the children of Escuadron 201 Elementary School in San Rafael, Huejucar, Mexico. 
Escuadron 201 is in much need of funds for teaching materials and for infrastructure upgrades. The funds will be used for the following purposes:

Buy 2 computers so that children learn basic computer skills.
Repair the walls of the schools that are in very poor condition. Then,
Repaint the entire school.
Buy much needed teaching materials on each subject (ex. microscopes, compasses, books, computer programs).
Buy basic classroom supplies (ex. pencils, crayons, notebooks, sharpeners, glue, etc.)

The Charity
The funds will be presented as part of the Arcelia Education Foundation, a foundation I’m in the process of establishing in honor my amazing mother who sacrificed a lot to have me achieve a good education. The purpose of this foundation is to help children in underprivileged and socio-economically disadvantaged circumstances to get a solid education.
The Marathon
I will be running what will be in essence the first ever San Rafael-Huejucar Marathon.  While and undergraduate student, I ran my first ever marathon to raise funds for a local charity and since then I’ve done six marathons. For years now, I’ve dreamt of returning to San Rafael and running a marathon there while raising funds for the children of Escuadron 201. The time is now.
Given that San Rafael is halfway between the towns of Huejucar and Monte Escobedo and, surprisingly, the distance between these two towns is a little over a marathon long (26.2 miles), I’ll be running that distance on my own! While marathons are generally difficult, the fact that I’ll be reaching 7,278 above sea level, I know it will be a difficult task. However, I know that with your encouragement and with the fact that this is an important cause for me personally, I will be successful.  
Other Ways You Can Help...
Your donations are key but you can also help by spreading the word. Please share with your friends, family members, co-workers, organizations, etc. via email, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram, etc.
Thank you so much for your help.  Please donate as generously as you can.  Together we will have direct impact on the lives and futures of these children and their community.
 
Corro un maratón para la educación infantil de una escuela muy especial en México
Hola a todos! Mi nombre es Freddie y sé que juntos haremos un increíble impacto en la educación infantil. Con tu compromiso de ayudarme a recaudar más de 2.000 dólares EE.UU., yo me comprometo a crear y ejecutar el primer maratón (42.2 km) de San Rafael-Huejucar. Todos los fondos se destinarán a ayudar a una pequeña escuela primaria rural muy especial para mi. Los fondos contribuirán en gran medida para conseguir computadoras, para comprar material de enseñanza muy necesario, y para reparar la infrastructura de la propia escuela.
Quién soy y por qué es importante
Permítanme contarles acerca de mi propósito y por qué estoy muy apasionado por esta causa. Durante los primeros 10 años de mi vida, me crié en el pequeño pueblo rural de San Rafael, en México, en circunstancias muy humildes. Asistí a la Escuela Primaria Escuadrón 201, la única escuela en nuestro rancho/pueblo donde aprendí a leer, escribir y hacer matemática. Fue allí donde por primera vez me enamore del aprendizaje. Recuerdo que a los 8 años yo ya soñaba con ir a la universidad algún día. Sin embargo, a los 8 años de edad, también sabía que mi sueño seguiria siendo solo un sueño dado a las circunstancias bastante desfavorecidas de mi familia y de mi comunidad. Cuando era niño vivía en tales circunstancias que la idea de ir a la universidad parecía inalcanzable. Sorprendentemente, la vida me dio una oportunidad increíble e inesperada de perseguir mi sueño y ahora puedo contarles que obtuve mi licenciatura y maestría de la Universidad de California-Irvine y la Universidad de Pepperdine, respectivamente.
Escuadron 201 construyó mi base educativa y plantó mi sueño de alcanzar la educación superior. Ahora es mi turno de ayudar a las escuela y a los niños que ahora estan pasando por circunstancias similares a las que yo pasé!
Los niños y la comunidad
Mi pequeño San Rafael esta ubicado en la sierra del estado de Jalisco, en el municipio de Huejucar, Jalisco.  Es una pequeña población agrícola de poco más de 110 personas donde se cría ganado y se cultiva maíz, frijol, calabaza, etc. En San Rafael, se cuenta con una sola escuela, Escuela Primaria Escuadrón 201. En la actualidad, menos de 25 niños energéticos y diligentes asisten a la escuela primaria allí. Y, mientras ellos están ansiosos por aprender, están en necesidad de muchas cosas para tener la mejor educación posible.
Tu Impacto
Absolutamente todos los fondos recaudados serán destinados a mejorar la educación de los niños de la Escuela Primaria Escuadrón 201 en San Rafael, Huejucar, Jalisco, México.
Escuadron 201 tiene la gran necesidad de fondos para los materiales de enseñanza y para mejorar la infraestructura. Los fondos se utilizaran para los fines siguientes:

Comprar 2 computadoras para que los niños aprenden habilidades básicas de computación.
Reparación de las paredes de la escuela que están en muy malas condiciones.
Pintar toda la escuela.
Comprar materiales de enseñanza para cada materia (ej. microscopios, brújulas, libros, programas informáticos, etc.).
Comprar materiales básicos (ej. lápices, crayones, cuadernos, sacapuntas, pegamento, etc.)

La  fundación
Los fondos se presentaran como parte de la Fundación de Educación Arcelia, una fundación que estoy en el proceso de establecer en honor a mi increible madre que sacrificó mucho para yo pudiera conseguir una buena educación. El objetivo de esta fundación es de ayudar a los niños en situaciones desfavorecidas y socio-económicamente en desventaja para obtener una educación sólida.
El maratón de San Rafael-Huejucar
Este maratón es único ya que nunca se ha corrido la ruta anteriormente. Cuando yo era estudiante de licenciatura , corrí mi primer maratón para recaudar fondos para una fundación local y desde entonces he hecho seis maratones en total.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The East Bay Solidarity Network is a volunteer organization that helps workers and tenants stand up against abusive bosses, landlords and banks.  A large part of what we do is to organize campaigns against wage theft, deposit theft, and other routine abuses that we face as working people. We also want to help organize our neighborhoods to prevent foreclosures and evictions. We are primarily based in West Oakland, which has been particularly hard-hit by the economic crisis and historically has been a site of displacement, gentrification, but also of fierce grassroots resistance. <br/></p>
<p>Our group is modeled off of the Seattle Solidarity Network (video above). We believe that working people and our communities are capable of solving our problems directly, without the use of expensive, ineffective and time-consuming lawyers and state bureaucracies. This model has proven to be highly effective in other similar organizations around the country, and we are excited to expand our work here in Oakland with the help of your donation!</p>
<p>Every day, people just like us are being robbed of their wages or their deposits, forced to live in shabby apartments and spend half their paychecks (or more) on rent, or pushed out of their own neighborhoods by skyrocketing rents, greedy developers and shady bank practices. Our organization is here to help each other stand up for our dignity and fight back to defend our jobs, our homes, our neighborhoods and our lives. But we need your help! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have set a goal of $1,000 to help us grow and strengthen the work of the East Bay Solidarity Network. This money will primarily go into printed materials like posters and flyers. One of the main ways people hear about our organization is through our posters which we put up all over town. Some other ways we use our funds (or have used them in the past): <br/></p>
<p>-Producing original materials, such as a booklet on the history of gentrification, evictions and resistance in West Oakland. <br/></p>
<p>-Throwing BBQ's for the neighborhood, which helps us meet new folks, find out what the problems are that people are facing, build up our membership and our relationships with our neighbors. <br/></p>
<p>-Sending organizers to build ties with people around the country. Last July we sent four organizers from Oakland to the first-ever ""International Solidarity Network Convergence"" in Seattle, where they got to meet and coordinate with other Solidarity Network organizers from around North America and beyond. </p>
<p>Whether or not we meet our goal, the funds we raise will be put back directly into the task of growing our organization and reaching out to workers and tenants in our community who are facing abuse and exploitation. As a scrappy, all-volunteer organization, we appreciate every donation we receive!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As the gap between the rich and the poor grows ever-wider, we feel it is crucial to develop new and more effective ways at defending our communities from the attacks of the 1%. The Solidarity Network is a concrete way that we can support each other against the abuse and exploitation we face on a day-to-day basis. Through winning tangible gains in our community, we are laying the groundwork for larger struggles aimed at structural change and creating a new and more just world. <br/></p>
<p>As we have seen from the successful track-record of groups in Seattle (over 35 successful campaigns in less than six years!), this model can be an inspiration for a new direction in social movement organizing. The Solidarity Network shows our community that we are capable of fighting back and winning simply by organizing each other, and using creative direct action to get what we want. <br/></p>

The name 'Libanon' is because our school was located in the Libanon street many years ago.</p><p>In the Netherlands we have a shortage op people with a technical education. In the last couple of years several initiatives were initiated to get children interested in higher technical education. Our project is one of them but we work closely with other initiatives.</p><p>7 years ago we started teaching robotics in our computer classes and found out a lot of children wanted to dig deeper and our first First Lego league team was born.</p><p>Today we have 6 FLL teams in competition. 5 of them are integrated in the regular schedule and there is our team, former known as 'Libanon Lego' but now called 'Dutch Delta'.</p><p>Team Dutch Delta is coached by volunteers and is currently FLL champion of the Netherlands.</p><p>Our main goal still is getting children interested in technical education and during the year our students and coaches give FLL demonstrations and Mindstorms workshops all over the country. All of them non-profit and for free.  </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What we need and wherefore:</h3><p>We want to raise money for 2 things:</p><p>First of all we are very proud of the technical skills our students have developed, but there's a financial downside as well. We are invited to participate the First Lego League world festival in St Louis USA, basically the FLL world championship.</p><p>
</p><p>As coaches we want our services to be free of charge, so
children can participate no matter what the financial situation of the parents
is.</p>
<p>Our goal is to travel to the US with 6 students and 2 adult
coaches. In total this will cost us 11960 euro.</p>
<p>This budget is built up as follows:</p>
<p>Airline tickets:  6560
euro<br/>
Reservation costs: 200 euro<br/>
Hotel: 3160 euro<br/>
Food and beverages: 1440 euro<br/>
Local transport: 600 euro</p>
<p>Total: 11960 euro</p>
<p>Second, there are the free workshops we offer.</p>
<p>In 2014 we will at least give one big workshop / FLL
demonstration during Legoworld (70.000 spectators).<br/>
In 2013 this 7 day event cost us 1750 euro.</p>
<p>Buying and replacing material (mindstorms kits) will cost us aprox 800
euro on a yearly base.</p>
<p>We have 3000 euro in cash and want to raise 10000 euro in
total.</p>
<p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>
</p><p>Donating will give us a chance to give this First Lego
League team the experience of participating the FLL World festival. For several
years these students are giving up loads of free time only to give other children
the chance of programming and learning robotics. It will be a well-deserved and
educational trip.</p>

</div>","Who are we?We are part of the Libanon Lyceum in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The name 'Libanon' is because our school was located in the Libanon street many years ago.In the Netherlands we have a shortage op people with a technical education. In the last couple of years several initiatives were initiated to get children interested in higher technical education. Our project is one of them but we work closely with other initiatives.7 years ago we started teaching robotics in our computer classes and found out a lot of children wanted to dig deeper and our first First Lego league team was born.Today we have 6 FLL teams in competition. 5 of them are integrated in the regular schedule and there is our team, former known as 'Libanon Lego' but now called 'Dutch Delta'.Team Dutch Delta is coached by volunteers and is currently FLL champion of the Netherlands.Our main goal still is getting children interested in technical education and during the year our students and coaches give FLL demonstrations and Mindstorms workshops all over the country. All of them non-profit and for free.  What we need and wherefore:We want to raise money for 2 things:First of all we are very proud of the technical skills our students have developed, but there's a financial downside as well. We are invited to participate the First Lego League world festival in St Louis USA, basically the FLL world championship.
As coaches we want our services to be free of charge, so
children can participate no matter what the financial situation of the parents
is.
Our goal is to travel to the US with 6 students and 2 adult
coaches. In total this will cost us 11960 euro.
This budget is built up as follows:
Airline tickets:  6560
euro
Reservation costs: 200 euro
Hotel: 3160 euro
Food and beverages: 1440 euro
Local transport: 600 euro
Total: 11960 euro
Second, there are the free workshops we offer.
In 2014 we will at least give one big workshop / FLL
demonstration during Legoworld (70.000 spectators).
In 2013 this 7 day event cost us 1750 euro.
Buying and replacing material (mindstorms kits) will cost us aprox 800
euro on a yearly base.
We have 3000 euro in cash and want to raise 10000 euro in
total.
The Impact
Donating will give us a chance to give this First Lego
League team the experience of participating the FLL World festival. For several
years these students are giving up loads of free time only to give other children
the chance of programming and learning robotics. It will be a well-deserved and
educational trip.
But more importantly, it will give us coaches and our
students the chance to continue our quest of showing children how interesting
the world of technics can be :)Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:
What you can do is join us in our quest. Find a local FLL team
to support, there are never enough coaches, or help starting up a new team on a

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>India has the largest free childcare system in the world.  The childcare centers, called anganwadis, are run by local women called anganwadi workers.  They are more than just childcare providers: they are political advocates who fight for the rights of the women and children in their communities.  Yet, they are  largely invisible. </p>
<p>In this project, Mathangi Subramanian (a former teacher and a Fulbright scholar) and Greeshma Patel (a professional photographer) are partnering to put cameras in the hands of anganwadi workers to document their stories.  </p>
<p>We will train the workers to use digital cameras during a six week workshop.  At the end, we will feature the photostories they produce in multiple venues, including a local art gallery (Thalam), an NGO-run blog, and our Facebook Page. We'll also share these photos with the Ministry of Women and Child Development to expose policymakers to what the workers believe needs to change.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contribution helps pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Six digital cameras that the workers will keep.</li>
<li>Installation costs in a gallery including printing, framing, and supplies.</li>
<li>Food and rental costs of the gallery, where we will hold the workshops.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will use whatever we earn to buy cameras.</p>
<p>In return, you're eligible to receive original artwork that comes out of the workshops, credit in the catalogue, and thank you postcards from the workers.  Plus, you'll get some great karma!</p>

<div>
<p>Here's why this project is so important to us: </p>
<p>First and foremost, we love these women.  They have incredible stories.  The world needs to hear them.</p>
<p>Policymakers need to know more about these women.  We have a good relationship with local government officials, so we're going to invite them to the events and share the photos with them. </p>
<p>The general public should know more about what anganwadis do.  That way they can help build political will to improve the conditions of women and children throughout India.</p>
<p>These women deserve the chance to express themselves publicly.  They give everything they have to their communities.  It's time they did something for themselves.</p>
<p>Here's why the two of us are the best people for the project:</p>
<p>Mathangi has a decade of experience teaching and training, and she's run digital storytelling workshops with everyone from teachers to formerly incarcerated youth to private school going third graders. She's spent the past seven month researching anganwadis in India.  </p>

<p>If I got the privilege to go to Italy, I would be forever grateful.  During our stay there, we will explore Venice with a guide; see churches, baptistries, and art in Florence; explore San Gimignano; travel a high speed train from to Naples and continue on to Sorrento; visit and take a tour Pompeii and the island of Capri; drive to Rome and visit forums, arches, and the colosseum; and visit the Vatican museum, Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter's Basilica.  All of these sound like amazing activities that I would absolutely love to experience.  </p>

More than 30 years ago, I read a book that dramatically changed my life and shook the entire world with its controversial theses about early Christianity, Jesus, Mary Magdalene and the implications of these hot button ideas. The book, </strong><strong><em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail, </em></strong><strong>and all subsequent books, articles and films on the subject matter have come as a result of one man's discoveries and keen eye for coded messages.  That man is Henry Lincoln.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Now, Mr. Lincoln’s extensive archives will be made available to all those who are interested to see them. In addition, we desire to document on film the ""re-discoveries"" by Henry as he goes through 'treasure' boxes that haven't been opened in decades and his thoughts and recollections as the archive team goes through each document, each photograph, each manuscript, each letter and each note in order to organize and share with researchers now and to come.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>In 1982 the publication of <em>HBHG</em> was to have a profound effect upon modern attitudes and thinking. The<em> International Herald Tribune </em>said:<em> “To call </em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail <em>controversial would be an understatement … The book’s contentions have met a religious fire storm.“ </em>Hundreds of books have since been written, attempting to demolish – or to support – the hypothesis put forward in its pages. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What had begun ten years earlier in a BBC documentary film’s attempt to unravel a little local mystery in the foothills of the French Pyrenees has now spawned an industry. Films have been made, novels written and fantasies concocted in its wake. But genuine, provable and astonishing discoveries have been made. Discoveries which shed an unexpected and startling new light upon the history of our Western Civilisation.</strong><br/><br/><strong>From its inception, one man has been intimately involved in the extraordinary research which has led to changes in the world’s thinking about Christianity, the role of women and … even more importantly … the realization that we have much still to learn about the beliefs, the knowledge and the skills of our remote ancestors.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Now in his ninth decade, the necessity to preserve Henry Lincoln’s archive has become a priority. </strong><br/><br/><strong>Documents, photographs, recordings, books, films, diagrams, scripts, maps and manuscripts demonstrate the growth of the hypotheses and the many detours and stumbling blocks, which have led to new ideas and new attitudes. Future scholars will find that the contents of this archive can help in the understanding of many of the changes in society, which came in the second half of the twentieth century. </strong><br/><br/><strong>Whether Henry Lincoln’s arguments are accepted … or not … their effect has been undeniable.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>This is what Lincoln had to say about the archive project:</strong></p>
<p> <em>Why does this archive matter to me ?    More importantly – why does it matter at all?   </em></p>
<p><em>I did not set out to produce this body of work.   I was not trying to find a subject which would give me a ‘best-seller’.   I was simply an actor/cum writer who stumbled upon an exciting yarn, which might have the makings of a brief television programme.   It was simply “part of the job” … just one more script to help with paying the bills.   When I began to research the story, I thought that the subject would be written, filmed, seen and forgotten within the year.  But Rennes-le-Château was bigger than that … bigger than I had imagined … and bigger than most people yet realise.</em><em><br/></em><em> <br/></em><em>Throughout the years of struggling to understand, of confronting the distortions of “History” as it was being taught, of being shocked by the discoveries which I was making, I was constantly amazed by the hostility which I encountered among those in the academic world.   I was an ‘outsider’ and so had no place in their self-satisfied society.  The ‘biblical’ distortions of the theological community were easier to comprehend and to accept.   After all, here I was confronting ‘Faith’.   And it is not easy to question long-held beliefs.  But what I found truly shocking was the dishonesty which I encountered in the media.   ...  But when a supposedly respectable journal began to peddle patent untruths, I realised that Rennes-le-Château was touching nerves in an establishment of which I had no desire to be part.</em><em><br/><br/></em><em>And so, for the last thirty years, I have been content to plough my own furrow and to ignore the opinions of those who – at the most generous – were speaking from a position of wilfully blinkered and self-imposed ignorance.</em><em><br/><br/></em><em>So – why should my archive matter ?     It matters because it will demonstrate a Truth.   Not simply the truth of what I have discovered – but also, I hope, the honesty which I have tried to bring to the work.   </em><em><br/><br/></em><em>I am humbled by what I have learned of our forebears’ genius.  And this I wish to share.  It is for others with the requisite skills and expertise to go where I lack the knowledge to follow.  My archive will save them time.   </em></p>

<p> <strong>As a researcher and huge Henry Lincoln fan, </strong><strong>I'm more than honored to be a part of this project to organize, protect and preserve the extensive archives of author and documentarian Henry Lincoln whose work has had such a profound sociological impact.

<p><strong>Thanks so much for your interest and support for this very important project which will carry on far into the future!  - <em>René Barnett</em></strong></p></div>","I'm René Barnett, a tv/filmmaker, radio host and researcher in Los Angeles. More than 30 years ago, I read a book that dramatically changed my life and shook the entire world with its controversial theses about early Christianity, Jesus, Mary Magdalene and the implications of these hot button ideas. The book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and all subsequent books, articles and films on the subject matter have come as a result of one man's discoveries and keen eye for coded messages.  That man is Henry Lincoln.
 Now, Mr. Lincoln’s extensive archives will be made available to all those who are interested to see them. In addition, we desire to document on film the ""re-discoveries"" by Henry as he goes through 'treasure' boxes that haven't been opened in decades and his thoughts and recollections as the archive team goes through each document, each photograph, each manuscript, each letter and each note in order to organize and share with researchers now and to come.
 In 1982 the publication of HBHG was to have a profound effect upon modern attitudes and thinking. The International Herald Tribune said: “To call Holy Blood, Holy Grail controversial would be an understatement … The book’s contentions have met a religious fire storm.“ Hundreds of books have since been written, attempting to demolish – or to support – the hypothesis put forward in its pages. 
What had begun ten years earlier in a BBC documentary film’s attempt to unravel a little local mystery in the foothills of the French Pyrenees has now spawned an industry. Films have been made, novels written and fantasies concocted in its wake. But genuine, provable and astonishing discoveries have been made. Discoveries which shed an unexpected and startling new light upon the history of our Western Civilisation.From its inception, one man has been intimately involved in the extraordinary research which has led to changes in the world’s thinking about Christianity, the role of women and … even more importantly … the realization that we have much still to learn about the beliefs, the knowledge and the skills of our remote ancestors.Now in his ninth decade, the necessity to preserve Henry Lincoln’s archive has become a priority. Documents, photographs, recordings, books, films, diagrams, scripts, maps and manuscripts demonstrate the growth of the hypotheses and the many detours and stumbling blocks, which have led to new ideas and new attitudes. Future scholars will find that the contents of this archive can help in the understanding of many of the changes in society, which came in the second half of the twentieth century. Whether Henry Lincoln’s arguments are accepted … or not … their effect has been undeniable.
 This is what Lincoln had to say about the archive project:
 Why does this archive matter to me ?    More importantly – why does it matter at all?   
I did not set out to produce this body of work.   I was not trying to find a subject which would give me a ‘best-seller’.   I was simply an actor/cum writer who stumbled upon an exciting yarn, which might have the makings of a brief television programme.   It was simply “part of the job” … just one more script to help with paying the bills.   When I began to research the story, I thought that the subject would be written, filmed, seen and forgotten within the year.  But Rennes-le-Château was bigger than that … bigger than I had imagined … and bigger than most people yet realise. Throughout the years of struggling to understand, of confronting the distortions of “History” as it was being taught, of being shocked by the discoveries which I was making, I was constantly amazed by the hostility which I encountered among those in the academic world.   I was an ‘outsider’ and so had no place in their self-satisfied society.  The ‘biblical’ distortions of the theological community were easier to comprehend and to accept.   After all, here I was confronting ‘Faith’.   And it is not easy to question long-held beliefs.  But what I found truly shocking was the dishonesty which I encountered in the media.   ...  But when a supposedly respectable journal began to peddle patent untruths, I realised that Rennes-le-Château was touching nerves in an establishment of which I had no desire to be part.And so, for the last thirty years, I have been content to plough my own furrow and to ignore the opinions of those who – at the most generous – were speaking from a position of wilfully blinkered and self-imposed ignorance.So – why should my archive matter ?     It matters because it will demonstrate a Truth.   Not simply the truth of what I have discovered – but also, I hope, the honesty which I have tried to bring to the work.   I am humbled by what I have learned of our forebears’ genius.  And this I wish to share.  It is for others with the requisite skills and expertise to go where I lack the knowledge to follow.  My archive will save them time.   
 There is no need to find again what I have already found.   As I wrote in The Holy Place :“I have entered a ‘treasure chamber’ … But I suspect that I have glimpsed only a small part of the treasure.”
Sapiens nihil affirmat quod non probet.   The wise man affirms nothing, which he cannot prove … and the beginnings of the proofs lie within the archive. As I enter my eighty-fourth year I am content to stand on the shore and wish Bon Voyage to whoever may wish to undertake the journey upon which I have made the first faltering steps.

We have established this scholarship fund to honor her spirit and support other activists to have the opportunity to participate in the Buddhist Education for Social Transformation (BEST) training program in northern Thailand. Sangsuree graduated from the first cohort of BEST in 2014 and was on the faculty for the second year of the program at the time of her death.</p>
<p><b>Our goal is to fund three BEST scholarships through this campaign, in Sangsuree's memory.</b></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Who Was Nicole Sangsuree Barrett?</h3> <p>As a songwriter, artist, musician, puppeteer, farmer, and teacher, Sangsuree gave herself completely to the cause of liberation and justice for all beings. She fully embraced her own identity as a mixed-race, queer woman. </p>
<p>Sangsuree earned her bachelor’s in theater arts and women and gender studies from the University of Oregon, and completed a graduate degree at Portland State University just this past year. She taught an urban farming series at Portland Community College and worked as a waste reduction educator. In Thailand, Sangsuree studied seed saving and natural building at Pun Pun Organic Farm, and she became deeply involved with the work of the International Women's Partnership for Peace and Justice, based north of Chiang Mai. You can read more about her many accomplishments in <a href=""http://www.pdx.edu/sustainability/solutions-blog/the-legacy-of-nicole-sangsuree-barrett"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this article</a> by Heather Spalding, director of the PSU Sustainability Leadership Center, who worked with Sangsuree. </p>
<p>Sang's love of the earth was palpable and some of the greatest gifts she gave to all of us were rituals and songs that helped us to re-connect with the wisdom inherent in nature. One of the last songs Sang recorded, with the help of Emma Carroll, was ""Fistful of Bones,"" her original song woven around a beautiful chant, ""Earth My Body.""</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""She spied your highest potential, your unseen sides, and knew exactly how you need to be encouraged, 'C'mon now, I see You in there, show me.

<p>Sang was only 34 years old when she was killed after being hit by a car in Chiang Mai on the night of July 17. As news of her death spread, the many communities she was part of have come forward to express their great love and respect for her, and to connect with each other. This, too, is part of Sang's legacy -- a growing awareness of our points of connection and an aspiration to support the work of healing and liberation going on in many quarters. </p>

<p>We’ve successfully raised $3,000 for tuition support, facilitator training, and computer access.  Now we’re setting our sights a little higher with a stretch goal of $4,000 to expand our operating budget.  </p>
<p>Our operating budget goes towards:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participant project budgets</p></li>
<li><p>Diverse supplies</p></li>
<li><p>Overhead including rent and utilities </p></li>
<li><p>Guest presentations</p></li>
<li><p>Furniture</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><p>Reaching our stretch goal will bring us closer to making Endor the best it can be and it will help us keep costs low for participants in the semesters to come.</p>
<br/><p>A <b>HUGE</b> thank you to everyone that has already contributed.  It’s really great to see so many people come together to support our project.</p>

<br/><br/><i><br/>What's the most important thing you ever learned? Where did you learn it? </i><br/><br/>Maybe it was how to tie your shoes, balance a checkbook, or drive a car. Maybe it came from on-the-job training, a great novel, or a bad break-up. <br/><br/>It inspired you to take action. It made you to talk to others. It helped you think about what you learned in a way that made it <i>real</i>.  <br/><br/>Because of all that, it's probably not something that you, along with millions of others, learned in school and only remembered while watching ""Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader?"" <br/><br/><p>The <b>Endor Initiative </b>is a <i>self-directed learning environment</i> where learning takes on this kind of realness, providing an alternate to ""teach to the test"" schools in Asheville, North Carolina. <br/></p>
<p>We'd love your support in attending Agile Learning Center training this summer, and to fund participants and supplies for our program next fall. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who is Endor? What's an Agile Learning Center? <br/>
</h3>
<b>Endor</b> is a place to honor what our high school aged participants bring to the table (no curriculum: participants determine what’s worth spending time on), do away with 
systems of ranking (no grades: participants create internal measurements
 of value), break down hierarchies (no teachers), and provide a system 
of community and peer supported education (the local Endor and global 
Agile Learning Center ecosystems) that are missing from most traditional
 school philosophies and environments. <br/><br/><b>Agile Learning Centers</b> are an educational model for communities of happy, actualized people in a network that shares resources, tools, and experiences.<b> Endor</b> and the <b>ALCs</b> believe that learning happens in cycles of intention, creation, and reflection, and facilitators work with participants to develop these skills. You can read more about ALCs here: <a href=""http://agilelearningcenters.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://agilelearningcenters.org/</a><br/><br/><p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Want to support us in this generative new model of education?! We aim to raise $3000, contributing: </p>
<p></p> <ul> <li>$1000 towards Endor Facilitators attending Agile Learning Facilitator (ALF) Summer training </li>
<li> $1000 towards tuition support for Endor participants <br/>
</li>
<li> $1000 towards Chromebooks for Endor participants<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange, we're excited to offer you: <br/></p>
<ul> <li>Unique Endor baseball T-shirts (there are also a few 2011 and 2013 Endor pocket T-shirts available!)<br/>
</li>
<li>Original music</li>
<li>Home baked cakes</li>
<li>Golden stickers</li>
<li>and more. . .<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our $3000 goal, our #1 priority is to get our facilitators to the ALF Summer, which will ultimately support both our participants and the ALC ecosystem. Our second priority is making Endor affordable, and will go towards tuition support for our participants. Our third priority for this campaign is to increase our participants' access to computers. </p>
<p>In addition, all of the documentation created at ALF Summer is open source, so you too can benefit from our experimentation!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>We often get our understanding of what has value, and even of why we have value, from structures outside of our day-to-day control (like our government or mass media). </p>

We’ve successfully raised $3,000 for tuition support, facilitator training, and computer access.  Now we’re setting our sights a little higher with a stretch goal of $4,000 to expand our operating budget.  
Our operating budget goes towards:

Participant project budgets
Diverse supplies
Overhead including rent and utilities 
Guest presentations
Furniture

Reaching our stretch goal will bring us closer to making Endor the best it can be and it will help us keep costs low for participants in the semesters to come.
A HUGE thank you to everyone that has already contributed.  It’s really great to see so many people come together to support our project.
-The Endor Team

What's the most important thing you ever learned? Where did you learn it? Maybe it was how to tie your shoes, balance a checkbook, or drive a car. Maybe it came from on-the-job training, a great novel, or a bad break-up. It inspired you to take action. It made you to talk to others. It helped you think about what you learned in a way that made it real.  Because of all that, it's probably not something that you, along with millions of others, learned in school and only remembered while watching ""Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader?"" The Endor Initiative is a self-directed learning environment where learning takes on this kind of realness, providing an alternate to ""teach to the test"" schools in Asheville, North Carolina. 
We'd love your support in attending Agile Learning Center training this summer, and to fund participants and supplies for our program next fall. 


Who is Endor? What's an Agile Learning Center? 

Endor is a place to honor what our high school aged participants bring to the table (no curriculum: participants determine what’s worth spending time on), do away with 
systems of ranking (no grades: participants create internal measurements
 of value), break down hierarchies (no teachers), and provide a system 
of community and peer supported education (the local Endor and global 
Agile Learning Center ecosystems) that are missing from most traditional
 school philosophies and environments. Agile Learning Centers are an educational model for communities of happy, actualized people in a network that shares resources, tools, and experiences. Endor and the ALCs believe that learning happens in cycles of intention, creation, and reflection, and facilitators work with participants to develop these skills. You can read more about ALCs here: http://agilelearningcenters.org/
  What We Need & What You Get 
Want to support us in this generative new model of education?! We aim to raise $3000, contributing: 
  $1000 towards Endor Facilitators attending Agile Learning Facilitator (ALF) Summer training 
 $1000 towards tuition support for Endor participants 

 $1000 towards Chromebooks for Endor participants


In exchange, we're excited to offer you: 
 Unique Endor baseball T-shirts (there are also a few 2011 and 2013 Endor pocket T-shirts available!)

Original music
Home baked cakes
Golden stickers
and more. . .


If we don't reach our $3000 goal, our #1 priority is to get our facilitators to the ALF Summer, which will ultimately support both our participants and the ALC ecosystem. Our second priority is making Endor affordable, and will go towards tuition support for our participants. Our third priority for this campaign is to increase our participants' access to computers. 
In addition, all of the documentation created at ALF Summer is open source, so you too can benefit from our experimentation!

    The Impact 
We often get our understanding of what has value, and even of why we have value, from structures outside of our day-to-day control (like our government or mass media). 
We believe that when human beings determine how to spend our time, we gain the skills to create our reality, take responsibility for our choices, and create an internal sense of our value and what's worth doing. 
This model challenges the way many of us work and learn, which is likely inside of big-system structures that we didn't help create.   
Our ultimate vision is that practicing these collaborative learning processes with our participants will make our entire community more likely to make decisions that support the health of our environment, our lives, and our humanity.

</p><b>What is the project?</b><br/><br/>The <b>Developing Nations Entrepreneurship Showcase</b> is the final step in the <b>Change the World Internships</b> initiative, a global partnership whose goal is to train young leaders, promote sustainable development, and create new jobs in local communities. Before the Showcase, these young entrepreneurs have already been through a rigorous, life-changing training program, including:<br/><br/><b>1) </b>Creating and submitting a comprehensive proposal for a social or business entrepreneurship that creates jobs in local communities and makes a difference in their society<br/><br/><b>2)</b> If accepted into the initiative, attending a bootcamp and getting trained in leadership and business skills<br/><br/><b>3) </b>Completing the <b>Change the World Internship</b>, a 4-month virtual internship which includes mentoring to take their ideas to the next level by creating an action plan and working with leading entrepreneurs to refine and implement their business goals. This involves online training, speaking with potential customers to validate their business model, final revisions, creating a working proof of concept, and finally, pitching their initiative to a panel of judges (all seasoned entrepreneurs). <br/><br/>2 teams from the Caribbean and 2 from India have been chosen as the winners of this initiative. <br/><br/><b>The prize: Coming to the U.S. in October to showcase their work at the U.N. and in Washington, D.C. at the Developing Nations Entrepreneurship Showcase.</b><br/><br/><b>Why is this important?</b><br/><b><br/></b>There are 73 million young men and women around the world who are unemployed — especially in the developing world. Empowering a person with the skills and training needed to lead their community and create work opportunities can completely transform their own lives, and the lives of those around them.<br/><br/><p><b>Who We Are </b></p><p>Driven by our passion and purpose, the teams of <a href=""http://activate1m1b.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>A Million for A Billion (1M1B)</u></a> and the <a href=""http://globalleadershipcoalition.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Global Leadership Coalition (GLC)</u></a> have come together to pilot <i>CHANGE THE WORLD INTERNSHIPS</i>.

Before the Showcase, these young entrepreneurs have already been through a rigorous, life-changing training program, including:1) Creating and submitting a comprehensive proposal for a social or business entrepreneurship that creates jobs in local communities and makes a difference in their society2) If accepted into the initiative, attending a bootcamp and getting trained in leadership and business skills3) Completing the Change the World Internship, a 4-month virtual internship which includes mentoring to take their ideas to the next level by creating an action plan and working with leading entrepreneurs to refine and implement their business goals. This involves online training, speaking with potential customers to validate their business model, final revisions, creating a working proof of concept, and finally, pitching their initiative to a panel of judges (all seasoned entrepreneurs). 2 teams from the Caribbean and 2 from India have been chosen as the winners of this initiative. The prize: Coming to the U.S. in October to showcase their work at the U.N. and in Washington, D.C. at the Developing Nations Entrepreneurship Showcase.Why is this important?There are 73 million young men and women around the world who are unemployed — especially in the developing world. Empowering a person with the skills and training needed to lead their community and create work opportunities can completely transform their own lives, and the lives of those around them.Who We Are Driven by our passion and purpose, the teams of A Million for A Billion (1M1B) and the Global Leadership Coalition (GLC) have come together to pilot CHANGE THE WORLD INTERNSHIPS.
 Rather than outside 'experts' coming into communities with often 
ineffective, surface solutions, we are engaging the local community to 
solve their own problems and generate employment.               The core team members of the Change the World Internships are a group 
of diverse and dedicated game changers, several of whom have left full-time corporate jobs to pursue their passion and purpose in making a difference for others. We have experience and expertise in business, entrepreneurship, social innovation, healthcare, international development, multilateral engagement, communication, education, music, media and journalism. We are united in our belief that the world functions holistically, and that collectively people — and especially youth and women — have the power to act and create our future.(See our team here and here)What is our goal?We Need $36,000 to make this happen. We have invested our time and resources to get the Entrepreneurship Challenge initiative to this stage, and now we need you for the final push. The money we are raising will enable the finalists to come to New York in October to showcase their solutions at the U.N., and to Washington D.C. if we reach our stretch goal.Where does the money go?The sum total of $36,000 goes directly to fund travel, hotel, and meals for a 3-day trip to New York for 12 people — 8 entrepreneurs and 4 country program managers. This breaks down to:• $4,000 per person for 6 people from India, including 4 Entrepreneurs and 2 Program Managers;• $3,000 per person for 3 people from the Caribbean, including 2 Entrepreneurs and 1 Support Staff;• $1,000 per person for 3 people from US, including 2 Entrepreneurs and 1 Program Manager.Stretch goalsStretch Goal 1: Trip to Washington, D.C.With an additional $18,000 we will extend the trip by 2 days and take the teams to Washington, D.C., where they will be given an opportunity to present their businesses to various multilateral and bilateral organizations, government officials, investors, and venture capitalists at a special event hosted by Washington, D.C.- based investor group DC ArchAngels.Stretch Goal 2: Marketing & Promotion of Project SuccessAn additional $18,000 will give us the funding to document the project including creating videos, case studies and brochures, which will be used to promote the organization as we move into our 2016 program.Get involvedWe appreciate you taking this time to read about our work and this campaign!

<h3>What is Ruralive?</h3>

<p><b>How did this happen?</b></p>
<p><b>Ruralive Colombia</b> emerges as a response of Grameen Caldas’ Holistic Movement of Social Business, following the Professor Muhammad Yunus’ principles, who defines a Social Business as a tool for poverty eradication, created with the aim of solving social problems in a self-sustaining way.

<br/><p></p>
<p>Why this campaign?</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are only six families in Ruralive’s program, taking into account that<br/>Ruralive opened just a year ago. Nevertheless, we have provided tourism services to more than 140 travelers from all over the world (Argentina, Chile, Peru, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, France, Japan, Sweden, Belgium, Australia and 10 other countries). We actually have other 18 families waiting to be part of Ruralive Colombia; therefore, we need this program to be expanded to many more people to meet the needs of these families.</p>
<p>In order to make these improvements, we knocked on the doors of companies and organizations that through their donations could achieve this. The project costs are US$8,600 and we already have US$5000, we only need to collect US$3,600 dollars to carry out the Works.</p>
<p><b>What if we do not collect all the money?</b></p>
<p>Each family requires $150 and so to cover the 24 families that are part of our initiative, we need a total of $3,600. Should we not reach our goal, we have decided to allocate the funds to those most in need and cover the full amount for an entire home improvement rather than split the funds amongst all families.</p>
<ul>
<li>$150 = 1 family</li>
<li>$750 = 5 families</li>
<li>$1,300 = 10 families</li>
<li>$2,600 = 20 families</li>
<li>$3,600 = 24 families</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonetheless, we expect to be able to fully fund the program!</p>
<p><strong>What if we collect more than expected?</strong></p>
<p>All the money collected will be invested in the quality of life of these families which<br/>will be reflected in the increase of tourists who will feel safe and comfortable while staying with our rural families. Every single step we take, with your help, is a closer goal to have more families overcoming poverty.</p>
<p><b>How does the reward work?</b></p>

<p><strong>This Campaign</strong> is designed to help Kris Brandhagen to gain the remaining funds required for her to attend the Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD) University (dream school) in Toronto. Why? To obtain her Interdisciplinary Master's of Art, Media and Design. That's a mouthful!</p>
<p>Kris is a Regina artist whose photography is concerned with the abstract, as well as stop motion animation. She has presented three solo exhibitions, and participated in a number of group shows and performances. Also a writer and critic, Brandhagen has been published by a number of periodicals since 2001. To see more of her work please visit brandphotography.wordpress.com or brandhagen.tumblr.com.</p>
<p>Kris is very proud to say that she has already obtained part time employment as a Teaching Assistant at OCAD U for the fall and winter semesters, as well as a small scholarship from the institution itself. She has been applying for all of the scholarships and bursaries that are applicable to her circumstances but her funding is still coming up a bit short.</p>
<p>Having juggled jobs while pursuing other educational opportunities, Kris knows that working too much while attempting to focus on full-time studies is not conducive, therefore, she is doing everything she can, including this crowdraiser, to patch together the funds necessary to attend.</p>
<p><strong>The reasons for this educational step?</strong> For an artist at Kris's level of expertise and experience, completing a Master's of Fine Art (MFA) is the logical next step. This level of education shows determination and perseverance, and is one way of professionalizing the emerging artist. It is a rite of passage. With the teaching, research and publishing already moving along, Kris will likely gain work as a professor subsequently.</p>
<p><strong>Why Toronto?</strong> Toronto would put Kris on the world sphere, leading to other important opportunities elsewhere. There will be brilliant networking opportunities with other arts professionals already living there as well as the many visiting artists coming through. From that position, she could conceivably make important contributions, to the art world, through exhibitions.</p>
<p>Many expenses go into this level of education, from tuition and fees to computer and software fees to books and supplies on top of all of the regular expenses that go along with life. Tuition and fees alone for the first year come to nearly seven thousand dollars.</p>
Please help to get the word out and make some noise about Kris's campaign.</div></div>","This Campaign is designed to help Kris Brandhagen to gain the remaining funds required for her to attend the Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD) University (dream school) in Toronto.

</p><p>With over 21, 000 inmates returning to Arizona’s communities

faces when re-entering society after incarceration.  The most prevalent challenges include
employment, housing, health, family reunification, education and other support
for stabilization.  These barriers have a
direct impact on our community’s economic health and public safety by
contributing to the high rate of recidivism (number of people who end up
returning to jail or prison).  </p>

<p>The Construction Career Training Program (CCTP) was founded
in Minnesota in 2002 by David Adolfson, Chairman Emeritus at Adolfson &amp;
Peterson Construction, as a faith-based program to help formerly incarcerated
individuals learn construction trades and find work in the industry.  Today, CCTP has headquarters in Minnesota and
Arizona.  The Arizona division has successfully
served more than 110 individuals, ages 18 through 68, since August 2014. Our
program focuses on the future of our participants, rather than their past.  CCTP Arizona provides:</p>

<p>These services are provided for formerly incarcerated
adults, as well as young adults who are at-risk for entering the criminal
justice system due to poverty, limited education, limited opportunities and
other negative social barriers.</p>
<p>As a result of our work, Arizona will experience an overall
reduction in the statewide recidivism rate, communities healing as crime
decreases, and a savings of millions of dollars to the citizens and taxpayers,
as formerly incarcerated men and women grow to be respected, successful, and
contributing members of their communities. Arizona is also experiencing an increase in the number of trained employees in the construction industry.<br/></p>

</h3><p></p></div>","Short Summary
Hello! My name is Hugh Willard. I am a psychotherapist and author of The Goodwill Vultures Club book series. I wrote this chapter book series with a few key objectives in mind. First, I wanted to increase awareness and understanding about persons with special needs. This goes a long ways towards increasing acceptance and empathy for folks who are different. Second, I hoped to capture the interest and love of reading for elementary aged boys. Statistics consistently show a precipitous drop in reading for our young men by the time they reach the middle grades. The resulting negative impacts are far reaching. Finally, I also wished to help the greater public better understand the central role that animals serve in our lives and well-being. To these ends, I am conducting this crowdfunding campaign, titled “Special People, Special Pets”. I hope to raise money to bulk purchase the first book in the series, “A Day of Heroes”. 
   What We Need & What You Get
All of the funds will go to buy the books at cost. The books will be donated to Bonnie’s Book Foundation. This is a wonderful local non-profit agency supporting children’s literacy by giving books to children from low income families. They also support local schools and other programs that serve at-risk youth. As an incentive, if you make a donation of $50, I will send you a signed copy of A Day of Heroes. For a $100 donation, I will send you signed copies of the full Goodwill Vultures Club series (3 volumes).
   The Impact
My intention is to use 100% of the funds raised towards the purchase of the books to donate. My goal is to raise $1000. After Indiegogo’s administrative costs, this should buy about 128 books. The more money raised, the more books that will be purchased. I will receive no profit from the purchase of the books. This will increase the number that can be bought and given to the kids. If the funds goal is not reach, the good news is we will still use all of the monies to buy books for the children.
  Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to financially contribute, I can still use your help. The more we can spread the word about this campaign, the more interest and support we can garner. Would you please consider letting your family, friends, and colleagues know about this worthwhile effort? I thank you in advance for helping in this important project.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

What happens when two moms -  a curriculum-writing Educator/Administrator and an entrepreneurial Fundraiser/Major Event Planner put their minds together? Pure Excellence! 
But, when you throw in that they are both Bronx, NY natives?


Well...the Sky's the Limit!













Entrepreneurs create 75% of all new jobs in our economy. 


7 out of 10 high school students want to start their own companies.


Less than 25% of high school students are offered a business or entrepreneurial course by the time they graduate.








The Mission of Sky’s the Limit Youth Academy is to create a mentor-guided, exploratory, educational environment where, through a supportive community of their peers, young people can develop a deeper level of creativity, self-expression and entrepreneurial awareness that leads to business ownership.



SKY’S Aims To:



To be the most successful organization in the Baltimore Metropolitan area that serves as a vehicle of professional influence, knowledge attainment, and access to community resources for young people


To increase the number of youth-owned businesses by providing initial support and funding to high potential business concepts

To provide a franchise opportunity to teach, train, and model business owners’ habits of success to senior program participants 






Unlike many other Entrepreneurship-focused programs,
SKY'S goes beyond just business concepts and focuses on exposing our participants to a variety of learning opportunities and ""Habits of Success"".
SKY'S leverages the relationships with our community partners to provide needed resources for our participants.
SKY'S Success Coaches work with each of our Executives to brainstorm, plan, develop, and fully execute viable businesses.
