</h3><p>In our community there are children who cant attend preschool simply because they don't qualify for transportation. There are at risk teens, home alone after school. 102.7 The Hog would like to help change that.</p><p>102.7 The Hog is a non profit radio station. Our goal is to assist local early childhood education and teen mentoring programs. We want to help get children transportation to school and help those schools and teachers with giving our youngest children the best education possible. We want to work with teen outreach and mentoring programs to help these young people make good decisions.</p><p>But to do this, we need to get on the air. With an FM signal, we can attract more programing underwriters and show sponsors. This means revenue that we can use to assist and promote these local programs.  </p><br/><h3>Why Part 2?<br/>
</h3><p>As the name implies, this is the second round of our fundraising drive. The <a href=""http://www.alturl.com/rankw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">First Round</a> got us closer to our funding goal and we want to thank the folks who donated. We raised just enough to buy 1 of the 2 antennas we'll need. We hope in this campaign to raise the rest of what we need to get on the air<br/></p><p></p><h3>Why $5,000?<br/>
</h3><p></p><p>In our First Round, we set a funding goal that would have covered all the equipment we would have liked to have had.

In our community there are children who cant attend preschool simply because they don't qualify for transportation. There are at risk teens, home alone after school. 102.7 The Hog would like to help change that.102.7 The Hog is a non profit radio station. Our goal is to assist local early childhood education and teen mentoring programs. We want to help get children transportation to school and help those schools and teachers with giving our youngest children the best education possible. We want to work with teen outreach and mentoring programs to help these young people make good decisions.But to do this, we need to get on the air. With an FM signal, we can attract more programing underwriters and show sponsors. This means revenue that we can use to assist and promote these local programs.  Why Part 2?
As the name implies, this is the second round of our fundraising drive. The First Round got us closer to our funding goal and we want to thank the folks who donated. We raised just enough to buy 1 of the 2 antennas we'll need. We hope in this campaign to raise the rest of what we need to get on the airWhy $5,000?
In our First Round, we set a funding goal that would have covered all the equipment we would have liked to have had. In this round, we're asking for just whats needed to get on the air. That means a transmitter, an Emergency Broadcast unit and 1 more antenna. Combined with what we received in the first round, this should get us close to having everything we need to get on the air.We Want to Give You a Little Something for Your Help

  The Impact ParaDYM Academy has worked with at-risk and marginalized students throughout Central and Southern Connecticut, but our primary focus is the city of New Britain, which is plagued by poverty and an over-taxed school system that is ill equipped to prepare many of its most promising students a chance at a better future.  With 26% of students below the age of 18 living below the poverty line, a matriculation rate that hovers around %50, a juvenile detention rate at the high school twice the state average at %6 and the fifth largest percentile of the prison population, New Britain is a city where opportunity and achievement seem rare and often unattainable your its young citizens.ParaDYM Academy has worked alongside  students, many of whom had already been written off by authority figures their communities, like teachers and other program administrators, simply because they under preformed academically or they seemed to lack focus.   The majority of our 8th grade students have said no one has ever spoken to them about the possibilities of attaining a degree, even though Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) is within walking distance of Downtown New Britain, and many have been ridiculed for even having such aspirations even by members of their own families.This is why youth voice initiatives are important in general, and why ParaDYM Academy is specifically ideal for at-risk students.  We not only allow them to explore the power of their voice for self-exploration and as young citizens, thanks to our continued partnership with CCSU and the New Britain Unified School District, we create a pathway that bridges the achievement gap and digital divide that so far has brought over 100 at-risk and marginalized students form the background to the forefront of 21st Century skill development and youth voice.   Risks & Challenges The two major obstacles we face in aiding our students along their journey of self-discovery and future development are parental engagement and not having a dedicated space for them to call their own.  Although our students are excited about the opportunities that arise out of their participation in ParaDYM projects, they still need their parents support for simple things like active participation, transportation to the program and other location sites and outside food costs. We have reached out to CCSU and they are providing grad interns to help make it easier for us to connect with parents and keep in touch with them about any barriers that may be blocking them from fully engaging with their children while they are participating in ParaDYM programs.  We find that students whose parents are even just more likely to stop by and see what we are doing tend to explore more options and actively assume leadership roles within the Academy experience.Secondly, having a home base would allow us to provide a safe secure space for self-exploration, expression and production.  Although we are grateful for all off the assistance we have been able to receive from the organizations which have housed us in the past, we have had to deal with security issues and work around the schedules of our partnering organizations.  this has lead to damage and theft of equipment and reduced our ability to serve our students.  The creation of our digital arts space/studio will cater to the needs of our students in a safe, secure environment dedicated to the creation of digital youth media as well as college prep and workforce development.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">My name is Laith Abu
Zeyad, I am 23 years old and living in Palestine. I am prospective postgraduate student. I have recently graduated from
Al-Quds Bard Honors College, where I was awarded a first-class honors degree in
International Law and Human Rights. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I have known in my heart since I was a
little boy what I wanted to be when I grew up. It was not a stereotypical
child’s dream such as a doctor or an astronaut; my vision was instead something
that has shaped my actions and decisions throughout my life. In the last few
years I have realized that my passion for human rights is a natural calling
that I am destined to follow.  I have
striven for academic excellence, always wishing to make the most of my
education. Having completed my undergraduate degree, I am now keen to continue my studies. I would like to further specialize in the Human Rights field, with the ultimate intention of helping implement, promote and protect human rights laws in Palestine.  This Master’s program will
add a practical experience to my academic experience that I already have. The
most important thing is to enjoy mutually rewarding, co-operative working
relationships with students from all over the world, to work together
effectively and positively, and enjoys the happy. I am interested in a new
challenge and an opportunity to use my academic skills and experiences in a
different capacity. Education has always been an important aspect of my life. </span><br/><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Although, education plays a significant role
in my life, I am involved with many other activities. During high school I was
an active member of several clubs. I enjoyed helping others with schoolwork and
have continued to help them at the college level. I have worked on a summer
research project at Al-Quds Human Rights Clinic, and I have done an
internship at the Heart Mountain Interpretive Learning Center in the United
States. I have also done community work in Palestine and during my time in the
United States, such as planted gardens, cleaned up streets, coat sale at the
Methodist Church, and a special after school reading program for the Big
Brother Big Sister Organization in the United States. All of these experiences
have helped to shape me.</span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Having been born in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories, my rights have been violated a lot. I </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">have been born into one of the most complicated and protracted conflicts
in the world, encompassing 60 years of conflict and 42 years of military
occupation. I come from a middle class Palestinian family, thus I do not receive any financial support
from my family or government to fund my college education. Therefore my
financial needs are very high. </span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Recently, I have
been offered a full scholarship to read for my master's degree in Human Rights
at the London School of Economics and Political Science in the UK. The
main reason I want to go on this journey is because of the excellent
program offered in that specialization. I have striven for academic
excellence, always wishing to make the most of my education. So, I believe that
this opportunity will enable me to fulfill my desire to expand my knowledge,
and to help others. </span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Unfortunately, I cannot
currently afford to pay my own way through a postgraduate course. Despite being
the recipient of a scholarship from the LSE, the combined cost of tuition fees
and living expenses is simply unworkable. The LSE is generously covering
my academic fees, but the
challenge now is to secure funding for my living expenses in London. </span><br/><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I do believe that young leaders make
change, and I do believe that I can do something through my education,
“education is my weapon.” </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I am seeking a
Master’s Degree in Human Rights because I’m hoping to help implement, promote,
and protect human rights laws in Palestine. LSE’s program in Human Rights will
challenge my beliefs and will give me the diverse platform I need in order to
be successful in my field. I look forward to the challenge, the diversity, and
the preparation for my field that an education from LSE would bring. Through studying human rights at LSE, I can perform
tasks that Palestinians cannot do for themselves; </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I want to make a difference wherever I possibly can. I’m always
willing to change the entire world for the better. Every harmed person is
deserving of help, of respect and dignity. Me, as an educated person, I have a special responsibility
to speak out against injustice, challenge power, and provide alternatives. I
have had a large number of people such as my family, my professors, and my
friends who are wonderful, and who have had an influence on my life. I would
one day like to give back what they have given to me by becoming a successful
person in the future. I know that this Master’s program would help me to
achieve my goals and once my goals are realized I will be able to provide
something meaningful to all of the people. </span><br/><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What I Need</span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I am kindly asking you to
help me pursue this Masters program at the LSE by contributing to
cover some of my living expenses there. As you all know, Living in the UK – particularly London, England – is expensive compared to many places in the World.  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Average student rents are approximately £150 per week,</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> in addition to my rent, I will need approximately £104 per week for living costs. Thus, i need to raise enough money to cover the approximate cost of 10,000 USD for the entire academic year at the LSE. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I would greatly appreciate your financial

Additionally, I ask each of you to become an ambassador for my campaign. Please spread the word among your own circle of friends and contacts through Facebook and other social-media channels. This will rapidly build awareness, and will truly help me reach my fundraising goal.

</div></div>","My Story 
My name is Laith Abu
Zeyad, I am 23 years old and living in Palestine. I am prospective postgraduate student. I have recently graduated from
Al-Quds Bard Honors College, where I was awarded a first-class honors degree in
International Law and Human Rights. I have known in my heart since I was a
little boy what I wanted to be when I grew up. It was not a stereotypical
child’s dream such as a doctor or an astronaut; my vision was instead something
that has shaped my actions and decisions throughout my life. In the last few
years I have realized that my passion for human rights is a natural calling
that I am destined to follow.  I have
striven for academic excellence, always wishing to make the most of my
education. Having completed my undergraduate degree, I am now keen to continue my studies. I would like to further specialize in the Human Rights field, with the ultimate intention of helping implement, promote and protect human rights laws in Palestine.  This Master’s program will
add a practical experience to my academic experience that I already have. The
most important thing is to enjoy mutually rewarding, co-operative working
relationships with students from all over the world, to work together
effectively and positively, and enjoys the happy. I am interested in a new
challenge and an opportunity to use my academic skills and experiences in a
different capacity. Education has always been an important aspect of my life. Although, education plays a significant role
in my life, I am involved with many other activities. During high school I was
an active member of several clubs. I enjoyed helping others with schoolwork and
have continued to help them at the college level. I have worked on a summer
research project at Al-Quds Human Rights Clinic, and I have done an
internship at the Heart Mountain Interpretive Learning Center in the United
States. I have also done community work in Palestine and during my time in the
United States, such as planted gardens, cleaned up streets, coat sale at the
Methodist Church, and a special after school reading program for the Big
Brother Big Sister Organization in the United States. All of these experiences
have helped to shape me.
Having been born in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories, my rights have been violated a lot. I have been born into one of the most complicated and protracted conflicts
in the world, encompassing 60 years of conflict and 42 years of military
occupation. I come from a middle class Palestinian family, thus I do not receive any financial support
from my family or government to fund my college education. Therefore my
financial needs are very high. 
Recently, I have
been offered a full scholarship to read for my master's degree in Human Rights
at the London School of Economics and Political Science in the UK. The
main reason I want to go on this journey is because of the excellent
program offered in that specialization. I have striven for academic
excellence, always wishing to make the most of my education. So, I believe that
this opportunity will enable me to fulfill my desire to expand my knowledge,
and to help others. 
Unfortunately, I cannot
currently afford to pay my own way through a postgraduate course. Despite being
the recipient of a scholarship from the LSE, the combined cost of tuition fees
and living expenses is simply unworkable. The LSE is generously covering
my academic fees, but the
challenge now is to secure funding for my living expenses in London. The ImpactI do believe that young leaders make
change, and I do believe that I can do something through my education,
“education is my weapon.” I am seeking a
Master’s Degree in Human Rights because I’m hoping to help implement, promote,
and protect human rights laws in Palestine. LSE’s program in Human Rights will
challenge my beliefs and will give me the diverse platform I need in order to
be successful in my field. I look forward to the challenge, the diversity, and
the preparation for my field that an education from LSE would bring. Through studying human rights at LSE, I can perform
tasks that Palestinians cannot do for themselves; I want to make a difference wherever I possibly can. I’m always
willing to change the entire world for the better. Every harmed person is
deserving of help, of respect and dignity. Me, as an educated person, I have a special responsibility
to speak out against injustice, challenge power, and provide alternatives. I
have had a large number of people such as my family, my professors, and my
friends who are wonderful, and who have had an influence on my life. I would
one day like to give back what they have given to me by becoming a successful
person in the future. I know that this Master’s program would help me to
achieve my goals and once my goals are realized I will be able to provide
something meaningful to all of the people. What I NeedI am kindly asking you to
help me pursue this Masters program at the LSE by contributing to
cover some of my living expenses there. As you all know, Living in the UK – particularly London, England – is expensive compared to many places in the World.  Average student rents are approximately £150 per week, in addition to my rent, I will need approximately £104 per week for living costs. Thus, i need to raise enough money to cover the approximate cost of 10,000 USD for the entire academic year at the LSE. I would greatly appreciate your financial
support in whatever amount
you can contribute, Any help that you might
be able to offer would be very gratefully received.Other Ways You Can HelpDonations from friends, family, associates and the public at large will, of course, be the greatest help. Additionally, I ask each of you to become an ambassador for my campaign. Please spread the word among your own circle of friends and contacts through Facebook and other social-media channels. This will rapidly build awareness, and will truly help me reach my fundraising goal. I feel it will not be so onerous to raise $10,000 to cover all of my living expenses in London for one year.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>These days young people are overwhelmed by having too many opportunities. Unfortunately a lot of them still don't see entrepreneurship and starting a company as a valid career path. Be it because of society that still doesn't accept entrepreneurship as something valuable or parents that want their children to have a stable income and a safe life. This is a problem that many societies face these days. A problem I am trying to fight by taking my bike and driving through
Germany, my homecountry. So far, I will hold about 10 presentations at major
universities where I will talk about my experiences as a founder and as 'an
employee on the investor side of the startup game. </p>
<p>The goal is to motivate and encourage young folks to start working on
their ideas and dreams, instead of joining the hamster running wheel of the corporate world. This
group of people is especially important to me, as they are our most important resource to drive innovative activities in in every country on this planet earth. Unfortunately it is also the group of people that has the least working experience and a very high failure rate. </p>

Project Summary

These days young people are overwhelmed by having too many opportunities. Unfortunately a lot of them still don't see entrepreneurship and starting a company as a valid career path. Be it because of society that still doesn't accept entrepreneurship as something valuable or parents that want their children to have a stable income and a safe life. This is a problem that many societies face these days. A problem I am trying to fight by taking my bike and driving through
Germany, my homecountry. So far, I will hold about 10 presentations at major
universities where I will talk about my experiences as a founder and as 'an
employee on the investor side of the startup game. 
The goal is to motivate and encourage young folks to start working on
their ideas and dreams, instead of joining the hamster running wheel of the corporate world. This
group of people is especially important to me, as they are our most important resource to drive innovative activities in in every country on this planet earth. Unfortunately it is also the group of people that has the least working experience and a very high failure rate. 

Sounds interesting!
What are your stops? 


These are just the locations I was able to setup myself. Feel free to add some dots to the map and invite me over to speak at your university, meetup group or entrepreneurship club! I would be more than happy to meet some
of you along the way. Here are the locations I will stop bye in October and beginning of November. 







Nice! But what will I get for supporting this project?
Depending on the funding size you will either get a hand-written thank you card, an early adopter certificate, the e-book or the printed version of my new book ""The Perfectly Executed Startup"". In the book I will talk about my experiences in the startup scene, my time as a founder in China, and what I learned while having worked in the VC scene in Germany and the United States. You will be introduced to a framework that will support you on your journey from testing your idea on the market, over building your team to getting funded. Here are the different bundles available:

<p>The solar panel was designed in-house specifically for use in heavily populated areas, as well as outdoors. <strong style=""font-size:106%;"">Since it doesn't require a frame or safety glass, it's much lighter than comparable systems, yet still tough.</strong> The top layer is made from ETFE, a plastic, which does not react with UV light, ensuring decades of use.</p>

<p>You might be asking why you'd want a home battery with your Smart Solar Panels. The reason is quite simple: <strong style=""font-size:106%;"">The problem with solar power is always that you produce most around noon time and not as much in the mornings and evenings, though you don't necessarily need all that power at noon. The solution is to shift that produced power using a battery as a buffer.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin:0;""><span style=""overflow: hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/512555533?portrait=0""></iframe></div> <p></p>
<p>When designing this battery, we had to balance the need for storage capacity with size &amp; weight for portability. <strong style=""font-size:106%;"">We found that equilibrium using our design.</strong> It's a powerful battery, but small and light enough to be carried. Should you do need more capacity, simply purchase our secondary batteries.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://craftstrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/craftstrom-fb-video-battery-app_1080x1080-v3-2.gif"" src="""" style=""width:695px;""/></p>
<p>When buying your first battery, you will receive a Primary battery, which includes the smart base. When upgrading the capacity, you will be purchasing Secondary batteries. These come with a smaller, non-smart, base that connects to the Primary battery base and are lower in price. The Secondary batteries are otherwise exactly the same and also offer 1,056 Wh of rater power.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size:106%;"">We offer a host of possibilities to charge and run devices directly from the battery.</strong> In fact, you can use the battery also as an Uninterruptible Power Supply, when you're not using it outdoors.</p>

<p>The Safety Gate Adapter is a patented tech to ensure our products are plug&amp;play, yet safe according to the National Electric Code in the USA. It works similarly to a circuit breaker in your home but is plugged into the standard power outlet, before our products. </p>
<p>Plug our products into any standard power outlet in your home with this device. The National Electric Code requires dedicated circuits to be used when installing solar panels. Since most people don't have such a dedicated circuit in their home, we have developed this sensor, which acts similar to a circuit breaker. As you install one of our main products, plug this in between the product and the power outlet. It will detect any new appliances being plugged into the same circuit and trigger with an audible click, which turns off our products.</p>

<h4 style=""margin:30px 0 10px;"">The Smart Solar Panel</h4>
<p>Our 320W Foldable &amp; Semiflexible Solar Panel is being produced at a supplier's factory in China, where it requires a multitude of stages to manufacture our panels. While we won't go into great detail here, here are some stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality check of raw PV cells</li>
<li>Cutting of PV cells (to achieve the desired Voltage)</li>
<li>Preparation of PV cells</li>
<li>Soldering of PV cells</li>
<li>Quality check of soldered PV cell-array</li>
<li>Layering of fabric, plastics, cell-array and ETFE</li>
<li>Lamination</li>
<li>Cutting of the solar panel, mounting holes and stamping of eyelets</li>
</ul>

<h4 style=""margin:30px 0 10px;"">The Smart Battery</h4>
<p>We are producing our Smart Battery at a specialised assembly company, which allows us to outsource, yet retain our IP. It requires hundreds of parts, many of which we extrude from plastic, though the main battery and offgrid inverter shells are made from highest grade Aluminium. We wanted the feel of the battery to reflect the sturdiness, which is why we chose to work with more metal than the competition. PCBAs are outsourced, as well as the manufacture of the battery cells. All parts are then combined to make three main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Battery - contains the battery cells, the Battery Management System (also proprietary), MPPT solar charger (for offgrid charging), USB connection ports and connection regulators.</li>
<li>The Smart Base - holds the Dynamic Power Inverter, which allows you to regulate power input and output, our WiFi module and connection PCBA that regulates the expansion batteries.</li>
<li>The Offgrid Inverter - Apart from the inverter PCBA, this also contains the wireless charing pad and regulator.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are there incentives for making your home energy efficient by installing alternative energy equipment?</p>
<p>A. Yes, the residential energy efficient property credit allows for a credit equal to the applicable percent of the cost of qualified property. Qualifying properties are solar electric property, solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps, small wind turbines and fuel cell property. Only fuel cell property is subject to a limitation, which is $500 with respect to each half kilowatt of capacity of the qualified fuel cell property. Generally, this credit for alternative energy equipment terminates for property placed in service after December 31, 2021.</p>
<p>The applicable percentages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of property placed in service after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2020, 30 percent.</li>
<li>In the case of property placed in service after December 31, 2019, and before January 1, 2021, 26 percent.</li>

Smart Solar Panel CraftStrom's First Customer

The Smart Solar Panel consists of our ultra-portable 320W solar panel, the WiFi-equipped solar inverter and a 15 foot cable to plug it into any outlet connected to your home. For customers in the United States, this package will also include the proprietary Safety Gate Adapter.

The solar panel was designed in-house specifically for use in heavily populated areas, as well as outdoors. Since it doesn't require a frame or safety glass, it's much lighter than comparable systems, yet still tough. The top layer is made from ETFE, a plastic, which does not react with UV light, ensuring decades of use.




Because the solar panel is both, semi-flexible and foldable, it is perfect to adjust to various surfaces. Hang it on a wall, a fence, a balcony railing, a tree or a shed, it's ridiculously easy using the eyelets.

Appliances Powered by 1 Panel in 1 YearSmart Solar Panel - SpecsSmart Battery   
You might be asking why you'd want a home battery with your Smart Solar Panels. The reason is quite simple: The problem with solar power is always that you produce most around noon time and not as much in the mornings and evenings, though you don't necessarily need all that power at noon. The solution is to shift that produced power using a battery as a buffer.
 
When designing this battery, we had to balance the need for storage capacity with size & weight for portability. We found that equilibrium using our design. It's a powerful battery, but small and light enough to be carried. Should you do need more capacity, simply purchase our secondary batteries.

When buying your first battery, you will receive a Primary battery, which includes the smart base. When upgrading the capacity, you will be purchasing Secondary batteries. These come with a smaller, non-smart, base that connects to the Primary battery base and are lower in price. The Secondary batteries are otherwise exactly the same and also offer 1,056 Wh of rater power.
We offer a host of possibilities to charge and run devices directly from the battery. In fact, you can use the battery also as an Uninterruptible Power Supply, when you're not using it outdoors.

The Smart Base is the brains and communication hub for the battery. It contains our proprietary inverter with dynamic charging and discharging. This means that, depending on your electricity production or consumption, the battery will adjust the power input or output.

Smart Battery - SpecsCraftStrom App
The CraftStrom App is a super-easy to use help for you to understand

How much electricity you're producing
How your production is helping the environment, such as through reduction of CO2 
If your system is working as expected
How much electricity you are using
How your production compares to your usage
How to save even more energy
How much electricity to send to the battery for later use

Download the App to learn more about how it can help you.    
Use our App to monitor and control your products. Manage your battery charge and discharge cycles, or opt for the automatic management, which will be done by the App itself.
The Dashboard is the focal point for all information coming from your panel and battery, including the power meter. 
Panels can monitored and controller, either individually or in total. This allows you to perfectly set up each panel for maximum gain and identify problems quickly.
Share the effect of your eco impact with friends via social media, or simply keep a record for yourself. Use this and suggestions from the automated assistant to lower your power bill even further. Safety Gate Adapter
The Safety Gate Adapter is a patented tech to ensure our products are plug&play, yet safe according to the National Electric Code in the USA. It works similarly to a circuit breaker in your home but is plugged into the standard power outlet, before our products. 
Plug our products into any standard power outlet in your home with this device. The National Electric Code requires dedicated circuits to be used when installing solar panels. Since most people don't have such a dedicated circuit in their home, we have developed this sensor, which acts similar to a circuit breaker. As you install one of our main products, plug this in between the product and the power outlet. It will detect any new appliances being plugged into the same circuit and trigger with an audible click, which turns off our products.
We include this safety device in all sets within the USA. European customers do not require this item.
Power Meter
Install this for permission free use of the Smart Solar Panel and/or the Smart Battery. Using two clamps to wrap around the main power lines in your breaker box, it will measure total electricity consumption in your home and report to you in real-time. You CraftStrom App will ensure that all of the electricity you produce will be used by you in your home. It is not included in every set, so please check!

Install our products permission-free (no interconnection agreement required)
Monitor your power consumption in real-time
Audit your monthly power bill

Installation is done by simply clamping the sensors around the mains, as seen in below picture, no tools required. The Power Meter does require an external power supply and can be plugged into any outlet.
Plug ProtectorAvoid any chance of touching the plug prongs with this additional safety device.Production TimelineHow It Works - At Home
You don't have to have a full-blown solar array on large plots of land. With classic systems, you're paying for way more than just the solar panels and battery cells. Any offer you get will include added costs for the installation, the roof mounting system, electrical works and many more. The cost of our system is transparent - there are no added fees.
Check out the chapter on cost savings for detailed information, at the bottom of the page.
The Smart Solar Panel and the Smart Battery will work together, using WiFi, to optimally use your solar power within your home and avoid back-feeding into the public grid. This way we can ensure that you really use 100% of your electricity, while avoiding having to deal with authorities.

Simply install the solar panel using zip ties, place the battery in your home and register the devices using our app. Our AI-powered software will then create an individual charging/discharging plan using weather forecasting. Using our power meter, you'll see how much electricity you're using in your home and can then use that information to save money even more efficiently.

Unpack/unfold
Zip-tie the solar panel to your balcony, or screw it onto a fence...it's up to you. We also have a nifty mount that we offer, which allows for even greater installation flexibility and even adjustments in the angle towards the sun.
Connect cables with snap connectors
Plug the Smart Solar Panel and/or the Smart Battery into any standard power outlet (using our Safety Gate Adapter) - production will start immediately.
Clip the power meter into the circuit breaker box (no tools needed).
Register all devices with barcodes in our free App.
Smart Battery Power Capability - Indoor UseHow It Works - On the go
Whether it's music or photography equipment - our daily lives are more and more dependent on electricity - privately and professionally. Let us help you save power and money at home, but use the battery also for power on-the-go. Charge multiple batteries at home, so you can leave at least one to keep saving money, while up to three additional batteries can be charged for other uses, as well.
When you're ready to go off-grid, simply disconnect the panel from its inverter, grab the battery out of its smart base and take them with you. Our panel folds up to its quarter size and only weighs about 18 pounds (8kg).
Smart Battery Power Capability - Indoor UseHow It Works - In Emergencies
Be prepared without having to buy an additional device. Whether you need emergency power in your home or outdoors, our solar panel + battery combo is a sophisticated partner in need. We've designed almost all components of the CraftStrom ecosystem in-house to ensure maximum benefit. 
You can use the solar panel (without the inverter) and the battery (without its base) by connecting them directly to one-another. This means that the solar panel and battery are optimally balanced. Charging the 1kWh battery directly from the solar panel takes only 4 hours. You can continuously power important appliances and devices, such as refrigerators or medical respiratory ventilators. 
Smart Battery Power Capability - Emergency UseHow It Works - Economically
But what are your financial benefits?
The first benefit is realized when buying our products, as you save on installation, operational and balancing system costs. This way we can offer you lightweight solar panels for extra mobility, but at the low price of 2.49 $/Watt, which is below the current average price for solar installations. You do not have to install enough solar panels to offset your entire electricity consumption - every bit helps!

Customers in Southern States or countries will be able to pay off their panels in as little as 5 years. 
Electricity Price Peak Times
For our customers with variable electricity prices, this is a common issue: Extremely high electricity prices are usually scheduled in the afternoon, as power demand increases and solar output decreases.


Total Benefit of Solar+Battery
To counter this effect, our Smart Battery ensures that your electricity production is spread-out throughout the day, especially in the afternoons and evenings. You can even tell it to buy cheap electricity from the grid and discharge that cheap electricity in the late morning, effectively giving you two cycles - one arbitrage and one with your own solar production.

Design
Design has been an integral part in this project from start to finish. We have developed every part in our product suite and all the necessary design genres came into play. Industrial design to provide for a visually stunning experience, process design to look for the simplest but most stable implementation of new technologies , UX/UI design to assure a smooth interaction with our app, allowing you to control the power flow intuitively. Graphic design to be able to explain this complex project in the most simple way. All handled in house so we can own the entire process from the first idea, to the delivered product!



The Engineering Process
CraftStrom is a startup with a diverse team from various backgrounds, such as mechanical and electrical engineering, software development, energy economics, law and marketing. We have developed all components in house, such as the:

Solar panel
Bi-directional battery inverter with dynamic power management
Portable AC 120/230 V inverter with high-speed wireless charging
Battery management system
Safety Gate Adapter (patent pending)
Power Meter 
Wifi modules
As well as all firmware and software packages


Where are we on Production?
The Smart Solar Panel, the Smart Battery and all safety products have undergone multiple iterations of prototypes and are ready for mass production. After our successful Kickstarter campaign, we will now commence with the production of tools still needed for the Smart Battery. 
The Smart Solar Panel
Our 320W Foldable & Semiflexible Solar Panel is being produced at a supplier's factory in China, where it requires a multitude of stages to manufacture our panels. While we won't go into great detail here, here are some stages:

Quality check of raw PV cells
Cutting of PV cells (to achieve the desired Voltage)
Preparation of PV cells
Soldering of PV cells
Quality check of soldered PV cell-array
Layering of fabric, plastics, cell-array and ETFE
Lamination
Cutting of the solar panel, mounting holes and stamping of eyelets

 
The 350W Smart Inverter with WiFi is also manufactured at a supplier's certified factory, where the housing is combined with the proprietary PCBA and our WiFi module that allows you to connect to the inverter from anywhere in the world. 

The Smart Battery
We are producing our Smart Battery at a specialised assembly company, which allows us to outsource, yet retain our IP. It requires hundreds of parts, many of which we extrude from plastic, though the main battery and offgrid inverter shells are made from highest grade Aluminium. We wanted the feel of the battery to reflect the sturdiness, which is why we chose to work with more metal than the competition. PCBAs are outsourced, as well as the manufacture of the battery cells. All parts are then combined to make three main components:

The Battery - contains the battery cells, the Battery Management System (also proprietary), MPPT solar charger (for offgrid charging), USB connection ports and connection regulators.
The Smart Base - holds the Dynamic Power Inverter, which allows you to regulate power input and output, our WiFi module and connection PCBA that regulates the expansion batteries.
The Offgrid Inverter - Apart from the inverter PCBA, this also contains the wireless charing pad and regulator.


Battery Function Test 
The CraftStrom Smart Battery consists of three major parts:

The smart base, which contains our dynamic power inverter, as well as the WiFi module.
The battery tower, which holds the Lithium Iron Phosphate cells and our proprietary Battery Management System.
The off-grid AC inverter, allowing you to power 120/230 Volt devices, with wireless charging pad. 

#AnOpenPlatform
We are developing CraftStrom to be an open platform for all you hobbyists and craftspeople who want to extend your CraftStrom system and integrate it with your other home automation projects. The data that you collect from your solar power generation and battery charge / discharge patterns in your CraftStrom account will be accessible to you through a HTTP REST API. This will allow you to download it and use it for other purposes and extend it in your DIY projects. We love open source, we use it in our work and we plan to open source a few of CraftStrom's key components as well to allow the community to build an ecosystem around our products and make them interoperable with other home automation devices. We can't wait to see what you will build!

Production and Quality Management
We are currently still manufacturing in China, until we can break out of the startup phase and develop our own manufacturing capabilities. We have two wonderful team members from Shenzhen, who aid in production and logistics. 
Quality management for us begins in the design phase, where all components are developed using only tier 1 parts. Since we have developed all components, we can guarantee quality from the start. 
Solar panel design and production, especially, are critical stages in our value chain. It begins with choosing the right solar cells, base and cover materials and ends in the continuous checks undertaken during the production process.

Tax Incentives Within The USA
Are there incentives for making your home energy efficient by installing alternative energy equipment?
A. Yes, the residential energy efficient property credit allows for a credit equal to the applicable percent of the cost of qualified property. Qualifying properties are solar electric property, solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps, small wind turbines and fuel cell property. Only fuel cell property is subject to a limitation, which is $500 with respect to each half kilowatt of capacity of the qualified fuel cell property. Generally, this credit for alternative energy equipment terminates for property placed in service after December 31, 2021.
The applicable percentages are:

In the case of property placed in service after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2020, 30 percent.
In the case of property placed in service after December 31, 2019, and before January 1, 2021, 26 percent.
 In the case of property placed in service after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2022, 22 percent.

CraftStrom History
We are a dedicated team of industry professionals with over 40 years of experience from a wide variety of fields. Our team consists of multiple engineers from the fields of electrical and mechanical engineering, software development, with specializations in battery development, energy efficiency, and machine learning. Industrial design, energy economics, marketing, and other, equally important industries round out our team. It’s the diversity in a professional experience that has helped us so far in the development of this ambitious project. This team was set up from within a group of friends, some of whom studied and worked together, meaning that we were aware of our flaws and mannerisms.
All team members have been involved in startups before, either as founders or as initial employees. Some experiences had already taken us into the solar and battery industries, with valuable experience gained in the manufacture and certification of batteries.
But we also bring the experience of failure, as one startup from within our group failed to gain any traction after considerable amounts of time and efforts were spent to realize a product (hardware and software). It’s this experience that we have used from the start to evaluate our ideas with customers and undertake continuous testing, as we go along.

Logistics
Please be aware that, due to the Covid-19 crisis, we might see some delays in shipping and customs, from China to the USA and Europe. We are working hard with our freight forwarder in Hong Kong to plan ahead and anticipate any issues. Shipping will be done via air freight and sea freight. We will ship using air shipment as much as possible, to ensure quick delivery to you.
Shipping rates are currently fixed at USD/EUR 120.00 per item (subject to change and we're scheduled to ship the Smart Panels in spring 2021) and we will cover any shipping costs above that.
Indiegogo does not allow for automatic VAT application, hence VAT is not included in these perk prices!
Risks & Challenges
Identified risks will be certifications for the battery and the timeline to receive those. Given our experience with certifying the inverter and solar panel though, we feel confident that we have a realistic timeline.
The main risk, however, is shipping in the current Covid-19 epidemic. Shipping resources are stretched and most companies don't have a lot of stock. We will keep you informed on this issue.",49.0,4,"1 Campaign

Especially in the wearable industry where new technologies become obsolete before they're even released in products! New processors, more pixels,...so many reasons to get distracted on what really matters, YOU!The new Sequent Titanium Elektron smart self-charging watch. Gives health monitoring a whole new look & feel. Collects your physiological data 24/7 to provide the most accurate and granular understanding of your body + autonomous micro-mechanical charging.  We invented a green charging solution that provides you an unparalleled power autonomy. Free yourself from battery anxiety! With just 8 parts we designed the next generation smart micro energy harvesting. When the oscillating weight starts moving through body movement, the magic starts, and you can feel the impulsive power generation.The fresh new concept provides virtually infinite power autonomy, as long as you regulary wear it. Once the internal power cell is fully charged it gives you a standby time of more than a year. The autonomous charging module is interconnected with the most cutting-edge health monitoring sensor technologies. The New Oxygen app is your -state of the art- health coach companion. A single place to sync on-demand and securely store all your data. Activity, steps, calories, sport tracking, heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking and even more. *The Oxygen app will only be released at the end of summerSwiss Super-LumiNova® (SLN) pigments are the preferred choice of the Swiss watch industry for the longest possible afterglow performance.SLN works like a light storage reservoir, where light charges the indexes, chapter ring, and hands and afterwards the light is continuously emitted. This activation and subsequent light emission process can be repeated again and again.Our unique 3D indexes are actually fully cast in SLN! It's not just printed or painted on like other watches. SLN is chargeable with sunlight or artificial light.Crafted from Grade 2 titanium, the new Elektron watch is superlight with only 55 grams. Makes you forget you are wearing it.The case is fully brush which gives a great sport look. The watches will be available in titanium color or black DLC coatedSapphire Is one of the hardest substances on earth. It measures 9 on the Mohs scale. Only diamond is harder.Made by crystallizing pure aluminum-oxide at very high temperatures. It is heated, then formed into round masses that are then sliced into pieces with diamond-coated saws. These disks are then ground and polished into watch crystals. (One reason sapphire crystals are relatively expensive is that the tools required to cut and polish this extremely hard material are very costly).Our watches are proudly designed in Switzerland and we work with specialists all around the world to deliver the best smartwatch possible.We are very proud to say that the Elektron will be hand assembled in Switzerland. Ensuring the best quality and expertise possible.

The A' Design Award Winner Logo symbolises exceptional design excellence in briiv and puts briiv alongside cutting edge design in fields of product, graphic, archtiecture, fashion and interior.
What causes poor indoor air quality?  
Pollutants don’t just come from traffic and factories. Tiny particles and harmful gases are released into your home every time you cook, light candles, use cleaning products and even play with your pets. briiv helps to remove these so you can enjoy life to its fullest.How does briiv compare to just using traditional house plants?Plants are amazing, there’s no denying thatWe have taken nature and given it a boost, briiv is as powerful as 3,043 medium size houseplants. So you can enjoy the benefits of having plants in your home without the hassle.    The problem with current filters15,000,000 air filters were purchased in 2019 and the filter needs to be replaced every 6-8 months.There is a better way. briiv is an innovative, natural product designed to be just as effective at cleaning the air you breathe, without the environmental impact.briiv is designed to return to the EarthUsing four fully biodegradable filters, briiv uses the natural micro-structures of moss, coconut, carbon and silk to filter air, the way nature intended. These filters are plastic-free and degrade in a matter of months into harmless soil.Clean air anywhere briiv blends beautifully into your interior and sits perfectly alongside plants or displayed as a centrepiece.  Feel closer to natureInspired by the British countryside, briiv uses natural colours, textures and materials to connect you with nature, whilst hidden within, a wealth of features works hard to keep your air clean.Protect cognitive function with better airflow and fewer toxins There is growing evidence that air pollutants are having noticeable detrimental effects on brain function, as demonstrated in a study by the Beijing Normal University in 2018;  'The impact of exposure to air pollution on cognitive performance'  Optional integration for Alexa and Google Assistant if you'd like to integrate briiv into your smart home.With one simple setup, briiv is zero maintenance – no watering required.The most sustainable filter on the planet end to end. When you’re done with the filter it can be thrown in the garden or compost to become part of the earth again. Designed to improve your environment, briiv is functional and looks great anywhere, bringing natural style to your home or office. briiv has a smart, simple app, so you can set timers and turn briiv off remotely. briiv is  a smart device for a modern home and is compatible with IOS and Android devices. An intelligent app that tracks your filter usage as it runs, so you don't have to estimate or worry about when it’s time to change it. Filter StagesNature with a touch of science gives us everything we need to filter the air we breathe. Moss - Natural dried moss captures large particulate matter like dust and animal dander from the air. Coconut -  The humble coconut provides us with a bounty of uses and its husk traps harmful substances from the air. Combination Silk Matrix - A newly engineered bespoke filter which combines both the elements of:Carbon - Activated charcoal which pulls odours from the air, so briiv not only cleans the air, it smells better too.Nanofibers - briiv’s secret weapon. Developed originally for the medical industry, these cutting edge filters remove the finest harmful particles from the air and are 100% biodegradable. Unlike HEPA filters that are produced from micro fibers, ours use Nano fibers that are far more efficient.   The raw silk is sourced from sustainably and humanely harvested moth cocoons. Designed to sit together for an optimal airflow all hidden within briiv.Natural proteins are spun into nanofibers that build up a layer of nanoscale filaments which capture very fine particles as they pass through. Conventionally these filaments are glass or plastic and can only achieve a micro level of mesh filament, and so larger particles get through.Our filters, using a nanoscale mesh, capture much finer particles with increased efficiency.briiv will effectively improve the air quality in a 36m² (387ft²) living space in just one hour.  
Development and testing
In total we have worked through 37 variations of this design, and the full filter was modelled and tested at every stage using the ISO 29463-5:2011 standard as basis for testing and evaluating with sensitive air monitors.Smoke Test Rig

Watch of how briiv clears the air! we created this standard smoke test, using an “off the shelf” cigarette to fully saturate the environment. briiv is then turned on remotely to clear the air in the tank and shows the complete removal of the smoke after one minute.
The graph above show the reduction in a 1 cubic meter test chamber over 10 mins with an initial low volume of fine PM2.5 fine particulate. (A similar but slightly larger version of the smoke video above.) We also run comparative tests on existing products to provide a baseline of how these perform under these same testing conditions with a high consistent particulate input, briiv removed 97.84% of all the particulates in one pass. We also run industry standard tests Direct flow testing method measures the reduction of particulate in one pass, under 2 simulated environments with a constant supply of test particulate entering the device over a set period of time. The above shows the PM2.5 test results in a real environment on the left and a simulated stress test where the unit achieved an 80% filtration efficiency in a single pass.The graph on the right features data from a very high pollutant start-point used in testing conditions whereas the graph on the left simulates a more normal in-home situation as comparison. Both show the decrease is faster when the concentration of harmful particles is higher, so a heavily polluted room can be brought back to a safe level fast.The full test repot can be downloaded from our website here             Replacing the filter   To replace the silk matrix filter: 1) Lift off the glass lid, without removing the moss or coconut layers. These are specially designed to sit within the housing when you remove the top, so you don't need to fiddle with getting the material out.2) Open up the casing, which houses the existing filter. Again this should be specially fitted to the size of the unit, so you shouldn't need to touch the old used filter, then dispose of the old filter.3) Take out your new filter and place into the same housing, spreading out the pleats evenly and secure the lid, with the flaps on the inside of the box and the outsides of the new filter.4) Pop back on the glass lid, and you're done!

</h2><p>When choosing an outdoor power station, you expect it to function in all weather conditions, including icy cold winters. For most batteries that are made with LFP (LiFePO4) and others, cold temperatures can reduce performance and shorten the service life. That won’t happen with the ElecHive.<strong> </strong>In addition to the <strong>NMC battery’s ability to resist temperatures as low as -4°</strong>, the ElecHive has a specially developed, all-new thermal architecture with an <strong>interchangeable airflow temperature system to better heat up the battery in the winter </strong>when the temperature drops.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607232613/gtls8hphltg0cltfkc7n.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Recommended operating usage temperature from -4°F-104°F (-20°C-40°C)</u></p><p> </p><p style=""font-family: Verdana, Normal, Verdana;line-height: 35px;margin:18px 0px 10px;text-align: center;""><font color=""#ffffff""><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: 300;background-color: rgb(60, 120, 216);"">In the winter.</span></font></p><p>In the outdoors during winter, the battery temperature can fall significantly.

Once you buy one, you have to stock up on oil and gas and keep some on hand at all times. Not to mention the costly and time-consuming maintenance. Ultimately, you end up wasting a lot of time and money. Because of this, creating more convenient power storage solutions to replace traditional gas generators is becoming a trend.We brought you a solution!After we fulfilled the portable air conditioner, ZeroBreeze Mark 2 to our backers all over the world, we started thinking about what our next challenge should be. The answer was to create this super-portable power station that strengthens every element such as portability, power, quality, and of course, price.Introducing ElecHive 2200The ElecHive 2200 is a game-changer in the world of generators! Thanks to its advanced battery pack technology, the ElecHive 2200 has definitely reached the ultimate energy density for a product of its kind. This is very important because it means it's nearly impossible to find a product can have the same battery capacity at a smaller size. Its powerful battery can provide 2,200W of power output, just like a standard wall socket!  And it packs a massive 2,500Wh capacity, which means all your devices will stay powered for hours and hours, so you’ll never be stranded without power. Even with all of these features, it only weighs 34 pounds and is as small as a basketball.  Two major upgradesMake it stand out from the crowd.ElecHive 2200 has reached the technological height for products of its kind. While having all these great attributes, we have also brought the price down to the absolute affordable you can imagine for such performance. Hard to believe? Scroll down and allow us to prove it to you.When it came to comparison, we wanted to compare the ElecHive to the products of the top tier in the industry. So we chose this popular power-station: The Goal Zero YETI 1500X and Bluetti AC200. You can easily tell from the chart below that no matter the size, weight, capacity, or price the ElecHive 2200 has an overwhelming advantage in every category.Why is it so outstanding?It uses the latest battery tech.You may be wondering how our device is so much more advanced. This is because the integrated Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (LiNiMnCoO2) — NMC battery pack makes the size of the battery pack much smaller and lighter. Instead of joining 300 individual 18650 batteries together like a traditional power station, the ElecHive 2200 only has 6 batteries and connections between them. This system greatly reduces the risk of potential accidents to occur. Additionally, it is also much smaller than a traditional power station.While there is a downside on cost, the significant upside for NMC is energy density, which is nearly 30% - 50% more than LFP (LiFePO4) depending upon packaging. This means that to achieve the same capacity, the physical size of an LFP battery would need to be at least one third bigger – a concern in portable power sources where size is at a premium.ElecHive has made significant breakthroughs to stay powerful without compromising mobility and versatility. And you will no longer get frustrated because there is no enough space in your car to store things you want to bring camping. The compact nature of the ElecHive means you will never have to compromise storage space again. Every cubic ElecHive saved in your trunk translates to more space for your food and drinks.A mature battery tech for the future.As the demand for evolving performance priorities skyrocket in this decade, NMC(LiNiMnCoO2) batteries are becoming the common types of batteries used for electric vehicles and energy storage systems (EES) nowadays. Because of its low-temperature resistance, high energy density, high cycle efficiency, stable chemistry, and many of the good attributes, NMC batteries have been widely used in some high-end electric vehicles such as Tesla Model 3, BMW i8, Audi e-tron GE, etc… the safety and recyclability of NMC are recognized by the industry.Here is the list of vehicles that use NMC battery for reference. Portable power stations with 18650 batteries are now a thing of the past.Suitable For All Four Season
Supports external temperatures from -4℉ to 104℉
When choosing an outdoor power station, you expect it to function in all weather conditions, including icy cold winters. For most batteries that are made with LFP (LiFePO4) and others, cold temperatures can reduce performance and shorten the service life. That won’t happen with the ElecHive. In addition to the NMC battery’s ability to resist temperatures as low as -4°, the ElecHive has a specially developed, all-new thermal architecture with an interchangeable airflow temperature system to better heat up the battery in the winter when the temperature drops.Recommended operating usage temperature from -4°F-104°F (-20°C-40°C) In the winter.In the outdoors during winter, the battery temperature can fall significantly. When the thermal sensor detects the temperature has fallen below the default value of 32°F/0°C, the temperature-control module will change the airflow direction of the inverter’s internal heat and guide the warm downward to warm the battery pack. With the cold-resistant NMC batteries combined with the ElecHive’s interchangeable airflow temperature management system, using a power-station outdoors in an icy winter with high energy efficiency is no longer just a dream. In the summer.In a typical summer afternoon, when the device is turned on, heat is generated by the inverter, and fans turn on to release the heat from either side of the closed battery case. With several upgrades, including an optimized air duct, a more powerful fan, expanded vents, and a redesigned airflow, the ElecHive provides a more efficient & quieter cooldown (less than 30db). By adopting these new upgrades, our device is capable of battery output at a peak performance of 2200W in an external temperature of up to 104°F/40°C without overheating. If the internal temperature rises to the threshold, the ElecHive will immediately stop charging on its own for your safety. Some recent testing videos.Fulfills All Your Power Needswith its 2500Wh capacity & 2200W AC Output.The ElecHive’s advanced built-in battery pack system enables you to operate a number of heavy-duty outdoor appliances and tools (up to 2200W). With the ElecHive, traditional devices such as laptops, lights, CPAP machines, drones, TVs, and projectors can be powered for prolonged periods of time. It is also capable of running larger load devices such as saws, hairdryers, and even an electric car with ease.A typical circular saw requires 2,500 watts to start up (starting wattage) and 1,200 watts throughout operation (running wattage). With the ElecHive 2200, working with a circular saw is no problem. Voltage can exceed the maximum level to up to 2500W to carry out these substantial tasks. Power 12 Devices SimultaneouslyDon't be fooled by its small size. The ElecHive is equipped with five different port options, including fast-charging USB-C ports, USB-A ports, regular 12V DC ports, 110V AC ports, plus a specific 180W car charging port for the Zero Breeze Mark 2 Air Conditioner. It can power a wide range of devices and appliances like power tools, medical devices, and home appliances including full-size refrigerators. The Meaningful IndicatorsEH2200's real-time display shows current, voltage, power, temperature, and charging status. Users can easily aware of the output voltage, battery capacity, hours to empty/full, charging mode, etc.110V-240V SupportedWe support all socket types worldwide (110V-240V), and you can select the type you prefer in the perk checkout menu.Customize Your Preference through Control Panel(1) AC Output Frequency (50Hz / 60Hz)You can easily adjust ElechHive2200’s output frequency to be adaptive for the local incompatible power grids between 50Hz and 60 Hz (AC standard frequencies).(2) Maximum Charge Protection (90% / 100%)To better protect and extend the battery life cycle, ElecHive allows you to set the battery maximum charging saturation to be either 100% or 90%.(3) DC Output Method (ALWAYS ON / AUTO OFF)EH2200 allows you to choose the DC output method to be either always on or auto-off. ALWAYS ON mode allows continuous power output. It can be used for low-load devices like refrigerators, air fans, etc. AUTO OFF mode ensures the best energy-saving and extends your battery life in most.  (4) AC Output Method (ALWAYS ON / AUTO OFF)EH2200 allows you to choose the AC output method to be either always on or auto-off. ALWAYS ON mode allows continuous power output. It can be used for low-load devices like refrigerators, air fans, etc. AUTO OFF mode ensures the best energy-saving and extends your battery life in most. (5) Buzzer (ON / OFF)Easily turned on and off for the buzzer alarm by the switch. EH2200 comes with a built-in buzzer that generally alerts any abnormal state of the machine such as overload protection, low-temperature protection and high-temperature protection. Dust-proof Cover DesignSome devices might not have been mentioned above, so we have listed more below:You can even charge your Tesla.You can even use it as an emergency backup for powering your electric vehicles up to 10 extra miles on a single charge. Or use it as backup power for medical devices.For those dependent on medical equipment, a power outage can bring things into chaos.

This provides for superior electrical and thermal conductivity, high flexibility, high strength, and low weight. Graphene batteries are lighter and slimmer than their lithium-ion counterparts with boasting over 5x power capacity per kilogram. Lastly, Graphene batteries are some of the safest batteries on the market, more resistant to heat, punctures, and drops. ScoutPro has roughly the same footprint as an iPhone 12 Max.  In this small package we've packed graphene batteries, MagSafe and Apple Watch compatible magnets, 200w mainboard, premium aircraft grade aluminum housing, and wireless charging board.  For power output, both USB-C ports on the ScoutPro can output the following; 5V / 3A, 9V / 3A, 12V / 3A, 15V / 3A or 20V / 5A.  The QC USB-A port supports 24W Quick Charge (Huawei Super Charge port), yes 24W! in addition to 5V / 4.5A, 9V / 2A or 12V / 2A.The Wireless Charging panels support up to 15W wireless charging and Apple & Samsung Watch Charging.   When we say ScoutPro can charge just about anything, we mean it.  Simply add-on our available adapters and you can transform the included Type-C cable into a laptop charging cable.  Our friendly support team can assist you in determining which adapter is best for your needs.   If you’ve ever used other brick powerbanks, in the past, you’ve no doubt noticed output is rapidly throttled when charging.  You may start charging at high-power, but it quickly drops down.  Not with ScoutPro!  Our next gen chip batteries and architecture ensures an industry leading steady 100w output until the batteries are drained to 30-40%.  Note, ScoutPro will slow down the output if temperatures start getting too hot, however simply let ScoutPro cool down and you’ll be right back at 100W. When we set out to develop ScoutPro in 2019, our goal was to make an incredibly portable AND powerful power station that could charge anything you threw at it. Our required features were;
Enough power to charge any laptop
Smartphone fast charge compatible
Universal wireless charging
Smart watch charging
Passthrough charging
Fast recharging
Airline carry-on friendly
Batteries that could last at least 2000 charge cycles
 Early Sketch Early RenderTo develop ScoutPro, we partnered with an engineering & development firm to take our concepts and turn them into a reality.  Our firm helped us source from existing raw materials, customized chips, and identify the perfect batteries to create a powerbank with our unique features & functionality.  The initial prototypes and handmade samples accomplished all our initial goals.We've put ScoutPro through countless hours of lab and real world testing, all so we can be sure you're getting the absolute world's best power bank.In early 2020, COVID put a pause on development. During this break, Apple introduced MagSafe charging and we decided we could do even better, adding support for 200w of PD with PPS charging, MagSafe Charging, Samsung Watch Charging, and an additional 4000mAh of power (bringing the total to 24000mAh).Supporting simultaneous iPhone 12 Max & Apple Watch charging, MagSafe support, and increasing the capacity required us to develop a new, slightly larger mold. This also required a new circuit design and updated chipset. 3D Printed Mold Of ScoutPro With MagSafe Charging Added  Updated Wireless Charge Controller With MagSafe Magnets CAD Drawing Of Updated Molding New Custom Mold With Expanded Power, MagSafe Charging, Samsung Watch Charging *Production ScoutPro will be black Hands On Video With ScoutPro After launching our campaign, we had an overwhelming request to replace our charge indicator with a digital display.

 You can purchase LEOCH with complete confidence as it eclipses other battery powered technology. LEOCH is equipped with the latest LiFePO4 battery - next generation Lithium batteries that are the safest on the market. Being the most stable of modern batteries, they do not overheat, and even if punctured when being recharged, will not catch on fire. The cathode material in LiFePO4 batteries is non-hazardous so you can have confidence that there are no hazards to your health or the environment.Meanwhile, as well as being safe and durable, LEOCH provides a higher than average capacity of power for its size.Exclusive to our INDIEGOGO backers, we are offering a 2-year warranty! LiFePO4 batteries are characterized by high safety, high rate charge-discharge characteristics and long cycle life. LiFePO4 batteries also have stable charge-discharge characteristics and good fast charge characteristics. In addition to long life and excellent charge-discharge performance, the greatest advantage of LiFePO4 batteries is its safety.   Yes, we said 13! That’s how many devices LEOCH can handle with absolute ease! Don’t underestimate its portable size. This generator definitely has the ‘unprecedented’ factor!  Inside the tough aluminum alloy casing, the 2,048 watt battery is securely embedded, offering two regular USB ports, two fast charging USB ports, two PD USB-C ports and four international AC wall outlets - as well as a car charging outlet!  LEOCH isn’t just a backup power supply – it’s a workhorse! As a powerful generator in its own right (with 4x 2,000W AC output and surge at 4,000W), LEOCH keeps devices running – from household appliances to workshop tools and vital equipment, like CPAP machines and your electric car! Just plug in and you are ready to go. We offer different versions of AC outlets to suit different countries and regions.Speed up your journey by using LEOCH as an emergency backup for powering your electric vehicles. It provides a reassuring 10.5 extra miles on a single charge. Is your workshop underpowered? Are you putting in some hours on an outdoor project? With LEOCH, no matter how intensive your power usage, you have all the grunt you need to run any equipment. For example, most electric drills are rated between 5 and 10 amps, which equals 600 and 1200 watts respectively without load. Now you can run your electric drill, LEOCH style, for up to 3.5 hours, Welders too!We designed LEOCH to be compact, easy to manoeuvre (comes with wheels), so you can take it with you anywhere.  And there are no bulky adapters - one AC input cable is all you need for when you want to recharge. LEOCH is user-friendly technology at its very best!For those who rely on medical devices such like a CPAP machine or a medical fridge, a power outage could be a disaster. Most CPAP machines are between 30-60 Watts. With LEOCH, you’re always well prepared for the unexpected and you can relax in the knowledge that your CPAP will continue to work for the next 34-68 hours. Being without power, or without continuous power, is a serious matter. The electronic devices you rely on every day for communications, security and entertainment are at risk as a result of unexpected blackouts, voltage fluctuations or other power disruptions. When the power is out or beyond safe levels, LEOCH’s Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), instantly provides backup power, as well as surge protection, for all your plug-in equipment.The UPS provides continuous power and protection for your connected electronic devices including Computers, Televisions, Security Systems, Gaming Consoles and Mobile Devices.At the same time, independent charging and discharging circuit modules allow LEOCH to charge and recharge simultaneously. Power outages are always inconvenient and rarely prepared for, but LEOCH is! LEOCH is your powerful yet quiet, backup plan AND it’s maintenance-free! When you need your home appliances to just work - which is always - LEOCH will power them for you anytime, all the time.  So your all-important appliances stay on - your Refrigerator, Coffee Maker, Electric Grill, Electric tools, even your Tesla. Just as LEOCH is simple to operate, it is also simple to recharge, in one of three easy methods:  300W AC input, 300W solar input, 300W external charger, and 150W DC input (through an Anderson outlet). You can recharge LEOCH from a combination of power sources and, with its rapid recharge capability, it can be recharged to 80% in around 3 hours. Via a regular AC input LEOCH can be charged safely and easily and, unlike other battery generators, LEOCH does not have a bulky adapter to plug in.  A major advantage of alternating current is that its voltage can be modified relatively easily using a transformer, which allows power to be transmitted at very high voltages before being taken down to safer voltages for commercial and residential use. DC input is the most stable and simple way of charging a battery station when you prepare a backup power for your home or your adventures. Whilst charging LEOCH via AC input is convenient, the effectiveness of charging via a DC output is much higher, which opens up many more possibilities for utilizing LEOCH’s extensive capabilities. When there is no place to plug in, you can charge LEOCH with 100% green solar power and at the same time help to save the planet by producing 0 emissions. Sunlight is a renewable clean energy that is available every day. Even on cloudy days, solar power can be captured by LEOCH at decent levels. The additional charging port uses the Cannon connector designed with a maximum power of 300W. To achieve the maximum 600W solar input, two sets of 300W solar panels/inputs are required to charge separately. Please beware you can also charge LEOCH at 900W through all three ports using Solar & AC input.    Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a tracking technology in electronic form. It uses algorithms and controls circuits to search for the maximum power point, so that the converter circuit can obtain the maximum power from the cell module.LEOCH has solar inputs via Anderson outlet, which are compatible with the majority of solar panels in the market. Through solar input, LEOCH can be recharged to 80% in around 3.4 hours, while you can rest assured that it is completely eco-friendly.LEOCH is compatible with other solar panels and installations on the market which means you can fully utilize other solar power systems and store that energy in LEOCH for future use.With LEOCH, you can power almost everything – at home and at work, in case of a blackout – as well as when you decide to go off the beaten path for an adventure. And when you need to recharge LEOCH you can utilize the portable solar panel, or hook it up directly to your existing solar system. LEOCH is your reliable partner in the great outdoors, as a generator that gives you peace of mind, or the ability to live a completely green lifestyle. The 2,048Wh LiFePO4 battery pack is embedded in a durable aluminum alloy housing and protected by reinforced ABS+PC shed. LEOCH is built to be tough and secure. Now you’re worry-free, knowing LEOCH will always be with you.An intelligent BMS protects your LEOCH from power surges and overheating, monitoring and alerting you of any sharp changes in temperature.LEOCH is equipped with LiFePO4 batteries along with its state-of-the-art BMS which can give you all the benefits above and protect all the cells. It can protect every battery cell group from taking too much/too little load, so as to maximize the batterie life and performance. There is air inlet and air outlet setup at two side ends of closed battery case. Fans are installed at air inlet and air outlet. Thus, temperature controlled module, fans and circuit core form an electric loop. When temperature inside battery case exceeds default value, the temperature-controlled module will control operation of fan, guiding heat air to be exhausted from the battery case. LEOCH’s durability and reliability makes it a trustworthy partner in even the worst of blackouts. LEOCH has over 40 international certificates as both a manufacturer and as a product that has an impressive number of safety features, such as Short-Circuit Protection, Battery Overcharge Protection, Output Overcharge Protection, Harsh Temperature Protection, and more.     Made from a shell of waterproof oxford cloth, the solar panel is highly durable and able to be folded into a tiny size, making it light and portable.

GoSun Chillest is the ultimate outdoor cooler because instead of using ice, it cools food and drinks using the power of the Sun. The 45 Liter cooler prepares you for any outdoor event with a built-in battery and all-terrain wheels plus thoughtful extras like inside lighting, tie down straps and organization baskets. It also has a built-in compressor that lets you set the temperature right where you want it with a range from -4°F to 68°F (-20°C to 20°C). Without ice, you can use 100% of the cooler's volume. GoSun Chillest has nearly double the room for food and drinks when compared with coolers of equal dimensions!Cool and freeze anything you want for hours without using ANY ICE. The Chillest doesn’t just chill your food and drinks, it keeps them frozen! Can you please grab the ice cream??The dual cooling zones mean you have a freezer and fridge in the same device. You can set the temperature for each side anywhere from -4°F to 68°F (-20°C to 20°C) using the included App and touch buttons. You’ll enjoy the coldest beer in camp and frozen ice cream ready for dessert.Hello there, we are GoSun.We create solar products that let you enjoy the outdoors more. We’ve launched and delivered 8 products through crowdfunding and in 2019, we launched our biggest success yet: a first-of-its-kind solar cooler called the GoSun Chill. Thousands of happy customers loved it so much that we got their feedback to make a cooler that’s even better.When it comes to powering your Chillest, you have 4 options: its built-in battery, an external power bank, AC or DC and Solar. This way, you can access the most convenient power source whether you’re barbequing in your backyard or deep in the woods.10 hours of power for one day packed with fun. Charge it up the night before and it’s ready for the beach, boat, tailgate and more!Enjoy unlimited power for your chillest when you plug it into an AC or DC outlet. Our all-electric, brushless DC compressor uses a third of the energy of typical thermo-electric coolers, making it an ideal refrigeration solution for your car, boat, camper van, RV or tiny house.Our Power 266 portable power bank gives your Chillest 30 additional hours of power with one full charge keeping your cooler cool for 40+ hours when combined with the Chillest’s built-in battery.Solar gives you extended refrigeration for your long adventures. Attach the GoSun Elbow Solar Table right to your Chillest for a usable surface to play cards, serve food, or use it as a desk, all while powering your cooler!The GoSun Chillest comes with a mount so you can attach the 20 watt solar table directly to the cooler.We’ve had enough with ice, so we reinvented the cooler to do what it was designed to do—keep your food and drinks cool without the hassle and mess, and let you make the most of your outdoor fun.GoSun Chillest is literally a refrigerator and freezer on wheels. It gets so cold you can actually make your own ice, and ice-free cooling means all your snacks stay dry and organized.There are other portable fridges out there, but they’re built for staying inside a vehicle. GoSun builds portable products that power themselves with the Sun, or plug into household AC, 12V and power banks so you can stay outside longer.Using solar and energy transfer technology, GoSun Chillest uses one third the energy of traditional portable fridges. The Chillest applies an all-electric brushless DC compressor instead of the more commonly used thermo-electric coolers - which are terribly inefficient.Our efficient brushless DC compressor draws only 45 watts of power - letting it keep your goods cool without using too much energy. GoSun Chillest is also completely quiet, fully controllable and very durable.GoSun Chillest was designed to make transporting all your gear easier.Integrated side handles and a dry weight of 42 LBS (19kg) make it easy to load the Chillest into the car. The telescopic handle makes pulling it along possible, even for kids!Your Chillest comes with two organizing baskets so you can pack it full but still find items on the bottom without unloadingThe Chillest has inside lighting so you can find exactly what you’re looking for at night or during a power outage.Prep your meal on the GoSun Chillest cutting board that lives inside the cooler lid. When you need to use it, it pops out and docks onto the top of the lid.GoSun Chillest comes equipped with a mount where you can slide in the umbrella or Elbow Solar Table, making it a complete relaxation or food prep station.Keep chilling in your hammock, tent or by the grill—you can control the Chillest’s temperature settings right from your phone with the complementary App!Nothing enhances time outside like some tunes! Our optional bluetooth speaker kicks out amazing sound while connecting to your smartphone from up to 50 feet away!Create an oasis of chill with the Slide-In Sun Umbrella that attaches right to your Chillest or comes with a sand anchor so you can park it at the beach.⛱️The outdoors is where we go to reset and reconnect. Feel the grass under your feet, jump in the water or play your favorite sport—we could all use more quality time in nature and that’s the core reason we built the GoSun Chillest.Anytime you spend more than three hours outside, you need refreshments at a minimum, but who has time to go buy ice for their grimy old cooler? It starts melting immediately!GoSun Chillest inspires you to get outdoors more by giving you a hassle-free way to bring all your drinks, snacks and outdoor necessities. And when you’re all done? There’s virtually no cleanup with this cooler. Remove what you didn’t use and charge the battery so you can do it all over again tomorrow.Rain or shine, GoSun gives you the ultimate portable fridge to enjoy the outdoors more.If you already have a GoSun Solar Panel or solar setup, this package is for you. The Chillest Base package comes with one GoSun Chillest Cooler and all its integrated features, including: tie downs, free app, dual cooling zones, inside lighting, 87wh built-in battery, cutting board, bottle opener, accessory pouch, waste bag hooks, mount for umbrella or table, wheels and telescope handle.Get everything in the Chillest Base plus our GoSun Elbow Solar Table that extends the life of your Chillest's internal battery. 20 watt solar table that attaches right onto your cooler and extends your refrigeration time by 5+ hours.You can’t have an outside outing without tunes!

It uses a high-precision laser sensor to track even the smallest detectable particles in your air. Unlike other air purifiers, OneLife X produces no harmful ozone and has no costly filters to replace. To say Onelife X is the best air purifier to hit the market would be an understatement—it’s the future of air purification! Our next-generation air purifying plasma filter eliminates 99.99% of airborne particles without the need to replace the filter, ever.OneLife X uses a high-precision laser sensor that detects particles as small as 1 micrometer, then the plasma technology removes particles down to 0.01 micrometers, meaning it removes even viruses and ultrafine particles out of your breathing air that most purifiers miss.Most air purifiers use standard HEPA filters that are incapable of capturing particles smaller than 0.3 micrometer. OneLife X has metallic plates in the filter that act like giant magnets for all the pollutants in the air. When air is pulled into the device, it passes through the plasma field where pollution particles get charged up (ionized) so they stick right to the collector sheets.Using this plasma field to ionize the particles instead of forcing air through a thick filter means there's no restriction of airflow, so One Life X requires very little energy, runs virtually silently, and generates no harmful ozone.   The independent lab test by IUTA shows that “OneLife X can provide per hour, on average, about 121 cubic meters of air free of particles, including viruses and small exhaled droplets that are potentially virus-laden. The filtration efficiency for larger exhaled droplets is even larger, resulting in a CADR of 131 cubic meters per hour.”The independent lab also tested for Ozone Emission. IUTA concluded that OneLife X does NOT add ozone to the room even after 60 minutes of constant purification. The lab stated: “The amount of emitted ozone lies with (1.6 ± 1.8) ppb substantially below the limit of 50 ppb specified by UL 867-37.”In the graph below you see the ozone concentration as a black line (with the OneLife X running full speed) and a red line (the natural background levels of ozone that are always present). They are almost identical and far lower than the officially accepted concentration of ozone in a room.HEPA? No thanks—sounds like a bad infection.The OneLife X plasma filter never needs to be replaced. It’s washable and dishwasher safe, meaning it won’t pollute the environment with non-recyclable plastics and filter waste.This is as sustainable and affordable as it gets.Other air purifiers use pricey HEPA filters that need to be changed often and cost more to operate. HEPA technology hasn't been updated in more than 70 years!OneLife X delivers the highest purification performance with the lowest energy consumption. At just 6 watts, it consumes less than an average LED lamp! This means you get the most clinically clean air while saving money on energy bills.Other air purifiers cost $30-120 per year because they require a high-speed fan to press air through fibreglass mats inside the air filter. High-speed fans and pressure means loud, disrupting noise levels plus increased energy consumption, resulting in higher energy bills.Our technology purifies the air without restricting airflow, so it doesn't need high-energy fan pressure. This enables us to run the fan at a super low ventilation rate, making the purifier absolutely silentIt’s so quiet you can run it right next to your bed—try that with a HEPA filter! OneLife X looks and feels like a piece of furniture. Our team of designers crafted OneLife X to fit effortlessly and beautifully into any modern-day home or office. Plus, it operates standing or laying flat, so it fits in any space.The textile cover is made from recycled PET plastic bottles, keeping that discarded plastic out of landfills and from breaking down into microplastics that can cause serious health issues. OneLife X’s renewable filter design makes it the most sustainable filter on the market, purifying your air while protecting the plant.OneLife X alerts you when it is time to wash the filter, and has three air-purifying modes:OneLife X provides clinically pure air exactly where you want it with a tilt feature that lets you deliver clean-air immediately within your personal air space.The OneLife X app gives you detailed data on indoor air quality and outdoor pollutants so you can monitor your air quality from anywhere, effortlessly.Plus, the app lets you input your personal air purification needs (like if you have asthma, allergies or pets) and OneLife X adjusts its settings automatically! In addition to measuring pollutants in your air, OneLife X also measures temperature and humidity.The OneLife X app displays indoor AND outdoor air quality levels using the BreezoMeter. By getting the live outdoor pollution data from local air quality indices (AQIs), we are able to recommend if the air quality is good enough for your outdoor activities or for you to open the windows. The average human takes 17,000 breaths a day and inhales 2,000 gallons of air. Pure air is for everyone—and so is OneLife X.*Add a carbon filter to your OneLife X to ensure that in addition to all the particles, all odors get absorbed from your air. Gases will get trapped and retained inside the activated carbon to provide you with clean air without any bad odors. New to Indiegogo? No problem. Follow these simple steps to get your own OneLife X.At the end of the campaign, we’ll send you a survey to get your shipping information and deliver your OneLife X when manufacturing is complete! Our story started over five years ago in Germany. We’re a team of scientists, engineers and dreamers who recognized that the air that we breathe is harming our health—and no health tech company was going to fix it (they just love their business models around filter replacement too much to upgrade the technology).So we started OneLife X with one simple goal: to create clean air with a clear conscience.

But what if you're camping, or preparing for a power outage, and you need a simple way to charge over a dozen products, including heavy-duty appliances?We think situations like this should be just as easy to navigate. That's why we made SuperBase Pro. SuperBase Pro is designed for portability and peace of mind. Let's talk about a few of the reasons you'll love SuperBase Pro.




 


No one likes waiting around for their power station to charge up before going on an adventure. SuperBase Pro can be charged up to 80% in just one hour.With our patented GridFlow technology, you can charge SuperBase Pro 2000 at up to 1,800W from an adequate AC outlet or generator. A full charge is just two hours away. GridFlow unlocks superfast charging potential by taking advantage of Integrated AC Direct Charging (IACDC) using a Texas Instruments processor.If green energy is your thing, SuperBase Pro 2000 can handle solar arrays of any size up to 1,800W. Our patented PVMax tech means your solar setup can charge SuperBase Pro 2000 with the same superfast performance you'd get from conventional charging. That's one hour for an 80% charge, and two hours for a full charge.PVMax is a patented protocol utilizing High Voltage Solar Technology (HVST) conversion to deliver up to 1,800W from solar arrays that provide 60-160V. SuperBase Pro 2000 comes with an MC4 to AC female cable, so setup is really simple.You can also charge SuperBase Pro 2000 using solar DC power at up to 600W. We use the latest MPPT technology, enabled by a Texas Instruments processor, so SuperBase Pro 2000 can be charged at 12-60V, up to 600W, through the XT60 port.Want even more speed? If you hook SuperBase Pro 2000 up to a wall outlet and a solar array at the same time, you could get up to 2,400W of charging power. There's fast, and then there's fast.At home, SuperBase Pro 2000 has you covered. With 2,000W of AC output and 4,000W surge capability, you can power your microwave, washing machine, coffee maker, or other essentials around the house, worry-free.If you like camping, you'll love SuperBase Pro 2000's 2,096Wh capacity. Use your off-grid camping gear for hours on end. SuperBase Pro 2000 is the perfect power solution for on-the-go events. Devices such as laptops, led lamps, drones, mini fridges and projectors can be powered by it for a prolonged period.SuperBase Pro 2000 can even be an emergency backup for your Starlink and electric vehicle. According to our test, SuperBase Pro 2000 can add an extra 12 km for a Tesla Model 3. What's more, SuperBase Pro 2000 can also be recharged at any EV charging station up to 1800W, 80% in an hour using our EV-AC adapter.While SuperBase Pro's maximum output is 2,000W, it can power devices that typically need up to 3,000W, thanks to the AmpUp feature. This means SuperBase Pro is even compatible with heavy-duty appliances and power tools.AmpUp* is our patented Dynamic Voltage Output technology. When power-hungry devices need a high starting current, AmpUp can lower the output voltage to compensate, allowing for higher current at the same output power. And since a pure sine wave output is maintained, it's completely safe.*AmpUp is enabled through SuperBase Pro 2000's companion app. Device compatibility may vary.An unexpected blackout can be a huge headache. If you're working on your computer, you could lose important progress. Even worse, a sudden power interruption can actually damage sensitive electrical equipment.That's why SuperBase Pro has household grade Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS*) functionality built right in. And it's super easy to use. Just connect SuperBase Pro 2000 to a power outlet, connect your essential devices to SuperBase Pro 2000, and you're done. If the power goes out, SuperBase Pro will switch over to battery power automatically.*UPS is applicable to electrical appliances below 2,000W.With industrial-grade wheels, a telescopic aluminum handle, and a low center of gravity, SuperBase Pro is designed with ""anytime, anywhere"" in mind. And as you're rolling it across the terrain, you'll find that it's sturdy enough to stack another item on top if you need to.The ridges along the top and back aren't just for looks. Zendure has a reputation for durable products, and SuperBase Pro is no exception. The outer shell is shock resistant, and the interior is reinforced against collisions, making SuperBase Pro a rugged and reliable outdoor companion.Are 14 output ports too many? We didn't bother to ask when we designed SuperBase Pro. Better to have them than to need them.And these aren't vanity ports. Case in point: SuperBase Pro's 100W USB-C ports can charge a power-hungry 16"" MacBook Pro at the same speed that users are already accustomed to, without the need to carry around a proprietary power brick.SuperBase Pro's 6.1"" display shows real-time information about power usage, remaining charge, environmental conditions, and so much more.SuperBase Pro 2000’s battery can run 3,000 cycles to 60% capacity, or 1,500 cycles to 80% capacity.  It uses the most advanced EV-grade NMC batteries, which have been widely used in high-end electric vehicles. The high energy density and stable performance of NMC batteries offer high capacity in a compact package.Another new member of the SuperBase Pro series, SuperBase Pro 1500, uses LiFePo4 batteries to achieve longer life cycles with a large 1,456Wh capacity. This unit can run 6,000 cycles to 60% capacity, or 3,000 cycles to 80% capacity.Some power stations on the market have controls that can only be accessed when you're physically near the device using Bluetooth or a direct Wi-Fi connection. That's very limiting. What if you're using it remotely, and you want to check its status? What if you want to track the position of your power station to protect against theft?Fortunately, SuperBase Pro has built-in GPS and 4G IoT (Internet of Things) hardware, so as long as you've got a 4G signal, you can manage your power station from anywhere. Check the location, remaining charge, and output power of your SuperBase Pro, all in real time.SuperBase Pro supports Wi-Fi network connection as well as direct connection using the built in Wi-Fi module. So even if there's no Wi-Fi network available, you'll still have easy access to your SuperBase Pro through the app. When you buy SuperBase Pro, you get a free year of 4G service, which works in 120 countries. That's a $99 value!Amazing hardware deserves equally amazing software. Theft protection and remote status updates are just the tip of the iceberg. Our companion app for SuperBase Pro gives you remote control, location services, and access to lots of advanced features. Here are just a few of the things you can do with the app:Our goal is to provide the best possible user experience and the best possible performance with our products, so we're constantly innovating. That innovation shouldn't stop after you receive your SuperBase Pro. That's why our new power station supports Over The Air updates (OTA).Zendure is committed to making our planet better for the next generation. As a direct competitor to fuel-powered generators, SuperBase Pro is already a green-energy product. But we knew we could go even further. Now, environmentalism isn't just in our DNA; it's also in our source code.When you use green energy, you're reducing the amount of carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. SuperBase Pro keeps track of your carbon reduction and puts that data into your personal ZenForest. You can compare your green energy use with friends across the globe.But your ZenForest isn't just some pixels on a screen. As you collect carbon reduction points in the app, real trees will be planted around the world on your behalf. We're working with OneTreePlanted.org to make this happen. With your help, we're hoping to plant 10 million trees by 2025.With so much power and so many features, SuperBase Pro has a lot going on under the hood. That's why we used the best components we could get our hands on.Patented Power Management System: converts DC to AC, and AC to DC in the most efficient way, with an overload protection switch and a clear ground indicator.Intelligent Temperature-Activated Fan: keeps SuperBase Pro cool, further protecting the battery.Solid Craftsmanship: SuperBase Pro was designed to have a low center of gravity, mitigating rollover risk. The industrial wheels and aerospace-grade aluminum drawbar are built to handle difficult terrain.Advanced BMS (Battery Management System)CertificationHigh EfficiencyOur solar panel uses advanced technology to soak up as much sunlight as possible. New-generation monocrystalline solar cells maximize the conversion efficiency, performing up to 22.5% better than similarly rated polycrystalline solar panels in low-light conditions. It also has an adjustable kickstand to put the panel at the ideal angle for maximum yield.Portable, Durable, and Waterproof IP67We wanted to make sure our solar panel could keep up with SuperBase Pro. This meant it had to be easy to carry around, but also built to withstand the elements, as well as the hazards of travel. Whether it's folded up for transport and storage, or unfurled and ready for action, our solar panel is a rugged and capable companion for any outdoor excursion.Strength in NumbersIf you want even more power, our solar panel can be connected in series with other solar panels. SuperBase Pro can charge at up to 1,800W. You can assemble your own solar array for maximum charging performance!*50HZ is the default setting.SuperBase Pro is a fully developed product, and pilot production has already begun. With your support, we can do our first round of mass production and get SuperBase Pro out into the world.Zendure is an outdoor electronics company based in Silicon Valley in the US and the Greater Bay Area in China.

<p>This crazy journey started out as a passion project and turned into a business that we are incredibly passionate about. Founded in 2019 by Elliott Bennett, Kyle Wyche, and Dylan Lew, our mission addresses the ever-growing issue of food waste and the best way to process it for the environment and our communities. Our first system we call the<strong> </strong><i>Seahorse</i><strong>,</strong> is a sustainable and environmentally conscious solution where we leverage anaerobic digestion technology to provide a closed-loop solution. To date, our first Seahorse system has successfully processed over 20,000 pounds of food waste, diverting 80,000 pounds of CO2 equivalent to produce electricity and organic liquid plant fertilizer.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Going into the winter months, we know how difficult it is to keep your plants alive and healthy, but Soil Sauce can help. With this campaign, we are testing the market for our Soil Sauce. We are interested in the feedback on a national scale. To date, we've been selling jars at a local farmers' market, however, Indiegogo gives us a chance to prove demand for a national market.</p>
<p>As we mentioned in the video, our goal is to build a herd of Seahorse systems across the country but it all starts here. The profits from this campaign will go towards funding our next Seahorse system. While we have a presumptive list for our next system location, we plan to weigh in the interest and support generated by this campaign to help determine its location. Who knows...maybe the next one will be in your neighborhood. A new unit costs about $55,000 so we are hoping for the best!</p>
<p>Check out the perks we came up with just for you. We have stretch goals and secret perks waiting to be shared as well :)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632834259/yqqv6iyudzycynclxqgd.png"" src=""""/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our Seahorse solution is impactful and the reason is twofold. </p>
<p>1. <strong>WASTE: </strong>All the food that you would typically throw away is being repurposed. It is no longer rotting in our landfills, taking up space, filling our air with carbon dioxide and methane gas. It is turned into something useful, all while reducing carbon emissions and literally creating energy!</p>
<p>2. <strong>NO BAD RUNOFF:</strong> Fertilizer can be dangerous. In fact, many farms are not certified organic based on the fertilizer they use. The organic Soil Sauce is jam-packed with nutrients and healthy microbes which improve the long-term soil health for your land, animals, and you. You can use it on your indoor plants and outdoor garden! Additional areas of use for Soil Sauce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydroponics (3-6% concentration)</li>
<li>Indoor and outdoor plants (diluted for 5x the volume!)</li>
<li>Compost accelerator poured on top of your compost pile</li>
</ul>
<p>See for yourself!</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know our system can only produce about 2,600 gallons of Soil Sauce per year. This presents a challenge. If this campaign does better than we expect, production and shipping becomes more complicated. Ideally, we are aiming to deliver all rewards prior to the holiday season. We have two backup plans:</p>
<p>1. Start capping rewards to assure timely delivery</p>
<p>2. Open up a second round of shipment dates which will take us into the spring</p>
<p>It is also very challenging to meet any sales goal when our product cost is not very large. This is why we are hoping that people are willing to buy multiple packs of Soil Sauce for multiple months of use, which will help us reach our goal faster and prove product demand.</p>

If this campaign does better than we expect, production and shipping becomes more complicated. Ideally, we are aiming to deliver all rewards prior to the holiday season. We have two backup plans:
1. Start capping rewards to assure timely delivery
2. Open up a second round of shipment dates which will take us into the spring
It is also very challenging to meet any sales goal when our product cost is not very large. This is why we are hoping that people are willing to buy multiple packs of Soil Sauce for multiple months of use, which will help us reach our goal faster and prove product demand.

Meet the Team
Hi! We are Elliott, Kyle and Dylan. We've been working on Ecotone Renewables since 2019 and are very excited to begin this next stage of expansion! We would also be remiss if we did not mention our team of wonderful interns that have been helping us all year long and our mentors who, for years, have been a pillar in our company.
We thank you for supporting our campaign and we are excited to get to know all of you!",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

Larger balancing machines are possible but 4"" of X position travel to effect balancing is plenty to begin with.Nikola Tesla was using this method over 100 years ago. It is worth replicating this apparatus to investigate whether his method may not have taken off commercially, due to it being TOO GOOD! If you have a product that lasts a very long time, it won't need to be replaced with a new one for a very long time! The link above will take you to a word searchable version of Tesla's final British Patent on Tesla Universe. For those who wish to read the original, here is British Patent 186,799 submitted in 1921 and approved in 1922. It was Nikola Tesla's final British patent ever. What a finale!I think that apart from a superior dynamic balance, the rotors will be more aesthetically pleasing when balanced using Tesla's method rather than the modern digital weight removal method. Tesla's method is also less likely to introduce any turbulence and removes minimal material to achieve a balance in 3 planes (static 1 plane) and dynamic (2 planes).Rotors balanced using modern digital method and ugly weight removal using ball nose toolThe plan is to design and manufacture a replication of Tesla's balancing apparatus and then I will personally balance all the rotors using Tesla's patent method.Tesla's original balancing method using ugly drilled holes in end plates to remove weight circa 1909I had several issues with balancing companies in the past, the first two let me down. The third one has done the best they can using the equipment they have, but even still it isn't up to Tesla's standard and costs £120 for each rotor because of the time taken for the job.New Carbon Fibre Compressor Rotor on High Tensile Super Duplex ShaftIf the Indiegogo campaign is successful, the plan is to have the balancing apparatus designed and manufactured locally by the trusted rapid prototyping engineering company I use. YouTuber Rob Meades has been testing various types of air bearing in the background using one of my previous designs, that I hadn't actually tested myself. His progress is looking highly promising to remove the ultra high speed ceramic bearing requirement and therefore the lubrication service requirement too!Rob Meades using graphite xy bearing design with o-rings. No Thrust bearing in place.I am confident Tesla's analogue dynamic balancing method is superior to any being offered by digital dynamic balancing services today.  This is due to the process of aligning the centre of balance and centre of symmetry using weight removal, whilst the rotor is being spun at a harmonic of the resonant frequency (critical speed) of the rotor.3 x Different Compressor Rotors For Balancing Using Tesla's MethodDigital balancing companies do not recommend running a rotor at the critical speed (resonant point), whereas Tesla's method this is okay.""As a crucial test the operator may then run the rotor at about the critical speed. This should cause no appreciable vibration or effect on the balance indicator which, instead of carrying a weight, may be equipped with a spring for producing the required pressure on the ball-bearing and opposing the torsion."" Just to give you an idea of the cost of made to order miniature rotor digital balancing machines:£6k Chinese Micro Rotor Balancing MachineJP Balancer PRS-0.3 £60k German Micro Rotor Balancing MachineSchenck Pasio 5 Balancer £110k English Laser Removal Micro Rotor Balancing Machine The laser removal costs £240 per rotor and requires an assembly with an unknown cost that will allow the rotor to be rotated in its bearings whilst being balanced. I would like to offer balancing machines for sale in the near future but until this one is designed, manufactured and tested I have no batch price, as some minor changes might be made to the design once tested. However, if you would like to be first in the queue with a £500 deposit on a Nikola Tesla Analogue Dynamic Balancer there is a Perc for that.I'm really looking forward to balancing all the rotors using this method. I have studied the patent for nearly 3 years and longed to build one.I plan to use an off the shelf Dremel 3000 for item 4 (Motor) in the diagram.Dremel 3000 Also a carborundum grinding wheel as Tesla suggests for item 3 (Carborundum Abrasive Grinding).Carborundum (Silicon Carbide) Grinding Wheel Carborundum is also known as Silicon Carbide.This material pops up now and again in Tesla's work. Interesting how it is now used as a semi conductor. A proper slide and lathe mechanism will be used to effect x and y movement in controllable increments. Items 5, 6, 7 & 8. The SKF bearings were selected for the job as they do not require a preload or spring washers. The bearings will be mounted in rubber rings with a low shore hardness. These rubber rings will be changeable for lower / harder shore hardness rings until the most suitable shore hardness is found. This will serve as parts 17, 18, 19 and 20. A special circular bore two part balancing specific casing which I am designing for items 9 and 10 will house the bearings and item 2 which is the rotor to be balanced will stick out of the casing. To regulate the rpm using the Logitech Electronics tachometer and magnetic pickup will replace items 23 and 24.  This tachometer equipment can measure up to 999,999rpm.An air compressor with regulator an additional compressed air heater is optional to replace 16, 21 and 22.I'm considering combining something modern like an accelerometer to measure vibration. This would replace items 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32.I have already made a basic replication of Tesla's ""vibration gauge"" but I think a digital version would be more accurate and not have to touch the shaft.Basic First Prototype of Tesla's Fig 3. Vibration GaugeBuilding Tesla's mechanical version is really simple and a comparison test could be carried out between the digital and analogue measuring tool. Nikola Tesla states:""When the structure is revolving at the proper speed I bring the abrasive wheel into operative contact with it at a peripheral or other suitable region and grind off material. As the action continues, the flexure of the shaft diminishes until, finally, its center of symmetry coincides with the center of gravity of the system, or nearly so. This can be noted in many cases by a competent operator without the use of a special device, but suitable visible or audible means may be employed for the purpose."" Strangely there are three item 32's in the patent diagram. The two on the right hand side are for the vibration gauge graduated scale and the one on the left in Fig 4. is for a suitable fixture to spray the abrasive jet 33. I think Fig 4. is for rotating parts with no shaft. Number 35. is a flexible shaft and this infers the rotor has no shaft after balancing is effected. Tesla's improved rotor design British Patent 186,082 features a hub.

Since then we shipped 50 AquaShield units worldwide and received a ton of feedback from our backers. Based on these, we improved almost every part of the AquaShield. AquaShield is a smart home system for your greenhouse or indoor farm:It tracks all important environmental parameters like PH, EC, temperature, humidity, light intestity, VPD, dew point and much more. With AquaShield, you can automate your hydroponic or aquaponic system: you can control grow lights, pumps, valves or any other active component. The device is capable to connect to the internet, so you can access your AquaShield anytime, anywhere. Produce high quality crops using automation. AquaShield helps you to save time, reduce cost and work more efficiently. AquaShield can control 8 devices (grow lights, pumps, fans etc.) simultaneously.AquaShield 2.0 can also host PWM (pulse width modulation) enabled dosing pumps, LED grow lights, servos and much more.For an easier use, we also developed our own dosing pumps, that can easily control your PH (use PH+ or PH-) or maintain the optimal EC by adding nutrients based on the AquaShield’s EC readings.The in-house developed software tracks all sensors real-time, stores all data and alerts you if needed. Monitoring features of the AquaShield Connect: sensors, graphs and calibration   Controlling features of the AquaShield Connect: activate relays and dosing pump setup  Automation with the AquaShield Connect: Time and sensor based workflows and alerting features   AquaShield 2.0 is commercial ready, but we need your help to ramp up production. AquaShield has 9 different PCB boards that only could be manufactured economically if we order in larger quantities. With larger order quantities we can also negotiate better prices for the housing and sensors, so we will have more money to spend on further development of the device and the software.   Please be aware that all shipping costs, VAT and sales taxes will be collected after the campaign is over. We’re a Budapest, Hungary based company, so we will ship all perks from Hungary. Taxes will vary depending on where we deliver the perks. We have to charge VAT, if your shipping address is in the European Union.In other cases - for example if you back us from the United States - we won’t charge any taxes, however sales taxes and custom fees may apply, might be levied on your parcel.

Emergency power backup is more important than ever now, but this does not mean that any power station will do the job. Cheap and faulty batteries can cause more problems than they solve. At SUNGZU’s we only make power stations with the latest battery technology, the highest safety protocols, and the best materials.   If we compare LiFePO4 batteries to traditional ternary lithium batteries, the latter are less stable due to their active chemical composition, which is more reactive to high temperatures and that can lead to explosions. LiFePO4 batteries have a more stable internal structure, are less likely to decompose at higher temperatures, are more resistant to overcharging,less likely to short circuit, and are less susceptible to spontaneous explosion. Our power stations are made to last. The SKA series is constructed with a high-strength aluminum alloy casing with integrated molding technology.  The front and back of the power stations are made of high-performance fireproof plastic. How many things can walk away unscratched after being run over by a 4x4 (4000lbs/ 2000kg)?  The LiFePO4 batteries can handle high temperatures with minimal degradation thanks to the sufficient space between each battery cell, better ventilation and heat dissipation is provided. This can greatly expand its life cycle and no maintenance is required. Our units can last up to 15 years in continuous use. Sungzu’s revolutionary BMS technology is capable of maintaining 90% of the battery's capacity for a year after a full charge. A standby power source ready to go.As seen on

 

Don’t let the outer casing made of aluminum case fool you. SUNGZU’s engineers thought of every aspect of the power station, including its portability. The SKA series are close to the size of a Macbook Pro and can be carried around easily. A reliable companion no matter where you go.Sudden power outage? To combat those unexpected dark moments, Sungzu has designed an innovative night light system. Simply touch the screen or press any button, and both the screen and sockets will light up!  The unique front and rear airflow design of the product, combined with the silent turbine fan and the intelligent temperature control system, can quickly reduce the internal temperature from overheating. The SKA series can operate in extreme high and low temperatures.1000W AC Output | Peak to 2000WCan effortlessly power your essential and everyday devices, from your almighty communication devices, kitchen appliances to working tools.1500W AC Output | Peak to 3000WTaking it up a notch with the SKA1500-T you can charge everything the SKA1000-T can but much longer. A reliable source of energy you can count on when disaster strikes by keeping vital home appliances and devices running without interruption.With the number of devices we have nowadays, we can’t help but juggle chargers and look for sockets. Say adios to those old days with our functional portable power stations to charge up all your devices- no more plugging and unplugging! The SKA series can charge 9 devices at once. You'll never forget to charge your laptop or phone again because every single one will be charged, all at the same time.3 AC Outlets  Due to the voltage difference in each country, we will match the voltage according to the country from your order’s address. The 50HZ and 60HZ AC output frequencies are switchable. Users don’t need to worry about the AC output frequency. Sungzu’s R&D team has implemented the most rigorous safety and quality controls by carrying out all relevant testing procedures to ensure that our units comply with the highest quality standards.A 2-year quality warranty is included from when you receive your product (accessories are excluded). Sungzu provides maintenance and replacement services free of charge. We have set up after-sales agents in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Britain, France, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and other countries so that the whole process is simple and hassle-free.For the first time, you'll never have to worry about running out of battery power. Sungzu is an all-in-one power station that has 3 convenient ways to recharge: wall outlet, car charging and solar panels. Whether you're at home or out in nature, our units are the perfect pick-me-up for your devices.

The LiFePO4 battery we use is the safest and most durable battery material, and we have done more than a dozen safety tests during production to ensure that our product does not catch fire, does not explode, and does not leak.
Our Cellpowa 500 retains 80% of its original capacity after 2000 full charge cycles, it means that you can use it every day for more than 4 years!  And while The average output drops，the life cycle will increase more.
 

 

 
Compared with similar products on the market, cellpowa 500 uses safer materials and has more battery capacity. Cellpowa 500 also has a much longer cycle life than other power stations that use lithium batteries.However, our price in indiegogo is more favorable than other products.

Through our actual measurement, due to the influence of light intensity, our Solarpowa 100 solar panel can actually reach 90-100W, which is higher than other similar products. 
More importantly, our crowdfunding price is only $159, which is cheaper than other similar products.
 

 
A variety of accessories to meet your needs.
 

 


BigBlue was founded in 2015. Since we were founded, we have been committed to developing energy storage products with better performance, newer design and higher safety factor. Up to now we have a team of more than 200 people, including more than 100 R & D personnel.
Bigblue mainly produces and operates energy storage equipment and solar energy equipment. It has been sold all over the world through the Amazon platform for many years. It is a stable and mature brand. We are committed to realizing an environmentally friendly economy through solar power panels and energy storage equipment.


After continuous research and exploration, we have created a series of practical consumer electronics products such as solar chargers, desktop docking stations, energy storage systems, car chargers, micro USB cables, etc., which have brought convenience to more than 1 million customers in over 170 countries worldwide. In December of last year, our R&D team began to study power stations and drew the first sketch of Cellpowa 500.
We are designing a 3000WH power station now, we plan to launch it in August! Before that we have set up a Facebook group for the customers who are interested in it. We will post the latest news about the power station there, everyone is welcome to discuss and make comments. We will improve the product based on your comments and suggestions, and then randomly select the lucky ones among the participants to give out gifts!
 
In the future, we look forward to combining portable power stations with solar panels to create mobile solar generator and home backup powerwall, making green and clean energy available everywhere. In this way, we hope to provide enough electricity to households in power-poor areas and promote development. Let's build your living space and power the world!
 

 
In addition, we are keen to contribute to social rescue operations, and hope our products can provide power support for people suffering from disaster!",59.0,1,"1 Campaign

</ul></div>","Legion Solar is a simple do-it-yourself solar system with battery storage and off grid power with artificial intelligence (AI).Prices will INCREASE after this campaign. This is your LAST CHANCE to get Legion Solar at these exclusive low prices. Solar energy is no longer an expensive complicated process. Install Legion Solar virtually anywhere. Legion Solar is designed for anybody with any skill level to setup. It's that simple!      Legion Solar works with your existing rate program to simply drive your consumption down. The result is simply a lowered electric bill.   We created SolarRegulator™, an artificial intelligence computer to contain generated energy behind your meter where the utility company does not control. Energy production of each Micro-Inverter is controlled so that energy production is less than or equal to energy consumption allowing you to generate your own electricity unrestricted. Utility company only sees less consumption from you, not a grid tied solar system. As a result, it is not necessary to seek interconnection permission pertaining to utility company approved grid-tied solar systems. We took all the short comings of traditional solar systems and designed a game changing new solution to outperform. As you become familiar with Legion Solar, size up your system in stages. The larger the system, the more you'll offset and the more you'll save.
Stage 1 - Get familiar with Legion Solar and it's components with the Starter Set. Sets up in minutes and experience instant results.
Stage 2 - Scale your solar output with expansion sets to offset your daytime usage.
Stage 3 - Once your system is large enough to have excess energy to store during daylight, add expansion sets with BatteryCommander™ for night time consumption.
Stage 4 - Add Off Grid Controller™ and an Off Grid Inverter so that you have emergency power during grid power outages.
  Bluetooth interface allows you to monitor your energy production and consumption, check system health, diagnostics and more via the LegionSolar App for Apple/Android. Try it for fee today. Search ""Legion Solar"" in iTunes or Google Play.  Traditional solar systems have built-in costs such as resellers markups, installation labor, permits, sales reps, and other fees. Legion Solar is energy delivered straight to your door without the unnecessary costs giving you up to 3x faster ROI.  Legion Solar makes financial sense and outperforms nearly all other investments.  Legion Solar also outperforms nearly all other forms of energy in long term energy value. It makes clean energy PROFITABLE for you with ZERO emissions.Basic Expansion SetDeluxe Expansion SetDeluxe Expansion Set + Lithium BatteryAdditional Accessories To include Add-On items, tap ""GET THIS PERK"" button that appears with your desired contribution. Add On perks are available for you to select from the ""Perks you may also like"" section.Backers and customers who currently own sets with Battery Commander 1, a FREE upgrade option is available to Battery Commander 2 with your pledge of the Deluxe Expansion Set or Deluxe Expansion Set with Lithium Battery up to the number of Battery Commander 1's that you currently own. For example, if you currently own 4 sets with Battery Commander 1 and you pledge for 5 Deluxe Expansion Sets, 4 Battery Commander 2 units will be included for FREE to upgrade your existing Battery Commander 1 to Battery Commander 2. Legion Solar photovoltaic panels are 50% lighter and designed specifically for the Legion Solar Micro-Inverter to achieve an ideal system match for high efficiency DC to AC conversion. Rated for hurricane force winds, hail, and snow. High efficiency A Grade polycrystalline cells delivers unsurpassed price/watt performance with a 30 year service life. Legion Solar micro-inverters are designed to achieve ideal system match for high efficiency DC to AC conversion. Up to 32 micro-inverters can be connected in a daisy-chain. Our micro-inverters employ maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technology to achieve maximum power output in full sun and partial shade conditions. LegionConnex™ wiring simplifies connectivity ideally suited for the do-it-yourself installer.  Micro-inverters outperform that of traditional central inverters due to no single point of failure. Each inverter cell works independently of each other to maximize energy production in partial cloud or shady conditions. Legion Solar Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) 25.6V 100Ah 2560Wh Deep Cycle batteries were carefully selected to be the ideal match for Battery Commander 2 in voltage, capacity, energy power density and weight optimized for do-it-yourself energy storage solutions.   Lithium batteries are far superior to that of Lead Acid batteries in nearly every way. BatteryCommander 2 (New) connects in between the micro inverter and the solar panel. During daylight solar energy is used to supplement usage from your utility company and charge the batteries. At night, batteries supplement your usage enabling Legion Solar to completely offset all of your daytime and nighttime consumption. Compatible with Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) and standard Sealed Lead Acid Batteries , two deep cycle 12V batteries or connected in series or one 24V battery with capacity range 60-120Ah is recommended for each BatteryCommander branch.  OffGrid Controller is a combiner hub for your batteries to multiply usable capacity. It detects when grid power goes down and automatically turns on power to the backup inverter to supply power to an off grid branch circuit where you can power all of your basic necessities in any emergency. When power goes out, lights and appliances connected to this branch automatically turn on. When power comes back, the emergency branch circuit automatically turns off. Compatible with both Lithium and Lead Acid battery chemistries.  Off Grid Inverter is used to supply grid compatible AC power from 24V batteries for use with appliances rated up to 3000 Watts. Have peace of mind for you and your family in any emergency. Tap to see manuals and more how to videos and demonstrations.Legion Solar 6 introduces the new SMR Roof Racking system with the following improvements:

We have some more exciting news. BuffaloGrid have confirmed a collaboration with UK for UNHCR, the national charity partner for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and I can now confirm the first batch of Buffalitos you have helped fund will be delivered directly to the Bidibidi Refugee Settlement in Uganda. UNHCR will ensure that they are provided for free to the people that need them most. There are 1.2 million refugees in Uganda's Bidi Bidi Settlement which is the largest refugee camp in Uganda and the second largest in the world, covering 250 square kilometres.
It is estimated that 73 % of men and 44 % of women in Bidi Bidi own a phone. We are honoured to put power and light into their hands by providing Buffalitos to refugees across the camp.
 
The Buffalito by BuffaloGrid is a multi-purpose lighting and mobile charging device.  Each Buffalito sold supports BuffaloGrid's ""Get Power, Give Power"" campaign to raise awareness of the global power problem and to play our part in solving it.  Each Buffalito sold will help support our work providing power to the 1 Billion people worldwide who lack reliable access to grid power. This helps to transform lives as people are now able to charge their cell phones so they can stay connected, and light their homes, enabling them to work and read late into the night.  Charge the Buffalito and in just 50 minutes and it provides enough power to completely refill a smartphone battery, while still working as a light for hours.  BuffaloGrid’s mission is to remove internet adoption barriers by providing free power to charge mobile devices and digital services to connect the Next Billion.  The Buffalito is designed to act as a portable and cost-effective way for millions of people to transport and store electricity. It was created to compliment our solar-powered BuffaloGrid Hub. The Hub is a solar-powered charging station designed to sit in the centre of a village in a shop or public building where people can charge multiple phones and power banks at once.    TechCrunch: ""...while smartphones put the internet in everybody’s pocket, without a way to keep our phones powered, connectivity and its utility is limited."" The Guardian: ""Since 2010, BuffaloGrid has been working to bring cheap electricity to rural communities in Uganda, where 80% of the population owns mobile phones but only 5% has access to power.""   The Buffalito packs a LOT of features into its small size. Whether living in a busy, modern city, or in a rural village, the Buffalito has a use for you!  Power bank with a rugged design and 5v of output so you can charge even the most power-intensive phones.  At 160 lumens, your Buffalito will work great as a bike light. And lasts for 4 hours  even after charging your phone!  Integrated light with 3 different brightness settings.  A range of accessories allow the Buffalito to be used for multiple purposes, including:- Bike light- Reading lamp - Portable power bank  At 20 lumens, the Buffalito lasts even longer and makes the ideal reading light with 36 hours of power.  Even the packaging serves a dual purpose. We’ve joined forces with Japan’s N&R Foldings to make sure the Buffalito box won’t end up in a landfill because it folds into a simple but beautiful lamp. Features Overview:•Front LED array •Universal mounting system for attaching a range of custom accessories. •1x USB-C port for charging •1x front button for on/off function and switching between modes. •2900mah battery   This lack of power has consequences. It creates disconnected communities, unable to keep in touch with friends and family, or access information online.  Globally, there's a growing digital, social & economic divide, which is aggravated by limited connectivity and infrastructure. Almost half the population of the planet have never experienced the internet and one of the main barriers for internet adoption is reliable access to power. There are billions of overlooked consumers, who with access to mobile digital services could improve their quality of life and business activities.   For each Buffalito sold, you're helping provide education, empowerment, economic development and growth that changes lives.   Wherever you are in the world, anyone can benefit from the Buffalito. For those living in rural India you can refill the power from any of our BuffaloGrid hubs. Never worry about running out of power. Charge your phone on the go and use your light to read, work or commute.  BuffaloGrid is a company on a mission to bring power and connect the next billion. We’ve spent the last 8 years working across India and Sub Saharan Africa to remove the barriers that millions of people face in getting online.   Last year BuffaloGrid partnered with Airtel one of India’s biggest mobile network operators to bring solar energy and internet to thousands of people in off-grid communities across Uttar Pradesh.  We are backed by Microsoft and by some of the most reputable Venture Capital funds in Europe. We were incubated at the Royal College of Art Incubator (Innovation RCA).  Our products enable frontier-market smartphone owners to use their devices more often and to use them for more. We’re committed to promoting sustainable development through connectivity.   BuffaloGrid was founded by Daniel Becerra, a design entrepreneur, and Phil Schluter, a coffee trader. Phil's company had been buying coffee from rural communities in nations across Africa for more than 155 years. He witnessed how coffee farmers had to travel for up to 2.5 hours to charge their phones for vital information to trade, sometimes already having travelled for days to get to market.Having identified a real need, and utilizing Daniel's experience in award-winning energy design, Phil and Daniel set out to create a highly scalable product and service that will impact the lives of millions.This is how the Mighty-H was born. A solar-powered charging Hub, capable of charging ten phones per hour. Also, the Mighty-H comes pre-loaded with 1TB of content which allows consistent streaming and digital content access in areas with limited mobile network reception and no fiber optics or wired internet.   The Buffalito is the natural extension of this mission, and provides a portable way to add additional hours of power and light to the over one billion people living without access to grid power.   Our services offer to our frontier users the following:
 Free Power - 5V outputs where users can charge phones and other devices. 
 Hubs provide a feedback loop that allows for anonymized data analytics and market insights.
 Mobile network-enabled hardware that provides consistent streaming of digital content in areas with limited mobile network reception or no wired internet. 
 Hubs are pre-loaded with pre-selected content that updates regularly over mobile networks.

We are a team of engineers from Romania, and we started focusing our efforts on projects that are related to energy storage and recycling for almost two years now.</p><p>Earlier this year, we did a funding project on Indiegogo for our first product, that’s called <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/megacellcharger-mass-production/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Megacell Charger.</a> With the help of the DIY community, it was a success. Thank you for all the support and patience to all the contributors!</p><p>There have been some challenges to pull this off, but we managed to handle them in the end. The first batch has been shipped already to the backers.</p><p> </p><h2>SBMS40 - How the idea started</h2><p>While working on the Megacell Charger project, I’ve connected with some people with similar interests. One of them is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/jehugarcia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jehu Garcia.</a> In one of the discussions, I’ve learned the fact that he liked a certain BMS a lot, but it was hard to order due to the slow manufacturing process.</p><p>I’ve checked out the datasheet of the BMS, some videos, and indeed, it looked like an exciting project.</p><p>The name of the project is <a href=""http://electrodacus.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electrodacus SBMS.</a> I’ve written Dacian an email to see if we can help him in any way to produce more of these to cover the high demand.</p><p>He explained to me that the process of building his device the way is designed is not something that’s easy to reproduce in the factory and that it will have to be redesigned for mass manufacturing. He mentioned that it would take too much of his time to do it, and he was not interested.</p><p>I’ve talked with my colleague Mihai that also designed the Megacell Charger circuit, if we could take care of this part, obtaining a working prototype of the new design and make sure that everything works fine.</p><p>He was confident that’s doable and got to work.</p><p>I’ve asked Dacian if we have his permission to reproduce his device and use the software in exchange for a fee that we pay him per item sold. He pointed to me that the project is open source, and everyone could do it. Still, I considered that would’ve not been fair, the software took hundreds or even thousands of hours to create and polish to make sure it works 100% of the time, and there is significant work on designing the hardware as well.</p><p>He wasn’t very sure that we can even do it, saying that two other companies tried in the past with no success, not having the right engineers to redesign the board and to test it properly. Still, he accepted my proposal, and we had his blessing to continue redesigning his product.</p><p>Within a few weeks, the new design was ready, we got the prototype board, and soldered all the parts by hand as usual. There were some issues to fix. Once that was done, we ordered the first small batch of 20 SBMS’ses at the factory to establish the workflow and fine-tune the pricing.</p><p><a href=""http://electrodacus.com/SBMS120/manual/SBMSmanual.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602843243/hhx8o8ttwf6tdea9aha5.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://electrodacus.com/SBMS120/manual/SBMSmanual.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click on the image to download the Datasheet</a></p><h3>Features &amp; Benefits - SBMS40</h3><p>What’s nice about the SBMS40 is that you can connect it directly to solar panels, battery, and to a load that’s up to 40 Amps at 24 Volts.</p><p>You also have the option of connecting relays or big contactors for both the load and the charging ports. Here’s the setup we did using 90 Amps DC Solid State Relays.</p><p>- Supports 3 to 8 cells -<strong> LiFePo4, LiCoO2, Li4Ti5O12, Capacitors 2.3V, 2,5V,  2.7V </strong><br/>- Battery voltage limits 8V to 32V<br/>- Max PV Open Circuit voltage - 47V<br/>- Max PV Current 40A<br/>- Load + overcurrent limit 40A<br/>- Cell balancing current max 200mA<br/>- Onboard (PCB mounted) temperature sensor <br/>- Battery temperature probe (10k termistor) - Optional<br/>- 16 pin connector : Includes Ext IO, 16bit ADC<br/>- 8 pin connector : external shunt bidirectional + 2 x 700 mA SSR<br/>- Data logging to internal Flash Memory - 128Mbit, 2 minute interval for one year of data<br/>- WiFi - used for remote monitoring as Access Point<br/>- Display - 2.2"" Color LCD 320x 240<br/>- Weight - 200g<br/>- Dimensions - 127mm x 80mm x 18mm</p><p> </p><h3>Features &amp; Benefits  - SBMS0</h3><p>For those that are not interested in the onboard charging and discharging MOSFETs, we also made available a version that’s the equivalent of SBMS0. This option comes in at a lower price, and you will need to use Relays such as SSR or contactors to control your charging and the load.</p><p>SBMS0 is the low cost version of this hardware, that does not include the power electronics (built in current shunt, ideal diode, power mosfets and WiFi module).</p><p>It has all other functions like full BMS functionality:</p><p>- Supports 3 to 8 cells -<strong> LiFePo4, LiCoO2, Li4Ti5O12, Capacitors 2.3V, 2,5V,  2.7V </strong><br/>- Battery voltage limits 8V to 32V<br/>- Cell balancing current max 200mA<br/>- Onboard (PCB mounted) temperature sensor <br/>- Battery temperature probe (10k termistor) - Optional<br/>- 16 pin connector : Includes Ext IO, 16bit ADC<br/>- 10 pin connector : external shunt bidirectional + 2 x 700 mA SSR + PV shunt<br/>- Data logging to internal Flash Memory - 128Mbit, 2 minute interval for one year of data<br/>- Display - 2.2"" Color LCD 320x 240<br/>- Weight - 200g<br/>- Dimensions - 127mm x 80mm x 18mm<br/>- Supports external shunt up to 500A same as SBMS40<br/>- Has EXT IO3 and EXT IO4 for remote On/Off an inverter or a charger</p><p>SBMS0 can be used with Victron Multiplus inverter/charger.</p><p>It can be also used with external DC SSR (solid state relay) to add PV panel charging capability to the SBMS0, getting same functionality as the SBMS40, this makes it very flexible and cost effective.</p><p>Data can be also accessed over serial port (UART) if you want to interface with Raspberry Pi or other computing devices</p><p> </p><h2>Headless SBMS</h2><p>Both SBMS0 and SBMS40 are fantastic for big setups, and the price makes sense. But for smaller arrangements or Lead replacement packs, the cost can be a problem.

I am the funder of 3D-Brothers and Deep Cycle Power. We are a team of engineers from Romania, and we started focusing our efforts on projects that are related to energy storage and recycling for almost two years now.Earlier this year, we did a funding project on Indiegogo for our first product, that’s called The Megacell Charger. With the help of the DIY community, it was a success. Thank you for all the support and patience to all the contributors!There have been some challenges to pull this off, but we managed to handle them in the end. The first batch has been shipped already to the backers. SBMS40 - How the idea startedWhile working on the Megacell Charger project, I’ve connected with some people with similar interests. One of them is Jehu Garcia. In one of the discussions, I’ve learned the fact that he liked a certain BMS a lot, but it was hard to order due to the slow manufacturing process.I’ve checked out the datasheet of the BMS, some videos, and indeed, it looked like an exciting project.The name of the project is Electrodacus SBMS. I’ve written Dacian an email to see if we can help him in any way to produce more of these to cover the high demand.He explained to me that the process of building his device the way is designed is not something that’s easy to reproduce in the factory and that it will have to be redesigned for mass manufacturing. He mentioned that it would take too much of his time to do it, and he was not interested.I’ve talked with my colleague Mihai that also designed the Megacell Charger circuit, if we could take care of this part, obtaining a working prototype of the new design and make sure that everything works fine.He was confident that’s doable and got to work.I’ve asked Dacian if we have his permission to reproduce his device and use the software in exchange for a fee that we pay him per item sold. He pointed to me that the project is open source, and everyone could do it. Still, I considered that would’ve not been fair, the software took hundreds or even thousands of hours to create and polish to make sure it works 100% of the time, and there is significant work on designing the hardware as well.He wasn’t very sure that we can even do it, saying that two other companies tried in the past with no success, not having the right engineers to redesign the board and to test it properly. Still, he accepted my proposal, and we had his blessing to continue redesigning his product.Within a few weeks, the new design was ready, we got the prototype board, and soldered all the parts by hand as usual. There were some issues to fix. Once that was done, we ordered the first small batch of 20 SBMS’ses at the factory to establish the workflow and fine-tune the pricing.Click on the image to download the DatasheetFeatures & Benefits - SBMS40What’s nice about the SBMS40 is that you can connect it directly to solar panels, battery, and to a load that’s up to 40 Amps at 24 Volts.You also have the option of connecting relays or big contactors for both the load and the charging ports. Here’s the setup we did using 90 Amps DC Solid State Relays.- Supports 3 to 8 cells - LiFePo4, LiCoO2, Li4Ti5O12, Capacitors 2.3V, 2,5V,  2.7V - Battery voltage limits 8V to 32V- Max PV Open Circuit voltage - 47V- Max PV Current 40A- Load + overcurrent limit 40A- Cell balancing current max 200mA- Onboard (PCB mounted) temperature sensor - Battery temperature probe (10k termistor) - Optional- 16 pin connector : Includes Ext IO, 16bit ADC- 8 pin connector : external shunt bidirectional + 2 x 700 mA SSR- Data logging to internal Flash Memory - 128Mbit, 2 minute interval for one year of data- WiFi - used for remote monitoring as Access Point- Display - 2.2"" Color LCD 320x 240- Weight - 200g- Dimensions - 127mm x 80mm x 18mm Features & Benefits  - SBMS0For those that are not interested in the onboard charging and discharging MOSFETs, we also made available a version that’s the equivalent of SBMS0. This option comes in at a lower price, and you will need to use Relays such as SSR or contactors to control your charging and the load.SBMS0 is the low cost version of this hardware, that does not include the power electronics (built in current shunt, ideal diode, power mosfets and WiFi module).It has all other functions like full BMS functionality:- Supports 3 to 8 cells - LiFePo4, LiCoO2, Li4Ti5O12, Capacitors 2.3V, 2,5V,  2.7V - Battery voltage limits 8V to 32V- Cell balancing current max 200mA- Onboard (PCB mounted) temperature sensor - Battery temperature probe (10k termistor) - Optional- 16 pin connector : Includes Ext IO, 16bit ADC- 10 pin connector : external shunt bidirectional + 2 x 700 mA SSR + PV shunt- Data logging to internal Flash Memory - 128Mbit, 2 minute interval for one year of data- Display - 2.2"" Color LCD 320x 240- Weight - 200g- Dimensions - 127mm x 80mm x 18mm- Supports external shunt up to 500A same as SBMS40- Has EXT IO3 and EXT IO4 for remote On/Off an inverter or a chargerSBMS0 can be used with Victron Multiplus inverter/charger.It can be also used with external DC SSR (solid state relay) to add PV panel charging capability to the SBMS0, getting same functionality as the SBMS40, this makes it very flexible and cost effective.Data can be also accessed over serial port (UART) if you want to interface with Raspberry Pi or other computing devices Headless SBMSBoth SBMS0 and SBMS40 are fantastic for big setups, and the price makes sense. But for smaller arrangements or Lead replacement packs, the cost can be a problem. For this reason, we got one step further and designed the Headless SBMS.  In this version, we separated the display and the programming part from the actual BMS which handles the cells. This way, you can have multiple BMS’es that you program before installing, then they work as standalone units.We have this prototype board that we can show right now. The PCB’s are in the making, but we tested, and everything works great.Features of the Headless SBMSThe headless version will have similar features with the SBMS0, only that the programing part and monitoring can be detached.- Supports 3 to 8 cells - LiFePo4, LiCoO2, Li4Ti5O12, Capacitors 2.3V, 2,5V,  2.7V - Battery voltage limits 8V to 32V- Cell balancing current max 200mA- Battery temperature probe (10k termistor) - Optional- 4 pin connector : 2 x 700 mA SSR- Display - 2.2"" Color LCD 320x 240 (Only for programming)- Weight - 50gThe Headless SBMS that has been designed to run without a display and other IC’s used while programming and monitoring.

We thought about an affordable solution and came up with a Bluetooth and Ant+ module that displays the voltage for eight cells. The beautiful part is that these modules can connect and form a pack in the phone app. The application is at a prototype stage right now and offers only basic functionality, but it works.If there will be more than 200 items sold for this device, we plan on extending the app and offer more functionalities, like automation, alarms, and central monitoring software for raspberry pi or similar device.I think the functionalities are endless for this small Bluetooth device. Here are some examples of how we used it to monitor different types of packs.The price of this module is $18, and you can get a great deal if you buy 10 for $150. You will find the link on the right side of the page for the single unit, the pack of 10, or the mega bundle that will include all the devices. Laptop Battery ReaderAnother project that we thought it’s helpful when it comes to recovering cells from laptop batteries is a small device that can connect to batteries and display the info from the BMS.You can see information such as:
Cycle count
Manufacturer
Manufacturing date
Voltage per cell
There is other info that we display, but these are the most important ones. You spend a few seconds scanning the pack, and then you can decide if it’s worth opening or if it’s dead.Some other packs can be recovered if they are low on cycle count, and it needs just charging.People from the DIY community have requested such a device. I’ve received posts and messages pointing to a tool called PRO Laptop Battery Analyzer. It’s a great device, especially if you want to recover the laptop batteries.

<h2>A Better Way Forward</h2>
<p>It's time to put an end to single-use plastics in all their forms. Straws, spoons, forks, knives, whatever. Enough is enough. Society and governments alike are coming to the realization that the vast majority of plastics used on a daily basis are made in such a way that they practically last forever in landfills or--worse yet--in our oceans. We're talking about billions of single-use plastics tossed in the trash on a yearly basis! We have to do better. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611012022/zpicluzedvt3gcfb8mzp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Thankfully, many countries are introducing reforms to curb the production and use of single-use plastics. People are looking for greener alternatives like paper straws, biodegradable plastics, and reusables.  We went to the drawing board to come up with a set of elegant reusables that had to: 1) work really well 2) look really nice and 3) be really compact. The STRO and SPORQ are the result of over a year's worth of tinkering and R&amp;D to that end. </p>
<p>Our company is Juka Innovations and from day one, we've set out to help solve some of the world's most annoying problems with innovative products. You may have tried our award-winning <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BYMTYBS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TubShroom</a>, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W8218FZ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SinkShroom</a>, and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LNZGQF7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ShowerShroom</a> drain protection products, which can be found in over 6 million homes around the globe. That's potentially millions of gallons of harmful liquid chemicals that people will no longer use to clear their clogged drains. We'd love to help in the fight against single-use plastics with our latest products: the STRO and SPORQ.   </p>

<p>At long last, the straw revolution is upon us. It's no exaggeration to say that billions of plastic straws fill the world's landfills and oceans on an almost yearly basis! The average consumer can use thousands of plastic straws each year. World governments are finally realizing the long-term impact all this waste is having on our environment and on our sea life. Some countries have already banned plastic bags and plastic straws. Even more forward-looking legislation is on the way, thankfully. </p>

<p>One simple change in daily habits--like using a reusable straw in place of plastic straws--can have a profound impact on our collective global outlook. Our goal with the STRO™ Straw was to create an effective, durable, and easy-to-use stainless steel straw that could discretely attach to your keychain, belt, or bag and be there whenever you drink your favorite soft drink or frozen coffee beverage. We've tried it with cola cans, Starbucks drinks, fast-food cups--you name it. The premium stainless steel tips give you a cool, smooth sip every time. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611012687/offtwirpyacbxhxgwu5o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The 7.8"" tall STRO straw works fabulously well with virtually every can, bottle, or cup we threw at it. It's tall enough to mimic and replace most of the popular plastic straws you find in restaurants today. Next time the cashier or wait staff asks you if you want a straw, you can politely decline because you'll have the smoothest sipping reusable straw already at your side. Paper straws start to wilt within minutes of use. Silicone or rubber straws are flimsy and aren't the most premium way to sip, to be honest. And no one wants to carry around those rigid full-sized stainless steel straws. We're all used to the single-use plastic straws from years of habit, but it's time to collectively move on from those.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611012716/yfd1spxc8l6nczuz1cau.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Let's talk about cleaning. No one wants to carry around brushes with them everywhere they go so we built in squeegee style brushes where the straws go so you can more effectively rinse each straw part along with the holder itself under running water whenever you get to a sink. It's a game-changer. We have also gone the extra step of including a mini nylon brush that you can keep at home for a more comprehensive deep cleaning  of all the parts.  The STRO and SPORQ are both made from high-quality, BPA-free materials.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.ibb.co/4Mg0rCJ/stro2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The STRO straw is ultra compact (about 3""x1.5""x.6"" in holder) and looks discrete enough to blend in on any keychain, bag, or belt buckle. It even slides right into your front pocket with ease. You may even forget it's there... until you're ready for a drink, that is! We know there are other reusable straw alternatives out there and we absolutely love that this market is growing because, frankly, it's long overdue. We've found that many other reusable straws are either too bulky to carry around, too flimsy to sip straight, or too aesthetically unappealing. Paper straws are also growing in popularity, which is great, though they turn to mush unless you finish your drink within a few minutes of use. With the STRO straw, we set out to deliver an answer to all these problems.  </p>

<p>Next up, we turned our sights on to single-use throwaway plastic utensils. You know the ones you find at virtually every fast food restaurant or deli. Plastic spoons, forks, knives--you name it. The plastics are built to be sturdy so they don't break while you're eating but the problem with that is that they take forever (almost literally!) to decompose so it's easy to see why plastic utensils are some of the most destructive products in the history of mankind. We have to curb the use and production of single-use plastics before it's too late.  The SPORQ is a compact, convenient solution to this problem.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.ibb.co/7rCxcZc/sporq1.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611013168/vff89dktckuztcmgk3wv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Just like with the STRO, we wanted the SPORQ to be super durable, compact, and easy to use. What's the use of all that portability if you're not happy with the way it works in daily use? It's got to feel and work better than the plastic alternatives. So we went with high-quality stainless steel. One side is a spoon head and the other is a fork with a serrated edge that doubles as a knife. We even had the room to toss on a bottle opener. You're going to love eating your meals with your SPORQ. The spoon head is smaller than a tablespoon, so it will help you with portion control while you pace yourself. The SPORQ fits comfortably in your handle, from either end. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611013204/oppa7kf9n2zirovwur6r.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

World governments are finally realizing the long-term impact all this waste is having on our environment and on our sea life. One simple change in daily habits--like using reusable utensils in place of plastics--can have a profound impact. Our goal with the SPORQ is to create an effective, durable, and easy-to-use stainless steel utensil that could discretely attach to your keychain, belt, or bag. All SPORQ's will include a stainless steel clip for maximum portability and tiny magnets help the unit elegantly snap and hold together. </p>

<p>We estimate that if you replace your average daily use of plastic utensils and straws with both the SPORQ and STRO, you could potentially save over 25 times(!) the equivalent weight of single-use plastic material over the course of a typical year. Now imagine if millions of people made the switch to reusables like ours. It truly adds up in profound ways. The future can be brighter for us and for our children with a few simple habitual changes. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.ibb.co/k13dKwq/sporq2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You can enjoy a premium eating experience on the go with the SPORQ 4-in-1 reusable spoon, fork, knife, and bottle opener set to help save the planet one meal at a time. It's lightweight and durable, and it's great for virtually all meal types. Soups, salads, cereal, fruits, veggies, yogurt, eggs--you name it. The SPORQ is perfect for camping, on-the-go, at the office, or at any fast food establishment. You owe it to yourself to dine out in style with the SPORQ.  We expect to ship both the SPORQ and the STRO in April 2021 which is just a few short months away.   </p>

<p>In late 2015, Juka Innovations Corporation was started in Glen Cove, NY by Serge Karnegie and Solyman Najimi--two long-time friends.

<p><strong>Dear backers,</strong></p>
<p>Some of you have been with us since our very first project launched in 2015, and some of you will join the ""Shroom"" family for the first time. Regardless, we are very thankful for your support and trust in the quality of our products. Thanks to our early adapters, our original <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BYMTYBS/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me="" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TubShroom</a> was born, eventually becoming the #1 best-seller on Amazon and at many major big box retail stores. We're proud to say that since the launch in 2015, we have helped to protect close to 6 million drains worldwide.</p>
<p>We must say that there were a few bumps on the road. Inventory shortages, shipping delays, intellectual property battles, and more. We have had to learn the ins and outs of plumbing, drainage, and product design. Our team's focus is on producing innovative products that save people money, solve real-world problems, and that look great.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking this journey with us. We promise to do our utmost to continue to provide amazing products and terrific support. Please reach out to us at support@tubshroom.com with any questions you have on our previous products or for any topic you have not seen covered in this campaign.</p>

</div></div>","A Better Way Forward
It's time to put an end to single-use plastics in all their forms. Straws, spoons, forks, knives, whatever. Enough is enough. Society and governments alike are coming to the realization that the vast majority of plastics used on a daily basis are made in such a way that they practically last forever in landfills or--worse yet--in our oceans. We're talking about billions of single-use plastics tossed in the trash on a yearly basis! We have to do better. 

Thankfully, many countries are introducing reforms to curb the production and use of single-use plastics. People are looking for greener alternatives like paper straws, biodegradable plastics, and reusables.  We went to the drawing board to come up with a set of elegant reusables that had to: 1) work really well 2) look really nice and 3) be really compact. The STRO and SPORQ are the result of over a year's worth of tinkering and R&D to that end. 
Our company is Juka Innovations and from day one, we've set out to help solve some of the world's most annoying problems with innovative products. You may have tried our award-winning TubShroom, SinkShroom, and ShowerShroom drain protection products, which can be found in over 6 million homes around the globe. That's potentially millions of gallons of harmful liquid chemicals that people will no longer use to clear their clogged drains. We'd love to help in the fight against single-use plastics with our latest products: the STRO and SPORQ.   


At long last, the straw revolution is upon us. It's no exaggeration to say that billions of plastic straws fill the world's landfills and oceans on an almost yearly basis! The average consumer can use thousands of plastic straws each year. World governments are finally realizing the long-term impact all this waste is having on our environment and on our sea life. Some countries have already banned plastic bags and plastic straws. Even more forward-looking legislation is on the way, thankfully. 


One simple change in daily habits--like using a reusable straw in place of plastic straws--can have a profound impact on our collective global outlook. Our goal with the STRO™ Straw was to create an effective, durable, and easy-to-use stainless steel straw that could discretely attach to your keychain, belt, or bag and be there whenever you drink your favorite soft drink or frozen coffee beverage. We've tried it with cola cans, Starbucks drinks, fast-food cups--you name it. The premium stainless steel tips give you a cool, smooth sip every time. 

The 7.8"" tall STRO straw works fabulously well with virtually every can, bottle, or cup we threw at it. It's tall enough to mimic and replace most of the popular plastic straws you find in restaurants today. Next time the cashier or wait staff asks you if you want a straw, you can politely decline because you'll have the smoothest sipping reusable straw already at your side. Paper straws start to wilt within minutes of use. Silicone or rubber straws are flimsy and aren't the most premium way to sip, to be honest. And no one wants to carry around those rigid full-sized stainless steel straws. We're all used to the single-use plastic straws from years of habit, but it's time to collectively move on from those.   

Let's talk about cleaning. No one wants to carry around brushes with them everywhere they go so we built in squeegee style brushes where the straws go so you can more effectively rinse each straw part along with the holder itself under running water whenever you get to a sink. It's a game-changer. We have also gone the extra step of including a mini nylon brush that you can keep at home for a more comprehensive deep cleaning  of all the parts.  The STRO and SPORQ are both made from high-quality, BPA-free materials.  

The STRO straw is ultra compact (about 3""x1.5""x.6"" in holder) and looks discrete enough to blend in on any keychain, bag, or belt buckle. It even slides right into your front pocket with ease. You may even forget it's there... until you're ready for a drink, that is! We know there are other reusable straw alternatives out there and we absolutely love that this market is growing because, frankly, it's long overdue. We've found that many other reusable straws are either too bulky to carry around, too flimsy to sip straight, or too aesthetically unappealing. Paper straws are also growing in popularity, which is great, though they turn to mush unless you finish your drink within a few minutes of use. With the STRO straw, we set out to deliver an answer to all these problems.  



Next up, we turned our sights on to single-use throwaway plastic utensils. You know the ones you find at virtually every fast food restaurant or deli. Plastic spoons, forks, knives--you name it. The plastics are built to be sturdy so they don't break while you're eating but the problem with that is that they take forever (almost literally!) to decompose so it's easy to see why plastic utensils are some of the most destructive products in the history of mankind. We have to curb the use and production of single-use plastics before it's too late.  The SPORQ is a compact, convenient solution to this problem.


Just like with the STRO, we wanted the SPORQ to be super durable, compact, and easy to use. What's the use of all that portability if you're not happy with the way it works in daily use? It's got to feel and work better than the plastic alternatives. So we went with high-quality stainless steel. One side is a spoon head and the other is a fork with a serrated edge that doubles as a knife. We even had the room to toss on a bottle opener. You're going to love eating your meals with your SPORQ. The spoon head is smaller than a tablespoon, so it will help you with portion control while you pace yourself. The SPORQ fits comfortably in your handle, from either end. 

It's no exaggeration to say that billions of plastic utensils fill the world's landfills and oceans on an almost yearly basis! World governments are finally realizing the long-term impact all this waste is having on our environment and on our sea life. One simple change in daily habits--like using reusable utensils in place of plastics--can have a profound impact. Our goal with the SPORQ is to create an effective, durable, and easy-to-use stainless steel utensil that could discretely attach to your keychain, belt, or bag. All SPORQ's will include a stainless steel clip for maximum portability and tiny magnets help the unit elegantly snap and hold together. 

We estimate that if you replace your average daily use of plastic utensils and straws with both the SPORQ and STRO, you could potentially save over 25 times(!) the equivalent weight of single-use plastic material over the course of a typical year. Now imagine if millions of people made the switch to reusables like ours. It truly adds up in profound ways. The future can be brighter for us and for our children with a few simple habitual changes. 

You can enjoy a premium eating experience on the go with the SPORQ 4-in-1 reusable spoon, fork, knife, and bottle opener set to help save the planet one meal at a time. It's lightweight and durable, and it's great for virtually all meal types. Soups, salads, cereal, fruits, veggies, yogurt, eggs--you name it. The SPORQ is perfect for camping, on-the-go, at the office, or at any fast food establishment. You owe it to yourself to dine out in style with the SPORQ.  We expect to ship both the SPORQ and the STRO in April 2021 which is just a few short months away.

<p><strong>HOW CAN THESE TINY LIGHTS BE STRONG?</strong></p>
<p>Beneath generator technology one important aspect is the optimal choice of LED + lens which gives a big advantage compared to normal LED bicycle lights. For the Magnic Microlights we have chosen the newest extreme density - Cree LED (available since summer 2018): The most efficient high power LED with minimum size (1.6 mm x 1.6mm compared to 3.45mm x 3.45mm as used in many LED biycle lights). </p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for Magnic Microlights? </strong><br/><br/>Imagine you have a good bicycle light with 3,45mm x 3,45 mm LED, Lens of size 34,5 mm and 100 Lumen/Watt (These are quite excellent values for biycle lights). </p>

<p><br/>Our prototypes are less efficient than the final version because of lower generator power. We have to estimate the power of the final product based on the prototypes and our experience from the current Magnic Light version.</p>

<p><br/><i><b>BRAKE LIGHT</b></i></p>
<p>Magnic Microlights have an effective brake light function. When you pull the brakes the distance between rim and generator decreases resulting in higher generator power and higher light output. The brake light works precisely and is a clear signal for subsequent traffic.</p>
<div data-id=""23112766""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""WEGA might be the most universal bike light on planet earth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549879959/cgyj81zmr663debnq1eg.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p>All Magnic Microlights have an integrated ""Brake Light""-function shown here: When you pull the brakes the lights brighten up which warns the driver behind you.</p>

<p>The design of front-&amp; rearlight allows to adjust the light beam regardless of the fork angle. Even for extreme bicycle frame geometry you can adjust the light beam towards the road.</p>

<h1>4. HOW CAN YOUR BIKE GLOW AT NIGHT?</h1>
<p>When we tried to assemble the ""perfect"" bicycle for this technology we were fascinated by the combination with phosphorescent wheels and decided to offer the Magnic Night Bike as reward, too.</p>
<div data-id=""23021529""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt='Here you see the ""Glow ion the dark"" effect of the Magnic Night Bike wheels.' class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1544747975/sdnezdbhyrxvtaqqwdph.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption>Here you see the ""Glow ion the dark"" effect of the Magnic Night Bike wheels.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p> These are custom made wheels. In addition to the phosphorescent painting these are high quality welded aluminium rims which you only find on upper class roadbikes (like Shimano or Mavic). Even if ""normal"" rims work good with all Magnic Lights these rims are welded and don't have a magnetic rim joint. </p>
<p>You can turn the rear while and either us as free-wheel single speed bike or as FIXE with rigid hub.</p>

<p>The core part is the world’s smallest contact- and frictionless bicycle dynamo, that is integrated together with the electronic and the lighting system in the brake shoe of a calliper brake. The world-wide patented technic developed by the German company Magnic Innovations is based on  eddy current induction: a magnetic wheel in a generator separated from the bicycle rim by a narrow air gap induces temporary magnetic fields even in non-magnetic aluminium bicycle rims when the bicycle rim is moving. This leads to the magnetic wheel rotating contactlessly as if by magic.</p>
<p>Neither batteries nor external cables, further fittings or spoke-magnets are necessary. Only the brake shoes have to be exchanged for microlight - brake shoes, so that the maintenance only involves the exchange of worn brake pads after thousands of kilometres. The included brake pads are compatible with other standard brake pads of other manufacturers as available in every cycle shop.</p>
<p><i><b>Eddy current</b></i></p>
<div data-id=""23372020""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Eddy currents (I, red) induced in a conductive metal plate (C) as it moves to right under a magnet (N)"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1544747979/pjtrljw3z0mqw7klzuou.png"" src=""""/> </a><figcaption><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eddy currents (I, red) induced in a conductive metal plate (C) as it moves to right under a magnet (N)</a></figcaption><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></figure></div>
<p>The key is so-called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">eddy current</a> technology : Energy is drawn from the rotating bicycle wheels without any physical contact, and thus without friction. Instead, eddy currents, created by strong magnets, generate electricity to power the lights: When the wheel spins, magnets inside the generator induce eddy currents with corresponding magnetic fields in the wheel, which in turn interact with the magnets in the generator. The resulting electricity will power your lights indefinitely without any environmentally harmful batteries or cumbersome cables.</p>
<p>While the previous larger Magnic Lights were equipped with two LEDs (one for stand light) Magnic Microlights have just one LED which is fed by ultra-high efficient Mosfet rectifiers.</p>

HOW THE FUTURE CAN BE SMART</h1>
<p>The SMART VERSION presented here can only be realized within the rangeof this project if we reach the stretch goal of 500.000 €.  (In case this amount is reached the reward for the SMART VERSION will be available in the rewards section and you can switch if you like).   <br/>Reason for the high stretch goal: High cost for final development of bluetooth control software &amp; electronics. At the moment we have implemented the main features with prototypes based on the electronic boards and microprocessors of the larger <a href=""http://www.magniclight.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MAGNIC LIGHT IC</a> version.</p>
<p><b><i>Turn Signals  </i></b></p>
<div data-href=""https://youtu.be/OLIE94xaID0""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLIE94xaID0?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" width=""612""></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Smart version comes with a cool novelty : A blink system for turn signals without any additional switches and even without a smartphone. How does it work? If you tap the brake lever the distance between Microlights and rim changes which can be detected in the lights (even without braking). A double-tap is our signal for the blinker: If you double-tap the right brake lever the rear lights detect the signal and via bluetooth to the front lights- so that lights on the right side are blinking. Correspondingly this works on the left side.  </p>
<p><b><i>Navigation  </i></b></p>
<p>Navigation is similar to the turn signals - but here you are guided and need our Smartphone App for navigation: Lights are controlled by the navigation app and start to blink on the left or right side when you have to turn left/right. Put your smartphone in your bag and let the lights guide your way.  </p>
<p><b><i>Speed Data Transmission </i></b>  </p>
<p>The smart Magnic Microlights are equipped with a Bluetooth LE microcontroller which easily detects the rotation speed of your wheel from the incoming current. Via smartphone or Bluetooth LE compatible speedometer you can receive speed data for display or further processing. This feature replaces Bluetooth LE speed sensors which have the same function but need extra mounting and extra batteries.  </p>
<p><b><i>Crash detection with emergency call</i></b>  </p>
<p>This feature requires some future development and is still theory. In case of a crash generators will stop abruptly. We need some test data but we are confident to be able to detect a crash situation reliably which can be sent to the smartphone in order to make an emergency call.  </p>
<p><b><i>Configuraton for Stand light and more </i></b>  </p>
<p>We will offer different stand light patterns which can be set via Smartphone App. Additionally it will be possible to switch the internal orientation of the lights (for example for correct turn signals if your left and right brake levers deviate from standard installations).</p>

<p><i>Nov. 5th 2018, UPDATE </i><br/>Concerning German STVZO approval for our new lighting technology some frustrating years are behind us. But we did not give up and we achieved that the highest responsable committees were invloved in new rules for STVZO approval concerning our technology. Today we were informed that our main ideas could influence the new legislation which shall pass the Verkehrsauschuss (Committee of Transport) of the German Bundestag next month. We believe that the German rules are too complex and old fashioned and hopefully our efforts help to go in the right direction. For our systems (Magnic Light IC, and Magnic Microlights) this is good news because we finally can adjust our lights concerning to these rules.<br/>For our technology here are the three most important new rules concerning Magnic Light:  </p>
<ul>
<li>For lighting systems consisting of two separate lights (left &amp; right) the total amount of light needs to exceed the minimum of 10 lux (and not each single light). (Otherwise our lights should have been twice as bright as the required minimum value at 15km/h while they easily do at &gt;25 km/h) </li>
<li>For lens systems the ""brightest area"" can replace brightest point of the light distribution (which is the measurement point for the light distribution with respect to ""anti-blinding"" characteristics). The highest point within such an the ""brightest area"" can be taken as measurement point now which previously gave room for ambiguity. - </li>
<li>The German bicycle light lobby wanted to have a new rule that prohibits dynamos with less than 50% efficiency. Sounds reasonable but measurements for ""Micro""-system are very complex (and expensive) because the result can be distorted by air resistance, wheel material, bearings, .. much more than these parameters influence large systems (hub dynamos). We could not stop this new rule but at least we could achieve that is is not necessary to prove efficiency charateristics for micro-dynamos below 1,3 Watts. (Background: The rule shall prevent cyclists from exerting too much effort for their dynamo lights- Consequently we should forbid non-aerodynamic clothin for cyclists in future because this costs much more energy ;.) I want to address this to the German Minister for Environment, Svenja Schulze at the Awards Ceromony for the Bundespreis Ecodesign on Nov. 26th in Berlin.</li>

WHY MAGNIC MICROLIGHTS & WEGA ARE GAME CHANGERSCyclists can't escape darkness: It returns every evening and sometimes even at daytime when passing tunnels. Battery lights seem comfortable with quick & easy installation but there will be moments when the batteries are empty while you need them most.With Magnic Microlights you don't have to fear these moments because you have neverending light :Benefits of Magnic Microlights:
Non Contact : You don't feel or hear them
No batteries - Neverending power
Strong enough to enlight the road ahead
Easy To Install 
Cool ""invisible"" design: Compact size without adapters
Environmentally Friendly
Works with all bicycle models - WEGA for disc brakes
Don't mix Magnic Microlights with other bicycle lights: NO SPOKE MAGNETS have to be attached for Magnic Microlights, Wega & Magnic Lights!Magnic Microlights are the world’s smallest non-contact dynamos, that are integrated together with electronics and lighting system in the brake shoes. In 2012 we presented our invention Magnic Light on Kickstarter. Many ""experts"" did not believe this principle can work and believed our lights would be a fake but the MAGIC is clever usage of well known eddy current technology. With more than 17.000 Magnic lights on the road via our successful Magnic Light IC campaign 2014 and our webshop we have proved that this sustainable, environment-friendly technology has the power to replace battery lights for bicycles. 
The last 18 months we worked hard on the development of the Micro-Technology. With Magnic Microlights you can add non-contact dynamo light to your bicycle without need of extra adapters. If your bicycle has disc brakes choose Wega which has flexibility in four directions and fits to nearly all other bikes (except Vbrake/Canti systems), too.  
 3D Printed material, Fully functional contactless generator & PCB Board electronic. 
MAGNIC MICROLIGHT compared to WEGA- THE MICROLIGHT for disc brakes. We named it WEGA because of the similarity with the stellar constellation Lyra and it's brightest star Wega
WEGA might be the most universal bike light on planet earth

HOW CAN THESE TINY LIGHTS BE STRONG?
Beneath generator technology one important aspect is the optimal choice of LED + lens which gives a big advantage compared to normal LED bicycle lights. For the Magnic Microlights we have chosen the newest extreme density - Cree LED (available since summer 2018): The most efficient high power LED with minimum size (1.6 mm x 1.6mm compared to 3.45mm x 3.45mm as used in many LED biycle lights). 
What does this mean for Magnic Microlights? Imagine you have a good bicycle light with 3,45mm x 3,45 mm LED, Lens of size 34,5 mm and 100 Lumen/Watt (These are quite excellent values for biycle lights). 
Magnic Microlights don't have the strongest generators (because cyclists should not feel anything!) but they have the best light efficiency on the market: 200 Lumen/Watt !


2. WHICH REWARD FITS YOUR BIKE?
See the specification here and preorder on the top right of this page.For all Microlights we offer a Roadbike/ Caliper, a Vbrake and a Cantilever version:



 3. LET ANIMATIONS EXPLAIN FUNCTIONS 
We have tested the current brakeshoe design from May to October, 2018 on roadbikes & mountainbikes with more than 3000 test kilometers. Although the stability of the prototype material (3d printed PLA) did not match that of the final product, there was no  difference in braking performance compared to standard brakes that we otherwise use in training and everyday cycling.
 See more details in the gallery... 
TECHNICAL DATA
Our prototypes are less efficient than the final version because of lower generator power. We have to estimate the power of the final product based on the prototypes and our experience from the current Magnic Light version.

BRAKE LIGHT
Magnic Microlights have an effective brake light function. When you pull the brakes the distance between rim and generator decreases resulting in higher generator power and higher light output. The brake light works precisely and is a clear signal for subsequent traffic.
All Magnic Microlights have an integrated ""Brake Light""-function shown here: When you pull the brakes the lights brighten up which warns the driver behind you.
 
BEAM ADJUSTMENT
The design of front-& rearlight allows to adjust the light beam regardless of the fork angle. Even for extreme bicycle frame geometry you can adjust the light beam towards the road.

BRAKE RUBBER REPLACEMENT
Worn brake pads can be exchanged easily as you would expect from standard brakes. 

SHIFT MECHANISM
After longer usage your brakepads will loose up to 5mm material before you have to exchange them. The generator performance stongly depends on the rim distance so we have integrated an automatic shift mechanism to keep the distance between generator and rim constant small. An exchangeable shift-element moves the generator away from the rim and prevents grinding of the generator part.
After longer usage your brakepads will loose up to 5mm material before you have to exchange them. We have integrated an automatic shift mechanism to keep the distance between generator and rim constant which is important for performance of the system.
WEGA VISIBILITY 
Wega is visible from both sides
 See more details in the gallery... 

4. HOW CAN YOUR BIKE GLOW AT NIGHT?
When we tried to assemble the ""perfect"" bicycle for this technology we were fascinated by the combination with phosphorescent wheels and decided to offer the Magnic Night Bike as reward, too.
Here you see the ""Glow ion the dark"" effect of the Magnic Night Bike wheels.
 These are custom made wheels. In addition to the phosphorescent painting these are high quality welded aluminium rims which you only find on upper class roadbikes (like Shimano or Mavic). Even if ""normal"" rims work good with all Magnic Lights these rims are welded and don't have a magnetic rim joint. 
You can turn the rear while and either us as free-wheel single speed bike or as FIXE with rigid hub.


 
See more details in the gallery... 6. FASCINATING TECHNOLOGY & PHYSICS
The main technology of our lights is based on eddy current induction.

 
The core part is the world’s smallest contact- and frictionless bicycle dynamo, that is integrated together with the electronic and the lighting system in the brake shoe of a calliper brake. The world-wide patented technic developed by the German company Magnic Innovations is based on  eddy current induction: a magnetic wheel in a generator separated from the bicycle rim by a narrow air gap induces temporary magnetic fields even in non-magnetic aluminium bicycle rims when the bicycle rim is moving. This leads to the magnetic wheel rotating contactlessly as if by magic.
Neither batteries nor external cables, further fittings or spoke-magnets are necessary. Only the brake shoes have to be exchanged for microlight - brake shoes, so that the maintenance only involves the exchange of worn brake pads after thousands of kilometres. The included brake pads are compatible with other standard brake pads of other manufacturers as available in every cycle shop.
Eddy current
 Eddy currents (I, red) induced in a conductive metal plate (C) as it moves to right under a magnet (N) 
The key is so-called eddy current technology : Energy is drawn from the rotating bicycle wheels without any physical contact, and thus without friction. Instead, eddy currents, created by strong magnets, generate electricity to power the lights: When the wheel spins, magnets inside the generator induce eddy currents with corresponding magnetic fields in the wheel, which in turn interact with the magnets in the generator. The resulting electricity will power your lights indefinitely without any environmentally harmful batteries or cumbersome cables.
While the previous larger Magnic Lights were equipped with two LEDs (one for stand light) Magnic Microlights have just one LED which is fed by ultra-high efficient Mosfet rectifiers.
 7. HOW THE FUTURE CAN BE SMART
The SMART VERSION presented here can only be realized within the rangeof this project if we reach the stretch goal of 500.000 €.  (In case this amount is reached the reward for the SMART VERSION will be available in the rewards section and you can switch if you like).   Reason for the high stretch goal: High cost for final development of bluetooth control software & electronics. At the moment we have implemented the main features with prototypes based on the electronic boards and microprocessors of the larger MAGNIC LIGHT IC version.
Turn Signals  

The Smart version comes with a cool novelty : A blink system for turn signals without any additional switches and even without a smartphone. How does it work? If you tap the brake lever the distance between Microlights and rim changes which can be detected in the lights (even without braking). A double-tap is our signal for the blinker: If you double-tap the right brake lever the rear lights detect the signal and via bluetooth to the front lights- so that lights on the right side are blinking. Correspondingly this works on the left side.  
Navigation  
Navigation is similar to the turn signals - but here you are guided and need our Smartphone App for navigation: Lights are controlled by the navigation app and start to blink on the left or right side when you have to turn left/right. Put your smartphone in your bag and let the lights guide your way.  
Speed Data Transmission   
The smart Magnic Microlights are equipped with a Bluetooth LE microcontroller which easily detects the rotation speed of your wheel from the incoming current. Via smartphone or Bluetooth LE compatible speedometer you can receive speed data for display or further processing. This feature replaces Bluetooth LE speed sensors which have the same function but need extra mounting and extra batteries.  
Crash detection with emergency call  
This feature requires some future development and is still theory. In case of a crash generators will stop abruptly. We need some test data but we are confident to be able to detect a crash situation reliably which can be sent to the smartphone in order to make an emergency call.  
Configuraton for Stand light and more   
We will offer different stand light patterns which can be set via Smartphone App. Additionally it will be possible to switch the internal orientation of the lights (for example for correct turn signals if your left and right brake levers deviate from standard installations).
 8. HOW WE DO POLITICS: GERMAN STVZO   
Nov. 5th 2018, UPDATE Concerning German STVZO approval for our new lighting technology some frustrating years are behind us. But we did not give up and we achieved that the highest responsable committees were invloved in new rules for STVZO approval concerning our technology. Today we were informed that our main ideas could influence the new legislation which shall pass the Verkehrsauschuss (Committee of Transport) of the German Bundestag next month. We believe that the German rules are too complex and old fashioned and hopefully our efforts help to go in the right direction. For our systems (Magnic Light IC, and Magnic Microlights) this is good news because we finally can adjust our lights concerning to these rules.For our technology here are the three most important new rules concerning Magnic Light:  

For lighting systems consisting of two separate lights (left & right) the total amount of light needs to exceed the minimum of 10 lux (and not each single light). (Otherwise our lights should have been twice as bright as the required minimum value at 15km/h while they easily do at >25 km/h) 
For lens systems the ""brightest area"" can replace brightest point of the light distribution (which is the measurement point for the light distribution with respect to ""anti-blinding"" characteristics). The highest point within such an the ""brightest area"" can be taken as measurement point now which previously gave room for ambiguity. - 
The German bicycle light lobby wanted to have a new rule that prohibits dynamos with less than 50% efficiency. Sounds reasonable but measurements for ""Micro""-system are very complex (and expensive) because the result can be distorted by air resistance, wheel material, bearings, .. much more than these parameters influence large systems (hub dynamos). We could not stop this new rule but at least we could achieve that is is not necessary to prove efficiency charateristics for micro-dynamos below 1,3 Watts. (Background: The rule shall prevent cyclists from exerting too much effort for their dynamo lights- Consequently we should forbid non-aerodynamic clothin for cyclists in future because this costs much more energy ;.) I want to address this to the German Minister for Environment, Svenja Schulze at the Awards Ceromony for the Bundespreis Ecodesign on Nov. 26th in Berlin.

For those who do not want to mount heavy dynamos, use batteries or lay cables, we've launched two Kickstarter projects with our non-contact Magnic Lights, which feel like battery lighting without having to exchange or change batteries. Magnic Microlights can't be turned off at daylight and we are convinced this makes sense from a safety point of view: With lights on your visibilty increases significantly which means a great deal of safety.

C'est un logement exposé à l'est le matin, au sud à  midi et à l'Ouest le soir... En effet grâce à sa technologie innovante de suivi solaire, le Réflecteur Intelligent illumine votre habitation toute la journée, dès qu'il y a du soleil.      La lumière naturelle est une source essentielle de bien-être, de confort et de vitalité. Le soleil favorise la sécrétion de la sérotonine qui est l'hormone du bonheur.Dans notre corps, la lumière naturelle favorise aussi la synthèse de la vitamine D qui est un facteur clef d'immunité.     Le Réflecteur Intelligent redirige les rayons du soleil dans votre intérieur pour éclairer votre pièce toute la journée !Véritable concentré de technologie, il est équipé d'un capteur solaire et d'un moteur 2 axes pour suivre les mouvements du soleil en temps réel.      L'exposition au soleil compte pour 10 à 20% de la valeur d'un logement. Pour les acquéreurs et les locataire c'est l'un des tous premiers critères de choix. Ainsi, le Réflecteur Intelligent augmente la valeur de votre logementLe Réflecteur Intelligent s’intègre parfaitement à votre habitat quelque soit sa configuration : appartement, maison, loft...Avec le Réflecteur Intelligent, vous profitez d’un véritable produit de la maison. Conçu pour durer, il est réalisé avec des matériaux nobles et pérennes (inox, aluminium…).Il augmente la luminosité de votre logement sans travaux.   Le Réflecteur Intelligent s'adapte au support disponible là où vous souhaitez le placer pour capter les rayons du soleil.Qu'il s'agisse de la pelouse du jardin, du sol de la terrasse, d'un mur voisin ou de la balustrade du balcon, Espaciel vous propose une solution adaptée.Discret, le Réflecteur Intelligent sait se faire oublier tout en vous apportant soleil et clarté.   Issu de plusieurs années de R&D, le Réflecteur Intelligent fait l'objet d'un brevet Espaciel.Capteur solaire, moteurs électriques, carte électronique, logiciel de pilotage, tous les élément spécifiques du produit ont fait l'objet d'une mise au point minutieuse par notre équipe d'ingénieurs.Placé au soleil, le Réflecteur Intelligent réfléchit les rayons du soleil pour éclairer votre maison, naturellement.  Plus la surface de réflexion est grande plus la quantité de lumière transmises est importante. Le soleil fournit entre 20 000 lux l'hiver et 100 000 lux l'été.Une surface compacte de 35 x 60 cm suffit pour éclairer une pièce de vie de 20 à 30 m2.La surface 35 x 100 cm est parfaitement adaptée pour les pièces de tailles moyennes de 30 à 40 m2.Le Réflecteur Intelligent 50 x 120 cm permet d'illuminer un grand espace de vie de 40 à 60 m2.Au-delà de cette surface, vous pouvez placer un second Réflecteur Intelligent pour  gagner encore plus de luminosité.Bon à savoir : le choix de la dimension du réflecteur dépend aussi de la largeur de l'ouverture de fenêtre ou porte fenêtre. Inutile de prendre un grand réflecteur de 120 cm pour une fenêtre de 60 cm de large.    Nous voulons rendre la lumière naturelle accessible à tous ! Chez Espaciel, nous pensons que tout le monde doit pouvoir bénéficier de cette source de bienfaits essentielle.Il y a quelques années, nous avons inventé le premier kit d'éclairage naturel pour fenêtre et porte-fenêtre. Le réflecteur Espaciel ampliﬁe la luminosité naturelle d'une pièce, comme une fenêtre de toit, mais il est aussi facile à installer qu'un store et ne nécessite aucun travaux.Aujourd'hui, nous avons besoin de vous pour franchir un nouveau cap. Nous nous lançons un défi ultime avec notre produit le plus ambitieux à ce jour : le Réflecteur Intelligent.L'enjeux c'est de rendre le soleil accessible à chacun et de vaincre l'injustice d'un intérieur sombre. Il s'agit de notre quatrième campagne de collecte de fonds participative et du neuvième réflecteur de lumière que nous développons. Nous connaissons les pièges du lancement de nouveaux produits.Néanmoins, l'industrialisation d'un nouveau produit est parsemée d'embuches !Les pièces sont retardées. Les nouveaux prix sont appliqués sans avertissement. Des camions  de pièces détachées sont accidentellement livrés dans l'ancien appartement du fondateur (oui,  cela nous est arrivé).La bonne nouvelle, c'est que nous avons passé ces dernières années à peaufiner notre processus de fabrication, non seulement pour contrôler nos coûts, mais aussi pour améliorer la fiabilité et la qualité de notre mode de production.Nous ne pouvons pas garantir qu'il n'y aura pas de revers, mais nous pensons être mieux équipés que jamais pour y faire face.",71.0,0,"1 Campaign

It includes the HomePower 2 backup battery power station and the SolarPower 2 all-weather portable solar panels. The next generation of affordable backup power solutions designed for every household is here. Turn it on, plug in, and you have power.Discover all the new features here.

 
Hear From the Creative Minds Behind the Innovative Modern DesignWatch as they explain their design for themselves. Celebrity Support for Generark’s Solar Generator and Sustainability MissionFind out why these stars are proud to be supporting Generark in their communities. We can all relate to that moment of panic when the lights go out and the power is unexpectedly shut off. Having a powerful, reliable, and portable backup solution can be a lifesaver! The ability to rest assured that you can keep your fridge cold, mobile devices charged, and medical devices running can be absolutely essential for the entire family, and your community.Generark is the emergency backup generator you need in any and every emergency situation. It gives portable, emergency power whenever and wherever is needed. With an emergency power supply lasting up to seven days, Generark is the reliable source of energy you can count on when disaster strikes by keeping vital home appliances and devices running without interruption. It also powers critical medical devices, power tools, and communication devices to stay connected during a power outage and time of recovery after disaster strikes.  How Does It Work?The Generark Solar Generator includes a backup battery power station (HomePower 2) and all-weather portable solar panels (SolarPower 2). The solar panels collect the sun’s rays and convert them into energy, which is then stored in the backup battery power station. The backup battery power station can store and hold the electricity for at least a year. When the time comes, it then supplies electricity to other devices and appliances via the standard AC output (110V) and various DC outputs (USB-A, USB-C, and car outlet) when power is needed. Generark’s SolarPower 2 offers 50% higher solar power conversion efficiency than traditional solar panels, allowing you to harness and convert the sun’s rays in less time. Paired with our HomePower 2 backup battery power station, you have the ability to power a wide range of home appliances and devices.If the sun is somehow unavailable, the HomePower 2 can also be charged from a variety of sources, including the AC outlets, the traditional gas generator, or directly with a car outlet. No matter the emergency situation, Generark Solar Generators are designed to give you reliable backup power that you can count on. Supports 99% of Home Appliances with 2200-Watts of PowerGenerark HomePower 2 comes with two models, choose the best fit for your family from Starter at 1566WH or Plus at 2060WH. The HomePower 2 - Plus offers a 2200W continuous high power output and 4400W of surge power at 110V/60Hz, which is able to power 99% of home appliances. With 20-amp AC outlets, you can power common kitchen and bathroom devices like a Crockpot and hairdryer.The HomePower 2 has a Pure-Sine Wave inverter that is capable of producing a cleaner, smoother, quieter, and more reliable electricity to operate appliances and electronics more comfortably without interference. The energy output is regulated and changes smoothly, with the ability to power many commonly used devices like televisions, LED lights, microwaves, laser printers, variable speed tools, and more.Watch the HomePower 2 powering up a high-power blender. 

 
High Compatibility with 9 Simultaneous OutputsThe HomePower 2 (Plus) has four 20-amp AC outlets, making it extremely powerful. You can power up multiple devices at one time such as a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, medical device, toaster, and more!The HomePower 2 is equipped with two USB-C outlets with PD 100W and two USB-A outlets certified by Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 so it can connect and power up your Mac directly, and provide ultra fast recharge to your smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices.There is also a car outlet with 12V/10A for easy and convenient supplying power for any automobile accessories. Connect and power your phone, portable GPS navigation system, sound system, and portable video players for kids to stay occupied while you’re on the road by car or RV! Up to 7 Days of Essential PowerThe Generark HomePower 2 offers up to 7 days of emergency power. A single charge will power your essential devices for up to one week including, but not limited to, Home Appliances, Communication Devices, Home Offices, Medical Devices, Lights, Power Tools, and more. * The chart above visualizes how you can best use your HomePower 2 when facing a power outage. Each line explains the average wattage range of a supported home device, and how long the HomePower 2 would be able to power that one device on a single charge, abiding by our assumed average usage times. Note, if you choose to power more than one device on a single charge of your HomePower 2, your battery supply will drain sooner than the noted total usage time frame.  Continuous Coverage Enabled by Ultra-Fast RechargeThe Generark Solar Generator is reliable and ready to help you endure any natural disaster. It has a built-in Maximum-Power Point Tracking (MPPT) charge controller that enables the fastest and most efficient recharge by the solar panels. By the SolarPower 2 solar panels (800W), the HomePower 2 backup battery power station will be at 80% after 2 hours, and 100% fully charged within 3-4 hours. Out of the average 8 hours of sunlight a day, Generark Solar Generators only require 3-4 hours to recharge fully by solar power. This means you can have peace of mind, and there is no reason to worry about not having enough sunlight.Your Generark can also be easily recharged by the AC wall outlet with 1000-Watts of ultra fast recharging speed. It will be at 80% after just 1.5 hours, and 100% in just a little over 2 hours.If you have a gas generator already, you can easily connect, power, and recharge your Generark with it. This is a convenient way to use a device you already have, and then use your Generark indoors safely without emitting any harmful gas or loud noises.Should solar, AC or wall, and gas generators not be available, you can always rely on your car as a last resort to charge your Generark.You can recharge your Generark by solar and use it at the same time, so Generark has the ability to provide continuous power throughout the day and a full charge to get through the night! Being able to recharge quickly and still have continuous power while charging is crucial to get through a natural disaster and emergency situation. No matter the emergency situation, Generark Solar Generators are designed to give you reliable backup power that can be recharged quickly and easily from a variety of different sources. Generark Solar Generators make this not just possible, but easy. All-Weather Portable Solar PanelsEach SolarPower 2 panel consists of 64 Monocrystalline solar cells (SunPower Maxeon Gen III), offering 50% higher solar power conversion efficiency compared to traditional solar panels. The SunPower solar cells were invented at Stanford University and are made in the USA.The SolarPower 2 is lightweight and foldable. Its portable design allows for easy setup and transportation so you can move it conveniently through your home and easily take it with you on the go. With the adjustable kickstand, it takes 30 seconds or less to set up or take down for quick access during an emergency.The SolarPower 2 is, perhaps, most importantly, an all-weather solar panel with IP67 waterproof rating. Natural disasters bring on any elements - storms, rain, heat, wind, and more. The SolarPower 2 allows you to confidently face any of these disaster elements and situations, and more. Unprecedented Design by Renowned DesignersThe Generark Solar Generator is designed right here in the United States out of San Francisco, California, by Bill Webb and Patrick Tufts, renowned designers behind many of the most iconic products (including Gopro, Sonos, Nike, etc.) used by millions of consumers across the globe. Sleek Design for Your Modern HomeA lot of thought went into the design of the HomePower 2. We wanted a modern and iconic design that fits every home and every need, whether you’re enduring an emergency situation or hosting a house party. We created the exceptionally sleek design to not look like most portable generators. It is visually elevated and on-par with premium accessories that are commonplace in the modern home.  Vertical Design with Minimal FootprintWe intentionally designed the HomePower 2 in a vertical format with a waist-level height. It is designed to just stand on the ground, and eliminates the need and effort of lifting it up to table tops and elevated surfaces. It is also more compact, taking up less space and leaving a smaller footprint no matter where you use it in or outside the home. We want you to be able to just stand it on the ground where and when you need it, then easily move the portable generator to either its next space for use or storage.   Integrated Ergonomic HandleWe made the HomePower 2 with a top embedded waist-height handle making the device easy to carry and move from location to location. Easily take the device with you to neighbors’ houses or as you move from room to room in your own home.  Magic Wheel CartThe Magic Wheel Cart is designed with convenience in mind. It allows the HomePower 2 to be moved effortlessly by anyone, any age. The wheel cart is removable, and magnets help it snap back into place. The design of the wheel cart was something we really felt strongly about. During an unexpected blackout, we wanted the HomePower 2 to be able to move quickly and effortlessly. We felt it was an essential user benefit. Intelligent DisplayWe integrated the HomePower 2 with a large LCD screen. It has an intuitive interface that gives real-time status on power input and output. It shows the input and output wattage, so you know the exact load of power going through the unit. The estimated hours to fully recharge the unit and the estimated remaining hours to use give you an intuitive and easy way to plan your usage without doing any math!  360-Degree Ambient LED LightWe added an ambient LED light around the perimeter of the HomePower 2. It lights up in the dark to help you stay safe and avoid wire tripping. It is also color coded to inform you of battery and charge levels, with yellow indicating <10% and red, <5%.In an emergency situation, the light will communicate the status and power level and can be seen from across the room. At a glance, you get the peace of mind knowing the device is fully powered and working properly.  Why Generark?Generark Solar Generators are reliable, durable, and portable.

Our experts conduct research to better understand our consumers’ needs, and develop new features that can target these and any other potential problems or pain points.Stage 2: Prototyping & EngineeringIn this phase, our engineers go through many rounds of prototyping and designs to combat any rising problems before finalizing a design and features.Stage 3: Validation & TestingIn this final stage, the finished product goes through various safety and reliability tests to validate if it’s ready for market. About GenerarkFrom wildfires to earthquakes, from hurricanes to winter storms, millions of people across the country have experienced many power outages as the result of a natural disaster, leading to feelings of shock and uncertainty. With climate change seemingly here to stay, these types of natural disasters and power outages will only continue to occur, leaving us all prone to facing more emergency situations.The story goes that when the entire world flooded, only Noah’s Ark sustained life. Generark aims to be your ark, your source of security in any emergency situation, by providing a reliable source of power that will enable you to keep your home protected and running, allow you to stay connected to your loved ones, and encourages you to collaborate with your community by sharing resources.Generark was founded in 2019 out of the devastating California wildfires that left thousands without power, and even homeless. With a newborn at home, our founder quickly realized the need for a working refrigerator to supply crucial nutrients to both baby and mother, regardless of the natural disaster and its aftermath unfolding around them. Beyond his own family, many of his friends and neighbors were left without a roof over their heads, seeking rest in cars or public shelters because their homes and belongings completely burned to the ground.As a serial entrepreneur in the technology industry and energy sector, our founder has now taken the future into his own hands, developing a product that will help everyone take back control in the face of an emergency. Generark products are here to ensure anyone can stay prepared during emergency situations, and continue to evolve, develop, and change with the ever-changing climate and natural disaster-prone times we live in today.SustainabilityClimate change is constant and only growing, posing an increased threat of new, worse, and more damaging natural disasters every year. With the uncertainty of climate change here to stay, Generark provides a reliable, durable, and portable solution to get through natural disasters when they strike.At Generark, we are committed to making a positive impact on climate change in everything we do. The solar technology we have created allows you as the consumer to help leave a positive impact as well. Every time you use a Generark Solar Generator instead of another backup power source requiring gas or a worse stimulant, you leave a smaller carbon footprint.The vision of Generark is centered around collaborating to provide protection and connection to our community. Part of protecting that community is educating one another about climate change and how we can make an impact with simple lifestyle changes like recycling, sustainable products, and using solar energy!Our mission is to keep your beautiful life powered through any emergency situation. Generark Solar Generators provide a way and space to do just that, not just by keeping your beautiful life powered, but allowing you to embrace beauty as it is in its natural form, from the sun and solar power.Join Generark on our mission to bring the most efficient, affordable, and sustainable emergency power to a world that's never needed it more. Never Lose Power Again.

No less than 7 failsafe systems are built into FROST 5000’s electrical design to protect you and your devices. FCC, CE, RoHS and UN38.3 safety certifications will be completed to provide assurance and peace of mind. Due to additional safety procedures, costs are prohibitively high for air shipments containing lithium ion batteries. We have identified the specialized logistics provider Easyship to assist us in getting FROST SUMMITS into your pockets asap.For US fulfillment, rewards will first be sent via sea (which takes around 18 days or more) from our factory in China to a US port and then be shipped to US addresses via Easyship tracked shipping. US based backers are expected to receive rewards within 3-8 days from the port. For the rest of the world, we need to check with our international shipping advisers, and we will be communicating how we will ship direct from China.Policies by Country:Legal variances from country to country, regulations vary significantly across regions and countries, especially for electronic goods. We will take every precaution in ensuring that our product and shipping policies meet with local legislation in all areas, but we will let you know if there is any problem with your delivery.Defective products and returns: It is our responsibility to make sure we deliver the best products we could to our customers. There might still be some issues that we need to overcome along the way to get this product ready for mass production. If you do receive a defective product that falls below expectations, you have 20 days from the receive day to contact us and we will send you a replacement ASAP.",50.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Second round - investors funding</h2>
<p>Hi there, I am Alex with the megacell charger project. In this video, I want to talk about what we have accomplished and how we plan to scale this project. This video is not for regular users, and it's intended for people looking to invest money in this project.</p>
<p>Before I tell you the deal I have in mind for investors, let me briefly present the project.</p>
<p>The Megacell Charger is a testing device for lithium cells intended to measure new or used cells' capacity. We created this device to speed up and help automate the tedious process of measuring lithium cells before building battery packs.</p>
<p>To create a well-balanced battery pack, you need to make sure that all the cells are in good condition and that you know their capacity before welding them together.</p>
<p>More people and recycling companies started recovering lithium cells from used batteries in the last couple of years. More than 80% of cells are still in good condition, but you need a way to filter which cells can be reused and find their actual capacity before placing them back into batteries.</p>
<p>We created the Megacell Charger to speed up the process, making cell recovery worth it. The hardware works hand in hand with the software we created. This live connection allows logging the results into a database and helps printing labels for cells to further automate the sorting and the pack creation process.</p>
<p>In 2020 we created a crowdfunding campaign to help get this project off the ground and see how many people are interested in such a device. The campaign was a success, and we shipped over 700 devices already, over 1000 devices including the alpha stage that we ran in 2019.</p>
<p>We got down the manufacturing and shipping process, and we are now ready to scale this.</p>
<p>This video is intended for investors because we plan to make stocks in Europe, Asia, and USA before moving forward with this project's marketing.</p>
<p>We sold over 700 devices in 3 months, taking into account that they were pre-orders, and a lot of people did not want to take the risk.</p>
<p>At the end of January, we have received a stock of 100 devices in Romania, and they sold out in less than 14 days with minimum marketing.</p>
<p>The feedback we got from people is excellent, and the requests are rising every day.</p>
<p>Here's the proposal I want to make to you:</p>
<p>We aim to raise money for a batch of 2000 devices.</p>
<p>We created three investing packages:</p>
<p>Ten devices</p>
<p>Fifty devices and 100 devices.</p>
<p>The bulk price per device is 110 Euro, and the reselling price is 146 Euro.</p>
<p><strong>There are two options to benefit from this investment:</strong></p>
<p>The first option is to ship the devices to you, and you take care of selling and fulfillment. Reselling for at least 146 Euro e piece will give you a 32.72% return on your investment. This is the price at which we sold the 100 devices we received this year in stock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second option is to keep the stock and pay you between 13 to 17% interest on your investment in 6 to 8 months.</p>
<p>For the quantity of 10 to 49 devices, we offer 13% interest on your investment</p>
<p>For 50 to 99 devices, it will be 15%, and for 100+ devices, we will offer 17% interest.</p>
<p>Manufacturing takes three months, and we estimate that it will take another 2 to 4 months to sell all the stock and pay everyone their money back plus interest.</p>
<p>I want to clarify that this is a one-time deal, we will not split profits of any further sales after we pay the investment money back and the interest we promised. There might be the option to reinvest in the future, but I would like to keep the discussion simple for now.</p>
<p>Keeping money in a bank will give you 1% or less per year, and we offer you the possibility of investing in a proven project that gives you up to 17% interest in less than a year.</p>
<p>We are in the process of certifying the devices, and we already established manufacturing, testing, and packing workflow with the factory.</p>
<p>We have contracts with fulfillment companies, and we are just waiting for stock. The hard part of the project passed, and there are no other risks for this project to go wrong.</p>
<p>I am confident that this project will scale very well, with all the batteries around, electronic cigarettes, e-scooters, e-bikes, electric vehicles, toys, etc.</p>
<p>The market is vast, and the venture of reusing and repairing these batteries is on the rise. Having a testing device is mandatory for repairing these lithium batteries to detect which cells have problems and needs replacing.</p>
<p>We stopped receiving pre-orders from regular users, and we are now focusing on a campaign to mass sell these devices. But to keep things moving fast, we must build a stock first.</p>
<p>If you are the kind of person that likes having money working for him, this project is the right choice for you.</p>
<p>Pick any of the perks on the right side of this page, and during checkout, you have the option to add shipping to it or not.</p>
<p>If you choose to get it shipped, there will be an extra shipping fee, and we will send the devices to your address and not pay any interest in your investment.</p>
<p>If you don't choose to get the devices shipped, we will keep them and sell them through our marketing channels and offer you between 13 to 17% interest and your money-back once the devices are sold.</p>
<p>We will pay the commissions and the initial investment money back in the order the investments were received. The payments will be sent through PayPal or wire transfer when the time comes.</p>
<p>I estimate it to take between 6 to 8 months until you receive your investment back plus interest.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about this project, about the features we implemented, how it got started, please watch the other videos on Indiegogo or in the video description.</p>
<p>We gathered feedback from users and implemented it into the hardware and the software of this device. If you search youtube, you will find well-known YouTubers like Jehu Garcia that reviewed this device and gave their opinion.</p>
<p>When you are ready, please choose the right level you want to get in, and let's continue building this project together.</p>
<p>We plan to keep the investment window open for two weeks. After this period, we will close the campaign and begin manufacturing this batch.</p>
<p>As I said before, we will pay the money back plus interest in the perks' order. So being between the first will allow you to get back your investment faster. You are cashing in the first month when we receive the devices in stock.</p>
<p>The minimum order is already reached at the factory, we will purchase 150 devices ourselves, so there will be no issues for not meeting the minimum order.</p>
<p>We purchased first, but we will collect the money last. Investors will have priority in collecting their investment back plus the interest.</p>
<p>I hope you will choose to work with us on this project and make money together while providing a great device that reduces electronics waste and gives others the possibility of earning money while helping the environment.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at <a href=""mailto:alex@megacellcharger.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">alex@megacellcharger.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you intend to invest in purchasing more than 100 devices, get in touch and discuss the details.</p>

<h3>Megacellcharger Funding Milestones</h3>
<p>$34 000 – Minimum Goal<br/>Reaching the minimum goal will allow us to produce the new PCB design and to pay for a plastic injection mold to produce the plastic case instead of 3D printing it and 300 trees planted.</p>
<p>$70 000 – Great Goal<br/>Create packaging that includes printed documentation, USB stick with video instructions, protective foam shaped for the charger, power supply and wires to fit in and 650 trees planted.</p>
<p>Apart from redesigning the 3D version of the charger, I also took the time to 3D print and fully assembly the new version to make sure everything fits in properly.</p>
<p>Here’s the list of features that we’ve got into Megacellcharger so far:</p>
<p>It has a capacity of 16 cells</p>
<p>It allows independent charging and discharging</p>
<p>You can set the discharge rate between 100 to 1000 mAh</p>
<p>It charges with up to 1 amp per cell with a specialized chip to ensure a proper and safe charging</p>
<p>It detects low voltage cells starting from 1 volt and attempts a slow recovery until reaching 3 volts then it continues normally until fully charged.</p>
<p>We have implemented a workflow that allows setting multiple charge / discharge cycles and charging back to a voltage that’s safe for storing or transportation to comply with the newest DOT and IATA regulations</p>
<p>There’s software available for Desktop, IOS and Android to manage the charger</p>

<p>While our main area of expertise is not testing equipment, using our programming and hardware development past experience helped us to quickly get a great product together and we are still not done with the improvements yet.</p>
<p>But we need your help now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to get this project to mass production which includes proper assembly line, quality testing and packing, we must reach $34 000 worth of orders or above to get a good deal from the factory and afford the plastic injection molds that will allow creating a high quality case for the hardware.</p>
<p>The actual minimum amount the factory asked for is $39 000, but if we reach the goal we set, I will be more than happy to put in the remaining $5000 and push this project for mass production.</p>
<p>For me this project is more than a product that I can produce and sell for a profit. It represents a way to improve a process that has the potential to save lots of wasted materials and resources that have been used to produce these batteries.</p>
<p>I am not a big environmental activist, but if I see a way to improve things and I can help with that, I will definitely go for it.</p>
<p>The way I see it, is that if the testing process is simple and fast enough, more and more people will begin testing these cells, giving them a second life and lowering the demand for producing new cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To make this project even more environmentally helpful, I have decided with my team to work on a plan that will allow us to plant a tree for each Megacellcharger that we sell. We already come up with a plan to build a planting tree device that uses electric power and I think it will be a lot of fun to build. We will share the plans of the device soon as we already begin working on making this happen.</p>
<p>So for each Megacellcharger sold and for each pledge over $10, we are going to plant a tree. We are going to film the process and show what we come up with for planting trees efficiently and eco friendly without using any gas generators or gas engines.</p>
<p>I hope you will find this idea as interesting as we did and that you can help us make it happen. If you cannot afford purchasing an item, sharing this page and the video is another way you can help us to reach our goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are interested in supporting this project, you can choose a reward from the right side of this page or go to megacellcharger.com if you happen to watch this video on youtube on or other platforms.</p>
<p>On the right side you will find all the rewards that we thought it will make sense for you.</p>
<p>If you happen to need a different type of reward, like getting us to install these chargers on a facility for you or doing a live call to explain how the system will work, feel free to reach me at alex@megacellcharger.com and we will find a way to help you out.</p>

Here are a few risks and challenges:</p><p>Manufacturing: We have our own final assembly plant, but the sub-manufacturing suppliers are going to need our quality assurance people on site during production. There are a lot of parts that come together for GoSun Brew and Power, so this will require a lot of coordination.</p><p>Delays: Given the global COVID situation, disruptions could occur with various suppliers or deliveries, but we have been working with all our relationships since the middle of 2020 and we are confident that delays will be minimal, if at all.</p><p>Fulfillment: Power 266 is considered a dangerous good for air travel so we have to ship via sea and road. Sometimes things happen that can’t be planned for - a supplier misses a deadline or a shipment gets lost. These unknowns could cause a delay. We are using an experienced logistics team to get our products to you and we’ll maintain open communication with you throughout our process.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Environmental commitments</strong></h3><p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p><p>High grade materials like stainless steel and 100% silicone.

Every Power 266 comes with the ability to charge with an AC Adapter (included) and with USB-C. Each battery comes with two DC powercords and eight common DC adapters for appliances such as: laptops, air compressors, fans, lights, routers, speakers, vacuums, electronics, cameras, etc.  

Just 3 pounds. Enough energy to recharge the average laptop four times or the average cell phone up to 20 times, GoSun Power is built to pack as much energy into the smallest form possible.

Power 5 devices at once. Power 266 is equipped to run your laptop, several phones, and your portable fridge all at the same time and all day long.

Recharge with the Sun. GoSun knows solar and we make sure you can rely on the Sun to get the job done.  No other powerbank integrates solar with such ease and efficiency.

5X your laptop battery. Your laptop, tablet and phone work hard these days and with Power 266 you have the ability to recharge over and over.  

Adjustable DC outlet. Lets you put power into your electronics at the voltage they require. This expands beyond laptops to include devices such as: modems, routers, speakers, lights, pumps, motors, other powerbanks, etc. 
Not sure if your laptop can be run off Power? GoSun will help you find the right powercord or adapter for your device.  GoSun is here to bring Portable Power for the People, so we’ve made Power 266 to travel with you. Toss it in a backpack, the included Carry Case or the Power Pouch (included with Solar Table and Chill) that fit GoSun Brew and tons of other accessories.  It's the age of innovation, yet we are still burning fuels to make electricity and brew coffee.  Now, we have the ability to harness the Sun’s power better than ever, taking generators, extension cords and gas stoves out of the equation.  GoSun engineered an energy package that runs all your devices, minimizes complexity and can always be recharged with solar.

Carry the sun. portable and compact.

Harness in seconds. unfold and absorb power.

Solar brew, solar cool and solar cook. No ice, no fuel, no flames, no mess.
Capable of brewing eight cups of coffee in one charge, GoSun Power holds 266 Watt Hours or 72,000mAH of lithium ion stored energy. For its size, it stores a huge amount of energy, and it's very easy to recharge again and again.   The 15 Amp, 12 volt power outlet is powerful enough to run an air compressor, CPAP machine, appliances and our very own GoSun Chill, Portable Fridge, and GoSun Fusion, Hybrid Solar Oven that can cook at night. You never know when you’ll need a flashlight. Instead of relying on your phone’s light, the Power 266's light is eight times brighter and it lasts for days. Since Power 266 fits in your hand, it functions as a flashlight better than most flashlights. Recharge with either the AC Adapter (included), an USB-C or one of three solar options. Refill in as little as 4 hours. The above estimated charge times consider a fully depleted battery.   We all want to live more independent, healthy and resilient lives.

  GoSun has become known as one of the world’s top manufacturers of innovative solar products that can cook, cool, charge, clean, light and purify-- and now with the GoSun Brew and Power 266, you can brew fresh coffee and charge your electronics.This is our ninth crowdfunding project, and we always deliver. GoSun has become a leader in  breakthrough solar technologies that make outdoor, healthy and clean living a reality through innovation and thoughtful design...and lots of coffee.Risks and challengesGoSun has been working for months to get this product ready for production. Here are a few risks and challenges:Manufacturing: We have our own final assembly plant, but the sub-manufacturing suppliers are going to need our quality assurance people on site during production. There are a lot of parts that come together for GoSun Brew and Power, so this will require a lot of coordination.Delays: Given the global COVID situation, disruptions could occur with various suppliers or deliveries, but we have been working with all our relationships since the middle of 2020 and we are confident that delays will be minimal, if at all.Fulfillment: Power 266 is considered a dangerous good for air travel so we have to ship via sea and road. Sometimes things happen that can’t be planned for - a supplier misses a deadline or a shipment gets lost. These unknowns could cause a delay. We are using an experienced logistics team to get our products to you and we’ll maintain open communication with you throughout our process. Environmental commitmentsLong-lasting designHigh grade materials like stainless steel and 100% silicone. Carry Case for safe storage and organization. Simple, durable electronics to minimize failures.Reusability and recyclabilityRechargeable batteries paired with solar panels for maximum cycling and longevity. The vast majority of lithium ion batteries are recycled. Also, this campaign eliminates waste from coffee cups, filters, K-cups and fuel canisters.Sustainable materialsAvoiding the use of fossil fuels is critical. Solar energy is far more valuable than energy made from coal, natural gas, nuclear, oil or fire, because it is cleaner, more direct and has very little externalized cost.Environmentally friendly factoriesGoSun is very careful in choosing suppliers with high environmental standards. Additionally, our manufacturing partners maintain a strong worker's rights program to ensure people are safe and comfortable.Sustainable DistributionNo air travel will be used in the fulfillment of this project. Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ",50.0,1,"9 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Starting in a classroom project at UT-Austin, we came together to tackle the challenge of food waste occurring in grocery stores. After many rounds of observations and interviews, we discovered a major issue in grocers - there was an apparent lack of granular data about their waste. Tapping into our STEM backgrounds, we wanted to leverage the power of data and technology and fill the knowledge gap. We are currently testing and building a data collection and analysis tool called the Throw-A-Weigh. Your donations will support our mission of empowering grocers to make data-driven decisions for reducing their food waste.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We're asking for $6,000 to put towards prototyping and product development. We currently have a low-fidelity, hacked-together-in-a-garage prototype that has some basic functionality, but we want to work with the UT Mechanical Engineering senior design program to design and assemble a higher-fidelity prototype with some bells and whistles (i.e., additional sensors,  sleeker industrial design, ability to sort produce based on quality, etc.). Working with a senior design team costs $5,000, and we're padding an additional $1,000 to put towards prototyping materials.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every year, <strong>5 billion pounds</strong> of produce goes to waste, a <strong>$16 billion dollar</strong> cost. For individual stores, they lose 12% of their produce section, an average of $7 million per year. From our conversations with produce managers, account managers, buyers, and directors in grocery stores, as well as other experts and entrepreneurs working in tandem on the issue of food waste, it is clear that this has been an ongoing issue with no clear solution in sight. Food waste is so ubiquitous that it has become a part of ""doing business,"" to the point that some believe waste is a sign of <i>good</i> business. We're here to change that and show that you can solve food waste <i><u>and</u> </i>still be profitable. Data is not the ultimate solution to fighting food waste, but it is a starting point for identifying preventive solutions. As they say, you can't measure what you don't know.</p>
<p>On top of food waste being a waste of land, water, fertilizer, transportation, and other resources, it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, totaling up to 8% of global greenhouse gases. In the U.S., food waste is the single largest category of material (24%) in landfills, where landfills contribute 20% of total U.S. methane emissions. According to Project Drawdown’s modeling of “plausible and economically realistic” climate change solutions, reducing food waste is the <strong><i>#1 solution</i></strong> when it comes to reducing carbon dioxide emissions (projected 87.45 gigatons CO2 reduced between 2020-2050). With the urgency of climate change and the ever-growing necessity to avoid the 2°C global temperature increase, we believe it is imperative to implement any and all solutions that will slow down greenhouse gas emissions. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is to raise CAD 12,800 to last the next 4 months (until mid-late August).  We expect our negotiations with the investors to have concluded by that time, in one way or another:</p>
<p>$6000 to 7500 - Short-term cash requirements (especially related to end of year taxes, licenses, etc)</p>
<p>$5000 to 7000 - Legal set-up of Manitoba investment fund</p>
<p>Because this is a new approach and has many regulatory uncertainties in front of it, I am raising the first block of funds primarily from long-time friends/colleagues. </p>
<p>If you don’t know me already, Your voice in this is super important because this is the first time we are introducing this to the market.  I’ll be excited to hear from you and will be sure to keep you posted on developments as they come together.</p> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Growing up in Northern BC, I had front row seats to the early evidence of the destructive nature of GHG-induced climate change.  During high-school, I watched entire forests turn red and die from unhampered mountain-pine beetle infestations.  By the time I finished my geology degree in 2012 more than half of BC’s lodgepole pine forests had already been killed by the beetles.  Several years later 2018 and 2019 were both historic record years for fires in the province. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617952090/jrl98ry8xsn79fbjnpxr.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Besides electricity generation, transportation is the second largest source of GHG emissions in most countries.  One of the common criticisms of electric vehicles today is that in a coal-dominated power grid, rapid introduction of electric vehicles may actually lead to an increase in GHG.  In wealthier countries, highway rated vehicles consume far more electricity per km than can be produced by a solar array of a similar footprint.  However, in the low-speed vehicles commonly used in countries such as the Philippines, a local solar array is much more attractive.  We anticipate generating 60-80% of energy requirements on islands with stable, reliable grids and are excited to get to 100% solar on more rural and remote islands.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Main Drivers for the fund</h3>
<p>Filipinos in Canada are crucial to this picture for 2 reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being much more environmentally conscious and aware than most in Philippines (especially rural)</li>
<li>Having the purchasing power to do something about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remittances from overseas workers are a major driver of economic development in countries like the Philippines (10-15% of GDP).  These flows are generally conducted through informal channels such as Western Union.  However, many of these funds are eventually invested into private land transportation vehicles.  My informal surveys over the years have revealed more Canadian flags on Filipino jeepneys than any flags from any other country.  So this kind of investment is already happening today.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617952510/w0cc4urkgweupnyf4px6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The regulations around traditional crowdfunding (ie Indiegogo) prohibit giving financial rewards to backers.  In recent years, Canadian securities regulations have been expanded to accommodate equity crowdfunding.  However, investment funds are not accommodated within this provision.  What this probably means, in practical terms, is that our planned fund will not qualify for the prospectus exemption given to companies currently licensed for equity crowdfunding.  For more information about the current state of Canadian equity crowdfunding regulations, please check here: <a href=""https://ncfacanada.org/equity-crowdfunding-regulations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ncfacanada.org/equity-crowdfunding-regu...</a></p> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

365 days per year
>99.9% service level uptime
~30% ROI
Passed 100 000 rides within first 12 months of operation


These results led to us becoming among the first labelled solutions of the Solar Impulse Foundation is SE Asia.  As a group of avid outdoors-men and adventurers, we are supremely grateful for the chance to keep such inspiring company.

    The transportation industry was hit very hard by Covid in 2020 and our pilot project was no exception.  Towards the end of 2020, we elected to consolidate our resources, relocate to the nearby city where we have the strongest relationships (Calamba, Laguna) and pivot our focus towards the higher-level long-term requirements of the industry such as supply chain and manufacturing.

At the end of the day, I am faced with the choice of:

borrowing more funds  OR
walking away from the past 5 years of blood, sweat and tears which have been poured into  sunE

I still strongly believe sunE is going to pave the way to low-carbon transportation for this sector.  So clearly, I am pursuing option 1.

Besides electricity generation, transportation is the second largest source of GHG emissions in most countries.  One of the common criticisms of electric vehicles today is that in a coal-dominated power grid, rapid introduction of electric vehicles may actually lead to an increase in GHG.  In wealthier countries, highway rated vehicles consume far more electricity per km than can be produced by a solar array of a similar footprint.  However, in the low-speed vehicles commonly used in countries such as the Philippines, a local solar array is much more attractive.  We anticipate generating 60-80% of energy requirements on islands with stable, reliable grids and are excited to get to 100% solar on more rural and remote islands.
 
Main Drivers for the fund
Filipinos in Canada are crucial to this picture for 2 reasons:

Being much more environmentally conscious and aware than most in Philippines (especially rural)
Having the purchasing power to do something about it.

Remittances from overseas workers are a major driver of economic development in countries like the Philippines (10-15% of GDP).  These flows are generally conducted through informal channels such as Western Union.  However, many of these funds are eventually invested into private land transportation vehicles.  My informal surveys over the years have revealed more Canadian flags on Filipino jeepneys than any flags from any other country.  So this kind of investment is already happening today.

 
Risks & Challenges
The regulations around traditional crowdfunding (ie Indiegogo) prohibit giving financial rewards to backers.  In recent years, Canadian securities regulations have been expanded to accommodate equity crowdfunding.  However, investment funds are not accommodated within this provision.  What this probably means, in practical terms, is that our planned fund will not qualify for the prospectus exemption given to companies currently licensed for equity crowdfunding.  For more information about the current state of Canadian equity crowdfunding regulations, please check here: https://ncfacanada.org/equity-crowdfunding-regu... Other Ways You Can Help

<p>We hate to say it, but not everyone has a green thumb. Gardening at any scale, indoors or outdoors, is a <strong>complex and time-consuming process.</strong> Even if you take your time to research gardening tools and techniques and go through what can sometimes be a trial-and-error process of learning how to garden, worthwhile yields are never guaranteed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Plus, would-be gardeners are often at the <strong>mercy of the seasons</strong>, their local environment, and all manner of unforeseen,<strong> unpredictable factors that can turn a productive hobby into a laborious chore.</strong></p>
<p>We created boombi in an attempt to <strong>simplify the entire growing process</strong> by removing the unnecessary and delivering the essential: light, water, and nutrients. </p>

<h3>So why not just pick up your produce at the local market?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, the truth is that even your local market might not carry “local” produce. Many of the fruits and vegetables we buy at the store <strong>travel thousands of kilometers</strong> to get into our shopping carts, only to spoil quickly and wind up in the wastebasket at home.</p>

<p>Groots was founded in 2018 with the mission of growing local and healthy food in a sustainable and innovative way. Our first breakthrough towards achieving our mission came when we developed our own vertical farming system in a forty square meter garage and began selling produce to local establishments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605091010/boxqatu0i5xo5mycnzwc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Demand for our fresh produce soon exceeded our ability to produce it. At the same time, several of our customers inquired if we could build custom farming systems for them. This is how our first Boombi—designed for use in hotels and restaurants—was born. After the first successful installation of a Boombi system in a restaurant in Barcelona (OrganiQ), we continued to refine the design of our system. The goal was to get the Boombi into homes around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605091045/t13smgfifnzs541cvf5d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In March 2020, we finally cracked the design on a 28-plant system. However, we still wanted to make the Boombi even <strong>more</strong> accessible and efficient. The result of that design process is Boombi Mini, now available on Indiegogo.</p>

</div></div>","Boombi is a self-contained, user-friendly hydroponic vertical garden that will revolutionize the way you grow and consume food. 
 
  
Boombi is modular, easy to use, and built to the highest manufacturing standards. From the moment Boombi arrives at your front door, you’ll be ready to start growing your own fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs, and much more. It’s as easy as using a coffee machine! 
 

 
 
Funded in less than 24h in Kickstarter!



 

Boombi won't be here for Christmas season- but we've got you covered!!
We don't want you to show up to the Christmas dinner empty-handed so we'll be sending you a printable personalized gift card for your beloved one! 
We can also send the lucky person an e-mail You'll just have to specify the name and language in the Survey once the campaign is finalized!
 



 

 
We hate to say it, but not everyone has a green thumb. Gardening at any scale, indoors or outdoors, is a complex and time-consuming process. Even if you take your time to research gardening tools and techniques and go through what can sometimes be a trial-and-error process of learning how to garden, worthwhile yields are never guaranteed.
 
Plus, would-be gardeners are often at the mercy of the seasons, their local environment, and all manner of unforeseen, unpredictable factors that can turn a productive hobby into a laborious chore.
We created boombi in an attempt to simplify the entire growing process by removing the unnecessary and delivering the essential: light, water, and nutrients. 
 
 
 
Once you plug in boombi, you won't have to worry about your plants getting enough water or adequate light, boombi will provide the perfect amounts for your plants automatically.
 
 
So why not just pick up your produce at the local market?
 
Well, the truth is that even your local market might not carry “local” produce. Many of the fruits and vegetables we buy at the store travel thousands of kilometers to get into our shopping carts, only to spoil quickly and wind up in the wastebasket at home.
 
 
 

 
 
Worse still, our current global agricultural system is unsustainable: contributing to pollution, climate change, soil erosion, deforestation, water waste, and labor violations all over the world. 
 
 
 

Source: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/urban-fa...
 
But what if there were an easy, sustainable, and fun way to ease these problems? What if there was a tool that allowed you to grow food in your home with ease? What if you could reduce your food miles (the length travelled from the farm to your table), the amount of water you use, and ultimately the amount of food you waste week after week, month after month, and year after year?
 

 
Boombi isn’t like any other hydroponic home garden. That’s because most other gardening systems aren’t created by gardeners.
 

Groots' vertical farm in Barcelona
 
Groots, the designers of boombi, are first and foremost an urban farm in the heart of Barcelona. Boombi is based on years of experience and innovation that we’ve applied directly to our commercial efforts. We pass that experience and innovation right onto our customers.

 
 
 
At Groots we always put efficiency, sustainability, and social awareness at the forefront of our decision-making process. We believe the path towards a change in agriculture will involve a combination of people growing their own food at home and vertical farming,  which is why by purchasing a boombi you will also contribute to large scale sustainable food production in our vertical farms.
We want everyone to get behind our project and our goal of transforming agriculture, and boombi will be your and our bet for a sustainable future.
 
 
 

 
Boombi is vertical and modular. This means it takes up less space in your home, is highly efficient, and can be cleaned and maintained easily without a PhD in engineering. 
   
 
With boombi you will get a set of preseeded cones ready to start growing. These consist of an organic coconut fiber mix in the shape of a cone with the seeds already inside at the correct depth.
 
 
 
The seeds carry all the necessary nutrients for the plants to sprout, so you will just need to add water and watch your plants grow.
 
Before your first harvest, you will be able to choose the next varieties to grow through the app or the website. We recommend getting the next set of preseeded cones before you harvest so they are ready to place in boombi as soon as you harvest and no time is wasted! 
 
Don’t worry, we will have you covered on the timings.You will be able to choose among a wide variety of tasty, flavorful varieties and will also receive crop recommendations from the farming experts at Groots, so you can grow in parallel with them and receive up-to-date guidance throughout the entire process.
 
With boombi, you can grow a wide variety of edible flowers, greens, herbs, fruits, and even decorative plants. 

 HERBS: Basil, Thai Basil, Lemon Basil, Melisa, Chives, Curly Parsley, Cilantro, Bloody Sorrel, Thyme, Dill, Parsley, Oregano, Mint, Sage & Rosemary.

GREENS: Chard, Spinach, Batavia Lettuce, Romaine Lettuce, Mustard, Pak Choi, Curly Kale, Tuscan Kale & Arugula.

FLOWERS: Nasturtiums & Pansies.

FRUITS: Chili Peppers, Habanero Peppers, mini tomatoes & Garden Strawberries. 

EMPTY CONES: Although our preseeded coconut cones are convenient and easy to use, we have listened to your suggestions and will be offering empty coconut cones so you can use your own seeds and experiment with even more plant varieties. Show us the results on instagram @boombigarden!

 
 
Some countries have restrictions on seed delivery, so we will be shipping empty coconut cones instead and will make sure your plants grow healthy by recommending one of our trusted seed suppliers for each country. 
 


 

 


 
 


 
 
  
 

 
 
 


The boombi lighting system can be easily removed for outdoor growing
   
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 We have used a realistic rendering to show the multiple colors that will be available with boombi


 

 
 

 
 

 
  1. Take your boombi out of the box, it is already assembled for you. Add water to your included pods and allow the seeds to germinate. Check on your pods every few days to see if leaves have appeared.  
 
 
 2. When you see leaves, introduce the pods into the boombi system. 
  
 
 3. Add water and nutrients to your boombi. 
   
 
 4. Plug the system in and let the growing begin. 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Groots was founded in 2018 with the mission of growing local and healthy food in a sustainable and innovative way. Our first breakthrough towards achieving our mission came when we developed our own vertical farming system in a forty square meter garage and began selling produce to local establishments.
 

 
Demand for our fresh produce soon exceeded our ability to produce it. At the same time, several of our customers inquired if we could build custom farming systems for them. This is how our first Boombi—designed for use in hotels and restaurants—was born. After the first successful installation of a Boombi system in a restaurant in Barcelona (OrganiQ), we continued to refine the design of our system. The goal was to get the Boombi into homes around the world.
 

 
In March 2020, we finally cracked the design on a 28-plant system. However, we still wanted to make the Boombi even more accessible and efficient. The result of that design process is Boombi Mini, now available on Indiegogo.
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 


 
 

 
 

 
Over the course of development, our team of co-founders (Joaquim, Alessandro, and Carlos) has expanded to include seven new team members: Gabriela, Juan Carlos, Anas, Hamza, Jorge, Aura and Helena. We are a deeply passionate group of designers, engineers, thinkers, dreamers, and most importantly, gardeners.

Other companies are already actively attempting to improve the world, and we are following their example not only because we believe we can make a meaningful impact through boombi and vertical farming but also to inspire other people (just as we have been inspired by others) to shift their actions towards what they truly believe in.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tom Eddy and I have been involved in solid waste processing for 30 years. Initially I was a Thermal Engineering professor for 20 years at various universities where I taught every thermal Science course on the books and developed a couple in the plasma processing area. This led me into research at the Idaho National Laboratory where I was Principal Engineer and Tech Leader of the Plasma Processing group. Our job became to determine how to process radioactive trash in a safe way into a very stable final waste form - like a basaltic rock. Others before us had developed the rock, but not how to process it continually at high enough temperatures. After about $200 million was spent by various companies  and laboratories in testing, We held an open workshop to discuss the results. The conclusion in 1995 was that a submerged arc furnace (SAF) with graphite electrodes was the optimum way to process both the organic (combustible) and the inorganic (ash) materials.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620749558/xqdmyo0oa4drpepooqxo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Subsequently three other INL engineers and myself (and my wife) started MeltTran, an INL spinoff, to commercialize the process for hazardous as well as non- hazardous solid waste. MeltTran built several SAF units, improving the design each time. Interest came from South Korea to build a prototype to process stored radioactive trash. You saw that unit in the intro video. A second simpler one was built for DARO in S. Korea as a portable display unit in Korea. Unfortunately the Asian recession of 1999 hit and cancelled the sale. The unit became the MeltTran R&amp;D prototype which you also saw in the video.</p>
<p>MeltTran had many clients that wanted a unit that converted (non-radioactive) trash into value-added products that would help pay for the processing. The major issue was that the financing entities were not willing to fund a plant that was large enough to be economically competitive that was not yet up and operating. That issue and the Asian recession led to the MeltTran demise. It was ahead of its time.</p>
<p>Now, 20 years later we are trying to do a restart in order to focus on eliminating landfills as well as simplifying waste management. The restart needs to focus on the people who realize that landfills are contaminating our waterways and polluting our skies. The proposed ultimate solid waste processing machine will process anything, separate the organic materials from the inorganic material, as well as from the metallic material, each of which can then be processed into value-added products. All the input can be processed to the extent there is no waste. That's right - No Waste.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>This time around, we are breaking the project down into steps to bring the people along with us. Step 1 is to request $50,000 to provide the funds to get the campaign going. Step 1 includes:</p>
<p>1. Completion and publishing a detailed handbook of How-to's for operator training as well as for educating waste professionals. The handbook has about 20 chapters on all aspects of design and operation and is already over 50% written.</p>
<p>2. The completion of three (3) more patents that are important to maintain a competitive edge in processing the waste as proposed. Three prior patents are near termination so are open to all. One new patent had just been approved recently.</p>
<p>3. Maintenance of the Eliminate Landfills website which is up and running now and will produce updates for potential investors and others interested.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The proposed project will not only lead to the elimination of landfills, but will simplify waste management. Let the SAF separate the different kinds of waste, not different trash trucks! We have 4 trash trucks going by every Wednesday. That could be 2 or even 1. Recycling is good, but inconvenient. Some items, like aluminum or newspapers, are good to recycle. But plastics are difficult to burn in WTE plants and they do not want inorganic materials which lower the heating value of the waste. Combining MSW with C&amp;D waste and with trees/grass/trimmings is no problem. Let's simplify the waste collection to the waste management companies, increase their margin, and reduce the cost to our communities. A 500 tpd MSW plant will service a population of 300,000 in a city.</p>
<p>The impact extends to coal and other ash landfills which have (or will) cause major contamination of some of our rivers.  These ash landfills can be reclaimed by mining and processing the ash and ground or whatever by the proposes method. The same is true of MSW and C&amp;D landfills, as well as low concentrated coal residue. This can make a large long-term impact on the environment. </p>

<p>The radioactive waste prototype built at the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) by MeltTran and the Korean Heavy Industry &amp; Construction co (KHIC, now Doosan) took 13 months to design, build, install and operate.

<p>As Tech Leader of a Technical Management Team that has developed or is experienced in the SAF plant operation we are trying to help community solid waste managers to reduce their costs and the inconvenience of finding landfills which are a liability. The vendors and equipment for the technology are available and have served industry well.  An Ash plant takes 2 years to design &amp; build, a C&amp;D plant 3 years, and a MSW plant about 4 years, all depending on the size.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are restarting in steps not only to bring people into the project, but because we need to demonstrate the quality of the construction products generated. This will reduce the risk and therefore the cost of funding the WTE Ash processing plant.</p>

<p>Prior work at MeltTran was cut off by the inability to stop the foreclosure on a building for ~$200,000. The bank confiscated $2 million in SAF and other equipment and supplies which they auctioned off for about $75,000. As a result many of the tiles and flagstones were processed, but there was no funding to confirm the materials properties. Many of the tiles were found to be too glassy, brittle and cracked easily. The heat treatment is complicated because one can not reheat up to the necessary temperatures without softening or melting the tiles. Recently, we  developed a method to do that which is one of the 3 proposed patents.  The University R&amp;D will give us time to verify and/or improve the heat treatment procedure. </p>
<p>Basically we have been there and done that, but need some verification of the probable quality.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Tom Eddy and I have been involved in solid waste processing for 30 years. Initially I was a Thermal Engineering professor for 20 years at various universities where I taught every thermal Science course on the books and developed a couple in the plasma processing area. This led me into research at the Idaho National Laboratory where I was Principal Engineer and Tech Leader of the Plasma Processing group. Our job became to determine how to process radioactive trash in a safe way into a very stable final waste form - like a basaltic rock. Others before us had developed the rock, but not how to process it continually at high enough temperatures. After about $200 million was spent by various companies  and laboratories in testing, We held an open workshop to discuss the results. The conclusion in 1995 was that a submerged arc furnace (SAF) with graphite electrodes was the optimum way to process both the organic (combustible) and the inorganic (ash) materials.

Subsequently three other INL engineers and myself (and my wife) started MeltTran, an INL spinoff, to commercialize the process for hazardous as well as non- hazardous solid waste. MeltTran built several SAF units, improving the design each time. Interest came from South Korea to build a prototype to process stored radioactive trash. You saw that unit in the intro video. A second simpler one was built for DARO in S. Korea as a portable display unit in Korea. Unfortunately the Asian recession of 1999 hit and cancelled the sale. The unit became the MeltTran R&D prototype which you also saw in the video.
MeltTran had many clients that wanted a unit that converted (non-radioactive) trash into value-added products that would help pay for the processing. The major issue was that the financing entities were not willing to fund a plant that was large enough to be economically competitive that was not yet up and operating. That issue and the Asian recession led to the MeltTran demise. It was ahead of its time.
Now, 20 years later we are trying to do a restart in order to focus on eliminating landfills as well as simplifying waste management. The restart needs to focus on the people who realize that landfills are contaminating our waterways and polluting our skies. The proposed ultimate solid waste processing machine will process anything, separate the organic materials from the inorganic material, as well as from the metallic material, each of which can then be processed into value-added products. All the input can be processed to the extent there is no waste. That's right - No Waste. Please see our website www.eliminatelandfills.com for additional information. 

 
What We Need & What You Get

This time around, we are breaking the project down into steps to bring the people along with us. Step 1 is to request $50,000 to provide the funds to get the campaign going. Step 1 includes:
1. Completion and publishing a detailed handbook of How-to's for operator training as well as for educating waste professionals. The handbook has about 20 chapters on all aspects of design and operation and is already over 50% written.
2. The completion of three (3) more patents that are important to maintain a competitive edge in processing the waste as proposed. Three prior patents are near termination so are open to all. One new patent had just been approved recently.
3. Maintenance of the Eliminate Landfills website which is up and running now and will produce updates for potential investors and others interested.
4. Materials analysis of some tiles previously made for which funding was not available.
5. And to cover some non-labor administrative costs.
Step 2 will be an equity crowd funding appeal for $1.1 million to build and operate a university R&D 2-ton/day SAF system for R&D, operator training, and future IP development.
Step 3  will be the first commercial/industrial plant to process 150 tons/day of ash from a WTE plant to enhance their profit margin.
Future steps 4&5 will involve a construction & demolition (C&D) waste plant of 250 tpd and a MSW plant of 500 tpd.  Each of these plants has similar inorganic throughput for similarity in design.
Budget Estimates
Most of the funds expect to be expended in the first three months. The latter three months are to account for delays in publishing and patenting, and to extend the web site.  Much, if not most, of the work required is being contributed by the TMT personnel with limited compensation.  Over half of the Handbook is already in first draft stage. The CF goal is $50,000 for Stage 1.

Or power a campsite without the constant hassle of a gas-fueled generator?Gofort takes on the initiative to protect and reserves our natural resources for the next generation. We vision a world of pollution-free and clean.Gofort Solar Power Station is silent and emission-free, and the best option you can use safely inside a house during a blackout, or out in your adventures.  We designed and developed two Gofort versions to ensure we accommodate your needs - Gofort 550 and Gofort 1100Technical numbers can easily go complicated, and sometimes, they are annoying. So we decided to make all numbers easier and straightforward for you. We are excited to share with you that our pilot production has already begun - all we need now is your support and funding to get it to mass production!  When duty calls, you can carry Gofort safely anywhere. Gofort has enough capacity to power your electrical appliances for a long time, and with the portable solar panels, you can add much more charging capabilities and extend runtime. Gofort meets all your charging needs by featuring a wide range of output options - this all-in-one power station is your perfect companion for use at home, parties, camping, and best of all? Your emergency power back-up! While the Gofort has the same capacity as other generators - its peak power is higher than others for up to 2000W, which makes it especially useful for devices that require high rated power. Save the hassle and go versatile with Gofort wherever you need. Don't forget we offer our amazing Gofort Solar Panel for your extra protection. Aesthetics and optimized in functionality. The Gofort has a full-aluminum shell for a flawless appearance and water-resistant for your peace of mind. And for a more comfortable fit and carrying experience, we designed the handle with plastic too!Gofort’s LED light is powerful enough to illuminate a camping site or your home when there’s a power outage. Now you finally get to understand exactly how much power is left, and when you need to charge. Our digital display also tells you the power input and output in real-time! Gofort stands out from the average power station for its variable-frequency technology - the station's frequency (50/60hz) is switchable and Japanese-friendly. Rather than recycling aluminum shell battery, used electric car battery, or lead-acid battery that has only 300 times cycle (not to mention it might be dangerous); instead, Gofort uses 100% high quality and a rigorously tested battery that lasts up to 1000 times cycle. Did you know that there are some devices such as laptops, gaming consoles, refrigerators that are at risk for damage and failure due to unexpected blackouts or power disruptions? Gofort fully integrates and protects your sensitive electronics and equipment during power surges and blackouts with our UPS system. In addition, our Independent charging and discharging circuit modules allow Gofort to charge and recharge simultaneously. Gofort takes good care of your devices and appliances. While other power stations generate unstable outputs (9V-16.8V) that could potentially damage your devices and appliances in charging, Gofort has a regulated DC 12V output that keeps your things charging safely and smoothly. Never again you need to worry about something gets fired up. The Gofort features an Intelligent Temperature Control System which automatically turns the device off once it detects overheating.It also includes a radiator and a silent fan built with heat dissipation materials on the rear which outperforms the average power stations with plastic material typically used in similar devices.Gofort designed and developed our own battery management system (BMS).

Things were going well, when at a certain point I asked myself: </p>
<p>""<strong>WHY ... ?</strong>"" -</p>
<p>And we all know that when it comes to asking this question seriously, <strong>EVERYTHING CHANGES!</strong></p>
<p>... I like Music, IT and especially Physics! I love building innovative things, I also like to try new challenges, elaborate arguments in an original way always starting from assumptions that have been discarded because they are considered Impossible! Because the question I always ask myself is ... And what if over time and with new technologies, we were able to find ways, new experiments, capable of adding a little something to the existing rules? ... For this reason, my favorite quotes are: ""KNOW YOURSELF!"" &amp; ""WE ARE THE CREATORS OF OUR UNIVERSE!"" ...</p>
<p><strong>And with these assumptions, I worked for at least 5 years, all day, every day, to be able to realize what you are seeing! ... and now, if I can ... I'd like to ask you a very little help ... to bring out all my work ... Thanks in advance!</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to advertising this type of propulsion, that is INERTIAL (Non-Newtonian), very complicated experiments are always shown to prove their truthfulness; and the Supporter should be a scientist to always understand everything that is shown! It is for this reason that I wanted to set it up differently! </p>
<p>Simple and effective experiments, but above all the construction of that first prototype, even if very humble, which, as you can see, passes all the tests! And as they say ... to see is to believe! Especially in the water and hung with threads, where friction is very little! In fact, they are usual experiments to pass when it comes to propulsion of this category. Also, since you are giving me your time to read my words, I also decided to include something funny  ... I hope you will appreciate ... But I also hope it does not distract you from the GREAT IMPORTANCE that this Project has.</p>
<p>NON-NEWTONIAN PROPULSION is a branch of research in which the largest organizations at the space level are involved, including: NASA, SPACE X, ESA, etc ... We understand better why they decided to call NON-NEWTONIAN (or REACTIONLESS DRIVE) ... </p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionless_drive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionless_drive</a> </p>

<p>This is the closest thing (THANKS TO NASA) has been written to my Mechanism - but it is built on very different construction grounds, forces involved, the mechanics, etc ... and therefore ... In my small way, I took the liberty of doing it myself ... <strong>I called it STEREO DYNAMIC and you can safely take it as a Science Fiction Booklet </strong>... But remember as you read it, that you have seen the real demonstrations in the videos, and that everything works based on the information written in there! ... I did it using only logical reasoning, to extend the possibility of having as many opinions as possible on your part! And this is the subject of this request for help on IndieGogo! ... <strong>I have to write a Scientific Publication, so I have to pay a specialist who is able to help me with the English Scientific Formal Language ... That's all!</strong></p>
<p><strong>THERE ARE GREAT REWARDS FOR YOUR HELP!</strong></p>

<p>There is also a Patent (Pending) in all this ... A type of Solenoid that makes all this possible ... But here unfortunately we have to go a little more on the Technical ... But let's make it simple! By the laws of Gauss, Maxwell and Dirac, etc ... you will never have the chance to have:</p>
<p><strong>- A DIRECT CURRENT SOLENOID, WHICH SHOWS ONLY ONE POLARITY INSIDE IT!</strong></p>
<p>That is ... Like magnets ... If I feed <strong>ONE SINGLE WINDING</strong> in direct current, it will <strong>ALWAYS</strong> have 2 polarity! And it's all right, this always happens! And we can see it with a block of magnets ... I take a normal solenoid powered in <strong>DC CURRENT</strong>, and I try to pass the magnetic block from one side to the other; ... <strong>AND I WILL NEVER SUCCEED</strong>, 'cause 2 things can happen:</p>

<p><strong>I'M SHOWING YOU ALL THIS, BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE THAT THIS PROPULSION WILL BE MADE BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE! AND WE WILL ALL PLAY! WITHOUT THE NEED OF MULTINATIONALS! ... </strong></p>

<p>Instead, I invite you to see it from another point of view ... Namely ... By studying the movements that are generated inside, and consequently, also on the external system by this type of propulsion, <strong>I HAD TO WRITE A LOGICAL PATH TO IMPROVE ITS OPERATION. I had to use A TON OF ALREADY EXISTING RULES AND PRINCIPLES, AND COMBINE THEM TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING</strong> ... And so it was only the need for <strong>PRACTICALITY</strong>, which prompted me to write this Document called ""Stereo Dynamic"", which simply describes the internal mechanism of this innovative propulsion!</p>
<p><strong>SO WHY DID YOU COMPARE NEWTON'S DYNAMICS?</strong></p>
<p>Because it was the most obvious way to understand the difference in results ... Also, the initial experiments shown in the video are <strong>THE REPRESENTATION of A SINGLE PRINCIPLE</strong> of the Stereo Dynamic ... To create an entire movement, as you see instead in the prototype videos, there are more stuff to say ...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/032/329/503/5487afdd7ec830c62c40e1dab2d73615_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1612989392&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=723007b05d6fdd713bcda45c2bf7bf26"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I can give you an example on how I reasoned to structure the logical process ... We can say that ... in this Sci-Fi Booklet, the Stereo Dynamic is seen as <strong>AN APPENDIX TO CLASSIC DYNAMIC</strong>, which refers only to certain types of bodies, and is a set of ""<strong>2 Sequential Moments</strong>"" between them (also and not only for this reason the name STEREO) and very very different, which can be used to create complete movement ... </p>
<p>Let's say that is managed the NEWTONIAN ""<strong>ACTION</strong>"" First (just like you saw in the videos), and separately, and in a totally different way, the ""<strong>REACTION</strong>""! ... </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Also, to complete this talk, and to help us develop the concept better, WE HAVE THE ELECTROMAGNETISM! ... However, before going into all the details, I would like to make as I said the scientific publication, which is the subject of the loan.</p>

<p>Electronics is an essential component to ensure that all operating principles are respected. It deals with the intensity, frequency and speed of electromagnetic impulses, but not only that ... It also manages Sequence and Simultaneity, capable of composing the real movement ...</p>

<p>If you were not familiar with this type of propulsion, I mention that the movement is developed entirely from inside and this gives us the opportunity to do exceptional things! As you will have seen from the video,<strong> I ALWAYS USE THE SAME OBJECT</strong>:</p>

I'm the guy in the Videos, my name is Marsio Salcuni, I am 35 years old and I am from Foggia. However, I lived half of my life in Rome, to carry out my former primary job which was of Creation and Management of IT structures for Call Centers, and I also had a company, a call center with some partners. Things were going well, when at a certain point I asked myself: 
""WHY ... ?"" -
And we all know that when it comes to asking this question seriously, EVERYTHING CHANGES!
... I like Music, IT and especially Physics! I love building innovative things, I also like to try new challenges, elaborate arguments in an original way always starting from assumptions that have been discarded because they are considered Impossible! Because the question I always ask myself is ... And what if over time and with new technologies, we were able to find ways, new experiments, capable of adding a little something to the existing rules? ... For this reason, my favorite quotes are: ""KNOW YOURSELF!"" & ""WE ARE THE CREATORS OF OUR UNIVERSE!"" ...
And with these assumptions, I worked for at least 5 years, all day, every day, to be able to realize what you are seeing! ... and now, if I can ... I'd like to ask you a very little help ... to bring out all my work ... Thanks in advance!
 
 
 

 
When it comes to advertising this type of propulsion, that is INERTIAL (Non-Newtonian), very complicated experiments are always shown to prove their truthfulness; and the Supporter should be a scientist to always understand everything that is shown! It is for this reason that I wanted to set it up differently! 
Simple and effective experiments, but above all the construction of that first prototype, even if very humble, which, as you can see, passes all the tests! And as they say ... to see is to believe! Especially in the water and hung with threads, where friction is very little! In fact, they are usual experiments to pass when it comes to propulsion of this category. Also, since you are giving me your time to read my words, I also decided to include something funny  ... I hope you will appreciate ... But I also hope it does not distract you from the GREAT IMPORTANCE that this Project has.
NON-NEWTONIAN PROPULSION is a branch of research in which the largest organizations at the space level are involved, including: NASA, SPACE X, ESA, etc ... We understand better why they decided to call NON-NEWTONIAN (or REACTIONLESS DRIVE) ... 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionless_drive 
And to get even closer to the Mechanics of this New Type of Propulsion:
https://physics.fullerton.edu/~jimw/nasa-pap/ 
This is the closest thing (THANKS TO NASA) has been written to my Mechanism - but it is built on very different construction grounds, forces involved, the mechanics, etc ... and therefore ... In my small way, I took the liberty of doing it myself ... I called it STEREO DYNAMIC and you can safely take it as a Science Fiction Booklet ... But remember as you read it, that you have seen the real demonstrations in the videos, and that everything works based on the information written in there! ... I did it using only logical reasoning, to extend the possibility of having as many opinions as possible on your part! And this is the subject of this request for help on IndieGogo! ... I have to write a Scientific Publication, so I have to pay a specialist who is able to help me with the English Scientific Formal Language ... That's all!
THERE ARE GREAT REWARDS FOR YOUR HELP!
 
 
 
 

 
There is also a Patent (Pending) in all this ... A type of Solenoid that makes all this possible ... But here unfortunately we have to go a little more on the Technical ... But let's make it simple! By the laws of Gauss, Maxwell and Dirac, etc ... you will never have the chance to have:
- A DIRECT CURRENT SOLENOID, WHICH SHOWS ONLY ONE POLARITY INSIDE IT!
That is ... Like magnets ... If I feed ONE SINGLE WINDING in direct current, it will ALWAYS have 2 polarity! And it's all right, this always happens! And we can see it with a block of magnets ... I take a normal solenoid powered in DC CURRENT, and I try to pass the magnetic block from one side to the other; ... AND I WILL NEVER SUCCEED, 'cause 2 things can happen:
 

 
PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION:



 
And so, continuing with the question ... 
How to do it, if I wanted to pass this magnetic block from one side to the other? ... 
And here is the Video of ""THE KEYS OF THIS PROPULSION"", which is precisely the Solution of this Enigma ... 
 
PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION:

 
Another proof of what has been said is provided by the Oscilloscope (For those who want to deepen a little!):
 


 
I know, it is a simplified explanation at the most for those who are familiar with the subject, but I want everyone to understand what we are talking about ...
 
- Oscilloscope demonstration - NORMAL SOLENOID:

 
- Oscilloscope demonstration - NEW TYPE OF SOLENOID:

 
I'M SHOWING YOU ALL THIS, BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE THAT THIS PROPULSION WILL BE MADE BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE! AND WE WILL ALL PLAY! WITHOUT THE NEED OF MULTINATIONALS! ... 
And I also know that a work of this kind, to be recognized by official science, needs to be verified through rigorous measurements and must be able to be reproduced by other teams ... And it is precisely for this reason that I turn to you!
 
 
 
 
 


Instead, I invite you to see it from another point of view ... Namely ... By studying the movements that are generated inside, and consequently, also on the external system by this type of propulsion, I HAD TO WRITE A LOGICAL PATH TO IMPROVE ITS OPERATION. I had to use A TON OF ALREADY EXISTING RULES AND PRINCIPLES, AND COMBINE THEM TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING ... And so it was only the need for PRACTICALITY, which prompted me to write this Document called ""Stereo Dynamic"", which simply describes the internal mechanism of this innovative propulsion!
SO WHY DID YOU COMPARE NEWTON'S DYNAMICS?
Because it was the most obvious way to understand the difference in results ... Also, the initial experiments shown in the video are THE REPRESENTATION of A SINGLE PRINCIPLE of the Stereo Dynamic ... To create an entire movement, as you see instead in the prototype videos, there are more stuff to say ...

 
If I can give you an example on how I reasoned to structure the logical process ... We can say that ... in this Sci-Fi Booklet, the Stereo Dynamic is seen as AN APPENDIX TO CLASSIC DYNAMIC, which refers only to certain types of bodies, and is a set of ""2 Sequential Moments"" between them (also and not only for this reason the name STEREO) and very very different, which can be used to create complete movement ... 
Let's say that is managed the NEWTONIAN ""ACTION"" First (just like you saw in the videos), and separately, and in a totally different way, the ""REACTION""! ... 
 

 
Also, to complete this talk, and to help us develop the concept better, WE HAVE THE ELECTROMAGNETISM! ... However, before going into all the details, I would like to make as I said the scientific publication, which is the subject of the loan.
 
 
 
 

 
Electronics is an essential component to ensure that all operating principles are respected. It deals with the intensity, frequency and speed of electromagnetic impulses, but not only that ... It also manages Sequence and Simultaneity, capable of composing the real movement ...
In the following video, a mini summary of the work carried out also on the electronic part ... the development over the time, passing from the idea, to the manual (to study the sequences in detail), to the automatic with and without Arduino ... 
 
WARNING: Funny Intro

 
 
 
 



 
If you were not familiar with this type of propulsion, I mention that the movement is developed entirely from inside and this gives us the opportunity to do exceptional things! As you will have seen from the video, I ALWAYS USE THE SAME OBJECT:
 
 - ON THE WHEELS (NO DRIVE WHEELS - FREE WHEELS)

  - ON THE WATER (NO PROPELLERS) - HUNG WITH WIRES (ALWAYS WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL FORCE) This is the INCREDIBLE RESULT of the fact that we do without friction, to move forward; and that is completely the opposite of how a turbine does to drive a plane, or a propeller to push a boat, or a car engine that pushes the asphalt through the wheels, as opposed to where you want to go ...To make it as clear as possible, with this type of propulsion, you can move any type of object you want; if we mount this motor on the refrigerator, or on the table, or on the bed, you will see them moving in one direction, for no apparent reason, without precisely not needing drive wheels, propellers, or anything else!  ... or in other words, if you hold that prototype yourself in your hands, YOU WILL FEEL PULLED IN A DIRECTION AS BY MAGIC!       A fundamental characteristic of this different ""engine concept"" is that in reality it can be SPLIT as desired along the entire body of the object , without having a central entity like the totality of the existing ones!  Because it is made up of many linked propulsion cylinders to the object to be motorized, in a symmetrical way, which will respond to the same sequence and simultaneity even (to understand) at a kilometer away, to move the same body: - Can Be Mounted on the Frame: - Can Be Mounted on the Body: - And also ... How we love so much: Just because, as I said before, the Propulsion takes place in cylinders (Solenoids to be precise) ... And obviously what better form than this?     As I said previously, considering the movement developed electromagnetically and completely from the inside, this motor will never know where you are, because the external system will not exist for him! It won't need it, unlike any existing propulsion!  In other words:  - IT WILL NOT EMPTY EXHAUST GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND IN OUR LUNGS IF IT WAS APPLIED TO A CAR!!!  - WILL NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE RELEASE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS AGAINST OZONE IF APPLIED TO A PLANE!!! - WILL NOT POLLUTE THE SEA WITH TONS OF PETROLEUM AND TAR IF APPLIED TO A SHIP!!! - AND SO ON, FOR ALL EXISTING VEHICLES!!!!      It is important to underline that the very simple mechanism of this engine does not need gears, transmission shafts, connecting axles or anything else, and therefore reduces wear to historic lows. In addition considering that the propulsion takes place entirely from the inside, even the possible replacements of pieces and cylinders, they can all be made from inside the machine, boat, plane or spaceship, even while traveling, limiting the risks (especially in space) for the astronauts involved!              The choice of Indiegogo, is excellent in several aspects:
Propose to the people to finance a highly technological and innovative project for each individual;
It serves as a huge showcase ... who knows, maybe someone who is doing the same research can take inspiration;
or this page can be viewed by someone who immediately realizes ... what we're really talking about, and the importance of everything I've shown in the videos ... and who wants to fully fund the project;
But above all ... as I have already mentioned above:
  Here is the reason for the amount of the Loan ... I have no big claims ... I like to do things seriously and well! I can still improve the engine ... and a lot! In fact, I have organized the things that I will be able to build if all of you will be kind and far-sighted enough to support this project, UNITED and COMPACT:      I know that funding Research is always difficult, because you have to wait a while to get results! And we don't like to wait! I know ... And after all the cheaters that exist today, we've stopped believing in people! ... But let's do this ... Let's set it up differently! Let's say you HELP TO OPEN A CHANNEL ON YOU-TUBE, where I will periodically publish an episode, in which I will show you all the experiments done thanks to you, and all the steps forward that you have helped me to make! ... AND IN EVERY EPISODE, I WILL GIVE PUBLIC THANKS TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROJECT! ... In this way, I will also be able to show you all the effort that I am putting into it, even hoping to make you laugh a little! (Newton & Galileo, for me, are among the greatest thinkers that ever existed! Obviously, it's just to joke a little!) - SCIENCE IS FUN! SCIENCE IS CREATIVITY!

GCS’ manufacturing operations do not produce any measurable air emissions or toxic or waste discharges.  Furthermore, GCS' mineral fiber products can be manufactured in a fire-retardant form, enabling

mission to restore and conserve our environment by turning harmful coal ash into useful mineral fiber products while generating meaningful jobs throughout our communities of operations.  Since our inception, we have created and patented the technology to do just that.   Whether it’s fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, wet or dry coal ash, GCS’ operations can convert millions of tons of toxic coal ash from any kind of coal each year, into 6 base mineral fibers that can be used to manufacture end-products such as paper, brake pads, textiles, building insulation, rubber, and plastics, and carbon fiber precursors.  All the while, providing as many as 500 direct jobs at each factory and cleaning up the harmful effects of coal ash across the country.   GCS was briefly operational but now has a need to relocate its operations and resume operations within as little as three months from receipt of funding.  To meet our desired outcome, we need your help.  What We Need & What You GetWe seek to raise at least $3.5 million to resume our operations, which would in turn, provide the additional revenue needed to expand our operations and build as many as 100 facilities in the U.S and across the world.For your participation and contribution, you will become a part of GCS' noble journey to rid the world of coal ash and its harmful effects while creating jobs and delivering high quality, sought-after mineral fibers for markets.  Your participation will give you a great sense of fulfillment as you venture with GCS to make the world a better place during our time and our children's to come.  Just imagine driving by a GCS factory in the future or reading an article of commendation about GCS' operations and knowing that you played a major role.  Furthermore, your contribution will earn you tangible rewards that range from company T-shirts to honorary board membership, brand ambassadorship, naming rights for GCS' factories & corporate offices and the actual technology, just to name a few.Should we not be able to meet our goal, we intend to use all funds raised towards our operations and then source the difference through other means.  The ImpactIt is our goal to strengthen the American job market and manufacturing sector by providing quality, reasonably priced, and eco-friendly mineral fiber products to the global market.  All the while, cleaning up our environment through the repurposing of coal ash and reducing public health and energy costs for our fellow citizens.  With each of our factories being able to process as much as 1 million tons of coal ash each year while employing up to 500 people, this translates into a need for 6,000 factories and the creation of 3 million jobs just to address the coal ash currently stored in landfills and ash ponds.  Furthermore, another 100 factories creating as many as 50,000 jobs could be needed annually to process the fresh annual supply of coal ash from just the U.S coal power utilities industry.Within the next 5 years and in addition to the jobs created from our regular mineral fiber manufacturing operations, GCS will expand its global headquarters in the U.S. that would:
Create 250 direct jobs;
Establish 3 regional headquarters throughout the U.S. that would:
Create 150 jobs at each regional headquarters for a combined 450 total direct jobs; and
Create additional 375 direct jobs through GCS’s three (3) regional equipment manufacturing facilities.
In all, one can expect GCS to generate an average of 1,465 total direct jobs each of the next 5 years from the company’s coal ash-to-mineral fiber manufacturing operations, global & regional headquarters operations, and equipment/machine manufacturing operations. In a ten-year outlook, GCS stands to generate an estimated 12,500 direct jobs and 37,500 indirect total jobs.The GCS’  technology is the only one of its kind in the world with respect to its ability to repurpose large volumes of coal ash and possess a flexible energy utilization platform that results in high-grade mineral fibers with a minimal environmental footprint.  The patented technology has the capacity to repurpose up to 1 million metric tons of coal ash (wet ash, dry ash, bottom ash and fly ash) annually per factory into six (6) base mineral fibers at a nearly 1:1 ratio of coal ash to mineral fiber (in terms of weight).  This represents a significant breakthrough in the ability of the utilities industry to realize the beneficial processing of high volumes of coal ash. GCS’ manufacturing operations do not produce any measurable air emissions or toxic or waste discharges.  Furthermore, GCS' mineral fiber products can be manufactured in a fire-retardant form, enabling them to withstand fires and heat up to 2,500 °F (1,372 °C) without losing form or its desirable characteristics Risks & Mitigation PlanWe currently have a factory site in Pennsylvania that is pending the receipt of our manufacturing equipment from Asia in order to resume our manufacturing operations.Given the global pandemic, delays could occur with the receipt of our raw materials from our various suppliers and vendors.  However, we have been working with said suppliers and vendors since the middle of 2020 on mitigations for any potential disruptions and we are confident that any possible delays would be minimal, if there will be any at all.   We also plan to keep on hand, at least a three-month inventory of raw materials at any given time in the event that there are delays across our supply chain system.  With respect to the timely delivery of our future manufacturing equipment by the manufacturers, we plan to order our equipment ahead of time in anticipation of possible delays.We are also taking steps to protect our company from intellectual property infringement by any future competition.  To that end, we have patented our technology in our current markets of operations and intend to expand the breadth of our IP protections further with international patents and the patenting of our actual mineral fibers.Our Founders: Connect with us on: Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Telegram, LinkedIn",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Because moss requires no mowing, no watering, and no fertilizing. Not only does lawncare require a lot of your time and money, but it causes a lot of destruction to the environment. Fertilizing endangers our health and runs off into our local waterways, killing wildlife and causing massive deadzones. Watering lawns and gardens wastes billions of gallons of water each day, and lawn equipment is poorly regulated and contributes substantially to air pollution. Grass lawns also cause a lot of missed opportunity. Moss is incredibly low maintenance, and not only reduces pollution output, but its also extremely effective at controling erosion and filtering air and water pollutants from the environment. </p><p>You don’t have to tear up your whole lawn to be part of the moss movement. There are so many easy and beautiful ways to integrate moss into your landscape, like creating a beautiful rock garden, or creating a moss border to your lawn that controls erosion and keeps our waterways clean. At The Moss Lawn, we have everything you need. We’ve spent years selecting and cultivating moss that shatters expectations. Our solar moss is versatile, lush, and sun tolerant. We’ve also carefully studied and developed the best way to rapidly grow it through our kits, which combine a unique mix that minimizes watering needs and maximizes growth, and moss clusters. For those who want to join the movement but have spacial limitations, we have desktop gardens that are customizable using live moss and plants, and bring the beauty of the outdoors indoors. So join us in making lawncare sustainable and join the moss movement.</p><p><strong>HOW WE DO IT</strong></p><p>We have spent years developing the best method and means to grow a beautiful moss lawn or garden. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567867874/lxbe24cdxjsicuhyfxin.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>There are over 20,000 species worldwide, and our Solar moss is local to only a couple of states in the US. We selected Solar moss based on several criteria- 1. Its height. Our moss averages 2-3” tall - the same height of a perfectly mowed lawn. 2. Its sun tolerance - our moss can both flourish in shade and sun, and can sustain weeks of full sun and heat without dying, it will simply go dormant. 3. Its beauty. Solar moss resembles a carpet of mini trees with 1” wide canopies. It is truly a stunning alternative to grass. 4. Its ability to handle foot traffic. You can walk all over your moss without damaging it. 5. Its fast growth. Solar moss is one of the fastest-growing species of moss, and can go from fragment to a full lawn in about 6 months.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567869671/ip53v5wq9fwqsyaioyso.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Second, we developed the growth practice.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567868634/edaqnvwhigmmn5v8uryt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>While Solar moss can tolerate drought and full sun, the best way to encourage growth is by protecting it from harsh elements. We've tackled moss’s watering needs. While establishing, moss requires frequent light mistings (which is still much less than establishing or established grass). Conserving water is incredibly important to us, so we found the best way to grow moss without using excess water was the introduction of water retention gel to our fragments. We combine micro-Solar fragments and a gel that can hold hundreds of times its weight in water, which it then releases slowly back to the moss. This allows a constant water supply, without constant watering. Time your planting with rainfall, and you can go at least a week without watering. </p><p>We also include comprehensive growing guides with all our kits. We stand by our growth practices, and implement them in all of our expansion.</p><p><strong>Third, we developed the business plan for continued growth.</strong></p><p>Moss cannot be stripped from its environment entirely, as it will hurt the local ecosystem and hurt rapid regrowth. We’ve spent years acquiring and establishing moss on fertile land, and have introduced vertical growth via greenhouses, so that we can grow more moss per square foot of land. We also shuffle moss from full shade to full sun throughout its growth process. </p><p>Not only is our mission and production plan sustainable, but so is our packaging. All of our packaging is made from recycled materials and is biodegradable.

<h3>How the <a href=""http://www.revoltresearch.com/index.php/battery-power-restoration-products/revolt3000-model-pros1-pro-sumer-version/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ReVolt Pro-S1</a> came to be.</h3>
<p>I've been a successful entrepreneur, designing, building, and manufacturing products for over 20 years. And yet, the problems and hassles caused by having to replace dead and weak batteries in my vehicles escaped my attention for most of my life.  Then a few years ago, in my garage and with some spare time, I began working on a solution for myself. About the time I had something that actually, really worked, the crowdsourced funding platforms were hot and I thought I'd take the challenge. After the first device was successfully funded, built and shipped, I went back to my busy life. But the device lived on. More people were asking about buying more units but I had none to ship.</p>
<p>A few years later I changed careers away from the data storage and backup industry and at the urging and help of a friend, thought I would take this to the next level. But I wanted something even better. And I wanted irrefutable proof of the effectiveness of this tool because there are so many failures and misleading products in the marketplace. I set up a retail store called the ReVolt Battery Exchange. The idea was simple. Buy dead batteries, reviving them with the ReVolt machines (like the one being offered here) and then selling those revived batteries for a profit.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559583414/dd4qnx58odf7cf60uzvd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And to make it even more compelling, I knew people really had to have faith in the batteries they bought back from me so I offered an unconditional full money-back guarantee. This way, if the tool and the process didn't produce real results of value, in a world where bad news gets around fast, the business would surely fail.

<p>This is truly a ""GREEN"" product. Here in the US, we are really good at recycling lead. The figures I've seen claims that we recycle 98% of our lead. But that doesn't mean that recycling doesn't have environmental costs. The destructive recycling of automotive batteries produces quite a bit of pollution and produces a lot of toxic emissions. By extending  the useful life of automotive and other batteries, the planet definitely benefits.</p>
<h3><strong>The case of two ""Rescue Batteries"":</strong></h3>
<p>In 2014, when I had the crude but working version, I had been buying dead batteries off Craigslist, fixing them and selling them for a profit in my garage so I could continue to get batteries to keep testing on. During that year, both batteries in my vehicles started to fail. I thought, I want to really put the results of this to the test. So rather than extend the life of the batteries that were failing, I revived them back up and sold them. Then, took two 36 month batteries that were totally dead and even a year or two older. I revived them from the dead and put them in my two vehicles. In June of 2019, those 2010 and 2011 batteries that were completely dead in 2014 are continuing to run my two vehicles in 2019 with the help of a 4-hour ""Boost"" from the ReVolt unit once a year.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560546593/cfshpq3u1mngwfjljay5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have invested in the production of this unit already, but without your help, this will be a much slower process because it will require more production cycles with smaller quantities produced each cycle than if we can establish a larger pool of orders for more units sooner.</p>
<p>An exponential ramp-up is planned, but it's the early cycles that things can really get slowed down in. For example, if we commit to producing 1,000 units the first year, then use the profits from those sales to commit to producing 3,000 the following year, we've only increased production by 2,000 units in the following year.  But if we can commit to producing 2,000 in the first year, it might be possible to go well beyond double that in the following year achieving an increase of 4,000 or more units from only a 1,000 unit increase in the first year.</p>

<p>What's really exciting about this product is that it's so effective at what it does that you can actually create a sustainable and profitable business off of it as we have.  Also, non-destructive battery recycling is far better for the environment and economy than destructive battery recycling.</p>

</div></div>","How the ReVolt Pro-S1 came to be.
I've been a successful entrepreneur, designing, building, and manufacturing products for over 20 years. And yet, the problems and hassles caused by having to replace dead and weak batteries in my vehicles escaped my attention for most of my life.  Then a few years ago, in my garage and with some spare time, I began working on a solution for myself. About the time I had something that actually, really worked, the crowdsourced funding platforms were hot and I thought I'd take the challenge. After the first device was successfully funded, built and shipped, I went back to my busy life. But the device lived on. More people were asking about buying more units but I had none to ship.
A few years later I changed careers away from the data storage and backup industry and at the urging and help of a friend, thought I would take this to the next level. But I wanted something even better. And I wanted irrefutable proof of the effectiveness of this tool because there are so many failures and misleading products in the marketplace. I set up a retail store called the ReVolt Battery Exchange. The idea was simple. Buy dead batteries, reviving them with the ReVolt machines (like the one being offered here) and then selling those revived batteries for a profit.

And to make it even more compelling, I knew people really had to have faith in the batteries they bought back from me so I offered an unconditional full money-back guarantee. This way, if the tool and the process didn't produce real results of value, in a world where bad news gets around fast, the business would surely fail. The business has been and continues to be quite successful today - almost 3 years later! 

In the course of the development of the store, I ran out of parts to build more units, so I emailed all of my past kickstarter and other customers who had purchased the first little consumer unit a few years earlier to see if anyone wished to sell me back their unit at the price they paid for it. Only one person offered it to sell it back because he had never used it. Another teasingly mailed me back saying that I could have it when I pried his ""cold reconditioned hands"" from it.
 

Now others want to open businesses like ours using our exclusive equipment. But I still want this device to be available to people around the world and in a form for field and under-the-hood use, that smaller businesses or individuals can better use.  I want farmers, ranchers, people in remote areas, villagers, people who live on boats, motorhomes, car lots, auto shops, fleet owners, school districts and more to have a tool like we're using in my business today that will recover their dead batteries as well as add many more years of life to their working ones.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Gautam is a farmer in Uttar Pradesh, India, who reached out to us once he heard we had a cold storage solution. Each harvest season, his strawberries rot during unpredictable heat waves. While he keeps them in a shaded area of his house, it’s not enough. To buy a cold storage unit of his own would cost 15 million rupees, prohibitively expensive for a small scale farmer like him.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">India currently has a 90% supply shortage of cold storage facilities. Only 3,000 refrigerated trucks for fruits and vegetables exist to serve the entire nation, most owned by multinational corporations and used to refrigerate processed foods rather than crops from farm to market.</span></p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532561579/dcwo7uocm50ecvuzlg1d.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The issue is three-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Current models rely on renting to farmers, forcing them to shoulder prohibitive cost burdens</li>
<li>Current technologies rely on large refrigeration warehouses, an ineffective solution for small scale farmers -- 92% of all farms in India are small-scale</li>
<li>Current solutions rarely focus on cooling crops from rural farms in transport, instead using expensive and bulky refrigerated trucks to service inter-city routes </li>
</ol>
<p>The Indian government has traditionally banned farmers from selling their crops to unlicensed middlemen. However, recent regulatory changes to Agricultural Produce Market Committee laws this year have legalized outside buyers, making this a unique time of change and potential.</p>
<p>There is a desperate need for a solution, a more accessible, point-to-point cold storage system that can connect the high agricultural potential of rural farms to the incredible need for food across the country and the world.</p>
<p>mPower is that solution. We have designed and are currently iterating a revolutionary prototype of a modular refrigerator to transport produce more cost-efficiently and sustainably, transforming the supply chain of fresh produce in India.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532561618/utgbglknxbhhybxbod4b.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>mPower is affordable, sustainably developed and implemented, and synergizes with governmental regulations and imperatives to ensure long-term outcome achievement and delivery of impact. mPower saves farmers from taking on exponentially increasing costs to store their produce and low prices from cyclic middlemen taking commission while completely mitigating the risks involved with storage and transport. We’re harnessing the power of energy to empower the people of the world, one farm at a time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To start manufacturing the mPower modular cold storage units and establish a logistical presence in India, we need $4000. This step is essential to ensure that mPower penetrates efficiently into our pilot provinces and meets the standards set by the Indian and worldwide energy communities.</p>
<p>We have already completed our first field mission to India, finalizing partners, prototype design, and distribution channels to achieve cultural adequacy and environmental accuracy of the design and distribution. Having worked closely with the communities we intend to serve, we know exactly the iterations of our design and distribution model that we need to implement in India to ensure the maximum achievement of our impact.</p>

<p>Your gift will prove transformational to mPower. Contributing at this stage to mPower will guarantee efficient implementation of the technology and distribution model. All use of gifted money will be clearly documented and will primarily fund expansion of our pre-existing pilot, iterating design, and connecting and empowering the people we hope to serve to together achieve impact at scale.</p>

<h3>The Design</h3>
<p>mPower’s competitive differentiation lies in our combination of technological and logistical distribution solutions. We’ve designed a modular cold storage unit that can store various kind of produce and then transport them without any refrigeration or costly refrigerated trucks for up to 24 hours with only 1 degree Celsius of heat loss. The technology is proven, and nearly identical to current refrigeration technologies: the only differences are in scale, implementation, and effectiveness.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532561689/pejnverkns35tbpsqlst.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Scale: </strong>The design of our hubs consists of one central cooling unit, which works like a traditional refrigerator, connected to and cooling insulated modules attached to the fridge. These modules have a 6150 kg capacity, enough to collect 1 acre of produce from 10 farms. Because they are modular, scaling up only requires increasing the number of insulated modules, rather than adding expensive cooling units.</li>
<li>
<strong>Implementation:</strong> Modularity of these cooling units enables us to transport just the small cubic units from cooling hub to the market using traditional methods of transportation in rural farms: pickup trucks and tractors. This allows us to navigate and deliver produce even in poor infrastructure conditions. mPower’s cooling technology also relies on passive cooling in transport, which acts as an additional line of defense against infrastructure conditions. To passively cool our produce, we wrap the modular units in a heat-reflecting plastic film, which reduces temperature by an additional 10 degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>
<strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Different produce requires different controls for temperature and humidity. By creating modularity, we can uniquely control and optimize for these conditions. All in all, mPower’s modular units can extend the life of produce by up to 2 weeks, uniquely enabling a flexible cold storage distribution system.</li>
</ol>
<p>We think the most empowering aspect of mPower lies in its business model. Instead of forcing farmers to pay for our product, we pay them. Our plan is to purchase produce directly from farmers and take advantage of crop price differences in different locations and different times in the harvest season to generate profit.</p>
<p>We parsed data from state mandi boards (agricultural markets) to find daily crop data. We are currently in the process of developing a predictive algorithm to determine future crop prices, but right now we use this data to create historical models to determine profitable transportation routes. After initial data analysis, we have identified 5 routes. All of these routes yield profit, even when factoring in transportation and maintenance costs. While crop prices are obviously volatile and fluctuate from region to region, these price trends generally hold so that we always receive 1.5-8x price differentials on each route.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>mPower has the potential to transform lives with its advantage over current competitors.  Due to our modular and scalable design, we can set up our storage hub for 20% of the setup cost of traditional refrigerated warehouses, and our operating costs are 30% lower as well.  As a result of these cost savings, we allow farmers to invest in productivity and human development, ultimately improving their socioeconomic status in the long run.</p>
<p>mPower’s technology and distribution model has already been explained and approved by relevant politicians and institutions in India. Unlike other businesses that try to implement without full support and falter out, sometimes doing more harm than good, we first ensured maximum sustainability of our models before implementing, ensuring that our partners are able to trust and believe in us.</p>
<p>Our technology utilizes accessible materials that are sustainable and locally available. This allows for quick-and-easy setup and efficient impact achievement. We strive to reduce the time that our communities wait before they are able to tangibly witness results.</p>
<p>Synergizing agricultural productivity, food security, and income empowerment, mPower offers farmers the complete package to begin the journey to improving the overall quality of life for themselves and their families.</p>

How do we want to achieve our goal? 
The production of fatty acids and their esterification to triglycerides as energy storage is a natural process in all organisms.We make use of this natural way of synthesis by modifying the expression of fatty acids with appropriate carbohydrate chain length on a molecular level. The overall combustion of the triglycerides represents the main characteristics of the product - The Palm Kernel Oil.

We want to change a conventional laboratory strain of the bacteria E.coli to be able to create the desired fatty acid pattern.
We are using the crispr cas9 system to replace an unwanted gene with a set of our chosen genes.

By carrying a short RNA sequence we can guide the system to the matching sequence in the Bacterial DNA. When the target is found the Cas9 protein cuts the strand giving us the opportunity to insert our wantet DNA sequence. 
 
With this method we’re introducing mutations in the tesA gene in order to receive the desired fatty acids lauric acid, myristic acid and oleic acid.

What the current LED Retrofit solutions all have in common are their many uncertainties and complications.What I'm excited to introduce is what I believe will become an unrivaled solution to the LED retrofit market, the Uluxus Link. The very first solid solution for T12 & T8 fixtures. Our system will work instantly regardless of any ballast type and condition. In a matter of two steps, you’ll have successfully converted from fluorescent to LED with 100% reliability and safety. The Uluxus Link comprises of 2 parts, the Leo Links and our UT8 LED Tubes. Here's the installation process:Go Green in a ""Snap""! NO rewiring required. 100% Compatible with all unmodified fixtures & single-end, double-end & non-pin modified fixtures.STEP 1: Simply attach the Leo Links to the ballasts Neutral and Line power wires by snapping them closed. STEP 2: Connect the Link LED Harness, first to the Leo Links, then to the UT8 LEDs.

They are designed only for these wheels and they will not work with any other wheels.</p></div>","If you are like us, you like options. You appreciate your 18 inch Aero wheel covers but would love to have the option to quickly change the look of your Tesla Model 3 without sacrificing efficiency. And it's not just the Aero wheel covers. The 18 inch Aero base alloy wheel has so much going for it too - smooth ride, low risk of pothole tire damage, low risk of curb rash rim damage, all season stock tires, low initial cost, low cost of replacement tires, and efficiency.  There are so many advantages with the 18 inch wheel but just one option in wheel covers. Time to change that. Introducing Orbital wheel covers.   Fits Tesla Model 3 18"" OEM Wheel Part #104422100 and #104426100 (2021 Redesign).Yes, it does fit the new 2021 redesigned wheel.     It literally takes seconds. No trip to the tire shop required.      By almost a full inch.  A larger wheel tends to look better, inspire performance, and somehow pull a trick on your eyes and make the car look sexier. We designed the Orbital wheel covers with size in mind.    A clean look is easy on the eyes. So we kept it clean and eliminated seams and gaps.If you have it, it's okay. We don't judge. Orbital wheel covers extend all the way to the tire hiding any existing curb rash.   With no rim exposed Orbital wheel covers protect against further curb rash damage.     Patent pending five point snap clamps and center lock mounting system ensures you will not lose another wheel cover again.     Combine the highly engineered mounting system with a thermoplastic base material that is fine tuned to have an ideal mix of impact and thermal properties and you get a wheel cover that will stay on in any weather condition and look good for a long time.    We simulated and designed and simulated and tested until we got a similar wh/mi performance to the Aero wheel covers. We tested in beautiful Cleveland weather. We did highway round trip to minimize the wind interference and during night time since there was little to no traffic to interfere. First test was done in the upper 50F and the second in the upper 30F. We also trialed different speeds: 65 mph and a 70 mph. The faster the vehicle travels the more the aerodynamic coefficient of the vehicle will impact the efficiency.   Align, snap in, and install the center cap to lock the wheel cover to the wheel. Done.  They are also easy to remove. Use a suction cup or a flat head screw driver to remove the center cap and unlock the wheel cover. Now you can remove it from the wheel just like you do with the Aero wheel covers.   We engineered them to be made out of one single material that can be easily recycled. No metal clips and springs or any other inclusions present.   A good part of the electricity in our grid still comes from fossil fuel burning power plants. These plants generate large amounts of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases that contribute to the increase of the greenhouse effect. Keep the wheel covers on and the coal in the ground!       The fine print: Tesla logo, Tesla and Model 3 are trademarks of Tesla Inc.

<strong>paprfloor</strong><strong> - the most ecological flooring alternative</strong>
</h2><p>The idea behind paprfloor is quite simple. We looked for an alternative to the normal flooring at fair, that produces a lot of waste and costs. An we found corrugated paper that is normally used for packaging. At the Hannover Fair 2014 we installed that paprfloor for the first time at around 200sqm and it was really surprising, because the floor became more lovely with every day. And so we decided to produce the first charge of the paprfloor.

After many years of being at trade fairs ourselves and looking for an environmentally friendly floor, but not finding one, we decided to develop one ourselves. And paprfloor is the result.</p><h3>

<p>Seduced by the beauty of wind energy. Together with my two sons, we have started Aesthenergy making the Netherlands more beautiful and more sustainable. We are highly motivated to support property and real estate owners in the energy transition by developing and selling beautiful, sustainable energy solutions.</p>
<p>In this initiative, a diverse team of students have created a design of a tiny wind turbine for your property that looks nice and simultanuously generates wind energy. This eye catcher contributes to your aim going energy neutral and off the grid. Combining solar and wind energy provides generating green energy in most wheather conditions, day and night. Together with your help and feedback, we aim at developing ‘snowdrop’ and other nature-like solutions that attracts people. Simultanuously, we aim at creating more and more efficient wind energy solutions and build our knowledge base at universities providing you value for money.</p>
<p>In this campaign, with your contribution, we plan to build a first prototype of the snowdrop wind turbine. This eye catcher might end up on your property! With learnings from the first prototype and feedback from potential customers we further develop beautiful, tiny wind turbines for manufacturing purposes to produce larger quantities of affortable, efficient eye catchers with a high yield.</p>
<p>For building the first prototype, we need funding of about $10,000. On top of this, we need funding for testing the first prototype resulting in a CE certificate. </p>
<p>When you have contributed the highest fund, then we make this eye catcher available for you to place and install it on the perfect spot for you. Your contribution to this crowd funding will be substrated from the total price of this snowdrop wind turbine which we expect to cost $6,000-$9,000 excluding transportation and installation costs.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, more and more attention in the energy transition is paid to solar energy. Unfortunately, more and more citizans express negative perceptions towards wind energy due to the fact that wind turbines need to become larger and larger for increasing yields. This negative perception is slowing down the energy transition. The development of nice-looking, tiny wind turbines is an initiative to turn around these perceptions: wind turbines can be beautiful and efficiencies can be optimised resulting in higher and higher yields (just like PV panels in the last decade). Your support for this important development is highly needed and will help to increase the pace of the energy transition. With your funding and one or more nice-looking, tiny wind turbines on your property, you will demonstrate the importance as well as the enthousiasm for wind energy (which is a valuable energy source for centuries already).</p>
<p>Safety is a key property of wind turbines. When buying building blocks and creating new constructions the safety of the components as well as the total eye catcher should be non-negotiable safe. We plan to spend as much as effort as needed to make sure we bring safe wind turbines on the market. Negative properties for very large wind turbines, such as cumbersome shade and noise, are also double checked for these tiny wind turbines, with the expectations that we eliminate properties, such as shade issues, or transform these in positive ones such as silent wind turbines.</p>
<p>When you like our initiative of developing nice-looking, tiny wind turbines and/or the snowdrop eye catcher, please spread the word, make some noise and share this crowd funding funding request to your friends and relatives using the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

Non-leaking, non-corroding, instantly activated by H20.  PERFECT for emergency situations where powerful batteries are needed for survival.We like to know if there are other ways to use this technology (and how we can work to develop a new product together).  Are you a prepper?  READ ON!Today's AA batteries discharge when left unused for a long time. The internal chemistry changes, and as a result, hydrogen gas is generated. This bloats the battery AND ruptures it at the very tip or the outer metal canister... or worse, both. Harmful chemicals like potassium hydroxide then leak from the battery.  It is a  corrosive material that is highly toxic. This caustic material can cause skin irritation and can also damage your eyes. Inhaling Potassium Hydroxide can irritate the lungs. If you're a first-responder or a prepper, JAW Batteries need to be in your go-bag or disaster shelter! JAW Batteries are inert batteries AND are THE SAFEST AA batteries on the planet!It doesn't corrode EVEN when stored for 20+ years and once activated by water, it's instantly charged to a full 100%. ACTIVATE JAW BATTERIES IN AN EMERGENCY!JAW Batteries stays inert, even for 20+ years, and instantly activates with water. That's why it's the perfect battery for any emergency!Have you ever marveled at the possibility of storing energy forever? And for such energy to be unleashed by something as ubiquitous as water?Keep a number of JAW Batteries at home, office, building, in your cars, boats, or plane... keep it handy, they're ready & vacuum-packed for use, anytime, anywhere! ALL YOU NEED IS WATER! ✅JAW Batteries are unique. They are the only AA (1.5V) batteries in the world that is made with environment-friendly materials to store a charge. This charged material stays inert until it is triggered by water.  In layman terms, we’re putting these batteries to sleep indefinitely and you can easily wake them up with water / any liquid.✅JAW Batteries have been tested in many types of water. We even tested it with tea, milk , soda and even urine!✅JAW Batteries are non-toxic, non-staining and non-leaking.  Absolutely no rare-earth elements used!✅JAW Batteries will come in the following sizes:
AA Batteries (done) 
AAA Batteries (almost ready !)
9V (in final stage of safety testing)
 Whatever emergency situation you're in, power up your emergency equipment with JAW Batteries and significantly increase your chance or survival!   The journey has been long, yet extremely fulfilling. We are amazed at how this became a dream-come-true for the team. Just like any other great idea, it all started with a concept sketch. Even before the devastating natural disasters in 2018, our team at JAW were thinking of ways to change and innovate the portable power landscape.

For example; a standard 250 watt rooftop panel in summer is heated to 110 degrees Centigrade or more, reducing its power output by over half as shown in the following chart. The Solar Sandwich, while heating water to ~40 degrees Centigrade, is also cooling the photovoltaic cells to the same temperature thus increasing the power output by up to 60%.</p>

We are now implementing our material, MY-Foam, into surfboards.MY-Board is the first European MY(celium surf)Board inspired by nature and powered by waste.But why a surfboard?Surfboards are one of the most toxic vehicles in action sports as they are mostly made of plastics.To make a surfboard, the shaper needs a plastic core (e.g. a ""blank""), either from Polyurethane (PU) or from Polystyrene (expanded Polystyrene - EPS -, or extruded Polystyrene - XPS). After shaping the core, the shaper adds layers of reinforcement cloth and binds them together with the plastic core using some resin.Over the years, there have been progresses made to use recycled EPS from the packaging industry, but the surfboard remains plastic based. And when it breaks, thousands of plastic particles end up in the water.What makes MY-Board uniqueTo create a mycelium-grown surfboard, we are partnering with an established and progressive German brand, Riot Surfboards. Riot is creating surfboards with cutting-edge technologies.Together, we are using TrashRE technology, MY-Foam, and Riot expertise to create MY-Board.MY-Board is composed with a MY-Foam blank, reinforced by bio-sourced cloth and S-glass and bound together with bio-based epoxy resin. This is one of our state-of-the-art construction. We are aiming for complete substitution of any non-recyclable raw material.Visit our website to learn more about our work and products.Join the exclusive club of mushroom surfboards riders!Did you know that there are less people who rode a mushroom surfboard than went to space? Pre-order your MY-Board now and become one of these pioneers !You can choose between two designs:My-Board River 5´4This MY-Board combines the speed of a retro fish with the responsiveness of a shortboard.  Ideal for people who like to surf high line, land tricks with ease, without working hard…This board comes standard in mycelium construction with FUTURES fin system and slightly tapered halfmoon.MY-Board Ocean 6´0.This MY-Board is a unique modern performance interpretation of a classic shaped single fin surfboard. It has a reflective soul with the single fin option and turns into a beast with a quad or thruster setup. This board comes standard in mycelium construction with a 4+1 FUTURES + US box fin system and rounded pin tail.Nature-based TechnologyAt TrashRE, we believe that plastic pollution is a material issue. Therefore, we have been working on a material solution to solve it.We have developed an innovative process that turns waste into a sustainable material. We use microorganisms (e.g. mycelium, the ""roots"" of mushrooms) to digest waste and transform it into a foam, a MYcelium Foam (MY-Foam).MY-Foam can replace plastic foams such as polystyrene (commonly known as styropor) or polyurethane. MY-Foam is compostable and eco-friendly.We turn trash into treasure.Experience yourself how mushrooms can help save the worldOur technology, MY-Foam, is based on the digestion of waste by mycelium, the ""roots"" of mushrooms.  We have created for you in exclusivity for Indiegogo easy to use Grow-It-Yourself Kits (GIY kits) that will allow you to try yourselves out to microbiology and experience the power of mushrooms!You will be able to grow yourself objects out of waste tailored to your desire and needs – from holidays decorations to decorative or functional objects, furniture, protective packaging, and more – your only limit is your imagination!We are very excited to have you try our technology!How can you help?You can support us in many ways – you can make a donation or purchase one of our perk or spread the word about our campaign!MY-Board will allow us to demonstrate the efficiency of our technology and to help commercialize a sustainable alternative material to plastic foam. By supporting us, you will help fight plastic pollution and save the oceans - we provide a material solution to a material issue.To achieve our goal, you can make a voluntary donation of your choice or choose from the perks we prepared for you:
You can donate to help us organise trash clean ups in various locations - parcs, forests, streets, beaches...the choice is yours!
You can order some Grow-It-Yourself Kits that will allow you to try out our technology and grow great objects and decorations for your home.
You can pre-order MY-Board today and be the first one to receive this exclusive mycelium-grown surfboard.
Together we can change the world! What comes after MY-Board?We create products with a sustainable material that will not pollute the environment once discarded. We need your help to go to production with our prototype. Our first prototype is a surfboard.The surfboard is only the entry product that will help us prove the competitiveness of our technology. By creating a functional product for the sport industry, we will be able to prove the efficiency of our material. This is a crucial first step towards the transformation of the industries.Indeed, our technology goes beyond being only a material: it will require the reinventing of production lines and supply chain to enhance waste and reuse it as raw material. Our technology does not produce CO2 in its manufacturing process. It uses natural organisms to remediate harmful waste and turn it into a harmless material that is compostable. We leverage natural processes to produce goods.This will be the main change triggered by such a campaign – consumers will tell industrials which kind of product they want to purchase, but, especially HOW they want their products to be produced.With this project, we will be triggering the advent of the Fifth Industrial Revolution: an era that will be dedicated to sustainable technologies at all levels, where everything will be reused, and nothing wasted.By supporting us, you will not only contribute to the creation of ethical products, but you will also accelerate the adoption of a new sustainable material while sending a message to big corporation: change comes from the bottom up, not top down.Let’s unlock the power of mushrooms and create the industry of the future today!TimelineDesign and prototyping are in progress.

Part of the Qosqomposta Team in Qoricancha (Temple of the Sun) in Cusco, Peru.</p><p>Cusco’s waste management is in crisis. Our local landfill is about to reach its maximum capacity by next year. Projects for future landfill locations are already causing social conflicts, given that any new location will have a huge negative impact on the soil, water, and quality of life in the surrounding Andean communities. Such communities are not only far from the city, making them ideal for landfills, but also, they are lacking critical infrastructure. Beyond the technical flaws in waste management, the city’s population is increasing at a dramatic rate. The population was estimated at 434,654 as of 2015, which is 300% more than in 2005 (107,840) according to the Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI).

Her expertise in climate change and interest to achieve sustainable living, pushed her to get involved in the promotion of the Sustainable Development Goals proposed by the United Nations.  We acknowledge the huge responsibility of running a company for processing organic waste, given that very few companies have tried it until now. However, we believe that the new reality created by the COVID-19 pandemic has awakened an interest in people to pursue a better and more sustainable lifestyle.</p><p>Over 10 years ago, we went knocking door to door, trying to get people involved in recycling. Even though this is still a work in progress, we believe that social media has improved the way information gets to people. Facebook and Instagram will be our major sources for marketing, as well as the “Qondor Qomposters” bike and trailer that will pick up “all that nobody wants to eat” as the Andean condor does in nature. In addition to facilitating the decomposition of organic matter, the condor has an important cultural meaning in Andean mythology, with close association to the sun deity as the ruler of the upper world. This bird is considered a symbol of power and health in many Andean cultures.</p><p>We believe we are prepared for the challenges of this project and got the innovation and creativity required to move it forward!</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Please share this campaign with family and friends.

We cannot only say that we care about nature, but we study natural systems. Consuelo, our founder, went to the US to obtain her Master of Science, where she studied the implications of climate change in the community of snakes in South America. Her expertise in climate change and interest to achieve sustainable living, pushed her to get involved in the promotion of the Sustainable Development Goals proposed by the United Nations.  We acknowledge the huge responsibility of running a company for processing organic waste, given that very few companies have tried it until now. However, we believe that the new reality created by the COVID-19 pandemic has awakened an interest in people to pursue a better and more sustainable lifestyle.Over 10 years ago, we went knocking door to door, trying to get people involved in recycling. Even though this is still a work in progress, we believe that social media has improved the way information gets to people. Facebook and Instagram will be our major sources for marketing, as well as the “Qondor Qomposters” bike and trailer that will pick up “all that nobody wants to eat” as the Andean condor does in nature. In addition to facilitating the decomposition of organic matter, the condor has an important cultural meaning in Andean mythology, with close association to the sun deity as the ruler of the upper world. This bird is considered a symbol of power and health in many Andean cultures.We believe we are prepared for the challenges of this project and got the innovation and creativity required to move it forward!Other Ways You Can HelpPlease share this campaign with family and friends. We are sure this idea is replicable in many other parts of the world. Together we can stop food waste, improve our soils, and fight climate change!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Why Oonnati</h2>
<p>In India, 9 million pumps used for irrigation are diesel-powered, costing farmers <a href=""http://www.greengrowthknowledge.org/sites/default/files/downloads/best-practices/GGGI%20Case%20Study_Solar-Powered%20Irrigation%20Pumps%20in%20India_June%202017.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">$4 billion per year</a>. These pumps are a huge financial burden on farmers, most of whom cannot afford to invest in alternatives. Diesel pumps are also highly polluting, accounting for a staggering <a href=""https://medium.com/energy-access-india/how-distributed-solar-can-save-india-10-billion-elimate-5-of-national-emissions-and-increase-41abe8996b7d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5% of India’s carbon emissions</a>. Lack of affordable irrigation solutions has led to an irrigation crisis, keeping agricultural yields low, limiting farmers' meagre incomes, and trapping them in a cycle of poverty. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556770113/arfhiplk7jszdvgtq3iz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<p>Solar pumps are a cost-effective and sustainable solution, but 90% of farmers - mostly poor and marginal farmers with less than 1 hectare of landholding - cannot afford the upfront investment. </p>
<p>Oonnati, which means ""progress"" in Hindi, is a disruptive solution to make affordable low-carbon solar pumping technology accessible to these farmers. We install, operate and maintain Community Solar Pumps that can be shared by a group of 15-30 farmers with adjacent landholding. Any farmer with land near to a solar pump can sign up to Oonnati irrigation services and access water year-round without any upfront cost. Farmers buy water on a pay-as-you-go basis at a tariff that is 20% cheaper than diesel-powered irrigation. They <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">can more effectively irrigate their land, increase crop yields by up to 50% and diversify to grow high-value crops - thus <a href=""https://shaktifoundation.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SolarPumps_Assessment-in-four-states.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">potentially doubling their incomes</a>. </span></p>
<p>In addition to providing water services, Oorja also operates and maintains the solar pumps for their full lifetime, ensuring sustainability. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Plan</h2>
<div>
<p>Oorja is running this campaign to launch Oonnati in Assam, India, where only 20% of farmland is under irrigation, with the remainder being rainfed. Almost 70% of the population of Assam is directly dependent on agriculture as a source of income. Farmers grow mostly rice, wheat, oilseeds, pulses and some vegetables and fruits. There is <a href=""http://kvkbongaigaon.nic.in/District_Inventory.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">potential for high agricultural yields</a>, but this is constrained by erratic and uncertain rainfall.</p>
<p>With your contribution, we will install six Community Solar Pumps in Bongaigaon district, Assam, helping irrigate approximately 120 acres of farmland. This project will meet the irrigation water needs of a community of about 1,000 people. It will reduce their irrigation expenses by over 20%, prevent 5,000 litres of diesel from being burned annually and save 13,400 kg of CO2 from being emitted each year. We will also create 4 full-time jobs in the  community. </p>
<div><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556178105/qxpj627gitlwchx3ps19.jpg"" src=""""/></h3></div>
<p>We have partnered with <a href=""http://www.sesta.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Seven Sisters Development Assistance</a> (SeSTA), a local NGO that has been active in livelihood promotion in Assam for the past eight years. They will assist us with community mobilisation and formation of farmer groups. SeSTA will also train farmers on effective irrigation and cultivation of high-value crops to help maximise the benefits farmers receive from solar pumping.</p>
<p>This project is a critical milestone in our mission to build inclusive, prosperous and climate-resilient rural economies. It is important because it will help us demonstrate the viability of Oonnati in a new market, gain traction among farmers, and scale up to deploy 1000s of solar pumps. In contributing to this campaign, you will not just be supporting a project. You will be helping us build a movement so that we can replicate this model all over India and Africa to impact millions of farmers.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>Your donations will be used for the deployment of one Cluster of six Community Solar Pumps (each 3 HP in capacity) in Assam. We require £25,000 to cover the costs of solar pumping equipment, borewell construction, labour and material for installation and travel to Bongaigaon district, Assam for site selection, project implementation and training. With support from SeSTA, we have already collected preliminary data on local groundwater levels and cropping patterns and obtained buy-in from the farming community. Once we receive the funds, we will be ready to proceed with procuring equipment and implementing the project so we can start Oonnati irrigation services this summer. The costs of operating and maintaining the pump Cluster (technician and operator salaries, spare parts, repairs, etc.) will be covered by the water fees collected from farmers.</p>

</div>
<p>In case we only partially meet our funding goal, we will install a reduced number of solar pumps on a pro rata basis after covering our essential costs (£3,500 for travel and overheads). On the other hand, if we exceed our funding goal, we have several more feasible sites in the pipeline, where we can implement additional Clusters. In short, more funds equal more pumps deployed and more farmers impacted!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This solar powering unit is a time switching battery powered solar charged circuit, used to power an Arduino Uno and some peripherals. The solar powering unit presented here is energy efficient. When we talk about Arduino, it consumes lots of energy in displays and other work that are not important. The solar powering unit presented here has a timer which turns on the Arduino in regular intervals. When you have a project like weather station, remote data logger, etc. or applications like this, you do not have to keep your Arduino on all the time. And of course in all this applications, powering is the major issue. If you turn on the Arduino in 1 minute or any interval, it can save a lot energy. This unit is variable i.e. you can decide the time delay! The unit can also power your Arduino when there is no sunlight(at night) as it has a rechargeable battery inside.</p>
<p><u><strong>It's not just a solar powering unit and not just a timer. It's a combination of both of them!</strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524035331/zfvdviqxpycgx6invvbt.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></u></p>
<p> </p>

<li>Can also work without sunlight!</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Switch for using power from batteries</li>
<li>Highly compatible with Arduino and its peripherals</li>
<li>Long battery life</li>
<li>Detachable solar panel</li>

<p>The unit actually contains a timer which is variable and the time delay can be adjusted by Potentiometer. The maximum time delay you can set is 5 minutes. The minimum time delay is 30 seconds. If there is no proper sunlight, a switch is provided to run your Arduino on Batteries! The port for this is different.</p>

<h3>Night mode:</h3>
<p>In night mode, the unit powers your device in absence of sunlight. Based on the applications, there are two types of unit:</p>
<p><strong>1. With timer in night mode:</strong></p>
<p>It is ideal for applications like weather station, data loggers, leakage detection, etc.</p>
<p><strong>2. Without timer in night mode:</strong></p>
<p>It is ideal for applications like theft detection where probability of theft is high at night.</p>

This solar powering unit is a time switching battery powered solar charged circuit, used to power an Arduino Uno and some peripherals. The solar powering unit presented here is energy efficient. When we talk about Arduino, it consumes lots of energy in displays and other work that are not important. The solar powering unit presented here has a timer which turns on the Arduino in regular intervals. When you have a project like weather station, remote data logger, etc. or applications like this, you do not have to keep your Arduino on all the time. And of course in all this applications, powering is the major issue. If you turn on the Arduino in 1 minute or any interval, it can save a lot energy. This unit is variable i.e. you can decide the time delay! The unit can also power your Arduino when there is no sunlight(at night) as it has a rechargeable battery inside.
It's not just a solar powering unit and not just a timer. It's a combination of both of them!

 
Features:

Time switching device 
Variable i.e. you can change the time delay
Can also work without sunlight!
Easy to use
Switch for using power from batteries
Highly compatible with Arduino and its peripherals
Long battery life
Detachable solar panel
Less charging time
Portable
Clean energy



The unit actually contains a timer which is variable and the time delay can be adjusted by Potentiometer. The maximum time delay you can set is 5 minutes. The minimum time delay is 30 seconds. If there is no proper sunlight, a switch is provided to run your Arduino on Batteries! The port for this is different.


Night mode:
In night mode, the unit powers your device in absence of sunlight. Based on the applications, there are two types of unit:
1. With timer in night mode:
It is ideal for applications like weather station, data loggers, leakage detection, etc.
2. Without timer in night mode:
It is ideal for applications like theft detection where probability of theft is high at night.

Applications:
Weather Stations

This unit can be used to power weather monitors. Here it is not necessary to keep the sensors working 24/7. They can be made working using specific time delay which can save a lot power. 
Data logggers

The unit can also be used to power data loggers. They can collect data at specific time delays saving energy.
Powering copper pipe theft alarm

Copper pipe theft is increasing day by day increasing demand of copper. For prevention of this, copper pipe theft alarms are placed in industries.
""There's no question the theft has gotten much, much worse,"" said Mike Adelizzi, president of the American Supply Association, a nonprofit group representing distributors and suppliers in the plumbing, heating, cooling and industrial pipe industries.
This unit can be used to power the alarm system. In daytime we can use timer mode as the chances are lower for theft at daytime. For night time, special switch is placed in unit which keeps Arduino awake all the time. Thus, saving energy at daytime and using it at night.
Leakage detection

The unit can be used to power leakage detector circuit. This will check the leakage every specific time interval thus, saving energy.
In industries:

The timers are necessary to time the tasking and production which then enables to calculate costs and other elements.
But here, it's not just a timer it is power saving timer which powers your equipment.
Rates:

The unit is available in just 9.5$. 
1 unit = 9.5 USD
2 units = 19 USD
4 units = 36 USD
8 units: 72 USD
10 units: 89 USD
 
Battery Life Calculation:
Arduino ON time: 1 seconds
Arduino OFF time: 1 min. = 60 seconds
Power(when ON) = 1/3600 x 3mA = 0.0042 mWh
Power(when OFF)= 1/60 x 0.2mA = 0.167mWh
Operating Voltage: 5V
Power(ON+OFF): 0.17mWh
Li-Ion Battery: 2100mAh
Battery Voltage: 2.4V
Power: 2100 x 2.4 = 5040mWh
Battery Life: 5040/0.17 = 30k cycles
Note: Power consumed by power booster is not calculated here.
Thus, timer circuit saves a lot energy and also saves energy by cutting power of sensors, displays, etc. In sleep mode, the power consumed by ATMEL micro controller will reduce.
Without timer mode:

<h3>Our Founders Story</h3>
<p>Growing up in Texas in the 1960s and 70s Mark Poullos was surrounded by friends and family members in the aviation and oilfield industries. </p>
<p>Mark’s father Milton was a researcher, who constantly introduced him to the latest and greatest in material science. This led Mark down the path to become an engineer. In 1984, while working on an off-shore oil platform Mark realized the potential to use laser powder coatings technology to solve the challenge of quickly corroding metals with plastics in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Over 30 years later, Mark and his team of master laser engineers have created a one-of-a-kind patented laser technology that revolutionizes the way that both hobbyists and industrial companies add paint coatings to almost any object. We now debut the first at-home colorizing system, the Colorizer™.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Upload your artwork to your PC</li>
<li>Step 2: Use the software to choose the colors in your image</li>
<li>Step 3: Add color powder to your object</li>
<li>Step 4: Run object through the Colorizer™. Repeat Step 3 and 4 for each color layer</li>
<li>Step 5: Cure object in oven to permanently affix your image</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Our Founders Story
Growing up in Texas in the 1960s and 70s Mark Poullos was surrounded by friends and family members in the aviation and oilfield industries. 
Mark’s father Milton was a researcher, who constantly introduced him to the latest and greatest in material science. This led Mark down the path to become an engineer. In 1984, while working on an off-shore oil platform Mark realized the potential to use laser powder coatings technology to solve the challenge of quickly corroding metals with plastics in harsh conditions.
Over 30 years later, Mark and his team of master laser engineers have created a one-of-a-kind patented laser technology that revolutionizes the way that both hobbyists and industrial companies add paint coatings to almost any object. We now debut the first at-home colorizing system, the Colorizer™.
 
How it works

Step 1: Upload your artwork to your PC
Step 2: Use the software to choose the colors in your image
Step 3: Add color powder to your object
Step 4: Run object through the Colorizer™. Repeat Step 3 and 4 for each color layer
Step 5: Cure object in oven to permanently affix your image


Benefits vs traditional painting and printing

No messy paints, brushes or cleanup solvents
No paint fumes
Highly durable finish 
No toxic paint or hazardous chemicals
Use on different surfaces
High speed and low cost
Custom imaging from home

<p>EPO-90 is a liquid-powered emergency power supply for USB devices that can operate independently of the weather and time of day and provide enough power to handle a potential emergency. If you fill the epo with liquids and connect with your cellphone, you can extend the phone's operating time, you will be able to call for help, you can be found for hours, and you don't have to wait to get help, or not.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550071747/xrl66hkqtsgv1soc3sbc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The EPO-90 can be used up to 100+ times with the exact instructions in its manual. It is primarily designed for emergency use. All EPO-90 is dry-ionized with minerals, which guarantees safe operation (without any additional ions) for the first 1-2 times. For any further use, natural mineral salts may be required. In the case of operation with natural or ionized liquid, it is not necessary to add any additives, as it has a natural amount of dissolved minerals.</p>
<p><br/>- All types of USB devices can be used for emergency operation and safety charging.<br/>- Even in the most extreme conditions, it is fool-proof.<br/>- It can be stored for up to 25 years in dry (standby) state, so it is always ready for<br/>immediate operation during this period.</p>

An unexpected situation can happen anywhere, anytime, anywhere. For example road accidents, situations caused by storms, sea or water accidents, power outages, avalanches, etc. <strong>Be prepeared to have a good chance handle such emergency situations!</strong></p>
<p>The mobile phone is already there for everyone, we can use it in an emergency, but if it is discharged we can't get help. We can get lost in the woods, we can't use it as a light source. There are two types of emergency: unexpected and predictable.</p>

<p><strong>The EPO-90 helps you manage the situation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Managing an emergency consists of three important elements:</strong><br/>1. Ensuring Communication - Independently from the weather conditions EPO helps you to charge instantly your mobile, radio or walkie-talkie in case a low, or empty battery so you can call for help<br/>2. Positioning - The power consumption of devices with a large display, or apps with detailed graphics is very high. With our emergency power unit you can charge your GPS, or phone to specify your exact position and help the rescue team to find you.<br/>3. Visibility - To use your mobile device’s flashlight for a longer time has a very high power consumption. If you need to make yourself visible, or need to make light in a dark environment you can use EPO to charge your device and extend the working time of your device for hours. With an extension part you are able to make light with your EPO.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","EPO-90 is a liquid-powered emergency power supply for USB devices that can operate independently of the weather and time of day and provide enough power to handle a potential emergency. If you fill the epo with liquids and connect with your cellphone, you can extend the phone's operating time, you will be able to call for help, you can be found for hours, and you don't have to wait to get help, or not.


The EPO-90 can be used up to 100+ times with the exact instructions in its manual. It is primarily designed for emergency use. All EPO-90 is dry-ionized with minerals, which guarantees safe operation (without any additional ions) for the first 1-2 times. For any further use, natural mineral salts may be required. In the case of operation with natural or ionized liquid, it is not necessary to add any additives, as it has a natural amount of dissolved minerals.
- All types of USB devices can be used for emergency operation and safety charging.- Even in the most extreme conditions, it is fool-proof.- It can be stored for up to 25 years in dry (standby) state, so it is always ready forimmediate operation during this period.


For someone to get into an emergency, you don't have to climb, fly, or go to sea. An unexpected situation can happen anywhere, anytime, anywhere. For example road accidents, situations caused by storms, sea or water accidents, power outages, avalanches, etc. Be prepeared to have a good chance handle such emergency situations!
The mobile phone is already there for everyone, we can use it in an emergency, but if it is discharged we can't get help. We can get lost in the woods, we can't use it as a light source. There are two types of emergency: unexpected and predictable.

The EPO-90 helps you manage the situation. 
Managing an emergency consists of three important elements:1. Ensuring Communication - Independently from the weather conditions EPO helps you to charge instantly your mobile, radio or walkie-talkie in case a low, or empty battery so you can call for help2. Positioning - The power consumption of devices with a large display, or apps with detailed graphics is very high. With our emergency power unit you can charge your GPS, or phone to specify your exact position and help the rescue team to find you.3. Visibility - To use your mobile device’s flashlight for a longer time has a very high power consumption. If you need to make yourself visible, or need to make light in a dark environment you can use EPO to charge your device and extend the working time of your device for hours. With an extension part you are able to make light with your EPO.

The spirit of the EPO-90 is the energy cell based on SWES Technology, which is specially designed for producing energy from ionized liquid and completed with custom control electronics. This is a galvanic system that when immersed in liquid, produces the necessary energy by electro-chemistry.

EPO-90 has been developed to be able to operate (with the exception of acids and alkalis) with any oil and fat-free liquid. All EPO-90 are dry-ionized, guaranteeing immediate operation with any liquid.

The EPO-90 is suitable for direct operation or charging of any device with an A-type USB connector.

For example, for charging mobile phones, tablets or even battery banks, as well as for direct operation and operation of USB lights, E-books, fans, GPS and Walkie-Talkies, smart watches, photo cameras. So it can be used with any electrical device that has a USB power connector.
 

 

If it is used in accordance with the regulations, it can be used up to 100x, otherwise it can work for 25 years, so you can get ready for an emergency, for natural disasters and you should order now, because they are getting cheaper during the campaign. 

We provide standby warranty for EPO-90 is 25 years and 1 year standard guarantee. The standby warranty is valid till the first usage of the product. The guarantee doesn’t cover any freight or shipping charges.Please note that a repair issue will NOT be covered by this warranty if:
