<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In an act of dedication to our art, 30 actors have come together at the University of Northern Illinois to study under the tutelage of Master teachers such as Kathryn Gately, Richard Poole, Deborah Robertson, Stanton Davis, Patricia Skarbinski and Alex Gelman. Techniques from Sanford Meisner, Catherine Fitzmaurice, Michael Chekhov, Stanislavsky and Loyd<span> Williamson</span> have been lovingly and carefully drawn from to harness each actor’s individual talents. The result? 30 Artists were born. Now, as graduation approaches and the real world awaits, we artists desire integration into the professional film and theatrical worlds. We desire to become an integral part of this country's artistic community and we need your help. Support the actors at NIU as they strive to bring their artistry to a larger audience. Help them propel their careers and honor the lineage of their training. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Breaking It Down</h3>
<p>Our goal now is to infiltrate the artistic communities with the great theatrical lineage that has been generously passed down to us. We feel a duty to continue creating and inspiring. We each have a distinct artistic voice, and we hope to let those voices be heard. What we need HELP with is our integration into the professional artistic communities. That is the purpose of our <strong>Showcase Reels.</strong> We need tools by which to open the sometimes-exclusive gates of the professional theater and film industries. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Cost</h3>
<p>The cost of filming two scenes each for 30 actors is $18,000. Our group is in a fundraising frenzy and hopes to earn 1/3 of the money through Holiday shows, Cabarets, Bake sales, Trivia Nights, etc. (to stay up on these events visit our facebook page <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/NIUactors2013"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/NIUactors2013</a>) but we need your support to make our final goal. </p>

The Backstory: Rain and Sarah have been making art together since 2007. Rain fell in love with an American who cannot move abroad and Sarah fell in love with a Brit who cannot move abroad. The conundrum is two artists separated by an ocean, committed to working with each other, but without sacrificing love to do so.
 
Although we live on opposite sides of the Atlantic our wish to create art together remains alive and vibrant.  Your contribution will pay for three trips across the atlantic in order for us to choreograph, design, create and perform together our pieces Unhinged and Unchained
 
This past January, Sarah flew west to join Rain in Atlanta for a three week development period. During this time we built the apparatus, designed and fabricated our costumes, began the choreography and shot the demo for our latest artisitic endevor, Unchained.  However,  the piece is unfinished. We would like to continue developing this piece by having Rain fly to Scotland.  Our goal is to show Unchained in front of an audience for the first time in 2013. 
 
We will also be expanding one of our existing aerial pieces,Unhinged.We will be working with a photographer / graphic designer to create a live narrative photo essay which will be projected with slide projectors and integrated with our movement on aerial silks.  We will be presenting this piece at the Manipulate Festival in Scotland on February 6th at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Inspired by the work of New York City-based photographer Sol Aramendi and “The Art of Toreo” or bullfighting, Ramos created <em>EN LA ARENA NO TODO ES ROSADO/IN THE ARENA NOT EVERYTHING IS PINK</em>.  <br/><br/> In this new work, Ramos explores themes of sexuality and the disappointments of queer dating after the sudden end of a 13-year relationship. The work shows the everyday struggles of new beginnings. Bullfighting, with its paradox of beauty and cruelty, pits the Toreo (bullfighter) against the brave but suffering bull. Like this provocation, the work shows how we fight for survival in a similar battle to the death. This struggle motivates the emotional and physical content of the work.</p>
<p>This is being presented by The Young Roots Performance Series at Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture. Funded by the Rockefeller Foudnation NYC Cultural Innovation Fund 2010-12, this series showcases emerging artists experimenting with the artistic roots of Afro-Latino traditions to create new branches that reach into the future. <a href=""http://theyoungrootsperformanceseries.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">theyoungrootsperformanceseries.blogspot.com</a>.</p>
<p>The work was developed as part of a Studio Series residency at New York Live Arts, as well as an ongoing residency at El Museo del Barrio. Ramos deeply identified with two works by Aramendi on display at El Museo del Barrio’s <em>The (S) Files 2011</em> exhibition. Aramendi's photographs, ""Bailando Conmigo"" (""Dancing with myself""), shows a woman ironing records by hand as they melt under her touch. Another work, “El Amor Duele” (""Love Hurts""), depicts a bride who hangs her heart on a coat rack. These works motivated Ramos to examine real life, quotidian events such as eating, having sex, or taking pills in a surreal way.</p>
<p>Endless thanks are due to Jane Gabriels and Pepatian for the never-ending support, and for making every part of the process a reality.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $5000 to pay our build a set, light the piece, finish the costumes, and of course pay the dancers. In exchange, aside from our excellent rewards, you will be supporting one of the few queer Puerto Rican voices currently coming to prominence in the contemporary dance world of New York City. You will also be supporting a truly amazing work of art.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Antonio's work has been presented by some of the most important dance venues in New York City (DTW, New York Live Arts, and The Kitchen, to name a few), and it has been extremely well-received. Still, with all of that wonderful support, <em>he has never had an evening-length solo show</em>. If this project is a success, it will absolutely start a new and necessary chapter for Antonio and his choreographic career.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Many people do not have the funds to contribute, and of course we totally understand! You can definitely still support us.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Come to the show!</strong> We need people to show up and let the Bronx see that we want contemporary dance to live and grow in Bronx venues. Come alone, or better yet bring a ton of friends! November 29 and 30 at Hostos College at 149th and Grand Concourse. Seriously, it's faster than getting from North to South Brooklyn friends!</p>
<p>2) Maybe you don't have money, but you know someone who would be thrilled to support this work and has some cash to spare. Send them the link, put them in touch with us, and/or bring them to the show.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Written by Samantha Macher, author of last year's critically acclaimed and sold out SkyPilot production, <strong>TO THE NEW GIRL.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Directed by Nancy Dobbs Owen</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Starring Julia Sanford, Brett Fleisher, Sachiyo K, Jeffrey Markle, Kelly Goodman, Katie Apicella, Amelia Rose, Ethan Zachary Scott, Alicia Foo, Yukari Koseki, Reesa Ishiyama</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is the fall of 1945. Private Alvin Rhodes is returning home to his mother Catherine in Merced, CA. He has an injury that he doesn’t want to discuss and a new wife, a Japanese nurse named Yumi. Yumi is greeted with suspicion and fear, even outright hatred. The bombs were dropped only two months prior and Japanese Americans are still unjustly interned at Manzinar, not far away. She is shy and withdrawn, but with the help of Catherine’s old friend Richard, a Japanese/English dictionary and 1000 paper cranes, her story is slowly revealed. <strong>WAR BRIDE</strong>combines sharp, witty dialogue with Japanese Butoh influenced contemporary dance to create a completely new play that will tear at your heart while challenging your ideas of right and wrong.</p>

<h3> </h3></div>","Controversy erupts in a small California town in 1945 when a local hero returns from World War II with his Japanese bride.
 
Written by Samantha Macher, author of last year's critically acclaimed and sold out SkyPilot production, TO THE NEW GIRL.
 
Directed by Nancy Dobbs Owen
 
Starring Julia Sanford, Brett Fleisher, Sachiyo K, Jeffrey Markle, Kelly Goodman, Katie Apicella, Amelia Rose, Ethan Zachary Scott, Alicia Foo, Yukari Koseki, Reesa Ishiyama
 
It is the fall of 1945. Private Alvin Rhodes is returning home to his mother Catherine in Merced, CA. He has an injury that he doesn’t want to discuss and a new wife, a Japanese nurse named Yumi. Yumi is greeted with suspicion and fear, even outright hatred. The bombs were dropped only two months prior and Japanese Americans are still unjustly interned at Manzinar, not far away. She is shy and withdrawn, but with the help of Catherine’s old friend Richard, a Japanese/English dictionary and 1000 paper cranes, her story is slowly revealed. WAR BRIDEcombines sharp, witty dialogue with Japanese Butoh influenced contemporary dance to create a completely new play that will tear at your heart while challenging your ideas of right and wrong.

<p>Our goal is to provide a platform for our artists to refine and develop new works beyond what would be possible without getting it up on its feet and seeing it in action.  This is also an important opportunity to have the work seen by industry professionals, connecting our writers/composers with potential patrons and producers with an eye on a fully-mounted production down the line. </p>
<p><span>Music Theatre Montreal was created in order to give opportunity to emerging artists while enriching the culture and tradition of musical theatre in Montreal. We are a federally registered not-for-profit organization </span><span>that fosters open involvement and collaboration. </span></p>

<p>In order to make this project a success, <strong>our goal is to surpass $5,000</strong>. Funds go towards materials, set construction, transporation, rehearsal and performance space rental, costumes, technical aspects, union fees where applicable, publicity costs, etc.</p>

<p>Frayne McCarthy is a bilingual performer whose stage roles have taken him throughout Europe and across Canada, very often in World Premiere productions of prestigious shows. Having watched and partaken in the original creative process so often, he has applied many of the lessons he’s learned to his own writing. Frayne has written for children’s theatre, collaborated with Daniel Boulerice on the musical <em>AutoPortrait</em> for the National Arts Centre of Canada, and now he is proud to be working with composer Blair Thomson, Music Theatre Montreal, and this exciting cast to bring you <em>The Virgin Courtesan</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Blair Thomson</strong></p>
<p>Blair studied piano from the age of three and began seriously composing as a young teenager at which time he completed his studies in piano and theory from the Royal Conservatory of Music. He graduated from York University in composition before studying ethnomusicology and philosophy of mind as a graduate student.  Before moving to Montréal in 1995, he was active as a composer, pianist and conductor in the Toronto contemporary music scene.

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>This four-person play tells the story of two 50-something sisters, Elizabeth Borny and Quilly McGrath, who share an apartment in 1943 Harlem. The older sister, Elizabeth, in need of some rent relief, takes in a young male border from South Carolina named Husband Witherspoon.  Husband is a sweet, naive, mama’s boy who travels to Harlem to find his lost love, Lou Bessie. He is taken aback by Lou Bessie’s manipulative ways and turns to Elizabeth for comfort and companionship.  Even though Quilly vociferously disapproves of Elizabeth's growing attachment to Husband, Elizabeth allows her passion to overcome her good sense.</p>
<h3>HISTORY OF PROJECT</h3>
<div>
<p>In 2009, I starred as Quilly McGrath in a <strong>workshop</strong> production of this play.  It was a wonderful experience, and the play has never left the forefront of my mind.  Even now, not a month goes by without someone telling me how much they enjoyed it.   I feel I have unfinished business with THE OLD SETTLER.</p>
<h3>THE PLAN</h3>
<p>My goal is to mount a first-class production of the play in the fall of 2012, with the same fabulous director and cast.  It will take place in a 99-seat theater in Los Angeles, for a six to eight-week run (Thursdays through Sundays).  </p>
<h3>WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES</h3>
<p>Theater rental will be the prime expense (approximately one-third of the budget). There will be costs associated with our designers, (set, costume, lighting and sound), as well as the Producer, Stage Manager, Publicist, Director and cast.  I truly believe in paying people what they are worth; show business is all about building relationships.</p>
<p>Finally, there will be administrative costs (insurance, license fees, marketing, props, materials, and the ever popular ""miscellaneous"").  The budget will be between $35,000-$45,000; $15,000 of it has already been raised.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE PERKS</h3>
<p>We have 10 levels of perks for your contributions, each named after a PERSON, PLACE or THING associated with Harlem.  For example, a $25 donation is the COTTON CLUB, which garners your name listed in our commemorative program, and a 5.5 x 8.5 glossy postcard of our beautiful poster, designed by local artist Loretta Weeks.</p>
<p>The PERKS listing appears to the right of this column; please make sure you scroll to the bottom!</p>
<h3>MY TRACK RECORD (Will this project be a success?)</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have been actively involved in the entertainment industry for over 30 years, as an actor, producer, writer, director and stand-up comic.  I have put shows together for audiences of 2,000, and audiences of 20.  I have raised close to $40,000 for various film and video projects.  But most importantly, I have a passion for this project and will see it to fruition.</p>

Between the Seas: the Only Mediterranean Performing Arts Festival in North America 

July 21-27 at the Wild Project, East Village, NYC
Between the Seas was the dream of Aktina Stathaki, a Greek-born theatre artist, who saw the need for a platform for Mediterranean arts and culture in NYC. Now in its fourth year, the festival has built a vibrant, international community of artists, collaborators, and audiences. We continue envisioning a thriving Mediterranean community in NYC where artists can share ideas and projects and showcase the music, dance, theatre, and art that represents them and their cultures. This year Between the Seas will include World Premieres of some of the most cutting-edge, political, and extraordinary contemporary performances from across the region and will partner with some of the most compelling NYC-based artists and companies. 
All we need is 300 people to each donate $10!
As a small cultural arts organization showcasing political works, we rely on volunteer work, ticket sales, and individual donations to cover our costs and sustain our activities. Thanks to grants and institutional support, we are able to pay technical staff and artists to cover our programming. But we still have basic needs to meet. The $3000 will go towards paying half of our theatre rental at the Wild Project ($2000), hiring a publicist ($600), and printing our promotional flyers and festival programs ($400). Any remaining money will be used to advertise the festival through print and online platforms. Since we seek to engage an inclusive audience, our publicity must be comprehensive and accessible. Your $10 enables cross-cultural dialogue between some of the hottest artists from the most politically nuanced countries and the local members of your own community.
Your support matters -- any amount makes a huge difference.


What We Need & What You Get
We are almost at our mark, and we need you to bring it home. Depending on what you give, you may receive an exclusive behind-the-scenes Thank You Video from BTS staff & contributing artists, your name featured on our website and/or program, 1-2 complimentary show tickets, access to an exclusive Opening Night Reception, or an intimate meet-and-greet brunch with the artists. See perks for details.


The Impact
Between the Seas hosts artists from Israel, Palestine, Syria, Italy, Greece, Spain, Kosovo, Catalonia, Turkey, the US, and more. We are the only festival on this side of the hemisphere engaging such a diverse and vibrant crowd of all ages, religions, languages, cultures, and ethnicities. We bring critical Mediterranean artists to the US to increase awareness about the politics, identities, and visions of Mediterranean artists. We present brand new, World Premieres of contemporary theatre and dance that would otherwise never reach a NYC stage. And we give opportunities to NYC-based audiences and artists to exchange ideas in an international, peaceful setting.
In 2014 we're creating a compelling program that raises pressing questions about the region's politics through new drama and performance, interrogates the role of arts and artists in a time of crisis, and celebrates new interdisciplinary aesthetics. Some of the program's highlights are:

Hotel Mediterranee by Greek director
Nadia Foskolou: an ensemble performance interweaving Chuck Mee's play Matisse's Self Portrait and S. Charalambopoulos'
documentary Moralis (World Premiere)

I've been having an amazing time starting my family and raising little PJ Critelli, but I'm finally ready to get back into creating art (and not human beings!). I have wanted to put on Bus Stop by William Inge for about 20 years or so. The role of Cherie is very personal to me. She came from nothing and wants desperately to make something of herself even though life didn't hand her much. The play is an ensemble piece with many different characters who end up stuck together in a snow storm outside of Kansas City at Grace's Diner and Bus Stop. Marilyn Monroe herself produced this as a movie when she started her own production company because she also felt strongly about the character.

<p>“At a local level in time people think things are fine, then things rapidly spiral out of control until they become unstoppable, and we wreak massive destruction on ourselves.” Tobias Stone </p>
<p>Where will we be in 3 years? If the present is anything to go by, what awaits us isn’t cozy. </p>
<p>Interweaving two story lines, 'Sleepwalkers' explores what happens when the fears and uncertainties of an entire community are ignored: when no viable option is provided by those in charge, who is left to take to the reigns? </p>
<h3>Meet the cast</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495009629/quj2ipafbwtyhdprxzp8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>The Production  </h3>
<p>Berlin, 1929: Marta and Greta struggle to keep their cafe open. As Greta seeks refuge from daily uncertainties and angst in Berlin’s thriving jazz club scene, Marta is finding comfort in a seductive movement promising to restore the economy and save her cafe. </p>
<p>Swindon, 2020: Nathan, in a similar fate, is desperate to rescue his cafe and ultimately survive. He becomes one of many rallying behind an ambitious young political party. His employee Jade meanwhile, only wants to flirt, drink and have fun; as long as her family can return back home to the UK soon, everything will be fine.</p>
<p>Despite living almost 100 years apart, the characters have all too many things in common. In one way or another, they are all sleepwalking. Going through the motions, deprived and disorientated, anything to ignore the fact that the times are ruled by fear and uncertainty. No one ever sees it coming. No one ever wants to believe it until it is actually happening.</p>
<p>Mirroring today's political landscape, 'Sleepwalkers' explores perspectives and opinions, often dismissed as 'uninformed' in liberal politics.</p>
<p>Created by two women, 'Sleepwalkers' is a dynamic production which is set against the sound of jazz music. A timely show, fun as well as relevant, that explores the actions and decisions that have inspired present Britain.</p>
<h3>Who we are </h3>
<p>We - Flora Thomson and Jenny Kassner - are ThinkTwiceTheatre - a new writing theatre company exploring alternative perspectives; challenging what shapes our societal conventions and conformities and reflecting the humanity behind social and historical movements.</p>
<p>We are tired of exploring and hearing from the same old liberal voices. Alienating and dismissing entire social groups has led to the precarious political and societal situation we are in today. We need to start a dialogue and engage with people whose opinions we don't share, not despite our different life experiences but because of them. </p>

<h2>The Remembering Happens</h2>
<p>I am a dancer and choreographer passionate about process and research.  When I make a dance I rely on time with dancers in a studio to shift and shape the ideas we are working with. For <i>""The Remembering Happens""</i> I have worked with three unique dancers: Daniela Antelo, Miranda Tadlock and jhon r. stronks. For the past 3 months we have engaged in a movement conversation shapeshifting the dance as we go. This type of process takes a great deal rehearsal time, but it allows the movement to be affected by each individual and fills the work with rich textures, tones and thoughts.  </p>
<p>It is important to me to compensate the people I work with because I know they are giving up time that could be dedicated to other work or to spending time with family and friends.  This is where I need your help. Your contribution will help me support the people who have given so much to this dance and to dance in general.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise <strong>$1500 </strong>through this campaign specifically to pay the dancers for their time. This amount covers 3 months of rehearsals and 2 performances.  (I will be looking to other funding sources to cover additional costs such as costumes and set.)</p>
<p>With this project I have been fortunate to have the cost of the rehearsal space and the performance venue covered by a space grant through Rice University.  While this has significantly reduced the cost of making the dance, there are many other expenses associated with making a dance performance.  The most important to me is dancer payment because the creativity, sweat, and love that Daniela, Miranda and jhon have contributed to the piece have made it a work of art that I could not have made on my own.  </p>
<p>Brian Buck designed a stunning set for this piece.  It is made up of strands of keys which sound like wind chimes when they move.   Anyone who donates $250 or more to the campaign will receive a mini wind chime made out of keys from the set. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>""The Remembering Happens"" </i>holds a special place in my heart.  It is an exploration into memory and nostalgia.  The process has been vulnerable for me because through it I have attempted to shift both the content that I work with and the way in which I work with that content.  </p>
<p>I found a group of dancers that are highly skilled in performance and in improvisation.  Together we have made something that is a little wild, sometimes sad, and that conjures up the past while being reactive to the present moment.  I believe it is important to challenge ourselves to see beyond what we know.  Your support contributes to the research and development of new ideas and will help us take this work from rehearsal to performance.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute financially to this piece, you can support us by being present at one of the performances. More than anything we would love to share this piece with you and hear your thoughts and impressions.</p>

<p>Cancer affects the majority of people at one point in their life.  A serious subject yes, but The Fourth Dog is a one hour comedy about breast cancer, marital breakdown, family baggage and grieving – what could be funnier?</p>
<p>Weddings bring the whole family together, and that’s when the problems start...  </p>
<p>It’s The Big Day and the Burney clan have assembled – including skeletons from the cupboard.  The bride is pregnant, the groom is unsure, the mother is stressed, and the aunt is in disgrace.  The grandparents haven’t stopped bickering for sixty years and don’t see why today should be any exception.  And the icing on the cake?  A couple of dead ancestors have turned up!  </p>
<p>What does it mean to be part of a family?  How does our heredity influence the way we love and hate, live and die?</p>
<p>Each show has a 20 minute Q&amp;A with representatives from charities supporting Breast Cancer care. Audience members will also have the opportunity to browse 'after thought tables' to gain more information from a spectrum of pertinent experts from wig-makers to nutritionists to nipple tattoists, after performances on 4 / 6 / 7 July.</p>
<p>Amy and Gaye are passionate that theatre is for all and believe by highlighting health and social care issues within their productions, that it is an exciting way to entertain and educate. For each production Human Story Theatre partners with local communities and groups relevant to the issue being explored in the play. Professionals/members of these groups then come to lead post-show discussions with the aim of sign-posting the audience to their local services.</p>
<p>This show focuses on breast cancer and the BRCA 1 gene which is important to us because many people and their families/friends are affected by cancer in some shape or form. But also, the play is about family and we believe the play explores aspects of life and relationships that everyone can to relate to.</p>
<p>By supporting the show, you will be helping us to raise awareness of breast cancer and the local services available. We have partnered with Maggie’s Centre Oxford at The Churchill Hospital and Against Breast Cancer, Abingdon. Through our post-show Q&amp;As with guest speakers we will be signposting the audience to the various relevant local support services. Through our more informal 'after thought tables' arena, we hope to enable people to get more of a chance to meet each other, talk about the play and then gain information and support systems for themselves and their families.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We have partial funding in place for the show from The Lottery Awards for All and The Arts Council England. However, high quality professional theatre (with a cast of six!) is expensive and we still need a further £5,500 to make sure we can afford to put the show on properly. This funding goes towards actors, director, producer and writer’s fees; marketing; venue hire etc. general running costs to put on a show.  Wherever possible we have a 'pay what you can' policy to ensure the production is accessible to everyone. Failing that, we have negotiated deals with theatre venues to keep the tickets at the lowest possible price. </p>
<p>We have a few perks that we hope you will enjoy.  What ever you can donate, we are extremely grateful.  We hope to reach our goal, but if we don't we will still put the show on, although will have to give some more of our work/time in kind.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The Fourth Dog is a show everyone should see as it really highlights the family interactions and challenges that breast cancer can bring to a family unit. Not to mention it is a comedy! Having had success with Connie’s Colander (about Dementia) and Flat 73 (about loneliness and working with the Samaritans), it has showed us there is a need for more new plays with a contemporary theme at heart, which are thought-provoking and provide a forum for discussion and social interaction after each performance.</p>
<p>There is a risk of not getting funded, but this won't stop us! We believe there is a very clear need for accessible theatre exploring health and social care issues which is both entertaining and informative.  We have a professional team behind us with many years of experience within their fields to ensure that we can succeed.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We know times are tough so what ever you can donate is most gratefully appreciated.  IF you can't donate then the next most important thing is to spread the word.  We will ensure there are links through facebook, twitter and the web etc. but if you know anyone and can simply spread the message by talking to people or even putting up a poster in your local shop, then please do get in touch, we would love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support.</p>

But also, the play is about family and we believe the play explores aspects of life and relationships that everyone can to relate to.
By supporting the show, you will be helping us to raise awareness of breast cancer and the local services available. We have partnered with Maggie’s Centre Oxford at The Churchill Hospital and Against Breast Cancer, Abingdon. Through our post-show Q&As with guest speakers we will be signposting the audience to the various relevant local support services. Through our more informal 'after thought tables' arena, we hope to enable people to get more of a chance to meet each other, talk about the play and then gain information and support systems for themselves and their families.

We have partial funding in place for the show from The Lottery Awards for All and The Arts Council England. However, high quality professional theatre (with a cast of six!) is expensive and we still need a further £5,500 to make sure we can afford to put the show on properly. This funding goes towards actors, director, producer and writer’s fees; marketing; venue hire etc. general running costs to put on a show.  Wherever possible we have a 'pay what you can' policy to ensure the production is accessible to everyone. Failing that, we have negotiated deals with theatre venues to keep the tickets at the lowest possible price. 
We have a few perks that we hope you will enjoy.  What ever you can donate, we are extremely grateful.  We hope to reach our goal, but if we don't we will still put the show on, although will have to give some more of our work/time in kind.

The Fourth Dog is a show everyone should see as it really highlights the family interactions and challenges that breast cancer can bring to a family unit. Not to mention it is a comedy! Having had success with Connie’s Colander (about Dementia) and Flat 73 (about loneliness and working with the Samaritans), it has showed us there is a need for more new plays with a contemporary theme at heart, which are thought-provoking and provide a forum for discussion and social interaction after each performance.
There is a risk of not getting funded, but this won't stop us! We believe there is a very clear need for accessible theatre exploring health and social care issues which is both entertaining and informative.  We have a professional team behind us with many years of experience within their fields to ensure that we can succeed.

We know times are tough so what ever you can donate is most gratefully appreciated.  IF you can't donate then the next most important thing is to spread the word.  We will ensure there are links through facebook, twitter and the web etc. but if you know anyone and can simply spread the message by talking to people or even putting up a poster in your local shop, then please do get in touch, we would love to hear from you.
Thank you so much for your support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In the tropical region of Laguna,
Philippines a shape shifting deity transforms herself into a wild animal that
is chased and cornered by a hunter. The animal attacks, injuring the hunter who
loses consciousness. As he awakens, a woman of eternal youthful beauty, radiant
brown skin, with black hair cascading to the forest floor, dressed in mist-like
white clothing heals the hunter. In the process he falls in love with her. Fearing
for his life, his clan forcefully conducts a ritual to drive the spirit who had
possessed him. Creators of Ba-e Makiling hope to present a different

<p></p>
<p>To be performed by eleven dancers, the choreography for
Ba-e Makiling is informed by Philippine dance master Loyola’s experience as a
principal dancer of Bayanihan Dance Company and his life-long dedication to Philippine
dance.  For Ba-e, Jay investigates the
possible origins of rural dances by deconstructing the movements, informed by
his deep knowledge of indigenous and traditional Filipino dance. Florante
Aguilar’s original music score is primarily driven by percussion instruments of
gongs, drums and indigenous xylophones. </p>
<p>Director Alleluia Panis drew
inspiration for the work’s title from stories passed onto her from her father
about his hometown of Los Baños, Laguna, “He would always say Laguna de Bai or
Laguna de Ba-e.” The diwata is said to bathe in the waters of Laguna de Bay
(Ba-e) in Tagalog Lawa Ng Bae, the largest lake in the Philippines at the foot
of Mount Makiling. Hence the title of the piece takes on roots of the classic
Tagalog ‘bae’ meaning lady.</p>
<p>Eleven dancers have committed multiple hours on a weekly basis rehearsing from one studio to the next  throughout San Francisco including The Annex, LINES Dance Center, Bayanihan Community Center and finally Bindlestiff Studio. Composer Florante has dedicated hours to completing the original score. Media/Tech go-to Wilfred Galila has taken hundreds of photographs and video footage used throughout production, costume designer June Arellano has logged long hours with his Philippine artisans to create radiant costumes featured in the show, visual artist Kristian Kabuay created various drafts of the <i>Ba-e Makiling </i>baybayin script, and we have brought on brilliant visual artist Cece Carpio to design and paint the  astonishing tropical universe of Ba-e Makiling.<br/></p>

<h3>About Coriolanus</h3>
<p>One of Shakespeare's less frequently performed plays, this ancient Roman thriller pits a star general against the common people of the very city he fights for. Without any clear way to reconcile his disdain for the citizens with his love for the country, Caius Martius Coriolanus finds himself driven into the embrace of his sworn enemy.</p>
<p>Our production focuses on the ramifications of blind nationalism, and the delusions of identity we use to justify our actions. Set on the Eastern Front of World War One, this show explores the disillusionment of civility, akin to that seen during the era of the Great War. #NationalismGoneWild</p>

<p>As a company, we have two goals:</p>
<p>1) To tell our stories with integrity.</p>
<p>2) To PAY our artists.</p>
<p>The scope of this project is far greater than we've ever undertaken. As our current budget is based on a profit-share model, covering our overhead costs will allow us to financially support our independent artists. We make a concerted effort to keep our production costs low through the classic tactic of ""Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.""</p>
<p> Venue rental for <i>Coriolanus</i> will be approximately $1000. The remaining will contribute to sets, costumes, props, rehearsal spaces, administrative costs and marketing.

Director/choreographer Ken Roht and co-composer/arranger John Ballinger have created many whimsical-surrealist, music theater spectacles together, and Orange Star Dinner Show, a dinner theater spectacle, is an audience favorite!The unlikely plot for this country musical farce focuses on Mama and her grown-up kids. Mama's crazed obsession with the famed ladies vocal trio, The Andrew Sisters, forced her to raise her infant son, Green Clover, as a girl, so that Green and her younger sister, Orange Star, could form the foundation of the next great sister trio. However, Mama's third child, Yellow Moon, was born a boy, and all of Mama's hopes were dashed. Orange Star, the sane, middle child and Mama's favorite, picked up the pieces of Mama's shattered dreams, grew into a formidable (read: pathological) caretaker, and finally into the queen of her own Wyoming dinner theater, Orange Star Dinner Show. On this night, Green Clover is finally over it!  She resentfully sabotages Orange's dinner show and reveals the big secret to all. She's a he! The rest of the family, with big secrets of their own, attempt to keep up appearances as they reel from the drama. After all, the dinner show must go on!With your donation, we will engage in a two week workshop, with ten awesome performers and a core team of progressive music, video and sound designers, that will create a presentation of the entire musical. This presentation will be designed to garner the support of investors who will help to turn Orange Star Dinner Show into an international, franchise show for the whole family to enjoy.  We need your help to take our big, first steps!Our Team:

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Why we need to raise $600.00 for this show:</p>
<p>We are producing a brand new musical, and it’s a vampire
musical – mystical, otherworldly, with characters who have special powers. We would
like to build in some “extras” that go outside a normal Zombie Joe show budget to truly bring this show to life, and add even more fun for the audience:</p>
<p>Special items:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Magical box – to be built by our carpenter to allow for
someone to magically appear and disappear</li>
<li>Vampire killing knives that need to be tempered for safety</li>
<li>Expensive fangs the actors can wear throughout the show –
with spares</li>
<li>Costumes/jackets that can hide “tricks for magic”</li>
<li>Costumes/masks for demons</li>
<li>Blood for the run of the show</li>
<li>Special show lights with gels</li>
<li>Pay for the actors – we would love to be able to give them a
small financial remuneration at the end of the show, for going the extra mile. We love our actors.</li>
</ul>
What you get: Tickets to the show! Eternal, virtual Vampire Kisses, our undead love! See these great perks in the Perk section.<br/><br/><p>And if we don't reach our full goal, we have decided the actors come first, then blood, then knives and fangs, then the magical tricks. Please help us, we want Ramon's new play to get the best from us.</p>
<p><b>Who are we:</b><br/><b>Ramon Sanchez</b>, an exciting new Los Angeles based playwright/songwriter, has been writing music since he majored in theatre arts at San Jose State University and minored in music. After graduating, he wrote scripts for a variety of projects, including radio dramas and independent films. These include writing and performing music for ""Much Ado About Nothing"", Shakespeare by the Sea, San Pedro, California, writing, directing and starring in the independent film ""Imelda and Gunter"", which received a screening at the Filipino International Film Festival in Los Angeles, and the play ""Energy Man"", performed at the New York Fringe Festival in association with Hope Theatre, Inc., New York, New York.<br/><br/>He first staged ""Vampires of the Red Moon"" (pre-cursor to The Red Moon), as a concert reading at the Academy for New Musical Theatre, North Hollywood, California. Denise Devin, director, first met Ramon, in a writer's group they both belonged to, and Ramon started coming out to shows at Zombie Joe's, as an avid fan. And a working relationship began. Denise read the script, and knew it would be right for ZJU to produce.<br/><br/><b>Denise Devin</b>, lead director at Zombie Joes Underground Theatre Group (ZJU), has been directing at ZJU for 15 years. She has directed at least 50 shows there, from one-acts, to adapted productions of Shakespeare, to musicals, to the edgy experimental. Many of her shows have won local awards, and critical acclaim, and have become part of the ongoing ZJU repertoire. In addition, she has co-written and directed 10 musical children's shows, which have been produced in New York as well as Los Angeles.<br/><br/><b>Zombie Joes</b>, 4850 Lankershim Blvd., NoHo, CA, 91601, has been in existence for 22 years, and in its current NoHo location for 15 years. Founded by Zombie Joe, and Josh T Ryan, its mission was to present original, cutting edge, experimental theatre to the Los Angeles public, at completely affordable prices, and in a one hour format. They added Denise Devin to the founding member roster 15 years ago, when creating the space at 4850 Lankershim. Over its history, it has won many local awards, produced in New York, and become a staple among LA Theater audiences.  In addition to its regular cutting edge programming, ZJU has become noted for its original horror shows, most especially for its signature horror show: ""Urban Death"", which has been re-produced many times over the last 10 year, in New York and internationally, as well as LA.<br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>ZJU has a proven track record of supporting new theatre artists: playwrights, new directors, actors, lighting design, music and more. New projects are risky, they are not always perfect, as we are developing talents, not producing the ""already done."" But art needs risk, needs new blood. New artists need a place to see their work realized with full production values, not just staged readings, or workshops. <br/><br/>This play is special. And Zombie Joes believes in it. Director Denise Devin,  lead director at Zombie Joes, believes in it, and Ramon Sanchez, playwright, believes in it. We have a committed cast and crew. We are looking for some extra help on this one as it needs extra production value.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>We are going to produce this play. We are in production, and ZJU has never cancelled a show in its entire 22 year history. But each show represents challenges. We are committed to keeping our prices low, well below the common theatre ticket in LA, but this means we must sell more tickets. New plays represent more box office risk, than our more established programming, but we are also committed to supporting new artists. This extra budget helps ensure we keep our standards high, our ticket prices low, and our actors happy. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Giving financially can be tough. But you can help us in other ways. Spread the word, spread the love. Come see the show. Put it out on Facebook, twitter, email, text, and Yelp! These are all wonderful ways to help!<br/>

<h3>What is Uncle Vanya About?</h3>
<p>In this production of Uncle Vanya we are bringing it into the present. In our immersive, modern adaptation, we are telling the story of a hard working young woman (Sonya) and her family as they live in a home that is a shadow of it's former glory.</p>
<h3>Why Are We Telling This Story Today? </h3>
<p>Besides Chekhov's omniscient awareness of environmental activism, property vs home, and familial politics, this time-transcendent story is relevant to today's ethics regarding work. It's easy to get lost in the hustle and bustle of the city. Striving to be part of something bigger is something that a lot of present day New Yorkers have in common. Although this story was written in the 19th century, the sentiment of finding purpose through working towards something greater is very present today, despite us sometimes getting lost in the cityscape. Sometimes it's about getting back to our country roots, and that's what this play does.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Are We Paying For?</h3>
<p><u><strong>COMPENSATION</strong></u></p>
<p>We at Outlet Ensemble believe firmly in compensating artists for their ingenuity, time, and hard work. Often, artists are asked to work for free, or for ""exposure"", and while we are a new and humbly situated company, we feel strongly that artists provide a service and should be valued as best as they can be. As such, we are making sure our actors/creative team/crew receive stipends for their commitment. Your donations support this principle and help us pay our team.</p>
<p><strong><u>THE VENUE</u></strong></p>
<p>Because we want to have the play set in as close to an actual home environment as possible, a setting where the audience can physically walk through each room watching the play unfold, we are going to have a venue that will be big enough to set this up in. You can help us transform a space into a home. </p>

<h3>""One should learn even from one's own enemies"" -Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i>
</h3>
<p>Project Nongenue was founded in April 2017 with an inaugural performance of JULIUS CAESAR featuring a cast entirely of women. We revisited MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING that winter and brought Euripides' TROJAN WOMEN to the Hollywood Fringe Festival for a <strong>Best of the Fringe</strong> extended run. It's all been leading to THE TRAGEDY OF MEDUSA.</p>
<p>The story of Medusa has been told many times throughout millennia, but the shadow of sexual violence central to the myth's storyline remains largely unexplored. As we've been taught it, Medusa is a beautiful priestess of Athena who, after a visitation from Poseidon, is turned into the snake-haired monster we know as a punishment for breaking her vow of chastity and desecrating a temple. After turning many men to stone, Medusa is finally slain by the Hero Perseus.</p>
<p>As we've embarked on this production, we've found the story leaves us with more questions than answers. Why is it so difficult for us to look the Medusa myth in the eyes? In this new adaptation, Project Nongenue looks to interrogate the nature of monstrosity, the ramifications of sexual violence on partnerships and communities, and the way myth continues to shape our understandings of these things today.</p>
<p>As part of the <strong>Company Creation Festival at Son of Semele Theater</strong>, we've had a team of incredibly talented artists collaborate to make this production out of nothing. All of your contributions are directly responsible for making this show what it will be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>""The gods help those who dare."" -Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i>
</h3>
<p>We need at least $1,500 from this fundraising campaign. <strong>Project Nongenue is not receiving any revenue from ticket sales for this Festival</strong>, but as always we are dedicated to compensating all of the actors and creative professionals who are working tirelessly to bring this piece to life. <strong>All funds raised in this campaign will go directly to our actors and creative professionals who are giving their time and energy to this amazing project.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, as our way of saying ""Thank You,"" we're offering some great perks to our generous donors! The cast and crew have many talents, and we love sharing those talents with you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>""Everything changes, nothing perishes"" -Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i>
</h3>
<p>We've learned so much and gained so much insight in our past three projects, which reinterpreted ancient and classic texts for a modern audience. <strong>With MEDUSA, we're applying what we've learned to tell a story that's been ignored by the storytellers of ages past.</strong> All of our previous successes were made possible by donors like you, and we need your help to continue exploring these untapped springs to uncover these untold stories.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>""Be patient and tough; one day this pain will be useful to you."" -Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i>
</h3>
<p>The challenges presented in staging THE TRAGEDY OF MEDUSA are a little different from our previous hurdles. Theater fees, insurance, rights, and other worries have been taken care of — so now all we have to do is write the play! <strong>Using the nuanced, powerful script penned by our founder Olivia Buntaine, our crew of actors has done some really stunning work, each one leaving their own unique mark on this loving patchwork.</strong> There are moments of laughter and levity, despair and horror, betrayal and forgiveness. We've risen to this challenge to create a very personal, relatable entry in the history of stories about myth and monsters.</p>

Theatre Prometheus is a small, not-for-profit group with limited funds, and your support goes a long way. Even just a few dollars is a huge help to us -- so we hope you consider donating, and sharing this Indiegogo page, today.
None of our leadership takes a salary: 100% of your donation will go to the Company.
Donate now, and help us pay our actors, technicians, and artists.
Help us rent rehearsal spaces, perform in theaters, build sets and design costumes; help us create whole worlds on the stage, worlds that resonate with audiences frequently overlooked by larger companies.
Help us tell the stories that too often go untold.
Help us bring the fire.

Theatre Prometheus is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Theatre Prometheus must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.
   Bringing our best to the stories that matter.  We may be a small theatre company, but we have a wealth of experience, training, and passion.  Our team members have worked with the Shakespeare Theatre Company, the Folger Shakespeare Library, Underground Railway Theatre, and the St. Petersburg State Theatre Arts Academy in St. Petersburg, Russia.
 In 2015, we brought The Second Coming of Joan of Arc to the Capital Fringe Festival.  Fringe loved our work so much that they've given us choice show times, and a great location, for our 2016 production of Good Kids.

All of us are based locally here in Washington, DC: we are part of, and truly devoted to, the communities that our theatre serves.



    Working with you. Even if you can't donate money, you can still make a difference at Theatre Prometheus -- just email us at theatreprometheus (at) gmail (dot) com. We'd love to chat about:  volunteer opportunities
in-kind donations
collaborative efforts   Another great way to support us is to share this campaign with your friends.  Spread the word, and bring the fire.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>In our first hour in the Northeast Kingdom Polina and I stopped at a farmer’s market in Hardwick and met the town. I instantly realized that farmers know how to listen to people.  Loui, of Surfing Veggie, has spent the past 40 years listening to the land. He’d left his career in NYC as a tour manager for rock bands,  met his gal Annie, started a family, and farmed organic carrots. Now his land is dotted with mini-vans that are host to chickens. Every few days, he picks up the portable fencing, gets the hens in their mobile-coups, and takes the girls to a fresh spot where they can peck with impunity. Fed on ancient grains, they lay the biggest eggs, and when he walks within a hundred feet, they run up with giddy expectation.</p>

<p>When we met Loui, Polina and I knew we had made some special friends. Loui later confessed that he felt he’d met members of his tribe, an appellation we proudly bear. We would spend our days off often at Surfin’ Veggie Farm, and eventually we even gathered as many folks from the town out there as we could with the local Back Road BBQ food truck and put on a show. </p>

<p>One day, as we at Loui's for lunch, he told us how much he appreciated our being here. “We obviously don’t get a lot of culture around here.” Itamar was looking out the window at the farm, the chicken vans, the rolling hay fields, the garden Annie keeps that's resplendent with blueberries, their comically fat horse Peanut noshing in her corral. Itamar leapt to attention and said “I think, actually, Loui, this is all culture. All we’re trying to do in New York is our best to bring a little bit of this to New York City.” True ‘nuff.<br/></p>

<p>Instead of trying to create theater in a field, Polina was using a field to create theater. The actors revolved slowly around the audience like the dials on a clock.

Finally, as darkness falls on the play's last surviving character, the audience was in complete darkness. It was a day before the new moon, the sun had long set, and the stars were the only thing visible to complement Itamar's final monologue.

What
is The Circus of Fear 3D?
This isn't just ANY haunted house,
it's Colorado’s first and only 3D Scary Clown Haunted Fun House! Created by over 25 volunteer
artists in Boulder, The Circus of Fear
masterfully showcases vivid 3D holographic murals and live performances that
illustrate the chilling tale of a traveling circus waylaid by a mysterious
horror. Guests are equipped with 3D glasses to navigate The Circus of Fear
through a thrilling maze of artistry and scare-your-pants-off entertainment.
 
Ringmaster
Cano conceived and built The Circus of
Fear as a backyard haunt in October 2010, with the help of a large troupe
of dedicated friends. The public response was overwhelmingly positive, with
hundreds of trembling and breathless visitors clamoring for “More!!” as they brought their friends
and families back for consecutive nights. The
Circus again met acclaim when they took their production to Apogaea, a
Colorado arts festival. Receiving positive feedback from visitors and Circus volunteers alike, Ringmaster Cano
was encouraged to take it to the next level. This ramp up of production involves building and painting more scarifying props and 3D murals, enlisting more performers, significantly more marketing, AND (not the least of which) a REALLY BIG CIRCUS TENT -- all so that we can create an even bigger and better show to now reach 1,000s of people.
 
And
that’s where we need your help -- to bring this awesome show to life. Taking The Circus of Fear production to the
next level requires significant funds. Buy your tickets RIGHT NOW,
through this IndieGoGo campaign, and not only will you be receiving great discounts,
you will be giving Ringmaster Cano the much-appreciated support he needs to build
this uniquely creative and extra-spooky circus. Your tickets will be waiting for you at our Will-Call, any night that you want to come! Check our website for our nights of operation and more details about The Circus of Fear.  (**Note that the free game of black light golf at Fat Cats Family Fun Center has been changed to the Lazer Maze**)
 
The Circus of Fear production will be
raising its big top this October 1st, in a new high-visibility location next to
the Fat Cats Family Fun Center in Westminster, at Highway 36 and 104th
Avenue. 
 
And
if all this isn’t enough to knock your clown shoes off -- spooky fire spinners, in addition to jugglers, stilt-walkers and other circus
performers will be entertaining the crowds each night at The Circus of Fear, this Halloween season.
 
 
A Special Note About Community Service
and Impact
Because
community service and youth mentorship are two important values to The
Circus of Fear 3D team, some special events and charity drives are being planned,
such as: blood and food drives; youth program charity proceeds night; as well
as a press conference organized for youth journalists, providing the
opportunity to meet the creators of The Circus of Fear 3D, observe some
behind-the-scenes production, and receive special VIP passes for opening night. Stay tuned to our Facebook page for details.

<p><em>Hubris productions huh?  What the heck kinda name is that?</em></p>
<p>The name Hubris Productions has often been fodder for the critical reviewers in Chicago and we think it’s time to live up to the snarky-ness of our name! We have a new mission and a new value statement to better reflect our outlook on theater and life in Chicago.  So just who do we think we are? We're a scrappy group of seriously snarky, proudly immature semi-grown-ups.  We’re certainly not as arrogant as our name suggests, but let’s face it – what performer isn’t guilty of the sin of Hubris?</p>
<p>Amazingly, Hubris Productions has for the past five seasons been able to support itself by keeping an incredibly frugal budget, maximizing every ticket-sale dollar, and retaining the good graces of a few loyal donors.  We have yet to rely upon grants or large fundraising dollars to reach our seasonal goals.  Not only have we been uber-self-sufficient, but we put our hard earned dollars where our big fat mouths are by partnering with a local not-for-profit every year, and handing over a percentage of everything we bring in, spreading the word about their organization, and helping out with soup kitchens, clothing drives, bike-a-thons…you name it, we’re all over it, and we encourage our audience to do likewise.  This year we’re partnering with Care for Real, a neighborhood food pantry here in Chicago. </p>
<p>But now we want to grow our productions, our company, and our audience reach.  We also want to expand our cabaret division and continue to give back to the community that gives so much to us.  But we’ve hit the proverbial glass ceiling with our current resources.  And to really make our sixth season the absolute best season Hubris has produced, we need your help.  We aim to raise at least $3,500.00 to help pay for royalties and rent for our pre-published productions, and reserve fees for our original work.</p>
<p><em>But what’s all this dough going to fund anyway?  What is it, exactly, that we’re gonna do with your hard-earned money?</em></p>
<p>We’re gonna fund our sixth season, that’s what. </p>
<p>This season we’re continuing our exploration of the seven deadly sins and turning our theatrics toward envy.  We began our season with House of Yes by Wendy McLeod, a dark comedy gem that finds an obsessed sister none too happy when her twin brother brings home not just any woman, but a fiancé.  Next we’re producing Butley by Simon Gray.  Dissipated, boozing, terminal cynic and always jealous university professor Ben Butley is facing both the break-up of his marriage and the dissolution of a long time affair with Joey…on the same day.  Finally, just in time for the elections, we revive the Chicago Fringe darling Annee Pocalypse!  It’s the very near future and the world is in zombie-filled, wing-nut-run, post-apocalyptic chaos.  Now with MORE CAMP!  </p>
<p><em>That’s all fine and dandy, but we wanna know who you REALLY are.  What do you stand for?  At its core, what is Hubris Productions?</em></p>
<p>Well, put simply…</p>
<p>Hubris Productions presents life reflected in a black box. We move you to think, to act, to give a damn and be proud of it.  And we make...                                                                                                      theater you should like.</p></div>","Hubris Productions Season 6 – A Season of Envy

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We're Paper Moon Repertory, a 501(c)3 non-profit with a mission of bringing inventive stories with exceptional visuals to Austin stages.  Despite budget limitations, <b>we believe that actors deserve pay in addition to props, scenery and costumes that live up to the level of their performances</b>.  Elbow grease and creativity can stretch a budget a long way to achieve this (in addition to producing original, royalty-free work), but rent, design fees, supplies, and marketing are unavoidable costs no matter how creative one might be.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As fate (and the IRS) would have it, Paper Moon received it's non-profit status just after the application deadline for arts funding in Austin this year, and the space was booked prior to this happenstance.  So, Phineas has been funded entirely by Dave &amp; Rachel Meissner's personal earnings, the proceeds from The Dark Monday Fair, and from performance fees for their children's play that they performed earlier this year in schools.  Regardless of this, Paper Moon believes in compensation for designers, actors, crew and dramaturgs, and all of the aforementioned theatre artists are receiving pay for this production before a dime goes towards reimbursement to the Meissners for production costs.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A show of this scale cannot support itself in ticket sales alone, even with the best cost-saving measures in place.  The only way to cut costs is to not pay those involved or to scrap the visuals.  And neither of those are options that work with our mission.  So, finding funding is critical in order to continue producing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Does the Money Go?</h3>
<div>Ticket sales have started kicking in, and all of those funds have been allocated to rent and designer fees.  All proceeds from Thursday shows are going directly to cast and crew, without any portion going towards other production costs.  Future ticket sales, again, are going towards rent.  So, your money goes towards materials for the costumes that were built and found, the vintage props, the supply budget for the set, print materials for posters/postcards/business cards/programs (Rachel created all graphics for free), rehearsal space rental costs, online ticketing service fees, and equipment rentals (ladders, trailers, lights), to start. </div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","Our Story:
â€œReal repertory...there's
nothing better - for actors, for the theatre, for the audience...thereâ€™s
nothing more MARVELOUS. To perform in two plays on alternate nights, while
rehearsing a third. To bring back the play that people loved last year, to test
the brand-new play against the great plays of the world...â€
â€œIn resident theatres...the
rotating-rep system has largely disappeared...It is, for my money, the only way
actors can ever season themselves to greatness, and the optimal way for both
actors and audiences to learn what greatness is.â€  --Michael Feingold, Village
Voice, 12/25/07 & 02/07/03 
Lenny Leibowitz and Amy Estes founded Marvell Repertory Theatre with the
intention of giving New York theatre actors and audiences the kind of
full-immersion theatre experience that only rotating rep can provide. We are drawn
to plays and musicals of integrity, power, and beauty.  We thrill
to see actors and audiences stretch their creative muscles as they grapple with
great works in vibrant counterpoint.  As New York's flagship repertory
company, we strive to embody an international standard of excellence by
creating first-rate professional theatre experiences that refresh the spirit,
stimulate the mind, and quicken the heart.
  
The Impact:
The company made a splash with its 2011 debut season, which
included critically-acclaimed productions of THE DYBBUK, BLOOD WEDDING, NORA,
and IN THE SHADOW OF THE GLEN.  Our second season is devoted to works that
have been burned, banned, caused riots, or landed their casts in jail.  We
have already received rave reviews from major New York press.  The New
York Post raved, ""Drama a Marvell to Behold!""  Curtain Up
cheered, ""The best Threepenny I have ever seen!""  Time Out named

The Need:
As a new company, Marvell Rep is not yet eligible for many

<p>As I went through many storms in my life, I didn't understand why.  I was downsized for the third time, almost lost my house to foreclosure, my car was repossessed and I was bankrupt.  For the most part, it wasn't the people that I went to church with who kept me going but those outside of the four walls who made sure my pockets didn't go empty.

<p><br/></p>
<p>The Virgin Mary Monologues will make you laugh, cry and feel the hearts of these women but most importantly you'll see yourself.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This play is not just for women but also for the man who loves his woman.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Virgin Mary Monologues are a collection of 20 monologues filled with distinction, power, love, hope and determination! From the virgin who refuse to end up like her pregnant unwed sister, to the widow clinging to the memories of her husband, to the woman who has to flee love when it becomes abusive. The Virgin Mary Monologues has a story to tell about the things that make women laugh, and the pain that causes them to cry in the dark.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For this reason, I am committed to empowering and encouraging women through the arts. The Virgin Mary Monologues is about the lives of women, staring women, directed and written by a woman.<br/></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: verdana;""><font size=""3"">We're making an original theater work about what happened when German playwright and provocateur Bertolt Brecht turned up in Santa Monica in 1941, a refugee from Nazi Germany. It was a time when the FBI kept

and Thomas Mann and Brecht himself. A time when beloved artists like Paul Robeson and
Jerome Robbins were called on to testify about their political beliefs in front

We're making an original theater work about what happened when German playwright and provocateur Bertolt Brecht turned up in Santa Monica in 1941, a refugee from Nazi Germany. It was a time when the FBI kept
meticulous files on German war exiles in Los Angelesâ€”people like Peter Lorre
and Thomas Mann and Brecht himself. A time when beloved artists like Paul Robeson and
Jerome Robbins were called on to testify about their political beliefs in front
of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. A time when civil liberties were
 threatened by blacklists, and people of integrity
were forced to grapple with the true cost of living up to their principles.

Not unlike today, you might say.

 Part cabaret and part courtroom, Galileo in America is nominally set in the 1940s. But in the surreal time-space of the piece, Brecht meets both a 
character from one of his own plays and the FBI agents who had him under
 surveillance as a suspected communist. 

During
 his exile in California, Brecht worked on a new production of a play he 
had written about Galileo's struggle with the Catholic Church. The noted
 film actor Charles Laughton helps him with the translation and takes on
 the role of Galileo himself. Meanwhile, Brecht and his friends are 
being dogged by FBI agents, while Brecht is having trouble with 
Galileo's daughter Virginia, who is unhappy with her depiction in 
Brecht's play. Then, at the very end of this troubled period, Brecht has
 his own reckoning with authority when he is called to testify before 
the infamous House Un-American Activities Committee.
 


The Show
It all comes together in late February 2012, when Galileo in America will have its world premiere 
at the Contemporary Art Center at the University of California, Irvine. The show dates are February 23-25 and March 1-3, 2012, and you can buy tickets online (and don't forget you can get free tickets with donations of $100 and up). It will be the first full production in the new Experimental Media Production Lab, and we think it's going to be an exciting, provocative piece. But to get there from here, we need your help.

Who We Are
Galileo in America originated in a workshop organized by graduates of 
the Columbia University Theater Program who wanted to create a piece 
that spoke to their reality as working artists in Hollywood as well as 
Americans living in doubtful times. The development process  included 
staged readings of the work-in-progress in October 2004 at the Goethe

But the upcoming production of Galileo in America rests greatly on the talents of the rest of the team they've assembled:

Philip White (composer)
Melody Brocious (costume design)
Ian Garrett (lighting design)
Sam Breen (Brecht)
Toussaint Jean-Louis (Galileo/Laughton)
Kristina Kahveciyan (Virginia)
Christopher Rivas (FBI Agent 1)
Tasha Tormey (Clown 1)
Jay Wallace (Clown 2)

<p>    If you know me, then you know that my dream is to go to LA and pursue my acting career. Today, September 17, I went for an audition for the company ONE ON ONE to go on their LA Trip to meet over 20 different casting directors, agents, and managers. When I initially signed up I thought the entire trip would be covered if I paid a certain amount. When I was done pouring my heart out through my monologue, the man said ""I need to be in LA because I have a 'presence'""; unfortunately this trip cost $2000, hotel and airfare included, money I do not have at this time. I've always been told that I should never back away from my dreams, no matter what the cost may be. I am determined to get to LA and if I can find people who support me through it all, it would make a world of differences. Please, if you know someone who would like to support in ANY WAY POSSIBLE every bit helps!!!   I need to reach my goal by October 6th, only 2 weeks away. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you know anyone who lives in LA or works for an airline to lessen the cost that would help!!</p>

</div> <div> </div></div>","Short Summary Hello Everyone, 
    If you know me, then you know that my dream is to go to LA and pursue my acting career. Today, September 17, I went for an audition for the company ONE ON ONE to go on their LA Trip to meet over 20 different casting directors, agents, and managers. When I initially signed up I thought the entire trip would be covered if I paid a certain amount. When I was done pouring my heart out through my monologue, the man said ""I need to be in LA because I have a 'presence'""; unfortunately this trip cost $2000, hotel and airfare included, money I do not have at this time. I've always been told that I should never back away from my dreams, no matter what the cost may be. I am determined to get to LA and if I can find people who support me through it all, it would make a world of differences. Please, if you know someone who would like to support in ANY WAY POSSIBLE every bit helps!!!   I need to reach my goal by October 6th, only 2 weeks away. 

If you know anyone who lives in LA or works for an airline to lessen the cost that would help!!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>WHAT IS THOSE THAT CAN'T ABOUT?</p>
<p>As the name suggests the play deals with the effects that bad teachers can have on students (Although the play is set on a performing arts course the themes are relevant to other courses and educational institutes). Also dealt with is the issue of students who have no interest in learning, interference by politicians who care more about targets, teachers covering their own back's instead of doing what is really right for the student and dealing with the concept of employing teachers with no experience and setting them against those who have.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>We follow Ben as he enters his second year of college, he grab's two girlfriends, desperately trying to keep this quite despite his naive and very clingy girlfriend mentioning their relationship to everyone she sees, and with the introduction of a new and young teacher he believes he can finally get the education he signed up for. All too soon it becomes apparent that this new teacher is actually too young for the job, loves his authority far too much and doesn't really know what he is talking about (I think many of us have been there). As the course progresses his begins having questions, which neither his teacher or the head of the department can answer, as well as getting even more frustrated by the attitudes and cover your own back syndrome adopted by both teachers. Now unsure if he is any good as an actor and not hitting the grades he thought he could get (poor guy assumed an acting course would be practical instead of theory based), he also has to put up with many of the students who do not want to learn, either there just for a laugh or want to go into jobs unrelated to the course. He hangs around with his two friends, one who enjoys provoking arguments with the teachers and other students and the other who has been bought so low down in her confidence that she can barely get up in the morning. Before the end both  Ben and his antagonist have to face the truth, is Ben as good as he thinks he is or is his new teacher simply not up to the task?</p>

<p>ABOUT ME</p>
<p>I am an actor/writer based in Maidstone. Aside from the college where the play is based on I received some real education by taking classes at places such as Central, the actors centre and several other institutes. I am also planning on attending Drama Studio London this year to further my professional training. I began my own writing about two years ago, I have created my own production company called 'Maidstone productions' and have a feature film which was self funded titled 'environmental enforcement', more information about this can be found at <a href=""http://www.environmentalenforcement.org."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.environmentalenforcement.org.</a></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">WHY WRITE THE PLAY</span></p>
<p>Many 'teachers' have simply went from university straight into a teaching job with little or no real experience, they are utterly unprepared to take on even a small class let alone full time positions where they claim to be professionals. As a result many teachers are lethal to a society, leaving students heads full of inaccurate information and having no skill set for their chosen career paths. Students are sent out into the world with a qualification that is not worth anything and as such have to settle on poorly paid dead end jobs and abandon their career prospects. Not only is the impact devastating on young peoples lives, as such it has impacted our society, but also gives bad reputations to the truly remarkable teachers that are out there.</p>
<p>The impact on people is overwhelming, and it is something that society and the government has yet to really address, we are of course familiar with the saying that is the title of this play, yet how long has this saying been around and what has really been done? When I was at college we were told to always write two pages of A4 for a CV, include personal statement every qualification you ever had, well we all all know what goes into one, yet an actors CV is a single side of A4. We were taught that we had to spend a fortune on keeping our head shots up to date, but in fact all we had to do was sign with model mayhem and get all the ones we want for free, it is also worth noting that out of my entire year group I am the only one pursuing acting as each and everyone else had either been put off by the teachers or simply couldn't handle life in the real world with that kind of education, and lets be fair who can blame them. The impact that these people have on society is immeasurable, it is something that can not be understated and it is so severe it has to be dealt with.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH MY MONEY?</p>
<p>So after reading all of that I'm sure you must be wanting to know what I will be spending your hard earn't money on, there are of course several factors with regards to financing a theatre performance. Payment of the cast and crew and also for securing the theatre for performance, hire of a venue to rehearse, set and props. Covering people's travel cost's is something else that need's to be addressed. Also flyers, posters and other publicity for the show will need to be printed.</p>
<p>There are various rewards that I can offer people for their support, including my previous feature film, invite to one of the performances, and a whole load of other goodies that I can offer.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p></p></div>","Short Summary

WHAT IS THOSE THAT CAN'T ABOUT?
As the name suggests the play deals with the effects that bad teachers can have on students (Although the play is set on a performing arts course the themes are relevant to other courses and educational institutes). Also dealt with is the issue of students who have no interest in learning, interference by politicians who care more about targets, teachers covering their own back's instead of doing what is really right for the student and dealing with the concept of employing teachers with no experience and setting them against those who have.

SYNOPSIS
We follow Ben as he enters his second year of college, he grab's two girlfriends, desperately trying to keep this quite despite his naive and very clingy girlfriend mentioning their relationship to everyone she sees, and with the introduction of a new and young teacher he believes he can finally get the education he signed up for. All too soon it becomes apparent that this new teacher is actually too young for the job, loves his authority far too much and doesn't really know what he is talking about (I think many of us have been there). As the course progresses his begins having questions, which neither his teacher or the head of the department can answer, as well as getting even more frustrated by the attitudes and cover your own back syndrome adopted by both teachers. Now unsure if he is any good as an actor and not hitting the grades he thought he could get (poor guy assumed an acting course would be practical instead of theory based), he also has to put up with many of the students who do not want to learn, either there just for a laugh or want to go into jobs unrelated to the course. He hangs around with his two friends, one who enjoys provoking arguments with the teachers and other students and the other who has been bought so low down in her confidence that she can barely get up in the morning. Before the end both  Ben and his antagonist have to face the truth, is Ben as good as he thinks he is or is his new teacher simply not up to the task?

ABOUT ME
I am an actor/writer based in Maidstone. Aside from the college where the play is based on I received some real education by taking classes at places such as Central, the actors centre and several other institutes. I am also planning on attending Drama Studio London this year to further my professional training. I began my own writing about two years ago, I have created my own production company called 'Maidstone productions' and have a feature film which was self funded titled 'environmental enforcement', more information about this can be found at www.environmentalenforcement.org.
WHY WRITE THE PLAY
Many 'teachers' have simply went from university straight into a teaching job with little or no real experience, they are utterly unprepared to take on even a small class let alone full time positions where they claim to be professionals. As a result many teachers are lethal to a society, leaving students heads full of inaccurate information and having no skill set for their chosen career paths. Students are sent out into the world with a qualification that is not worth anything and as such have to settle on poorly paid dead end jobs and abandon their career prospects. Not only is the impact devastating on young peoples lives, as such it has impacted our society, but also gives bad reputations to the truly remarkable teachers that are out there.
The impact on people is overwhelming, and it is something that society and the government has yet to really address, we are of course familiar with the saying that is the title of this play, yet how long has this saying been around and what has really been done? When I was at college we were told to always write two pages of A4 for a CV, include personal statement every qualification you ever had, well we all all know what goes into one, yet an actors CV is a single side of A4. We were taught that we had to spend a fortune on keeping our head shots up to date, but in fact all we had to do was sign with model mayhem and get all the ones we want for free, it is also worth noting that out of my entire year group I am the only one pursuing acting as each and everyone else had either been put off by the teachers or simply couldn't handle life in the real world with that kind of education, and lets be fair who can blame them. The impact that these people have on society is immeasurable, it is something that can not be understated and it is so severe it has to be dealt with.

WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH MY MONEY?
So after reading all of that I'm sure you must be wanting to know what I will be spending your hard earn't money on, there are of course several factors with regards to financing a theatre performance. Payment of the cast and crew and also for securing the theatre for performance, hire of a venue to rehearse, set and props. Covering people's travel cost's is something else that need's to be addressed. Also flyers, posters and other publicity for the show will need to be printed.
There are various rewards that I can offer people for their support, including my previous feature film, invite to one of the performances, and a whole load of other goodies that I can offer.

WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH?
I hope that any of the teachers that this is aimed at will stop and think and truly question their own ability and ask if they are really suited for the job.
The main aim of this is to stir things up and cause a debate, I am not claiming that I can single handedly recreate the education system for the better, but with your help this play will stand a legitimate chance of getting any one who sees it thinking and talking about the themes dealt with.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>There seems to be a thirst in our culture for understanding the complex and interesting world that modern science is uncovering.  At the same time, there seems to be a thirst in the theatre community for depth in the material that is explored on stage. </p>
<p>Indra’s Net Theater will be exploring this new territory by putting on professional plays about the findings of modern science.  Doing this in Berkeley seems like a natural fit.  We cannot do this without your help.  Production expenses are about $25,000.  The non-profit theater typically gets no more than 50% of total expenses from ticket sales.  In order to launch this theater company we need your support. </p>
<p>Science and the theater have a potentially powerful collaboration.  Theater, because it is an essentially physical experience has the ability to explore challenging ideas (like quantum physics and the nature of life) in a way that is not purely intellectual, but is, instead, experiential.  This allows for the ideas to be absorbed physically in the theater, leading to a whole new way of understanding and incorporating these ideas into our lives.  Both the audience and the actors experience both science and the theater in a new way.</p>
<p>Hi.  I’m Bruce Coughran and I am the founding Artistic Director of Indra’s Net Theater, a theater company headquartered in Berkeley that focuses on plays about science and the big questions.  <br/><br/> Berkeley is an area rich in both theater and scientific exploration.  Although we have an active and vibrant theater community here, we saw a desire for plays that really explore the big questions.  <br/><br/> I have formed a team of people who are passionate about the prospect of exploring science through the medium of theater.  We will start in 2013, with Michael Frayn’s fascinating play ‘Copenhagen’.  Copenhagen takes as its focus, a 1941 meeting between Nils Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in occupied Denmark.  This play explores both Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle and the uncertainty of the human condition,  the ethical responsibility of the scientist, the dawn of the nuclear age and the trauma that was World War II.  But it also looks at what we can know, or what can be known.  What are the bonds that bring us together as people, and what can science ultimately know. <br/><br/> We will then look on to plays that explore mathematics, memory, chemistry, the nature of life and consciousness, and modern physics.  We will use the best of plays that have already been written, as well as developing new plays, and new theatrical explorations, including ensemble-generated pieces.  Through this we hope to create a rich and multi-layered exploration of the complexities of modern science and thought, in a way that Theater is uniquely able to do.</p>

<h3>The Half-Brothers Mendelssohn</h3>
<p>Theo Mendelssohn wants three things: <span>to make a name for himself as a brilliant physicist; to bring his father Joseph back to life; and to win the love of Margaret Herbert. He believes he can achieve all three by building a time machine. Theo returns to 1908 to prevent his mother's departure, a traumatic event he blames for Joseph's failing health. Not coincidentally, this will also prevent Joseph's remarriage and the birth of Theo's half-brother and romantic rival Nicholas. </span></p>
<p><span>Troubles ensue when Nicholas and the hapless gardener Angelus accidentally accompany Theo to the past. Nicholas does not take kindly to being wiped out of existence. Angelus has eyes only for Theo's mother. As the consequences of their actions unfold into calamitous futures, the half-brothers jump to various pasts and presents, trying desperately to return to a life they recognize.</span></p>
<p>That's the world premiere play Strange Tree is opening in a month. And yes, that means we get to build a time machine.</p>

<h3>WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?</h3>
<p><strong>DONOVAN &amp; CALDERÓN</strong> present their newest work, <strong><em>18 1/2 Minutes</em></strong> at JACK in Brooklyn August 22nd - 25th, 2013.  Tickets are on sale now and available <a href=""http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/426801"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>18 1/2 Minutes</em></strong> is a multi-media theater piece by <strong>DONOVAN &amp; CALDERÓN </strong>that explores the historical, technological and political circumstances around the mysterious 18 1/2 minute gap in the Nixon tapes and broader questions of time, silence, and erasure intrinsic to one of the most famous political scandals in modern U.S. political history.</p>
<p>At the center of the 1972 Watergate scandal, brought on and exacerbated by an extensive archive of surveillance audio tapes installed to record President Nixon's conversations in the White House, lies an 18 1/2 minute gap. <strong><em>18 1/2 Minutes</em></strong> is staged as a conversation between two unlikely acquaintances as they ponder, dissect, investigate, and act out the meaning and implications around the taping system and the infamous gap that ultimately led to Nixon’s resignation. It begins as a retelling of events, but soon expands into a contemplation of recording and erasure, control and paranoia. Hidden microphones pick up the performers seemingly innocuous conversations and are played back and distorted. Cameras record surveillance footage and archival footage of Nixon floats by as if in a dream. Recycling the actual audio recording of the erased section of tape, the last 18 1/2 minutes of the piece exist as a video-sound-movement installation where the performers fall into the gap and enter a surreal world of repetitive gesture and motif, multiple video projections, digital cloning, and an immersive sound score. </p>
<h3><strong>WHY WE NEED HELP</strong></h3>
<p><strong>DONOVAN &amp; CALDERÓN</strong> were fortunate enough to be Artists-In-Residence at Stanford University once again this past year to create and premiere <strong><em>18 1/2 Minutes</em></strong>.  While there we worked with an amazing team of west coast designers including video artist Jeremiah Barber, sound designer Derek Phillips, and set designer Angrette McCloskey.</p>
<p>Since our December premiere we've been working hard all year to bring our exciting new work to New York.  We're being presented by JACK.  We've raised funds.  We've scraped together our pennies.  </p>
<p>We're so close! </p>
<p>But we need your help to make this happen.  Your contributions will go directly towards the cost of bringing our incredible team of west coast designers to New York this summer.</p>
<p>Please help to close this small gap and make this performance possible.  </p>

<div>
<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>Sean Donovan (American theater and dance artist) and Sebastián Calderón Bentin (Panamanian theater artist and performance scholar) have been in collaboration for 10 years making original performance.  Starting from an interdisciplinary and international perspective <strong>DONOVAN &amp; CALDERÓN</strong> draws on the surreal, the banal and the everyday to create new theater work that responds to present social issues. We create performances that address particular social, political and historical questions while exploring the techniques and qualities of theater as a medium.</p>
<p>Our work has been seen at The Incubator Arts Project, Galapagos Art Space, The International Theater Festival of Panama, The Brooklyn Arts Exchange, Stanford University and New York University.</p>
<p>While <strong>DONOVAN &amp; CALDERÓN</strong> are longtime collaborators committed to creating original performance as artistic partners, we also make work with many other prestigious artists and companies such as the Builders Association, Jane Comfort and Company, Faye Driscoll, Witness Relocation, Every House Has a Door, Jennie Marytai Liu, John Jesurun, and others.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT WE DO:</strong></p>
<p>Gritty City Rep (GCR) works with Oakland youth, aged 14-20, for a full school year, to produce high quality professional theatre.  Participation in our company is COMPLETELY FREE, so young people who traditionally can't access serious, long term, rigorous programs like ours can participate! We produce two shows each year:  a modern in the fall, and Shakespeare in the spring. Most of our performers start out with little or no theatrical experience. By the time they have worked with GCR for a year, they have developed as actors, their confidence is through the roof, they have a strong, supportive community, and they have set and achieved rigorous, long-term goals. In our video, GCR youth performers tell you more about why their experience with GCR has been so amazing!</p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED HELP:</strong></p>
<p>We have been renting different storage, rehearsal and performance spaces for the last year and a half. There are very few theatrical venues in Oakland, and virtually none that are small and affordable. We ended up performing our first show in Berkeley, and our second in a part of Oakland where our performers and audience members did not always feel safe.</p>
<p><em><strong>Now, GCR has the honor of being offered a spot as a resident theatre company at the FLIGHT DECK, which means helping to design and build this brand new theatre complex in downtown Oakland</strong></em>. </p>
<p>We are the only youth group to be included, with three other professional adult theatre companies, which is an incredible opportunity.  The plans for this space include a large rehearsal room, a 100-seat black box theatre, an office space, and storage for costume, props, and set pieces - everything theatre companies need all in one!</p>
<p>For $20,400, we get to help design and build out the Flight Deck this summer, and then rehearse and perform there for the next year!  Not only does this project benefit GCR, but also all of Oakland, as we are helping to create an amazing new performing arts space where multiple companies will hold shows and events.</p>
<p>We have raised half of the money we need, including a grant we recently received from the Alameda ArtsFund, but are looking for help with the other half!  Please help us create and move into our permanent home! Our commitment to serve under-served youth in Oakland by making our company 100% free to performers and their families means fund-raising is a challenge.  Raising $10,000 with this campaign will make it possible for Gritty City Rep to help create this safe, beautiful, professional space and make it our new home.</p>
<p><strong>I CAN'T AFFORD IT, BUT I STILL WANT TO HELP - CAN I?</strong></p>
<p>You can help get Gritty City Rep into the Flight Deck by passing this page along to anyone you think might be interested. Even if they can't help, they might know someone else who can.</p>

<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our second biggest expense could be rehearsal space rental. If we have the funds, we'll be able to get a nice deal on renting our actual performance space for rehearsals. But even with a nice deal, that'd still run us up quite a bill of ~<dfn class="""">$1000</dfn>. Our alternative is finding public spaces, like parks and/or production team members' homes. Which is okay, but not as ideal as rehearsing in the space.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We're required to have insurance. That costs money.</span></li>
<li>There's some miscellaneous stuff, like props, printing. We've allocated <dfn class="""">$100</dfn> for this. </li>

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Marketing. We want everybody to see the show. That means they have to know about it.

This campaign is for our debut repertory productions of two brand new plays: Un-Speakable, by H.E. Young, and Fix, by Tony Ryan. Keep reading to find out a little bit about who we are, and about the shows that you kind people will be helping to make possible.</p><p><b>PartyHAT:</b></p><p>As a theatre company, we are primarily concerned with the new, with the norms, and with their subversions. Our goal is to present an obfuscation of identity and experience not often seen in the mainstream theatre, as well as to present the opportunity for any and all artistic voices to be heard loudly, regardless of background or identity. We hope to accomplish this both by providing a platform for new and emerging theatrical works by up and coming playwrights, as well as by presenting fresh and innovative takes on established dramatic and theatrical works. <br/></p><p><b>The Shows:</b></p><p>This campaign will support the production of two brand new works, written by two of our founding members.</p><p>Un-Speakable is a one act series of vignettes about relationships, their trials, their futility, their beauty, and their universality. It is about love, its agony, and its ultimate perseverance, conveyed through short scenes containing music, heightened reality, and the destruction of a suburban living room.</p><p>Fix is a one act play about Tracy, a woman who needs to be fixed, and Geoff, whom she meets on the side of the road, and who she believes can fix her. This does not go as well as she'd planned, as both their pasts destroy any hope of their future.</p><p><b>The Venue:</b></p><p>The Bakery is a small, independently owned arts collective nestled right near Coors Field in the LoDo neighborhood of Denver. Find out more about them, and about their mission at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thebakerydenver."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/thebakerydenver.</a></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p> <p>Turns out, theatre costs money! So we need your money to make our theatre. We are asking for $1500, which we believe to be a thoroughly attainable goal, spread out amongst all of our supporters.</p><p>Your money will go to such things as renting the space, renting the lighting and sound equipment, buying props, building the set, buying the costumes, and, most importantly, <b>paying the artists involved!</b></p><p>Ideally, we'd like to pay our <b>playwrights, director, producer, actors designers, and stage manager $100 each minimum, </b>plus a percentage of the proceeds from the production where applicable. They'd each do it for free if they could, but artists need to eat, and we want to thank everyone adequately for their contributions! The more we raise-- if we exceed our goal-- the more we get to pay our artists! We think that's pretty swell!</p><p>We could do these shows on a bare-bones <b>minimum budget </b>of $360, but in order to provide the <b>best product possible </b>for our skills and talents, and for your eye and ear-holes, we need a concrete design budget of <b>$1700</b>. We can provide some of the funds, but we are but lowly students, and we need your help to reach our design-based dreams!</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In early 2014, the founding members of PartyHAT Productions produced an independent project at the University of Denver entitled Gym Party. It was a risky, experimental, and highly interactive piece of theatre, and against all odds, it was a smashing success. This inspired us to create a venue-- our own theatre company-- wherein we could continue to develop and produce experimental theatrical endeavors.</p><p>We are passionate about new, emerging, independent, off-center, and experimental theatre. We believe that the world needs more theatre run by young people, for an evolving and emerging experimental theatre scene. We are passionate artists, and we wish to bring a new kind of entertainment media to the Denver theatre scene. Your donation will help us get on our feet, and help us prove what we can do, and that our work is valuable, by helping our first entirely independent come to fruition. </p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Live theatre is risky business!

This campaign is for our debut repertory productions of two brand new plays: Un-Speakable, by H.E. Young, and Fix, by Tony Ryan. Keep reading to find out a little bit about who we are, and about the shows that you kind people will be helping to make possible.PartyHAT:As a theatre company, we are primarily concerned with the new, with the norms, and with their subversions. Our goal is to present an obfuscation of identity and experience not often seen in the mainstream theatre, as well as to present the opportunity for any and all artistic voices to be heard loudly, regardless of background or identity. We hope to accomplish this both by providing a platform for new and emerging theatrical works by up and coming playwrights, as well as by presenting fresh and innovative takes on established dramatic and theatrical works. The Shows:This campaign will support the production of two brand new works, written by two of our founding members.Un-Speakable is a one act series of vignettes about relationships, their trials, their futility, their beauty, and their universality. It is about love, its agony, and its ultimate perseverance, conveyed through short scenes containing music, heightened reality, and the destruction of a suburban living room.Fix is a one act play about Tracy, a woman who needs to be fixed, and Geoff, whom she meets on the side of the road, and who she believes can fix her. This does not go as well as she'd planned, as both their pasts destroy any hope of their future.The Venue:The Bakery is a small, independently owned arts collective nestled right near Coors Field in the LoDo neighborhood of Denver. Find out more about them, and about their mission at https://www.facebook.com/thebakerydenver.What We Need & What You Get Turns out, theatre costs money! So we need your money to make our theatre. We are asking for $1500, which we believe to be a thoroughly attainable goal, spread out amongst all of our supporters.Your money will go to such things as renting the space, renting the lighting and sound equipment, buying props, building the set, buying the costumes, and, most importantly, paying the artists involved!Ideally, we'd like to pay our playwrights, director, producer, actors designers, and stage manager $100 each minimum, plus a percentage of the proceeds from the production where applicable. They'd each do it for free if they could, but artists need to eat, and we want to thank everyone adequately for their contributions! The more we raise-- if we exceed our goal-- the more we get to pay our artists! We think that's pretty swell!We could do these shows on a bare-bones minimum budget of $360, but in order to provide the best product possible for our skills and talents, and for your eye and ear-holes, we need a concrete design budget of $1700. We can provide some of the funds, but we are but lowly students, and we need your help to reach our design-based dreams!   The Impact In early 2014, the founding members of PartyHAT Productions produced an independent project at the University of Denver entitled Gym Party. It was a risky, experimental, and highly interactive piece of theatre, and against all odds, it was a smashing success. This inspired us to create a venue-- our own theatre company-- wherein we could continue to develop and produce experimental theatrical endeavors.We are passionate about new, emerging, independent, off-center, and experimental theatre. We believe that the world needs more theatre run by young people, for an evolving and emerging experimental theatre scene. We are passionate artists, and we wish to bring a new kind of entertainment media to the Denver theatre scene. Your donation will help us get on our feet, and help us prove what we can do, and that our work is valuable, by helping our first entirely independent come to fruition.   Risks & Challenges Live theatre is risky business! We want to be prepared for the worst, but with a living, breathing theatrical production, all sorts of exciting and entirely un-anticipated things can go wrong.Recognizing this, your donations will help us to be as prepared as humanly possible for whatever bizarre and frightening challenges may arise during our production process. Having a financial cushion will help us to ensure that our show proceeds as smoothly as it can, and that the finished product that you receive is the most professional, well-organized performance that it can be!Other Ways You Can Help No money? That's okay! We're students! We understand!If a financial contribution just isn't feasible for you at this time, there are other ways you can help! The easiest way is just to spread the word about PartyHAT Productions!You can do this by sharing our Indiegogo campaign, and by liking and sharing our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/partyhatproductions.Let's do this!

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Hi! Kathleen Hahn here.  <br/>
</h1>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>I have thoroughly enjoyed the past year I’ve spent in NYC, but it's time I head back to my home state and make my dream of having a dance and fitness studio come true.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>For those of you that may not know my backstory, I lived in Asheville, NC for five years where I taught funky dance classes, yoga, and started my business, I Do Dances, choreographing First Dances for couples getting married. I  have spent 2015 in NYC studying dance, personal training for some of my favorite clients, and getting a few opportunities to perform.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2><span>Kathleen’s history with dance:</span></h2>
<p>Dance has been the biggest part of my life since I was a wee three year old. I  started out studying ballet 3 to 5 days a week which eventually lead me to the University of North Carolina School of the Arts’ (UNCSA) boarding school for my last two years of high school. I made the switch to modern dance in college and received my Bachelor of Fine Arts also from UNCSA. I spent seven years in N.Y.C. performing with three modern dance companies, making dance films, working as a personal trainer and yoga instructor, and going to cooking school. And then I moved to Asheville...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446520586/hclnyyqg7qud1ppkvvhy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>The dream:</h2>
<p>... and then 5 years later I decided to come back to NYC to be around more dance and performance and all the opportunities a bigger city has to offer. And one of the things this year has given me time to discover is that I passionately want my own space to share and teach dance, 24 hours a day if I want!</p>
<p>I get so much joy in teaching whether it’s helping couples with no dance experience  dance free of self consciousness on their wedding day, helping people realize they actually CAN dance, giving someone an opportunity to perform that never has, challenging seasoned dancers with something new, helping people feel free with their movement, feel sexy, in control, out of control, expressive, and, my main mission, making sure they have fun!!! <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I mean, I have enjoyed many, many of my 34 years of dancing but I’ve also spent a good amount of that time making sure my dancing “looked good” which doesn’t always translate into the most fun dancing ever. I am a big proponent of technique but I am a bigger proponent of FUN, and play! It can be easy as adults to forget how important play is. We need to dance more. We need to play more!</span></p>
<p>I am also a big proponent of understanding your body, appreciating your body, and living in a body that feels good. It is extremely satisfying to help people gain more appreciation and awareness of their body.</p>
<p>I believe that pretty much everyone inherently wants to move their bodies and dance, but through the years people start to build walls of self consciousness between themselves and their dancing selves. I desperately want to help people get back to their 6 year old selves where dancing just felt good and what other people thought of their dancing didn't cross their mind. </p>

<h3>A quick shoutout:</h3>I have Loretta Woolley to thank for most of the things I created in Asheville.

The space will also be available for renting during off hours for rehearsals and events.

I have used these thoughts to create systems to put in to place that will get me as close to guaranteeing my success as possible. I'm not just passionate about dance I thrive off of the challenge of owning my own business.

Hi! Kathleen Hahn here.  


I have thoroughly enjoyed the past year I’ve spent in NYC, but it's time I head back to my home state and make my dream of having a dance and fitness studio come true.

Pole dancing classes galore! Learn slinky choreography, spins and climbs, inversions, how to dance with fluidity, all while building strength.

Dance and Sweat - A class good for all levels. Repetition makes it easy to follow and keeps your heart rate up. Always good music set to a decades theme or artist.

High heels - Amp up your sass and learn how to dance with fierce ease in heels.
Jazz/funk - A class series learning an entire dance to fun music you can’t resist.
Booty Camp - An upbeat strength training class designed to compliment dance training. A full body experience will make you feel stronger in your dancing and in life. 

Modern - exploring different qualities that will expand your movement vocabulary and compliment all other dance modalities.


Flexibility and Conditioning - An important part of any dancer or human's life! Especially necessary for pole dancing to expand your abilities and stay safe and healthy with a balance of building strength and length.




Flashmob class? - I loved teaching the flashmob class. My only hesitation is finding new places to flashmob! We may have to field trip to Black Mountain or Hendersonville!





The plan:

I will be moving back to Asheville in late January and opening the studio as soon as I find a space. I have begun the search for a space and have seen enough possibilities that I am confident it will happen quickly. I will be looking for a space that won't need a lot of extra work or construction for it to be DANCECLUB ready. 
The time I've spent writing a cohesive, thorough business plan, having 4 years of experience teaching in the Asheville market, and spending the last year expanding my skillset will no doubt be the foundation for my success. 
I have had a lot of time to think realistically about the challenges of owning my own business, my competition, how much work and effort, love and persistence it will take, how to make smart financial decisions and stay on top of it, and the importance of consistent marketing and sharing. I have used these thoughts to create systems to put in to place that will get me as close to guaranteeing my success as possible. I'm not just passionate about dance I thrive off of the challenge of owning my own business. And the act of you supporting me in something that means so much to me, well ...  will most likely make me cry from pure joy, immense gratitude, and extreme appreciation!
Your contribution will go towards:
Studio space - rent for three months
Poles and installation
Mirrors
Sound system
Lighting
Outdoor and indoor signs
Fitness equipment like mats, dumbbells, balls
Website revamping and S.E.O. help 
Marketing
Advertising
Insurance and utilities for the first 3 months
Business Licenses
A small amount of furniture and decoration for the studio 

Perhaps you can please share with other dance lovers and supporters of good things?!Can you think of anyone you know that might be interested in supporting my campaign? Every little bit of spreading the word helps and I will very much appreciate any amount of talking it up you can do.Share it on Facebook: Send the link in an email: Thank you ten thousand times for any amount and type of support; emotional, verbal, hugs, spreading the word, financial! 
Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart to the tips of my tapping toes!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!
Have a question for me? Please ask. Have a class you’d like to see in Asheville? Let me know. Concerned you won’t get a space in class? Go ahead and buy a membership. ;)Photographers credit: Peter Lorenz (top photo) and Steve Clarke (in red leo)

And a huge thank you to Adam Larsen for his brilliance in shooting and editing the video.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Theatre Network of Wilmington has created a unique and accessible dramtic arts instruction program that has touched the lives of dozen of Wilmington children. In addition to after school programs at low or no cost to local kids, the Network has provided in school instruction for inner city students at DC Virgo Prepartory Academy, after school programs for Girl's Club of Wilmington, scholarships to the main after school program held at TheatreNOW and much more!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently the Network is desperately in need to funds to not only continue its work but to expand and bring on other dramatic educators to assist with classes and instruction. We also need many of the basics items that programs like this require (costumes, technical gear, set pieces, etc.) What you get in return is the knowledge that arts education will continue despite state school budgets being cut. As the Network is a registered 501c3, you will also be able to deduct your contribution on your taxes. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our impact is felt in so many ways through the young people in our community. For the DC Virgo students, the transformation from the beginning of the 2012 school year to it's end in June was remarkable! In addition, the Girl's Club's end of year showcase was absolutely outstanding! These young ladies went from barely being able to speak in front of an audience to performing heartfelt, emotional scenes packed with amazing detail and energy!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't assist with our campaign financially, you can aid us by spreading the word. Arts education funding from our government is drying up or non-existant in many local schools and this is a way that you can help restore this valuable resource to our area's young people. Executive Director and primary educator Zach Hanner has watched shy children emerge from their shells and become budding performers in just a few short months through the program's improv-based instruction. These children are learning to be comfortable in front of an audience and their talents are shining through with just a little coaxing and motivation! The program works and now we just need your help to make it grow!</p>

<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We're Doing...</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>We're raising funds to cover the costs associated with our 2013 Toronto Fringe Festival production of Strolling Player, which will run at the Tarragon Theatre Extra Space July 3 to 14. The show is written by Richard Willis with Heidi Reimer, directed by Robert Richmond, and produced by Lisa-Dent-Couturier of Compass Theatre Productions.</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What the Show's About</span></h3>
<p>Strolling Player is a creative project with a utilitarian inspiration. When English actor Richard Willis married Canadian writer Heidi Reimer, they applied for his Canadian residency. One grueling immigration form demanded a list of Richard’s location and activities each month since his eighteenth birthday. The years had been dictated by the vagaries and upheavals of an actor’s life. Age eighteen was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Strolling Player began as a blog giving the heart behind the facts on the government form, and metamorphosed into theatre when producer Lisa Dent-Couturier asked Richard for a one-man performance. Together Richard and Heidi shaped this accounting into a celebration of love and artistic dreams.</p>
<p>There’s the boy at his father's seaside theatre on the island of Guernsey, watching a play, entranced, and knowing his future. There's the paparazzi stalking a doomed marriage. There’s the fall off the stage on an opening night. A backstage brawl and a wedding ring, flung into a parking lot. Debilitating tours across America. Rehearsal in New York on 9/11, a performance for George Bush at The White House, a break-up in Venice. Encounters with Daniel Day Lewis, Richard Burton, Dr. Who, Oscar Wilde. And Shakespeare, his first love. Always, there is Shakespeare.</p>
<p>With original music by Dougal Rose and the expert direction of Robert Richmond, Strolling Player is raw, true, and beautiful, a theatrical life in 90 minutes.</p>
<p>A few sweet words about past shows:</p>
<p><em>""By turns funny, sad, and always excellent...Do not miss this one.""</em></p>
<p><em>“Richard Willis delivered with…endearing audacity and vulnerability.”</em></p>
<p><em>“A spell-binding presentation.”</em></p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who is Richard Sheridan Willis?</span></h3>
<p>Richard has been a professional actor since the age of six. He trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He was last seen in Toronto as the Father in The Railway Children, and is just finishing up performances in Washington DC at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre, playing the Chorus in Henry V and Malvolio in Twelfth Night to rave reviews. He has appeared on Flashpoint, Law &amp; Order, Nikita, Dr. Who, Lost Girl, and numerous other films and TV series. </p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Where Your Money Will Go</span></h3>
<div>
<p>Our projected budget for this production is roughly $4,000. We want to cover half of our budget with this campaign. That's still a lot of beans! We are an emerging production company and are doing our best to support Richard's wonderful show, but we can't do it alone - we need your help! Here's how your contributions will be divided:</p>
<p>50% : honorariums to cast and crew<br/>25% : promotion and marketing materials, posters, programs, etc. <br/>20% : props, costumes, set<br/>5% : fee to fundraising site</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We would be grateful for any amount you can donate. EVERY BIT HELPS! We understand how hard you work for your money so we want to offer something in return, from your name in our programs to free tickets, CDs and DVDs of the show.</p>

We're raising funds to cover the costs associated with our 2013 Toronto Fringe Festival production of Strolling Player, which will run at the Tarragon Theatre Extra Space July 3 to 14. The show is written by Richard Willis with Heidi Reimer, directed by Robert Richmond, and produced by Lisa-Dent-Couturier of Compass Theatre Productions.
What the Show's About
Strolling Player is a creative project with a utilitarian inspiration. When English actor Richard Willis married Canadian writer Heidi Reimer, they applied for his Canadian residency. One grueling immigration form demanded a list of Richard’s location and activities each month since his eighteenth birthday. The years had been dictated by the vagaries and upheavals of an actor’s life. Age eighteen was a long time ago.
Strolling Player began as a blog giving the heart behind the facts on the government form, and metamorphosed into theatre when producer Lisa Dent-Couturier asked Richard for a one-man performance. Together Richard and Heidi shaped this accounting into a celebration of love and artistic dreams.
There’s the boy at his father's seaside theatre on the island of Guernsey, watching a play, entranced, and knowing his future. There's the paparazzi stalking a doomed marriage. There’s the fall off the stage on an opening night. A backstage brawl and a wedding ring, flung into a parking lot. Debilitating tours across America. Rehearsal in New York on 9/11, a performance for George Bush at The White House, a break-up in Venice. Encounters with Daniel Day Lewis, Richard Burton, Dr. Who, Oscar Wilde. And Shakespeare, his first love. Always, there is Shakespeare.
With original music by Dougal Rose and the expert direction of Robert Richmond, Strolling Player is raw, true, and beautiful, a theatrical life in 90 minutes.
A few sweet words about past shows:
""By turns funny, sad, and always excellent...Do not miss this one.""
“Richard Willis delivered with…endearing audacity and vulnerability.”
“A spell-binding presentation.”
Who is Richard Sheridan Willis?
Richard has been a professional actor since the age of six. He trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He was last seen in Toronto as the Father in The Railway Children, and is just finishing up performances in Washington DC at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre, playing the Chorus in Henry V and Malvolio in Twelfth Night to rave reviews. He has appeared on Flashpoint, Law & Order, Nikita, Dr. Who, Lost Girl, and numerous other films and TV series. 
Where Your Money Will Go

Our projected budget for this production is roughly $4,000. We want to cover half of our budget with this campaign. That's still a lot of beans! We are an emerging production company and are doing our best to support Richard's wonderful show, but we can't do it alone - we need your help! Here's how your contributions will be divided:
50% : honorariums to cast and crew25% : promotion and marketing materials, posters, programs, etc. 20% : props, costumes, set5% : fee to fundraising site


We would be grateful for any amount you can donate. EVERY BIT HELPS! We understand how hard you work for your money so we want to offer something in return, from your name in our programs to free tickets, CDs and DVDs of the show.

Other Ways You Can Help


Some people can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help. We'd love it if you could get the word out and make some noise about our campaign by sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, and anywhere else you feel inspired.

And that’s all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Three Women is a poetic play, what would be called a performance poem these days, about three difference birth experiences:  a live birth, a miscarriage, and an abortion.  The piece was written by Sylvia Plath, poet and author of The Bell Jar and explores their emotional states through poetry.  We are also intending to add dancers to the piece who can express the physical discomfort and contortions that these three women go through as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Written, as it was, in the early 1960s, it is an important text of early ""second wave"" feminism and the issues that women of that day (and ours) face in dealing with the medical profession, with society, and with themselves.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We need $350 for the initial Fringe Festival entry fee and then additional money to do advertising and marketing, which will include postcards, flyers, and guerilla marketing.  Even a donation of $10 will help tremendously. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>All donors, regardless of level, will be listed in our program, which will be distributed at our 5 performances, and also on any websites and/or Facebook pages that we set up.  For donors of $100 or more, you will also get a display ad/graphic in the program and on the websites.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>Shows like this are what fringe festivals were designed for--artistically-oriented, multidisciplinary shows.  Very often, though, it is the more humorous, more easily-accessible shows that do very well in the fringe.  Shows like this sometimes have small, if appreciative, audiences. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We recently did a shortened performance of the piece and found that many writers and even English teachers did not know that this piece was part of Plath's artistic oevre.  So in addition to the themes of the poem itself, this will bring another piece of Plath's work to the attention of audiences--those who are familiar with her and those who aren't.</div>

Το Πανεπιστήμιο της Κολούμπια πρόκειται να τον αναγορεύσει Επίτιμο Διδάκτορα. Ο Καντ υποφέρει απο γλαύκωμα και είναι σχεδόν εντελώς τυφλός. Το Πανεπιστήμιο της Κολούμπια διαθέτει τους καλύτερους οφθαλμιάτρους στον κόσμο, κι έτσι σκοπός του ταξιδιού δεν είναι μόνο η βράβευση του Καντ, αλλά και η εγχείρηση για να αποκτήσει ξανά το φως του. Ο Καντ πιστεύει πως δίνοντας στην Αμερική το “φως του Λόγου”, η Αμερική θα τού δώσει πίσω την χαμένη του όραση. Μαζί του στο ταξίδι, εκτός από τον οικογενειακό του περίγυρο, βρίσκονται μια εκατομμυριούχος που θέλει να ανελκύσει τον βυθισμένο Τιτανικό, ένας συλλέκτης έργων τέχνης, ένας καρδινάλιος που είναι υποψήφιος για Πάπας κι ένας ναύαρχος, όλοι οι εκπρόσωποι δηλαδή της ευρωπαϊκής μεγαλοαστικής τάξης, η οποία υποστήριξε, στην εποχή του αληθινού Καντ, με το χρήμα και την επιρροή της, τον Ευρωπαϊκό Διαφωτισμό. Στο τέλος του έργου, δεν είναι η επιτροπή του Πανεπιστημίου που περιμένει τον Καντ, αλλά το νοσηλευτικό προσωπικό ενός ψυχιατρικού νοσοκομείου.</p>

</div></div>","About Us:Fish2Fry Productions is a new production company founded in 2013 by Christian Martel and Aidan Black Allen. Fed up with waiting for the phone to ring, Fish2Fry aims to create meaningful film, tv and theatre work for the scores of talented established and up and coming artists in Toronto. 

'The Eagle With Two Heads' by Jean Cocteau is the passionate and tragic tale of a Queen falling in love with her would be assassin. Director Luke Gallo's vision of taking this piece and setting it in a dystopian future raises the personal and political stakes of the play even higher.
We have such a talented team of actors, designers, a director and a stage manager. The support from this campaign will allow us to stress a teeny bit less about the financial aspects of producing, and focus more on our true passion of telling stories.  
Christian and Aidan are financing this project entirely out of their own pockets- after hours of serving wings, 'teaching' children drama and French to English translations. Every dollar counts, so check out our AWESOME perks. And if you can't help financially, keep reading to find out other ways you can help!
What We Need and What You Get:

We are asking for $2,200, which is about 35% of our operational budget. Any amounts raised under our goal will go to the rights and TAPA membership and then split up accordingly for our other needs below.   This money is going to help us in SO many ways:


$900- Set Design. We have a beautiful space in the Pia Bouman Ballet School. The original play calls for the play to take place in a grandiose castle. Although our set will be much more conceptual, your funding will allow us to hire a carpenter and avoid (literally) cutting corners.

$700- Rights to the PlayAlthough in Canada plays become rights free once the playwright has been deceased 50 years, in France this number is 70 years. Your help will ensure that we are legally and ethically honouring the author and translator of this beautiful piece.
$300- Props and Costumes

We are fortunate enough to have a wide circle of artistic friends that we can reach out to and secure some of the props necessary for this production. Your support will make sure we have realistic props  
$300- TAPA Membership
Membership to the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts will not only add credence to our new company, it will also ensure that the play will be seen by Dora Awards judges and eligible for nominations. 

Our Perks:
We have amazing and unique perks to offer including: 

-Your very own Fish2Fry mug (destined to be a collectors item!)
- Complimentary tickets to the show and drink coupons (who doesn't like to drink at the theatre!)

- Signed poster from the whole creative team (Full of future Dora, Tony and Oscar winners!)
- 1 hour Improv Class taught by Aidan Black Allen (Second City Conservatory, Canadian Improv Showcase, Second City Longform Program, 'The Fame Show' Creator, 10 years experience teaching Improv across Canada) 
- Dinner for two created and cooked by your own personal chef Christian Martel. Or make it a party and he will come and cook for you and all your friends (Groups of 2 or more will need to help provide their own ingredients)
- KARMA and the indescribable pleasure of knowing you supported the arts in Toronto.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Well on its way to becoming a full-fledged show, ""To Live, Darling,"" is ready for its next workshop (April 29 - May 11), which will focus on incorporating original music. We aim to integrate original songs written by Réjane's great-great granddaughter Adrien Reju. Through her music, Adrien will create a musical voice and themes for Réjane, giving her character even more depth. As always, your support can help make this show a success. Every dollar dramatically improves the overall quality of the show.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">** THIS CAMPAIGN HAS RAISED AN ADDITIONAL <strong>$480</strong>, WHICH WAS DONATED DIRECTLY THROUGH FISCAL SPONSOR FRACTURED ATLAS. THANK YOU DONORS!! **</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>L'HISTOIRE</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>The Réjane Project</strong> was born when Ilana Turner – sitting in her friend’s living room – happened upon a Toulouse-Lautrec drawing and Boldini painting of the French actress Gabrielle Réjane. Réjane, it turned out, had birthed this friend’s mother. And so began the Réjane Project, which then begat the play “To Live, Darling.”</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">“To Live, Darling” incorporates original text, text from the plays that made Réjane famous in her time, and – after this next workshop – original music composed by Réjane’s great-great granddaughter <strong>Adrien Reju</strong>. European Director <strong>Christopher Sivertsen</strong>’s staging is developing from his lauded physical theatre style. “To Live, Darling” celebrates a woman who lived before her time both on–stage and off–, and whose reality frequently mirrored the (sometimes equally) groundbreaking characters she played on stage. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Although Réjane’s story unfolded over a hundred years ago, many of this plays‘ themes are still familiar, embattled and entirely applicable today. As a working mother whose insatiable quest for artistic growth fed herself and the artistic and sociopolitical worlds around her, Réjane set a precedent for the world we know today. As Tina Fey said, “The life of a working parent is constantly saying 'This is impossible,' and then you keep doing it.” Réjane did it 125 years ago, and as she did, her life and work ultimately abandoned the grounded minutiae of naturalism for the detached simplicity of symbolism.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>LE PRÉSENT</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">After five years of intensive research (in Paris and the US), two development periods, two workshops and inclusion in the staged-reading festival “Playwrights Express” by First Stage, “To Live, Darling” is ripe for full rehearsal and production. Art viaCorpora has already provided development support for “To Live, Darling.” The Réjane Project is currently in talks with a second Los Angeles theatre about further development and production. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Said Rico Gagliano of the Dinner Party Download, ""I saw scenes from 'To Live, Darling' at a showcase of new work, and was struck by its humor, intelligence and style -- kind of Howard Hawkes meets Moulin Rouge. Can't wait to see a full production that gets to play with the piece's ingenious backstage/frontstage structure.""</span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Next Reflex Dance Collective and are the creators of ""en Route! a Touring Dance Project!  It is NRDC’s mission to create dance collaboratively with artists of all disciplines and to support the creation of experimental dance work. </p>
<p>We have been touring ""en Route!"" since 2007 to various communities throughout Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia.  The purpose of ""en Route!"" is to thread communities together through performances and outreach. Next Reflex Dance Collective works on a collaborative level with each community’s theaters and artists to produce a one or two night performance offering an array of accessible work targeting a new to dance audience. Such Collaboration builds local awareness and generates interest in the dance scenes in these locations.  Audiences are not only exposed to the work of their own local artists but also from artists of other communities who are involved in en route! that year.  In 2013, ""en Route!"" will tour to Richmond, VA &amp; Baltimore, MD while also providing a home performance in Fairfax, VA.</p>
<p>Next Reflex Dance Collective is raising funds to go directly to the production expenses for ""en Route"" as well as paying the collaborating artists and their performers.  Although we have received some grant support from The Arts Council of Fairfax and The Virginia Commission for the Arts, we still need to raise a substantial amount of funds to enable this project to be a success.</p>
<p>As a contributor, you will help a program in which gives visibility to small organizations and independent artists in their own home community, as well as give them an opportunity to tour and connect with new audiences.  ""en Route! a Touring Dance Project"" will expand its boundaries even more this year by including artists of various dance genres from Flamenco to Indian to Jazz and modern dance.  We are excited to entertain and educate our audiences through these various dance styles that play such an important role on our society.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are Next Reflex Dance Collective and are the creators of ""en Route! a Touring Dance Project!  It is NRDC’s mission to create dance collaboratively with artists of all disciplines and to support the creation of experimental dance work. 
We have been touring ""en Route!"" since 2007 to various communities throughout Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia.  The purpose of ""en Route!"" is to thread communities together through performances and outreach. Next Reflex Dance Collective works on a collaborative level with each community’s theaters and artists to produce a one or two night performance offering an array of accessible work targeting a new to dance audience. Such Collaboration builds local awareness and generates interest in the dance scenes in these locations.  Audiences are not only exposed to the work of their own local artists but also from artists of other communities who are involved in en route! that year.  In 2013, ""en Route!"" will tour to Richmond, VA & Baltimore, MD while also providing a home performance in Fairfax, VA.
Next Reflex Dance Collective is raising funds to go directly to the production expenses for ""en Route"" as well as paying the collaborating artists and their performers.  Although we have received some grant support from The Arts Council of Fairfax and The Virginia Commission for the Arts, we still need to raise a substantial amount of funds to enable this project to be a success.
As a contributor, you will help a program in which gives visibility to small organizations and independent artists in their own home community, as well as give them an opportunity to tour and connect with new audiences.  ""en Route! a Touring Dance Project"" will expand its boundaries even more this year by including artists of various dance genres from Flamenco to Indian to Jazz and modern dance.  We are excited to entertain and educate our audiences through these various dance styles that play such an important role on our society.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hub Performing Arts School was opened by Bob and Paula Chanda in 2007. It began as a summer musical theatre camp and has grown into something much larger, giving kids from Lubbock and surrounding areas a place to shine in acting, singing, and dancing. In Fall 2008 they formed their first Advanced Performance Team to compete at the Junior Theatre Festival. They were humbled that year to take home top 6 honors. Since then this by audition only Advanced Performance Team has served as a goal for members of the classes to strive for. It has given the kids opportunities to not only perform at community events, perform and learn in New York City, but also give back through bullying programs and mentoring actors at Lubbock's High Point Village.</p>
<p>This year Hub will be taking a team of 28 kids to the Junior Theatre Festival in Atlanta where they will perform 15 minutes from Schoolhouse Rock Live Jr. for adjudication. Many of these kids have not had the opportunity to attend before. Not only is their team critiqued on their 15 minute performance, the kids will also receive constructive feedback on ways to improve for the future. Awards are given out to teams and individuals who excel in many areas including spirit awards for positive attitudes and awards for community service. But in addition to feedback, awards, and the experience of seeing all the teams perform they also get to attend workshops to tighten their skills. Further, the kids have opportunities for fellowship with the kids from other teams where they can make new friends.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The experience of the festival leaves the kids with a feeling of comradery with their teammates and other kids around the country that love performing. They realize the importance of each member to the team. They can bring back what they learned and share these skills with kids in the beginning theatre classes at Hub Performing Arts School. Just from being a member of the Advanced Performance Team kids are taught skills to make them better members of the community through community service and giving back. They also represent the Lubbock community spirit at the Junior Theatre Festival. Finally they also learn that it is just as important to shine in life as on stage! While the impact on these kids' lives is great, the desire is that they pay it forward to their community.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The cost to attend the Junior Theatre Festival plus the cost of travel is expensive. The kids have done various fundraisers to help defray the cost of travel, but are trying to raise the final money to cover their attendance fees at the festival. Many of the team members are on scholarship and family members do not have the money to pay for the trip in the absence of this fundraising.</p>
<p>The cost to attend the festival is $165 per kid.</p>
<p>The team has 28 kids for a total of $4620.</p>
<p>In order to be able to reach our goal we are asking for $2500 toward these fees, but should we earn more it will also go toward these fees. </p>
<p>Please see the perks you can get for your donation. But know that you are helping change a kid's life and hopefully have an impact on the community as well!</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.edgywomen.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Edgy Women</strong></a> is the only feminist performance festival of its kind in the world. Based in Montreal, we have been pushing performative boundaries for the last <em>20 YEARS</em>. For this anniversary edition, we are celebrating gender, art and athletics — and we need your help. </p>
<p>Our grand finale on <strong>March 10th</strong> is <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/events/138696232964603"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>EDGY LUCHA</strong></a>: a wrestling spectacle of intense proportion scripted by Belgian theatre artist Marijs Boulogne and involving half a dozen female québécois fighters. </p>
<p><em>We want to know what might happen when you mix Belgian experimental performance art with female French Canadian pro-wrestlers...  </em></p>
<p>But it ain't cheap. </p>
<p>The festival has covered promo and a venue rental, but to rent the ring and pay the artists we need an additional <strong>$3,500</strong>. </p>
<p>Can you help? </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need  </h3>
<p><strong>$3,500. </strong>This will help us enormously to cover the costs of running an independent festival as a not-for-profit and make this cultural output happen. </p>
<p>It costs approximately <em>$2,000</em> just to rent out our venue — the amazing <a href=""http://centrechatbleu.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blue Cat Boxing Club</a> in Montreal's Mile end — for a residency and performance. </p>
<p>Hiring half a dozen wrestlers themselves, plus a referee and a half-time act, is another <em>$1,500</em> minimum. </p>
<p>Not to mention tech fees and set up/strike down... </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>What's in it for you? </p>
<ul>
<li>Cool perks! (see list). </li>
<li>The satisfaction of knowing you are actively helping women kick ass. </li>
<li>The priceless investment into the athletic and artistic development of a once-in-a-lifetime local happening.</li>
<li>Our eternal gratitutde.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Female athletes (in any sport but especially in wrestling, mixed martial arts and fighting) are hardly ever given equitable financial or cultural support as their male counterparts. </p>
<p>Think about it: </p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>entire</em> Canadian Women's Hockey League's annual budget is a fraction of the annual salary of <em>one</em> (mediocre) professional male player. </li>
<li>when women's boxing was introduced in last summer's Olympics, the main debate was whether or not athletes should be made to wear skirts. </li>
<li>2013 is the year that — for the first time ever — the Ultimate Fighting Champion is including women in a female division. This historic fight takes place Feb. 23. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our festival aims to highlight and question this dispartiy, while also creating and transforming cultural spaces for our participants and spectators to push their artistic and athletic limits. </p>

Breaking Down Barriers


Downstage is a Calgary-based theatre company with a mandate to produce Canadian theatre that creates conversation around social issues. Over the last eleven years, we've created and produced numerous World Premiere plays centred around topics that are highly relevant to Calgarians. We're passionate about creating opportunities for social bridging through our work - connecting citizens with others who aren't like them to engage in vibrant discussions. 
We know that for our work to be truly impactful, we need to attract an audience that reflects the demographic diversity of our city. And we know we want to introduce new people to theatrical experiences that are going to be meaningful to them. But how?
Our research has shown that cost is the most significant barrier to attending professional theatre. This is for two main reasons:

Investment risk: If you've never seen a play and don't know what to expect, or even worse have only ever seen boring theatre that has nothing to do with your life, why would you spend your money on tickets? 



Real cost: 1 in 10 Calgarians live in poverty, with many others on the edge. Even discounted tickets can be out of reach for many.


Sure, in the past our tickets haven't been wildly expensive, maxing out at $25, and we've always offered discounted and free tickets to special groups, but it's time to create a more sustainable model. 

The Pay-It-Forward Ticketing Model

This new program is based on significant research with our audience and community partners who work with different demographic groups, and studying emerging best practices in other cities. 


This is what our Pay-It-Forward program will look like:


For all our future programming, a minimum of 25% of tickets will be available for free at the door, first-come, first served
The remaining tickets will be sold in advance at a modest price (e.g. $25)
Our ultimate goal is to be at a 50-50 split of free to paid tickets, but with some programming it will scale even higher (like with our current show, rihannaboi95, where 100% of tickets are free)
Audience members don't need to jump through any hoops to prove financial need and can use the program as often as they want
If they enjoy the show, they can 'pay-it-forward' by spreading the word to others and/or by making a financial gift towards the fund, allowing others to have an artistic experience

We know that we can make this model sustainable in the long term but we need a strong base to start from. That's where your gift comes in! 
Maybe you watched our free production of rihannaboi95 and want to pay-it-forward with a gift that feels in line with the value you got from the show, or maybe you have experienced our work in the past and want others to have the same opportunity.

But let's not stop there - if we exceed our fundraising goal, we'll be that much closer to moving toward a 50-50 split!

<p>This Minneapolis (MPLS) hosting a Backroom Shakespeare Project (BRSP).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm Allie Babich, a senior in the University of Minnesota/Guthrie Theater BFA Actor Training Program and an honors student. In <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">my thesis research, I'm investigating a 'grassroots Shakespeare' movement that's taking the American theater by storm. I've decided the best way to investigate this phenomenon is to throw myself into the fray and make a play with some U of M students and alumni and members of Chicago's Backroom Shakespeare Project, whose goal is to put Shakespeare back where he belongs: undirected and in a bar.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>That's right: Serious actors. No director. One rehearsal. Shakespeare in a bar.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It's how Willie would have wanted it: rowdy, irreverent, alcohol-infused, and utterly exhilarating.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We'll be putting on Twelfth Night at 8PM on January 19th at the Republic in Seven Corners. Join us! It's going to be a grand olde time.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The show is free, the production is not.</h3>
<p>The performance is absolutely free--that's part of the deal. It's Shakespeare for the people. He would have charged you a penny. We're even more generous; we'll let you in for free. BUT, it is costing us some money to make that happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>While I'm thrilled beyond belief to be working with a crack team of artists from the Twin Cities and Chicago, there are some costs involved in bringing artists from the original BRSP up to Minneapolis and in their sharing of skills and methodologies. This is where we could use some help.</div><div><br/></div><div>Since we're not asking for any money at the door, if you're planning on coming, please consider dropping a few dollars in this digital hat. Every little bit counts!</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why would you ever do this?</h3>
</div><div> <p>This project is, by nature, insane. And terrifying. But that's why we're doing it. </p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","What is this?
This Minneapolis (MPLS) hosting a Backroom Shakespeare Project (BRSP).


I'm Allie Babich, a senior in the University of Minnesota/Guthrie Theater BFA Actor Training Program and an honors student. In my thesis research, I'm investigating a 'grassroots Shakespeare' movement that's taking the American theater by storm. I've decided the best way to investigate this phenomenon is to throw myself into the fray and make a play with some U of M students and alumni and members of Chicago's Backroom Shakespeare Project, whose goal is to put Shakespeare back where he belongs: undirected and in a bar.

That's right: Serious actors. No director. One rehearsal. Shakespeare in a bar.

It's how Willie would have wanted it: rowdy, irreverent, alcohol-infused, and utterly exhilarating.

We'll be putting on Twelfth Night at 8PM on January 19th at the Republic in Seven Corners. Join us! It's going to be a grand olde time.
   The show is free, the production is not.
The performance is absolutely free--that's part of the deal. It's Shakespeare for the people. He would have charged you a penny. We're even more generous; we'll let you in for free. BUT, it is costing us some money to make that happen.

While I'm thrilled beyond belief to be working with a crack team of artists from the Twin Cities and Chicago, there are some costs involved in bringing artists from the original BRSP up to Minneapolis and in their sharing of skills and methodologies. This is where we could use some help.Since we're not asking for any money at the door, if you're planning on coming, please consider dropping a few dollars in this digital hat. Every little bit counts!  
Why would you ever do this?
 This project is, by nature, insane. And terrifying. But that's why we're doing it. 

We want to be as recklessly playful with it as we are deadly serious about it.This is also an opportunity to welcome home some conquering heroes and alumni of the U of M, and to share their knowledge and accomplishments with their BFAmily and the entire Twin Cities theater community.
All of the artists involved in making this happen are classically trained. We know the rules, we understand that this is how most theaters operate these days. We're curious what happens when we break those rules. This is a chance for a group of brave (and/or foolhardy) actors to come together and experience Shakespeare as his own actors would have: sans director, sans big-budget sets and costumes, sans luxurious weeks of rehearsal. We just have the words and ourselves and each other, and you, dear audience. 

Broke?

Naturally, Denise does the only sensible thing, which is to panic and resort to the various alcoholic wedding gifts, leaving Kristen, best woman to Spencer, to deal with the situation. Searching for clues as to where Spencer might have fled to, Kristen, through a steaming hangover the night before, stumbles across Spencer's memoir, entitled ""Professional Confessional"" and begins a journey through Spencer's dubious past.An outrageously funny book, a catchy score and a ridiculously fun show are what we would like to share with you. An intimate chamber piece, in which Kristen stumbles across a number of hilarious and dubious characters, with their interesting contributions to Spencer's former drag career. A hilarious new musical, with song and comedy and most importantly, plenty of heart. The Love StoryConfessions began as an idea for a one-performer show, which was shelved due to the lack of time to fully develop the idea. A few years later, when looking for a project to follow up from A Little Bit of Life, Glitter Theatrical's 5 Star Reviewed Debut Production, Confessions came to attention again. Using the premise of someone going missing on their wedding day and a series of confessions, the idea was re-developed to become a three-hander with intimate venues in mind. The GuestsTHE CREATIVESMikolaj ChrobotDirector & ProducerLukas McCabeComposer & ProducerJack StoneBookwriter & Lyricist THE CASTKristen (The Best Woman)To Be AnnouncedDenise (The Bride)To Be AnnouncedSpencer (The Groom)To Be Announced  The CeremonyWhere will Confessions be tying the knot? The Chapel Playhouse near London's Kings Cross Station is one of London's newest and most exciting fringe theatres underneath the Chapel Bar and Cafe. Confessions will be tying the knot at 2:00 and 7:00 on Saturday 16th November and Sunday 17th November with tickets to the big day(s) already on sale. Help us to Help YouLondon has a varied portfolio of theatre available today, from musicals about problems being solved through the magic of pies to plays about dark forces in a magic world and hip-hop government officials to the happiest woman on earth (Mary Poppins). London's fringe theatre circuit is one of the fastest-growing genres of contemporary theatre and an exciting place to be a part of. Confessions of an Ex-Drag Queen is one of the latest additions to the fringe scene in London, offering a fun evening out for audience members all for a fraction of the cost of a West-End Production. Join us in this pursuit and help us make this show the best it possibly can be, all whilst having your name attached to it. The Party FavoursAll of the perks for this crowdfunding campaign are in some way exclusive to IndieGoGo and will be available to our generous donators who helped make the production exclusively or with exclusive features. By donating to the production, you are automatically mentioned in the programme under our Donators section, unless you opt. specifically not to be mentioned. All physical perks included on this crowd funder can either be shipped or given to you at the performance. Happily Ever AfterWhat is the plan after the run at the Chapel Playhouse you ask? That, interweb chums, is a very good question. One plan that is for certain following the initial run is to prepare the show for amateur and professional licensing, which will be set up on the Glitter Theatrical Website shortly following the New Year. Future Productions by Glitter will be planned as we go along, however this show will act more as the first step in a long line of future productions by Glitter, some of which we've already got dates set on. So long story short, your donations and support will not only be in the devleopment of Confessions, but in the development of Glitter Theatrical as a company. Questions, Suggestions, Confessions?If you'd like to get in touch with us about anything that you're unsure of, curious about or would like to confess, you can do so in a number of ways:Social Media:We are social media maniacs and love connecting with people through our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn pages.

<p>Shakespeare STEAM is a new way of thinking about theatre. We don't know of any other educational opportunities like this one in the state of Michigan.

The response from both the artistic community and general public was overwhelming, needless to say, the event was sold to capacity. Developing this relationship with the audience is a huge focus for our collective, and also provides a great way for us, and emerging group, to build an audience.

The show that Good Women will present is an opportunity for the collective artists as well as members in the community to push themselves to create work that can stand on it’s own and gain recognition outside of the local festival circuit. It will also be a chance for artists to create work under ideal circumstances in which elements such as rehearsal and performance space, lighting design, mentorship, and deadlines will be under their control.  This level of control will allow choreographers and performers to improve their artistic abilities and create dance that stretches beyond what has been possible in the past. All of this will ensure that we are creating dances of the best quality.<br/><br/><br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/><br/>We need to secure funds in order to produce this show.

<h3>Our Story<br/>
</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Underground Shakespeare Company's indiegogo campaign for our production of Wars &amp; Whores: The Henry IV Musical! Wars &amp; Whores is an original musical collaboration based on Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part I and will be presented as a world premiere at the 2011 Philly Fringe! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The Underground Shakespeare Company was founded at the University of Pennsylvania, and since its creation ten years ago, has been devoted to bringing quality Shakespeare-related performances to the university and the West Philadelphia community. The company has had an exciting year with the celebration of its tenth anniversary, and now with its first original and professional production: Wars &amp; Whores!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span id=""internal-source-marker_0.5869293179046865"" style=""background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0,0,0); font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"">You never knew Shakespeare was all about the hootenanny. This raucous original new musical presents the Bard’s classic tale of a prince’s coming-of-age as it was intended--with all the foot-stomping, harmonica-blowing, acoustic-throwdown tunes your boxcar-riding bones can handle. And yes, whores. </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We've begun this campaign because we are starting from scratch! Our company members have written and composed the show and will be acting, directing, and committing a major portion of their non-existent free time to this production. We've incorporated local and out-of-town artists to bring you the best production of our show we  can present. We're all here because we love theatre and are committed to reaching as many people as we can with our energetic take on a treasured classic.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With this campaign, we are hoping to raise $3500 to get our production off the ground and to hopefully continue to bring the Philadelphia more original and reinterpreted Renaissance works! Your <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">tax deductible contribution</span> to our fundraising project will help cover the following costs outlined in this rough budget:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Performance and rehearsal space ~$1300</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Physical Production including set, sound, and lighting ~$1000<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Publicity and Marketing ~$500<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Transportation Expenses ~$1000<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Fringe Festival Requirements ~$300<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As you can see, your contribution is vital to the success of our project, and any money we receive goes straight into the development of our show rather than anyone's pocket.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Any and all contributions are appreciated. For donations of $1 or more, we provide benefits and prizes, including posters, mugs, free tickets, personalized songs, artistic lessons, and much more!

Our Story

Welcome to the Underground Shakespeare Company's indiegogo campaign for our production of Wars & Whores: The Henry IV Musical! Wars & Whores is an original musical collaboration based on Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part I and will be presented as a world premiere at the 2011 Philly Fringe! 

The Underground Shakespeare Company was founded at the University of Pennsylvania, and since its creation ten years ago, has been devoted to bringing quality Shakespeare-related performances to the university and the West Philadelphia community. The company has had an exciting year with the celebration of its tenth anniversary, and now with its first original and professional production: Wars & Whores!

You never knew Shakespeare was all about the hootenanny. This raucous original new musical presents the Bard’s classic tale of a prince’s coming-of-age as it was intended--with all the foot-stomping, harmonica-blowing, acoustic-throwdown tunes your boxcar-riding bones can handle. And yes, whores. 

We've begun this campaign because we are starting from scratch! Our company members have written and composed the show and will be acting, directing, and committing a major portion of their non-existent free time to this production. We've incorporated local and out-of-town artists to bring you the best production of our show we  can present. We're all here because we love theatre and are committed to reaching as many people as we can with our energetic take on a treasured classic.

With this campaign, we are hoping to raise $3500 to get our production off the ground and to hopefully continue to bring the Philadelphia more original and reinterpreted Renaissance works! Your tax deductible contribution to our fundraising project will help cover the following costs outlined in this rough budget:

Performance and rehearsal space ~$1300

Physical Production including set, sound, and lighting ~$1000

Publicity and Marketing ~$500

Transportation Expenses ~$1000

Fringe Festival Requirements ~$300

As you can see, your contribution is vital to the success of our project, and any money we receive goes straight into the development of our show rather than anyone's pocket.

Any and all contributions are appreciated. For donations of $1 or more, we provide benefits and prizes, including posters, mugs, free tickets, personalized songs, artistic lessons, and much more! Check out the cast and crew to see if you already know some of the artists involved with Wars & Whores!

<h2>""Sister Cities"" by Colette Freedman</h2>
<p>Four estranged sisters return to their childhood home for what appears to be a wake; yet, what turns into a family drama that will unearth old animosities and new secrets that will change them forever.</p>

She is also a finalist in the Eugene O’Neil playwrighting competition and the first place winner for creative writing at Santa Barbara’s Writer’s Conference 2006. She has written many plays and has had 15 of them produced around the world.</p>
