<h3><strong>The SOUL of the Problem</strong></h3>
<p>As a result of social and environmental disaster across the centuries, anywhere from <strong>half a million to one million</strong> Haitians live in the Dominican Republic. Some where born there, others are recent refugees. Most lack—or have been actively denied—Dominican citizenship, and with it the rights that it entails: K-12 education, essential medical access, basic care, the ability to work in a career that does not involve backbreaking labor. The largest ethnic minority in the Dominican Republic, Haitians are plagued by a very-present <strong>racism</strong> and face <strong>stigmatization</strong> and <strong>abuse</strong> on a daily basis.</p>
<h3><strong>The SOUL of Our Team</strong></h3>
<p>Since the Mid-80’s, Friends of Colegio Moriah (FCM) has been assisting this population through the development of a school staffed by local leaders and teachers; biannual mobile medical clinics from the US; and, most recently, a permanent medical facility that will also be managed by nationals.</p>
<p>Mark and Rebecca, co-founders of Common Grace Inc (SOUL®), participated in FCM’s biannual medical project in January of 2014 along with their daughter Maryah. At that time, Rebecca was inspired to pursue a nursing degree. She recently graduated from a program here in Corning, receiving the Clinical Excellence in Nursing Award, and is now an RN working in a local hospital.</p>
<p>Mark and Rebecca’s daughter Maryah will be graduating next year with her degree in nursing as well. Similar to her mom, Maryah was inspired to pursue a career in medicine while serving for 6 months in 2016 at FCM’s school in the Dominican Republic. She and her mom are excited to be on the January 2018 FCM medical mission trip and to give back to the community that ignited their passion to give their lives over to serving others through nursing.</p>
<p>Also on the FCM US team of 30 are Misha and Sanna, another two of Mark and Rebecca’s daughters. Both girls enjoy home-education and volunteering in the community, and are looking forward to supporting the medical personnel on the team.</p>
<p>As he did on the 2014 medical team, Mark will be assisting the team by performing patient intake. Mark has a passion for people, for change and for sustainability. Locally, much of his current focus is on launching into the growing agri-tourism sector in the Finger Lakes of NY with his mind for ""farm to table"" and sustainable, renewable energy. Mark has also connected people around the world in the Corning, New York glass art heritage of Hawkes, Carder, Steuben and Kish and the beauty and meaning of a symbol copyrighted as SOUL® - a glass art jewelry pendant now to be enjoyed by thousands.</p>
<h3><strong>The Product of Our SOUL</strong></h3>
<p>SOUL®, by Common Grace Inc., is a hand-made jewelry pendant crafted using the finest crystal in America. Our Corning, New York artists and craftspeople use a 17th Century European technique of copper-wheel lathe engraving to create the piece which we first marketed at the Corning Museum of Glass. High-art experts applaud the design for its conceptual purity. Wearers connect emotionally because of SOUL’s meaning as a symbol for “their own soul” or their feeling “to have soul.” For some of us, SOUL is a symbol that captures the emotions of friendship and trust, or motherhood, sisterhood, and brotherhood. For others, SOUL is an expression of determination and courage. Some also wear SOUL to convey romance, passion, and intimacy. All of us wear SOUL to provide hope because each soul pendant purchase is missional and gives life to individuals who need it.</p>
<p>Though local to a community, SOUL’s mission is global. And though its conceptual design is new, it is connected to history. The circle shape and light event caused by glass engraving has been a symbol for soul, life or eternity for cultures dating back more than 6000 years when craftspeople carved dents in glass drinking cups to captivate the attention of the Pharaohs. Today, SOUL is made from the finest glass in America, and sourced in an environmentally conscientious manner. The same raw material used to create Fiber Optic Cable is used to create SOUL jewelry. In other words, the same material that allows you to talk on the phone or send an e-mail now communicates beauty and meaning in the form of luxury jewelry. Since crystal glass is neither a liquid nor a solid, it is the perfect material to symbolize SOUL.  </p>
<h3>The SOUL of Our Culture</h3>
<p>We believe SOUL® of Corning, New York, can be the perfect cultural artifact. We shape culture, and culture shapes us. SOUL, as a concrete piece of culture, has the potential to first inspire you as you wear it, and next, through your purchase, to change culture by funding the care of those who are unwell. These individuals, once healed, will be able to live fully and share their souls - their hopes, their passions - with their communities. Healthy people create healthy culture.</p>
<p>SOUL® is poised to become a cultural archetype and is now launching into the high-art/high-craft market with exclusivity in brand and design. We have proven the market, we have proven our process, we have over 1500 Soul pendants at various points of our 22 hand-crafted stages at SOULworks™, and we have over 200 now ready for shipment.</p>
<h3>The Impact of Your SOUL</h3>
<p>SOUL® is the perfect symbol to give some hope and why we invite you to support our current global cultural project: conducting medical clinics on the Caribbean Island of Hispanola. Together with the FCM medical professional team, we will be providing 180-300+ patients per day with preventative care and treatment. Together with you, we will be growing a healthier culture.</p>

We spent a lot of time developing our shoes to make sure we didn’t miss any detail, and of course, we didn’t cut at any expenses.  That’s why all Khepry footwear: 
Are made of genuine leather personally selected; 
Uses a lightweight sole made of recycled tire rubber, which allows easy and effortless movements and greater adhesion to the ground; 
Are made in order to reduce pressure points around the heel and middle of the foot; 
Allows you to relieve stress while walking because all the shoe is cushioned, and with time the cushion adapts to your foot to improve comfort; 
Uses microfiber lining with absorbent properties to absorb sweat;
   At khepry we take very serious the environmental problems, but we also have a promise to you, to present the best products. With that in mind we created a luxurious collection, with minimum impact. This was possible by using recycled wood in the boxes, leather tanned without chemicals, a sole made of recycled tire rubber and making sure that our suppliers follow the same work ethics as we do.To make sure that khepry makes a significant difference in the world we made a partnership with One Tree Planted organization, wich mean that every time you buy our shoes YOU are making a visible and quick difference by planting two trees in an african forest with a high risk of deforestation.Have a look at their project HERE.    Was designed towards the man who looks for a way to make a difference, and uses the best products on the market in a subtle yet fashionable and exquisite way. This collection is divided in two lines, a casual and a sports one, with unique combinations of colors and materials.     Our shoes go far beyond comfort and style.By eliminating middlemen and retailers, we were able to channel resources and produce the highest quality products at a more affordable price. The luxury doesn’t need to be super expensive, but making shoes with the best materials on the market has its price. Khepry is transparent in its decisions, and have the best materials, and the best manufacturers.Our financiers deserve the best and Khepry knows that.That’s why each order is treated as unique, with care and respect, so that when you receive it you could feel how special you are to us.Each package is composed by a wooden box, lined with soft and luxurious velvet. And each shoe is sent inside a bag with double functionality, in addition to protecting the shoe it can still be used to clean it.    Khepry was not created on a whim. It is the product of years of research and training in the footwear sector. The founder, Jorge Silva, has spent the last few years training, researching and working in the shoe industry in Northern Portugal. With a degree in Footwear Design, he devoted all his time to the realization of a dream, using the experience and knowledge acquired, Jorge created Khepry.To ensure that our financers receive a high quality service, Khepry partnered with an experienced logistics and shoe distribution team.We are excited to share our products and our vision with the world!  Khepry shoes are available from sizes 39 to 45 (European size). By the instructions we give, you are able to find  your model and size and, if the size you ordered is not the best, we will exchange it for you (please see the DELIVERY section below for shipping rates and our exchange policy).Measure with a ruler in cm the distance between the toes and the heel of your foot (like the instructions below)​After taking the measurement, see in our table which number corresponds to the length of your foot.  Khepry is an ambitious brand. We make luxury shoes for everyone, with characteristics that you will love. By meeting our financing goals we want to offer more products and more options.Our expansion goal is to start the production of the already created models that will launch the brand's first collection. Help us reach our financing goal so we can show you how much more Khepry has to offer! As soon as the campaign is over, we will have 2-4 weeks to send in the inquiries and get back the necessary information about the models and size of all financing. The faster we get this information, the lower the likelihood of delays!The production can take from 6 to 8 weeks and will be shipped within 4 weeks.  We will do everything in our power to ensure compliance with the schedule. Khepry is a startup and works with very small margins, so we can not avoid the shipping costs. The cost of international shipments will depend on the destination. Orders shipped within the EU will not incur customs duties, but will be subject to VAT (value added tax). If necessary, local duties and taxes will be charged by the competent authority in the country of destination. (Please determine these charges locally.) QUALITYWe have spent a lot of time looking for the best suppliers and manufacturers in Portugal, who have the best materials, the best facilities and most importantly, the experience to create a luxury shoe worldwide. We didn’t skip any expenses to ensure you will get the best product possible. ACCESSIBILITYBy implementing a disruptive business model that delivers your shoes directly from the artisan's hand to your door, we have eliminated the need for tenants and other intermediaries. The finish and luxury that you will experience with our shoes is unparalleled. We did this for you. COMMUNICATION Your commitment to us is the beginning of a long and beautiful relationship. Khepry is committed to you. We will maintain our strong relationship, offer incredible products and communicate with you at every step of the way. If you have any questions, please contact us at any time! CONSISTENCYEach Khepry shoe is handmade, meaning that there will never be two pairs looking exactly the same. However, each pair goes through a thorough inspection process to ensure the quality you expect from a luxury brand globally is present. EXPERIENCE AND CONFIDENCEWe don’t promise what we can’t keep. We have the infrastructures to guarantee a quiet process, from the order to the delivery. We want to be your go-to brand,and we hope to gain your trust. We are building more than a shoe, we are building a family. The Khepry Family! YOU are essential to the success of our campaign and ultimately to our company. Without you we have no reason to exist. We need your support to get us off the ground and ensure that modern men everywhere have access to Portuguese luxury shoes!Be a part of our group of friends and help us by sharing our campaign with YOUR group of friends.",51.0,0,"1 Campaign

This hurts a lot of people and is a stepping stone to the enablement of  more hate and violence towards refugees, immigrants, Muslims, and people of color. Thankfully, it was blocked by a federal judge, but it's not over yet.</i></p><p><i>In light of this, we've released a <strong>brand new design </strong>(see below) and <strong>donating 25% of the profits from every single tee</strong> ordered during this campaign to the International Rescue Committee, an organization committed to supporting and empowering refugees and people who've been affected by conflict and disaster to rebuild their lives in dignity.</i></p><h3>WHY</h3><p>It struck us that there was so much we wanted to express about ourselves and our beliefs beyond the halls of Facebook and dinnertime conversations. We wanted to wear clothes that meant something to us and represented our worldview, and we suspect that you may feel the same.</p><p>Let’s celebrate and promote our differences because that’s what we love about this country. Share your culture, your experiences, what you love, your worries, how you see the world. All in one shirt (no, really).</p><p>The designs are meant to be thought-provoking and inclusive. They’re a way to express what you believe every day, wherever you go. By incorporating subtle phrases and colors into our designs, our aim is to create images that could spur open dialogue.</p><h3>VISION</h3><p>We’re living in a unique and strange time in this country’s history. Like many people, we’ve had our eyes glued to the news this past election cycle. While we voted, there’s a lot more we can do to convey our values. Our vision is to turn Interim Apparel into a true brand and take it beyond tees. This campaign is the first step to reaching that goal and you're integral to making it happen.</p><h3>DESIGNS</h3><p>Every single person we've asked for feedback from on our two designs has a different interpretation. That’s our purpose and what we love about these tees - they’re an open forum for different thoughts, ideas, and experiences.</p><p>It makes us smile to watch a person’s reaction when we show them one of the designs and ask, “what does that mean to you?"". You can see the wheels start to churn inside their minds and a splay of emotions play across their faces as they consider, deep down, the complexity of what they see.

This hurts a lot of people and is a stepping stone to the enablement of  more hate and violence towards refugees, immigrants, Muslims, and people of color. Thankfully, it was blocked by a federal judge, but it's not over yet.In light of this, we've released a brand new design (see below) and donating 25% of the profits from every single tee ordered during this campaign to the International Rescue Committee, an organization committed to supporting and empowering refugees and people who've been affected by conflict and disaster to rebuild their lives in dignity.WHYIt struck us that there was so much we wanted to express about ourselves and our beliefs beyond the halls of Facebook and dinnertime conversations. We wanted to wear clothes that meant something to us and represented our worldview, and we suspect that you may feel the same.Let’s celebrate and promote our differences because that’s what we love about this country. Share your culture, your experiences, what you love, your worries, how you see the world. All in one shirt (no, really).The designs are meant to be thought-provoking and inclusive. They’re a way to express what you believe every day, wherever you go. By incorporating subtle phrases and colors into our designs, our aim is to create images that could spur open dialogue.VISIONWe’re living in a unique and strange time in this country’s history. Like many people, we’ve had our eyes glued to the news this past election cycle. While we voted, there’s a lot more we can do to convey our values. Our vision is to turn Interim Apparel into a true brand and take it beyond tees. This campaign is the first step to reaching that goal and you're integral to making it happen.DESIGNSEvery single person we've asked for feedback from on our two designs has a different interpretation. That’s our purpose and what we love about these tees - they’re an open forum for different thoughts, ideas, and experiences.It makes us smile to watch a person’s reaction when we show them one of the designs and ask, “what does that mean to you?"". You can see the wheels start to churn inside their minds and a splay of emotions play across their faces as they consider, deep down, the complexity of what they see. It’s both exciting and extremely gratifying to watch.Please see the image carousel underneath the video for more photosWe offer both women's and men's/unisex fits *NEW DESIGN*About the ShirtsThis will be the softest tee you've ever owned! We didn't cut corners.

<p>As an entrepreneur, I believe that our mission is to be able to listen to the needs of a certain group of people, create a solution, and bring it to the market. That's the reason why I started my travel a few years ago, and I have been living and working in different countries, sleeping in airports, hostels, couch surfing, Airbnb, ... Only God knows.</p>
<p>On my way, I had the chance to cross paths with lots of people from different places, and different backgrounds. Exchange stories and experiences, share ideas and listen to their problems with an active listening attitude. With this project in mind, I started to enquiry some fellow travellers about what they would like to improve in their backpacks and I carefully kept the record among my travel notes.</p>
<p>After a deep and comprehensive read and handpicking the core ideas, I started the R&amp;D stage. Materials, designs, similar products, tech improvements and manufacturers... </p>

<p>Do you love to move? Do you want stylish and functional pants with big zipper pockets that you can wear anytime, anywhere? If yes, Avenqi is made for you! Avenqi is the first, women-focused, movement culture brand founded by a parkour woman of color. Our designs are created in-house and can’t be found anywhere else. They are made for people who love movement and want functional, high-quality clothes that can seamlessly integrate into your daily life so you can wear anytime, anywhere, and look good!</p>
<p>The name Avenqi is created from the words Aventail, and Qi. Aventail is a medieval piece of armor that protects the neck and shoulders, and Qi means energy or life-force in Chinese. These two words combine the founder’s fascination with medieval knights and castles, and her origins in China.</p>
<p>Avenqi aims to provide a solution to the lack of women clothing options and accurate female representation and presence within the alternative movement community. Whether you do parkour, MovNat, martial arts, climbing, or other types of movement, our clothes are made for you! </p>
<p>Avenqi is both created and inspired by powerful women in movement doing what they love and on a continuous journey for self-improvement in their practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an ALL OR NOTHING CAMPAIGN! This amazing project will only get funded if we meet our goal.</p>
<p>$20,000 goes toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing the black joggers with important upgrades to YKK zippers.</li>
<li>Future inventory for more original designs and products, including tops, bottoms, and even shoes!</li>

<h3>Celebrating Movement Culture: </h3>
<p>What is “movement culture?” It is a collective of functional training methods emphasizing functional/primal movements, mobility, and longevity. It is more about enjoying the process, self-improvement and exploration, and realizing that all different types of movement is connected, whether it’s throwing, catching, crawling, rolling, swimming, climbing, running, or jumping.</p>

Do you want stylish and functional pants with big zipper pockets that you can wear anytime, anywhere? If yes, Avenqi is made for you! Avenqi is the first, women-focused, movement culture brand founded by a parkour woman of color. Our designs are created in-house and can’t be found anywhere else. They are made for people who love movement and want functional, high-quality clothes that can seamlessly integrate into your daily life so you can wear anytime, anywhere, and look good!
The name Avenqi is created from the words Aventail, and Qi. Aventail is a medieval piece of armor that protects the neck and shoulders, and Qi means energy or life-force in Chinese. These two words combine the founder’s fascination with medieval knights and castles, and her origins in China.
Avenqi aims to provide a solution to the lack of women clothing options and accurate female representation and presence within the alternative movement community. Whether you do parkour, MovNat, martial arts, climbing, or other types of movement, our clothes are made for you! 
Avenqi is both created and inspired by powerful women in movement doing what they love and on a continuous journey for self-improvement in their practice.
 
This is an ALL OR NOTHING CAMPAIGN! This amazing project will only get funded if we meet our goal.
$20,000 goes toward:

Producing the black joggers with important upgrades to YKK zippers.
Future inventory for more original designs and products, including tops, bottoms, and even shoes!
Business services and setup fees.
Packaging, shipping, and other office/business supplies.

You may have the best product in the world, but if you’re unable to fulfill your customer demands in a timely fashion... Well, I think you know where I’m headed.

<p>We have worked very hard to close the “order to receipt” gaps by identifying manufacturers providing end to end supply chain solutions, and minimizing the number of entities in the overall fulfillment process.</p>
<p>However, working with other vendors and manufacturers does open up more opportunities for delay in the manufacturing and distribution process. We are committed to do everything in our power to deliver our product on time, but a potential setback could be based on factors beyond our control. In the event that this occurs, please be assured that we are working diligently to get everything on track.</p>
<p>We will endeavor to be as transparent and timely with our communication, which is something we can definitely control 100 percent of the time.

<h3>Investment</h3>
<p>In order to build our first zero emissions store, we need $110,000. The money will go to the manufacturing of the store (electric van) and the cost of goods (your full canvas suit). </p>
<p><strong>We need to raise the full amount in order to deliver on our promises, </strong>that's why we have a fixed goal. We are committed to providing the best quality suits using 3D/AR technology. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Tylmen will only utilize electric vans, ensuring a zero emissions storefront. Our garments will be made to order allowing us to also reduce our carbon footprint with manufacturing. We are invested in building a sustainable environment that empowers the people who live in it.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have manufacture and supply chain partners as well as a functional design layout of our store. We're in conversation with a couple electric car manufacturers and have good understanding of the time it will take to deliver our electric store. Our founder is a MBA student at Washington University's Olin Business School with an extensive network of mentors, professors, and entrepreneurs to assist and advise with the development.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word. Follow us on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thetylmen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">instagram @thetylmen.</a> </p>
<p>As a current graduate student and former D1 football player, I know how difficult it can be to get a custom suit. Suits provide a new level of confidence, and I want to make sure there is an affordable, high quality option out there for every kind of customer. I believe integrating technology and sustainability is the next evolution of retail that will make Tylmen products accessible throughout the entire country. The launch of our zero emissions storefront and electric van will help us meet this goal. </p>

""If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life.""
- Marcus Garvey 
Investment
In order to build our first zero emissions store, we need $110,000. The money will go to the manufacturing of the store (electric van) and the cost of goods (your full canvas suit). 
We need to raise the full amount in order to deliver on our promises, that's why we have a fixed goal. We are committed to providing the best quality suits using 3D/AR technology. 
The Impact
Tylmen will only utilize electric vans, ensuring a zero emissions storefront. Our garments will be made to order allowing us to also reduce our carbon footprint with manufacturing. We are invested in building a sustainable environment that empowers the people who live in it.
Risks & Challenges
We have manufacture and supply chain partners as well as a functional design layout of our store. We're in conversation with a couple electric car manufacturers and have good understanding of the time it will take to deliver our electric store. Our founder is a MBA student at Washington University's Olin Business School with an extensive network of mentors, professors, and entrepreneurs to assist and advise with the development.
Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word. Follow us on instagram @thetylmen. 
As a current graduate student and former D1 football player, I know how difficult it can be to get a custom suit. Suits provide a new level of confidence, and I want to make sure there is an affordable, high quality option out there for every kind of customer. I believe integrating technology and sustainability is the next evolution of retail that will make Tylmen products accessible throughout the entire country. The launch of our zero emissions storefront and electric van will help us meet this goal. 
Thank you for your support! 
We cannot wait to see you on the tour.

high quality mechanical timepieces inspired by science. By pairing our passion
of watches and science, we created a unique platform to raise awareness of certain
diseases. Starting off with our Mito watch, we are raising awareness for
<i>mitochondrial disease</i>.<br/><br/><p>The name <i>Mito </i>is derived from the cellular organelle found in our bodies - the mitochondrion. Mitochondria are the power houses of our bodies that utilize the glucose/sugars from our food and convert them into energy in order for us to function. Each cell in our body contains thousands of copies of mitochondrial DNA (the blueprint to create functional mitochondria). However, for every 1/4,000 people, a mutation within the mitochondrial DNA may arise, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Impairment of mitochondrial function results in several developmental disorders, muscle weakness/pain, and even organ failure.  Simply put, without healthy mitochondria, we would cease to function. <br/></p>
<p>By creating the Mito, we hope to spark public interest in what mitochondria are and the debilitating disease people have to live with. For every watch sold, a portion of the funds will go directly to
foundations supporting mitochondrial research.</p><p><i><b>This watch isn't just a fashion piece, it's a support for a good cause!</b></i><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1164666/files/20150121085644-black_dial_full.jpg?1421859404"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437566885/bizj2mbeldruqdpuqvfx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3><b>The Design:</b></h3>
<p>The

(represented by small dashes around the perimeter of the dial). This map is the

<p><b>Science
+ Watches = A Unique Inspiration</b></p>
<p>We
wanted to create a watch with a story – something that can act as a
conversation piece. The Mito has been designed and created to create awareness
of mitochondrial disease.</p>
<p>In
terms of the watch itself, we have spared no expense at providing you a watch
with materials and features that many rivals don’t offer at this price point:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">domed sapphire crystal - usually an
extra when it comes to watches, comes standard with the Mito. Sapphire crystal
provides the maximum protection against scratches.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">anti-reflective (AR) coating - once
again, usually an extra, is another standard feature on the Mito. AR coating
means maximum clarity in all lighting conditions.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">150 meter water resistance (WR) +
screw-down crown - typical classically designed watches would come with a very
low WR (&lt; 50 meters). However, we wanted to make sure you could, for example,
go for a swim with your Mito. Therefore, we have designed a case that is
pressure tested to 150 meters. (Note: the crown [attached at 3 o'clock position
used to adjust the time] must be pushed down closed to ensure water-tightness)  </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Miyota 9015 automatic movement -
created by the world-renowned Japanese watch company Citizen, the Miyota 9015
has become a largely popular choice for automatic movements. The Miyota 9015
has been a tried-and-true competitor to the commonly used Swiss movements. An
automatic movement means that this watch does not contain a battery. In fact,
when worn, the action/movement of your wrist rotates a rotor that winds the
watch. When fully wound, you can expect the watch to run for 48 hours if left off your wrist.</span></li>

<p>As with any project, finding a good manufacturer is not an easy task. After a long search, we are confident that we have found a manufacturer that is able to provide our customers a quality timepiece. We have acquired three working prototypes (one of each dial style) which have exceeded every measure in terms of quality and control.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In terms of the design of the watch, the prototypes of the three Mito's we have acquired have luminescent hour and minute hands (and hour markers for the brushed stainless-steel dial). However, due to the minimal thickness of the hour and minute hands, the manufacturer could not apply enough luminescent material. Thus, this resulted in poor luminescence in dark conditions. We are actively trying our best to see what the best option will be in order to resolve this issue. The following are the two options: 1) slightly altering the hour/minute hands, increasing thickness to allow more luminescent material, or 2) opting out of luminescent material and providing polished hands. We will work with our manufacturer to determine what would be best for the watch. </span><br/></p>

Impairment of mitochondrial function results in several developmental disorders, muscle weakness/pain, and even organ failure.  Simply put, without healthy mitochondria, we would cease to function. 
By creating the Mito, we hope to spark public interest in what mitochondria are and the debilitating disease people have to live with. For every watch sold, a portion of the funds will go directly to
foundations supporting mitochondrial research.This watch isn't just a fashion piece, it's a support for a good cause!The Design:
The
inner bezel of the watch contains a unique twist – the mitochondrial DNA map
(represented by small dashes around the perimeter of the dial). This map is the
blueprint for the development of mitochondria in our bodies. 
The Mito - mitochondrial DNA map (highlighted in red)
 The Mito features:

What makes us different than the rest:
Science
+ Watches = A Unique Inspiration
We
wanted to create a watch with a story – something that can act as a
conversation piece. The Mito has been designed and created to create awareness
of mitochondrial disease.
In
terms of the watch itself, we have spared no expense at providing you a watch
with materials and features that many rivals don’t offer at this price point:


domed sapphire crystal - usually an
extra when it comes to watches, comes standard with the Mito. Sapphire crystal
provides the maximum protection against scratches.


anti-reflective (AR) coating - once
again, usually an extra, is another standard feature on the Mito. AR coating
means maximum clarity in all lighting conditions.


150 meter water resistance (WR) +
screw-down crown - typical classically designed watches would come with a very
low WR (< 50 meters). However, we wanted to make sure you could, for example,
go for a swim with your Mito. Therefore, we have designed a case that is
pressure tested to 150 meters. (Note: the crown [attached at 3 o'clock position
used to adjust the time] must be pushed down closed to ensure water-tightness)  

Miyota 9015 automatic movement -
created by the world-renowned Japanese watch company Citizen, the Miyota 9015
has become a largely popular choice for automatic movements. The Miyota 9015
has been a tried-and-true competitor to the commonly used Swiss movements. An
automatic movement means that this watch does not contain a battery. In fact,
when worn, the action/movement of your wrist rotates a rotor that winds the
watch. When fully wound, you can expect the watch to run for 48 hours if left off your wrist.
The Perks - What do YOU get?1 - Your choice of a dial colour (black, silver, stainless-steel finish)
2 - A black genuine leather strap
3 - A protective watch travel case (that can hold up to three 40mm sized watches!)






4* - A 20mm black NATO strap. 


*if selected as an additional perk (Thank you card + 20mm black NATO strap).
For watch perks - Note: please add (B) for black, (S) for silver, or (SS) for stainless-steel in your Shipping Address Name! Example: ""(B) NAME""



Timeline:

Risks and challenges:

As with any project, finding a good manufacturer is not an easy task. After a long search, we are confident that we have found a manufacturer that is able to provide our customers a quality timepiece. We have acquired three working prototypes (one of each dial style) which have exceeded every measure in terms of quality and control.
In terms of the design of the watch, the prototypes of the three Mito's we have acquired have luminescent hour and minute hands (and hour markers for the brushed stainless-steel dial). However, due to the minimal thickness of the hour and minute hands, the manufacturer could not apply enough luminescent material. Thus, this resulted in poor luminescence in dark conditions. We are actively trying our best to see what the best option will be in order to resolve this issue. The following are the two options: 1) slightly altering the hour/minute hands, increasing thickness to allow more luminescent material, or 2) opting out of luminescent material and providing polished hands. We will work with our manufacturer to determine what would be best for the watch.

We realize how fortunate we are to live where we do and have what we have, but also how much work there is to do. Rather than dwell on the negative, we are hopeful and excited at the prospect of making a difference wherever we can.  Other Ways You Can Help:Like our campaign? GIVE your friends a heads up by sharing this with them by clicking one of the social media buttons up top.As a way to GIVE back to our awesome supporters, we created a referral program!

<p>                                    <strong> Our designs and what makes ours different</strong></p>
<p>Enter, Zombikinis with a whole new take on bikinis, exotics and custom fabric printing. We offer hand made in the U.S.A .products. Featuring artist designed fabrics and prints that will be licensed exclusively to us as well as unique and one of a kind bikinis and exotic dance wear. Using artwork by various artists in combination with our fabric manufacturer to create limited edition designs on high quality stretch fabrics.</p>
<p>We have tested our Zombikinis and exotic wear under some of the worst of conditions to find the best results in durability, longevity, and design.</p>
<p>While all of our tags are clearly marked hand wash only and should be maintained as such.</p>
<p>We have tested them in the washer and dryer repeatedly, pool water, salt water, fresh water, and dance clubs all over. Doing deliberately everything possibly wrong to see what holds up to the test of life. (These little things are tough)</p>
<p>Because the truth is we all buy items, never read the tags or forget that they should be treated as delicates and we do bad things to them.</p>
<p>“Zombikinis are Tag-less” We use waterproof ink to inner stamp all of our items, no more itchy tags, or damaged items from pulling the tags out. No one ever did the beach walk - n - scratch and made it look good, so tags be gone.</p>

<h3>Personality is what defines us as individuals.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506628068/ku8oyadhxikgmytvybb5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We realised through understanding the meaning of colour that we could all express our personality through the colours we align to and that colour meaning correlates directly with personality traits. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508065436/iffrr9gv7y1nvdmdzsg0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have taken this understanding to introduce a men's watch brand that is vibrant &amp; bold into the marketplace, a brand that focuses on delivering high quality, fashionable products that help you make a personality statement. </p>
<h3><strong>Colour plays a vital role in the world we live in</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506608744/jd8ccbilvftaljnfdicx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are launching this campaign on the back of our  <strong><i>VIBRATO Originals</i></strong> colour palette (Blue, Red, White &amp; Yellow) which we feel gives us a great opportunity to tap into a strong set of personalities. <strong><i>Personalities that represent us</i></strong> through the colours we come into contact with on a daily basis. </p>
<h3>Personality is the original personal property.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506635731/atuz9xndpmrgz3qog68s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However we would love to introduce more colour palettes and styles based on our brand ethos and represent the personalities that match. By bringing our Signature Watches directly via Indiegogo we are able to connect to our potential consumers and cut out the retailers and middlemen.  This allows us to have first hand feedback and makes us accountable to only you our customers and also allows us to offer a great quality product for <strong><i>half the price</i></strong> retailers would charge.</p>
<h3>VIBRATO Signature Colourway Two</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507668215/vftj9ofrewshczizv9ln.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Style is a reflection of your attitude and your personality.</h3>

<p>We drew inspiration for our ""Signature Collection"" from the idea that colour accessories can be a great extension to our personalities. This idea of a product that allows you to express yourself in this manner was ambitious at first, but we wanted to take the opportunity to introduce it to market and create quality products, for a fraction of our competitors' prices. We are hopeful that crowdfunding will kickstart a new movement and fund our very first project.</p>
<h3>Our collection is backed by a warranty</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506681057/a87a9f7dq90hiztcgbua.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By working together with a network of experienced manufacturing partners, we have put together a product and brand that we are very proud of and hope you will be too.. From the design to the hardcase snap box packaging that the watch arrives in, every nuance of our Signature Collection has been looked over in detail to ensure that the watches are built to last. </p>
<p>We're confident that your VIBRATO Signature Watch will be durable and stand up to everyday wear. We wanted to keep the case strong and aligned to our vibrant and bold ethos, at <strong>13mm thick</strong> and <strong>47mm</strong> in diameter. To increase durability, we decided on a 316L steel case. This allows for a strong case that is also a perfect weight to the touch.

<h3>Thank You for taking time out to read our story</h3>
</div></div>","First time to Indiegogo?
It's super easy!
1. Decide how many VIBRATO Signature Watches you would like then click the pink button that says, ""GET THIS PERK.""
2. Fill out your shipping information and continue with your payment.
3. Receive and fill out the survey for colour choices via email
4. We receive your colour choices and prepare your watch. 
5. You receive your order and your expression is in your hands :)
 
Personality is what defines us as individuals.

We realised through understanding the meaning of colour that we could all express our personality through the colours we align to and that colour meaning correlates directly with personality traits. 

We have taken this understanding to introduce a men's watch brand that is vibrant & bold into the marketplace, a brand that focuses on delivering high quality, fashionable products that help you make a personality statement. 
Colour plays a vital role in the world we live in

We are launching this campaign on the back of our  VIBRATO Originals colour palette (Blue, Red, White & Yellow) which we feel gives us a great opportunity to tap into a strong set of personalities. Personalities that represent us through the colours we come into contact with on a daily basis. 
Personality is the original personal property.

However we would love to introduce more colour palettes and styles based on our brand ethos and represent the personalities that match. By bringing our Signature Watches directly via Indiegogo we are able to connect to our potential consumers and cut out the retailers and middlemen.  This allows us to have first hand feedback and makes us accountable to only you our customers and also allows us to offer a great quality product for half the price retailers would charge.
VIBRATO Signature Colourway Two

Style is a reflection of your attitude and your personality.

We drew inspiration for our ""Signature Collection"" from the idea that colour accessories can be a great extension to our personalities. This idea of a product that allows you to express yourself in this manner was ambitious at first, but we wanted to take the opportunity to introduce it to market and create quality products, for a fraction of our competitors' prices. We are hopeful that crowdfunding will kickstart a new movement and fund our very first project.
Our collection is backed by a warranty

By working together with a network of experienced manufacturing partners, we have put together a product and brand that we are very proud of and hope you will be too.. From the design to the hardcase snap box packaging that the watch arrives in, every nuance of our Signature Collection has been looked over in detail to ensure that the watches are built to last. 
We're confident that your VIBRATO Signature Watch will be durable and stand up to everyday wear. We wanted to keep the case strong and aligned to our vibrant and bold ethos, at 13mm thick and 47mm in diameter. To increase durability, we decided on a 316L steel case. This allows for a strong case that is also a perfect weight to the touch. It is the industry standard when it comes to luxury watches. 
If anything were to happen to your watch, we hope that you will send it back to us for repair or replacement. We will cover all internal parts should they ever fail you within our 2 year warranty period.

<p>We see a hat industry dominated by cottons, nylon, and straw blends. The hat industry is lacking quality and design. We want to craft a hat that is not only stylish, but made from materials that are actually functional, and<b> last for at least 10 years</b>. We call our strategy 'Sustainable Fashion.'</p>
<p>Most brands these days purposely make goods which are meant to fall apart after a few wears. This process is called <b>Planned obsolescence</b>. This is a business strategy in which the obsolescence (the process of becoming obsolete—that is, unfashionable or no longer usable) of a product is planned and built into it from its conception. This is done so that in future the consumer feels a need to purchase new products and services that the manufacturer brings out as replacements for the old ones.</p>

</div></div>","Our Hats are:1) Made from premium fabric. We use only the highest quality wool twill fabric. This is an extremely superior fabric, used only by top craftsmen. It's 300 grams and designed to have an amazing soft feel but endure the most brutal conditions.2) Backed by a 10 year guarantee. We're confident that your 365 hat will be with the most durable hat you've ever owned. We're so confident that we are backing our hats up with a 10 year guarantee.3) Made in America. Paying attention to details is vital to us, so wanted to be very hands on with the production process. We teamed up with production facilities that pay proper attention to quality, people and procedures right here in New York.4) Sold Directly to you. Kickstarter allows us to cut out the retail channel and offer you a hat that typically would retail for $120 at under $70.




Our journey started almost two years ago when we took a different approach to how hats are made. Our love for quality products led us on a mission to design the perfect hat. In late 2012, we teamed up with a small group craftsmen in Harlem NY, and started selling our goods online. Our designs were noticed and gained popularity due to simple urban design, but we wanted to take it step further.



We see a hat industry dominated by cottons, nylon, and straw blends. The hat industry is lacking quality and design. We want to craft a hat that is not only stylish, but made from materials that are actually functional, and last for at least 10 years. We call our strategy 'Sustainable Fashion.'
Most brands these days purposely make goods which are meant to fall apart after a few wears. This process is called Planned obsolescence. This is a business strategy in which the obsolescence (the process of becoming obsolete—that is, unfashionable or no longer usable) of a product is planned and built into it from its conception. This is done so that in future the consumer feels a need to purchase new products and services that the manufacturer brings out as replacements for the old ones.

After searching through hundreds of textiles combinations, we chose an incredible wool material which is light weight yet durable. Functionality was key, and we found the perfect textile to compliment the life of an outdoor fanatic. With your early support today, we'll use the funds to begin the production of the 365 hat collection.


The 365 hat is not only perfection in terms of engineering and production, but it's rich in its concept and quality. Unlike most other hats on the market, the 365 hat can sustain the sun, snow, and any weather in between. We wanted the design to be simple and classic, so we stripped the hat down to it's bare essentials.

The 365 is heat processed from a textile which always retains its shape. The hat can be stuffed into your bag without a worry. The hat will look exactly as it did when you're ready to wear it again.


To create a quality product, we chose a durable wool fabric. This innovative fabric is treated to retain it's shape for the life of the hat, which gives added versatility. The hat is waterproof, as well as sweat & stain resistant. We worked with Bollman Hat company in NYC, a staple in the hat industry for 145 years, to provide us with the top quality wool available in the United States. Our simple design is finished off with adjustable leather drawstrings. 


Detachable ear protectors
Ideal for those frigid days when your ears feel frozen. The 365 features a Velcro strip which is compatible with the detachable ear protectors. You can easily attached or remove the ear protectors depending on the season.



We wanted a design that could be flexible to your individual style, so we developed 3 color options to choose from:
The Veneto is a classic design ideal for outdoor enthusiast. The Veneto featured a heat processed brim with no additional stitching, light-weight leather drawstrings, and small ventilation holes near the brim. This is a simple design which speaks volumes. Available in Red, Brown & Black



Brown color shown above in shade and natural lighting


Made for the fashion forward explorer. Dress up, or dress down with the Manila hat. Features light-weight lambskin drawstrings, and a double enforced stitching on the brim and ventilation holes near the brim. Pair this hat perfectly with your favorite Fall jacket, and look fresh on your next adventure. Available in Red, Brown & Black



Red color shown above in shade and natural lighting


This is the perfect hat to pair up with just about any outfit. Not only is the Riyadh functional, but it will add personality to your everyday outfit. The simple design is contrasted beautifully with the heavy leather drawstrings. Features double enforced brim stitching, and ventilation for cooling. This hat demands attention without asking for it. Available in Red, Brown & Black


Black color shown above in shade and natural lighting


Place a measuring tape around your head about 1/8"" above your ear, across the mid-forehead, completely circling your head. Hold the tape firmly, but not too tightly. You need to measure your head exactly where the hat will sit. If your measurement falls between sizes, choose the next largest size. Typically, an average man will wear a Large, and a majority women wear Small.






Our team has spent nearly 10 months perfecting the 365 hat, and tested its functionality through various weather conditions. This has become more than a passion, but rather a mission to bring quality goods back to hard working people. We want to make sure outdoor fanatics like us never have to get soaked in the rain, or sunburn in the heat. If for any reason you are not satisfied with the quality of your 365 hat, we'll replace the hat for you. If the hat gets damaged due to the weather or looses it's shape.. we will be more than happy to replace the hat for you! We're putting 10 year stamp on that.

cost price by the time it arrives in the store. This is attributable to having business activities in between such as a middleman, retail stores etc. Ultimately, this drives their profit margins sky high and leaves a hole in the pockets of consumers.

<p>I am
a 19 year old student, eager entrepreneur, and fellow watch enthusiast. I
started falling in love with watches after taking notice of the many watches my
dad collected. He would line them up neatly on his bedside table, which
have intrigued me about their origins and designs.And from a young age, I
always knew I wanted work with watches in the future, which eventually became a
life long ambition. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The
thought of low-quality, unreliable, and costly watches being
released into the market made me upset. The quality on most of these watches is
sub-par at best, most having low build quality, causing them to feel
cheap and fragile.</p>
<p></p>
<p> This made me have a sudden realization: What
better way to share my passion with others, than to start my own brand of
affordable, stylish and durable watches?</p>
<p></p>
<p>This
led to the creation of SHIBUSA, providing a watch that is versatile, and
affordable, all without compromising on the quality and solid feel of a finely
made watch.</p>
<p>Who knows? This might be the first step for me, and I want you to be a part of it.</p>

</div></div>","No sub-standard quality watches from us! We ensure quality by using the most durable and sought after materials in the watch industry, some of which are used by big player watch companies. We also use components by renown companies like Citizen Miyota to ensure quality. To add on to the strict quality control checks that will be carried out after production, I will personally do checks one-by-one to ensure that the watch(es) you receive are of unparalleled quality. No cracks, no scratches, no fuss.Our mineral crystal is
specially hardened to prevent scratches  and treated with an anti-reflective
coating
which reduces glare and dirt marks, ensuring your watch stays clean and easy to
read. Your SHIBUSA watch will never give off a blurred,dirty look that most other mineral crystal watches show.                                                   Scratch-free all day, keeping it fresh.We use PVD Coated 316L Stainless Steel commonly found in many luxury watches. It is robust and durable, and does not rust, making it the benchmark material for all steel watches.Why PVD Coated?PVD Coating, or sometimes also known as ION plating can make a watch resistant to scratches due to its ability in reducing friction on metal parts. It not only makes the watch look aesthetically pleasing, but also keeps your watch in mint condition. In the event of a knock or scratch from another object, you can be assured that your SHIBUSA watch is more likely to take the paint off another object, than have its own paint scratched off!                              Going for a swim? No problem.Our watches are water resistant up to a 5 ATM. Good for showering and snorkeling, but it is probably not a good idea to deep sea dive with it.Japanese Perfection.Citizen Miyota is a Japanese company well-known for being the engine of many watches around the globe. The Japanese have a reputation for craftsmanship, precision, and attention to detail. We only seek the best components with superior
quality, thus selecting the Miyota 0S21 Chronograph Quartz movement was only
natural to ensure perfection in every watch.For the best comfort!Our straps are made of 100% Genuine leather which seasons over time as you wear it, but
never loses its classic look and feel. Which is unlike most leather straps in
the watch industry that are made of short-lived synthetic materials.                                                    43mm Case Diameter                                                    11mm Case Thickness                                                         24mm Lug Width                  Isamashi No.1 Blackout (BO1)$119 USD + Free Shipping WorldwideExpected future price: $150 USD*Please comment the perk code & strap you want after purchase*

Here's the HARD TRUTH; Most watch brands mark their prices upwards by 5-15X their
cost price by the time it arrives in the store. This is attributable to having business activities in between such as a middleman, retail stores etc. Ultimately, this drives their profit margins sky high and leaves a hole in the pockets of consumers. Also, where is the quality you are getting for the price you pay?                                                                         

We aim to be affordable, all without compromising on the high-quality a watch should have. This is why we sell our watches straight to the consumer, which means we cut the need of having operations in-between that create a bigger hole in your pocket.We aim to reduce or totally eradicate opacity many businesses have to ensure
that our customers will never have doubts about their purchase.


SHIBUSA in Japanese: Simple, Subtle, and Unobstructed beauty.
A mix of class with a twist of modern day street fashion, conveyed on your wrist. Hence our motto: “Tell the time, Make a statement."" 

                          
Our watches are versatile, sleek and unique, allowing it to be worn in any setting. 






I am
a 19 year old student, eager entrepreneur, and fellow watch enthusiast. I
started falling in love with watches after taking notice of the many watches my
dad collected. He would line them up neatly on his bedside table, which
have intrigued me about their origins and designs.And from a young age, I
always knew I wanted work with watches in the future, which eventually became a
life long ambition. 

The
thought of low-quality, unreliable, and costly watches being
released into the market made me upset. The quality on most of these watches is
sub-par at best, most having low build quality, causing them to feel
cheap and fragile.

 This made me have a sudden realization: What
better way to share my passion with others, than to start my own brand of
affordable, stylish and durable watches?

This
led to the creation of SHIBUSA, providing a watch that is versatile, and
affordable, all without compromising on the quality and solid feel of a finely
made watch.
Who knows? This might be the first step for me, and I want you to be a part of it.

<h3>Team Line-up</h3>
<p>In 2017, we gathered to start this amazing project. 3 football enthusiasts, supporting different colours but sharing the same emotion. Football is apart of our lives 24/7. We went through joy and disappointments, we laughed and we cried, we were victorious and we were defeated, but in the end the feeling is always there. And this can not go unnoticed. Because we know that there are billions like us. That enjoy a brilliant goal, a stunning pass ou a mind blowing dribble. And we want to seize that moment and remember it forever. That's how Playmaker Clothing was idealized, and later on created. Meet the team: </p>

<p>Our first goal is without a doubt to launch our business. For that, we need to get this campaign on track so we can put our first tees out. We want to have cool and unique designs that every football fan will love to wear. We are aiming for a global market. Football is a worldwide sport with billions of fans. We created this clothing brand because we feel that there is a huge opportunity in this market and a real need among enthusiasts. When it comes to football-related wearables, other than the official club merchandises, there aren't other casual options. We believe that football fans deserve to be able to express their passion every day. And for that, <strong>Playmaker Clothing</strong> was created. </p>

</div></div>","What's our GOAL? 

We want to give football fans around the world a way to proudly express their passion, which, unless you buy your team's merchandise, is almost impossible to find. It is not just about the team we support, it is about the game itself.
Our products are meant to celebrate unforgettable happenings in the history of this sport. For that, we created Playmaker, a clothing brand that combines great quality and environmentally friendly products, with great players, teams and memorable moments in football history.
Our goal is to give the world a way to proudly wear their passion for the game and to deliver the emotion of a late winner in each and every one of our products.

Our Tactics
Okay guys, let's get to the point. Right now we have a collection of designs, divided into 4 different categories: Legends, Historic Moments, Famous Quotes and Branding.
We are launching with 6 designs, even though we have more. We were able to get a reliable supplier, from whom we ordered our first samples. After developing our products, we are now at a point where we need our first orders to get things going. Right now we need 10,000€ so that we can order our first shipment from the supplier, build our online store, and face our market. So, as our brand ambassadors, you are now our playmakers. If you want to be part of the team, help us, and we will work harder every day to make this dream come true. So, are you our number 10?

        
 
Are we Fair Players? Obviously! 

Here are our secret weapons:
- 100% organic cotton, grown using methods and materials that have a low impact on the environment (fair-trade cotton)
- Water-based ink for the printing, free of plastics and PVC, which makes it also eco-friendly
- All printed information, no itchy tags on the t-shirts
- Ecological cardboard packing for shipment. 
Our suppliers were picked based on these specific attributes, ensuring that all the manufacturing processes are done in LEED certified factories. So when you buy our tees, you can be sure that you have the best product in your hands. We know the importance of preserving the world we live in, and as real playmakers, we will try our best to do so. We want to win, but in the end, we want to do in a classy and harmless way. 

So are you fit to wear the shirt?
We are not doubting that you have what it takes. Now you just need to know how big you are. Here you have a little help:

<p><b>✨</b><i><b>We are honest , you can ask first through email if we have your size and color available, and if it is in stock then you can get the perk, if it is not so , we shall put  your order as pending, and we will notify you when it is ready, So then you can get the perk. Other option,,,, you can contribute and if your size or color are not available , you can wait until manufacturing it</b> .<i><strong>We will update   production status </strong></i></i><strong><i><i>permanently</i></i>✨</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>MEASURE OUR FEET TO FIND OUT OUR SIZE</strong></u></h3>
<p><u><strong> Measure the feet with the sock you normally wear, or without socks if you do not wear them, but always you have to measure at  THE END OF THE DAY  when THE FOOT IS EXPANDED or  WHEN you have had activity,( WALK A LONG TIME, CLIMB STAIRS...)   </strong></u><strong>because feet  expand throughout the day and with physical activity . </strong></p>
<p><strong>        If you measure feet EARLY IN THE MORNING you may get UNRELIABLE RESULTS .</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>¿ HOW DOES YOU MEASURE YOUR FEET ?</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>1-<u>The heel is supported in wall</u>        2- <u>your position must be straight completely</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>3- Put a paper sheet under your feet and it must be support in the wall exactly (picture 1 )</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>4- The heel should not be very crushed or pressed against the wall, only touching the wall slightly  ¡ VERY IMPORTANT !</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>5- Trace the outline of your foot , with the pencil perpendicular to the floor (picture 2 ) , IT IS BETTER IF SOMEONE HELPS YOU</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>drawing a line parallel to the wall that passes through the longest point of your foot ( it can be  BIG TOE  or INDEX TOE,  see picture  4).</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>6- you must measure both feet and choose the longest</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>7- Let´s MEASURE from line that passes through the longest point of big toe to line that passes through longest point of the heel . The RULER must have 90º an angle with those lines.​ </strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>So you are being precise</strong></u></p>

<p> </p>
<p> I shall always be grateful with any kind of help from a greater contribution to a minor, because everything costs effort to get it, but I also appreciate that you share my brand, my website <strong>(<a href=""https://setnika.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://setnika.com</a>)</strong>, follow me on facebook or instagram and share, if you want to see the nine colors of the models click in this link -<strong><a href=""https://setnika.com/tienda-online-moda-etnica/zapatillas-estilo-tribal-etnico-urbano/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://setnika.com/tienda-online-moda-etnica/zapatillas-estilo-tribal-etnico-urbano/</a></strong></p>
<p>-it's a way to help me too.</p>
<p><strong>You can also use the tools of this platform to SHARE</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to finish with a phrase that I like very much:</p>
<p>""EVERYTHING YOU DO FOR SOMEONE NOW, SOME DAY, SOMEBODY WILL DO FOR YOU WHAT YOU NEED</p>
<h3><strong>¿ Who am I and what does  my brand SETNIKA represent ?</strong></h3>
</div>
<p>My name is JUAN JOSÉ, I'm from a small town called Nava de Abajo in the province of ALBACETE. I am a dreamer as you can be it , and I make an efforts to achieve my dreams with  determination, because there is no other way.</p>
<p>I am the creator of the brand of SNEAKERS - SETNIKA, with a peculiar style, for boys and girls of receptive and dared mentality who like to wear a different point and mark trend .</p>
<p>We distinguish ourselves by using LIVE and INTENSIVE colors and some more classic, total a range of 9 colors, which will delight the dared.</p>
<p>With your help, in this first phase I want to check the public acceptance of my brand and product and thus be able to set new goals.</p>
<p> WHAT DO YOU THINK ? .MY MOST SINCERE gratitude ONLY WITH YOUR INTEREST, whether you contribute or not.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>What I need and what get those who contribute</h3>
<p><br/>What I intend in this first phase after creating the brand, is to see the acceptance of my brand and product, and the degree of satisfaction of the public.</p>
<p>The money obtained with the contributions will be used to support the small business that I have as an entrepreneur and make new orders if there are.</p>
<p>What do you get?</p>
<p>What you get is a quality product, comfortable and durable, of a GREAT BEAUTY, DIVERSITY AND COLORFUL,  you can give yourself different looks from a casual -urban style  to a more formal and elegant, always marking trends and being dared.</p>
<h3><strong>SOCIAL IMPACT (DECENT EMPLOYMENT )</strong></h3>
<p><br/> WORTHY EMPLOYMENT of all workers who sew, cut and paste these shoes, they earn decent wages and work 8 hours with their vacations and their social security, we do not believe in a fashion industry that lowers prices with THE COST OF  HUMAN RIGHTS.</p>
<p>""<i><strong>IF YOU PURCHASE SOMETHING  very CHEAP, IN REALITY IT IS NOT SO , SOMEONE IN ASIA, OR ANOTHER COUNTRY IS PAYING YOU WITH HIS REDUCTION OF RIGHTS AND SEMI-SLAVERY , SOMETIMES WITHOUT SEMI""</strong></i></p>
<p>The contributions are important because they would allow me to sustain the business, which is in a very primitive state, and little by little with contributions I can mark new goals. I hope this business goes ahead because I would like to make a lot of very new designs that I have in mind.</p>
<p>Very important for me if the business goes ahead is to contribute to social causes such as making a foundation for the education of children, but it is very far away is only an aspiration.</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>I want to realize my dream, and I know that the risks are many, and the challenges too, I shall make  my best efforts because I want to see my brand and my product succeed, but none will be able to say that I did not try  work very hard and I gave  all my efforts, A lot of time and I do not see the light, but I imagine that it is somewhere and I walk towards it, maybe I find it maybe not, but I walk and I try to go towards it.</p>
<p>""ALWAYS WHEN YOU START ANYTHING, IF YOU ARE NOT ONLY, YOU HAVE MANY BALLOTS THAT YOUR ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS A SUCCESS, THE ACCOMPANIED PATH IS BETTER""</p>
<p>I'm in an initial phase but my next challenges would be to launch my brand and publicize it, expand it, and enter other markets like the rest of Europe and World, and of course create a lot of more models, very creative and desired ... But that is far away, I must climb the first step of the ladder first ....</p>

<h2><strong>✨CLEANLINESS OF SNEAKERS, and REMOVING THE BAD SMELL.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>¿ CAN WE WASH OUR SNEAKERS IN THE WASHING MACHINE ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The most of sneakers are not ready to put in the washing machine. Adhesives and the materials with which they are made can deteriorate or even  to detach the sole of the sneakers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MANUAL CLEANING OF THE SNEAKERS.</strong></p>
<p>You just need:</p>
<p>-<strong>A soft bristle brush, can be BRUSH of teeth or nails,</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Neutral soap and a sponge or cloth.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To clean the sneakers, we will make a mixture with warm water and neutral soap, and apply it with the sponge or cloth .. In areas that are dirtier, we will put more emphasis to remove them. With neutral soap and warm water. Simply wash your sneakers (without submerging them) very dirty with water with neutral soap.</p>
<p>With another sponge clean and moistened with warm water, we will remove the excess soap that has been left in the sneakers. Let it to dry with air , without any source of heat nearby , nor directly to the sun, Nor  use of dryers. If there is any stain left, you can repeat these steps again. But never use bleach that can spoil the sneakers.</p>
<p>If after washing, some stains persist, you can ADD BICARBONATE to the water and soap and to rub again, you add bicarbonate until results are seen,  you do not add much the first time (a teaspoon of coffee would be fine as a start.</p>
<p>- To Remove the rests of soap from the sneakers, we will pass a damp cloth throughout the sneaker until there is no soap or dirt left.</p>
<p>- Before letting them dry, put some paper inside each sneaker to absorb moisture and not deform the sneaker.</p>
<p><strong>CLEANING OF THE AREAS OF COW FUR.</strong></p>
<p>Our sneakers are combined with  zones of COW FUR (in the area of ​​the laces and the heel).</p>
<p>In this area we will apply ammonia and vinegar depending on whether the color is dark or light, but only if there have been difficult spots, if not, remember:</p>
<p><strong>WARM WATER + NEUTRAL SOAP + TO RUB WITH TOOTHBRUSH + TO REMOVE THE  SOAP WITH ANOTHER  DIFFERENT DAMP CLOTH.</strong></p>
<p>1 - First we will remove the dirt with the soft bristle brush.</p>
<p>1-1 For those difficult spots that have remained on the sneakers, we will apply a mixture of warm water with ammonia and neutral soap if the color of the cow fur is clear and brushing in favor of the hair.  With ammonia and neutral soap (with light colors) An excellent product to remove stains, without bleaching .</p>
<p>For grease spots.</p>
<p>Dilute <strong>AMMONIA</strong> in a little water.</p>
<p>(a teaspoon of ammonia (5ml), in 2 liters of warm water) .Add 10 ml of neutral soap . Take a brush and moisten it in the mixture of ammonia and neutral soap.</p>
<p>Brush the stain. Remember to do it in the direction of the hair. What should you do? Use the brush to remove the first layer of dust and accumulated dirt, inside and outside the sneaker.</p>
<p>Then dilute a teaspoon of ammonia in the two liters of warm water and add also the neutral soap.</p>
<p>1-2 With <strong>VINEGAR</strong> if the color is dark, with the same brush in favor of the hair. Remove the rest of the mixture with the dampened brush in warm water and let them to dry with air.</p>
<p>When they dry, brushing again. With vinegar (dark colors) Wet a clean cloth or sponge with vinegar. Rub on the stain. Remember to do it in the direction of the hair.</p>
<p><strong>For oil or grease stains, apply a bit of SODIUM BICARBONATE or TALCUM POWDER on the stain, and leave it on overnight. OIL OR FAT SPOTS ----- APPLY BICARBONATE POWDER ON STAIN AND LEAVE ALL NIGHT ACT.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>REMOVING OF THE BAD SMELLS IN SNEAKERS.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With <strong>SODIUM BICARBONATE .</strong></p>
<p>If your SNEAKERS smell bad, you should clean them inside. To do this, it is best to use sodium bicarbonate. Sprinkle the sodium bicarbonate  inside in your smelly shoes and let it act for at least 12 hours.</p>
<p>Then remove the bicarbonate. It is sold in supermarkets or hardware store at € 1-1.5 / kg</p>
<p> Inside with<strong> ALCOHOL</strong> .</p>
<p>Another way to clean and disinfect your shoes inside is with a vaporizer with alcohol. Let the powdered alcohol inside  of the shoe evaporate completely in all corners, before using your shoes again.</p>

MEASURE OUR FEET TO FIND OUT OUR SIZE
 Measure the feet with the sock you normally wear, or without socks if you do not wear them, but always you have to measure at  THE END OF THE DAY  when THE FOOT IS EXPANDED or  WHEN you have had activity,( WALK A LONG TIME, CLIMB STAIRS...)   because feet  expand throughout the day and with physical activity . 
        If you measure feet EARLY IN THE MORNING you may get UNRELIABLE RESULTS .
 
¿ HOW DOES YOU MEASURE YOUR FEET ?
 
1-The heel is supported in wall        2- your position must be straight completely
3- Put a paper sheet under your feet and it must be support in the wall exactly (picture 1 )
4- The heel should not be very crushed or pressed against the wall, only touching the wall slightly  ¡ VERY IMPORTANT !
5- Trace the outline of your foot , with the pencil perpendicular to the floor (picture 2 ) , IT IS BETTER IF SOMEONE HELPS YOU
drawing a line parallel to the wall that passes through the longest point of your foot ( it can be  BIG TOE  or INDEX TOE,  see picture  4).
6- you must measure both feet and choose the longest
7- Let´s MEASURE from line that passes through the longest point of big toe to line that passes through longest point of the heel . The RULER must have 90º an angle with those lines.​ 
So you are being precise

Remember,you have to measure your foot with the sock you use frequently, or without it, if you don't use socks
 
 

 
Picture 9
MEASURING THE LENGTH OF THE FOOT 
 

 
PICTURE   7

PICTURE 8
MEASURING THE FOOT WIDTH WITH AN INSOLE OF YOUR SNEAKERS
 

 
PENCIL POSITION
If you do not place the pencil in the correct position the size will be wrong, please be careful.
You must consider that if you place the crooked pencil  ,  a variation of 3,3 milimeters   is very easy and that variation is half size less or more  and you can feel tight your foot or a little loose .
Therefore be careful and precise​.

AN EXAMPLE 
( LENGTH in CM ( with your normal socks   )  + 1,5 CENTIMETRES ) X  1,5 =   your SIZE
23,5 centimetres length of my foot with my normal socks   + 1,5 cm = 25 ctms
25 centimetres X 1,5 = 37,50 EUROPEAN SIZE 
We recommend 38 size
 
GUIDE OF SIZES
( FOOT LENGTH     +      1,5 CM )  x   1 ,5         =             SIZE
If you don´t use socks , you  must measure without socks
Remember these sneakers are  CASUAL STYLE SNEAKERS for wearing , walking , working , some event,partying, shining .. .and for whatever you want.......but if you are going to do sports with certain degree of intensity frequently, you must tell  us it.)
                        FOOT LENGTH + 1,5 CM===YOUR SIZE ===>> FOOT WIDTH
                
                        23,16  + 1,5     =   24,66 centimetres     =  37  SIZE       86,30  mm width
                           23,83 + 1,5     =   25,33 centimetres      =  38 SIZE        87,40  mm width
                        24,50  + 1,5     =   26,00 centimetres     =  39 SIZE        88,40 mm width
                        25,16  + 1,5     =   26,66 centimetres     =   40 SIZE       90,40 mm width
                        25,83  + 1,5     =  27,33 centimetres      =    41 SIZE       92,70  mm width
                        26,5    + 1,5     =  28,0 centimetres        =    42 SIZE      94,80  mm width
                        27,16   + 1,5     =  28,66 centimetres      =    43 SIZE      95,54  mm width
                        27,83  + 1,5     =  29,33 centimetres       =    44 SIZE      98,26  mm width
                        28,50  +  1,5    =   30,00 centimetres     =    45 SIZE      99,70  mm width

What I intend in this first phase after creating the brand, is to see the acceptance of my brand and product, and the degree of satisfaction of the public.
The money obtained with the contributions will be used to support the small business that I have as an entrepreneur and make new orders if there are.
What do you get?
What you get is a quality product, comfortable and durable, of a GREAT BEAUTY, DIVERSITY AND COLORFUL,  you can give yourself different looks from a casual -urban style  to a more formal and elegant, always marking trends and being dared.
SOCIAL IMPACT (DECENT EMPLOYMENT )
 WORTHY EMPLOYMENT of all workers who sew, cut and paste these shoes, they earn decent wages and work 8 hours with their vacations and their social security, we do not believe in a fashion industry that lowers prices with THE COST OF  HUMAN RIGHTS.
""IF YOU PURCHASE SOMETHING  very CHEAP, IN REALITY IT IS NOT SO , SOMEONE IN ASIA, OR ANOTHER COUNTRY IS PAYING YOU WITH HIS REDUCTION OF RIGHTS AND SEMI-SLAVERY , SOMETIMES WITHOUT SEMI""
The contributions are important because they would allow me to sustain the business, which is in a very primitive state, and little by little with contributions I can mark new goals. I hope this business goes ahead because I would like to make a lot of very new designs that I have in mind.
Very important for me if the business goes ahead is to contribute to social causes such as making a foundation for the education of children, but it is very far away is only an aspiration.
Risks and Challenges
I want to realize my dream, and I know that the risks are many, and the challenges too, I shall make  my best efforts because I want to see my brand and my product succeed, but none will be able to say that I did not try  work very hard and I gave  all my efforts, A lot of time and I do not see the light, but I imagine that it is somewhere and I walk towards it, maybe I find it maybe not, but I walk and I try to go towards it.
""ALWAYS WHEN YOU START ANYTHING, IF YOU ARE NOT ONLY, YOU HAVE MANY BALLOTS THAT YOUR ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS A SUCCESS, THE ACCOMPANIED PATH IS BETTER""
I'm in an initial phase but my next challenges would be to launch my brand and publicize it, expand it, and enter other markets like the rest of Europe and World, and of course create a lot of more models, very creative and desired ... But that is far away, I must climb the first step of the ladder first ....

With neutral soap and warm water. Simply wash your sneakers (without submerging them) very dirty with water with neutral soap.

Let it to dry with air , without any source of heat nearby , nor directly to the sun, Nor  use of dryers. If there is any stain left, you can repeat these steps again. But never use bleach that can spoil the sneakers.
If after washing, some stains persist, you can ADD BICARBONATE to the water and soap and to rub again, you add bicarbonate until results are seen,  you do not add much the first time (a teaspoon of coffee would be fine as a start.
- To Remove the rests of soap from the sneakers, we will pass a damp cloth throughout the sneaker until there is no soap or dirt left.
- Before letting them dry, put some paper inside each sneaker to absorb moisture and not deform the sneaker.
CLEANING OF THE AREAS OF COW FUR.
Our sneakers are combined with  zones of COW FUR (in the area of ​​the laces and the heel).
In this area we will apply ammonia and vinegar depending on whether the color is dark or light, but only if there have been difficult spots, if not, remember:
WARM WATER + NEUTRAL SOAP + TO RUB WITH TOOTHBRUSH + TO REMOVE THE  SOAP WITH ANOTHER  DIFFERENT DAMP CLOTH.

Brush the stain. Remember to do it in the direction of the hair. What should you do? Use the brush to remove the first layer of dust and accumulated dirt, inside and outside the sneaker.
Then dilute a teaspoon of ammonia in the two liters of warm water and add also the neutral soap.

<p>We all have heavy responsibilities weighing down on us every single day. Having lunch at times becomes a 'to do' because we just don't have the time unfortunately. With a combination of work,family and friends, life just becomes overwhelming. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not to mention our 5 time obligatory praying needs. This is something we cannot falter on my dear brother's and sister's, since it is mandatory. It's a lot to take on for anybody. I myself had a difficult time juggling it all. I work from 9-4, then usually go do my daily grocery run on my way home. Then arrive home and do some prep work, eat dinner with the family, watch some television and by the time I get up to get my mother's evening milk... its 10:30pm (where does the time go)? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I fell asleep one night thinking how busy life had become and to be honest I was missing a few prayers on a daily basis. I felt weak, and numb inside (honest to god truth) from praying five times daily. I automatically went to three and praying the missed two before heading off to bed almost every day. My body was telling me to get back on track but my mind was boggled down with all my responsibilities that I was just unable to do so. With that heavy weight resting on my chest, I fell asleep asking that night asking the LORD for guidance.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Upon waking up the next morning, I came up with an idea. This idea drove me to other ideas and here I'm here asking for your approval as well as your backing. It's something I truly believe in and I am very passionate about. I use this device to keep myself from missing any more prayers. It's comfortable and trendy, and does what it is suppose to do. It notifies me through my body. A vibration sequence travels through my arm, regardless of what I am doing and allows me to organize my time more efficiently. Furthermore, I take the few minutes necessary and complete my prayers, which for me is my #1 priority. I feel like someone else when I don't perform my obligations (similar to that snickers commercial:) I feel hollow and alone and when I bend down to ask for forgiveness I feel whole again. I'm hoping you all feel the same. Support Deen&amp;Dunya and talk about it amongst your peers, colleagues and family members and make this a household name. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Teach your children the value of prayer. My son wears it and notifies me as soon as it starts to vibrate on his arm and then joins me in prayer.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> It has a compass embedded within the bracelet to let you know the direction in which you should be facing. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The icons light up, depending on which prayer it is when it vibrates. Just to make things a little easier. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> It is great for elders, who have a hard time hearing. This device has zero sound. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Very important to have for people who are constantly busy, and need the reminder. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> Great for someone who is around noise all the time. The vibration will always notify you throughout this chaos. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> The band will be adjustable for all ages and wrist sizes. </li></ul>

</div></div>","We all have heavy responsibilities weighing down on us every single day. Having lunch at times becomes a 'to do' because we just don't have the time unfortunately. With a combination of work,family and friends, life just becomes overwhelming. 
 
Not to mention our 5 time obligatory praying needs. This is something we cannot falter on my dear brother's and sister's, since it is mandatory. It's a lot to take on for anybody. I myself had a difficult time juggling it all. I work from 9-4, then usually go do my daily grocery run on my way home. Then arrive home and do some prep work, eat dinner with the family, watch some television and by the time I get up to get my mother's evening milk... its 10:30pm (where does the time go)? 
 
I fell asleep one night thinking how busy life had become and to be honest I was missing a few prayers on a daily basis. I felt weak, and numb inside (honest to god truth) from praying five times daily. I automatically went to three and praying the missed two before heading off to bed almost every day. My body was telling me to get back on track but my mind was boggled down with all my responsibilities that I was just unable to do so. With that heavy weight resting on my chest, I fell asleep asking that night asking the LORD for guidance.  
 
Upon waking up the next morning, I came up with an idea. This idea drove me to other ideas and here I'm here asking for your approval as well as your backing. It's something I truly believe in and I am very passionate about. I use this device to keep myself from missing any more prayers. It's comfortable and trendy, and does what it is suppose to do. It notifies me through my body. A vibration sequence travels through my arm, regardless of what I am doing and allows me to organize my time more efficiently. Furthermore, I take the few minutes necessary and complete my prayers, which for me is my #1 priority. I feel like someone else when I don't perform my obligations (similar to that snickers commercial:) I feel hollow and alone and when I bend down to ask for forgiveness I feel whole again. I'm hoping you all feel the same. Support Deen&Dunya and talk about it amongst your peers, colleagues and family members and make this a household name. 
 
Teach your children the value of prayer. My son wears it and notifies me as soon as it starts to vibrate on his arm and then joins me in prayer.
 
 It has a compass embedded within the bracelet to let you know the direction in which you should be facing. 
 
The icons light up, depending on which prayer it is when it vibrates. Just to make things a little easier. 
 
 It is great for elders, who have a hard time hearing. This device has zero sound. 
 
Very important to have for people who are constantly busy, and need the reminder. 
 
 Great for someone who is around noise all the time. The vibration will always notify you throughout this chaos. 
 
 The band will be adjustable for all ages and wrist sizes. 
 
 The design is unisex, and will benefit everyone. 

 
Deen & Dunya will be associated with an application. All you have to do is put in the Country code you reside in and let D&D do its job. It will notify you on a day to day basis. It is a must have if your looking to aim high and strive to be the best in God's eyes as well as everyone else's. Amen.

That’s it.Up Front and Fabulous Limited was founded by Lucinda Kowol, Bridget Townsend and Giles Tilley. Three women with a host of business experience between them who are determined to give bra wearers a better choice.Why Front Fastening Bras?We think the real question is -Why back fastening bras?The 2 surveys (Populous) we commissioned showed us that:Half of us already do our bra up in front, swivelling it around to get it on. Not only does it chafe, but all that pulling and stretching decreases the life of the bra.The other half contort our arms into a back arm lock every morning, felons all for the crime of bra wearing.  There is enough discussion on the putting on of bras to warrant 58 million results on a Google search. Over a million are “How to” videos.Come on, should we really need this much help? We wear bras all day, every day and it’s high time they were made to suit us. It’s 2020, not 1920! We women are good at putting up with stuff that we use or deal with every day that’s not really designed for us. It's time for change.So, what do we want?Two-thirds of the women we surveyed said they want to buy front fastening bras but believe they don’t exist.  75% said they were unhappy with current sizing. Our survey revealed that fit and comfort are women’s top priority followed by look and style.  What does this mean?We can’t just make the same old back-fastening designs with a front closure. We have to be creative, innovative and test, test, test. Up Front & Fabulous bras all have
Fabulous front-fastenings
Fabulous fit
Fabulous feel
A few facts for you:
We are female founded and led.  
We use high-quality fabrics and finishes and make every effort to ensure they ethically sourced. 
Our 1st collection will include underwired and non-wired bras for everyday through to special occasion wear. 
We are developing innovative fasteners and design features to improve fit and comfort without detracting from style. Our bras are up front and fabulous.
Our initial size range covers band sizes 32 to 40 and cup sizes A to E. We are developing better sizing and will expand our size range progressively.
Our bras will be made in Casablanca in a workshop which has a school attached to help young women in the region gain skills and employment. They are very well-established with an impressive list of lingerie clients so we are more than pleased that they have chosen to work with a start-up like ours. 
We will only be selling online at upfrontandfabulous.com. No third parties to deal with, no buck passing, just us. We will let you know when the site is live.
We are based in the UK, near Oxford. We will be shipping internationally. 
 Where will your money go?A big chunk will buy all our fabric, lace, fasteners and accessories. When you are the new kid on the block you have to pay upfront. (well, we had to say it once...)Another big chunk will go to manufacturing.Design and sizing development will use a fair amount too.And finally, we will be able to finish our Shopify website so that we can launch.What do you get for helping us? First - Thank you for donations of any amount. It means everything to us. We can’t do this without you. For all donations up to £120 we have a special range of discount vouchers for purchasing from our 1st collection.  We have designed a fabulous Limited Edition bra and knicker set to say thank you, thank you, thank you for donations of £120 and up! The Limited Edition design has a vintage echo in 2 beautiful contrasting shades of teal blue pure silk with a touch of elastane for a smooth fit.Numbers are limited, so claim yours soon! What have we done so far?We created Up Front & Fabulous Limited in October 2015 and finally had the time to start our business planning, design and development in  2017.  Since then, we've raised some friends and family funding which has got us this far, researched the industry, produced our business plans, designed made and tested a number of prototypes, found our suppliers and manufacturing partners and discovered Indiegogo.Who are we?Oh, and we all wear bras. We may be female founders of a certain age but we put our years of business and personal experience to good use.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>HOW IT STARTED</b></span></p>
<p>My name is Anjana. I hold an MBA degree in marketing and began my career as a webmaster. Many of my clients were jewelers. While creating their web presence jewelry just grew on me. I realised I have found my true calling where I could exploit my creativity to the hilt and create 'real' and lasting pieces for people and families to cherish. There was a lot to learn and I had no coach. It took many years of learning bit by bit and a course in jewelry manufacture where I learnt to make jewelry by my own hand ( soldering, sawing, wire drawing, plate making, annealing, filing, polishing and the works).</p>
<p>Eventually, in 2005 my jewelry business came into existence. By 2007 my business was formally registered, I registered for my export licence too and set up my own handmade jewelry workshop where we made custom jewelry pieces by hand.</p>
<p>We got our own jewelry brand name ""MOAH"" registered soon after. </p>
<p><b>WHY WE REQUIRE FUNDING</b></p>
<p>We got hit by the global recession of 2008. I tried to sustain my workshop but could manage for only a few months. My fledgling enterprise suffered a big blow. </p>
<p>I began outsourcing the actual making of my designs to some outside manufacturing units whom I could trust. But I could not unleash my creativity anymore the way I did earlier with my own workshop. It became very limiting for me. Also, there were no economies of scale. The costing of my jewelry was not as comfortable anymore thereby impacting my sales adversely. </p>
<p>Indian economy took some time to revive. The golden days are not back yet. But things are looking up.</p>
<p>At this juncture I really feel <b>its time to set up my own blissful workshop again</b>. With online selling structures in place I can really, truly make use of both my skills to create unique and beautiful designs, and to make them available across the world. This time round I would also like to add some good state-of-the art machinery to the workshop.</p>
<p><b>YOUR SUPPORT IS HUMBLY REQUESTED</b></p>
<p>I do request for your support. I cannot manage this on my own. I have put up a Jewelry Collection as a reward for your support. These are all original MOAH jewelry designs. I am sure the reward will be a match for your support and will bring great joy to you, and maybe gets passed down in your family for generations. Who knows :-) !!!</p>
<p><b>WHERE THE MONEY GOES</b></p>
<p>First and foremost, a big part of the funds that get generated go into crafting the promised rewards for you. It is precious handcrafted jewelry after all.</p>
<p>The balance of the funds that get generated go first into getting fresh and latest tools, equipment, chemicals, furniture and machinery for manufacture. </p>
<p>The third major expense would be to get good staff and artisans. </p>
<p>The fourth important expense is renting / buying a space suitable for the workshop depending upon the volume of support generated. </p>
<p>If we still have balance funds we will spend them in upgrading our online shop at <a href=""http://www.moah.in."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.moah.in.</a> <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">That is critical too as through it we will be able to bring to you the latest products right at your doorstep wherever you are. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If we reach our goal partially we will invest on priority in the first two, i.e., tools, machinery etc for the workshop, and getting good artisans to work for us. </span></p>

I realised I have found my true calling where I could exploit my creativity to the hilt and create 'real' and lasting pieces for people and families to cherish. There was a lot to learn and I had no coach. It took many years of learning bit by bit and a course in jewelry manufacture where I learnt to make jewelry by my own hand ( soldering, sawing, wire drawing, plate making, annealing, filing, polishing and the works).
Eventually, in 2005 my jewelry business came into existence. By 2007 my business was formally registered, I registered for my export licence too and set up my own handmade jewelry workshop where we made custom jewelry pieces by hand.
We got our own jewelry brand name ""MOAH"" registered soon after. 
WHY WE REQUIRE FUNDING
We got hit by the global recession of 2008. I tried to sustain my workshop but could manage for only a few months. My fledgling enterprise suffered a big blow. 
I began outsourcing the actual making of my designs to some outside manufacturing units whom I could trust. But I could not unleash my creativity anymore the way I did earlier with my own workshop. It became very limiting for me. Also, there were no economies of scale. The costing of my jewelry was not as comfortable anymore thereby impacting my sales adversely. 
Indian economy took some time to revive. The golden days are not back yet. But things are looking up.
At this juncture I really feel its time to set up my own blissful workshop again. With online selling structures in place I can really, truly make use of both my skills to create unique and beautiful designs, and to make them available across the world. This time round I would also like to add some good state-of-the art machinery to the workshop.
YOUR SUPPORT IS HUMBLY REQUESTED
I do request for your support. I cannot manage this on my own. I have put up a Jewelry Collection as a reward for your support. These are all original MOAH jewelry designs. I am sure the reward will be a match for your support and will bring great joy to you, and maybe gets passed down in your family for generations. Who knows :-) !!!
WHERE THE MONEY GOES
First and foremost, a big part of the funds that get generated go into crafting the promised rewards for you. It is precious handcrafted jewelry after all.
The balance of the funds that get generated go first into getting fresh and latest tools, equipment, chemicals, furniture and machinery for manufacture. 
The third major expense would be to get good staff and artisans. 
The fourth important expense is renting / buying a space suitable for the workshop depending upon the volume of support generated. 
If we still have balance funds we will spend them in upgrading our online shop at www.moah.in. That is critical too as through it we will be able to bring to you the latest products right at your doorstep wherever you are. 
If we reach our goal partially we will invest on priority in the first two, i.e., tools, machinery etc for the workshop, and getting good artisans to work for us.

You can also create a jewelry set by selecting multiple perks like the MOAH Champa Earrings, MOAH Champa Bracelet and MOAH Champa Cluster Pendant. We will be adding more pieces on the go.

ADDITIONAL SOCIAL IMPACT OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION
While skilled artisans are required to create gorgeous jewelry pieces, we would also be needing to hire less skilled or variously skilled people for work as office help, packaging, cleaning, organising the work space, etc.. For this we plan to hire women who are now single with the responsibility of bringing up their children on them. The more we grow as an enterprise, the more we will be able to support such women. I am one such woman and I know what it takes to rebuild life.  We also support Pahal, a charity which helps street children get education in schools thereby transforming their lives and that of their future generations. Without their intervention these children would have either been cleaning streets, or begging etc.. The august work being done by Pahal can be viewed on www.pahaljaipur.com. We pledge to give Pahal 2% of whatever money finally gets credited to our account through this campaign. We will keep you posted on this.  OTHER WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN HELP.We understand that some of you may not want to contribute. And its just fine. You are just as important to us.  Please support us by sharing this campaign with your family, friends and strangers via Facebook, Email, Twitter and the like. You can use the tools for sharing offered by this website. Help us spread the word !!! And we will be just as grateful.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

Welcome! </h2>
<p>Secret Shimapan is the very first brand of underwear that changes colors when you put them on! We use a combination of regular ink and a unique  thermosensitive ink that reacts to your body heat,<span> turning transparent at 31°C/88°F, creating a beautiful shimapan pattern. <br/></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433541639/zkilw4xsbwmgckx86v9m.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><span>These cute bikini-cut cotton panties not only come in gorgerous blue, pink, green or black models, but with enough funding, will also come in sizes that fit even the curviest of women, transgender ladies, and guys who just want to wear cute underwear.<br/></span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why do we need $8,500?<br/>
</h3> <ul>
<li>As it turns out, in order to comply with quality standards, we need to buy a  whooping 10 kilograms of specially made ink. This alone will cost us $1,000 dollars.</li>
<li>Then we need to pay everyone who is working on this project. This will be another $1,000.</li>
<li>We're going to have to buy the panties too, which amounts to $1,100.<br/>
</li>
<li>Finally there's the costs to buy a domain, build an webpage, and basically set up the entire online shop infrastructure after the campaign ends. All this amounts to a total of $903.50 to make the shop work for an entire year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wait, that doesn't amount to $8,500, so what gives?</h3>

My idea began when I was working on a Gold Mining Camp in Western Australia.  I quickly became aware of how many creepy crawlies lived among us and soon heard stories of the excruciating pain inflicted from spider bites and the horrors of ongoing treatment for reoccurring ulcers some bites can cause, all making me uncomfortably aware of 'What could be lurking in my boots!'  



Spiders, snakes, lizards, centipedes, scorpions, bees - the list was endless!

Because of these creatures crawling around I witnessed something of a morning ritual, where everyone noisily banged boots and shoes on the sides of buildings, onto the ground or slamming their boots together to rid them of any unwanted biters – the braver ones inserting their bare hands or upturning each boot over their eyes!!  
These actions, I discovered were not just limited to the Gold Mine, they are daily habits of everyday people all throughout Australia and in fact all around the world!I wondered,  how can this problem be fixed?So I designed... The Biter Fighters!               The Biter Fighter is made from specially selected foam balls that are tethered together to make a unit.  By simply compressing and inserting the balls into each boot the Biter Fighter foam expands to help prevent snakes, spiders centipedes and other creepy crawlies from entering your vacant boots or shoes!              

                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                   As we develop further into their territories, the more these creatures make our homes and work places their habitat which also makes contact with them increasingly more common.I am pleased to say that the Biter Fighter not only helps to protect our hands and feet from being bitten or stung, it also helps to prevent many of our important insects and small animals from being squashed accidentally!          TESTIMONIALS Sally    ""When Bronwyn first told me about Biter Fighters, my reaction was 'WOW' What a brilliant idea!  I had been bitten by a spider that was lurking in my favourite pair of Dr Marten boots which were on my bedroom floor!  Unusually my boot was rubbing, I removed the boot to find a blister on my ankle, the blister burst and a big lump appeared!  Over time it got worse with the flesh being eaten away, a week off work and a course of antibiotics.    Biter Fighters are great I use them indoors and out and they will certainly put my mind to rest when we go camping""                      'PLACE TO HIDE'                                            'PEACE OF MIND'                          V                     Deanne  ""My 3 year old daughter never wore those boots again - after a centipede bit her! But no bities in our boots now! The Biter Fighters are the best!  With 8 pairs of boots at our back door (riding boots and work boots) we all feel stress-free pulling our boots on knowing they are creepy crawly free!""                                               TESTING & EDUCATINGAs there are so many creepy crawlies, all with very different habits and functions, major testing was required to ensure that these insects and small animals did not get into the plugged footwear. We will certainly never forget our dealings with all the bugs and animals that helped us prove the Biter Fighter successful in keeping the creepy crawlies out! IF OUR PRODUCT CAN PROTECT YOU IN AUSTRALIA... IT'S SURE TO PROTECT YOU ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD!        The photos used in this campaign show a number of the test subjects that volunteered for the greater good of their species and ours of course!  They represent some of the more common varieties that live around us and below we have also noted how they actually help us.                           (No animals were harmed during the testing of the Biter Fighters :) We believe it is vitally important that we educate our children to respect our wildlife teaching them to live alongside our animals and insects, allowing them do their job as nature intended.OUR CRAZY RIDE Our Biter Fighter project has taken years of personal time, money and sometimes even tears, but with real persistence we have achieved the best design, the right foams and minimized packaging for easy shipping.  We were even awarded the Australian New Inventors 'Peoples Choice' Award! 'TALK ABOUT PROUD!!'Unfortunately we then learnt a very important, heartbreaking and expensive lesson on Importing - Always Always do your own Quality Control first! Our initial shipment was a disaster!  This was a huge set back and nearly broke us, but now armed with new knowledge and a new manufacturer, we have overcome!                  'WE ARE BACK & EVEN MORE DETERMINED TO SUCCEED!
   
THE CREWOur team, family and friends have been amazing as they are often forced to step out of their comfort zone and help with collecting, transporting, photographing, chasing or just hearing about some creepy crawly.  Their support and patience has been paramount in moving this project forward.    WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS           
With prototypes, vacuum packaging, Patent and Trademarks organised we are close to achieving our goal.

The small Biter Fighter is great for gloves.  It is not recommended for elasticated gloves over long periods.How do I know what size Biter Fighter fits my boot or shoe best?The foam ball should be slightly bigger than the opening of the shoe or boot.  Insert the compressed foam ball half to three quarters of the way into the shoe opening, adjust the ball to fill gaps.  If applicable pull shoe tongue up and tighten the laces creating a snugger fit around the ball.  If there are still gaps you may need to go to the next size up.  The foam ball only requires light pressure on the shoe to create a seal.  If the foam ball is too big and pushes the shoes outwards - go to a smaller size.What do I do if the Biter Fighter balls get wet?Simply wash gently and dry out of direct sunlight or heat and ensure the foam is clean and dry before placing into vacant shoes or boots.How do I maintain my Biter Fighters?  Ensure footwear is clean, dry and vacant.  Refrain from pulling on the string and aerate foam balls often.  Wash when needed and dry naturally!  Cared for this way your Biter Fighters will be fighting for you for a long time to come!    Bron - Inventor     Bart - long time supporter, partner and motivator      Sophie - Daughter, photographer and supporter Extraordinaire!Danny and Coco our wonderful ManufacturersMichael - Critters Up Close Mandurah WA (Awesome Educator on Oz wildlife)       Mel - Perth Design Web and PrintDavid - Creative Forte Fremantle WA, helping with our video                                          Teisha - Our Online Canteen - for all the hours away from you own business that you gifted to me Plus so many more amazing people whose care and support has got us here!Thank u Love u xxx",48.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Life is Made for Good JourneysAs the saying goes, the journey is just as important as the destination. But what actually, makes a journey worth the while?
Often times during our journeys, we are caught up with unexpected hiccups - be it misplacing our passport, having to face the wrath of messy cables or encountering the dreaded incident of a water bottle leakage that ends up destroying our gadgets and important documents.

 
 We strongly believe that journeys should be hassle-free. You're on a journey to do big and important things. You're out there to build great memories, forge new friendships and connections. You don't have the time to worry about trivial issues. We'll take care of that for you so you can focus on the things that matter.

Hey there, I'm Jo On, founder and Chief Exploration Officer at Goodtabi.
Goodtabi, literally translated as (yep,you guessed it) Good Journeys, is an extension of a personal problem that stemmed from an unhappy journey back in 2013 when I was travelling along the countryside of Yilan, Taiwan. 
It was during then when a coffee bottle I had brought along with me during the trip decided to take a leak and damaged everything I had inside my backpack - including my camera - a tool that I carry with me everywhere I travel to document the many great memories a good journey can offer.



This incident sparked a bigger mission within myself - in which journeys should be experienced comfortably and positively. Not just for myself, but for everyone.
Sincerely,
Jo

<br/>My career in modelling started when I was 14, when I was a promoter for a fashion-photographer. At that time I was also organizing photo-sessions for fashion-photography, promotions, and magazines. I opened my own modelling agency when I was 18, which is still operating successfully in Krasnoyarsk, and I started doing make-up and hair professionally at 19. When i was 20 I went to Bali in Indonesia to create art and to surf. And it is this island, with its happy and measured life, that inspired me to create my own line of clothing. After all, if everyone did what they know and love, then the world would be perfect. Don't you agree?<br/><br/>The Roho Roho company has operated there successfully for a year as an online store. We have pleased our customers with our style and quality, and they in turn have asked me to expand the range of materials and colours, and to add summer and evening collections.<br/><br/>I want to do this very much!</div><div>

<div>We want to delight you with high quality cool things!<br/>
</div>
<p></p>We have 4 tasks now:<br/><br/>1) To expand the range of knitted clothes, add new cardigans and mini and midi dresses that you can wear three seasons of the year, which you won't freeze in and still look awesome!<br/><br/>2) Add a new line of silk dresses for summer and evening.<br/><br/>3) Make a separate capsule collection called ""only black"" for fans of style and, of course, fans of black!<br/><br/>4) So, when we have made high quality, stylish, and affordable products made from natural materials we will be ready to enter the world market. We need to invest in the promotion of the site and brand by using social networking, collaboration with various events, and of course the creation of visual content.<br/>If we do not reach your entire goal - we will still certainly extend the existing collection of knitted goods made of natural wool.</div><div>

My name is Sofia Selina, I'm 23 years old and I am from a small city in Siberia, Russia.





My career in modelling started when I was 14, when I was a promoter for a fashion-photographer. At that time I was also organizing photo-sessions for fashion-photography, promotions, and magazines. I opened my own modelling agency when I was 18, which is still operating successfully in Krasnoyarsk, and I started doing make-up and hair professionally at 19. When i was 20 I went to Bali in Indonesia to create art and to surf. And it is this island, with its happy and measured life, that inspired me to create my own line of clothing. After all, if everyone did what they know and love, then the world would be perfect. Don't you agree?The Roho Roho company has operated there successfully for a year as an online store. We have pleased our customers with our style and quality, and they in turn have asked me to expand the range of materials and colours, and to add summer and evening collections.I want to do this very much!




   
What We Need & What You Get

We need to raise $ 9000 to start production in January 2016. 
We want to delight you with high quality cool things!

We have 4 tasks now:1) To expand the range of knitted clothes, add new cardigans and mini and midi dresses that you can wear three seasons of the year, which you won't freeze in and still look awesome!2) Add a new line of silk dresses for summer and evening.3) Make a separate capsule collection called ""only black"" for fans of style and, of course, fans of black!4) So, when we have made high quality, stylish, and affordable products made from natural materials we will be ready to enter the world market. We need to invest in the promotion of the site and brand by using social networking, collaboration with various events, and of course the creation of visual content.If we do not reach your entire goal - we will still certainly extend the existing collection of knitted goods made of natural wool.

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re traveling for a job interview, to visit family and friends, or just for vacation. You remembered to pack your hair trimmer so you can get in a quick grooming at the hotel before you go out. You always bring it with you because you like to look your best on these special occasions. Except this time you forgot the charger for your hair clipper, and yes, it is all out of charge… Or maybe you brought the charger but, since you’re in Paris, you need a special adapter for your charger to work… Or maybe you’re still packing for your trip and are tired of having to pack a different charger for every device you own…</p>
<p>That is why we thought, “Why not make one less travel item to worry about?” Since all electronics are moving towards USB-C charging, we decided to be the first to make that move for the hair trimmer. This way you can use the same charger for your phone, laptop, and your hair trimmer. It makes it a whole lot easier when traveling.</p>

<p>The Simba hair clipper is the first rechargeable hair clipper to use USB-C charging. Not only that, it also combines a lot of cool features that make it the most well rounded hair clipper:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB-C charger</li>
<li>Battery percentage indicator</li>
<li>Two long lasting rechargeable lithium ion batteries</li>
<li>5-in-1 hair clipper: full size trimmer, precision trimmer, nose/ear hair trimmer, body groomer, and foil shaver</li>
<li>6 different comb guides</li>
<li>All comb guides and clipper heads can be easily replaced in case you lose them</li>
<li>100% waterproof</li>
<li>A carrying case that helps you organize all of the pieces and is travel-friendly (optional)</li>

<p>The most iconic feature of the Simba hair clipper is the USB-C charging. This is the first hair clipper to introduce this consumer friendly technology. Our patent pending technology brings a long overdue innovation to the hair clipper market. The hair clipper comes with a USB-C to USB charging cable and a wall adapter.</p>
<p><strong>Battery Percentage Indicator</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577125495/tr9zjaxi5selr1jgragi.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Imagine the convenience of knowing how much charge you have left in your hair clipper. Our Simba clipper has a digital screen that tells you the exact percentage of battery that you have left. This lets you take your time grooming without worrying about running out of charge unexpectedly.</p>
<p><strong>Lithium Ion Batteries</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577125514/da4rqjbfv9uezaqjovmz.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Most hair clippers on the market last about 45 to 120 minutes on full charge. So we decided to use two rechargeable lithium ion batteries to give the hair clipper up to 4 hours of usage. Not only that, but the batteries are also capable of fast charging so you can be fully charged in only 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>5-in-1 Hair Clipper</strong></p>
<p>Instead of having to buy a different hair clipper for each of your grooming needs, the Simba Clipper comes with 5 interchangeable heads. These include a full size trimmer, a precision trimmer, a nose/ear hair trimmer, a body groomer, and a foil shaver. ""What happens if I lose one of the trimmer heads?"" Good question; you definitely don't have to buy a whole new set. These different heads will be available for separate purchase in case you lose one.</p>
<p>Full Size Trimmer:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577125543/eb3bqyoyhtaxzxt9y0xw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Precision Trimmer:</p>

<p>For styling of certain area you can use the precision trimmer which is similar to the full size trimmer but smaller in size.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nose/Ear Hair Trimmer:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577125588/nb8tnxqsdg0uvcgqxwhe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The nose/ear hair trimmer does exactly what it says. Nobody likes hair in those places anyways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Body Groomer:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577125610/rbnjqxrh06mx2ccfnhol.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The body groomer is great for full body hair trimming especially for sensitive areas.</p>

<p>Foil Shaver:</p>

<p>The foil shaver gives you a nice smooth shave without worrying about cutting yourself as opposed to a traditional razor.</p>
<p><strong>Comb Guides</strong></p>

<p>We have also included 6 different size comb guides. These are great for stylish haircuts or beard grooming. ""What happens if I lose one of the comb guides?"" Don’t worry! As with the trimmer heads, we are making the comb guides also available for purchase separately.</p>
<p><strong>100% Waterproof</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577125695/heb2typyxyoho5q5i93e.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Imaging having the perfect hair clipper but one accidental drop in the sink and it never works again. The Simba Clipper is 100% waterproof.</p>

<p>With all of these great accessories you need a good place to store them. That is why we have added an optional travel friendly carrying case. The case is made with artificial leather to make it look stylish. The case has a specific slot for the hair clipper and also for the interchangeable heads. It also has an internal pocket to store the charger and comb guides.</p>

We've revolutionized boxer shorts to put an end to chafe and skin irritation without sacrificing style. You no longer have to wear a single type of underwear for every kind of day-to-day activity. Let's face it, men, that's not good enough.These underwear/shorts are divided into 3 models:For sports as it is seamless with sweat absorption, wearable with leggings and marathons, and the likes.Business line, because it has more space in front so you don't see your stuff when you wear a suit. It has a special sweat absorption at the rear so as to make sure you won't see any sweat, thereby keeping your stuff cool always).Labor line, as prepared for people in uniform; police, military, mechanics, and so on.We are here to offer the introductory package of MAXILLE underwear at 50EUR per pack and each pack will contain all the 3 models of the shorts as explained above. The money raised through the sales we make here will enough us to invest more into marketing and atelier, thereby enabling us to produce more in large quantity and be able to maintain our stance in the fashion market. THE ULTIMATE MAXILLE UNDERWEARThroughout the years we've been bothered by the way men’s underwear looks and feels as it's not compatible with different types of situations.These brief shorts were created for men to suit 3 different lifestyles/occasions and day-to-day activities.The 3 models are:Sports line: Seamless underwear, fit for compression pants, leggings, regular sports. Cooling materials with a streamlined fit on the body. Keeps your stuff in place and lowers the chance on injuries, and irritations Business line: Special materials that are non-static under a woolen costume. There is more space up front. This is to ensure that when wearing a suit, not everything, especially your stuff, will be visible. There is also sweat absorption at the rear portion of the short, meant to suit the stressful moments (presentations, job interviews, first dates, meeting the family or when drinking too much coffee). Enough breathing space has been left out just in case if there will be any drops in front, the space will accommodate it and make it invisible on pantaloons. Casual/Labor: Meant for men in uniform, labor clothing (Police, Engineers, Mechanics, Hobbyist, Plumbers, Militaries, Chefs, and so on), it is water repellent on the inside; sweat or other fluids would be absorbed by the underwear. Made from protective clothing materials, it will keep your stuff cool, with no irritation. On the back inside is a special seam to prevent ‘plumber cleavage’. This underwear is perfect for any active man that likes to get his hands dirty. While you are here, this is the best time to cop yours at a discount, minimal and affordable cost.We are selling an introductory offer of 5000 MAXILLE shorts at a special discount of 50EUR a pack, with each pack containing the 3 models of the brief shorts/underwear. With the full funding of 210,000EUR, we will also be able to pay for the following:
Purchase of production materials and machineries
Renting/acquiring of workspace (an atelier)
Marketing costs
Hiring and paying of more staffs
Reward fulfillment
Indiegogo processing fees
Other miscellaneous and unforeseen costs
  Success rate: In order to maintain proper pricing; there should be a minimum of orders. The lowest minimum that we could do while maintaining the same price would be 1000 packs (50,000), anything lower than that would bring us closer to lost, rather than profit.Reach: We do have budget allocated to advertise our fundraising campaign. However, we are limited to that budget.  As with most crowdfunding projects, there may be some unexpected circumstances and or scenarios; but our team is fully prepared to take on any challenges by virtue of our full preparedness and crowdfunding experience. If we do run into any logistical challenges so significant that may delay us, we will be sure to keep all our contributors in the loop. In order to maintain a proper timeline, the moment between the first order and last order (before reaching the goal) will be as short as possible so that customers can maintain their interests and one bulk order can be processed at once in the factory. In addition to supporting this project, you can also show your support by sharing the link to this campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use.

</div></div>","GRYP was birthed out of our disappointment in the conventional anti-slip solutions for eyewear. They were painful and fragile. But, we couldn't deny the importance of having help to keep your spectacles firmly on your face. 
 

 

 
This also becomes a possibility of germs entering your body through your eyes, nose and face.
 

 

 
We want to give you one less reason to reach for your face

 
 
 Choosing the right GRYP for your spectacles If your temple tips fall somewhere in the middle, not quite too small or large, we recommend getting a small! This is because our GRYPs are extremely durable and elastic. Even our small GRYPs are able to stretch wider than the given specifications. Small GRYP with a medium-sized temple tipLook at our small size stretch!But if you have any questions, feel free to shoot us an email at contact@wearegryp.com, and we'll gladly help figure things out with you! Simply wash it regularly (along with the temple tips of your spectacles!) with some tap water and soap. Use our Indiegogo exclusive mini cleaning brush to give your GRYPs a good clean.

<p>For this new style we've taken a piece of classic Americana and converted it into sneaker form. The epitome of casual elegance, the tasseled loafer is considered a business classic amongst bankers and stock brokers but just as easily transitions into a smart weekend look. </p>

<p>The quintessential business shoe, the cap toe oxford has long been the most formal shoe to wear with a suit. We've adapted this classic business shoe into sneaker form to give you boardroom style without the aches and pains of traditional dress shoes. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535074786/klc59vxpttepnosrdjxe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What's new?</strong></p>
<p>Black Pebbled: We've added a supple pebbled leather to the black oxford to give the shoe a bit of texture when seen up close. In addition, the pebbled leather makes the shoes softer and more comfortable as the pebbling process breaks in the leather considerably.</p>
<p>Dark Brown: In the spirit of comfort, we've added suede to the brown oxford. Again, this adds visual texture to the shoe as well as enhances comfort due to the suede's softness. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539108781/vlj8sp6yypgd86cc50lz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Mahogany: Due to popular demand, we're releasing an oxford in a beautiful mahogany/ oxblood colour. This is easily our favourite shoe colour due to its sheer versatility. It is stunning with navy or charcoal suits and even looks great with black suits.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539746882/g7zfsmqueawwvh3eptmj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Patent leather: Traditionally patent leather is the evening version of the black business shoe and therefore reserved for black tie events.  But we also like to wear them with stylishly torn jeans and a black leather jacket in our down time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538344851/o8928ylieskmzkvrl6fg.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>A classic daytime shoe that owes much of its popularity to the fact it goes as well with a suit as it does a pair of jeans. We've added our signature low profile sole to strike the perfect balance between classic and modern. Now you can finally replace that stiff pair of brogues sitting at the back of your closet!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539198596/c0hbh1ussvyavevmq20f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What's new?</strong></p>
<p>Black Pebbled:  Just like the oxford, we've added pebbled leather to the mid-foot of the shoe to give it a refined texture. </p>
<p>Tan &amp; Noble Blue Suede:   We've paired our rich tan leather with a deep blue suede to create another stunning 2-tone shoe for those who like a bold statement.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539620363/oqptcyupbvgtxw6m8whb.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>We've taken care to create a truly elegant sneaker version of a chelsea boot.  The wide elastic goring on the sides makes this boot a breeze to slip on and of. And with its sleek tapered toe and low profile sole the Chelsea boot will easily take to you to office, home and beyond.</p>

<p>What good is a great pair of shoes if you can't find a matching belt?  We've made it easy for you to get you hands on that all too elusive matching belt by partnering with small belt-making workshop located close to where our shoes are made in Portugal.</p>
<p> All belts come in one length and can easily be trimmed to the perfect length by yourself or your local cobbler. If you want to DIY, we've prepared a <a href=""https://noblesole.com/blogs/news/how-to"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">short guide here</a>.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0405/2513/files/Webp.net-gifmaker_4_grande.gif?v=1539666916"" src=""""/><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537936606/o7onbqwcmphzted8xyn2.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>We created our shoes as an alternative to the discomfort of traditional business shoes.</p>
<p>Good quality dress shoes are pretty heavy duty in their construction but the downside is they hurt your feet and take a long time to break in. Rather than use these traditional construction techniques we have opted for modern strobel construction which results in a lighter and more flexible shoe.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0405/2513/files/can-your-dress-shoes-do-this-2_grande.gif?v=1539712434"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Lastly, we have done away with old fashioned elevated heel. Dress shoes typically have 2.5 cm (1 inch) heel which throws off your body's natural alignment and can cause back and joint pain.  Our shoes have a 5mm (0.2 inch) drop from heel to forefoot so you can walk naturally and pain free.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539662206/ft1vva3ou8orgtjgcnlr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We're confident that once you step into our shoes you will never wear another pair of old fashioned dress shoes. But forget what we say. Here is some of the great things other people are saying about our shoes:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0405/2513/files/Webp.net-gifmaker_3_grande.gif?v=1539575075"" src=""""/> </p>

<p>If you require an orthotic our insoles easily slide out so you can comfortably wear the shoe without compromising your health or safety. No more sizing up or praying the shoe will stretch enough to be comfortable.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Where its made</h2>
<p>We have carefully selected a naturally finished calf leather for the shoe uppers.  And for the inside of the shoe we use a soft yet durable vachetta lining. This combination of soft leathers, classic dress shoe styling and comfortable sneaker construction creates a shoe that will be one of the most comfortable shoes you will ever own. </p>
<p>We use leather sourced from one of the best Italian tanneries and the shoes are manufactured by an artisanal, family-owned factory in Portugal's shoe capital. Check out the video below to see the factory in action.</p>

<p>If you have a <strong>narrow foot</strong> please <strong>size down</strong>. </p>

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE - We know to get the shoes made properly and on time. Our last campaign encountered a few challenges that we learned from and have applied those lessons to this campaign.</p>
<p>QUALITY - We are working with one of the top footwear manufacturers in Portugal. We have chosen premium leathers and components for our shoes.</p>
<p>SURVEY - We opted for IndieGoGo this time around as a way to skip the extremely time consuming survey stage. This will help you receive your shoes sooner.</p>
<p>Because backers can select the model, size and colour when placing your pledge we can send the order to the factory as soon as the campaign is over! </p>
<p>RETURNS - If you receive the wrong size or colour, you have 30 days to exchange the shoes. Just follow the directions on the packing slip. The packing slip will have a customer support email address.</p>
<p>If, once you receive your shoes, you wish to change the size/colour, there is a $15 fee to cover us shipping you a new pair. Just fill out the exchange form included with your shipment and ship your shoes back to the address indicated on the exchange form. All exchanges must be made within 30 days of receiving your shoes. Exchanges cannot be processed after 30 days of receipt.</p>

Frequent travellers will love the slip-on/slip-off ease of our penny loafer as navigating airport security becomes a breeze. 


 
 

 
For this new style we've taken a piece of classic Americana and converted it into sneaker form. The epitome of casual elegance, the tasseled loafer is considered a business classic amongst bankers and stock brokers but just as easily transitions into a smart weekend look. 



 

 
The quintessential business shoe, the cap toe oxford has long been the most formal shoe to wear with a suit. We've adapted this classic business shoe into sneaker form to give you boardroom style without the aches and pains of traditional dress shoes. 

 
What's new?
Black Pebbled: We've added a supple pebbled leather to the black oxford to give the shoe a bit of texture when seen up close. In addition, the pebbled leather makes the shoes softer and more comfortable as the pebbling process breaks in the leather considerably.
Dark Brown: In the spirit of comfort, we've added suede to the brown oxford. Again, this adds visual texture to the shoe as well as enhances comfort due to the suede's softness. 

Mahogany: Due to popular demand, we're releasing an oxford in a beautiful mahogany/ oxblood colour. This is easily our favourite shoe colour due to its sheer versatility. It is stunning with navy or charcoal suits and even looks great with black suits.

 
Patent leather: Traditionally patent leather is the evening version of the black business shoe and therefore reserved for black tie events.  But we also like to wear them with stylishly torn jeans and a black leather jacket in our down time.
 

 
A classic daytime shoe that owes much of its popularity to the fact it goes as well with a suit as it does a pair of jeans. We've added our signature low profile sole to strike the perfect balance between classic and modern. Now you can finally replace that stiff pair of brogues sitting at the back of your closet!

What's new?
Black Pebbled:  Just like the oxford, we've added pebbled leather to the mid-foot of the shoe to give it a refined texture. 
Tan & Noble Blue Suede:   We've paired our rich tan leather with a deep blue suede to create another stunning 2-tone shoe for those who like a bold statement.

Espresso:  The classic workhorse shoe, we've brought back our brown wingtip due to popular demand.

 
Noble Blue:   For those that want something a little different than the average, we've added the possibility to unlock a stunning blue version of our wingtip. Best worn with light grey suits and tans.
 

 
We've taken care to create a truly elegant sneaker version of a chelsea boot.  The wide elastic goring on the sides makes this boot a breeze to slip on and of. And with its sleek tapered toe and low profile sole the Chelsea boot will easily take to you to office, home and beyond.


 

 
What good is a great pair of shoes if you can't find a matching belt?  We've made it easy for you to get you hands on that all too elusive matching belt by partnering with small belt-making workshop located close to where our shoes are made in Portugal.
 All belts come in one length and can easily be trimmed to the perfect length by yourself or your local cobbler. If you want to DIY, we've prepared a short guide here.

We created our shoes as an alternative to the discomfort of traditional business shoes.
Good quality dress shoes are pretty heavy duty in their construction but the downside is they hurt your feet and take a long time to break in. Rather than use these traditional construction techniques we have opted for modern strobel construction which results in a lighter and more flexible shoe.

Lastly, we have done away with old fashioned elevated heel. Dress shoes typically have 2.5 cm (1 inch) heel which throws off your body's natural alignment and can cause back and joint pain.  Our shoes have a 5mm (0.2 inch) drop from heel to forefoot so you can walk naturally and pain free.

We're confident that once you step into our shoes you will never wear another pair of old fashioned dress shoes. But forget what we say. Here is some of the great things other people are saying about our shoes:
 
 

We have designed our shoes to be versatile. So versatile that you can step into the office Monday morning ready for business and step out Friday evening ready for the weekend without even changing your shoes.
 




With a shoe that performs double duty it just got easier to pack efficiently and still be prepared for anything. No more wasting precious space in your luggage thanks to multiple pairs of shoes. Now you can skip the long wait at the baggage carousel and get right down to business.


All of our shoes come fully equipped with removable full length insoles that will mould to the shape of your foot over time.

If you require an orthotic our insoles easily slide out so you can comfortably wear the shoe without compromising your health or safety. No more sizing up or praying the shoe will stretch enough to be comfortable.
Where its made
We have carefully selected a naturally finished calf leather for the shoe uppers.  And for the inside of the shoe we use a soft yet durable vachetta lining. This combination of soft leathers, classic dress shoe styling and comfortable sneaker construction creates a shoe that will be one of the most comfortable shoes you will ever own. 
We use leather sourced from one of the best Italian tanneries and the shoes are manufactured by an artisanal, family-owned factory in Portugal's shoe capital. Check out the video below to see the factory in action.
 

 



 Our shoes are sized according to the Euro scale. If you're not familiar with Euro sizing please refer to the chart below. 
Notes on sizing:
Our shoes fit true to size and come in full sizes only. 
If you normally wear a half size (ie. 10.5 US) please round up. 
If you have a narrow foot please size down. 
If you have a wide foot, please size up.
If your foot is EEE or wider we unfortunately do not have a solution for you at this time. We are working on one though!
If using another shoe as a size reference, please use your dress shoe size instead of your sneaker size.
 
Risks and challenges
WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE - We know to get the shoes made properly and on time. Our last campaign encountered a few challenges that we learned from and have applied those lessons to this campaign.
QUALITY - We are working with one of the top footwear manufacturers in Portugal. We have chosen premium leathers and components for our shoes.
SURVEY - We opted for IndieGoGo this time around as a way to skip the extremely time consuming survey stage. This will help you receive your shoes sooner.
Because backers can select the model, size and colour when placing your pledge we can send the order to the factory as soon as the campaign is over! 
RETURNS - If you receive the wrong size or colour, you have 30 days to exchange the shoes. Just follow the directions on the packing slip. The packing slip will have a customer support email address.
If, once you receive your shoes, you wish to change the size/colour, there is a $15 fee to cover us shipping you a new pair. Just fill out the exchange form included with your shipment and ship your shoes back to the address indicated on the exchange form. All exchanges must be made within 30 days of receiving your shoes. Exchanges cannot be processed after 30 days of receipt.",40.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Strain Apparel is a new cannabis lifestyle brand that offers patented odor-absorbing pockets with a positive, yet discreet, celebration of the cannabis strains we all know and love.

<h3> </h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Pierre, and I am the founder of Chronos touch</p>
<p>I established Chronos touch in October 2017</p>
<p>As the youngest out of four children, I was always told what I would need to do in order to get by in life, which was finish school, get a nice job, and get married, and most people with my mindset, didn’t want to follow the same social norms that have been taught to my older siblings, so, I needed to branch out</p>
<p>I got into entrepreneurship because the possibilities for advancement are endless!! the amount of money you make is completely up to you, plus, who wouldn’t want the possibility to retire 30 years before you would if you had a regular 9-5!! I'm just saying! sounds like a pretty awesome idea heard it</p>
<p>I made this watch in order to embody my creativity, from the aluminum watch face to the logo on the clasp, This watch is giving you all a tour into my life and aspirations! This brand is going to be a game changer because people like you can send us submissions in to have a watch designed specifically by you!! yupp I said by YOU!! Contests will start readily soon to pick the best design for our exclusive collections and we can't wait to see what you come up with!!</p>
<p>If you like what I’m setting out on the table then please become a contributor and back my Indiegogo page. You can also give us a like on our Facebook Page name: Chronos Touch, or follow us on Instagram @chronostouch and receive 25% off your first order.Thanks for watching now let’s make our story</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking for $20,000 which will go to the advancement of legalizing my company and upgrading the current collection, and the production for my new deity collection. If you become a contributor and spend at least $15 dollars you will receive a custom zodiac bracelet with your own astrology sign. $100 or more will get you your own watch from our current Prometheus collection. If i don't reach my goal, the funds will go towards the company.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Watches have always been a status symbol throughout the world and we can all agree based on the watch you wear it helps explain your story. This is what i want this brand to achieve a story for anyone in any social status, any walk of life, because as a person who has always been in the best financial situations, i would still value my creativity and presence to shine better to anyone who doesn't know me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm honestly have risked everything to make this brand come to life. I currently am unemployed and my last bit of money has went into this production. So i will use all social media and local media to help grow this watch company into an empire.</p>
</div><div>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it. Thank you for the support</p></div>","Hello, my name is Pierre, and I am the founder of Chronos touch
I established Chronos touch in October 2017
As the youngest out of four children, I was always told what I would need to do in order to get by in life, which was finish school, get a nice job, and get married, and most people with my mindset, didn’t want to follow the same social norms that have been taught to my older siblings, so, I needed to branch out
I got into entrepreneurship because the possibilities for advancement are endless!! the amount of money you make is completely up to you, plus, who wouldn’t want the possibility to retire 30 years before you would if you had a regular 9-5!! I'm just saying! sounds like a pretty awesome idea heard it
I made this watch in order to embody my creativity, from the aluminum watch face to the logo on the clasp, This watch is giving you all a tour into my life and aspirations! This brand is going to be a game changer because people like you can send us submissions in to have a watch designed specifically by you!! yupp I said by YOU!! Contests will start readily soon to pick the best design for our exclusive collections and we can't wait to see what you come up with!!
If you like what I’m setting out on the table then please become a contributor and back my Indiegogo page. You can also give us a like on our Facebook Page name: Chronos Touch, or follow us on Instagram @chronostouch and receive 25% off your first order.Thanks for watching now let’s make our story

What We Need & What You Get
I'm looking for $20,000 which will go to the advancement of legalizing my company and upgrading the current collection, and the production for my new deity collection. If you become a contributor and spend at least $15 dollars you will receive a custom zodiac bracelet with your own astrology sign. $100 or more will get you your own watch from our current Prometheus collection. If i don't reach my goal, the funds will go towards the company.

The Impact
Watches have always been a status symbol throughout the world and we can all agree based on the watch you wear it helps explain your story. This is what i want this brand to achieve a story for anyone in any social status, any walk of life, because as a person who has always been in the best financial situations, i would still value my creativity and presence to shine better to anyone who doesn't know me.

Risks & Challenges
I'm honestly have risked everything to make this brand come to life. I currently am unemployed and my last bit of money has went into this production. So i will use all social media and local media to help grow this watch company into an empire.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, that's totally fine!!

<h3>New ideas of using Macrame Cord</h3>
<p>There was a day when I needed big storage baskets for storing my baby girl's toys. I could not find anything what I wanted. I started looking for craft suppliers that I could use to make my own baskets. This is when I found the fabulous, resistant, <strong>LONG LASTING</strong>, <strong>HIGH QUALITY</strong> and <strong>COLORFUL </strong>macrame cord.

<br/>
</h2><p></p><p>Hello Everyone! </p><p><br/>We are a bunch of closely-knitted friends who shares a common interest in classic timepieces. And here is our story:</p><p><br/>
 When we were much younger, we used to do window shopping of watch 
stores, telling each other, ""One day, I'm going to buy that"". Even till 
today, most of those classic pieces still sits in those windows. As we 
grew older, we found out that such watches are exorbitantly expensive 
and almost unreachable towards the masses. Heartbroken and desperate, we
 were determined to search for a classic watch that is both attractive 
and affordable. </p><p><br/>After months and years of 'window shopping', we 
did came across a few but ultimately decided to come up with our own. We
 aimed for that impossible balance between affordability, daily usability and 
sophisticated beauty. A watch that one could take to the beach as well as a formal dinner event.<br/></p><p> </p><p>
</p><p></p><h2></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446020733/xffmfpcsrxdvix0zkp3r.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 290.272px;height: 362px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446021126/l6z92exhzrevdrx1rty0.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 272.793px;height: 363px;""/>
<br/></p><p></p>Impossible? Not at <b>RoyalOctober</b>. We are a dedicated and 
passionate team that will strive to provide and solve the impossible.<p></p><h2></h2><p><br/>

<br/><br/>
<h2>Why RoyalOctober?</h2>
<p>RoyalOctober is about our friendship and how we value people around us. </p>
<h4>Royal</h4>
<p>Royalty
 as we know, can only be passed on. Many of us dreamed and thought 
of what is it like to be a King, Queen, Prince or Princess. They receive
 the best things life has to offer. We want you to feel the same, to get
 the best. Thus, we placed the word 'Royal' in front, prioritizing the 
importance of how we treat our customers and our immense dedication to quality. </p>
<h4>October</h4>
<p>Our current watch face design was inspired by a teen when he was drawing two clocks, drawing the smaller one on top of the other. He was talented and also had a flair for drawing clocks. However, he diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the tender age of 3. This prompted us to take his design and make a watch to celebrate World Cerebral Palsy Day, which falls in the month of October.</p><p>50% of all profits will be donated to Cerebral Palsy foundations spread across the world. <br/></p><p>Its a unique brand name consisting of two different yet important 
aspects. As much as we'd like for it, we felt that wearing another 
person's name on our wrist does not say much about the dedication to 
quality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446279944/qjhrn9edhrrfqgrsvloc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 428.505px;height: 321px;""/></p>

<br/>
<div> <h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2> <p>100%
 of the funding received will go directly into the cost of materials for
 the watch, labor costs and marketing/advertising costs. We plan to 
further create a better overall experience when purchasing a <b>RoyalOctober</b>
 timepiece. We will also consistently improve our products line-up and 
provide excellent after-sales support. In fact, we are extremely 
confident of our products that we will give a one-year warranty to all 
timepieces and do a one-for-one exchange if found defected.   
</p>
<p>Our watches have a distinct touch that separates itself from other 
competitors. Although affordable, we have not sacrificed quality. We 
designed our watches to feel and look elegant. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446020103/uase6wwrynpckrbovnrr.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 444.437px;height: 333px;""/></p>
<p>The Roman numeric XII marker at the 12 o'clock position signifies our
 beliefs in the important values of history and heritage. The remaining 
hour markers are individually placed and not imprinted on, thus 
providing a more rich and dimensional visual effect.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446019669/ykvigmkgpdnujdxwmpxj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 439.925px;height: 353px;""/></p>
<p>To further keep track of time, a minute repeater is placed at the 6 
o'clock position. The minute repeater was implemented as we felt that an
 overlapping and ticking second-hand against the dial did not portray a

</div><br/><p></p></div>","Summary of Our Project - RoyalOctober Watches

Hello Everyone! We are a bunch of closely-knitted friends who shares a common interest in classic timepieces. And here is our story:
 When we were much younger, we used to do window shopping of watch 
stores, telling each other, ""One day, I'm going to buy that"". Even till 
today, most of those classic pieces still sits in those windows. As we 
grew older, we found out that such watches are exorbitantly expensive 
and almost unreachable towards the masses. Heartbroken and desperate, we
 were determined to search for a classic watch that is both attractive 
and affordable. After months and years of 'window shopping', we 
did came across a few but ultimately decided to come up with our own. We
 aimed for that impossible balance between affordability, daily usability and 
sophisticated beauty. A watch that one could take to the beach as well as a formal dinner event. 
 
Impossible? Not at RoyalOctober. We are a dedicated and 
passionate team that will strive to provide and solve the impossible.


Why RoyalOctober?
RoyalOctober is about our friendship and how we value people around us. 
Royal
Royalty
 as we know, can only be passed on. Many of us dreamed and thought 
of what is it like to be a King, Queen, Prince or Princess. They receive
 the best things life has to offer. We want you to feel the same, to get
 the best. Thus, we placed the word 'Royal' in front, prioritizing the 
importance of how we treat our customers and our immense dedication to quality. 
October
Our current watch face design was inspired by a teen when he was drawing two clocks, drawing the smaller one on top of the other. He was talented and also had a flair for drawing clocks. However, he diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the tender age of 3. This prompted us to take his design and make a watch to celebrate World Cerebral Palsy Day, which falls in the month of October.50% of all profits will be donated to Cerebral Palsy foundations spread across the world. Its a unique brand name consisting of two different yet important 
aspects. As much as we'd like for it, we felt that wearing another 
person's name on our wrist does not say much about the dedication to 
quality.



 What We Need & What You Get 100%
 of the funding received will go directly into the cost of materials for
 the watch, labor costs and marketing/advertising costs. We plan to 
further create a better overall experience when purchasing a RoyalOctober
 timepiece. We will also consistently improve our products line-up and 
provide excellent after-sales support. In fact, we are extremely 
confident of our products that we will give a one-year warranty to all 
timepieces and do a one-for-one exchange if found defected.   

Our watches have a distinct touch that separates itself from other 
competitors. Although affordable, we have not sacrificed quality. We 
designed our watches to feel and look elegant. 

The Roman numeric XII marker at the 12 o'clock position signifies our
 beliefs in the important values of history and heritage. The remaining 
hour markers are individually placed and not imprinted on, thus 
providing a more rich and dimensional visual effect.

To further keep track of time, a minute repeater is placed at the 6 
o'clock position. The minute repeater was implemented as we felt that an
 overlapping and ticking second-hand against the dial did not portray a 
smooth finish.




RoyalOctober is all about stirring up the emotions.Perfect on any day, any occasion, at any time.












We chose the less subtle polished rose gold and silver cases as they are non-restrictive and the best at showing its true value.
Entire
 watch case is made with 316L stainless steel to give you rust-free 
assurance. Most watches only provide a stainless steel back to cut cost at the expense of quality and reliability. 
Each case is 40mm in diameter. Wide enough to provide a clear 
display yet gentle on the eyes. Perfect for any gender or wrist size.  
The Swiss-Made Ronda movement is used as it is one of the most reliable 
and well-produced movement. We could go with a Japanese movement but it does not 
provide that refined Swiss Quality experience we all seek. 
A scratch resistance sapphire glass provides necessary protection at the
 most crucial area, yet glorifying the watch face with sophistication.

Our watches comes in 3 face colors:
Gold & Gold. Slightly softened with rosy hints to give out a gentle appeal.

  

Silver & Blue. Handsome & Edgy. Brings out the confidence and cool factor.
  Silver & Pink. Pretty & Sweet. First of its kind and bound to create sparkles.

<h3>[for Japanese, visit <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BearingPairRing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/BearingPairRing/]</a>

<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary; Bearing Pair Ring (BPR)</h3>
<p>This is a (pair of) laser-marked bearing ring(s) fidget spinner for your finger. You can wear this Bearing Pair Ring (BPR) anywhere with you. BPR uses a Japanese famous manufacture's super precision bearing  so it rotates very smoothly on your finger. It makes your anxiety better and you feel good. Need concentrated while working, thinking, studying or business meeting? This is for you. </p>
<ul>
<li>I am always wondering that the other spinners are too big and stand out...aren't you?</li>
<li>The BPR's diameter is small so its spinning power is maybe smaller than the ordinary large  spinners. 10 seconds or so...You need keep twirling and touching. <strong>Wanna just watch the spinners spinning for a minute or more? BPR maybe isn't yours. Think twice.</strong>
</li>
<li>You can twirl BPR while inputting keyboard or doing something with your finger. You can not with the other spinners.</li>
<li>Precision laser marking is processed in Tokyo, Japan.</li>
<li>Marked pattern is the Japanese traditional one called ""<i>kagome""</i> (basket eyes).</li>
<li>Personalization available with up to 10 uppercase letters (optional).</li>
<li>Don't need a pair? OK, of course! BPR SOLO version (just one ring) is also on this project.</li>
<li>There are some stretch goals! See below.</li>

<h3>Please know...</h3>
<p>The BPR is almost the same size of ordinary rings. The bearing is made from stainless steel so the color you will receive is metallic silver. While processing with laser, the pattern is a bit burnt and lines turn into brown-colored. A bearing is built with inner ring, tiny steel balls and outer ring. Please DO NOT screw a tight bearing to your finger. It is rotating smoothly so very difficult to pull out. Please read the size chart carefully. If you need from US6 to 8, get BPR18mm.

Short Summary; Bearing Pair Ring (BPR)
This is a (pair of) laser-marked bearing ring(s) fidget spinner for your finger. You can wear this Bearing Pair Ring (BPR) anywhere with you. BPR uses a Japanese famous manufacture's super precision bearing  so it rotates very smoothly on your finger. It makes your anxiety better and you feel good. Need concentrated while working, thinking, studying or business meeting? This is for you. 

I am always wondering that the other spinners are too big and stand out...aren't you?
The BPR's diameter is small so its spinning power is maybe smaller than the ordinary large  spinners. 10 seconds or so...You need keep twirling and touching. Wanna just watch the spinners spinning for a minute or more? BPR maybe isn't yours. Think twice.

You can twirl BPR while inputting keyboard or doing something with your finger. You can not with the other spinners.
Precision laser marking is processed in Tokyo, Japan.
Marked pattern is the Japanese traditional one called ""kagome"" (basket eyes).
Personalization available with up to 10 uppercase letters (optional).
Don't need a pair? OK, of course! BPR SOLO version (just one ring) is also on this project.

<p>The Messier is waterproof to IP67 standard, meaning you will
not need to take it off the next time you’re spending the day on the beach. On
top of full connectivity, the Messier can function as a standalone phone in its
own right, taking a SIM card, making and receiving calls, and working in
conjunction with a Bluetooth earpiece. Again, the next time you plan a day
trip, you can rely on your Messier – and leave that clunky smartphone at home

<p>Pro-Belts has been designing and manufacturing championship trophy belts for over 15 years for professional sports venues including the UFC, WWE and most recently, the Washington Redskins. We have a lot of experience delivering high quality, professional-grade belts to our customers. We are confident that we can meet the delivery dates and expectations of our supporters.</p>
<p>We believe the single largest risk to completing this project successfully will be in securing a license from The Ohio State University that will allow us to use the school's trademarks on the trophy belt as depicted in the product drawings.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a licensor, the two key factors in granting a license generally tend to be proof of market demand and manufacturing capacity.  Given our manufacturing experience and established resources, we are confident that our capabilities can meet the University's expectations. </p>
<p>We also hope that the demand demonstrated through a successful crowdfunding campaign will provide conclusive market evidence to the University to confidently grant the license.</p>
<p>In the event we are not granted the license needed, we will return, at a minimum, 95% of the backers’ deposits. Any funds used will be solely to cover any fees due to Indiegogo for the use of their services.</p>

Great tool making used in casting the plates is the foundation of producing a beautifully finished belt.    
It takes precision in craftsmanship and time to get the perfect product. Polishing and plating is part art and part science, but critical to the quality of our championship belts! 
We've provided a few pictures of the Washington Redskins' Trophy Belt plates to help show the development process from start to finish. 









Pro-Belts has been designing and manufacturing championship trophy belts for over 15 years for professional sports venues including the UFC, WWE and most recently, the Washington Redskins. We have a lot of experience delivering high quality, professional-grade belts to our customers. We are confident that we can meet the delivery dates and expectations of our supporters.
We believe the single largest risk to completing this project successfully will be in securing a license from The Ohio State University that will allow us to use the school's trademarks on the trophy belt as depicted in the product drawings.
From the perspective of a licensor, the two key factors in granting a license generally tend to be proof of market demand and manufacturing capacity.  Given our manufacturing experience and established resources, we are confident that our capabilities can meet the University's expectations. 
We also hope that the demand demonstrated through a successful crowdfunding campaign will provide conclusive market evidence to the University to confidently grant the license.
In the event we are not granted the license needed, we will return, at a minimum, 95% of the backers’ deposits. Any funds used will be solely to cover any fees due to Indiegogo for the use of their services.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Patriot Shoes: Who we are and why are we doing this?</h3>
<p>Patriot Shoes isn't a big company with grand plans to take over the world of shoes. We're a small group who are more concerned with setting the record straight than with selling a lot of shoes.<br/><br/>You may have read in the news earlier this summer, a major athletic shoe and clothing brand (we won't say which, but the really big) was set to release a pair of shoes which would feature the ""Betsy Ross"" flag. Before that could happen, the shoes were canceled at the advice of one of the companies spokes people (we won't say who, but it was a former pro quarterback who's been in the news for more than football) who called flag was a symbol of racism. The reasoning being that the flag was created at a time slavery existed in what would become our nation. But, that would mean EVERYTHING from that period of history is a symbol of racism. Slavery wasn't a the reason the flag was created. The flag was created to be a symbol of the revolution being fought to create a new nation. Slavery was not a motivation for fighting the revolution. The revolution was fought to create a nation where ""all men are created equal"", even if it took more time to realize that vision. Nothing on the flag represents slavery. A journalist wrote at the time ""The stars were disposed in a circle, symbolizing the perpetuity of the Union; the ring, like the circling serpent of the Egyptians, signifying eternity. The thirteen stripes showed with the stars the number of the United Colonies, and denoted the subordination of the States to the Union, as well as equality among themselves."" and Charles Thomson, former Secretary of the Continental Congress, wrote to the new Congress ""The colours of the pales are those used in the flag of the United States of America. White signifies purity and innocence. Red hardiness and valour and Blue the colour of the Chief signifies vigilance perseverance and justice.""<br/><br/>As patriots and lovers of American history, we were dumbfounded when we heard why the shoes would not become available for sale. At first we joked someone should make their shoes with the ""Betsy Ross"" flag. But we quickly decided that someone should be us, and quickly got to work. We designed our shoe that features the flag. We want these shoes to be available to people who want them to be the symbol of what they really are. A symbol of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We aren't trying to become corporate giants and take over the shoe biz. We just want to make these shoes available to set things straight. But making shoes like this at an affordable price requires minimum orders, and we don't have a million dollar business to get things started. We're just regular guys who need fellow patriots to help us make the order. </li>
<li>Pledging to this campaign will get you a pair of the shoes we're trying to produce and help make them available through other retail outlets once we have a supply  </li>
<li><p>We can make as many as we have to, if we get enough to make the minimum.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you agree with us and our point of view regarding the flag, and not the corporate giant, show the world by getting these shoes!</li>
<li>Celebrate what makes this nation great! Celebrate that which unites us, not divides us</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>The first pair of shoes has already been made, but minimum orders need to be met to make them available.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We have some pledges available other than getting shoes for those of you who want to help but aren't really worried about shoes. But really, it's about getting the shoes out there to prove they should have just been released in the first place.</p>

Before that could happen, the shoes were canceled at the advice of one of the companies spokes people (we won't say who, but it was a former pro quarterback who's been in the news for more than football) who called flag was a symbol of racism. The reasoning being that the flag was created at a time slavery existed in what would become our nation. But, that would mean EVERYTHING from that period of history is a symbol of racism. Slavery wasn't a the reason the flag was created. The flag was created to be a symbol of the revolution being fought to create a new nation. Slavery was not a motivation for fighting the revolution. The revolution was fought to create a nation where ""all men are created equal"", even if it took more time to realize that vision. Nothing on the flag represents slavery. A journalist wrote at the time ""The stars were disposed in a circle, symbolizing the perpetuity of the Union; the ring, like the circling serpent of the Egyptians, signifying eternity. The thirteen stripes showed with the stars the number of the United Colonies, and denoted the subordination of the States to the Union, as well as equality among themselves."" and Charles Thomson, former Secretary of the Continental Congress, wrote to the new Congress ""The colours of the pales are those used in the flag of the United States of America. White signifies purity and innocence. Red hardiness and valour and Blue the colour of the Chief signifies vigilance perseverance and justice.""As patriots and lovers of American history, we were dumbfounded when we heard why the shoes would not become available for sale. At first we joked someone should make their shoes with the ""Betsy Ross"" flag. But we quickly decided that someone should be us, and quickly got to work. We designed our shoe that features the flag. We want these shoes to be available to people who want them to be the symbol of what they really are. A symbol of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!

What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

We aren't trying to become corporate giants and take over the shoe biz. We just want to make these shoes available to set things straight. But making shoes like this at an affordable price requires minimum orders, and we don't have a million dollar business to get things started. We're just regular guys who need fellow patriots to help us make the order. 
Pledging to this campaign will get you a pair of the shoes we're trying to produce and help make them available through other retail outlets once we have a supply  
We can make as many as we have to, if we get enough to make the minimum.


The Impact
Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:

If you agree with us and our point of view regarding the flag, and not the corporate giant, show the world by getting these shoes!
Celebrate what makes this nation great! Celebrate that which unites us, not divides us


Risks & Challenges
The first pair of shoes has already been made, but minimum orders need to be met to make them available.

Other Ways You Can Help
We have some pledges available other than getting shoes for those of you who want to help but aren't really worried about shoes. But really, it's about getting the shoes out there to prove they should have just been released in the first place.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>SWITCH TO SILK</p>
<p>Mom(me)’s The Word </p>
<p>Momme weight in the silk world is thread count in the cotton world. Did you know, most silk pillowcases and products available on the market today are usually only 19 – 22 momme? Morning Face has a whopping 25 momme weight, and so the difference is like going from 250 thread count sheets, to 1000 thread count Egyptian cotton. The highest quality silk we could find, Morning Face is luxurious and longer lasting.</p>

<p>Who said that dressing well means to be identical? Why renouncing to a personal touch at work? Why not being always yourself, every day and in every occasion?</p>
<p>We answered these questions by designing some accessories that become part of any outfit, completing and enriching it with personality. They will become absolutely indispensable.</p>
<p><b>What day would it be without a Lennoc?</b></p>
<span style=""font-size: smaller;"">
<p>Perché vestirsi bene vuol dire essere uguali? Perché rinunciare a un tocco personale sul lavoro? Perché non essere sempre, ogni giorno, in ogni occasione, semplicemente te stesso?</p>
<p>La nostra risposta è stata immaginare alcuni accessori che diventano parte di ogni outfit, completandolo e arricchendolo di personalità. Diventeranno assolutamente irrinunciabili.</p>

<p>All of our products are made using the finest materials and natural fabrics, such as wood fabric and cork fabric, combined with precious silks and cashmere.</p>
<p>The idea of this original union originated from the desire to unite tradition and innovation, drawing inspiration from our land and our maternal grandmother’s creativity in tailoring ceremony dresses.</p>
<p>Cork is a real fabric, which maintains its natural colors and remains soft and smooth to the touch. The proposed match with precious silk makes our accessories unique and memorable. All of our products are handcrafted and Made in Italy.</p>

<span style=""font-size: smaller;""><p>Tutti i nostri prodotti nascono da materiali pregiati e tessuti naturali, come il tessuto di legno e il tessuto di sughero ai quali vengono abbinate pregiate sete e cashmere. L’idea di questa originale unione è nata dalla voglia di coniugare innovazione e tradizione, traendo ispirazione dal territorio locale e dalla grande creatività della nostra nonna materna nel confezionare abiti da cerimonia.</p></span>
<span style=""font-size: smaller;""><p>Il sughero è un vero e proprio tessuto, che conserva i suoi colori naturali, rimanendo morbido e liscio al tatto.

<p>We love to imagine our accessories all-round, involving packaging too in the creation process to enhance the pleasure of using them. We love inserting echoes of our land, Calabria, in our products, making them more valuable and representative of this land potentiality.</p>
<p>Bergamot is a precious and world-renowned citrus fruit thriving in our coastal areas: we created an authentic emotional path, using its peel directly in the packaging of our products, especially in weekly packs.</p>
<p></p>

<span style=""font-size: smaller;""><p>Ci piace l’idea di pensare agli accessori a tutto tondo, coinvolgendo anche il packaging nel processo di creazione e nel piacere della fruizione dell’oggetto stesso. Ci piace l’idea di inserire echi della nostra terra, la Calabria, nei nostri prodotti, valorizzandoli e facendoli portatori delle potenzialità di questo territorio.</p>
<p>Il nostro valore aggiunto è l’impiego attivo del bergamotto, un agrume pregiato e conosciuto in tutto il mondo, ma che proprio sulle nostre coste cresce rigoglioso.</p></span>

</div></div>","Differenziati da tutti. Indossa te stesso. Scegli un Lennoc per dire chi sei.
Who said that dressing well means to be identical? Why renouncing to a personal touch at work? Why not being always yourself, every day and in every occasion?
We answered these questions by designing some accessories that become part of any outfit, completing and enriching it with personality. They will become absolutely indispensable.
What day would it be without a Lennoc?

Perché vestirsi bene vuol dire essere uguali? Perché rinunciare a un tocco personale sul lavoro? Perché non essere sempre, ogni giorno, in ogni occasione, semplicemente te stesso?
La nostra risposta è stata immaginare alcuni accessori che diventano parte di ogni outfit, completandolo e arricchendolo di personalità. Diventeranno assolutamente irrinunciabili.
Che giorno è senza un Lennoc?





All of our products are made using the finest materials and natural fabrics, such as wood fabric and cork fabric, combined with precious silks and cashmere.
The idea of this original union originated from the desire to unite tradition and innovation, drawing inspiration from our land and our maternal grandmother’s creativity in tailoring ceremony dresses.
Cork is a real fabric, which maintains its natural colors and remains soft and smooth to the touch. The proposed match with precious silk makes our accessories unique and memorable. All of our products are handcrafted and Made in Italy.

Tutti i nostri prodotti nascono da materiali pregiati e tessuti naturali, come il tessuto di legno e il tessuto di sughero ai quali vengono abbinate pregiate sete e cashmere. L’idea di questa originale unione è nata dalla voglia di coniugare innovazione e tradizione, traendo ispirazione dal territorio locale e dalla grande creatività della nostra nonna materna nel confezionare abiti da cerimonia.
Il sughero è un vero e proprio tessuto, che conserva i suoi colori naturali, rimanendo morbido e liscio al tatto. L’abbinamento che qui proponiamo con pregiata seta rende i nostri accessori unici e indimenticabili. Tutti i nostri prodotti sono artigianali, e rigorosamente Made in Italy.



We love to imagine our accessories all-round, involving packaging too in the creation process to enhance the pleasure of using them. We love inserting echoes of our land, Calabria, in our products, making them more valuable and representative of this land potentiality.
Bergamot is a precious and world-renowned citrus fruit thriving in our coastal areas: we created an authentic emotional path, using its peel directly in the packaging of our products, especially in weekly packs.


 That way, opening the package is a hymn to life: the tactile feeling of an authentic handcrafted box, the visual excitement coming from the evocative power of the union of unusual and precious fabrics, the olfactory emotion aroused by the light bergamot scent.

Ci piace l’idea di pensare agli accessori a tutto tondo, coinvolgendo anche il packaging nel processo di creazione e nel piacere della fruizione dell’oggetto stesso. Ci piace l’idea di inserire echi della nostra terra, la Calabria, nei nostri prodotti, valorizzandoli e facendoli portatori delle potenzialità di questo territorio.
Il nostro valore aggiunto è l’impiego attivo del bergamotto, un agrume pregiato e conosciuto in tutto il mondo, ma che proprio sulle nostre coste cresce rigoglioso.

Abbiamo creato un vero percorso emozionale, utilizzando la buccia di questo agrume, direttamente nel packaging dei nostri prodotti, in particolare nelle confezioni settimanali. In questo modo aprire i nostri prodotti è un inno alla vita: l’emozione tattile di uno scatolo artigianale, visiva per il potere evocativo dell’unione di tessuti insoliti e pregiati, olfattiva per il sottile aroma diffuso dal bergamotto.


Lennoc
Literally “la
nnocca”, that is “ribbon” in Calabrian dialect. An ironic and refined accessory that allows to personalize and to make fascinating even the simplest look. They are crafted using cork or silk, to fit any style.
With the
cork-made Lennoc, the temptation is always the same… to have them all!

Letteralmente “la nnocca”, che in calabrese significa fiocco. E’ un accessorio ironico e raffinato al contempo che permette di personalizzare e rendere intrigante anche il più semplice dei look.

Vengono realizzati in sughero o in seta, per adattarsi ad ogni stile.
Con i Lennoc in sughero, la tentazione è sempre la stessa... prenderli tutti!







The button sewn
on the backside allows you to position this mini bow tie in your jacket and
shirt buttonholes.

Il bottone cucito sul retro permette di posizionare questo mini papillon nelle asole delle vostre giacche o camicie.

Modern, original, precious, handcrafted… There it is
the Lennoc!

Moderno, originale, pregiato, artigianale... ecco a voi il Lennoc!


Opuntia



The Lennoc… for her. Named after the prickly pear flower, it is an original accessory to embellish any outfit.
The manufacture is sartorial, made by skillful hands using silks with different weaves and colors.
La versione femminile del Lennoc. Il nome è quello del fiore del fico d’india, per un accessorio originale che impreziosirà ogni mise.  La manifattura è sartoriale, realizzata in seta da mani sapienti in diverse trame e colori.



Similarly to Lennoc, it can be buttoned to jackets and shirts buttonholes, to make your look unique and precious.

Come il Lennoc, si può abbottonare alle asole di giacche e camice, per impreziosire e rendere davvero unico ogni look.



…And you, what is your Opuntia?

E tu, di che Opuntia sei?




Pasuse
It is the
acronym for “papillon” (bow tie), “sughero” (cork) and “seta” (silk). Striking,
it is the perfect choice for people who want to leave their mark.
Pasuse è l’acronimo di papillion sughero e seta. Di grande impatto è perfetto per chi ama lasciare il segno.



Distinctive features? Posh!
Segni particolari? Elegantissimo!



The only problem with the Pasuse is that
you won’t be able to do without it.



L'unico problema con il Pasuse è che non riuscirai più a farne a meno!



DREAMING REALITY | Sognando la realtà
Our purpose is to reach the minimum amount of 10.000 Euro. This money will be used to establish our company and to go into production, buying the raw material we need to craft all the proposed products.
Reaching the minimum sum will give us the greatest chance of our lives: founding a business in the land we love, Calabria. We would like to prove that it is not necessary to leave in order to create something. 
Any amount above the minimum sum will be welcome, since it will help us to better manage the entire operation.

...and then?



Il nostro obiettivo è raggiungere la cifra minima di 10.000 euro. Con questi soldi potremo fondare la nostra azienda e andare in produzione, acquistando le materie prime che ci occorrono per realizzare tutti prodotti che vi abbiamo proposto.
Qualsiasi cifra sopra la quota minima sarà la benvenuta perché ci consentirà di gestire al meglio tutta l’operazione, ma almeno la possibilità di raggiungere la nostra quota base ci darà la più grande occasione della vita: iniziare la nostra attività nella terra che amiamo, la Calabria. Ci piacerebbe dimostrare che non è necessario andar via per creare qualcosa.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been wanting to start an automotive club for a long time; I tried in 2017 &amp; failed. So I tried again learning from my past mistakes and challenges and created LAME AF in 2020 with four friends. We have successfully launched a full scale show back in October of 2020 with over 800 attendee's and we want to do a lot more in the future. But, we decided that we also want to make ourselves a brand. A brand with a fun background and cool designs for shirts, and stickers and much more! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Currently we have a small supply of merchandise left from our first show; but they're all of our original ideas and concepts. We have been able to introduce 5 new slap stickers into our line up earlier in February; but we want to start producing these new shirt concepts as well as new sticker slap designs. </p>
<ul>
<li>To purchase roughly 100 shirts, we need an estimated $900</li>
<li>To purchase 100 new slaps with four new designs, we need $300</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The idea of LAME AF Clothing Co &amp; Car Club is to build a better working relationship with the community &amp; local law enforcement. Most car clubs are frowned upon unless they're from a classic car club. So we want to be able to build brand awareness and show that we care about the community we are apart of here in Wisconsin and the Green Bay &amp; Appleton area. </p>
<ul>
<li>We successfully raised over 50 canned goods &amp; over a dozen of toys in our last drive. </li>
<li>We want to be able to give back to the community; so with the more money we have the larger types of events we are able to host in order to give back to the community around us. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently the biggest huddle we face is the ability to get a lot of traction. We have attended several large shows and have boothed, which means to sell our merchandise there; and we are slowly building up our name! It just takes time; each time we go to a show and booth, more people begin to know who we are! So our biggest challenge is time and awareness. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The biggest way you can help out if you can't donate is to go to our Facebook Page &amp; our Instagram page and share our pictures! We post to Instagram once a day Monday-Friday, we keep our story active on the weekends, and we try to post to Facebook more than once or twice a day! </p>

After we couldn’t find what we were looking for, we decided to make them ourselves.
This collection features classic designs, comfortable styles and quality materials that are sustainable and durable.
Our action for sustainability is grounded in respect for our natural environment.
We want to move away from fast fashion, developing sunglasses that are designed to last.
 





 
We have designed a range of classic styles, working with the best suppliers in the world to craft them. We use the highest quality, sustainable new and recycled materials we can source.
 
We have developed an initial collection of 2 classic unisex styles.
 
Each style is available in 3 different iconic colorways, with 2 lens color options.
 

 

 
Our talented design team has spent many hours refining and perfecting our designs, ensuring that our sunglasses are stylish, comfortable and complement every face.
We were inspired by iconic styles, making subtle updates to bring them into the modern era.
We have spent the past few months working with leading manufacturers and suppliers to bring prototypes to life.
The final result is a timeless and comfortable collection.

 

 

 
 

 

 
We have worked with the best suppliers from all over the world to ensure that your new sunglasses are made from most sustainable, eco-friendly materials where possible.
 
We’re proud of the quality of the raw eco-materials that are cut, polished and shaped into a pair of VARDIER sunglasses.

Frames are cut and crafted from premium cellulose acetate sourced from Castiglione Olona in Italy, produced by the worldwide manufacturing leader and family company Mazzucchelli 1849 S.p.A.Cellulose acetate is known for being strong, lightweight, and flexible.It also has the widest range for transparency, rich colors, and finishes, and is hand polished and assembled into your VARDIER frame.We offer 3 frame colorways in each style.Lenses are produced specially for VARDIER by the internationally leading manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, founded in Jena, Germany in 1846.They are rated category 3 - UV400, and will protect you against 100% of solar UVA and UVB radiation.The most versatile lens colors were grey and green, providing optimum general purpose use, good contrast for low-light conditions, even and true color perception and reduction of eye fatigue.Each style is available with both lens colors. They also feature a laser-etched VRDR (VARDIER) logo.

instead of single-use plastic cups, non-plastic straws, eco-friendly market bags over plastic bags and so on.I agree with the idea of #zerowaste movement, and it would be very pleasant to see more people try to waste less.As I am a bag maker, I wanted to do something about #zerowaste.  But, I did not want to be another eco-friendly market bag maker since there are plenty of them already. EncounterOne day, I found a pair of old glasses in my drawer which I don't wear because of too many scratches on the lens surface.   If I were careful enough, I would still wear them until now, instead of getting a new pair.Some of my friends have the same issue, and others don't.  If your eyes are sensitive to those scratches and your vision feels a bit blurred, you would replace them with new ones. Because a blurred vision is not helpful when you want to focus on your work.If you want lenses made with real glass, it would not be a problem.  However, plastic lenses are far more practical than real glass.  It doesn't shatter like glass, is easy to shape and weighs much less than real glass.  As long as we use plastic lenses, scratches are inevitable.   QuestionHow can I extend the life cycle of lenses? Another word, how can I keep my lenses scratch-free at minimal cost? If it's too expensive, why bother. ProblemsMost of the scratches are due to the poor choice of cleaning method.Here are some examples.The best way to clean lenses is to use the microfiber cleaning cloth that comes with a new pair of glasses.  ""However, they are not available to you when you need. "" It's not your fault.  You were out of options.  That's why you had to use t-shirts to clean your lenses.  Expressway to scratch land. ResearchI asked around why people have a hard time to carry that cloth, even though they know it's the best cleaning material for the eyewear lenses. 1) Collects DustDue to the nature of the surface structure, it collects dust and debris very well.  You can't carry it alone.  You need a sort of pouch. 2) Nobody likes foldingIn order to put it in a pouch, you need to fold it.  Who has time for folding such a tiny piece of fabric?  And, taking it out of pouch is also troublesome. 3) The Eyewear ContainerIt seems OK to use.  It keeps the cloth away from dust and taking out and restoring action was not that troublesome.  However, it's too bulky to carry around. Solution1) We need a pouch which does not take much space.2)Taking out and restoring action should be seamless.3) It should look good to carry.  Your style is very important to us.4) Affordability.  Can't emphasize enough of that because you need more than one to keep them around you all the time.  Your office desk, home, car, and your bag deserve one respectively.If it's easy enough to use and becomes part of your daily life, you could extend the life cycle of lenses and waste less.   You could save money, too.   Those prescription lenses are expensive. Very much. After many sketches and samples...GOPOD was born.  GOPODIt's an easy to use storage pod for a Microfiber Fabric for cleaning glasses & lenses with a built-in retractable pull and follows you wherever you go. How does 'GOPOD' work? 1) Pick up the 'GOPOD', then release the cord with metal tab.  2) Squeeze the pod a little bit to widen the opening and grab the cloth with your fingers. 3) Pull the cloth all the way back. 4) Clean your glasses thoroughly  5) Pull the metal tab all the way back.  It will restore the cloth in a second.  Literally. 6) Restore the pull 7) Voila.  Enjoy your brighter vision  You can watch the whole cleaning process in the following video.    Benefits from 'GOPOD' 1) Better Vision, Better Focus<Photo by Petr Sevcovic >It is obvious.  If there are too many scratches on the lens surface, things will look a bit blurred.  Eventually, you'll get a headache and feel tired. 2) Protect your investmentI've spent an average of $150 just for the prescription lenses.  They are not cheap. If you take 'GOPOD' everywhere and clean lenses with the microfiber cleaning cloth, you may save a few hundred bucks in years.If you have high-end camera lenses, you could save more.  <Photo by Jakob Owens > <Photo by ShareGrid > Always use a microfiber product to clean optical lenses.  If it's not around...""We Recommend GOPOD"" <Photo by Jay Wennington>Who knows?  You may get a chance to enjoy a fine dining with the savings. 3) Looking GoodThis classical design makes GOPOD as fashion accessories. <Photo by Zahir Namane >If you are a suit guy, perfecto. It fits into your pocket.  And, nobody will notice. <Photo by Debora Cardenas>Not to mention those beautiful ladies with pretty handbags. <Photo by Csaba Balazs>Tech boy? You are my guy, too.  <Photo by Justin Main>Photographer?  Please. Come on.  You definitely need GOPODs. 4) Waste LessLonger lens lifecycle guarantees less waste.  Then, mother nature will pay you back with less microplastic filled fishes.  What goes around comes around.  AffordableSo you can get a bunch.We want you to feel secure wherever you go when it comes to cleaning lenses. They should be available to you when you need.  That is why affordability is so important to us.  GOPOD will retail for $9.   In this campaign, however, you can get up to 55% discount ( only for first 200 backers )It's $4 for each GOPOD.  Go get'em tiger! Just keep them in following locations.  Make them available to you all the time.<Places you want to keep GOPODs > GOPOD Features 1) High-quality Vegan LeatherOK.  Vegan Leather is just a nicer way to call the synthetic or man-made faux leather. However, our vegan leather feels really good and the texture looks so real.  Even the wrong side of the leather has real suede-like texture.  And, no animal was harmed.  It's made of PVC. 2) Drawstring made with high-quality bungee cordThis cord is made for the professional climbing gear.  It will last longer.  Much longer than you expect. 3) Weight is only 25g or 0.9 ozIt is so light.  You won't recognize it's in your pocket or bag.  4) Fits into your palmThe size would be 2""x 4.5"" and the thickness 0.5"" approx.    5) Replaceable cleaning cloth You can wash it or replace with a new one when it becomes unusable.GOPOD comes with one microfiber cleaning cloth, but you may have many of them already.You can also use them, too.   Just make a hole about 1mm diameter in the middle of the cloth, and penetrate it with the bolt and screw back into the rivet.  You are all set.<Photo by wilhei>An awl is a perfect tool to make a hole.  You may use a perforating tool for leathercraft, too. The pre-punched cleaning cloth is available when you check out.  Look for add-ons. 6) Various Color OptionsGOPOD comes with 5 colors.     Hello,  I am Donni  We have a small shop for handmade bags in Busan. A beautiful harbor city in South Korea.  It's called ALLOPEBBLE and we make bags like below. Your orders will be made with exceptional quality.Yes.  They will be made in Korea, not anywhere else.  Timeline  You may get your perks around mid-October. Sounds good?  <Photo by Jesse ramirez> Perks      If you feel like you need more cleaning cloths, you can add them to your order before you check out.  Our cleaning cloth is made of premium microfiber fabric and it is thicker than the one you got for free when you buy a pair of glasses.  Also, it is pre-punched in the middle for future installation.    Is it available other than Indiegogo?Nope.  This is our first time to introduce GOPOD.   If you watched the video clip above, it says at the end...    <Photo Credit for the promotion video> Brunel Johnson / Jasmin Sessler  / Alex Iby /  Nadine Shaabana / Pixabay",42.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>It started in mid-2015 by a group of youth who took interest in high-end watches and had a will to create high-quality watches, wanting giving total exclusivity to the community yet with an affordable price tag. The concept is to create a breakthrough in design with an exclusive feel to it. After attempts and research of watches, art, design, material, and with our own encounters with communities, now we present our Masterpiece under the name Elgis Watch, divided into two series Wilwatikta I and Wilwatikta II. So What we need is your support to get this project into production phase.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the making of design, we got a big question, ""can we create watch design from an ancient heritage that suits modern looks?"" that is quite challenging yet tempting to us. Finally, we found the answer is to create a breakthrough that brought back an ancient heritage art that is inherited by WILWATIKTA (MAJAPAHIT) empire.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489778058/miqennh427ztn8eiicyj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>WILWATIKTA (Sanskrit name of Majapahit Empire) whose reign from 1350 to 1389 was marked by conquest which extended through Southeast Asia is inherit a lot of artifacts, works of art, and also a great story about the kingdom that describes strength and masculinity of the king. Until now WILWATIKTA considered the strongest kingdom in Southeast Asia. We believe by making watches with this design it's not just the watch that tells the time but art on your wrist that had an emotional bond.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">After 6 months of research and design process, we move to the next step, making the 3D CAD to visualize the concept with precise measurement</p>

<p>Instead of injection molding, we choose the CNC Milling process to preserve a high accuracy case shape. On the finish, CNC Milling has offered better quality since a tighter tolerance can be held and a better surface finish can be obtained.The only disadvantage for milling is that every part has lots of machining time thus resulting in higher cost prices and take time. But for high quality watches the price is secondary to the quality of the end product.</p>

<p>The classic WILWATIKTA II is a perfect company to your wrist by adding character and vintage look. A trademark patina, the CuSn8 bronze becomes darker and more discolored over time due to body heat, humidity, and climatic factor. It's all about to make it individual. We complete the elegance of the bronze material with gray signature ""WILWATIKTA"" dial and gray nubuck leather strap to match the aesthetic. We choose a Miyota 9015 movement, a desire for every watch lovers. No doubt, it is individual.</p>

It started in mid-2015 by a group of youth who took interest in high-end watches and had a will to create high-quality watches, wanting giving total exclusivity to the community yet with an affordable price tag. The concept is to create a breakthrough in design with an exclusive feel to it. After attempts and research of watches, art, design, material, and with our own encounters with communities, now we present our Masterpiece under the name Elgis Watch, divided into two series Wilwatikta I and Wilwatikta II. So What we need is your support to get this project into production phase.

 
In the making of design, we got a big question, ""can we create watch design from an ancient heritage that suits modern looks?"" that is quite challenging yet tempting to us. Finally, we found the answer is to create a breakthrough that brought back an ancient heritage art that is inherited by WILWATIKTA (MAJAPAHIT) empire.

WILWATIKTA (Sanskrit name of Majapahit Empire) whose reign from 1350 to 1389 was marked by conquest which extended through Southeast Asia is inherit a lot of artifacts, works of art, and also a great story about the kingdom that describes strength and masculinity of the king. Until now WILWATIKTA considered the strongest kingdom in Southeast Asia. We believe by making watches with this design it's not just the watch that tells the time but art on your wrist that had an emotional bond.
 

Big thing starts from scratch, it was the time when we draft the initial design to get the perfect design proportion.

The dial design is a combination of Majapahit symbol and the art (Artefact, Statue) that inherent by WILWATIKTA ( Majapahit) Empire.

 
After 6 months of research and design process, we move to the next step, making the 3D CAD to visualize the concept with precise measurement

but 3D CAD is not enough, to make sure the design is perfect and comfortable to use we create several dummies with 3Dprinter. We studied numerous 3D-printed models to make sure we have the best model with the best ergonomic fit. 

Instead of injection molding, we choose the CNC Milling process to preserve a high accuracy case shape. On the finish, CNC Milling has offered better quality since a tighter tolerance can be held and a better surface finish can be obtained.The only disadvantage for milling is that every part has lots of machining time thus resulting in higher cost prices and take time. But for high quality watches the price is secondary to the quality of the end product.


For the material, we concern about its durability, toughness, and ergonomic.Stainless steel 316L and Cusn8 Bronze, both are the timeless material over the world.finally, the product is hand polished to create two different polish brush finish and mirror finish. 


WE PRESENT WILWATIKTA I AND WILWATIKTA II 

 
The sleek WILWATIKTA I is dedicated to all dress watch enthusiast who wants to add distinct cultural value to the watch, rather than a plain conventional design. The uniqueness of the dial and the 316l stainless case would balance every formal occasion. WILWATIKTA I would also stand out in casual wear with its contrast dial-marker and bold hands. The silver curvy case design is the symbol of versatility and uniqueness. By having Miyota 9015 movement and authentic engraved dial, WILWATIKTA I is ready to be your wrist partner in any occasion.




 

 
The classic WILWATIKTA II is a perfect company to your wrist by adding character and vintage look. A trademark patina, the CuSn8 bronze becomes darker and more discolored over time due to body heat, humidity, and climatic factor. It's all about to make it individual. We complete the elegance of the bronze material with gray signature ""WILWATIKTA"" dial and gray nubuck leather strap to match the aesthetic. We choose a Miyota 9015 movement, a desire for every watch lovers. No doubt, it is individual.




 

 


 

Movement is the most important part to watches, we choose Miyota 9015 because of its accuracy and durability. You can still wound the movement like the manual hand winding and it has hacking feature.


 
In order to pursue total exclusivity, we will ship the watches with solid wood watch box.

<p> </p>
<p>Dear friend, </p>
<p>I can recall a time when, as a little boy, I was lying on the grass on a sunny afternoon looking at the clouds changing shape in front of my very eyes. I can recall a time when my friend and I were playing in the woods – we thought we were soldiers, or cops, or super heroes. We could play for hours and we never saw the time fly away as we had so much fun.</p>
<p>I can recall a time when we were playing a game called “tag BBQ”. The goal was simple: touch a girl and get kissed. Then, when she’s “touched” she runs after boys to get kissed which was cool when you were “the chosen one”. I still remember the joy I felt when I succeeded beautifully.</p>
<p>The World and the Universe seemed so much of a fun place back then. All was to explore. All was to enjoy. All was so beautiful. Everything seemed so friendly.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501086908/ajdjzgetqg0llhm8tfh9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I can’t remember exactly when this “joie de vivre” disappeared but it happened. Year after year, day after day, I had less and less until I got so low I felt like if I had a rusted knife in my heart and some obscure power was twisting it slowly. Haven’t you questioned yourself to the point you are wondering why you are living? I don’t want this message to be another sob story but it gets better. Hang on.</p>
<p>From elementary school right to my short lived corporate job career, I felt like I was stuck in a vise and all that was surrounding me was crushing, molding, and bending me to get and fit into a life that wasn’t mine.</p>
<p>One day, a friend gave me a book I “had to read”. This book had supposedly changed his life even though he looked exactly the same. I didn’t know who the author was or what I would find in the book. Sure I would find some secret from people whom I despised or I thought were in a special league I would never be a part of.</p>
<p>As a was reading the book a little short five-word sentence caught my attention: “Your Only Limit Is You”.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501087297/j5ifneyl4fwyrmwjpav4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I was mesmerized at first but then I felt like I’ve been godded new powers. For the first time in years, I could still feel like when I was a little boy playing in the woods or running after girls for a kiss.</p>
<p>I knew it was okay to be who I was. That I could be unique and different and that I should accept myself. I knew it was okay to have dreams. I knew I was in total control of my life. Everything shifted from impossibilities to the realm of possibilities. I knew I was entitled to greatness and all begins with me. I felt like I was limitless.</p>
<p>My life didn’t turn around in a blink of an eye. I didn’t buy a Lamborghini the next day or a mansion in the Hollywood Hills, or received hundreds of SMS from Gisele Bundchen and Jessica Chastain. At least, “Your Only Limit Is You” gave me the courage to begin my long journey.</p>
<p>“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” –Laozi</p>
<p>Today, we - Pier-Luc and myself (Simon) - are doing a crowdfunding campaign to fund a new breathtaking clothing brand that could possibly change the World. This brand is a tribute to the individualists who are craving to make their inner desires a reality because <u>life's too short to be insignificant</u>.</p>
<p>Here are our t-shirts :</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>YOUR ONLY LIMIT IS YOU</b></p>
<p>The phrase that was the starting point for me. The key that unlocked my true self and gave me “la force” to be who I wanted to be or be the real me. You are your only limit after all.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>YOU ARE LIMITLESS</b></p>
<p>Simple but to the point. The “limitless” t-shirt means that you are limitless. You are born with an unlimited potential. Thus, the “limitless” t-shirt symbolizes your understanding about the psychology behind every great undertaking that put a dent in the Universe.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</b></p>
<p>Yes … knowledge is power. This t-shirt could have been “<u>Applied</u> Knowledge Is Power”. It is one thing to know something, but it is another to apply it. It is one thing to read self-help books and it is another to apply what you just read.</p>
<p>“Knowledge Is Power” is for the gentlemen who understood the role and importance of knowledge and information in his life. He knows it gives him the edge over mediocrity and the tools to reinvent himself at will.</p>

<p>When you wear a Brass &amp; Metti t-shirt it is because you abide by this philosophy - you are not a brainwashed drone. You are in the same crew as all the people who chose to believe in themselves, to embrace life and to make it a “chef d’oeuvre”. You just happened to say no to the scripted life and mediocrity.</p>

<p>Brass &amp; Metti is born from our relentless desire to find versatile, high quality and good looking t-shirts that promote a positive message. Most empowering tees sold on the market today are cheap and poorly made. Plus, they are designed for gym freaks. We just came up with our own answer - Brass &amp; Metti clothes to empower the soul.</p>
<p>These luxe t-shirts have seen the rise of the sun because we believe that life's too short to be insignificant. We believe in thinking differently. We believe in breaking the status quo. We believe that it is better to be a sheepherder than a sheep. We believe that you are limitless. Thus, we fashioned a t-shirt made from the finest materials that will last for years to come that represents the philosophy we abide to. So, we just happened to create the world's most empowering t-shirts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501789550/tw0kpy59ubbcm0l4f6ji.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brass &amp; Metti t-shirts hold a story. It hides in the seams and whispers from the fold. Each t-shirt has been designed with an obsessive attention to details like an alchemist brewing a concoction in his laboratory.</p>
<p>Each premium top is fashioned from sun baking cotton adroitly chosen by a skillful artisan. That fabric provides a magnificent fit that underlines the most beautiful curves of your silhouette as well as providing a velvety-comfy and smooth comfort like a sweet caress from an angel ascended from the sky. The robust seams and pre-shrunk textile promote an abiding durability and appearance for years to come.</p>
<p>You can trust us when we say you’ll get the same quality offered by the most prestigious clothing labels like Dolce &amp; Gabanna, Gucci, Diesel &amp; Ralph Lauren for example.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Most empowering tees sold on the market today are for a particular clientele - gym freaks. The main goal with Brass &amp; Metti was to create a versatile piece of clothing that you can wear anytime anywhere.</p>
<p>Going to the gym is good for your health and should be part of anyone's routine. What if you could bring those positive or empowering quotes anywhere you go instead - not only in the gym. This is why we chose to focus on very simplistic and modern designs. You can wear your luxe t-shirt to the bar, in a nightclub, on a date, on the beach, at the office, etc.</p>
<p>Show the world what you stand for anytime and anywhere.</p>

<p>Thus, to congratulate and to thank you for your immense support, we chose to give you something amazing - a sample of our new men's cologne ""outsideofthebox” - a 100% free gift from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
<p>We’ve put months into the making of that little beauty. It's no ordinary perfume. It is a perfect essential oil mixture that ignites the olfactory system in a dramatic way . In fact, if no one comes to ask you what's that smell, #1 - you might be alone in your house, or #2 - you probably forgot to put some.</p>
<p>We promise that this special run of perfume will leave no one indifferent. Hey, it can be a good opener in a bar:</p>
<p><i>""Woman, can you tell me if that smells good?”</i>, you said confidently.</p>
<p><i>""Yeah, sure! You smell like I would like take you home and</i> [blank]<i>""</i>, she replied.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this Indiegogo campaign is not a dating course my friend. Just remember that we add a sample or our “parfum fabuleux” with your order - whatever the number of t-shirts you order. How cool is that?</p>

</div></div>","Dear friend, 
I can recall a time when, as a little boy, I was lying on the grass on a sunny afternoon looking at the clouds changing shape in front of my very eyes. I can recall a time when my friend and I were playing in the woods – we thought we were soldiers, or cops, or super heroes. We could play for hours and we never saw the time fly away as we had so much fun.
I can recall a time when we were playing a game called “tag BBQ”. The goal was simple: touch a girl and get kissed. Then, when she’s “touched” she runs after boys to get kissed which was cool when you were “the chosen one”. I still remember the joy I felt when I succeeded beautifully.
The World and the Universe seemed so much of a fun place back then. All was to explore. All was to enjoy. All was so beautiful. Everything seemed so friendly.

I can’t remember exactly when this “joie de vivre” disappeared but it happened. Year after year, day after day, I had less and less until I got so low I felt like if I had a rusted knife in my heart and some obscure power was twisting it slowly. Haven’t you questioned yourself to the point you are wondering why you are living? I don’t want this message to be another sob story but it gets better. Hang on.
From elementary school right to my short lived corporate job career, I felt like I was stuck in a vise and all that was surrounding me was crushing, molding, and bending me to get and fit into a life that wasn’t mine.
One day, a friend gave me a book I “had to read”. This book had supposedly changed his life even though he looked exactly the same. I didn’t know who the author was or what I would find in the book. Sure I would find some secret from people whom I despised or I thought were in a special league I would never be a part of.
As a was reading the book a little short five-word sentence caught my attention: “Your Only Limit Is You”.

I was mesmerized at first but then I felt like I’ve been godded new powers. For the first time in years, I could still feel like when I was a little boy playing in the woods or running after girls for a kiss.
I knew it was okay to be who I was. That I could be unique and different and that I should accept myself. I knew it was okay to have dreams. I knew I was in total control of my life. Everything shifted from impossibilities to the realm of possibilities. I knew I was entitled to greatness and all begins with me. I felt like I was limitless.
My life didn’t turn around in a blink of an eye. I didn’t buy a Lamborghini the next day or a mansion in the Hollywood Hills, or received hundreds of SMS from Gisele Bundchen and Jessica Chastain. At least, “Your Only Limit Is You” gave me the courage to begin my long journey.
“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” –Laozi
Today, we - Pier-Luc and myself (Simon) - are doing a crowdfunding campaign to fund a new breathtaking clothing brand that could possibly change the World. This brand is a tribute to the individualists who are craving to make their inner desires a reality because life's too short to be insignificant.
Here are our t-shirts :
 

YOUR ONLY LIMIT IS YOU
The phrase that was the starting point for me. The key that unlocked my true self and gave me “la force” to be who I wanted to be or be the real me. You are your only limit after all.
 

YOU ARE LIMITLESS
Simple but to the point. The “limitless” t-shirt means that you are limitless. You are born with an unlimited potential. Thus, the “limitless” t-shirt symbolizes your understanding about the psychology behind every great undertaking that put a dent in the Universe.
 

YOU ARE LIMITLESS ... REALLY
“Whether you think you can, or you think you can't - you're right.” –Henry Ford
 

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER
Yes … knowledge is power. This t-shirt could have been “Applied Knowledge Is Power”. It is one thing to know something, but it is another to apply it. It is one thing to read self-help books and it is another to apply what you just read.
“Knowledge Is Power” is for the gentlemen who understood the role and importance of knowledge and information in his life. He knows it gives him the edge over mediocrity and the tools to reinvent himself at will.
 

DO YOU BELONG TO THE COMMUNITY?
What is the purpose of having “Brass & Metti” emblazoned on your t-shirt? Well, Brass & Metti is a tribute to the individualists who are craving to make their inner desires a reality because life’s too short to be insignificant.
When you wear a Brass & Metti t-shirt it is because you abide by this philosophy - you are not a brainwashed drone. You are in the same crew as all the people who chose to believe in themselves, to embrace life and to make it a “chef d’oeuvre”. You just happened to say no to the scripted life and mediocrity.
You represent all what human beings should strive to achieve : Greatness. 


Back this project
Choose the number of t-shirts you wish to order by clicking on the perk's description. Then you'll be redirected to another page to enter your payment information.
When the campaign is over, you will receive a survey via email from your pledge asking you for the models you wish to receive and your shipping information.
Once your survey is submitted to us, your t-shirts will be shipped to you within one month and a half and two months. 

 

 
We are two guys - Pier-Luc and Simon. We always had a desire to make a positive difference in the world and to do cool, creative things.
 


 
Brass & Metti is born from our relentless desire to find versatile, high quality and good looking t-shirts that promote a positive message. Most empowering tees sold on the market today are cheap and poorly made. Plus, they are designed for gym freaks. We just came up with our own answer - Brass & Metti clothes to empower the soul.
These luxe t-shirts have seen the rise of the sun because we believe that life's too short to be insignificant. We believe in thinking differently. We believe in breaking the status quo. We believe that it is better to be a sheepherder than a sheep. We believe that you are limitless. Thus, we fashioned a t-shirt made from the finest materials that will last for years to come that represents the philosophy we abide to. So, we just happened to create the world's most empowering t-shirts.
 

 
Brass & Metti t-shirts hold a story. It hides in the seams and whispers from the fold. Each t-shirt has been designed with an obsessive attention to details like an alchemist brewing a concoction in his laboratory.
Each premium top is fashioned from sun baking cotton adroitly chosen by a skillful artisan. That fabric provides a magnificent fit that underlines the most beautiful curves of your silhouette as well as providing a velvety-comfy and smooth comfort like a sweet caress from an angel ascended from the sky. The robust seams and pre-shrunk textile promote an abiding durability and appearance for years to come.
You can trust us when we say you’ll get the same quality offered by the most prestigious clothing labels like Dolce & Gabanna, Gucci, Diesel & Ralph Lauren for example.
 

 
Most empowering tees sold on the market today are for a particular clientele - gym freaks. The main goal with Brass & Metti was to create a versatile piece of clothing that you can wear anytime anywhere.
Going to the gym is good for your health and should be part of anyone's routine. What if you could bring those positive or empowering quotes anywhere you go instead - not only in the gym. This is why we chose to focus on very simplistic and modern designs. You can wear your luxe t-shirt to the bar, in a nightclub, on a date, on the beach, at the office, etc.
Show the world what you stand for anytime and anywhere.

</div>
<div>
<p>Like it's founders, CAT – Creative Arts &amp; Technology – is a funky, fresh marriage of tech and fashion. Al, an IT Director at a large Fortune 500 company in Silicon Valley, geeks out making innovative tech projects in their basement, otherwise known as The Lab. And Erin, US head for an open source hardware company, and fervent fashion enthusiast, gets her groove on hanging out in her overflowing closet with her beloved cats and (many, many) purses. Nearly two decades after these two crazy cats said I DO, they have finally merged their individual interests into one cool, light up bag!</p>
<p>Fresh off his successfully funded PIXEL V2: LED Art Kickstarter campaign, Al was looking into new LED formats. “What’s that,” Erin said one night while he was tweaking around with a rectangular LED matrix. “It’s my latest LED format,” Al said. “You know that would look awesome if we converted it into a clutch,” she said. And Boom – the CAT Clutch was born. Erin got to sketching out bags and Al got to streamlining his Pixel Art boards to fit her designs.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong></p>
<p>Your CAT Clutch will go 10-12 hours on continuous use.</p>
<p><strong>How to re-charge the CAT Clutch?</strong></p>
<p>Your CAT Clutch comes included with a charger but you can also use any standard microUSB phone charger too.</p>
<p><strong>Is iOS and Android supported?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we've got apps for both. Feel free to preview our iOS app and our Android app.</p>
<p><strong>What are the dimensions and weight of the CAT Clutch?</strong></p>
<p>The dimensions are 8 inches long x 4 inches tall x 2 inches wide and it weighs 1 pound and 5 ounces.</p>
<p><strong>Can I create and upload my own LED designs?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you'll share your GIF animation or PNG/JPG still image to our CAT Clutch iOS or Android app and then just select from there. Keep in mind the CAT Clutch is a low resolution display at 32x16 = 512 LED pixels so you'll want to scale your artwork accordingly. Googling ""pixel art"" is a great way to find existing art and inspiration. </p>
<p><strong>Is the CAT Clutch wafer proof?</strong></p>
<p>The CAT Clutch is NOT water proof. Treat your CAT Clutch as you would your non water proof phone. </p>
<p><strong>Can the CAT Clutch display scrolling messages?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, just type your message in our app and it will scroll across your bag.</p>
<p><strong>Can the CAT Clutch display text messages?</strong></p>
<p>This is not enabled in the app by default but yes you can turn this on in our app's settings and then any text message received will also scroll across your CAT Clutch.</p>
<p><strong>Are there other styles available than Black Glitter?</strong></p>
<p>When we did our initial crowd funding campaign, the Black Glitter style was hands down the most popular. So to minimize risk as sourcing different resin styles adds complexity, we are only offering the Black Glitter style for this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Will I need to pay customs / duty fees?</strong></p>
<p>For shipments outside of the United States, you will be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by your country which are not included in the price. Sorry, we have no control over these charges and can't predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; so please contact your local customs office for more information.</p>
