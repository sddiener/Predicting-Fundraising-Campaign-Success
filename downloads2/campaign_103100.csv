<p>Reversion is an adventure game at it's classic style (Point &amp; Click game), situated in the city of Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>In the year 2035, the city is completly isolated from the rest of the country because of an event that happend 20 years before. Our character wakes up in that bleak future without memories, and as he keeps in touch with that reality, he starts to realize that he has the key to revert the events.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the game can already be freely downloaded from our web site. (<a href=""http://www.reversion-eljuego.com.ar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Reversion - Official Site"">www.reversion-eljuego.com.ar</a>)</p>
<p>Actually we are developing the second chapter of the game, and it's there where we need your help. We have this ingiegogo campaign for our international fans and another campaign in the site idea.me for our local fans. :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What will be seen in the second chapter?</h2>
<p><img alt=""Reversion - The Meeting"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/270263/pictures/full/20120615173318-Entrada-Ingenieria-02.jpg?1339806819"" src="""" style="""" title=""Reversion - The Meeting""/></p>

<p>The Chapter 2 will be a lot more captivating than the first one.</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of important details of the core argument will be revealed.</li>
<li>There will be more diversity of sceneries, with beautiful exteriors and more recognizable places from the city of Buenos Aires.</li>
<li>It will be considearbly longer than the first chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>What will be done with the amount gathered?</h2>
<p>The focus will be the development of the second chapter. If it greatly exceeds the initial target, that money will be invested in financing the next chapters.</p>
<p>We have enough plot to produce at least 6 chapters, and based on the amount gathered we will develop as many chapters as we can.</p>

</div></div>","What's Reversion and why indiegogo?

Reversion is an adventure game at it's classic style (Point & Click game), situated in the city of Buenos Aires.
In the year 2035, the city is completly isolated from the rest of the country because of an event that happend 20 years before. Our character wakes up in that bleak future without memories, and as he keeps in touch with that reality, he starts to realize that he has the key to revert the events.
The first chapter of the game can already be freely downloaded from our web site. (www.reversion-eljuego.com.ar)
Actually we are developing the second chapter of the game, and it's there where we need your help. We have this ingiegogo campaign for our international fans and another campaign in the site idea.me for our local fans. :)
 
What will be seen in the second chapter?



The Chapter 2 will be a lot more captivating than the first one.

A lot of important details of the core argument will be revealed.
There will be more diversity of sceneries, with beautiful exteriors and more recognizable places from the city of Buenos Aires.
It will be considearbly longer than the first chapter.

 
What will be done with the amount gathered?
The focus will be the development of the second chapter. If it greatly exceeds the initial target, that money will be invested in financing the next chapters.
We have enough plot to produce at least 6 chapters, and based on the amount gathered we will develop as many chapters as we can.

Among the things planned for the future, is the idea of porting the game to different mobile devices, as iOS or Android.
 
Who is developing it?

The game is being developed by 3f Interactivo (http://www.soluciones3f.com.ar), a small Argentinian company that started developing custom software. Reversion is our first production in the world of videogames, and we are very excited with the results obtained up to now.
The team is composed of an ilustrator, an interfaces designer, several programmers and a lot of people that is getting involved in the countless disciplines required to acomplish a good product.
We hope you enjoy it, but we are not satisfied with that, so we have prepared a variety of rewards if you wish to accompany us during this project.

<span class=""notranlsate""><p>Good day and thank you for taking the time out
 of your daily life to find out more about Fortune Finders the game. 
This app will reflect the functionality of a treasure hunt app, in which
 case users are directed to certain locations and instructed to perform 
certain tasks/actions to win random prizes. In this case, the app will 
gauge users by instructing them to find a pre-defined list of items at 
various locations. Each location will have designated product and that 
product’s bar-code would be the key to winning the prize. However, this 
specific bar-code will not be shared with the users. Users will be 
tasked to visit to the location in their vicinity and find the 
designated product (already shown in the app). Once at the location, 
users can check in to verify their arrival at the location, user can 
then start to scan the bar-codes of the designated product to find the 
unique bar-code (which has the prize).
</p>
<p>The database of the app will have a list of unique bar-codes of 
various products. Each unique bar-code will be linked up to a prize. As 
the competition of the day begins, the users of the app will be sent a 
picture of the product as mentioned above as well as the information of 
the nearby location. Once at the location, users will start to scan 
various bar-codes of the item they are looking for. Once the user scans 
the bar-code which is linked up to the database of the app, he/she will 
get a notification that they have won the prize of the day. </p>
<p>The idea just kind of popped up.  I don’t really remember if it has a
 history, if it even has one.  The idea has defiantly evolved and will 
continue to evolve according to the ideas and feedback we get from our 
members.  Everyone has fears about whether things will work out or not, 
no matter what their particular dream is.  After talking to a number of 
people I am very confident in our ability to succeed long term.  And out
 biggest pull is giving back to our members, which is not only important
 for the Fortune Finders community but the me as well.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p></span><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why We Need You:<br/>
</h3>
<span class=""notranlsate""></span><h1><span class=""notranlsate""></span></h1>
<span class=""notranlsate"">What I need is the money to finish the 
creation of the the first Fortune Finders app for android and Mac IOS.  I
 am having a development team take over the design and work out the UI 
but I would also love input from you the Indiegogo supporters on the 
overall game play. I decided to go with a mobile app so that our gamers 
are not limited to a certain location but can play any where their phone
 can go, and by making it on your phone it is not something you don’t 
normally carry with you any way. The money will also handle all 
marketing to spread the word to build a global community of people from 
all walks of life that would really enjoy what Fortune Finders as to 
offer, but like any Indiegogo I am hoping that  most of the marketing 
will hopefully be you the Indiegogo community to spread the word. The 
idea is that the more people we have, the more money/prizes we can give 
away for just playing the game. That is a true goal for me to reach.  
We also need extra cash for licensing agreements and posting on the 
ITunes network, and things like that.<br/><br/><br/></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span><h3>Some of the rewards:</h3>

<p>In a nut shell, Fortune Finders is about creating a fun interactive game that you can put away then pick back up again anytime, anywhere. The community it will build will sustain itself with a small monthly fee for all of it's users. There also will be a free account for those that want to take it for a test drive before buying. The membership to join the Fortune Finders Online community is going to be $5 a month and 3 out of those $5 goes right back into the business for the rewards &amp; prizes given out.  Advertising money and licensing money for marketing projects run through us. We will also be putting most of the money into improving this Fortune Finders Game and future games. All games will have a way to pay the Fortune Finders community back. The rewards will all vary, but with the right number of people we expect to be giving out large gift cards, TVs, entertainment systems, shopping sprees, global trips, and many other large prices that can range from several hundred to several thousand easily.</p>

<h1>Failure is not an option:</h1>
<p>This is not really an option for me.  Personally I have been working so that I can have a better life for my family and change the way games are made and played.  But I always wanted to form a community of like minded gamers that didn’t just pay to play but also the community that could give back. Most games don’t do this and I believe that all the time and money us gamers put into these games it’s about time they started giving back. The whole blueprint of the game was to give back to the Fortune Finders community.  I want this to be a game, but also a fun way for people to spend time together and win great prizes for themselves or even other people. This business is for me, and for you as well. So come and support a game that has you in mind from beginning to end.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Since this whole project is based on a community aspect then that makes the biggest risk, building that community. So unlike other Indiegogo campaigns that just need the money, Fortune Finders is going to have to engage, engage and re-engage our gaming community each and every month. That's also why this is going to be a start of a series of new games and not just one. We are going to give most of the freedom to the paying membership community so that they are playing the games they want and winning the prizes they desire. </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary:
Good day and thank you for taking the time out
 of your daily life to find out more about Fortune Finders the game. 
This app will reflect the functionality of a treasure hunt app, in which
 case users are directed to certain locations and instructed to perform 
certain tasks/actions to win random prizes. In this case, the app will 
gauge users by instructing them to find a pre-defined list of items at 
various locations. Each location will have designated product and that 
product’s bar-code would be the key to winning the prize. However, this 
specific bar-code will not be shared with the users. Users will be 
tasked to visit to the location in their vicinity and find the 
designated product (already shown in the app). Once at the location, 
users can check in to verify their arrival at the location, user can 
then start to scan the bar-codes of the designated product to find the 
unique bar-code (which has the prize).

The database of the app will have a list of unique bar-codes of 
various products. Each unique bar-code will be linked up to a prize. As 
the competition of the day begins, the users of the app will be sent a 
picture of the product as mentioned above as well as the information of 
the nearby location. Once at the location, users will start to scan 
various bar-codes of the item they are looking for. Once the user scans 
the bar-code which is linked up to the database of the app, he/she will 
get a notification that they have won the prize of the day. 
The idea just kind of popped up.  I don’t really remember if it has a
 history, if it even has one.  The idea has defiantly evolved and will 
continue to evolve according to the ideas and feedback we get from our 
members.  Everyone has fears about whether things will work out or not, 
no matter what their particular dream is.  After talking to a number of 
people I am very confident in our ability to succeed long term.  And out
 biggest pull is giving back to our members, which is not only important
 for the Fortune Finders community but the me as well.



Why We Need You:


What I need is the money to finish the 
creation of the the first Fortune Finders app for android and Mac IOS.  I
 am having a development team take over the design and work out the UI 
but I would also love input from you the Indiegogo supporters on the 
overall game play. I decided to go with a mobile app so that our gamers 
are not limited to a certain location but can play any where their phone
 can go, and by making it on your phone it is not something you don’t 
normally carry with you any way. The money will also handle all 
marketing to spread the word to build a global community of people from 
all walks of life that would really enjoy what Fortune Finders as to 
offer, but like any Indiegogo I am hoping that  most of the marketing 
will hopefully be you the Indiegogo community to spread the word. The 
idea is that the more people we have, the more money/prizes we can give 
away for just playing the game. That is a true goal for me to reach.  
We also need extra cash for licensing agreements and posting on the 
ITunes network, and things like that.Some of the rewards:

Our super cool Fortune Finders T-Shirt


Keep the sun out your eyes and look good doing it while wearing your Fortune Finder Hat.


Show your support everywhere you go with our Fortune Finders stickers


Membership and Free Accounts:



In a nut shell, Fortune Finders is about creating a fun interactive game that you can put away then pick back up again anytime, anywhere. The community it will build will sustain itself with a small monthly fee for all of it's users. There also will be a free account for those that want to take it for a test drive before buying. The membership to join the Fortune Finders Online community is going to be $5 a month and 3 out of those $5 goes right back into the business for the rewards & prizes given out.  Advertising money and licensing money for marketing projects run through us. We will also be putting most of the money into improving this Fortune Finders Game and future games. All games will have a way to pay the Fortune Finders community back. The rewards will all vary, but with the right number of people we expect to be giving out large gift cards, TVs, entertainment systems, shopping sprees, global trips, and many other large prices that can range from several hundred to several thousand easily.





This is an example to represent all the different items that get scanned.

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Do you have a fantasy? Then you have half won. You just need to make it real. This can be happened by using 3Dsimo which simply and fast enables you to draw 3D objects. And you don´t even need technical training. 3Dsimo has no limitations only user´s imagination and skillfulness. We have prepared for you set of models from various materials. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/70198/files/20130912113436-koncept-style-3desimo-vizual24.jpg?1379010876"" src="""" style=""width: 536.36px; height: 380px;""/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">3Dsimo as a first on the world provides to user the possibility to choose print options on a digital display. The adjustability of temperature and speed of materials throughput now offer amazing opportunities for your creativity. We can handle various materials as ABS, PLA,PET,HIPS,FLEX black, PVA (water-soluble material), nylon at different temperatures in order to achieve fast <font style=""background-color: rgb(255, 192, 203); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">filling</font> or even print in the air. Other options include backlight, turn on preheating or memory for storing settings. These parameters are used to determine the appropriate method of drawing.</span></p>

<p></p></span><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Do not be limited by the choice of materials, for example choose between golden, silver, wooden or flexible PLA. Over time, new materials will be increasing due to the growing trend of 3D printing. Our 3Dsimo is fully prepared for this due to configurability of all parameters and thermal feedback for determining the exact temperature.</span></p>

<h3>How it works?</h3>
<p>3Dsimo is so simple to use as a pencil. Everyone who have ever draw with pencil will not have a problem to use 3Dsimo. After plugging it in you set the desired speed and temperature according to the material (these data will be appended together with 3Dsimo and new materials will be updated). 3Dsimo is based on the principle of FDM technology thus extruding plastic material through the hot end. If you want to print into the air or create infill of any object you can do it easily and quickly. There is no problem just make your choice. After a while of use you will find that with 3Dsimo you can create fantastic objects.</p>
<p>3Dsimo has many utilization:</p>

<br/><h3>What we can create?</h3>
<p>When drawing with normal pencil one is still improving and invents a new variations of drawings, then the same applies for our 3Dsimo. With 3Dsimo you may always think up new forms of creating 3D objects. Printing can be done on almost every solid material but for PLA it is recommended glass surface and paper for ABS.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/70404/files/20130912130012-koncept-style-3desimo-vizual23.jpg?1379016012"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>Components and Equipment:</h3>
<p>The whole 3Dsimo weights 180gr and its length is 170 mm. A part of equipment is a holder in which can be 3Dsimo simply and safely store and powered. For each 3Dsimo you also get a starting package of materials for experimentation. The package contains 3 ABS strings in different colors and 3 PLA 3 strings. Each string has a length of five meters so you have for testing an incredible 30 meters. We are progressively inventing and generating extenders pro drawing geometrical figures and to elevate the whole product on higher level. 3Dsimo has functional design for adding extenders and elimination of accidental burn when touch its jet.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/70406/files/20130912130104-koncept-style-3desimo-vizual25.jpg?1379016064"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>As printing material can be used all the plastic material for the 3D printer such as ABS, PLA, nylon, PVA. 3Dsimo uses a string with a width of 1.75 mm, the width of the strings was chosen as the most common for today´s printers. It is then easily available.<br/></p>

<p>If we reach at least 150 sold pieces the collected amount will be used to create injection molding form from nobel metal that cost $ 3500. If we will not reach as many sold pieces as required the project will be still realized with silicone forms and master model and their following casting. Silicone forms have been made yet and the next week the results are going to be published. Also the collected amount will be used for CE certificate that needs to have every product going to market. And of course for entire realization of project and making final product for you! I want to aware you on indiegogo is price of 3Dsimo lowest you can ever get.</p>

Frequently asked questions:

</h3>
<p><strong>1. What materiel it used to craft?
 </strong></p>
<p>1.Only with 3Dsimo you can use different types of material as ABS (known as a material for LEGO bricks), PLA nature friendly material on the basis of starch, PVA which is soluble in water and last but not the least nylon. Material used is a 1.75mm this fiber.You can choose proper temperature and material speed, so you have more options what kind of material to use.</p>
<p><strong>2. What comes in Full Commercial Package?</strong></p>
<p>2. 3Dsimo full set includes 3Dsimo amazing pen, docking station, 30 meters of a printing material ABS also as PLA and a power supply unit. We are finalizing few more amazing extensions now. First two of them you will see in one week time!

</p>
<p><strong>3.Where do we get that material once we ran out.</strong>
</p>
<p>3.We are going to offer you all mentioned types of material in all color options 20m each. If you have another needs, just let us know.

</p>
<p><strong>4.Is it toxic, safe for kids to craft? I mean will it be hot while using or washable when used on skin,cloths?</strong>
</p>
<p>4.Materials as ABS,PLA,PVA or Nylon are not dangerous and toxic. You can find these materials in LEGO, foodstuffs or textile. The material is hot for a very limited time, we cannot recommend you to apply it on your body, but for example application on textile, glass or even paper is fine.

</p>
<p><strong>5. Battery life of this device, can we have more information about it how it works actually?</strong>
</p>
<p>5.Our device doesn't have a battery as of now, we use a power supply unit. In the gallerz you can find a video previewing all the parametrs you can setup. 3Dsimo is based on the principle of FDM technology thus extruding plastic string through the hot end. You can choose a temperature which differs at each kind. It is only up to you how thick layer of the material you will decide to use, look at the LEGO brick from ABS. Once again thank you for your questions. Hope you to support our project.</p>

And you don´t even need technical training. 3Dsimo has no limitations only user´s imagination and skillfulness. We have prepared for you set of models from various materials. 

3Dsimo as a first on the world provides to user the possibility to choose print options on a digital display. The adjustability of temperature and speed of materials throughput now offer amazing opportunities for your creativity. We can handle various materials as ABS, PLA,PET,HIPS,FLEX black, PVA (water-soluble material), nylon at different temperatures in order to achieve fast filling or even print in the air. Other options include backlight, turn on preheating or memory for storing settings. These parameters are used to determine the appropriate method of drawing.


Do not be limited by the choice of materials, for example choose between golden, silver, wooden or flexible PLA. Over time, new materials will be increasing due to the growing trend of 3D printing. Our 3Dsimo is fully prepared for this due to configurability of all parameters and thermal feedback for determining the exact temperature.

How it works?
3Dsimo is so simple to use as a pencil. Everyone who have ever draw with pencil will not have a problem to use 3Dsimo. After plugging it in you set the desired speed and temperature according to the material (these data will be appended together with 3Dsimo and new materials will be updated). 3Dsimo is based on the principle of FDM technology thus extruding plastic material through the hot end. If you want to print into the air or create infill of any object you can do it easily and quickly. There is no problem just make your choice. After a while of use you will find that with 3Dsimo you can create fantastic objects.
3Dsimo has many utilization:


Repairing of plastic devices


Bonding and assembling models of 3D printers


Repair abortive print (due to repair you don’t need to enter new several hours lasting print)


Creating jewelry


To implement your ideas


Simply for the joy of modeling



What we can create?
When drawing with normal pencil one is still improving and invents a new variations of drawings, then the same applies for our 3Dsimo. With 3Dsimo you may always think up new forms of creating 3D objects. Printing can be done on almost every solid material but for PLA it is recommended glass surface and paper for ABS.

Components and Equipment:
The whole 3Dsimo weights 180gr and its length is 170 mm. A part of equipment is a holder in which can be 3Dsimo simply and safely store and powered. For each 3Dsimo you also get a starting package of materials for experimentation. The package contains 3 ABS strings in different colors and 3 PLA 3 strings. Each string has a length of five meters so you have for testing an incredible 30 meters. We are progressively inventing and generating extenders pro drawing geometrical figures and to elevate the whole product on higher level. 3Dsimo has functional design for adding extenders and elimination of accidental burn when touch its jet.

As printing material can be used all the plastic material for the 3D printer such as ABS, PLA, nylon, PVA. 3Dsimo uses a string with a width of 1.75 mm, the width of the strings was chosen as the most common for today´s printers. It is then easily available.
What are we going to do with collected sum of money?
If we reach at least 150 sold pieces the collected amount will be used to create injection molding form from nobel metal that cost $ 3500. If we will not reach as many sold pieces as required the project will be still realized with silicone forms and master model and their following casting. Silicone forms have been made yet and the next week the results are going to be published. Also the collected amount will be used for CE certificate that needs to have every product going to market. And of course for entire realization of project and making final product for you! I want to aware you on indiegogo is price of 3Dsimo lowest you can ever get.


Frequently asked questions:


1. What materiel it used to craft?
 
1.Only with 3Dsimo you can use different types of material as ABS (known as a material for LEGO bricks), PLA nature friendly material on the basis of starch, PVA which is soluble in water and last but not the least nylon. Material used is a 1.75mm this fiber.You can choose proper temperature and material speed, so you have more options what kind of material to use.
2. What comes in Full Commercial Package?
2. 3Dsimo full set includes 3Dsimo amazing pen, docking station, 30 meters of a printing material ABS also as PLA and a power supply unit. We are finalizing few more amazing extensions now. First two of them you will see in one week time!


3.Where do we get that material once we ran out.

3.We are going to offer you all mentioned types of material in all color options 20m each. If you have another needs, just let us know.


4.Is it toxic, safe for kids to craft? I mean will it be hot while using or washable when used on skin,cloths?

4.Materials as ABS,PLA,PVA or Nylon are not dangerous and toxic. You can find these materials in LEGO, foodstuffs or textile. The material is hot for a very limited time, we cannot recommend you to apply it on your body, but for example application on textile, glass or even paper is fine.


5. Battery life of this device, can we have more information about it how it works actually?

5.Our device doesn't have a battery as of now, we use a power supply unit. In the gallerz you can find a video previewing all the parametrs you can setup. 3Dsimo is based on the principle of FDM technology thus extruding plastic string through the hot end. You can choose a temperature which differs at each kind. It is only up to you how thick layer of the material you will decide to use, look at the LEGO brick from ABS. Once again thank you for your questions. Hope you to support our project.",14.0,1,"3 Campaigns

<p> </p></div>","Hox is funded !
Thank you for you support!
 
First HD version Screenshot :

 
 
News :  Hox is now scheduled on PC with the Hd version!
All Hd gamer backer will have access to this version when the game will be ready.
You can support Hox on Greenlight too right now !  
 

 
The Game :Hox is a narrative runner game. It is a dexterity game, where the player must dodge and fight everything that stands in his way, but also a game in which the player explores the story and must choose his path and discover the truth about what led the world to his loss.
 

 
 
The Game is divided in Two modes :
Story Mode:
You start the story mode on a map, and you will have to choose your road to reach the last ship. There will be 25 to 30 levels organised around 5 themes. During his trip, Hox will meet survivors who will teach him a lot about the world through interactive dialogues. They will also be able to give him advice about which route to take or jeopardize his quest. The scenario is an important part of the game and reveals a lot of twists and turns. player’actions within levels will be taken into account and have their importance in certain story endings, because the game has several endings. 
 

 
Arcade Mode:
There will be several levels and mode in endless gameplay, unlockable in story mode. Your objective is to survive as long as possible to appear in the online rankings, but also in the great ranking that combines all your best scores for each level.
 

 
The story :
The air on the earth has become unbreathable, plants and animals has mutated and human beings will not be able to survive any longer. Some privileged have already left the Earth, there is still one last ship preparing to join the fleet of colonizers. Hox hides a dark secret preventing him from leaving the planet. You will also discover how the Earth and nature have reached this critical state and you can know the truth only by exploring the story mode many times. The game has multiple endings, which depend on the knowledge of the world that you have acquired during your trip. There will be no good or bad end, only different possibilities.
 
 
Gamedesign and gameplay :
 The game is inspired by Canabalt and Forerunner, and the narrative part by Fallout and Arcanum. with Hox, my goal is to achieve the most dynamic runner game possible, while offering a balance challenge with good speed sensations. The game is controlled with two buttons on smarthphones, the HD version will has some gameplay additions related to speed control via more varied commands.Hox may also encounter mutated animals. Every monster has its own rules of combat, such as the defensive rhino who requires several attacks depending on your speed to be defeated, or the rat, who throws a projectile, but will be much  weaker once in melee.Credibility is very important in my approach to the gameplay and design that is why Hox does not double jump in the void but with a jet pack or by absence of floating bonus, of course; situations are surreal, but I like the fact to justify everything and leave nothing to chance .

 
beta:
Hox wil offer closed beta with the unity  WebPlayer,, it’s an important step because the objective is to balance the difficulty of the game.it will be in  arcade mode, with a scoring system and a comments system to know your detailed opinions.
 

 
sale and target support:
The game is scheduled on PC,  smarthphone, tablet and future Android console. It is also compatible with pc and mac, but I would like your opinion about the value of a runner game on this type of support. the support Iphone is commercially more interesting so if my funding reached the milestone of 10,000 euros or if the sales of its Android are sufficient, I will publish it on iphone.
 

 

Budget and Objective:6500 euros  Hox the Last ship :      

  - 50%  unity 4 pro license and Android unity pro license   - 50% development time
8000 euros More time to develop :  - one screen 2 player versus mode for Hd version   - 2 additional themes , longer story mode with more purpose. 
                          
10 000 euros  Iphone/ipad version :   - iphone unity pro license + apple hardware to test and develop.
 
 
Version FR
 
Le Jeu :Hox est un runner game narratif dédié à Android pour le moment. C’est un jeu d’adresse où le joueur doit esquiver et combattre tout ce qui lui barre la route, mais également un jeu d’exploration scénaristique où le joueur doit choisir sa route et découvrir la vérité sur ce qui a conduit le monde à sa perte.
 

 
Le jeu est divisé en deux modes :
Mode histoire :Vous démarrez le mode histoire sur une carte, et vous devez choisir votre route pour atteindre le dernier vaisseau. Il y aura 25 à 30 maps, réparties sur 5 thèmes. Au cours de son voyage, Hox rencontrera des survivants qui lui en apprendront plus sur le monde via des dialogues interactifs. Ceux-ci pourront aussi le conseiller sur la route à prendre ou compromettre sa quête. Le scénario est une part importante du jeu et possède son lot de surprises et de rebondissements. Les actes du joueur au sein des niveaux seront pris en compte et auront leurs importances lors de certains dénouements, car le jeu possède plusieurs fins.
 
 

 
Mode arcade :Il y aura plusieurs niveaux et modes de jeu infinis, déblocables au sein du mode histoire, et votre objectif sera de survivre le plus longtemps possible afin d'apparaître dans les classements en ligne, mais aussi dans le super classement qui combinera tout vos meilleurs scores pour chaque niveau.
 

 
L’histoire :La terre est devenue irrespirable, les plantes et les animaux ont muté et l'humanité ne pourra y survivre longtemps. Certains privilégiés ont déjà quitté la Terre, il reste encore un dernier vaisseau qui se prépare à rejoindre la flotte des colonisateurs. Hox cache un lourd secret l'empêchant de quitter la planète. Vous découvrirez également comment la Terre et la nature ont atteint cette état critique et vous  ne pourrez connaître la vérité qu’en explorant plusieurs fois le mode histoire. Le jeu aura plusieurs fins qui dépendront des connaissances sur le monde que vous aurez acquises lors de votre voyage. Il n’y aura pas de bonne ou mauvaise fin, juste des possibilités.
 

 
Gamedesign et gameplay :Le jeu est inspiré par Canabalt et Forerunner, et la partie narration par  Fallout et Arcanum. Mon but avec Hox est de réaliser le runner game le plus dynamique possible, tout en proposant un défi équilibré avec de bonnes sensations de vitesse. Le jeu se contrôle avec 2 boutons sur smartphone, la version HD aura certains ajouts de gameplay liés au contrôle de la vitesse via des commandes plus variées.Hox pourra aussi rencontrer des animaux mutants, chaque monstre a ses propres règles de combat, par exemple le rhinocéros se protège et nécessite plusieurs attaques selon votre vitesse pour être vaincu, ou le Rat lui, vous lancera un projectile, mais sera beaucoup plus fragile une fois au corps à corps.La crédibilité est très  importante dans mon approche du gameplay et du design, c’est la raison pour laquelle Hox ne fait pas de double saut dans le vide, mais avec un jet pack ou via l’absence de bonus flottant, évidement les situations sont surréalistes mais j’aime le fait de tout justifier et ne rien laisser au hasard.
 
 

La beta :Hox proposera une beta fermée via le webplayer unity, c’est une étape importante car l’objectif sera d'équilibrer la difficulté du jeu. Elle  présentera le mode arcade, avec un système de scoring et de commentaires pour connaître vos avis détaillés.
 

 
 
Support et vente :Le jeu est prévu sur PC, smartphone, tablette et future console Android.
 Je sais que le support Iphone est commercialement plus intéressant et si mon financement atteint le cap des 10 000 euros ou si les ventes sur Android son suffisantes, je le proposerais sur Iphone.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>July 11th Update:</strong></h3>
<p>We have been listening to the feedback from our development videos. Peple thought Ashley's standard run animation wasn't quite right - that she was leaning over too much. Check the updates page to see a video showing Ashey's adjusted run cycle. Enjoy!</p>
<h3><strong>Ashley Ao Overview</strong></h3>
</div>
<p>Ashley Ao is an awesome action/adventure game for iOS, Android and Mac. With an original sci-fi setting Ashley Ao takes influence from classic arcade games and anime.</p>
<p>Beautiful visuals, crunching sound effects and rousing music. An engaging and intriguing main character. Exciting power ups and abilities. A great gaming experience. This is what Ashley Ao is all about.</p>
<p>We started development in September 2011. With your help we hope to be able to release it to the public in Autumn (Fall) 2012.</p>
<p><img alt=""Ashley Ao"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://honeytribestudios.com/pitch/ashLookUp.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ashley Ao""/></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Story</strong></span> </p>
<p>Ashley has been hired by the dominant species in the universe. A cartel that is technologically and financially superior to anyone else. They profit from terraforming lifeless planets and selling them on to other wealthy species for colonisation. In return for this they trade technology, resources and long term mining agreements.</p>
<p>The buyers are indebted to the cartel for centuries and this is how the cartel have maintained their position of wealth. Buyers who try to renege on a contract are swiftly and severely punished. </p>
<p>In this game Ashley arrives on a newly terraformed planet to find that not everything has been going as planned for the colonisers. As the game progresses she uncovers the history of the planet and she must decide what action to take.</p>
<p>Ashley's motives are not clear from the start. Is she a simply a cold and ruthless mercenary or does she have another agenda?</p>
<p><img alt=""Ashley Ao - Boom!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.honeytribestudios.com/pitch/punch.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ashley Ao - Boom!""/></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Gameplay</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Runner Levels</strong></p>
<p>We want the player to enjoy the feeling of running through beautiful, scrolling, anime-style environments. You must react to the creatures and obstacles in time and collect the resources which will make Ashley more powerful. In these sections Ashley is auto-running. You control her with swipes to change lanes and two onscreen buttons to attack and jump.</p>
<p>Strange creatures are all running to the same destination and Ashley must overtake or neutralise them before they get there. As the game progresses and the story unfolds you will find out what these creatures are, where they came from and what they are running to. Why do they all carry those ancient looking stones?</p>
<p>Jumps and attacks are executed by single, double and triple taps. The controls are designed to be easy to pick up for beginners. Players who can master the timings will be rewarded with a points system of chain-combos.</p>
<p>As the game progresses Ashley will unlock special abilities which are also tied to the story. This is where things get interesting! Hyper-boosting through a wave of creatures and seeing them explode into particles is one of the ways you'll feel like an anime hero on a perilous mission.</p>
<p><img alt=""AshleyAo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.honeytribestudios.com/pitch/bossDanger.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Boss Battle""/></p>
<p><strong>Boss Levels</strong></p>
<p>In these sections platforming is added to the mix and you can freely move left and right. Now it's really time to see Ashley in action! With the responsive controls you'll be able to navigate around the battle arenas with speed and agility. You'll feel like a martial arts super star as you pull out attack combos and fend off creatures from all directions.</p>
<p>You'll be confronted by epic bosses who will send waves of smaller creatures to attack you before moving in for the kill. However not all is as it seems. The bosses are not typical aggressors. They are not attacking you just because they are 'bad guys'. But we don't want to give away everything about the story just yet...!</p>
<p><img alt=""Ashley Ao"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.honeytribestudios.com/pitch/concepts1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Concept Images""/></p>
<p><strong>Epic</strong></p>
<p>We're still influenced by action/adventure games like Flashback (Amiga) and Super Metroid (SNES). How they blend action, story and great atmosphere is something that has been remembered years later. If we are able to exceed our funding goal we'd <em>love</em> to use the extra resources to bring additional developers on board and sculpt Ao into a truly epic game - something that is rarely seen in the world of mobile games.</p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>About Us</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Ryan: </strong>I love art and music. That's all I've ever wanted to do. I graduated art school. And I've been lucky enough to record albums and tour the all over the U.S, Canada and Japan with my band <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/endlesshallway"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Endless Hallway"">Endless Hallway</a>. Making this video game brings together some ideas about aesthetics I've had for a while. I'm a big fan of everything by Studio Ghibli and bringing imaginary worlds to life is something I like to explore with both music and art - and now with Ashley Ao!</p>
<p>It's so satisfying to see what I draw come to life. Animating all of Ashley's movements is a lot of work but when I see it all coming together I get real excited. And then when I see other people playing the test versions of the game and getting a buzz out of it... I can't wait for Ao to be released!</p>
<p><strong>Hi, I'm Shaz</strong>, the game designer for Ashley Ao. I have a creative background with a degree in Commercial Music and have made music which has appeared on several TV shows, games and movies.</p>
<p>Having grown up with games, music and anime - video games are the perfect medium to fuse everything I love about escapist entertainment. As an art form and creative outlet games are pretty new to all of us. Much remains unexplored and it's a creatively exciting space to be in. </p>
<p>As well as making games for other people I've released <a href=""http://www.honeytribestudios.com/games/honey-tribe-colony-collapse"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Honey Tribe: Colony Collapse"">Honey Tribe: Colony Collapse</a> on iOS under my studio name of Honey Tribe Studios. This is a casual game that fuses fact and fiction and features hand drawn art and a dynamic soundtrack. So far over 50,000 people have downloaded it and I'd hope that Ashley Ao can far exceed that!</p>
<p>In early 2012 I decided to jump in the deep end and work full time on my creative efforts - games and game music. Ashley Ao is definitely the most ambitious project I'm involved in. Our goal is that Ao will look, sound and play as good as something made by a larger studio and stand out on mobile devices as a memorable gaming experience.</p>

<p>If you feel that Ashley Ao is an exciting project to be part of we hope you can support development and make a pledge for any of the amounts listed over there on the right.</p>
<p>If you pledge $5 or more you'll receive access to a <strong>digital copy of the finished game</strong>. You can choose the platform - iPhone, iPad, Android or Mac and will have access to all 3 if you go for the <strong>deluxe gamer</strong> package.</p>
<p>On Android we'll either release a version of the game which unlocks the bulk of the content with passwords or just offer you a direct download link. These passwords will only be for backers so we'll try and include some extra surprises for you in the content as a way of saying thanks for helping us to bring Ashley Ao to the world.</p>
<p>For Mac we'll offer a direct DRM free download. </p>
<p>For iOS we'll gift you the app using Apple's system on the day of release. </p>
<p>If you really love what Ao is all about then we welcome you to become a <strong>junior or senior collaborator</strong>. You'll take an active part in shaping how the game is developed. We'd really like to get some people on board who love games and would be enthusiastic about throwing their opinions into the mix and then seeing them influence the game during development.</p>
<p>We'll set up a private forum so ideas and constructive criticism can be discussed freely. </p>
<p><strong>The wall of thanks</strong> will be a dedicated page inside the game where your icon will be placed. It will click through to your site or blog and be the standard size for iOS app icons. Photos with double thumbs up and comedy moustaches are welcome! All images and outbound links will need to comply with Apple's general guidlines.</p>
<p><strong>Senior collaborators</strong> will get involved in very specific aspects of the game - Ashley's special abilities, boss design and level design. If you are artistically minded and want to sketch some things for Ryan to take a look at - great! And if not that's fine too. You can talk to us on skype and reference examples from movies, anime, images and games to help describe what you are thinking of. (As a non-artist that's what Shaz does too!). Then Ryan will make new animations which bring your ideas to life and fit the story and game world of Ashley Ao.</p>

<p><strong>Wow! Someone else cares!</strong> So we sit at our respective desks day in, day out, slowly but surely building up the game. Of course we're excited about Ao and think it's great. But does anyone else really care? It would be great motivation to think that people are waiting for us to finish Ao so they can play it. </p>
<p><strong>Help with the programming. </strong>At the moment, among other things, Shaz is doing it all. Having an extra person to help out would greatly speed up the process.</p>
<p><strong>Having a marketing budget. </strong>At the moment we don't have one. With all the time and effort we have already put into this game it would be pretty depressing if not many people knew about it after releasing! Even a modest marketing budget will help to make mobile gamers aware that Ashley Ao exists. We're pretty sure that Ao is something that mobile gamers want – but we need to make sure they know about in the first place! </p>
<p><strong>Help with the animation.</strong> Right now Ryan is doing it all by himself. As we wanted to go for a hand drawn style with an anime look that means a lot of animations and images! If we can exceed our funding goal we can think about getting some help with art and speeding up the project. </p>
<p><strong>Help with the audio.</strong> Hiring a voice actress to make some custom attack cries for Ashley would be perfect. It would also be really cool to include some tracks by up and coming bands and artists in both the game and the soundtrack. So we have to show them that, not only does Ao look like a really exciting game, but there are people out there who are actively waiting for us to finish it so they can play it.</p>

<p><img alt=""Ashley Ao - injured"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.honeytribestudios.com/pitch/AshlelyAo_Dog.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ashley Ao - injured""/></p></div>","July 11th Update:
We have been listening to the feedback from our development videos. Peple thought Ashley's standard run animation wasn't quite right - that she was leaning over too much. Check the updates page to see a video showing Ashey's adjusted run cycle. Enjoy!
Ashley Ao Overview

Ashley Ao is an awesome action/adventure game for iOS, Android and Mac. With an original sci-fi setting Ashley Ao takes influence from classic arcade games and anime.
Beautiful visuals, crunching sound effects and rousing music. An engaging and intriguing main character. Exciting power ups and abilities. A great gaming experience. This is what Ashley Ao is all about.
We started development in September 2011. With your help we hope to be able to release it to the public in Autumn (Fall) 2012.

The Story 
Ashley has been hired by the dominant species in the universe. A cartel that is technologically and financially superior to anyone else. They profit from terraforming lifeless planets and selling them on to other wealthy species for colonisation. In return for this they trade technology, resources and long term mining agreements.
The buyers are indebted to the cartel for centuries and this is how the cartel have maintained their position of wealth. Buyers who try to renege on a contract are swiftly and severely punished. 
In this game Ashley arrives on a newly terraformed planet to find that not everything has been going as planned for the colonisers. As the game progresses she uncovers the history of the planet and she must decide what action to take.
Ashley's motives are not clear from the start. Is she a simply a cold and ruthless mercenary or does she have another agenda?

The Gameplay
Runner Levels
We want the player to enjoy the feeling of running through beautiful, scrolling, anime-style environments. You must react to the creatures and obstacles in time and collect the resources which will make Ashley more powerful. In these sections Ashley is auto-running. You control her with swipes to change lanes and two onscreen buttons to attack and jump.
Strange creatures are all running to the same destination and Ashley must overtake or neutralise them before they get there. As the game progresses and the story unfolds you will find out what these creatures are, where they came from and what they are running to. Why do they all carry those ancient looking stones?
Jumps and attacks are executed by single, double and triple taps. The controls are designed to be easy to pick up for beginners. Players who can master the timings will be rewarded with a points system of chain-combos.
As the game progresses Ashley will unlock special abilities which are also tied to the story. This is where things get interesting! Hyper-boosting through a wave of creatures and seeing them explode into particles is one of the ways you'll feel like an anime hero on a perilous mission.

Boss Levels
In these sections platforming is added to the mix and you can freely move left and right. Now it's really time to see Ashley in action! With the responsive controls you'll be able to navigate around the battle arenas with speed and agility. You'll feel like a martial arts super star as you pull out attack combos and fend off creatures from all directions.
You'll be confronted by epic bosses who will send waves of smaller creatures to attack you before moving in for the kill. However not all is as it seems. The bosses are not typical aggressors. They are not attacking you just because they are 'bad guys'. But we don't want to give away everything about the story just yet...!

Epic
We're still influenced by action/adventure games like Flashback (Amiga) and Super Metroid (SNES). How they blend action, story and great atmosphere is something that has been remembered years later. If we are able to exceed our funding goal we'd love to use the extra resources to bring additional developers on board and sculpt Ao into a truly epic game - something that is rarely seen in the world of mobile games.

About Us
Ryan: I love art and music. That's all I've ever wanted to do. I graduated art school. And I've been lucky enough to record albums and tour the all over the U.S, Canada and Japan with my band Endless Hallway. Making this video game brings together some ideas about aesthetics I've had for a while. I'm a big fan of everything by Studio Ghibli and bringing imaginary worlds to life is something I like to explore with both music and art - and now with Ashley Ao!
It's so satisfying to see what I draw come to life. Animating all of Ashley's movements is a lot of work but when I see it all coming together I get real excited. And then when I see other people playing the test versions of the game and getting a buzz out of it... I can't wait for Ao to be released!
Hi, I'm Shaz, the game designer for Ashley Ao. I have a creative background with a degree in Commercial Music and have made music which has appeared on several TV shows, games and movies.
Having grown up with games, music and anime - video games are the perfect medium to fuse everything I love about escapist entertainment. As an art form and creative outlet games are pretty new to all of us. Much remains unexplored and it's a creatively exciting space to be in. 
As well as making games for other people I've released Honey Tribe: Colony Collapse on iOS under my studio name of Honey Tribe Studios. This is a casual game that fuses fact and fiction and features hand drawn art and a dynamic soundtrack. So far over 50,000 people have downloaded it and I'd hope that Ashley Ao can far exceed that!
In early 2012 I decided to jump in the deep end and work full time on my creative efforts - games and game music. Ashley Ao is definitely the most ambitious project I'm involved in. Our goal is that Ao will look, sound and play as good as something made by a larger studio and stand out on mobile devices as a memorable gaming experience.

The Rewards
If you feel that Ashley Ao is an exciting project to be part of we hope you can support development and make a pledge for any of the amounts listed over there on the right.
If you pledge $5 or more you'll receive access to a digital copy of the finished game. You can choose the platform - iPhone, iPad, Android or Mac and will have access to all 3 if you go for the deluxe gamer package.
On Android we'll either release a version of the game which unlocks the bulk of the content with passwords or just offer you a direct download link. These passwords will only be for backers so we'll try and include some extra surprises for you in the content as a way of saying thanks for helping us to bring Ashley Ao to the world.
For Mac we'll offer a direct DRM free download. 
For iOS we'll gift you the app using Apple's system on the day of release. 
If you really love what Ao is all about then we welcome you to become a junior or senior collaborator. You'll take an active part in shaping how the game is developed. We'd really like to get some people on board who love games and would be enthusiastic about throwing their opinions into the mix and then seeing them influence the game during development.
We'll set up a private forum so ideas and constructive criticism can be discussed freely. 
The wall of thanks will be a dedicated page inside the game where your icon will be placed. It will click through to your site or blog and be the standard size for iOS app icons. Photos with double thumbs up and comedy moustaches are welcome! All images and outbound links will need to comply with Apple's general guidlines.
Senior collaborators will get involved in very specific aspects of the game - Ashley's special abilities, boss design and level design. If you are artistically minded and want to sketch some things for Ryan to take a look at - great! And if not that's fine too. You can talk to us on skype and reference examples from movies, anime, images and games to help describe what you are thinking of. (As a non-artist that's what Shaz does too!). Then Ryan will make new animations which bring your ideas to life and fit the story and game world of Ashley Ao.

Every bit counts towards making this dream a reality.  Anyone donating $5 or more will get a ""Thank You"" email as well as work in progress pictures of the projects you are helping fund, giving you an inside look at what Tabletop is cooking up next.
 
$25- Supporter Level
In addition to your ""Thank You"" email we will create a unique goodie bag just for you.  With all the projects we have going on at any time, we end up with spare bits, miniatures, dice and more.  We will package up several items and send them to you. We may even throw in a painted model if we have any spares at the time.  We hope you can put these items to use on your own gaming table or conversion work.

 
$50- Donor Level
At this level you are getting the ""Thank You"" email and goodie bag. You are also going to get a hand painted miniature that will be painted by our staff to match one of the Tabletop studio armies.  This is a unique chance to own a little piece of Tabletop.  Display it to remind yourself of your contribution, or play it in games of your own. 
 
$100- Member
Does Tabletop sound like the kind of place you want to play? Heres a chance to become a member! In addition to the ""Thank You"" note, goodie bag, and Tabletop studio model, you are going to get a gift certificate good for a 3 month membership.  That means no entry fees, the ability to reserve tables, entry into give aways and more!  This is a great option for those donors close enough to come into the store and play once we open the doors.

 
$125- Sponsor
Got a D&D character you need a model for? Maybe a hero character for your favorite army?  This is your chance to get one painted up for you by the Tabletop staff.  Choose a model worth $25 or less (provide us with a link to the model so we know exactly what you want) and we will order it, build it, paint it and ship it to you along with your ""Thank You"" note, goodie bag, and studio model!

 
$150- Table Sponsor
At this level, you are getting the ""Thank You"" note, goodie bag, and Tabletop studio model and... wait for it... you get to immortialze yourself and name the table you are giving us the money to build!  Name it after yourself, a friend, a loved one, a gaming group or your favorite My Little Pony (we arent here to judge).  We reserve the right to veto any vulgar/offensive names. Just imagine your grandmother is going to play at this table.

 
$250- The Big One
This is it, the best we have to offer. The same as Table Sponsor but you get to give us a concept for what the terrain should be.  Be creative and have fun with it.  What have you always wanted to play on.  Maybe its a zombie apocalypes city or a castle siege?  Just please be realistic about it.  I dont want to get... ""It's just like earth except everything is lime green"".  But if you give us a rough idea, we will come up with a great board you will be proud to have contributed too.  Along with this you get all the perks from the Donor level as well.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate, but you feel that our vision is worthwhile, please help us out by spreading the word.  Post a link on Facebook or tell your friends about this page.  Even telling one person is a big help to us.
 
No matter what your contribution, we here at Tabletop Gaming Center want to thank you for your interest and support in our goal to put gaming back in the hands of the gamers.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

So, I decided, what the hey, let's build a combat robot. Enter CIAR, the Combat integrated Airsoft Robot.<br/><br/>I got my first inspiration for CIAR while watching FutureWeapons. There's an episode with a robot called the Foster-Miller TALON-SWORDS, a remotely controlled platform mounting an M249 machine gun. It seemed like a simple enough platform to replicate, and I set about designing my own take on the tracked combat robot concept. <br/><br/>This has been an extremely ambitious project for me. The design has gone through dozens of iterations, from a fully welded aluminum body, to steel-framed polycarbonate, from high-end embedded control systems to powerful Arduino microcontrollers. I've worked out all the kinks, I've done all the math, and now I just need a bit of help.<br/><br/>CIAR will be fully-remote controlled, at ranges of up to a mile, with live-feed cameras and a turret, most likely utilizing a heavily modified P90 platform, in my opinion a great gearbox for durability, reliability, compactness and performance. <br/><br/>Primarily, CIAR will be an observation platform, with secondary roles of point defense and supression. It's small profile(3'x2'x1' dimensions) will give it great concealment, especially with the addition of something as simple as camouflage netting. <br/><br/>Some may raise the issue of hit-calling, but I've already thought this out, too. Any sort of ordnance weapon, such as a 40mm shower launcher or a Thunder-B, will be considered a ""kill"" on the robot. In addition, if a player is able to physically touch this robot, it counts as a kill, simulating the planting of a demolition charge or another sort of explosive. hit-calling will be honor system, dependant on the operator of the robot to call the CIAR out, the same as a hit on any player. <br/><h3><br/></h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>The breakdown:</p><ul>
<li>My current estimates for this project are putting the price at around $1,500, but I'm setting my online fundraising goal at just $500. I know if I can get your support, I can make this happen, and make this uniquely awesome. $300 goes towards the Ardupilot brain of the robot, another $130 goes into the high-power motor controller, and almost $900 goes into the frame and body of the robot, as well as drivetrain components.</li>
<li>As a thank-you for contributing, I'm setting up three perks:<br/>-$15 will get you a paper target with your name shot into it by CIAR.<br/>-$25 will get you the above, as well as full designs for CIAR, so you can make your own if so inclined.<br/>-$50 will get you the above, as well as a 3D-printed model of CIAR. </li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal, my funds get sent back to you, no-risk.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>So, Why Contribute?</h3><p>CIAR has the potential to revolutionize the world of Airsoft. Our modern military makes use of thousands of drones and robots, and thus far all attempts at bringing that technology into Airsoft have been a disaster(See Airsoft GI's Parrot AR drone fail). CIAR is ready to bring a completely new dimension to the game we all love, adding in potential for innovative scenarios, such as IED disposal simulations.</p><ul>
<li>As this is my Senior project, completing CIAR is very important to me. This project is graded for me. </li>
<li>I've been a part of my school's Robotics Club for a couple years, now, and have automated R/C cars. I've built a deadmau5 mask with functional sound and lights, as well. This will be my first robotics project of this scale.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Hep</h3><p>Contributing is the best way to help out, but if you're unable to and still want to make a difference, s<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hare this campaign on facebook, twitter, google+, Tumblr, MySpace, etc. etc. etc. The more people who see this, the more funds come in.

If I don't reach my goal, my funds get sent back to you, no-risk.
So, Why Contribute?CIAR has the potential to revolutionize the world of Airsoft. Our modern military makes use of thousands of drones and robots, and thus far all attempts at bringing that technology into Airsoft have been a disaster(See Airsoft GI's Parrot AR drone fail). CIAR is ready to bring a completely new dimension to the game we all love, adding in potential for innovative scenarios, such as IED disposal simulations.
As this is my Senior project, completing CIAR is very important to me. This project is graded for me. 
I've been a part of my school's Robotics Club for a couple years, now, and have automated R/C cars. I've built a deadmau5 mask with functional sound and lights, as well. This will be my first robotics project of this scale.
Other Ways You Can HepContributing is the best way to help out, but if you're unable to and still want to make a difference, share this campaign on facebook, twitter, google+, Tumblr, MySpace, etc. etc. etc. The more people who see this, the more funds come in. Simple formula, but it works!Thanks again for all your help, guys.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I would like to improve support for Nintendo's USB GameCube controller adapter on Windows/macOS/Linux. You may know it as the <a href=""https://www.gamestop.com/wii-u/accessories/wii-u-gamecube-adapter/115426"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wii U GameCube Adapter</a>, or the <a href=""https://www.gamestop.com/nintendo-switch/accessories/nintendo-switch-gamecube-controller-adapter/164548"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nintendo Switch GameCube Adapter</a>. I will do this by adding a special backend to <a href=""http://libsdl.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SDL</a>, via their HIDAPI-based joystick driver.</p>
<p>Right now there only exist platform-specific standalone programs that make virtual joysticks (such as <a href=""https://github.com/ToadKing/wii-u-gc-adapter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wii-u-gc-adapter</a>), or programs are writing low-level device support themselves (such as <a href=""https://dolphin-emu.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dolphin</a>'s built-in GameCube adapter support). By writing a driver in SDL, we introduce out-of-the-box support to an extremely large catalog of existing software for every major desktop platform without having to develop a driver for each one individually (some of which require expensive certificates and/or certification processes, in addition to having to install it for each user).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to carve out some time to actually work on this. I currently have two jobs; one as a <a href=""http://www.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=Portfolio/Ports"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">game porter</a> (platforms include Linux, macOS, Windows, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One), and another as a developer for <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steam Play</a> (also known as Proton). Both are very closely related to this project, but this is not essential for either of my jobs since no particular game requires it, so it's hard to justify the development cost to my clients.</p>
<p>That's where you come in. I made a <a href=""https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1095020011725484032"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">quick poll</a> asking if anyone would be interested in paying a small amount to help fund development, and quite a few people said they would! Let's hope those fine individuals see this campaign.</p>
<p>The goal is based on a system I've used in the past; I have a <a href=""https://github.com/flibitijibibo/flibitBounties"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bounty tracker</a> that I use to outsource projects that I need done <i>and</i> can have their costs justified to my clients. I use a system that measures projects in weekends, and typically I measure the cost at $500USD per weekend. So, I expect this to be a 3-weekend project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scribble together the HIDAPI driver, get at least one controller working</li>
<li>Get all four slots working, get SDL_Joystick enumeration to make sense</li>
<li>Clean everything up, submit to SDL Bugzilla for review</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, a review may lead to more stuff being requested by Sam or Ryan (the two SDL leads), but by that point the work should not be substantial. The real meat of the project is just getting anything written <i>at all</i>.</p>
<p>Once this is in revision control, you'll be able to take any game that uses SDL2, plug in your adapter, and play games with automatic configuration and full support for any hardware that the adapter supports. Like the rest of SDL, the code will be released under the zlib license, so it will always be free and open source for everyone to use and study for whatever purpose they like.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It sounds weird that I'm writing a driver in a library, rather than... well, a plain old driver, but consider this brief, not-even-close-to-complete list of products that currently use SDL's controller support:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://unity3d.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Unity3D</a> for Linux<ul><li>
<a href=""http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rewired</a> enables the use of SDL on Windows/macOS</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Unreal Engine 4</a> for Linux</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://fna-xna.github.io/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FNA</a> for Windows/macOS/Linux</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.monogame.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MonoGame</a> for Windows/macOS/Linux</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.winehq.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wine</a>'s (or Steam Play's) XInput implementation</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.retroarch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RetroArch</a> for Windows/macOS/Linux</li>
<li><a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Lots and lots of games are already using this, meaning the driver will be useful immediately. And the possibilities are endless! Super Hexagon with DK Bongos? <i>Check</i>. Sonic Adventure 2 via Proton with DK Bongos? <i>Double check</i>. Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator with DK Bongos? You bet your mint condition Club Nintendo Mobile Suit Gundam WaveBird that's a <i>check</i>.</p>
<p>Steam is the most interesting example, because not only do they use the SDL_GameController standard for configuration, but it also shares driver code with SDL in the form of their <a href=""https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steam Input</a> implementation. SDL's existing HIDAPI drivers come straight from Steam Input, and by developing a GameCube adapter driver under that same system, it may give Valve a starting point for adding official GameCube controller support in Steam Input! I don't know if they'll ever go as far as making DK Bongo graphics, but a man can dream...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have written code for SDL before. I've spent many many years making sure controllers work extremely well on PC across the 50+ games I've worked on. I'm already pretty familiar with how the adapter works. But it's not all rainbows and... uh, other rainbows.</p>
<p>Thankfully the adapter is very, very simple. In fact, initializing it is as simple as sending a 1-byte packet, with the number 0x13. Yeah, pretty crazy, right?</p>
<p>Less simple is the integration with SDL. Right now the HIDAPI driver assumes that 1 device is 1 controller. As you might expect, this adapter breaks that rule pretty hard! This means that if we want proper support for all 4 slots, with each slot only counting as an active joystick when something is plugged in, I'll have to rip up the driver's design a little bit. It's not impossible, just a little bit weird, and so far this is the only device that acts this way, so I'll need to make sure this works <i>really</i> well before sending it to Ryan and Sam for review.</p>
<p>And yes, this isn't a Linux kernel driver. I'm hoping this code will be useful to someone with more kernel development experience than me. I've made microscopically tiny patches for the kernel before, but even submitting a couple new hardware IDs to the kernel was a surprising amount of work! The SDL route reaches more platforms, is part of a widely-used codebase, and is in a project that I am already intimately familiar with, so this is more cost-effective.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Getting this campaign to be seen at all is 99% of the battle. It's a pretty low goal with a really low pledge minimum. Unlike most game-related crowdfunding campaigns, this is where even a small contribution gets you exactly what everybody else gets. And the contribution doesn't necessarily have to be a pledge! Share this wherever you like with anyone you think will enjoy being able to easily use their GameCube controllers on PC. For a project with no advertising budget, increasing visibility is extremely difficult and anything you can do to help with that is highly appreciated.</p>

I use a system that measures projects in weekends, and typically I measure the cost at $500USD per weekend. So, I expect this to be a 3-weekend project:

Scribble together the HIDAPI driver, get at least one controller working
Get all four slots working, get SDL_Joystick enumeration to make sense
Clean everything up, submit to SDL Bugzilla for review

Of course, a review may lead to more stuff being requested by Sam or Ryan (the two SDL leads), but by that point the work should not be substantial. The real meat of the project is just getting anything written at all.
Once this is in revision control, you'll be able to take any game that uses SDL2, plug in your adapter, and play games with automatic configuration and full support for any hardware that the adapter supports. Like the rest of SDL, the code will be released under the zlib license, so it will always be free and open source for everyone to use and study for whatever purpose they like.

The Impact
It sounds weird that I'm writing a driver in a library, rather than... well, a plain old driver, but consider this brief, not-even-close-to-complete list of products that currently use SDL's controller support:


Unity3D for Linux
Rewired enables the use of SDL on Windows/macOS


Unreal Engine 4 for Linux

FNA for Windows/macOS/Linux

MonoGame for Windows/macOS/Linux

Wine's (or Steam Play's) XInput implementation

RetroArch for Windows/macOS/Linux
Steam

Lots and lots of games are already using this, meaning the driver will be useful immediately. And the possibilities are endless! Super Hexagon with DK Bongos? Check. Sonic Adventure 2 via Proton with DK Bongos? Double check. Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator with DK Bongos? You bet your mint condition Club Nintendo Mobile Suit Gundam WaveBird that's a check.
Steam is the most interesting example, because not only do they use the SDL_GameController standard for configuration, but it also shares driver code with SDL in the form of their Steam Input implementation. SDL's existing HIDAPI drivers come straight from Steam Input, and by developing a GameCube adapter driver under that same system, it may give Valve a starting point for adding official GameCube controller support in Steam Input! I don't know if they'll ever go as far as making DK Bongo graphics, but a man can dream...

Risks & Challenges
I have written code for SDL before. I've spent many many years making sure controllers work extremely well on PC across the 50+ games I've worked on. I'm already pretty familiar with how the adapter works. But it's not all rainbows and... uh, other rainbows.
Thankfully the adapter is very, very simple. In fact, initializing it is as simple as sending a 1-byte packet, with the number 0x13. Yeah, pretty crazy, right?
Less simple is the integration with SDL. Right now the HIDAPI driver assumes that 1 device is 1 controller. As you might expect, this adapter breaks that rule pretty hard! This means that if we want proper support for all 4 slots, with each slot only counting as an active joystick when something is plugged in, I'll have to rip up the driver's design a little bit. It's not impossible, just a little bit weird, and so far this is the only device that acts this way, so I'll need to make sure this works really well before sending it to Ryan and Sam for review.
And yes, this isn't a Linux kernel driver. I'm hoping this code will be useful to someone with more kernel development experience than me. I've made microscopically tiny patches for the kernel before, but even submitting a couple new hardware IDs to the kernel was a surprising amount of work! The SDL route reaches more platforms, is part of a widely-used codebase, and is in a project that I am already intimately familiar with, so this is more cost-effective.

Other Ways You Can Help
Getting this campaign to be seen at all is 99% of the battle. It's a pretty low goal with a really low pledge minimum. Unlike most game-related crowdfunding campaigns, this is where even a small contribution gets you exactly what everybody else gets. And the contribution doesn't necessarily have to be a pledge! Share this wherever you like with anyone you think will enjoy being able to easily use their GameCube controllers on PC. For a project with no advertising budget, increasing visibility is extremely difficult and anything you can do to help with that is highly appreciated.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What We Need &amp; How we will spend it</h3> <p>These bullets will show you exactly what we will be spending the money on so you know its money well spent. a * indicates its optional and will only be spent if we have the resources and funding to.</p> <ul> <li>We need a minimum of $250 for an alpha release of the server.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>$125 - Go towards paying our developers who will make the custom plugins for the server.</li>
<li>$125 - will go to the costs of a VPS / Dedicated server to support the Alpha release.</li>
</ol>
<ul> <li>The next goal is the $500 goal</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>This will go towards developing more plugins for the server (%35 of profits)</li>
<li>Another portion will go towards the server hosting  (40% profits) </li>
<li>Will hire a small build team to build parts of the town (15% profits) *</li>
<li>Will add in story writers to create more interesting questing lines (10% profits)*</li>
</ol>
<ul> <li>The next goal is the $750  + goal<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>We will be able to host the server for 1 year minimum. </li>
<li>Have in many custom features and better builds as we can hire a team.</li>
<li>We will be able to get many new features added with a increase of the complexity of the plugins in which we will be able to provide.</li>
</ol>
<ul><li>If we don't reach the $250 goal</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>We will still continue with development of the server</li>
<li>Alpha testing group will be much smaller then we hoped</li>
<li>Less features will be implemented until the actual release of the server<br/>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why we need you</h3> <p>We wouldn't ask you for help, if we didn't think we needed it! Here are just a few reasons why we are looking for your assistance in the developing and producing the server.</p> <ul> <li>The cost of a server is expensive, because we are still in pre-stages of development, the cost of hosting the server is something that we don't want to interfere with the amount of money we can spend towards creating plugins and creating stories.</li> <li>We used to run a Garry's Mod Dark RP server and had a successful server with at least 120+ visits a day. We know how to manage a server and know where money should be spend in order to create the best possible server. </li> <li>You, the player, create the server. With out you there is no role-play experience or fun to have. We are going to make this server highly player interactive, such as groups, and instances (Dungeons) which require teams to complete. With your contribution, as well as your time on the server you will be helping us to create the best vanilla Minecraft server which can be made.</li> </ul>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges - Our Plan</h3> <p> Because this is a server their are many risk factors to take into account such as a feature not being added due to the client limitations in which the Minecraft client can not handle such as custom animations.</p> <ul> <li>We have already contacted popular plugin developers who said they will be willing to work with us on this project, some of those people have already created well known plugins. With the team that we have, we are more then qualified to overcome any challenge.<br/><br/>A ""*"" Means that we are still in the process of negotiating their involvement in the server.</li>

We can not have a successful server unless we have the right amount of players. To support a MMORPG of this scale which will include guilds, dungeons and maybe even raids will require as many people as possible.</li> <li>Method 1 : Word of mouth, when your in a Skype call or a friendly chat drop our link, their is no better advertisement then your word of mouth.</li>
<li>Method 2: Share, you can use the tools provided by Indiegogo to link this project to your twitter, Facebook and other social media.</li>
<li>Method 3: Like our upcoming pages and be active on our forums. This will show that people are interested in the server and will get more players to want to actually be apart of the server.</li> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Features list ~ Simplified <br/>
</h3>Flight Paths - Fly from town to town instead of warping<br/><br/>Quests - Quests will require you to kill, get items, speak to someone or something completely different.

With the usage of plugins the possibilities are endless. Today we introduce to you A Timeless World, a up and coming MMORPG built for vanilla Minecraft, so that you can join with ease and no complicated extra installations. Look below for in-game photos. Here is a little bit about us...  We have been making servers (across many games) for about 2 years with most of them being successful.  We currently are a small team looking to expand with a team of dedicated programmers, and level designers to enhance user experience With your contributions, we will be able to pay for the team and hardware that we need to provide you (the player) with the best content possible in the fastest time possible.  Our goal is to create a Minecraft server which will leave the player with the feeling of ""Wow, i have never played any other server like this before.""






Implemented & Planned Features
We have already spent many hours on the server, here you will be able to see a list of the features we already have implemented into the server.


GUI
 We wanted to implement the use of GUI to stop players from having the burden of remembering 100 commands while at the same time making everything look nice. In this picture you can see the main menu, Where under the help, you simply click the button and it will let an admin know that you are in need of assistance with no other commands on your part. The friends list is also GUI based so you can invite friends to a party, start private chats or remove a friend with the click of a mouse button.
NPC's







NPC's are in any good RPG and so that is why we have them here! As you see in the picture NPC's have tags so that you know what they do. A NPC who's with Quest will give a quest. You can chat with a NPC without using a command but simply type when you are near him and the server gives you possible responses, you can respond while within 3 blocks to trigger the next event. NPC's add looks and population to the server. Some of the NPC's you can see walking around town and others you can see who give out quest and so much more.


Environment

Thanks to the help of our lovely team, we have custom built terrain via world painter for Minecraft. We have realistic trees,  realistic rocks, and a wonderful terrain. You can explore the world without the weird Minecraft terrain feeling, but experience a realistic terrain in a Minecraft server. We will be having our own custom texture pack, for the server which will change items to better suit the server. This will not only affect the environment, but it will also affect the weapons system which will be implemented into our server. Look below for a better, view of the terrain.

Guild Base - Planned



We have all at some point and time played a game or server with factions and or guilds. We wanted to go above and beyond the original guild systems where you may only chat with and  group with your guild. We wanted to create a sort of system in which each guild will get their own base (instanced). On the base will be meeting rooms, and maybe even an option to add a blacksmith for armor repairs. This will allow for guilds to be more then just a tag you have but, be something to enjoy being in. The photo above shows and example of a Guild Hall layout design. 

PvP - Planned
Although it is a RP server we still think that players would enjoy a aspect of PvP. The first way we wanted to add it in would be Via War Zone events. Because we do not have the factions yet set up, War Zone teams will be random. A war zone is a game mode with a specific amount of player on each team. The factions would need to fight each other and the winning faction team will gain reputation for the victory, as well as receive War Zone credits, which you can use to purchase War Zone items. You will also be able to challenge someone when you are in the duel arena to a duel. You can choose which items can not be used during the duel, and set stakes to see who is the best on the server. These features will soon be implemented into the server and those changes will be reflected here. Also to be implemented will be a Wilderness area, when you die within the wilderness you will lose all of your items so be careful!

                                           Quests - Planned & Implemented
 Quests are already implemented into the server, but we want to add on to questing. We one wanted to create a quest log (either Via Command or in the Main Menu). The quest log will show your current quests and the objectives which you completed, and will also show you which tasks you have completed. We also wanted to utilize personal holograms for players so that people on certain quests can see things that others can not, without having to teleport the player to a world and phase him out of the original world.

                                                   Instances - Planned
Instances will be a important part of the server, this will allow multiple groups of players to do the dungeons at the same time as opposed to one group at a time. Instances will be comprised of different Mobs, as well as NPC's. This feature will be an easy and fun way to level up while competing with the environment and enjoying it with your friends. When you complete an instance you will all be rewarded with EXP (depending on the difficulty of the instance) as well as a random item (Depending on the difficulty).


Pets - Planned
Pets will be an important part to the server, their will be a pets and aggressive pets. Regular pets will be able to assist you with normal day to day tasks such as being another inventory for you, or turn your pet into a walking beacon of light so that your friends and players near by will know where you are. Aggressive pets are pets that will fight with you and level up to unlock more skills such as knock back. When you level up you pet it will gain more health, armor and deal more damage.








What We Need & How we will spend it These bullets will show you exactly what we will be spending the money on so you know its money well spent. a * indicates its optional and will only be spent if we have the resources and funding to.  We need a minimum of $250 for an alpha release of the server.


$125 - Go towards paying our developers who will make the custom plugins for the server.
$125 - will go to the costs of a VPS / Dedicated server to support the Alpha release.

 The next goal is the $500 goal


This will go towards developing more plugins for the server (%35 of profits)
Another portion will go towards the server hosting  (40% profits) 
Will hire a small build team to build parts of the town (15% profits) *
Will add in story writers to create more interesting questing lines (10% profits)*

 The next goal is the $750  + goal



We will be able to host the server for 1 year minimum. 
Have in many custom features and better builds as we can hire a team.
We will be able to get many new features added with a increase of the complexity of the plugins in which we will be able to provide.

If we don't reach the $250 goal

We will still continue with development of the server
Alpha testing group will be much smaller then we hoped
Less features will be implemented until the actual release of the server









    Why we need you We wouldn't ask you for help, if we didn't think we needed it! Here are just a few reasons why we are looking for your assistance in the developing and producing the server.  The cost of a server is expensive, because we are still in pre-stages of development, the cost of hosting the server is something that we don't want to interfere with the amount of money we can spend towards creating plugins and creating stories. We used to run a Garry's Mod Dark RP server and had a successful server with at least 120+ visits a day. We know how to manage a server and know where money should be spend in order to create the best possible server.  You, the player, create the server. With out you there is no role-play experience or fun to have. We are going to make this server highly player interactive, such as groups, and instances (Dungeons) which require teams to complete. With your contribution, as well as your time on the server you will be helping us to create the best vanilla Minecraft server which can be made. 




   Risks & Challenges - Our Plan  Because this is a server their are many risk factors to take into account such as a feature not being added due to the client limitations in which the Minecraft client can not handle such as custom animations.  We have already contacted popular plugin developers who said they will be willing to work with us on this project, some of those people have already created well known plugins. With the team that we have, we are more then qualified to overcome any challenge.A ""*"" Means that we are still in the process of negotiating their involvement in the server.



* Eniripsa96, the manager and author of popular plugins known as Skill API, Parties and MCCore as well as 4 others.

Supavitax, the manager and author of the plugin known as Item Lore Stats

* The01Guy, manager and author of plugins known as Points of Interest and Customs
Smeths, Manger and developer of Call of Minecraft + Call of Minecraft: Nazi Zombies

 With the input from the alpha tester who will report any bugs and the skills that the team has, we will be able to work quickly and efficiently to overcome any issue that we may seek. We will have back up servers to prevent any data loss as well as a forums in which alpha members can post there questions, comments and concerns and be answered by a developer.    Other Ways You Can Help We understand if you cant contribute with money, but you can still help out the development of the server.  Spread the word!This is the most important thing we can ask from you. We can not have a successful server unless we have the right amount of players. To support a MMORPG of this scale which will include guilds, dungeons and maybe even raids will require as many people as possible. Method 1 : Word of mouth, when your in a Skype call or a friendly chat drop our link, their is no better advertisement then your word of mouth.
Method 2: Share, you can use the tools provided by Indiegogo to link this project to your twitter, Facebook and other social media.
Method 3: Like our upcoming pages and be active on our forums. This will show that people are interested in the server and will get more players to want to actually be apart of the server.   Features list ~ Simplified 
Flight Paths - Fly from town to town instead of warpingQuests - Quests will require you to kill, get items, speak to someone or something completely different. (Daily / Repeatable quests will be available)Custom Items - Most of the armor is colored leather but with different stats thanks to Supavitax, we can make 100's of different armor types with leather alone.Spell system with hot keys - Cast spells by pressing a number on your keyboard (Bound to 3-7) when your hot bar is activated, it will instantly switch you back to your weapon so that you may continue to attack without having to worry about scrolling back.GUI Interaction - Talk to various shop keepers and see GUI display from shops, to the locations of flight paths and more.And Tons more, these are just some of the main ones.To Do
Mounts - so that players have faster ways of travel.
Guilds - Implementing a guild system with the guild achievement system as well as guild basing (in a instanced world)Instances - creating dungeons that can ran by different groups at the same time.

War Zone - Wars between factions and players in large amounts (20v20) (30v30).

Pets - Aggressive and helpful pets.
Multiple factions- To allow for competition.
GUI Achievements - An achievement system that will reward players based off the achievement. More Custom mobs - Such as the elemental bosses.Animate - Animate areas of the map including hidden doors and gates.

<p>In Kiss or Miss we follow Steve, a single college guy on his various dates with different girls. Each girl is very different in terms of appearance and personality. Steve needs to understand what they need, feel the vibe and make the right moves in order to finally kiss them. He can try various different routes to get to the kiss. He can try being macho, sophisticated, geeky, posh and a host of other strategies and if any one way doesn’t work he can just try again with a new tactic! If his approach is weird or inappropriate, the girls may get angry and even slap him or throw their drink at him. This is the magic of the game! Players control Steve's actions and if they do not succeed, they can replay the episode.</p>
<p>All parts of the game will be filmed by us. The script is already created for the first two episodes, which involve hilarious events and misfortunes on the journey of Steve to kiss two really hot girls! The game has also unique features like the Time Machine (which can let you reverse an action you believe will affect the final outcome) and the ""Love Doctor"", who offers you advice on how to approach each girl.</p>

During the game, Steve will try anything, including changing his tone of voice, his appearance or even his whole personality in order to impress and get closer to the girl and this is the magic of this game.</p>

Full 3d Graphics playable on a wide variety of Android and iOS phones and tablets ! Customize your House, Master and your ePet using a variety of shops in-game for Clothing, Skins and Accessories !

Explore a variety of locations and discover hidden items throughout the world, new ePets and foes to defeat on the go! Then head to the town to shop and buy supplies, customization options and more !

Enjoy several modes of play including Quick Battles with your ePets for experience, Meet and Greet with other eMasters , Photo Ops to share on facebook/twitter and much more !

Use objects collected while you explore to make new Items, Potions and much more ! Find materials to create new clothing and unlock new loot !

With a successful campaign, multiplayer modes will be added for Battle, Meet and Greets, Friendslist, Gifting and minigames ! Share your experiences with others via Facebook and Twitter !

Collect over a dozen fully 3d and animated ePets with much more to come, all with 2-3 different forms! Then feed them, train them, wash them and take care of them to make them more efficient in minigames and battle ! 


Epic Pets has been in developmentand we've done concept tweaks, gameplay changes and more to make sure that while presenting out project we have a game that people will enjoy.
With what we have so far we definitely have a solid experience on the phone underway but we're looking to expand it even further to reward the players with more game modes, multiplayer, new features and more !

With additional funding, Mini-Games will be included to make sure players will not only focus on battles and caretaking, but also on fun activities that they can enjoy with their eMaster and ePet ! Our first planned Mini-Game with additional funding is an item Crane Game !

Multiplayer is definitely the one component we'd like to share with everyone. Expanding the Meet & Greet, Combat, Photo mode, Leaderboards and more with multiplayer is our main reason for starting this campaign as it is our number one requested feature.

Hosting player information requires servers and with your help we'll be able to keep servers and multiplayer functionality running 24/7 all across the world !

With your help, we will increase the detail in our assets, use better mobile shaders and add in much more into the iOS and Android games!

The inclusion of more ePets is essential to making the overall experience more immersive as we take our roster from the 10-25 currently planned pets higher at every goal we reach !

I am a computer science student from Austria and in 2013 I discovered the enjoyment of developing games. I started with a completely free to play game and released the source code on GitHub. 
Some months ago I started my second game called Race Runners. It is a 2D run racing game for mobile devices which you are able to play offline or online with up to 10 players. It is now in its final phase and I am trying to earn some money to cover the costs and to enable further development.
I believe the outcome of this campaign and success of Race Runners will drastically influence my future life and job choice.

High funding?If this funding generates a lot more money I will add additional level packs and release Race Runners on more platforms.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Wait. Video Games to prevent Violence?</h3>
<p>Yes! And why not?</p>
<p>Not only do we know that the vast majority of young people play video games, video games have been shown to be very effective training tools and education resources. We are just using them to increase the knowledge of young people who are new to the world of dating and might not know the distinction between healthy and unhealthy behavior in a relationship.</p>
<p>One of the great aspects of video games is that they have the ability to transport players to alternate realities. For young people this provides an opportunity to experience - and learn from - actions and behaviors that might be dangerous in the real world. Video games provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Experiential learning</b>: Games allow students to experience something, not just read about it.</li>
<li>
<b>Discovery learning</b>: The flexibility of video games provide students the opportunity to explore a topic allowing them to recognize critical aspects of that topic on their own.</li>
<li>
<b>Contextualized learning</b>: Students learn about dating violence within the context in which it applies.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014 we wrote about our use of video games to prevent violence for the <i>Games for Health Journal</i>.

Although video games are sometimes blamed for violence in the Media, the truth is that like all forms of media they can be used for a variety of things! Since 2008 our nonprofit charity, Jennifer Ann's Group, has been producing video games to prevent teen dating violence. A few facts about us:

Jennifer Ann's Group is a registered charity which received its 501(c)(3) status from the IRS in 2006.

Since 2008 we have produced 22 video games designed to prevent teen dating violence. Our annual Game Design Challenge receives entries from around the world!
In June 2014 we launched our first ever Summer Game Jam which was held concurrently in Atlanta and Moscow!

Our video games and apps are available through Google Play, iTunes, BlackBerry World, Windows Phone, and Amazon appstores.



Coverage of our Efforts







We need your help


In order to continue producing these games - and to properly market them - we need funding. 

We want to localize these games for other markets (more languages + more countries = more prevention!).

We need help funding our own study showing how our games help prevent abusive relationships.




Wait. Video Games to prevent Violence?
Yes! And why not?
Not only do we know that the vast majority of young people play video games, video games have been shown to be very effective training tools and education resources. We are just using them to increase the knowledge of young people who are new to the world of dating and might not know the distinction between healthy and unhealthy behavior in a relationship.

<p>Do you like tricky puzzle games that will make your brain spin and get your „little grey cells“ occupied while you are on your way? With our new puzzle game JellyJiggle not only hardcore gamers will have a ball.</p>
<p>We would like to see the game to be available in summer 2013 at the Apple App store. The first to be released version will be for Apple iPad, iPhone and iPods only. After that, we would like to offer also a free-to-play Android version at the Google play Store.</p>

<p>In JellyJiggle it‘s all about moving delicious looking jelly blocks with a cute and wobbly cube named „Jay“ thru various environments into specific goals. Sounds like a no-brainer? Well, it‘s not! After the first easy to solve levels, the player gets confronted with tasks that will make his brain work overtime. The key to success in JellyJiggle is actually good logical and spatial thinking as well as the right tactics.<br/><br/> To get the most points and win the most stars, the player must push all jelly cubes into the correct goals using as little pushes as possible and finish each level in the least amount of time. If the player makes a wrong move, he can undo this by using so called „reverts“ to go back in time. At the end of each level, every push, the left over „reverts“ and the amount of time used will then be counted and the score calculated accordingly. Of course the player can always replay a level to raise his score as well.</p>

<h4>Q: Why Crowd funding?</h4>
<p>A: JellyJiggle has been in development for about 4 month now and, besides the limited resources, what makes the development process longer is balancing the production costs with the companies cash flow. With the support of crowdfunding we hope to secure our budget to release JellyJiggle without depending on other resources.</p>
<h4>Q: Why not try to find an investment somewhere else?</h4>
<p>Finding a sponsor for JellyJiggle was one of the first things we had in mind. But usually this also means the sponsor will tell you exactly how your game should be like. We don't want that to happen and rather do it the indie way.</p>
<h4>Q: Why IndieGoGo?</h4>
<p>A: We are a small company based in Germany and Kickstarter is yet not available to us. While KS is widely perceived to be the more influential source for video games funding, we still have faith that we can achieve our modest goal through IndieGoGo just as well.</p>

<h3 class=""big_type""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Thanks to our 18 contributors for their support!  This is a big game with big and new features.  We may be almost as far from our minum goal as we started, but our efforts will be to bring our 18 contributors an immersive scifi horror experience.  We have released the normal alpha which has taken me almost 4000 hours, but as i said before, Ghostship is designed for the rift.  Although this offers more than the small choice we have in 3d survival horror, I wanted ghostship to go above and beyond! If you have Oculus Rift then please donwload the demo of deck 3.  If you have contributed, email me for the full Oculus alpha and you will expereinece what I intended.  Ghostship is speciallay made for rift and with a pc/mac version with 3 diffferent viewing modes the pc version has not grabbed the attention we hoped and needed.  There is still a long way to go but rift owners will see why our game is made for rift!  Thanks for your support, we love you and you will have exclusive access all the way.  We will have delays as we are far from our minum goal, but it will be worth the wait!  Visit the Oculus forums for the Oculus alpha, or email us with same email you contributed with and we will send you the full alpha in the rift next week!</span></h3>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Why does Ghostship need your Help?</span></strong></p>
<p>There is still much development that is needed we have reached alpha 0.36 with only a couple of hundred pounds funding!  We have reached the stage where we need funding for the further development and completion of the game.  We want to publish Ghostship ourselves with your help and release it at less than £10, if we are unable to get enough funding to get don`t what we still need to do on the game,  then we will will have to look at other publishers which will probably increase the price of the game.  The more we get from crowd funding the less we need to seek privatley, help us to help you!</p>
<p><strong>What will the funding will be used for :</strong></p>
<p>Hardware - Computer equipment, for development and testing, Oculus Rift Dev Kit, controllers for set up, digital storage space etc.</p>
<p>Software - We need a variety of software and licenses for the devlopment and release of the game</p>
<p>Key devlopment Tasks - Parts of development we need to contact out such as voice acting, programming, gui, motion capture etc.</p>
<p>Marketing - The more we have for marketing the more we can promote the game and advertise it at gaming events, web &amp; social media.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reaching the goal</strong></p>
<p>Getting the minimum funding is our goal. The minimum funding is primarily for the final development and licensing which we need in order to release the game to you by the end of the year or early 2014! Compared to most games 25k is a tiny budget for a game of this scope. As we only need a minimal amount for essential voice acting, music, motion capture, equipment and licenses, we are asking for a fraction of the funds that most other games like this need!  We are trying to raise as much as we can through IndieGoGo and pre-orders, If we do not manage to reach the goal we will work hard to find alternative ways to raise the funds we need.  This will take longer and put devlopment behind shedule but it will not stop us from finishing the game.  </p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments then please FEEL FREE to post them, this is your game as much as it is ours!  Feedback is always welcome and can help shape the game to the way you want it!</p>
</div>
<h3> </h3></div>","Thanks to our 18 contributors for their support!  This is a big game with big and new features.  We may be almost as far from our minum goal as we started, but our efforts will be to bring our 18 contributors an immersive scifi horror experience.  We have released the normal alpha which has taken me almost 4000 hours, but as i said before, Ghostship is designed for the rift.  Although this offers more than the small choice we have in 3d survival horror, I wanted ghostship to go above and beyond! If you have Oculus Rift then please donwload the demo of deck 3.  If you have contributed, email me for the full Oculus alpha and you will expereinece what I intended.  Ghostship is speciallay made for rift and with a pc/mac version with 3 diffferent viewing modes the pc version has not grabbed the attention we hoped and needed.  There is still a long way to go but rift owners will see why our game is made for rift!  Thanks for your support, we love you and you will have exclusive access all the way.  We will have delays as we are far from our minum goal, but it will be worth the wait!  Visit the Oculus forums for the Oculus alpha, or email us with same email you contributed with and we will send you the full alpha in the rift next week!
 
 
 
OLD EDIT**We are in the last few minutes, even a miracle wont save Ghostship.  
With only 533 views in 60 days this game is another one of those games which was lost in the void.  There must be too many scifi free roaming, first person shooter/survival horror games with months of replay value, 5 game modes, multiplayer, 3 view modes and an oculus rift release! which have hidden our project from the worlds view.  I have put 4k hours into this project and lack of exposure wont stop me!
Prepare for more on ghostship, but lack of funding will mean delays!
For our contributers I thank you and you have contributed enough so we can get the oculus rift dev kit.  We have ghostship up and running and will be releasing an oculus demo shortly.  Our contributers will have exclusive access to the oculus rift (full alpha) and the first beta on halloween.  Thankyou.  We will be changing the final price of Ghostship over the next week and will resume pre-orders at the new price which will be confirmed next week. 
Why have we reached 1% of a very, very low budget goal?
 
Look what we are offering! Play the alpha/demo and see for yourself what we want to give you!
5 Game modes!

<p>A new raffle is under way for sponsors! Click <strong><a href=""http://lordsofimperium.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=230"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong> for more details!</p>
<h3>WHAT IS LORDS OF IMPERIUM?</h3>
<p>Lords of Imperium is a Live-Action Role-Play (LARP) game established by a community of players in and around Hornell, NY.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with the idea of ""LARPing,"" it is easily comparable to many popular tabletop games or online RPG’s. The difference, of course, is that with LARPing a player is physically present in an environment and actually actively participating in the events around them. Because of this, players should expect full and active immersion into a fantasy world. Players will be able to build characters and allow them to experience a world of adventure and excitement! Your decisions will direct your path, and your actions may dramatically impact those around you.</p>
<h3>THE WORLD OF IMPERIUM</h3>
<p>Lords of Imperium is set in a world of the same name. Imperium is a fictional world very similar to our own. A significant history has led the numerous nations of this world to their present states, with various nationalities squabbling for power and prestige.</p>
<p>While Lords of Imperium is certainly set in a fantasy genre, its universe lacks many of the typical “fantasy” accompaniments, such as the existence of “magic,” “spells,” and non-human races such as elves and dwarves. Your enemies will not be goblins or orcs, but rival families, factions, and nationalities, creating a much more real-world setting for players.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, Imperium is based very heavily on the Medieval period of our own world, and is meant to play out with a much heavier degree of “realism” than many other fantasy LARPs. Veterans of other LARPs may find a much darker and “grittier” experience within Lords of Imperium. As in most LARPs, combat will play a major role, but so too will the political, economic, and social machinations that make any historical period possible.</p>
<h3>OUR FUNDRAISING GOAL</h3>
<p>As a new group, we're looking to rally interest and establish ourselves as a regular event. Running a LARP takes time and money. It is most easily compared to directing a sporting event and a theater production... <em>at the same time!</em></p>
<p>While we'll typically charge admission, we're fundraising here on Indiegogo in the hopes that we can host a free first event in late September of this year. We want new players to be able to come without the obligation of fees and just enjoy a weekend of adventure.</p>
<p><br/>Such an event would require about <strong>$1000</strong> to host, and so that's what we're looking to fundraise...</p>
<div>
<h3>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</h3>
<p>Our <strong>$1000</strong> goal will go toward the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Site Fee at our established venue</li>
<li>Food and drink for participants</li>
<li>Some basic costuming elements</li>
<li>Props, make-up, etc. to run the first weekend</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that we're able to exceed our goal, any additional monies will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing printed copies of our Version 1.0 Rulebook</li>

<p><b>Technical details.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The car management and processing unit is a custom designed PCB board that sends and receives signals over the Ethernet network using mainly UDP Internet protocol. While UDP is considered to be unreliable because of its connection less nature this protocol ideally transmits time dependent data like video, audio and car control signals. The PCB board is also directly connected to a car engine and a wheeling system in order to control traction and steering wheel rotations. A single PCB with two Atmel microprocessors on board ensures that data transmission is performed with minimal delay and delivers best user experience.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the basic pledge of $12 you will get all of the initial run of 17 pdfs for Justice Wheels.</p>
<p>In addition, if there are enough folks who get commissions of their own characters from this fundraiser - we will do a 2nd run of Justice Wheels featuring those characters (with owner's permissions, of course.) Your initial pledge of $12 also entitles you <strong>to all of those pdfs</strong> as well.</p>
<p><strong>Confession Time:</strong> We need about $350 to defray most of the art costs. THAT is really our magic number.</p>
<p>We're asking for $500 - because that's the minimum amount IndieGoGo would allow.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS: If we reach the stated goal of 500</strong> - we will produce a special vehicle-centric short ICONS adventure</p>

In addition, if there are enough folks who get commissions of their own characters from this fundraiser - we will do a 2nd run of Justice Wheels featuring those characters (with owner's permissions, of course.) Your initial pledge of $12 also entitles you to all of those pdfs as well.
Confession Time: We need about $350 to defray most of the art costs. THAT is really our magic number.
We're asking for $500 - because that's the minimum amount IndieGoGo would allow.
BONUS: If we reach the stated goal of 500 - we will produce a special vehicle-centric short ICONS adventure

<h3>The Boy Game Interactive Website</h3>
<p>The Boy Game is a first of its kind interactive website that tackles bullying at its core:the cult of male toughness.  <strong>Michael Kimmel, Pulitzer Prize nominated author of Manhood in America says, ""if the conversation about bullying is going to advance, this is the project that will help us advance it""</strong>. We need to protect targets absolutely but to deal with the toxic  bully/target/bystander crisis we need to stop just vilifying bullies and begin to unpack the complicated dynamics the gets boys swept up in the dyanmics of bullying or watching in silent conflict. And violence breeds violence.  Victims are far more likely to become perpetrators.  This cutting edge site will be a free resource for educators nationwide to engage kids in a real discussion about the complex dynamics of the world boys live and how it could be different. <strong>How does this concern girls?  This project was started at the Ms. Foundation when they realized to create a safe world for girls they had to look at boys and traditional male culture that equates masculinity with toughess. </strong> This is a world where boys oppress girls and terrorize gay youth to prove their masculinity.  And girls need to be part of the conversation because they can either support the aggression or stand up against it.</p>
<p>Based on off-the-record interviews with boys nationwide, then fashioned into hard hitting scenarios, the scenarios are shot like a doc, to  capture the intense pressures boys face every day.</p>
<p>The site will provide a compelling, game like environment for educators to take middle and high school kids (boys alone and co-ed groups) to explore how the culture of toughness creates a platform for bullying and stops kids from standing up. </p>
<ul>
<li>It will allow users to go into the story from the unique perspective of each of the characters</li>
<li>Interactive comics will take users deep into the mind of a bully, a target and a bystander, showing how all are conflicted by both wanting to connect and to seem tough enough</li>
<li>Amazing doc interviews with diverse men and boys will shed light on the issues the scenes bring up</li>
<li>Kids will be able to upload their videos that reflect their take on the issues and their lives</li>
<li>A free downloadable study guide will frame the issues, help educators raise critical dialogue and will have creative exercises to bring home the issues emotionally and intellecutally, including helping kids create their own videos to be uploaded onto the site.</li>

<p><strong>Most importantly theboygame.org will be a free national resource</strong></p>
<h3>What we've done already</h3>
<p>We've shot and finished a 16 minute linear version of the project from the vantage point of the bystander that has just been accepted for distribution with New Day Films, the largest social issue distributor in the country.  But we're on indiegogo now raising money for the website because the website can do so many things a linear video can't including allowing users to go into through the POV of each of the characters and be a fee resource.</p>

<h3>Director/Producer Background/Track Record</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Deirdre Fishel and I have a 20 year history writing/directing dramas and documentaries.  My dramatic feature <em>Risk</em> premiered in competition at Sundance,  and was broadcast on 35 channels worldwide. My feature doc <em>Still Doing It</em> premiered at SXSW and was broadcast in 15 countries.  Now I’m  excited about a hybrid form in which I interview kids off the record to get at what happens behind closed doors, fashion a hard-hitting scenario that cuts to the meat of the issues, then improv the script with talented actors. The teen dating violence video I did using this technique won a Cine Golden Eagle.

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>
<p>We are looking to raise $25,000 to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoot the last 20% of the story assets, including powerful scenes that show boys struggling to organize and stand up, scenes that will provide a realistic tool kit for bystanders. </li>
<li>Develop the interactive comics with poignancy and humor that will get at the fears and fantasies all the characters have that lead to action and inaction</li>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>A tax deductible donation from our fiscal sponsor Women Make Movies</li>
<li>Knowing you are part of helping to look at bullying not from the vantage point of the roles boys play, which demonizes bullies, but from the vantage point of a culture that limits all boys</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The culture of toughness promoted in the media, by many coaches and even by some parents, equates masculinity with being silent and tough. Any other emotions are seen as ""feminine"" or ""gay"" and leave kids open to ridicule, even assault. Not only do LGBTQ kids suffer under this system, but all kids do. The fact of the matter is no one can fit into this box, because being silent and tough just isn't human.</p>
<p>Boys desperately need a way to talk about the painful gender straitjacketing to which they are subjected, in order to develop the resilience needed to stand up, be themselves and redefine masculinity in terms of emotional, tolerant strength.</p>
<p>The 16-minute video portion of this project has been accepted for distribution with New Day Films and will begin a massive national launch in August.</p>

<br/><p>l'Orphelinat also known as The Orphanage is a horror adventure game that takes place on a dark night in a countryside in a converted 16th century church.  You wake up in a field with no idea of who you are, where you are and what you are doing. Something seems to be guiding you or urging you to walk. As you come to a clearing you see the Church. Upon entering you find other children and quickly learn that things are definitely not right and appearances are not what they seem.  You don't know who to trust. </p>

We also have set precedent with the music of this game by being the first to execute the new agreement with the music union for video game music. This is really an important step in the history of video games as it is going to be the standard for most video games music scores going forward. This game is history in the making.

<p>Making a video game can be a very expensive thing. So far we have done everything in our power to make this game at zero cost. However we are at the stage where we need help from the community. Since this game is something of our passion we have made the choice to ask for funding. With things like recording sessions and paying for artists, equipment, and operating costs, we need help paying for it. Here is the breakdown:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Recording costs contribute to roughly 65% of our expenses. Our last recording session reached well into costing $12,000. We paid that out of our own pockets and it was worth every penny.</li>
<li>Artists and freelancers take another chunk of money. Freelancers charge us per hour to do a task or set of tasks. We have spent $3,000 on freelance work so far. This includes art and level design.</li>
<li>Equipment costs include software and licensing. This ranges from platform to platform. We can spend anywhere between $800 - $2500 to get a license for things like photoshop and protools to licenses for assets and permission to use published artwork.</li>
<li>So far we have spent $52,909.89 to make this game. We have an estimated $40,000 more to go.<b> Of that cost we are asking the community for half of that. </b>

<div>$10,000 to hire the orchestra to play the rest of the music (This is on top of what we currently are hiring to play using the newest contract from the music union)</div>
<div>$5,000 to hire a graphic artist for three months (This is to hire a new person and the work is not based on a 40 hour work week. It is based on the amount we were quoted for the project)</div>

<p>After our (kind of success) attempt with the first version - <i><strong>Tap Tap Reborn</strong></i>, we announced a new version called <i><strong>Tap Tap Reborn 2</strong></i>  to the community, with some significant changes. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Current Feature on Tap Tap Reborn 2:</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Streamed Popular Songs</strong></p>
<p>The old version does not allow us to put popular songs with full duration on it (only 45 seconds) because of <strong>copyright</strong> infringement. This issue has raised a storm of unsatisfied reviews in the App Store and Play Store about songs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://s38.photobucket.com/user/khanhgt94/media/GIF%20scroll%20song%20list_zpsuugzqwv2.gif.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt="" photo GIF scroll song list_zpsuugzqwv2.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e144/khanhgt94/GIF%20scroll%20song%20list_zpsuugzqwv2.gif"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p>However, the money to buy copyright licenses from famous artists is way too much for a small group like us. Streaming video directly from YouTube is a perfect direction for our current situation, even though players must connect to the Internet to play <i><strong>Tap Tap Reborn 2</strong></i>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, five new songs will be charted and added to the game every week..</p>

<p>The team will definitely <strong>stick to the plan</strong>, but in a much longer duration because of lacking resources.</p>
<p>This campaign’s purpose is to push the development process onto a powerful and appropriate pace.</p>

Welcome, we are Wolftech Studios, an Indie game studio currently working on War
Generals - Panzers and Tanks.


We are a team of
10 highly motivated programmers, graphic artists, sound- and game designers
with many years of experience developing software and games.
We are big fans
of old-school strategy games and want to revive them, adding modern features in
the process like talents for commanders and heroes.



What is War Generals?



Turn based hexagonal style strategy game.
Over 40 scenarios (including an Africa-Campaign and
fictional scenarios like Sealion and more) simulating the course of the Second
World War.
Varied scenarios with optional objectives: Defense
missions, Attack missions, Airborne landings, Amphibian operations etc.
5 campaigns for Axis and Allies.
Selection of over 500 ground-, air- and sea units.
Units gain experience in campaign mode and are
transferred from scenario to scenario.
Heroes and generals have comprehensive talent-trees.
Commander mode that gives the player experience and
talents.
Multi-language support: German and English. Support for other languages in the future.





All scenarios up to and including 1942 will be free-to-play (about 20 scenarios). All other
scenarios and campaigns will be available for purchase in our in-game shop later on.


War Generals runs on Java-compatible plattforms like Windows-PC's, Mac and Linux.




Actual screenshot of the game with temporary graphics (will be enhanced).

What We Need & What You Get


For nearly 2
years we’ve been developing War Generals and managed to create a final prototype with playable
scenarios!
The final prototype will be available later this month (october) since we are currently polishing it.
We however want
to devote more time to the project and for that we need your support.
The better you
like the game, and the more money we get, the more we can work on all the
amazing features of War Generals.
But the most important is – we will release this game in the end, be it as
our free-time project or as part of a full-time job!!!This is why we picked the “Flexible
Funding” type. We can use every cent we get to improve War Generals - Panzers and Tanks








We are currently working on


Improvement of map graphics and user interface
Design of scenarios and campaigns
Balancing units and scenarios



Game mechanics and programming are already done!


PerksThe Colonel perk and every thereafter gives you access to our final prototype, so you can try it out for yourself!
You receive exclusive founder units and bonuses. We will credit your invested money in the form of in-game money for all but the first perk.

The headset needed for our gaming purposes, is developed by NeuroSky and utilizes raw brainwave signals to control our gaming outcomes. We chose <em>NeuroMash</em> as our company name because we wanted to “mash-up” classical gaming with this unique and novel form of user interaction. We believe our new genre of casual “mind control” casino gaming will offer a ""disruptive"" level of user interaction right along with currently available traditional casual/social casino gaming. Just imagine using a ""mind trick” to beat the house in slots. Mind control casino gaming will offer gamers what they have always wanted, the power to self influence their odds of winning. Nothing captures the imagination like the power of the mind and playing our “mind games” in multiplayer environments, such as our upcoming “Neuropoker” game, will teach you how to hone your real-world poker skills and become a better competitor. We are asking you to join us at this critical moment in time for mind control technology and to “cross the chasm” with us!</span><p><span class=""""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/66486/files/20130709174731-Neuromash_10.jpg?1378855303"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We are currently at the beginning of the mind game evolution. This is a unique moment to join a brand new industry by helping us put this genre of technology on the gaming map!</p>
<p>First, we must work towards the Beta Release of NeuroSlot and our single player line of casino games. The beta release will be built through a cross platform strategy using Unity 4.2 and will interface with Neurosky’s MindWave and MindWave Mobile hardware. These will be released on Android, iOS, PC and Mac. For instance, you could view a detailed video description of our prototype for Neuroslot in the gallery section of this campaign. Upon the successful Beta completion, we plan on publishing “Neuroslot” (Slots mind game) followed by “Neurowar” (Casino Wars mind game), “Neurojack” (Blackjack mind game) and “Neuroulette” (Roulette mind game) on Neurosky’s gaming portal. The breakdown for the needed funds are as follows: $10,000 for platform development costs, $18,000 for game development costs and $22,000 for perk fulfillment costs. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.45em;"">Furthermore, each headset comes with several unique algorithms developed by NeuroSky including concentration, relaxation, blinks, task difficulty and task familiarity activities. To that effect, along with our single player line of casino mind games, we are currently working on an interactive social multi-player poker mind game. Just imagine playing Texas Hold ‘Em and although your opponents can’t see your cards, they can see your various biosignals. Yes, we are giving the online Poker enthusiasts what the “live players” have always had. “Tells!” For the first time ever, online poker players will have tells on their opponents. For instance, your opponents will be able to see both your own and your competitor’s level of relaxation and focus during the game.  In the process, you will learn to make better gambling decisions and become better online poker players. Neuropoker can become a valuable “learning tool” for live players! Live players can monitor their online playing activity while playing Neuropoker and learn how to control their real-world poker skills and become a better competitor. Please note that Neuropoker will be a web-based only game and will be offered on Neuromash.com in a multi-player environment.</span><br/></p>
<p><span class=""""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class="""">We are on Indiegogo because we know that this is the best way to get our “mind control” casino games in your hands as soon as possible! With all of the above in mind, we estimate we will need $50,000 for the launch of our initial single player casino mind games and initial development of Neuropoker and other upcoming multi-player mind control casino games.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>We have put a lot of time, funding and effort into our project but like many things in life not everything can be completed by just a few. You and your contribution will enable us to reach our goal. You will be a part of a world first in enabling us to complete production of our unique platform. If you believe in our futuristic vision of casino gaming, our passion, then please donate to this project! </p>

<p>The core Neuromash team includes Mehran, Daniel and Kevin. Our passion is cutting edge technology and we aim to integrate technology into our everyday activities in a natural and fitting way. Mehran and Kevin are life long friends working in the tech and business sector.They came across thought-controlled computer interface technology back in the fall of 2010 and eventually became infatuated by it. Dan joined the group in the following summer of 2011 right out of college with a fresh degree in computer science and somewhere along the way we combined our backgrounds in computer science and entrepreneurship to create Neuromash. We believe that “mind control” technology is in its infancy and will only make every day life more interactive and entertaining. That is why we are asking for your support. We are eager to listen to your feedback once you receive and play our single player casino mind games. Join us in creating this new genre of casino games and let’s share our novel vision with the world.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/66508/files/20130707204633-FAQ_full.png?1378855730"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What sort of emotional states can we use to play the single player line of games?</strong></p>
<p>A user will be able to set as concentration or relaxation as his or her desired emotional state to play the 4 casino single player games for now. As new algorithms for other emotional states are developed for the headset, we will include them into updates to the games for users to choose from.        </p>
<p><strong>Will you be adding new algorithms to Neuropoker?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we will be adding new algorithms to Neuropoker, as they become available to us. We strive towards giving online poker players insight into their psyche!</p>
<p><strong>Are the single-player line of games and Neuropoker purely brain controlled?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the games will be principally brain controlled. The only way a user can have an effect on his or her gaming outcome is by altering his or her emotional states. Players will be able to view his or her opponent’s emotional states as well as their own in these applications.</p>
<p><strong>Are the single player line of games and Neuropoker playable without the headset?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, they are playable without the headsets. But, they are no longer considered mind games and are back to being classic casino games. A mind control casino game is a casino game where the odds of the game are altered by a users emotional state “captured and analyzed” by the headset.One last note regarding classic casino gaming, we plan on eventually offering “mind control and classic casino gaming"" on Neuromash.com</p>

We chose NeuroMash as our company name because we wanted to “mash-up” classical gaming with this unique and novel form of user interaction. We believe our new genre of casual “mind control” casino gaming will offer a ""disruptive"" level of user interaction right along with currently available traditional casual/social casino gaming. Just imagine using a ""mind trick” to beat the house in slots. Mind control casino gaming will offer gamers what they have always wanted, the power to self influence their odds of winning. Nothing captures the imagination like the power of the mind and playing our “mind games” in multiplayer environments, such as our upcoming “Neuropoker” game, will teach you how to hone your real-world poker skills and become a better competitor. We are asking you to join us at this critical moment in time for mind control technology and to “cross the chasm” with us!





We are currently at the beginning of the mind game evolution. This is a unique moment to join a brand new industry by helping us put this genre of technology on the gaming map!
First, we must work towards the Beta Release of NeuroSlot and our single player line of casino games. The beta release will be built through a cross platform strategy using Unity 4.2 and will interface with Neurosky’s MindWave and MindWave Mobile hardware. These will be released on Android, iOS, PC and Mac. For instance, you could view a detailed video description of our prototype for Neuroslot in the gallery section of this campaign. Upon the successful Beta completion, we plan on publishing “Neuroslot” (Slots mind game) followed by “Neurowar” (Casino Wars mind game), “Neurojack” (Blackjack mind game) and “Neuroulette” (Roulette mind game) on Neurosky’s gaming portal. The breakdown for the needed funds are as follows: $10,000 for platform development costs, $18,000 for game development costs and $22,000 for perk fulfillment costs. 
Furthermore, each headset comes with several unique algorithms developed by NeuroSky including concentration, relaxation, blinks, task difficulty and task familiarity activities. To that effect, along with our single player line of casino mind games, we are currently working on an interactive social multi-player poker mind game. Just imagine playing Texas Hold ‘Em and although your opponents can’t see your cards, they can see your various biosignals. Yes, we are giving the online Poker enthusiasts what the “live players” have always had. “Tells!” For the first time ever, online poker players will have tells on their opponents. For instance, your opponents will be able to see both your own and your competitor’s level of relaxation and focus during the game.  In the process, you will learn to make better gambling decisions and become better online poker players. Neuropoker can become a valuable “learning tool” for live players! Live players can monitor their online playing activity while playing Neuropoker and learn how to control their real-world poker skills and become a better competitor. Please note that Neuropoker will be a web-based only game and will be offered on Neuromash.com in a multi-player environment.

We are on Indiegogo because we know that this is the best way to get our “mind control” casino games in your hands as soon as possible! With all of the above in mind, we estimate we will need $50,000 for the launch of our initial single player casino mind games and initial development of Neuropoker and other upcoming multi-player mind control casino games.
 




We have put a lot of time, funding and effort into our project but like many things in life not everything can be completed by just a few. You and your contribution will enable us to reach our goal. You will be a part of a world first in enabling us to complete production of our unique platform. If you believe in our futuristic vision of casino gaming, our passion, then please donate to this project! 
We would like to thank every backer for any contribution and any assistance in the realization of our project. Share our concept of translation of Neuromash among your friends and relatives on Facebook and Twitter and together we will bring Neuromash to life! 
If you have any questions or you just want to say hello, be sure to contact us on the comments section of our campaign. For Press Inquiries please contact Mehran Bagherzadeh at Mehran@neuromash.com
















The core Neuromash team includes Mehran, Daniel and Kevin. Our passion is cutting edge technology and we aim to integrate technology into our everyday activities in a natural and fitting way. Mehran and Kevin are life long friends working in the tech and business sector.They came across thought-controlled computer interface technology back in the fall of 2010 and eventually became infatuated by it. Dan joined the group in the following summer of 2011 right out of college with a fresh degree in computer science and somewhere along the way we combined our backgrounds in computer science and entrepreneurship to create Neuromash. We believe that “mind control” technology is in its infancy and will only make every day life more interactive and entertaining. That is why we are asking for your support. We are eager to listen to your feedback once you receive and play our single player casino mind games. Join us in creating this new genre of casino games and let’s share our novel vision with the world.


What sort of emotional states can we use to play the single player line of games?
A user will be able to set as concentration or relaxation as his or her desired emotional state to play the 4 casino single player games for now. As new algorithms for other emotional states are developed for the headset, we will include them into updates to the games for users to choose from.        
Will you be adding new algorithms to Neuropoker?
Yes, we will be adding new algorithms to Neuropoker, as they become available to us. We strive towards giving online poker players insight into their psyche!
Are the single-player line of games and Neuropoker purely brain controlled?
Yes, the games will be principally brain controlled. The only way a user can have an effect on his or her gaming outcome is by altering his or her emotional states. Players will be able to view his or her opponent’s emotional states as well as their own in these applications.
Are the single player line of games and Neuropoker playable without the headset?
Yes, they are playable without the headsets. But, they are no longer considered mind games and are back to being classic casino games. A mind control casino game is a casino game where the odds of the game are altered by a users emotional state “captured and analyzed” by the headset.One last note regarding classic casino gaming, we plan on eventually offering “mind control and classic casino gaming"" on Neuromash.com",14.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Beginning of Summer 2012 he came across an opportunity to be part of the 19th Maccabiah Games in Israel 2013, representing Canadian Cricket Team. He knew it is not going to be easy and for him the biggest motivation he got was from his wife, his son and his colleagues, who supported him and encouraged him to go ahead and give it a shot. After giving a lot of thought he registered for the Tryouts.</p>
<h3><strong>Levi is honored and excited to have qualified and have been chosen to represent Canada in the sport of Cricket at the 19th Maccabiah Games, held July 2013 in Israel, the 3rd largest sporting event in the world.</strong></h3>

counting rolls on error checks which varies by season) of plays are resolved in
1 die roll and no play takes more than 2 rolls. A game of <b>Pine Tar Baseball

The league batting average for that year was .292 and teams scored 5.9 runs per game on average. This makes for some wild and crazy games. Then it happens to be Honus Wagner's rookie season of what turned out to be an illustrious 21 year Hall of Fame career.<br/><br/><i>The 1889 and 2014 seasons are also available for the game.

<p><b>Pine Tar Baseball - 1897 </b>will feature 12 teams from the NL which was
the only pro league that season. Roster sizes vary from 15 to 17 players per
team for a total of 199 players. </p>
<p>The player stats are color printed on sheets. Nine players maximum per
sheet. The stats have an appearance of a card with a border around each player,
but they are not cut out individually. Each team will have 2 player sheets with
the 2nd sheet including the suggested starting line up for that team. </p>
<p><b>Pine Tar Baseball - 1897</b> will roll out a new<i> 'base on balls/strike out</i>' pitcher rating that makes pitcher performances more unique. Other features include base stealing, errors, sacrifice

More importantly, there was nothing even close when it came to how to relate a child's activity and how to reward them with things that they care about. Have you ever tried to tell an 8 year to put down there phone and get outside to play because they will live longer and have a happier and healthier life? Not!</p>
<p>As parents, educators and health care providers we realize the importance of staying healthy.  But when kids are 5 - 15 yrs old, all they care about are games, phones and their media. And, who can blame them, they are awesome!  So we thought, why not throw the activity tracker concept out the window and develop a ""game key"" that rewards kids with game credits and access to levels and features all powered by their physical activity, healthy habits, good deeds, grades, chores, etc.</p>
<p>To start, we decided to update the old ""virtual pet"" concept by allowing kids to harness their ""real life"" physical activity in order to drive the health of their ""virtual pet"" through a smartphone app. Each day they would have to reach there goals or their pet would look sad and sleepy, and really happy if they achieved their goal.  We also decided that we should allow the kids to push those steps into other games, (through our API) and to drive features and functions within those games. And, if this proves successful, we'll launch other modules for chores, grades and other good deeds either by building it ourselves or through an API integration with a 3rd party company.</p>
<p>Over a year ago, we assembled an awesome team of industrial designers and consumer product experts, as well as software and hardware developers from around the world that we have worked with on other projects throughout the years.</p>

More importantly, there was nothing even close when it came to how to relate a child's activity and how to reward them with things that they care about. Have you ever tried to tell an 8 year to put down there phone and get outside to play because they will live longer and have a happier and healthier life? Not!
As parents, educators and health care providers we realize the importance of staying healthy.  But when kids are 5 - 15 yrs old, all they care about are games, phones and their media. And, who can blame them, they are awesome!  So we thought, why not throw the activity tracker concept out the window and develop a ""game key"" that rewards kids with game credits and access to levels and features all powered by their physical activity, healthy habits, good deeds, grades, chores, etc.
To start, we decided to update the old ""virtual pet"" concept by allowing kids to harness their ""real life"" physical activity in order to drive the health of their ""virtual pet"" through a smartphone app. Each day they would have to reach there goals or their pet would look sad and sleepy, and really happy if they achieved their goal.  We also decided that we should allow the kids to push those steps into other games, (through our API) and to drive features and functions within those games. And, if this proves successful, we'll launch other modules for chores, grades and other good deeds either by building it ourselves or through an API integration with a 3rd party company.
Over a year ago, we assembled an awesome team of industrial designers and consumer product experts, as well as software and hardware developers from around the world that we have worked with on other projects throughout the years.
We really hope that you'll become as excited about this concept as we are and we hope to engage your support.

</p><p>Fenix is a full
color gaming magazine from the cold north: Sweden. Six times a year for the
past decade we have released a new printed magazine full of gaming material,
reviews, interviews and even our very own comic strip. The magazine has only
been released in Sweden, and most of the material has subsequently been in
Swedish only.</p>
<p>The name
Fenix is the Swedish version of “phoenix”. We thought it was a good
name since we – Anders &amp; Tove Gillbring - had just finished working on another
magazine for a Swedish gaming organization. The phoenix reference felt
appropriate, since the end of that previous magazine did not mean we were dead
and gone – quite the opposite. After a couple of years doing a magazine for
somebody else, and having to prioritize news from the organization above gaming
material it was a treat to be our own bosses and make all of the executive
decisions on the content.</p>
<p>The last three years we have included material
in English as well, since Kenneth Hite started spoiling our readers with writing a
brand new article to every issue (in the tradition of his Suppressed
Transmissions). Last year we added Pete Nash to our mix, providing material for
RuneQuest 6 (in the tradition of RuneRites).</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/339490/files/20140130150203-Header_our-goal.jpg?1391122923"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>We want to
celebrate our first decade as a gaming magazine by releasing our best gaming material
over the years – but this time all in English. In order to make it more
accessible for an international audience, we have excluded all material to games
only available in Swedish. The language in the printed books will have gone
through a proper English filter as well, thanks to Pete Nash and Jessica
Augustsson – both gamers with English as their first language.</p><p>It was hard
to make the selection, but after hours of agony we decided to reach
for the stars and go for three volumes from the start. Every volume will consist
of at least one stand alone card- or board game, a couple of articles by the
always impressive Kenneth Hite and at least one longer material (often printed
in black and white in the original), such as an entire role playing game,
campaign or setting. Last, but not least, Birger Barbaren, the very funny comic
strip Åke Rosenius creates to every issue of the magazine.</p><p>Every
volume will be available in three different formats: as a pdf-file, in soft
cover or in a Deluxe edition (hardcover, inserts with gaming props printed on
thicker paper and additional illustrations)</p><p>We have a
wealth of material to choose from, and hope to be able to extend the scope of
what we release with new articles along the way – as different stretch goals
are reached. 
When you participate in our crowdfunding you
will get special perks. Every time we reach $5.000 we will add a new article to
a Bonus Anthology in pdf-format.<br/><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/482857/files/20140403233540-Next_stretch-goals_15000.jpg?1396593340"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>We have now
unlocked Master Your Style by Tomas Alvin for Volume 1. The next stretch goal is The Devils Ship by Kenneth Hite to Volume 2 as well as a new bonus article to the pdf. <br/></p>
<p><b></b>
</p><p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b>
</p><p><b>The Devil’s Ship </b>–Kenneth
Hite’s campaign material is suitable for any game of modern horror. The Devil’s
ship is a strange, but yet eerily familiar and with a cargo of sins.</p>
<p><i>“From the mastheads to keel<br/>
She's a vessel surreal<br/>
It's one hell of a trip<br/>
On the black devil ship, aye!”</i></p>
<p><span>  -- Iron Mask, “The
Black Devil Ship”</span></p>
<p>The waves
surge, lightning breaks. Winds blow hard from the icy north, or hot from the
tropic south. Lit by balefire, it crests the surf and rides down into the
rollers, sheets snapping in the storm. Only the Devil’s ship could survive this
night, as it has survived every night like this for centuries. If your ship
sees it, your ship will wreck. If you hear a hail or a crackling radio message
from its crew, you will die at sea maddened by the dark knowledge you were
granted. The steel of the ship’s hull seems to steam under the lashing rain, as
though the rivets were red-hot. Sonar and radar go mad, as though the ship was
never there or loomed vastly, the size of an island.</p>
<p>They say
that at night, if you sell your soul in the right way, mark it in the correct
ledger or click the right box on the nameless website, you will receive a bill
of lading. Your drayage is paid, or more likely you must sell everything you
value to reclaim it. Because that bill lets you onto the docks where a
twenty-foot steel box waits holding your heart’s darkest desire. Or perhaps the
box shows up in a vacant lot, delivered by a black Peterbilt truck that
unhitches and drives away before you can see the driver. But you know where the
box is – and you must kill to make sure nobody can take it from you. Anything
you want is in that box. Everything you want is in that box.</p>

We will now start adding new articles. We will first add
one title in Volume 1, then one in Volume 2 and finally get to Volume 3 –
 and
then go back to volume 1 and keep adding new articles. If the campaign

owned and published by the married couple Anders and Tove Gillbring. We have
taken an active part in the Swedish gaming community almost, but not quite since the very beginning. In 1989 Anders published the first edition of the old west
role-playing game Western (and the fourth edition of Western will be out this
spring). Anders Gillbring is Fenix’ AD, the man behind the design of the
magazine. Tove Gillbring is the editor in chief and copyrighter. Lukas Thelin
is our inhouse illustrator, and his artwork has been a part of Fenix in every
single issue ever released. Still, we could never have done it on our own.
Fenix is the result of a collaborative effort from the Swedish gaming community
and we are grateful to all the talented people that have participated in the
magazine over the years. <br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/385983/files/20140221163738-Header_risks.jpg?1393029458"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If you support
our crowdfunding you will be receiving what you ordered, whether it was a
pdf-file, a softcover or hardcover book. We will finalize all of three volumes,
no matter what. If we do not reach our goal (which we sincerely wish to avoid)
we will be stuck with the higher printing cost of digital print in order to
provide what we promise. If we reach our goal we be able to make a longer print
run and thus hopefully be giving Best of Fenix a longer life span, making it
easier to access at a later date as well.</p>
<p>We got a
huge advantage compiling the anthologies to Best of Fenix. All the articles we
have chosen already exist. Most of them have previously been printed in
Swedish, but some were in English the first time around as well. We will not
have to wait for artwork either, since the illustrations were published with
the articles the first time around. We have chosen to include material that
have received high praise when printed in the Swedish gaming magazine Fenix, so
it is a selection based on actual feedback from our readers. Some authors as
well as illustrators included have been allowed to make a touch up of their
original material, thus providing a higher quality this second time around.</p>
<p>When we
planned Best of Fenix we decided on 27 stretch goals. We have allotted time for
these articles to be translated and edited as well in order to reach our
deadline. Should the crowdfunding roll beyond that we will be adding a brand
new volume to the mix. We hope you will forgive us if that additional title
will have a later release date than the first three.</p>
<p>During
Fenix’ first decade the magazine has never missed a deadline, and we don’t
intend to break that cycle with these three volumes. We have vast experience in
working with printing and distribution partners in Sweden, which we hope will
benefit the upcoming books as well. The risk of printing errors and delays
caused by bad printing files are minimal. </p>
We are currently in the process of translating
the articles included (and even some we hope to be able to unlock as
stretchgoals). We are willing to let that take some time, and thus not promise
to deliver the books until the end of 2014. We are eternally grateful to
Jessica Augustsson and Pete Nash, who are skilled as well as kind enough to
make sure that the texts you will be receiving won’t be riddled with as many
flaws as our texts here on indiegogo.<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/385985/files/20140221163839-Header_FAQ.jpg?1393029519"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

you can find the most common. If you have any additional questions, please ask
under the Comment section of our campaign.</p>
<p><b><span>1.<span>  </span></span>Why is the shipping cost so high?</b></p><b>
</b><p>Unfortunately
the cost of shipping books from Sweden is crazy high. We are very sorry for
this, not the least since it jacks up the total cost of our volumes more than
we would like. If you find the shipping cost too steep, we do understand if you
go straight for the pdf-files instead. </p>
<p><b><span>2.<span>  </span></span>What will happen if you don’t reach
your goal?</b></p>
<p>All
funders will receive the perks they have choosen, but we won’t be able to make
a full print run and thus settle for digital print (another way of printing –
you will still get a softcover or hardcover book if that was your wish).</p>
<p><b><span>3.<span>  </span></span>Have you considered releasing the
best material to Swedish games?</b></p>
<p>To
begin with, the less narrow selection felt better. Still, if the interest is
high enough we sure hope to be able to provide it.</p>
<p><b><span>4.<span>  </span></span>I have all of the Swedish magazines
already. Why should I fund this project?</b></p>
<p>You
wish to get the best material compiled together in books as well. Or as a
pdf-file, since we have not released them before. Or just
to see the brushed up illustrations or extended texts included. But no, this
will be the best material already printed in the Swedish magazine. It will not
be brand new material.</p>
<p><b><span>5.<span>  </span></span>I heard you got gamerfriendly
reviews, but I cannot find them in any in your proposed volumes?</b></p>
<p>Correct.
We went straight for the gaming material, not making reviews, previews or even
interviews part of the selection.</p>

color gaming magazine from the cold north: Sweden. Six times a year for the
past decade we have released a new printed magazine full of gaming material,
reviews, interviews and even our very own comic strip. The magazine has only
been released in Sweden, and most of the material has subsequently been in
Swedish only.
The name
Fenix is the Swedish version of “phoenix”. We thought it was a good
name since we – Anders & Tove Gillbring - had just finished working on another
magazine for a Swedish gaming organization. The phoenix reference felt
appropriate, since the end of that previous magazine did not mean we were dead
and gone – quite the opposite. After a couple of years doing a magazine for
somebody else, and having to prioritize news from the organization above gaming
material it was a treat to be our own bosses and make all of the executive
decisions on the content.
The last three years we have included material
in English as well, since Kenneth Hite started spoiling our readers with writing a
brand new article to every issue (in the tradition of his Suppressed
Transmissions). Last year we added Pete Nash to our mix, providing material for
RuneQuest 6 (in the tradition of RuneRites).We want to
celebrate our first decade as a gaming magazine by releasing our best gaming material
over the years – but this time all in English. In order to make it more
accessible for an international audience, we have excluded all material to games
only available in Swedish. The language in the printed books will have gone
through a proper English filter as well, thanks to Pete Nash and Jessica
Augustsson – both gamers with English as their first language.It was hard
to make the selection, but after hours of agony we decided to reach
for the stars and go for three volumes from the start. Every volume will consist
of at least one stand alone card- or board game, a couple of articles by the
always impressive Kenneth Hite and at least one longer material (often printed
in black and white in the original), such as an entire role playing game,
campaign or setting. Last, but not least, Birger Barbaren, the very funny comic
strip Åke Rosenius creates to every issue of the magazine.Every
volume will be available in three different formats: as a pdf-file, in soft
cover or in a Deluxe edition (hardcover, inserts with gaming props printed on
thicker paper and additional illustrations)We have a
wealth of material to choose from, and hope to be able to extend the scope of
what we release with new articles along the way – as different stretch goals
are reached. 
When you participate in our crowdfunding you
will get special perks. Every time we reach $5.000 we will add a new article to
a Bonus Anthology in pdf-format.We have now
unlocked Master Your Style by Tomas Alvin for Volume 1. The next stretch goal is The Devils Ship by Kenneth Hite to Volume 2 as well as a new bonus article to the pdf. 



The Devil’s Ship –Kenneth
Hite’s campaign material is suitable for any game of modern horror. The Devil’s
ship is a strange, but yet eerily familiar and with a cargo of sins.
“From the mastheads to keel
She's a vessel surreal
It's one hell of a trip
On the black devil ship, aye!”
  -- Iron Mask, “The
Black Devil Ship”
The waves
surge, lightning breaks. Winds blow hard from the icy north, or hot from the
tropic south. Lit by balefire, it crests the surf and rides down into the
rollers, sheets snapping in the storm. Only the Devil’s ship could survive this
night, as it has survived every night like this for centuries. If your ship
sees it, your ship will wreck. If you hear a hail or a crackling radio message
from its crew, you will die at sea maddened by the dark knowledge you were
granted. The steel of the ship’s hull seems to steam under the lashing rain, as
though the rivets were red-hot. Sonar and radar go mad, as though the ship was
never there or loomed vastly, the size of an island.
They say
that at night, if you sell your soul in the right way, mark it in the correct
ledger or click the right box on the nameless website, you will receive a bill
of lading. Your drayage is paid, or more likely you must sell everything you
value to reclaim it. Because that bill lets you onto the docks where a
twenty-foot steel box waits holding your heart’s darkest desire. Or perhaps the
box shows up in a vacant lot, delivered by a black Peterbilt truck that
unhitches and drives away before you can see the driver. But you know where the
box is – and you must kill to make sure nobody can take it from you. Anything
you want is in that box. Everything you want is in that box.
 








We will now start adding new articles. We will first add
one title in Volume 1, then one in Volume 2 and finally get to Volume 3 –
 and
then go back to volume 1 and keep adding new articles. If the campaign 
goes well enough, we will of course reach a point where we add a fourth 
volume in the ""Best of Fenix""-series.
To celebrate getting fully funded we will add a new article to the Bonus PDF that all funders
 will receive, no matter which perk you have chosen. Every
time we reach a full $5.000 in funding we will add a new article to a Bonus
Anthology in pdf-format, only available to the funders of this campaign.

You will be
able to buy each volume separately, but if you buy them all you will get
a better price. All volumes of Best of Fenix will be available in three
different formats: as a pdf-file, in softcover or in a Deluxe edition
(hardcover, inserts with gaming props printed on thicker paper and additional
illustrations).If you buy a
physical copy of any of the books, you will also get thanked in that volume.Every time
we reach a full $5.000 we will also add a new article to a Bonus Anthology in
pdf-format, only available to the funders of this campaign.
Shipping to
Sweden is included. For delivery to the US, Canada or Europe, please add $10 if
you buy a single book or $20 if you buy all three volumes at the same time.
Shipping to other parts of the world will be $15 for one title, or $30 for all
three.Fenix is
owned and published by the married couple Anders and Tove Gillbring. We have
taken an active part in the Swedish gaming community almost, but not quite since the very beginning. In 1989 Anders published the first edition of the old west
role-playing game Western (and the fourth edition of Western will be out this
spring). Anders Gillbring is Fenix’ AD, the man behind the design of the
magazine. Tove Gillbring is the editor in chief and copyrighter. Lukas Thelin
is our inhouse illustrator, and his artwork has been a part of Fenix in every
single issue ever released. Still, we could never have done it on our own.
Fenix is the result of a collaborative effort from the Swedish gaming community
and we are grateful to all the talented people that have participated in the
magazine over the years. 
If you support
our crowdfunding you will be receiving what you ordered, whether it was a
pdf-file, a softcover or hardcover book. We will finalize all of three volumes,
no matter what. If we do not reach our goal (which we sincerely wish to avoid)
we will be stuck with the higher printing cost of digital print in order to
provide what we promise. If we reach our goal we be able to make a longer print
run and thus hopefully be giving Best of Fenix a longer life span, making it
easier to access at a later date as well.
We got a
huge advantage compiling the anthologies to Best of Fenix. All the articles we
have chosen already exist. Most of them have previously been printed in
Swedish, but some were in English the first time around as well. We will not
have to wait for artwork either, since the illustrations were published with
the articles the first time around. We have chosen to include material that
have received high praise when printed in the Swedish gaming magazine Fenix, so
it is a selection based on actual feedback from our readers. Some authors as
well as illustrators included have been allowed to make a touch up of their
original material, thus providing a higher quality this second time around.
When we
planned Best of Fenix we decided on 27 stretch goals. We have allotted time for
these articles to be translated and edited as well in order to reach our
deadline. Should the crowdfunding roll beyond that we will be adding a brand
new volume to the mix. We hope you will forgive us if that additional title
will have a later release date than the first three.
During
Fenix’ first decade the magazine has never missed a deadline, and we don’t
intend to break that cycle with these three volumes. We have vast experience in
working with printing and distribution partners in Sweden, which we hope will
benefit the upcoming books as well. The risk of printing errors and delays
caused by bad printing files are minimal. 
We are currently in the process of translating
the articles included (and even some we hope to be able to unlock as
stretchgoals). We are willing to let that take some time, and thus not promise
to deliver the books until the end of 2014. We are eternally grateful to
Jessica Augustsson and Pete Nash, who are skilled as well as kind enough to
make sure that the texts you will be receiving won’t be riddled with as many
flaws as our texts here on indiegogo.

<p>The 'Creating Worlds' Panel at E3 with Neil deGrasse Tyson, James Gunn, Randy Pitchford, Kiki Wolfkill, and moderator Chris Hardwick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The funding goal via our crowdfunding campaign will not cover the financial requirements to develop Space Odyssey. </b></p>
<p>The team behind Space Odyssey initiated the conceptualization process of the game through self-funding, then sought outside funding that's earmarked towards development. </p>
<p>The funds received via your support on crowdfunding will grant us the ability to have this community play the game and engage with it while the final build is underway.    </p>
<p>As the crowdfunding gaming community begins to beta test game-play and provide feedback, we can begin to use the funds raised via crowdfunding to incorporate your modding, mapping and building suggestions, together building the awesome gaming experience you helped to create. </p>

Everything starts at Infinity Command, a massive undertaking by the 'Galactic Coalition' over many years.
Infinity Command is a gargantuan space station and the center-point of humanity’s galactic expansion.
As the newest Astro-Explorer in the Galactic Coalition, you've been tasked to explore the universe and build a new solar system for humanities galactic expansion. 
Your journey begins at Infinity Command in the not-so-distant future. You are one of the explorers and pioneers to join a new age of space travel.

Infinity Command is a gargantuan space station and the center-point of humanity’s galactic expansion.
From your home base at Infinity Command, you'll pilot your spacecraft to set out on missions and challenges.
 
As you set off on missions, our team of scientists will provide information and challenges to help you accomplish your goals. They can also be your lifeline, providing guidance when you run into life-threatening situations
From here, you can embark on exploration missions to the planets in our ever-expanding universe, starting in our immediate galactic neighborhood with the exoplanet named Proxima B.

Before customizing your spacecrafts, you'll need to learn the mechanics of game-play and the new physics of this created world.
Use simulations to practice without the risks you’ll face when you get into space.
For those who have less experience in gaming, the simulations you’ll go through in training will act as a tutorial- showing you all the things different you can do in the game.
You’ll learn what is expected of you as an astro-explorer and use simulations to practice without the risks you’ll face when you get into space. From here you will need to equip yourself for complete astro-explorer play.

The first stop on our journey of exploration is Proxima B, the closest known exoplanet to the Solar System, about 4.2 light years from Earth. 
When its red star sets and you look up into its night sky, it may seem quite familiar to our home planet.
 
It is the educated guess from the world's best physicists, climatologists, and planetary scientists as to what we will find when we visit. Proxima B was just discovered in 2016 and is in our immediate galactic neighborhood, so we have an idea of what to expect.
The mysterious landscapes of Proxima B come to life, allowing you to witness natural physics spectacles from a distance or interact with them up close.
    

Get rewarded as you complete missions, explore planets, encounter civilizations, and mine resources.
Create Biomes, landscape, cultivate a world where your lifeforms and colonists can thrive.
Upon creating your home planet, you'll be tasked with modding your civilization's spacesuits, spacecraft, and more.
 

 
Each planet is unique in Space Odyssey and grounded in real science with the chemistry that you input.

Create your own planet by inputting the specific chemistry that will allow the planet (and life) to form.
Once you start the planetary creation process, there is no going back; you are responsible for the planet you create.
On your home planet, you'll cultivate flora and fauna to gain an understanding of how life adapts and what species require to thrive and survive. From there, you'll create biomes and landscapes for your lifeforms and habitants.

Upon the creation of your planet's chemical makeup, you now have to shape it while it's still in it its formative stage.

Create and test A.I. Robot Assistants and Satellites to monitor threats.
In your lab and simulations, you’ll learn what is expected of you as an Astro-Explorer and use simulations to practice without the risks you’ll face when you get into space.
While your planet is in its formative stage you can experiment with its composition and simulate how that might be altered: Atmospherically, Topographically, Geographically, Biologically, Chemically and more.
Once you’ve hit on something that works for you in the lab you may actualize it on the world you are building.

The experiments that you've been conducting within the lab can now be actualized with the help of Artificial Intelligence.

Your artificial intelligence will guide you to create Robot Assistants to assist in building colonies, sustaining life forms, and more.
As Neil is a busy man and cannot always be there, your A.I. will provide you with tactical and logistical support, always on your side no matter the outcome.

As your colonies, resources, and innovation grows, so will your trade with others.

​Trading outpost are located throughout the galaxy.
Convert rewards you've earned in mission challenges, trade objects mined, and technologies you've discovered at trading posts located throughout the galaxy.
As the game expands, so will your opportunity for trade.
 

Once your planetary system is conceived, it is under threat from without and within! You are tasked to set up satellites to monitor.
This new satellite system reveals many threats ready to affect your living worlds:
 


Environmental Disaster - Unstable planets quake and volcanoes erupt.

Biodiversity - Darwinistic predators vs. prey reshape life

Pole Reversals - Electro-magnetic poles may reverse suddenly. 

Weather - Massive storms may rage on planets. 

Disease - Unknown viruses may eradicate life. 

Space Objects - Moons or asteroids may collide with planets. 

Orbits - Habitable areas may occur only part time. 

Climate Change - Temperatures may shift widely, changing a planet.


Head to the Flight Deck to build and equip the ship that will propel you through the Galaxy.

Pilot it through friends’ planetary systems, mysterious planets and unknown stars.
Many design options will be available that resemble prototypes of existing craft and others hinting at what might come in the future. You must equip it with the sorts of tools you will need to accomplish challenges.

Construct your spacecraft, equip it with the tools you'll need to accomplish challenges.
The physics and science of space travel will be accurate to what we know and conjecture to be realistic in the near future.

Choose an Astro-Suit that defines you and celebrates your civilization's pioneering culture.

Concept art for the Astro-Explorer spacesuits.
Before you rush out into the unknown, you must equip yourself to sustain the unknown conditions of the galaxy.
As you conquer mission challenges and earn rewards, you'll have the option to put some of it into upgrading your suit or modding it in the lab.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Greetings to all you people who found this campaign page! My name is Andrey Larionov, known as Shooter__Andy on the Internet (some of you may remember me from the GoldSrc modding community, or, more specifically, a rather well-received mod I made called <a href=""http://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-zombie-edition"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Half-Life: Zombie Edition</a>) and this is the project that I've been working on for quite a while now.</p>
<p>Equinox is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tabletop role-playing_game</a> that has, in my opinion, a few points that should be interesting and innovative enough to warrant its existence among all the other systems and settings out there.</p>
<h2>Basic Information</h2>
<p><span>There are several main goals that I'll try to achieve while creating this game, both system mechanics-wise and setting-wise, but before that, here are some general ones.</span></p>
<h3><span>General Points</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Feedback and Updates</strong> <span>–</span> I'd like to develop the game with you, my supporters, as both critics and sources of inspiration. For that purpose, I'll create regular video-logs describing my current progress and, more importantly, why I did what I did and listen to your input.</li>
<li>
<strong>Free to Play</strong> <span>– The handbooks will be absolutely free and they will provide all the necessary information, both from mechanical and setting standpoints. The only content that will be charged for are additional in-depth materials, such as those describing what the residents of the setting (such as player characters and NPCs) wouldn't know and potential bonus additions, expanding the rules, new modules etc. None of them would be in any way, shape or form required to play the game and the mechanical additions would NOT be of the ""pay to win"" sort.</span>
</li>
<li><span><strong>Made for both real world <em>and</em> the Internet </strong>– This is the result of my experience playing both in real world and over the Internet: your computer wouldn't be a barrier that you need to overcome to play, but rather a handy tool that provides you with a simple and convenient way to game, but it's not required either (you can see the System section for a little bit more details on that).</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting</h3>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>The Basics</strong> – A blend of Fantasy and Steampunk set in an analogue of late XIX century;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>The Finer Points</strong> – No gunpowder (and, therefore, guns in the sense that we know them), as a result, some of the knightly traditions survived from the Medieval period, both the technology and magic are integrated in the everyday life, creating a different, and yet so familiar society.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Science and Magic</strong> – A more ""scientific"" look onto the world, even if the science here includes magic and physical deities as a well established fact. Think of Alfred Brehm describing species of dragons, for instance...</span></li>
<li><span><strong>A Serious Take on Steampunk </strong>– it's not so rare to see settings embracing some of the inherent silliness of the Steampunk genre, but this setting will try to operate as if it was an actual world and not just an over-exaggeration of some of the characteristics of a real historical period.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>System</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A Classless and Levelless System</strong> – Somewhat akin to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GURPS</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Darkness"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World of Darkness</a>, this system won't have neither character classes, nor strict leveling system, but rather character points. However, obviously, it will have a few major differences from these systems as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>Modular Complexity</strong> – You can decide on how complex you want your in-game calculations to be (with more complex being more realistic), from simple die rolls to those impossible without a computer. Want to play with just pen, paper and you trusty dicebag? No problem. Want to have a game that actually uses the calculational capacity of your computer? You can do this too!</li>
<li>
<strong>Modular Rules in General!</strong> – Just as well, you can include or exclude a large number of optional rules based on the tone or goals of your campaign. Moreover, you can do this on the fly, changing the rules to be more realistic for one climactic duel while letting the players to cleave through the common enemies without having to bother with the more complex rolls and other factors.</li>
<li><span><strong>No System-Driven Stereotypes</strong> – An attempt to escape the mechanical enforcements of stereotypes leading to, for example, ""all elves use bows or two swords because it doesn't make sense to NOT use them because of their racial bonuses"". The idea? A Background Mechanic. There are general backgrounds, applicable to all or most races and specific backgrounds based less on the race and more on the culture. Each and every one of these are viable and combinable to create a unique character without having to make him or her weaker mechanically.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All of these points will be explained in-depth in the video format if there will be people interested enough in the project.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: large;"">Why indiegogo?</span></h2>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>I personally feel that crowd-funding might possibly be one of the best ideas in quite a few years. It provided great projects that might not exist otherwise and I hope that my project will be one of them. This site gives me the opportunity to see if there are people interested in playing the game I am making and to help me in designing it. I feel like having people interested in what I'm doing is the greatest motivator.</p>
<p>Now, why do I need money at all? It's simple – creating a fair-balanced and well thought out tabletop system requires a lot of time and effort from calculating the statistics to creating a consistent setting. Sadly, I would not be able to dedicate myself enough if I had to spend most of my time earning money somewhere else, since it's very rare when a hobby ""side project"" turns out into something large. But if this could be my job, I promise, I will create a quality product.</p>
<p>All the money I'll receive would be spent on bare necessities: bills, food etc. If I have any money left, I'll try to hire other people to help me, since while I'm ""Jack of all Trades"", I'm, sadly, ""Master of None"" as it goes, and having a dedicated, say, artist on board will greatly improve the quality of the final product.</p>
<h2>Supporter Perks and Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>As I've mentioned, the basic handbooks and all the other necessary products would be absolutely free. However, there will be bonuses nevertheless!</p>
<p>(All of the rewards for the lower tier are included in the reward for the upper tier)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong title="" or $10"">Adventurer ($15 or $10 for the first 20 supporters)</strong> – You will receive a digital copy of the book <em>""Three Sides of Light""</em> describing in-depth details of human society of the world of Equinox, including the most common religion held in the Empire of Eberia.</li>
<li>
<strong title="" or $25"">Hero ($30 or $25 for the first 20 supporters)</strong> – You will receive a digital copy of the book <em>""The Cycle of Nature, the Point of Unnature"" </em>describing the in-depth details many inhabitants of the world of Equinox wouldn't know, including the details about lesser religions, the nature of magic and gods etc.</li>
<li>
<strong title="" or $45"">Legend ($50 or $45 for the first 10 supporters)</strong> – You will receive a digital copy of the book <em>""Beyond the Eye of Darkness"" </em>describing the in-depth details not available to most inhabitants of the world of Equinox, including the details about other political powers, forbidden religions etc.</li>
<li>
<strong title="" or $90"">Demigod ($100 or $90 for the first 10 supporters)</strong> – You will be able to create (or request) a specific character that will be included as a known figure in the world. Also, your name will be placed in the credits and you will always be able to receive the latest updates to test them!</li>
</ul><p>Now, about the stretch goals. As I've said, the first priority would be inviting other people to work on the project. As of yet, I cannot provide better details on the specific stretch goals, but the priority would be adding an artist, a professional writer, a designer and an editor. The next stretch goal would be creating a unified application for playing using the PC, a blend of character generator, roller and a mapping software.

<p> </p></div>","Introduction
Greetings to all you people who found this campaign page! My name is Andrey Larionov, known as Shooter__Andy on the Internet (some of you may remember me from the GoldSrc modding community, or, more specifically, a rather well-received mod I made called Half-Life: Zombie Edition) and this is the project that I've been working on for quite a while now.
Equinox is a tabletop role-playing_game that has, in my opinion, a few points that should be interesting and innovative enough to warrant its existence among all the other systems and settings out there.
Basic Information
There are several main goals that I'll try to achieve while creating this game, both system mechanics-wise and setting-wise, but before that, here are some general ones.
General Points


Feedback and Updates – I'd like to develop the game with you, my supporters, as both critics and sources of inspiration. For that purpose, I'll create regular video-logs describing my current progress and, more importantly, why I did what I did and listen to your input.

Free to Play – The handbooks will be absolutely free and they will provide all the necessary information, both from mechanical and setting standpoints. The only content that will be charged for are additional in-depth materials, such as those describing what the residents of the setting (such as player characters and NPCs) wouldn't know and potential bonus additions, expanding the rules, new modules etc. None of them would be in any way, shape or form required to play the game and the mechanical additions would NOT be of the ""pay to win"" sort.

Made for both real world and the Internet – This is the result of my experience playing both in real world and over the Internet: your computer wouldn't be a barrier that you need to overcome to play, but rather a handy tool that provides you with a simple and convenient way to game, but it's not required either (you can see the System section for a little bit more details on that).

Setting

The Basics – A blend of Fantasy and Steampunk set in an analogue of late XIX century;
The Finer Points – No gunpowder (and, therefore, guns in the sense that we know them), as a result, some of the knightly traditions survived from the Medieval period, both the technology and magic are integrated in the everyday life, creating a different, and yet so familiar society.
Science and Magic – A more ""scientific"" look onto the world, even if the science here includes magic and physical deities as a well established fact. Think of Alfred Brehm describing species of dragons, for instance...
A Serious Take on Steampunk – it's not so rare to see settings embracing some of the inherent silliness of the Steampunk genre, but this setting will try to operate as if it was an actual world and not just an over-exaggeration of some of the characteristics of a real historical period.

System


A Classless and Levelless System – Somewhat akin to GURPS or World of Darkness, this system won't have neither character classes, nor strict leveling system, but rather character points. However, obviously, it will have a few major differences from these systems as well.

Modular Complexity – You can decide on how complex you want your in-game calculations to be (with more complex being more realistic), from simple die rolls to those impossible without a computer. Want to play with just pen, paper and you trusty dicebag? No problem. Want to have a game that actually uses the calculational capacity of your computer? You can do this too!

Modular Rules in General! – Just as well, you can include or exclude a large number of optional rules based on the tone or goals of your campaign. Moreover, you can do this on the fly, changing the rules to be more realistic for one climactic duel while letting the players to cleave through the common enemies without having to bother with the more complex rolls and other factors.
No System-Driven Stereotypes – An attempt to escape the mechanical enforcements of stereotypes leading to, for example, ""all elves use bows or two swords because it doesn't make sense to NOT use them because of their racial bonuses"". The idea? A Background Mechanic. There are general backgrounds, applicable to all or most races and specific backgrounds based less on the race and more on the culture. Each and every one of these are viable and combinable to create a unique character without having to make him or her weaker mechanically.

All of these points will be explained in-depth in the video format if there will be people interested enough in the project.
Why indiegogo?

 
I personally feel that crowd-funding might possibly be one of the best ideas in quite a few years. It provided great projects that might not exist otherwise and I hope that my project will be one of them. This site gives me the opportunity to see if there are people interested in playing the game I am making and to help me in designing it. I feel like having people interested in what I'm doing is the greatest motivator.
Now, why do I need money at all? It's simple – creating a fair-balanced and well thought out tabletop system requires a lot of time and effort from calculating the statistics to creating a consistent setting. Sadly, I would not be able to dedicate myself enough if I had to spend most of my time earning money somewhere else, since it's very rare when a hobby ""side project"" turns out into something large. But if this could be my job, I promise, I will create a quality product.
All the money I'll receive would be spent on bare necessities: bills, food etc. If I have any money left, I'll try to hire other people to help me, since while I'm ""Jack of all Trades"", I'm, sadly, ""Master of None"" as it goes, and having a dedicated, say, artist on board will greatly improve the quality of the final product.
Supporter Perks and Stretch Goals
As I've mentioned, the basic handbooks and all the other necessary products would be absolutely free. However, there will be bonuses nevertheless!
(All of the rewards for the lower tier are included in the reward for the upper tier)


Adventurer ($15 or $10 for the first 20 supporters) – You will receive a digital copy of the book ""Three Sides of Light"" describing in-depth details of human society of the world of Equinox, including the most common religion held in the Empire of Eberia.

Hero ($30 or $25 for the first 20 supporters) – You will receive a digital copy of the book ""The Cycle of Nature, the Point of Unnature"" describing the in-depth details many inhabitants of the world of Equinox wouldn't know, including the details about lesser religions, the nature of magic and gods etc.

Legend ($50 or $45 for the first 10 supporters) – You will receive a digital copy of the book ""Beyond the Eye of Darkness"" describing the in-depth details not available to most inhabitants of the world of Equinox, including the details about other political powers, forbidden religions etc.

Demigod ($100 or $90 for the first 10 supporters) – You will be able to create (or request) a specific character that will be included as a known figure in the world. Also, your name will be placed in the credits and you will always be able to receive the latest updates to test them!
Now, about the stretch goals. As I've said, the first priority would be inviting other people to work on the project. As of yet, I cannot provide better details on the specific stretch goals, but the priority would be adding an artist, a professional writer, a designer and an editor. The next stretch goal would be creating a unified application for playing using the PC, a blend of character generator, roller and a mapping software. After that, very stretch goal would include writing a new piece of either mechanical modules or setting details.
How Can You Support And Why You Should
Not everybody can support this campaign financially or feel confident enough that their money will be put to good use, that is understandable. But even so, you can still help the project!

The Tsi-hu, shapeshifting alien enemies of Ember, shown here in both their humanoid and kaiju forms.

Ember is a planetary scale shooter, a wargame, where players must wage a combined arms war against an alien NPC enemy, called the Tsi-hu, to win control of the planet designated EM-8ER.The aliens fight with their shape-shifting abilities where they can switch between their humanoid form and their beast (or kaiju) form. Players wear fast moving, powered armor called Omniframes, which they customize and outfit with weapons and upgrades they craft from the resources they mine from the planet itself.

A player piloting his Omniframe, a jump-jet equipped, gliding capable suit of powered armor whose capabilities can be fully customized by the player from heavy assault to stealth.

The battles take place over the surface of the planet, in pockets of habitable space that have been claimed and terraformed by the players over the course of several months and years as mini expansions are released for the game. More and more of the planet, its secrets, and new enemies are revealed over time in an episodic fashion.Mining planetary resources is critical to player efforts, as everything in the game must be crafted by players. Collecting rare resources to unlock new weapon and Omniframe capabilities is a key aspect of the game.

Mining is carried out by giant drill-wielding MEK-A (Mechanically Enhanced Kinetics - Autonomous) robots, which players must defend and escort back to player built bases.

<li>
<strong>Character Customization! </strong>Character customization in Arakion is a refreshing take on the RPG Level-Up formula.

From the weapons you choose to forge, to the add-ons you choose for their housing, every decision has an impact on your heroes.</li>
<li>
<strong>You did what with my weapon?! </strong>Each character only starts with one weapon, one set of armor and four skills.

Every decision you make has a permanent and lasting impact on your hero which resonates in the manner they play and interact with the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>Town Building! </strong>Using building blueprints you find, the people you rescue, along with the help of a mysterious stranger, you'll use ancient devices to rebuild a lost town. You'll have to choose wisely however, as some building decisions permanently prevent other choices.</li>
<li>
<strong>Combat! </strong> Combat in Arakion allows you to choose real-time, turn-based or a unique blend of both. The core system of Arakion takes two old school styles of gameplay and merging them into one seamless combat experience. </li>
<li>
<strong>Adventure! </strong>You'll adventure through dozens of dungeons, castles and open world areas while finding hidden passageways, collecting materials and crushing your foes.</li>

<strong>Expanding : </strong>Take a look at the stretch chart. I've spent a lot of time crunching the numbers so you know exactly what you're getting for your buck.</li>

I'll be using Indiegogo to add even more additional content into the game. The content includes anything from characters to bosses, specifically the funding will be used for:


Hiring : A game is not easy to make, so I'll be using Indiegogo funds to hire on the extra hands I need to make Arakion a reality.

Surviving : Paying the bills - you know how it goes.

Expanding : Take a look at the stretch chart. I've spent a lot of time crunching the numbers so you know exactly what you're getting for your buck.

Software...ing : The license to use software can be extremely expensive, and while I own most of the software needed to make the game, buying the additional pieces that put that extra layer of polish on it can be very pricey

We created the ultimate fast paced shoot em up action frame and filled it with all the game elements we love in beautiful hand-drawn 2d worlds. There are upgradeable drone pets, a RPG like damage system and player damage model. Three different pilots with active skills and character progression, random content generator, 3 different ingame shops, plenty of permanent upgrades and Stage Power Ups. Fifteen upgradeable weapons, 3 upgradeable wing fighters, 50+ enemy types, 10+ ship-levels,  a combo system, classic score ranking and a lot more. You'll fight on 8 Planets in 32 Story Missions and unlimited random stages. Sky Mercenaries combines classic arcade gameplay with tons of new game elements and the palyer is absolutely free to create his own combination. Sky Mercenaries is the best and most advanced game we ever created.</span><br/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our main goal was to integrate a sci-fi
art style with a ""hand-made"" touch.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Of course, there is diversication
needed, so basically we aimed to create symmetrical ships with
straight lines and some contraries with curved lines.</p>
<p>With this main concept in mind we
created a dozen of thumbnails and even some ships in 3D to find out
what works well.</p>
<p>The first thing we noticed, the most
awesome sci-fi ship concept in the net were useless for us, because
the top orthographic perspective has its own unique points of
interest in design terms.</p>

<div><i><b>Let's take a closer look at the ""pimped"" shoot em up elements first.</b></i></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>The color system</b></div>
<div>One of the basic elements in Sky Mercenaries ist the color system. There are 2 main firemodes for each fighter, red and blue. The player is free to change the firemode at any time in the game. Each bullet and enemy has a color too. If a blue enemy bullet hits you, while you're in red firemode, a part of your fighter takes damage. If the bullet and your fighter have the same color, in this example red, you absorb the bullet and charge your overload ability. Once the overload bar is full, your ship sends out an explosive wave, destroying bullets and damages enemies near you.</div>
<div>If you hit your enemies, it's almost the same. If you hit a blue enemy while in blue firemode, he can absorb up to the half of the inflicted damage. Some enemies even more. If you hit the blue enemy with a red bullet, you inflict more damage and gain increased critical hit ratings.<br/>
</div>
<div><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1011159/files/20141113050743-Promo_ColorModel.png?1415884063"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>Sounds simple so far.. Now imagine, 50 enemy types that react to your color and movement. Some tank fighters, change color if you do. Some others generate a shield absorbing one color. There are lasers and rapid fire enemies, that allow and sometimes even require you to change to the weapons color to survive. We played arround with this idea in many parts and details of the game and there is always more than one way to survive a situation. The player has to estimate the danger level at any time and has to decide between more damage and survival every second. This adds a lot of speed to the variety of gameplay elements.</div>

</div></div>","After 1 year of intense development, Sky Mercenaries is exactly what we tried to achieve and ready for the last steps! We created the ultimate fast paced shoot em up action frame and filled it with all the game elements we love in beautiful hand-drawn 2d worlds. There are upgradeable drone pets, a RPG like damage system and player damage model. Three different pilots with active skills and character progression, random content generator, 3 different ingame shops, plenty of permanent upgrades and Stage Power Ups. Fifteen upgradeable weapons, 3 upgradeable wing fighters, 50+ enemy types, 10+ ship-levels,  a combo system, classic score ranking and a lot more. You'll fight on 8 Planets in 32 Story Missions and unlimited random stages. Sky Mercenaries combines classic arcade gameplay with tons of new game elements and the palyer is absolutely free to create his own combination. Sky Mercenaries is the best and most advanced game we ever created.




      
State of Development
The game is ready for beta testing and will be released as soon its perfectly balanced. We are still working on a local co-op mode for the release version and hope to find a way through crowd funding to reinforce our team and enhance the multiplayer part of the game to its full potential.



Be a founder of Sky Mercenaries!
If you support us, it will help Sky Mercenaries in the final steps before release. It helps us developers and designers to continue our fulltime work on this project and gives us the possibility to reinforce our team and buy the necessary hard / software to guarantee a unique multiplayer experience.

Concept & Design
Our main goal was to integrate a sci-fi
art style with a ""hand-made"" touch.


Of course, there is diversication
needed, so basically we aimed to create symmetrical ships with
straight lines and some contraries with curved lines.
With this main concept in mind we
created a dozen of thumbnails and even some ships in 3D to find out
what works well.
The first thing we noticed, the most
awesome sci-fi ship concept in the net were useless for us, because
the top orthographic perspective has its own unique points of
interest in design terms.








Let's take a closer look at the ""pimped"" shoot em up elements first.

The color system
One of the basic elements in Sky Mercenaries ist the color system. There are 2 main firemodes for each fighter, red and blue. The player is free to change the firemode at any time in the game. Each bullet and enemy has a color too. If a blue enemy bullet hits you, while you're in red firemode, a part of your fighter takes damage. If the bullet and your fighter have the same color, in this example red, you absorb the bullet and charge your overload ability. Once the overload bar is full, your ship sends out an explosive wave, destroying bullets and damages enemies near you.
If you hit your enemies, it's almost the same. If you hit a blue enemy while in blue firemode, he can absorb up to the half of the inflicted damage. Some enemies even more. If you hit the blue enemy with a red bullet, you inflict more damage and gain increased critical hit ratings.


Sounds simple so far.. Now imagine, 50 enemy types that react to your color and movement. Some tank fighters, change color if you do. Some others generate a shield absorbing one color. There are lasers and rapid fire enemies, that allow and sometimes even require you to change to the weapons color to survive. We played arround with this idea in many parts and details of the game and there is always more than one way to survive a situation. The player has to estimate the danger level at any time and has to decide between more damage and survival every second. This adds a lot of speed to the variety of gameplay elements.
The Damage System



If a Bullet hits a Target, there are different factors to consider:
- Base Damage (Minimum Damage - Maximum Damage)- Hull Armor & Armor piercing (% percentage)- Critical Hit Rating / Damage (% percentage)- Bullet Type (Energy, Explosive / Red, Blue) (x multiplier)
Each factor depends on Pilot Level, Skills, Ship Level, Upgrades and Drones. 


A new and unique Element in Sky Mercenaries is the Player Damage Model. Each Player Fighter has Parts that can be hit and destroyed by enemy fire. Each part has it's own health display in the upper left of the game interface.

If a part gets damaged, it turns red in the interface and starts to burn.
Drones change formations as you change firemodes and absorb different amounts of damage until they get destroyed.

If a main part of the fighter gets too much damage, the fighter goes down. Fighter parts and Drones can be repaired with repair Power Ups. The player can keep gained experience and cash to Power Up for better chances within the next try.

Combo System
Increase the combo level before the timer ends and evade enemy fire to finish full stages in one-combo to climb the online leaderboards. Unlock bonus stages to reach ultimate Combo levels and compete online.


      

The Sky Mercenaries Universe


Fight over 50 enemy types on 8 worlds in over 32 story missions and unlimited random content. To be prepared for the overpowering enemy fleet, upgrades are an important part in Sky Mercenaries. Upgrade and skill fighters, drones and pilots the way you like to play them. Get powerful and permanent, visible upgrades, armor and different types of weapons. Level up your pilots and assign skill points in 3  different skill trees to unlock a variety of abilities like auto-shield, critical buffs and more.
 


There are even more upgrades in Sky Mercenaries: ""Stage Power Up's""While most hangar parts are permanent upgrades that will be automaticly saved, power ups only work for the current stage. There are 5  power up categories, each upgradeable to level 10 with visible effects. Some of them have permanent passive effects.

      
The single player content in Sky Mercenaries is finished and will be released as soon its perfectly balanced. We are working on multiplayer functions for local and online co-op modes. If you support this project as founder, you help us to realize all the great multiplayer ideas for Sky Mercenaries.

<h2>Who am I? Why am I here? </h2>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Joe Martini, I am 33 years old and games, competitive games, are my passion. That being said, I also hold a master's degree and spent several years as a financial analyst for a Fortune 100 company before being laid off in the Fall of 2010. When confronted with the proverbial crossroads I had several hard decisions to make, but one answer came easily: it was time to attempt a living in something I love. As I stated previously, I love games. </p>
<p>This brings me to the reason we are here today, Fantasy Gaming League. FGL is my baby, from start to finish, excluding some exceedingly fantastic artwork (which I am incapable of), I have designed, coded, and constructed the databases for fglgamingleague.com on my own. I also plan to market, obtain sponsors, compute and maintain the scoring and just whatever else the site needs on my own too. The website you're on currently is called Indiegogo, and if there is anything that Fantasy Gaming League is, it's indie. </p>
<p>Oh, and remember how I said I did all the designing, coding, database building on my own? Well when I first started working on the site I didn't have even a rudimentary knowledge of html, let alone php, ajax, sql, java etc. All of which played a huge part in getting the site developed. </p>
<p>So, here I am, on the precipice of getting this site launched. Presenting the gaming community with something they have never had before. Fantasy Gamig League promises to provide fans of e-sports and competitive gaming a whole new level of excitement when it comes to following tournaments and their favorite players. Site members will draft their teams in a fantasy sports style and earn points based on how their team members finish. Members will compete for prizes ranging from gaming peripherals, to dream trips to tournaments around the world. With support for Starcraft II, Fighting Games, MOBAs and Shooters, FGL will have something for every fan. </p>

<p>Tools - As I approach the last few weeks of development, upgrading my system or at least some components of my pc will be essential to getting through. I will share pictures of everything that your generosity helps to purchase.</p>
<p>Art - Guys, I can't draw stick figures. No really, I can't. Luckily I have had the pleasure of having the gaming community's best cartoonist Miss Kat Smith, aka TurboToaster (you know, the person responsible for the awesome cartoon versions of the GiantBomb.com guys) draw our site's awesome mascot Oddbjorn Viking and needless to say I want her to do all of the art for the site. You don't expect her to toil away for a pat on the back do you?!</p>
<p>Prizes - The coolest thing about FGL will be the opportunity to win prizes. From mice, headsets, keyboards, fight sticks, to prize packages and tournament trips (I really wanna make this happen). </p>
<p>Misc - Maintaining a website costs money, and I could use some help starting out for hosting fees, security features, etc. If the campaign goes well, I would love to enlist the help of others to make the site as great as it could be, whether compiling statistics, marketing, or building a better site. </p>

<p>Welcome to a campaign that's probably a little different from anything you've seen before. Unlike most game-related crowdfunding campaigns — which, you know, fund games — we're a little different. We're building a website for those games. Oh, and all the other games in the world too. No joke! </p>
<p>Archive aims to be the ultimate gaming website. But what does that even mean? It’s a website that has everything anyone could ever ask for regarding information about video games! That means a constant flow of unique editorial content (with original written and video features!), a huge database of video game information and media (the biggest in the world, actually!), a robust API, an awesome community and loads more. These four primary features are what define Archive, and what makes it an amazing resource for gamers everywhere. Our unconventional take on creating a gaming website sets us apart from the gaming websites of today. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/3294/3bq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This whole package is in one of the sleekest websites around. We understand that this is quite the undertaking, but we’ve got an incredible team that’s ready for the challenge.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p><br/> We've been getting a lot of questions about Archive's current and future plans. This section should help everyone understand Archive on a deeper level, as it's important to us that you all know where we're heading.<br/><br/><strong>Our Current Database (Present)</strong><br/><br/> Aside from our current beta website (wherein only a portion of our information and metadata is displayed), we currently have a database full of technical game information. This information is all academic, and was gathered from press releases and other materials given out publicly by the developers/publishers themselves at one point or another.<br/><br/> This includes first-party sources such as Nintendo and Sony as well as other confirmed reliable sources such as TOSEC, Goodsets, Mobygames, GameFAQs and other widely used public databases. What our database currently covers:<br/><br/>    * 102,459 game entries across 139 systems<br/>    * Basic descriptions or back-of-the-box game overviews<br/>    * Multiplayer support<br/>    * Screenshots and a small number of wallpapers, partially sorted into categories<br/>    * Box/cover art<br/>    * Developers, publishers, titles, and any other basic information you would expect from a game database (like genre, release dates, and so on)<br/>    * ROM identifiers/CSCs<br/>    * Nearly 1.8 million credits and contributors listings (just names and roles at this stage)<br/><br/> By combining and crosschecking this information alone, we have already cataloged more games than any video game database to date. Our information is organized so it will be quick and easily searchable. We have not taken work from users' FAQs, reviews, or articles, and we will not take game manual scans from other databases unless granted express permission to do so.<br/><br/> Users of our API are able to draw on all of this information for their apps. All uploaded images are automatically resized to meet a range of common size requirements. We are already tightly-integrated with OpenEmu and several other apps and media center frontends.<br/><br/> We also have a blog with 90 articles and videos covering a wealth of topics related primarily to the history and culture of games, often in an in-depth journalistic fashion. Blog posts link to relevant game pages and draw wallpaper from these wherever possible. The blog is not searchable (except via a search engine like Google), but we do have a popular and similar articles sidebar.<br/><br/> We use Joomla as our backend core, which has proved problematic in both maintaining and updating the code for everything (not to mention managing traffic spikes). This will change to a custom system built from scratch for Archive 2.0.<br/><br/><strong>2.0 Beta Launch (Near Future)</strong><br/><br/> Our 2.0 launch will begin with us displaying all of this data on our stunning new design and architecture. Every game page will feel like a home to its displayed game. Fast speed, in-depth search features, obsessive organization, and a very easy user experience will be our focal points — besides getting the data as accurate as possible, of course.<br/><br/> We will allow users to embed videos (YouTube), to provide more information, and to rate the content hosted on our database. This stage will be our private 2.0 beta, which will allow users to browse our massive database and preview the tools we're giving users to add to our database — and generally to test everything so that it's all working as intended before the public rollout.<br/><br/> It will be simplistic, but deep, with a wealth of factual video game information beyond what anyone has ever seen (or at least we think so).<br/><br/> On the blog front, we'll spend this time testing new systems that allow greater flexibility in layout and leave room for totally-custom CSS as well as integration with the search feature. We'll be focusing on the database and the new website at this point, however, with articles ramping up again after public launch.<br/><br/> For community and user profiles, we have yet to finalize the details, but you can expect something along the lines of the following either during the private beta or sometime soon after public launch:<br/><br/>    * A simple profile page (much like the one registered users already have)<br/>    * Messages<br/>    * Friends<br/>    * Games lists and collections (app users already have a library collection feature available)<br/><br/> We'll be listening to our beta users and will take all suggestions seriously. We of course have our own ideas for unique features, but this will pave the way for the features seen on our public launch.<br/><br/><strong>2.0 Public Launch (Future)</strong><br/><br/> At this point our database will not only be the largest factual, searchable database, but we will begin to make room for more in-depth content. We have big plans for the future of Archive, and will not only have support for content such as user reviews, manuals, history trees, guides, and much more, but will drive and reward our community for contributing to us.<br/><br/> We are making an effort to give our users credit and proper spotlighting for their contributions. A website like this is nothing without its users and community, so your importance will not be overlooked. Archive will change and grow the way its users demand, unlike any other database around.<br/><br/> On the blog, you can expect From The Archive (narrative playthroughs of random games) to return, along with a new game diary and hopefully lots of videos and reported features, while we'll also be heavily pushing community interaction on the forums.<br/><br/> Elsewhere, we'd like to introduce a consoles/systems section, which would have overview text, in-depth histories, images, videos, and various relevant factual metadata. That is likely several months or more away, however, depending on your feedback.<br/><br/> Ultimately, our database will be something that is vastly different from anything gamers have seen. Its vast amount of information, agile structure, and unique features will set us apart and make us a valuable resource to gamers everywhere.<br/><br/> We realize that it's incredibly ambitious, but that's why we're taking it on in incremental steps. This is just a small vertical slice of our full roadmap, which goes into excruciating detail on what each feature is and how it will (or rather could) be implemented.</p>

<p>We sometimes call Archive the IMDb of video games, but as you'll see what we're planning is much more than that. When Archive was originally conceived back in 2010, the goal was to be the largest searchable, factual video game database on the internet. But our ambitions grew as we realized how much potential there is in Archive's database being just one element of a grander project.</p>
<p>Our proof-of-concept website.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/1476/3kxs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We want to develop a community, become a unique source of news and information that stands apart from the games media echo chamber, and support developers and researchers by providing an easy to use feature-rich tiered API system.  </p>
<h3>The Database</h3>
<p>One of our primary goals is preserving as much data about video games as possible. Video games are much more than ""games"" to us; they're history, and should be treated as such. Archive already has more games cataloged than any games website to date. You can check out our beta website at <a href=""http://www.archive.vg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Archive.vg</span></a> , but keep in mind that this is just a proof of concept and some things are broken. Behind the curtains we’ve got a ton of data for these 100,000+ games that’s not currently displayed. But we plan to show it all in Archive 2.0! Every game page will be populated with a plethora of information, carefully presented and laid out so as to not be overwhelming or confusing.</p>
<p>As you would expect, every game will have things such as screenshots, platforms, genres, release date, ESRB, developers, and all that other good stuff. Expect to see much more than this, though!</p>
<p>Every game will have its own videos tab, wallpapers, accurate multiplayer support information, community discussions, featured articles of interest from various sources, related games, box art, manuals, and much much more. And it's all searchable too! Plus we'll put together independent pages for video game consoles and computers. We’re presenting all of this information with one of the most incredibly simple and sleek-looking infrastructures around.</p>
<p>The Archive 2.0 database will be jaw-droppingly huge! All users will be able to make their own additions as well, to ensure we have the maximum amount of information for every game. And we don’t discriminate! This is for all games, from the oldest, most obscure retro (hello <a href=""http://archive.vg/game/18356/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Elevator Fight</span></a> for the Super Cassette Vision) all the way to PS4 and beyond. No watermarks, no limitations. Our collection of information is for everyone, and we want you to use it!</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img577/5274/87942519.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Where is this huge database from? Is it stolen *Gasp!*</strong></p>
<p>Haha, no! Not at all. Anything Archive uses is based on datasets from a lot of people who have contributed to our project. These datasets include Fair Use information from sites like GameFAQs, MobyGames,  etc... We only use information which is Fair Use, and this includes many smaller public domain / user with permission data sets like TOSEC, GoodSets, etc. Information that we won’t be using are things like Descriptions or Overviews from other databases. Content written by their respective community are copyrighted to said websites, so they WILL NOT be used! We have also received significant contributions from sites that specialize in information about a single platform. Our website is designed to strongly encourage any user who wants to contribute to add to our website!</p>
<p>Any content added on our website will be credited to the original producers/creators of said content. We want our users to upload anything they've made that they want to share with us. We are doing our best to make sure everyone is given proper recognition. We’re all about the sharing of information on Archive.</p>
<p>We believe in complete transparency here, and we are in no way looking to profit off other people’s hard work! We know that you’ve worked hard to collect information, and proper recognition will be given out to anything we use! Neither our current 1.0 design nor our 2.0 future designs have a place for any kind of advertising.</p>
<p><strong>We are not</strong> using any information that is not granted for public use, or that we have not been given direct permission to use. We love websites that collect information on a smaller, more focused scale and we have no plans, nor will we ever, to take anyone's hard work!</p>
<p>Content that we deem under fair use is only material that was intended for public use. All other game information that that is in our database is willingly given by users or other websites that have granted permission for public use in databases like ours. We aren't taking anyone's reviews or videos or FAQs or anything that they own, or have worked hard to create for a specific website. We have left it up to our users to upload any of the content they have made to add it to the website. We have already been around for a little while now (1.0 beta launched a year ago), and we have been building a community that has been happy to help us build and add information to our database that they have produced themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will Archive be different from other databases?</strong></p>
<p>Content-wise, what we provide of each specific game goes beyond what any other database has to offer — with several unique features. Every game has systems in place (and lots of stuff already collected!) for videos (mostly embedded from sites like YouTube), manuals, full boxart, labels, screenshots and much more — all unwatermarked! I could make a very long list about the exact content our database has, and what we can possibly display on each game page, but this is largely dependent on what people want displayed and expect from Archive.</p>
<p>In terms of design and user interface, we’re looking pretty good as well! All of our features and designs are being created from the ground up just for Archive, with a lot HTML5 and other technical stuff to ensure we’re the fastest and coolest-looking cats around.</p>
<p>On the semi-technical side our advanced search features really help set us apart as well. We allow for an incredible level of depth for finding games. You’ll be able to search across every content field independently or in combinations. Also don’t forget about our API! We want other people to use our database as well, with our API built to support other developers and their projects.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Editorial</h3>
<p>We're not just about having a kick-ass database. We want to inform and entertain gamers of all stripes and colors, and for that we'll have a constant flow of original written and video content. Although we'll have reviews and some of the normal ""expected"" content for a video game website, we won't become JustAnotherGamesSite.com!</p>
<p>We want to write about topics that nobody knew they wanted to know about. We want to be creative with our topics and write about the old and the new! There are so many aspects of the video game world that are overlooked because they don't fit the narrow scope of existing editorial sites. We want our users to be informed about much more than who is winning the console war and the latest leveling tactics in Call of Duty. We will talk about old games in the context of new ones and discuss new titles in the context of old, and we'll always show some love to lesser-known releases.</p>
<p>Our articles and videos trace the history and culture of video games — not in some stuffy academic voice but in a way that takes you on a journey of discovery. We won't talk down to you, but nor will we expect you to know everything. We'll try to make you laugh, make you smile, and make you smarter and better informed about our shared passion. And we hope you will push us to go deeper and further in every direction.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img833/4381/31355858.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>The Community</h3>
<p>We want to develop a community at Archive like no other. We want to appeal to all gamers out there. We're looking to have highly detailed, customizable user pages. Users will be able to share what they're currently playing as well as let other gamers know the games and systems they love. Looking for some buddies to jump on Dark Souls with? Got it. Looking for someone to help you get in some training in Street Fighter VI? Got it.</p>
<p>We want to bring everyone together with our custom-built social features so gamers can truly unite. We'll be rewarding all our users for taking part in Archive as well. Adding to our database, taking part in discussion, and having an awesome user page will grab you some awesome perks within the website...but we can't give away too much info on this now!</p>
<h3><strong>The API </strong></h3>
<p><span>Archive's new API will allow an unprecedented level of direct access to the Archive database of over 100,000 games. Whether you're developing an emulator for retro classics (like, say, <a href=""http://openemu.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OpenEmu</a>, which uses our database to grab cover art and a few other tidbits), a personal organizer for your collection of next-gen games, or even just want to figure out some crazy stats; our API delivers a lot of information and media in a super easy-to-use package. We plan on developing a free tier which will blow even the paid tiers of our competition away, and hopefully in the near future our own paid tier which will give virtually unlimited access to our database. Developers get ready!</span></p>
<h2>What else does Archive have to offer me?</h2>
<h3><strong>The Application</strong></h3>
<p>The power of Archive in your pocket. Just like our website, we also have an early proof-of-concept mobile app available at <a href=""http://archive.vg/mobile"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">http://archive.vg/mobile</span></a> This will provide all of the features of Archive on the go. Although our current Beta release only supports iPhone, well be updating it for 2.0 to include an Android version and tablet support.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4082/gfeo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>The Growth</h3>
<p>Archive will grow, but how it will grow is up to you. We want to create the ultimate gaming website here so your opinions are invaluable. Our own roadmap has plenty of wiggle room on the direction of the website. Archive will be community-driven. A website for gamers built by gamers. No hidden agenda. We believe in complete transparency and we will constantly keep everyone up to date on where Archive is going and how we plan to get there.</p>
<h3><strong>The Launch</strong></h3>
<p>Deadlines are always difficult. We want to get Archive out as soon as possible so everyone can enjoy our features but we want to make sure that everything is in tip-top shape for our audience. We're shooting for our private beta launch to be somewhere between late 2013 and early 2014. Backers will be constantly updated on the status of Archive and when we have a solid date for our beta and public launches they will be the first to know. </p>
<h3><strong>Why 2.0? Why not 1.0 or 1.1?</strong></h3>
<p>Archive's beta launch was based on our 1.0 design. Originally we planned to build upon this in small increments to achieve our goals, but as time went on our goals simply changed and we quickly learned the limitations of our current systems. We've learned a lot from our 1.0 launch. We went through a couple of different hosts, tried using Joomla! for our content management systems — with tweaks of our own — but in the end we learned that in order to create the best website possible we have to build Archive from the ground up.</p>
<p>Archive 2.0 is completely built off our own custom framework now and it’s super fast, and super accessible. Making something like this takes a lot of time and effort, but, realistically, if we want to create this ultimate resource, it needs to be done.</p>

<p>Despite us all being internet superheroes, we live very normal lives in the downtime. Most of us have full-time jobs, and Archive is a hobby project solely driven by our passion to create something amazing for gamers everywhere. We currently don't monetize Archive at all because we want to nail the quality and experience without shoving awful ads in your face, and we're far from ready to earn money through things like subscriptions or other alternative income streams.</p>
<p>But it's difficult to making something groundbreaking without a little help. That's why we're turning to Indiegogo.</p>
<p>All of your donations (minus the fees) will go right back into Archive. We love our small team, but we want our family to grow so we can constantly be on the cutting edge. We need money not only to support the current team but also to get some additional man (or woman-)power in place to push us into the stratosphere. </p>
<p>Your donations will help us free up more time to work and to purchase new equipment. This means things such as recording equipment and new and more powerful computers.</p>
<p>Did I mention marketing? We want to make a dent, and not just a little one — we're talking a huge one! But getting a name out there is difficult with so many established players in the space. We'll spend a small slice of your donations on an awareness campaign that tells the world what we're doing and why Archive will leave websites like MobyGames and GameFAQs in the dust.</p>
<h3>Here's a breakdown of Archive's finances, and what we'll be doing with all our donations.</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/558/gt7m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, Developers, Developers! We could use some extra hands on board. More often than not, recruiting help costs money. Whether it be someone to help us on our blog or to tune things under the hood, any new recruits will help speed up development time as well as help moving Archive forward from our 2.0 launch. We'll be putting <strong>$7,000 </strong>toward finding new help, and we'll add to this figure if we exceed our goal.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">Pay ourselves! We all want to dedicate more time to Archive than we currently do, but that would mean taking time off of work. Archive will be crunching for the next couple months, and to make sure our launch goes as smoothly and quickly as possible some of us will need to solely dedicate our time to the project. We'll be putting <strong>$6,000</strong> into ensuring 100% Archive manpower!</li>
</ul><ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">In order to keep up our team will need new equipment. Our video editor works from a desktop, but he'd really like to replace it with a new laptop because he's not as stationary as he used to be. With this he'll also need some HDMI recording devices and a camcorder for producing other video content for everyone to enjoy. This totals up to be around <strong>$2,000.</strong>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Getting our name out there! Since we want everyone to know about us, we will need to advertise. A couple months of solid advertising we not only help build our community, but will also help us build our website. <strong>$1,000!</strong>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>We want to give back to our supporters! This one is up in the air since it's hard to see into the future, but we expect to spend around <strong>$6,000~</strong>$<strong>8,000</strong> on fulfilling our contributors' rewards. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Indiegogo and transaction fees of around <strong>$2,000</strong>. This is 4% if we're fully funded and 9% if not, plus 3% on each transaction paid via credit card. After this we're pretty much all out of money!</li>
</ul><h3><strong>And what if we exceed our goals?</strong></h3>
<p>Server costs are around <strong>$600</strong> a month, going up depending on the traffic. Last month we hit around <strong>$800</strong> and we can only see this number increasing in the future. Around 40% of all donations above our original goals will contribute directly to hosting costs, so if we double our goals this would be approximately <strong>$10,000.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More Developers! Our family will extend even more and Archive’s 2.0 developments will be faster than the speed of light. We'll be putting about 25% of all the money beyond our initial goals to getting us all the help we can get. If we double our goals the total amount of money going toward this would be around <strong>$13,000</strong>.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>We want our name to get out there, so we’ll be putting around 10% of any money over our goals to even more advertising. This number would be around <strong>$3,500 </strong>if we double our goal!</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The rest of the money will be put into fulfilling awards and Indiegogo fees, so around 25% of any more over our goals will be put towards this cause. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> We selected flexible funding because every dollar counts, and even money raised below the goal will help us push Archive onward and upward.</p>
<p>We currently pay everything out of our own pockets, so hopefully this will give you an idea of where your money will be going if you choose to take part in our project. We hope to see you all soon at our 2.0 launch!</p>
<p><strong>-The Video Game Archive</strong></p></div>","Welcome to a campaign that's probably a little different from anything you've seen before. Unlike most game-related crowdfunding campaigns — which, you know, fund games — we're a little different. We're building a website for those games. Oh, and all the other games in the world too. No joke! 
Archive aims to be the ultimate gaming website. But what does that even mean? It’s a website that has everything anyone could ever ask for regarding information about video games! That means a constant flow of unique editorial content (with original written and video features!), a huge database of video game information and media (the biggest in the world, actually!), a robust API, an awesome community and loads more. These four primary features are what define Archive, and what makes it an amazing resource for gamers everywhere. Our unconventional take on creating a gaming website sets us apart from the gaming websites of today. 

This whole package is in one of the sleekest websites around. We understand that this is quite the undertaking, but we’ve got an incredible team that’s ready for the challenge.
 
Roadmap
 We've been getting a lot of questions about Archive's current and future plans. This section should help everyone understand Archive on a deeper level, as it's important to us that you all know where we're heading.Our Current Database (Present) Aside from our current beta website (wherein only a portion of our information and metadata is displayed), we currently have a database full of technical game information. This information is all academic, and was gathered from press releases and other materials given out publicly by the developers/publishers themselves at one point or another. This includes first-party sources such as Nintendo and Sony as well as other confirmed reliable sources such as TOSEC, Goodsets, Mobygames, GameFAQs and other widely used public databases. What our database currently covers:    * 102,459 game entries across 139 systems    * Basic descriptions or back-of-the-box game overviews    * Multiplayer support    * Screenshots and a small number of wallpapers, partially sorted into categories    * Box/cover art    * Developers, publishers, titles, and any other basic information you would expect from a game database (like genre, release dates, and so on)    * ROM identifiers/CSCs    * Nearly 1.8 million credits and contributors listings (just names and roles at this stage) By combining and crosschecking this information alone, we have already cataloged more games than any video game database to date. Our information is organized so it will be quick and easily searchable. We have not taken work from users' FAQs, reviews, or articles, and we will not take game manual scans from other databases unless granted express permission to do so. Users of our API are able to draw on all of this information for their apps. All uploaded images are automatically resized to meet a range of common size requirements. We are already tightly-integrated with OpenEmu and several other apps and media center frontends. We also have a blog with 90 articles and videos covering a wealth of topics related primarily to the history and culture of games, often in an in-depth journalistic fashion. Blog posts link to relevant game pages and draw wallpaper from these wherever possible. The blog is not searchable (except via a search engine like Google), but we do have a popular and similar articles sidebar. We use Joomla as our backend core, which has proved problematic in both maintaining and updating the code for everything (not to mention managing traffic spikes). This will change to a custom system built from scratch for Archive 2.0.2.0 Beta Launch (Near Future) Our 2.0 launch will begin with us displaying all of this data on our stunning new design and architecture. Every game page will feel like a home to its displayed game. Fast speed, in-depth search features, obsessive organization, and a very easy user experience will be our focal points — besides getting the data as accurate as possible, of course. We will allow users to embed videos (YouTube), to provide more information, and to rate the content hosted on our database. This stage will be our private 2.0 beta, which will allow users to browse our massive database and preview the tools we're giving users to add to our database — and generally to test everything so that it's all working as intended before the public rollout. It will be simplistic, but deep, with a wealth of factual video game information beyond what anyone has ever seen (or at least we think so). On the blog front, we'll spend this time testing new systems that allow greater flexibility in layout and leave room for totally-custom CSS as well as integration with the search feature. We'll be focusing on the database and the new website at this point, however, with articles ramping up again after public launch. For community and user profiles, we have yet to finalize the details, but you can expect something along the lines of the following either during the private beta or sometime soon after public launch:    * A simple profile page (much like the one registered users already have)    * Messages    * Friends    * Games lists and collections (app users already have a library collection feature available) We'll be listening to our beta users and will take all suggestions seriously. We of course have our own ideas for unique features, but this will pave the way for the features seen on our public launch.2.0 Public Launch (Future) At this point our database will not only be the largest factual, searchable database, but we will begin to make room for more in-depth content. We have big plans for the future of Archive, and will not only have support for content such as user reviews, manuals, history trees, guides, and much more, but will drive and reward our community for contributing to us. We are making an effort to give our users credit and proper spotlighting for their contributions. A website like this is nothing without its users and community, so your importance will not be overlooked. Archive will change and grow the way its users demand, unlike any other database around. On the blog, you can expect From The Archive (narrative playthroughs of random games) to return, along with a new game diary and hopefully lots of videos and reported features, while we'll also be heavily pushing community interaction on the forums. Elsewhere, we'd like to introduce a consoles/systems section, which would have overview text, in-depth histories, images, videos, and various relevant factual metadata. That is likely several months or more away, however, depending on your feedback. Ultimately, our database will be something that is vastly different from anything gamers have seen. Its vast amount of information, agile structure, and unique features will set us apart and make us a valuable resource to gamers everywhere. We realize that it's incredibly ambitious, but that's why we're taking it on in incremental steps. This is just a small vertical slice of our full roadmap, which goes into excruciating detail on what each feature is and how it will (or rather could) be implemented.

We’re a team of passionate gamers who all play an incredibly crucial role in Archive's development.
 (Ordered as below)
Ryan Niemann: Ryan Niemann is the big boss man at Archive. He's the team leader and the founder of Archive.vg. Archive was originally conceived as a much smaller-scale project (the website was actually almost called ViGi), but it has grown into much more — as you can all see. 
Richard Moss: Mossy is our hip-hop dancing blogger and our main content producer. He keeps us all in check with his mastery of the English language and without him everything would look like it was written by five year olds. He also writes for websites such as Ars Technica, Mac|Life, Polygon, and The Magazine.
Richard Dolinsky: Mr. Dolinsky is our resident database administrator. He manages the metric-boat-loads of video game info we store on our servers. He also holds two computer science degrees.
Craig Erskine: Craig is our UI/UX designer, frontend website developer, and Adobe Fireworks enthusiast/advocate. He produced all of the frontend code for Archive.
Auston Stewart: Auston is our mobile developer, and has created our nifty little Archive moble preview app. As author of an NES emulator, he's a minor celebrity in the retro gaming world.
Adam Hendrickson: Adam is our videographer at Archive. He also writes up the occasional blog when called for. Adam's the youngest of the group, and as the youngest he's always full of energy and easily excited. He's the driving force behind this lovely Indiegogo campaign :)
David McLeod: (Not Pictured) David is our professional scribbler and lead designer at Archive. He's the co-founder of our website and is currently working on our super secret 2.0 designs. Sadly he has never been photographed his entire life due to his secret life as an assassin. 
From time to time we have guest writers as well. Chris Baker has been kind enough to write up his takes on select retro games, and we'll have others over the coming months. 

We sometimes call Archive the IMDb of video games, but as you'll see what we're planning is much more than that. When Archive was originally conceived back in 2010, the goal was to be the largest searchable, factual video game database on the internet. But our ambitions grew as we realized how much potential there is in Archive's database being just one element of a grander project.
Our proof-of-concept website.

We want to develop a community, become a unique source of news and information that stands apart from the games media echo chamber, and support developers and researchers by providing an easy to use feature-rich tiered API system.  
The Database
One of our primary goals is preserving as much data about video games as possible. Video games are much more than ""games"" to us; they're history, and should be treated as such. Archive already has more games cataloged than any games website to date. You can check out our beta website at Archive.vg , but keep in mind that this is just a proof of concept and some things are broken. Behind the curtains we’ve got a ton of data for these 100,000+ games that’s not currently displayed. But we plan to show it all in Archive 2.0! Every game page will be populated with a plethora of information, carefully presented and laid out so as to not be overwhelming or confusing.
As you would expect, every game will have things such as screenshots, platforms, genres, release date, ESRB, developers, and all that other good stuff. Expect to see much more than this, though!
Every game will have its own videos tab, wallpapers, accurate multiplayer support information, community discussions, featured articles of interest from various sources, related games, box art, manuals, and much much more. And it's all searchable too! Plus we'll put together independent pages for video game consoles and computers. We’re presenting all of this information with one of the most incredibly simple and sleek-looking infrastructures around.
The Archive 2.0 database will be jaw-droppingly huge! All users will be able to make their own additions as well, to ensure we have the maximum amount of information for every game. And we don’t discriminate! This is for all games, from the oldest, most obscure retro (hello Elevator Fight for the Super Cassette Vision) all the way to PS4 and beyond. No watermarks, no limitations. Our collection of information is for everyone, and we want you to use it!
Early preview of our 2.0 Database Design

Where is this huge database from? Is it stolen *Gasp!*
Haha, no! Not at all. Anything Archive uses is based on datasets from a lot of people who have contributed to our project. These datasets include Fair Use information from sites like GameFAQs, MobyGames,  etc... We only use information which is Fair Use, and this includes many smaller public domain / user with permission data sets like TOSEC, GoodSets, etc. Information that we won’t be using are things like Descriptions or Overviews from other databases. Content written by their respective community are copyrighted to said websites, so they WILL NOT be used! We have also received significant contributions from sites that specialize in information about a single platform. Our website is designed to strongly encourage any user who wants to contribute to add to our website!
Any content added on our website will be credited to the original producers/creators of said content. We want our users to upload anything they've made that they want to share with us. We are doing our best to make sure everyone is given proper recognition. We’re all about the sharing of information on Archive.
We believe in complete transparency here, and we are in no way looking to profit off other people’s hard work! We know that you’ve worked hard to collect information, and proper recognition will be given out to anything we use! Neither our current 1.0 design nor our 2.0 future designs have a place for any kind of advertising.
We are not using any information that is not granted for public use, or that we have not been given direct permission to use. We love websites that collect information on a smaller, more focused scale and we have no plans, nor will we ever, to take anyone's hard work!
Content that we deem under fair use is only material that was intended for public use. All other game information that that is in our database is willingly given by users or other websites that have granted permission for public use in databases like ours. We aren't taking anyone's reviews or videos or FAQs or anything that they own, or have worked hard to create for a specific website. We have left it up to our users to upload any of the content they have made to add it to the website. We have already been around for a little while now (1.0 beta launched a year ago), and we have been building a community that has been happy to help us build and add information to our database that they have produced themselves.
 
How will Archive be different from other databases?
Content-wise, what we provide of each specific game goes beyond what any other database has to offer — with several unique features. Every game has systems in place (and lots of stuff already collected!) for videos (mostly embedded from sites like YouTube), manuals, full boxart, labels, screenshots and much more — all unwatermarked! I could make a very long list about the exact content our database has, and what we can possibly display on each game page, but this is largely dependent on what people want displayed and expect from Archive.
In terms of design and user interface, we’re looking pretty good as well! All of our features and designs are being created from the ground up just for Archive, with a lot HTML5 and other technical stuff to ensure we’re the fastest and coolest-looking cats around.
On the semi-technical side our advanced search features really help set us apart as well. We allow for an incredible level of depth for finding games. You’ll be able to search across every content field independently or in combinations. Also don’t forget about our API! We want other people to use our database as well, with our API built to support other developers and their projects.
 
The Editorial
We're not just about having a kick-ass database. We want to inform and entertain gamers of all stripes and colors, and for that we'll have a constant flow of original written and video content. Although we'll have reviews and some of the normal ""expected"" content for a video game website, we won't become JustAnotherGamesSite.com!
We want to write about topics that nobody knew they wanted to know about. We want to be creative with our topics and write about the old and the new! There are so many aspects of the video game world that are overlooked because they don't fit the narrow scope of existing editorial sites. We want our users to be informed about much more than who is winning the console war and the latest leveling tactics in Call of Duty. We will talk about old games in the context of new ones and discuss new titles in the context of old, and we'll always show some love to lesser-known releases.
Our articles and videos trace the history and culture of video games — not in some stuffy academic voice but in a way that takes you on a journey of discovery. We won't talk down to you, but nor will we expect you to know everything. We'll try to make you laugh, make you smile, and make you smarter and better informed about our shared passion. And we hope you will push us to go deeper and further in every direction. 
Early preview of our 2.0 Blog Design.

The Community
We want to develop a community at Archive like no other. We want to appeal to all gamers out there. We're looking to have highly detailed, customizable user pages. Users will be able to share what they're currently playing as well as let other gamers know the games and systems they love. Looking for some buddies to jump on Dark Souls with? Got it. Looking for someone to help you get in some training in Street Fighter VI? Got it.
We want to bring everyone together with our custom-built social features so gamers can truly unite. We'll be rewarding all our users for taking part in Archive as well. Adding to our database, taking part in discussion, and having an awesome user page will grab you some awesome perks within the website...but we can't give away too much info on this now!
The API 
Archive's new API will allow an unprecedented level of direct access to the Archive database of over 100,000 games. Whether you're developing an emulator for retro classics (like, say, OpenEmu, which uses our database to grab cover art and a few other tidbits), a personal organizer for your collection of next-gen games, or even just want to figure out some crazy stats; our API delivers a lot of information and media in a super easy-to-use package. We plan on developing a free tier which will blow even the paid tiers of our competition away, and hopefully in the near future our own paid tier which will give virtually unlimited access to our database. Developers get ready!
What else does Archive have to offer me?
The Application
The power of Archive in your pocket. Just like our website, we also have an early proof-of-concept mobile app available at http://archive.vg/mobile This will provide all of the features of Archive on the go. Although our current Beta release only supports iPhone, well be updating it for 2.0 to include an Android version and tablet support.

The Growth
Archive will grow, but how it will grow is up to you. We want to create the ultimate gaming website here so your opinions are invaluable. Our own roadmap has plenty of wiggle room on the direction of the website. Archive will be community-driven. A website for gamers built by gamers. No hidden agenda. We believe in complete transparency and we will constantly keep everyone up to date on where Archive is going and how we plan to get there.
The Launch
Deadlines are always difficult. We want to get Archive out as soon as possible so everyone can enjoy our features but we want to make sure that everything is in tip-top shape for our audience. We're shooting for our private beta launch to be somewhere between late 2013 and early 2014. Backers will be constantly updated on the status of Archive and when we have a solid date for our beta and public launches they will be the first to know. 
Why 2.0? Why not 1.0 or 1.1?
Archive's beta launch was based on our 1.0 design. Originally we planned to build upon this in small increments to achieve our goals, but as time went on our goals simply changed and we quickly learned the limitations of our current systems. We've learned a lot from our 1.0 launch. We went through a couple of different hosts, tried using Joomla! for our content management systems — with tweaks of our own — but in the end we learned that in order to create the best website possible we have to build Archive from the ground up.
Archive 2.0 is completely built off our own custom framework now and it’s super fast, and super accessible. Making something like this takes a lot of time and effort, but, realistically, if we want to create this ultimate resource, it needs to be done.
Our 1.0 Database


Besides taking part in one of the greatest gaming websites ever we've got some pretty cool benefits to anyone who contributes to our campaign. Here are some of the things you'll be getting!
Level I:
You have to start somewhere! Level I contributors will get their name listed on the Archive credits page, as well as receive a Donation emblem next to their username — which will be displayed on their user page and on the community forums. You'll be known forever as an Archive supporter!
Level II:
Level II contributors will get early access to the 2.0 beta. Before we unveil Archive 2.0 to the public we'll be doing an early beta launch for all select members where we'll be testing various features of Archive to make sure everything is in tip-top shape for the public reveal. Plus you will be getting all the previous rewards!
Level III:
Our Level III contributors will be taking a crucial role on Archive — that is, if they so choose. All contributors at this level will have access to a private developer-only forum where their concerns will be closely monitored and they can take part in helping the team decide on the future additions to the website. Plus you will be getting all the previous digital rewards!
Level IV:
At Level IV you'll be getting an awesome Archive poster. Hang it anywhere you want! On a train, in the bathroom or even on your neighbor's fence (ask first though). Here's what it'll look like! Plus you will be getting all the previous digital rewards!

Level V:
At Level V let Archive help keep your upper body clothed with this slick-looking super high-quality t-shirt. This T-shirt represents the many layers that go into creating Archive. Red representing out database; gray represeting our community API, and editorial; and white representing the many other features we offer for everyone. See sizing here and below you'll find a picture of the upper body protection kit. Plus you will be getting all the previous digital rewards!

Level VII:
You get it all! T-shirt, poster, and plaque. Now you can share your multiple gifts with your family and friends. (Or just keep it for yourself.)
Level VIII:
A one-on-one call or chat with the Archive team. Your opinions are incredibly valuable to us and we want to hear them. Have questions about our designs? Do you think you know a way to make Archive better, or just have features in mind you really want to see in a gaming website? We want to know what you expect and want from Archive, and we'll do our best to provide. Plus you will be getting all the previous rewards!
Level IX:
At Archive's ninth level you'll have your own part of Archive, forever! An easter egg of your choosing will be hidden within the website. You'll have complete control over what kind of easter egg it'll be and where it goes (as long as it's something plausible) You will be getting all of the other previous rewards at this point. We've got a couple easter eggs on the website now, can you find them? *Cough*try_the_konami_code*Cough*
Level X:
Watch a movie with the Archive team, and you pick the movie! We'll do a skype call with you and our team and take a breather and watch a flick. Grab some popcorn and a drink! Please don't pick Super Mario! + All Previous Rewards!

Despite us all being internet superheroes, we live very normal lives in the downtime. Most of us have full-time jobs, and Archive is a hobby project solely driven by our passion to create something amazing for gamers everywhere. We currently don't monetize Archive at all because we want to nail the quality and experience without shoving awful ads in your face, and we're far from ready to earn money through things like subscriptions or other alternative income streams.
But it's difficult to making something groundbreaking without a little help. That's why we're turning to Indiegogo.
All of your donations (minus the fees) will go right back into Archive. We love our small team, but we want our family to grow so we can constantly be on the cutting edge. We need money not only to support the current team but also to get some additional man (or woman-)power in place to push us into the stratosphere. 
Your donations will help us free up more time to work and to purchase new equipment. This means things such as recording equipment and new and more powerful computers.
Did I mention marketing? We want to make a dent, and not just a little one — we're talking a huge one! But getting a name out there is difficult with so many established players in the space. We'll spend a small slice of your donations on an awareness campaign that tells the world what we're doing and why Archive will leave websites like MobyGames and GameFAQs in the dust.
Here's a breakdown of Archive's finances, and what we'll be doing with all our donations.


Developers, Developers, Developers! We could use some extra hands on board. More often than not, recruiting help costs money. Whether it be someone to help us on our blog or to tune things under the hood, any new recruits will help speed up development time as well as help moving Archive forward from our 2.0 launch. We'll be putting $7,000 toward finding new help, and we'll add to this figure if we exceed our goal.

Pay ourselves! We all want to dedicate more time to Archive than we currently do, but that would mean taking time off of work. Archive will be crunching for the next couple months, and to make sure our launch goes as smoothly and quickly as possible some of us will need to solely dedicate our time to the project. We'll be putting $6,000 into ensuring 100% Archive manpower!

In order to keep up our team will need new equipment. Our video editor works from a desktop, but he'd really like to replace it with a new laptop because he's not as stationary as he used to be. With this he'll also need some HDMI recording devices and a camcorder for producing other video content for everyone to enjoy. This totals up to be around $2,000.


Getting our name out there! Since we want everyone to know about us, we will need to advertise. A couple months of solid advertising we not only help build our community, but will also help us build our website. $1,000!


We want to give back to our supporters! This one is up in the air since it's hard to see into the future, but we expect to spend around $6,000~$8,000 on fulfilling our contributors' rewards. 

Indiegogo and transaction fees of around $2,000. This is 4% if we're fully funded and 9% if not, plus 3% on each transaction paid via credit card. After this we're pretty much all out of money!
And what if we exceed our goals?
Server costs are around $600 a month, going up depending on the traffic. Last month we hit around $800 and we can only see this number increasing in the future. Around 40% of all donations above our original goals will contribute directly to hosting costs, so if we double our goals this would be approximately $10,000.

More Developers! Our family will extend even more and Archive’s 2.0 developments will be faster than the speed of light. We'll be putting about 25% of all the money beyond our initial goals to getting us all the help we can get. If we double our goals the total amount of money going toward this would be around $13,000.

We want our name to get out there, so we’ll be putting around 10% of any money over our goals to even more advertising. This number would be around $3,500 if we double our goal!

The rest of the money will be put into fulfilling awards and Indiegogo fees, so around 25% of any more over our goals will be put towards this cause. 
Note: We selected flexible funding because every dollar counts, and even money raised below the goal will help us push Archive onward and upward.
We currently pay everything out of our own pockets, so hopefully this will give you an idea of where your money will be going if you choose to take part in our project. We hope to see you all soon at our 2.0 launch!

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atari Vault</strong></p>
<p>This may be the most ambitious crowd-sourcing project to-date. With your support, we can make history and save a legend at the same time. Our goal is to preserve and share hit Atari titles while promoting the art of game development.</p>
<p><em>Preserving Atari Titles</em><br/>We plan to acquire the rights to classic titles like Asteroids, Missile Command, Pong, Breakout, Centipede and other hundreds of other timeless classics. For the retro gamers out there, we intend to release a compilation true to the original games. However, for the those looking for modern renditions, we plan to reinvent them with exciting takes on them to bring them into the 21st century.</p>
<p><em>Promoting the Art of Game Development</em><br/>Simply put... we plan to develop educational content  and use the Atari intellectual property to provide a foundation for the new projects - with students and collaborators working under the tutelage of a professional development team. Students will gain hands-on experience by participating as active members of the development team. Students, and others, may gain access to a source code library to learn what has been done in the past and build upon it as part of a hands-on development project. </p>
<p><em>Sharing Titles</em><br/>In order to obtain the rights to the hit classics, it is necessary to buy the brand and a portfolio of hundreds of other titles. Inevitably, we will determine that we cannot make productive use of specific titles; we plan to release those as (1) freely available for public use and (2) open-source code for you developers out there. We plan to go even further by releasing them in a way that would allow you to commercialize your creations yourself.</p>
<p>By setting up the guidelines for a code exchange, we hope to facilitate collaboration, renewed interest in the gaming industry, and spark advances in the field.</p>

<p><strong>Atari: Bankrupt and On-The-Ropes</strong></p>
<p>After being acquired by France-based Infogrames, Atari has found itself in financial distress. In January, 2013, the U.S. subsidiary filed for bankruptcy protection and approached 180 different companies seeking buyout offers. On May 23rd, Atari announced that it had had failed to receive one acceptable offer. Now, the gaming icon is on the auction block. Most likely, the company will be cannibalized and cease to exist as we remember it.</p>
<p>That is where American Southern University (ASU) steps in. The non-profit organization is launching what may be the most ambitious crowd-funding initiative to-date. It has launched a campaign to raise sufficient funds to save these titles - prior to the July 16th auction date. While the goal is certainly lofty, it is not impossible. Earlier this year, $4.2M was raised to launch a single title, ""Torment: Tides of Numenera"". Under the ASU plan, it will acquire hundreds and seeks to reboot many of those.</p>
<p>According to ASU President, Will Adkins, the proceeds will be used to establish a game development studio to deliver this project and offer a hands-on learning experience for students, reshape the whole development process in partnership with independent developers, and assume the role of steward for the Atari titles. As steward, ASU will evaluate each title. Where feasible, franchises will be rebooted and commercialized to support the on-going operations of the organization's academic mission. Other titles may be released as open-source code as part of an initiative to promote collaboration and learning from existing works.</p>
<p>ASU is seeking to unite the gaming community is preserving and rebooting select historic titles. <strong>Contributions to the 501(c)(3) non-profit may be tax-deductible and various rewards are being offered in return for your support.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atari Vault</strong><br/> When we use the term The Atari Vault, we are referring to the numerous titles in the Atari porftolio. A sample of these can be found beneath the project description provided here. Our immediate plans for The Atari Vault is summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop educational content that can be accessed online as well as those participating in residential training - this will cover the basics of game design and development.</li>
<li>Port hit titles to current platforms including the Web</li>
<li>Reinvent the classic titles to take advantage of current technology</li>
<li>Promote collaborative development by sharing code library</li>
<li>Acting as steward for software titles ensuring they are used and shared to their maximum potential</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Goals and Stretch Goals</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>$200k+ </strong> Aquire IP rights for as many De Minimis titles as possible (titles shown below).  It may also be possible to acquire one or more franchises being sold individually.</p>
<p><strong>$17MM</strong><br/> This is the minimal amount we project will be required to procure the Atari brand and the classic titles listed below.  It would not include De Minimis titles or those being sold separately.</p>
<p><strong>$30MM</strong><br/> At this level, we anticipate that we would have a strong opportunity to acquire the brand, classic titles, De Minimis titles, and those franchises being sold separately. The minimum bid for each of these are shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>RollerCoaster Tycoon - 3.5MM</li>
<li>Test Drive Unlimited - $1.5MM</li>
<li>Humongous Franchise - $500K</li>
<li>Backyard Sports - $750K</li>
<li>Total Annihilation - $250K</li>
<li>Airborne Ranger - $100K</li>
<li>Battlezone - $250K</li>
<li>Master of Orion - $100K</li>
<li>Moonbase Commander - $100K</li>
<li>Star Control - $100K</li>
</ul><p><strong>$38MM</strong><br/>Establish Atari Labs to foster collaborative development, reboot select titles, manage access to open-source code, license and support active titles, and develop new title to strengthen the brand.</p>
<p>In the likely event that we will not achieve this lofty goal, we will use proceeds to accomplish as many of these objectives as possible but not necessarily prioritized by the order given above.  If you have strong preferences to rescue specific titles, please indicate this in a comment to us.</p>

<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>* To do a reboot of the Atari franchise, if first requires that we acquire the intellectual property. The most likely challenge to this will be acquiring sufficient funding by the auction date.

Our goal is to establish a professional development studio which also gives students hands-on experience in developing a mainstream title.

By ensuring the code is reviewed and the work is properly supervised, we will mitigate this risk.<br/><br/>* As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, any surplus revenue from operations will be routed back into R&amp;D, operations, and game support. It cannot be diverted back to shareholders. This minimizes the risks of financial disarray like that experienced by Atari.</p>
<p>* Not all franchises will include source code, the right to generate deriviative works, or to distribute software as-is. Further, some titles were developed for older computing platforms and may not run ideally on modern systems.  These circumstances may limit our ability to fully accomplish our goals with all titles.</p>
<p>* Some reward levels may offer a certain number of copies of game software. If a reward level offers 50 copies, but we only acquire rights to distribute 45 titles, we will be unable to honor a request for 50 *different* titles.  However, the contributor may select multiple copies of the same title.</p>
<p>* Atari currently holds over 300,000 copies of software in physical inventory. Our goal is to acquire those as part of the bankruptcy auction. Our ability to deliver physical titles will be limited by the titles and quantity of software actually obtained.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p></div>","This particular project has been authorized by the ASU leadership team and is considered an official initiative of that organization.
 
The Atari Vault
This may be the most ambitious crowd-sourcing project to-date. With your support, we can make history and save a legend at the same time. Our goal is to preserve and share hit Atari titles while promoting the art of game development.
Preserving Atari TitlesWe plan to acquire the rights to classic titles like Asteroids, Missile Command, Pong, Breakout, Centipede and other hundreds of other timeless classics. For the retro gamers out there, we intend to release a compilation true to the original games. However, for the those looking for modern renditions, we plan to reinvent them with exciting takes on them to bring them into the 21st century.
Promoting the Art of Game DevelopmentSimply put... we plan to develop educational content  and use the Atari intellectual property to provide a foundation for the new projects - with students and collaborators working under the tutelage of a professional development team. Students will gain hands-on experience by participating as active members of the development team. Students, and others, may gain access to a source code library to learn what has been done in the past and build upon it as part of a hands-on development project. 
Sharing TitlesIn order to obtain the rights to the hit classics, it is necessary to buy the brand and a portfolio of hundreds of other titles. Inevitably, we will determine that we cannot make productive use of specific titles; we plan to release those as (1) freely available for public use and (2) open-source code for you developers out there. We plan to go even further by releasing them in a way that would allow you to commercialize your creations yourself.
By setting up the guidelines for a code exchange, we hope to facilitate collaboration, renewed interest in the gaming industry, and spark advances in the field.

Atari: Bankrupt and On-The-Ropes
After being acquired by France-based Infogrames, Atari has found itself in financial distress. In January, 2013, the U.S. subsidiary filed for bankruptcy protection and approached 180 different companies seeking buyout offers. On May 23rd, Atari announced that it had had failed to receive one acceptable offer. Now, the gaming icon is on the auction block. Most likely, the company will be cannibalized and cease to exist as we remember it.
That is where American Southern University (ASU) steps in. The non-profit organization is launching what may be the most ambitious crowd-funding initiative to-date. It has launched a campaign to raise sufficient funds to save these titles - prior to the July 16th auction date. While the goal is certainly lofty, it is not impossible. Earlier this year, $4.2M was raised to launch a single title, ""Torment: Tides of Numenera"". Under the ASU plan, it will acquire hundreds and seeks to reboot many of those.
According to ASU President, Will Adkins, the proceeds will be used to establish a game development studio to deliver this project and offer a hands-on learning experience for students, reshape the whole development process in partnership with independent developers, and assume the role of steward for the Atari titles. As steward, ASU will evaluate each title. Where feasible, franchises will be rebooted and commercialized to support the on-going operations of the organization's academic mission. Other titles may be released as open-source code as part of an initiative to promote collaboration and learning from existing works.
ASU is seeking to unite the gaming community is preserving and rebooting select historic titles. Contributions to the 501(c)(3) non-profit may be tax-deductible and various rewards are being offered in return for your support.
 
The Atari Vault When we use the term The Atari Vault, we are referring to the numerous titles in the Atari porftolio. A sample of these can be found beneath the project description provided here. Our immediate plans for The Atari Vault is summarized below:

Develop educational content that can be accessed online as well as those participating in residential training - this will cover the basics of game design and development.
Port hit titles to current platforms including the Web
Reinvent the classic titles to take advantage of current technology
Promote collaborative development by sharing code library
Acting as steward for software titles ensuring they are used and shared to their maximum potential
 
Goals and Stretch Goals
$200k+  Aquire IP rights for as many De Minimis titles as possible (titles shown below).  It may also be possible to acquire one or more franchises being sold individually.
$17MM This is the minimal amount we project will be required to procure the Atari brand and the classic titles listed below.  It would not include De Minimis titles or those being sold separately.
$30MM At this level, we anticipate that we would have a strong opportunity to acquire the brand, classic titles, De Minimis titles, and those franchises being sold separately. The minimum bid for each of these are shown below.

RollerCoaster Tycoon - 3.5MM
Test Drive Unlimited - $1.5MM
Humongous Franchise - $500K
Backyard Sports - $750K
Total Annihilation - $250K
Airborne Ranger - $100K
Battlezone - $250K
Master of Orion - $100K
Moonbase Commander - $100K
Star Control - $100K
$38MMEstablish Atari Labs to foster collaborative development, reboot select titles, manage access to open-source code, license and support active titles, and develop new title to strengthen the brand.
In the likely event that we will not achieve this lofty goal, we will use proceeds to accomplish as many of these objectives as possible but not necessarily prioritized by the order given above.  If you have strong preferences to rescue specific titles, please indicate this in a comment to us.

<li>Hello! We are Gaming Grounds a tabletop gaming store in Kent, Ohio. Who are we? We are the owners, Caitlin and Commodore Campbell, their daughters, Ellis and Cyan, and of course, our faithful players (we’d be nothing without them!).</li>
<li>Gaming Grounds is all about community. Anyone who walks in the door can be a part of the Gaming Grounds community, whether they’ve been playing these games their whole life or they’re brand new. But don’t take our word for it; on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/gamingxgrounds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook page</a> well over a dozen people have recommended our store, using words like “inviting” and “friendly” to describe us. In return we want to be a part of <em>their</em> community. We want to have come into this city and made a difference, no matter how small.</li>
<li>That’s why we’re running this campaign. We want to use the money you, OUR COMMUNITY, helps us raise, to give back. We want to give the store such a facelift it will be a shining beacon in the neighborhood. We will clean up, beautify, and safe-guard the property, and as much of the street as we can. With your help we want to show what a small business can achieve for its neighbors.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What We Need (&amp; What You Get)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are hoping to raise at least $5000. Here’s what we will do with the money:
<ul>
<li>The parking lot will be cleaned up, sprayed for weeds, and swept clear of all cigarette butts</li>
<li>There will be a designated smoking area, with proper disposal equipment</li>
<li>A bike rack will be put in</li>

Hello! We are Gaming Grounds a tabletop gaming store in Kent, Ohio. Who are we? We are the owners, Caitlin and Commodore Campbell, their daughters, Ellis and Cyan, and of course, our faithful players (we’d be nothing without them!).
Gaming Grounds is all about community. Anyone who walks in the door can be a part of the Gaming Grounds community, whether they’ve been playing these games their whole life or they’re brand new. But don’t take our word for it; on our facebook page well over a dozen people have recommended our store, using words like “inviting” and “friendly” to describe us. In return we want to be a part of their community. We want to have come into this city and made a difference, no matter how small.
That’s why we’re running this campaign. We want to use the money you, OUR COMMUNITY, helps us raise, to give back. We want to give the store such a facelift it will be a shining beacon in the neighborhood. We will clean up, beautify, and safe-guard the property, and as much of the street as we can. With your help we want to show what a small business can achieve for its neighbors.
What We Need (& What You Get)

We are hoping to raise at least $5000. Here’s what we will do with the money:

The parking lot will be cleaned up, sprayed for weeds, and swept clear of all cigarette butts
There will be a designated smoking area, with proper disposal equipment
A bike rack will be put in
A pressure washer will be rented to wash the building itself
The paint on the door and window casements will be touched up
There will be flowers planted by the large standing sign, the side of the building by the alley, and planters hung by the front door/windows
The large standing sign will be repaired, cleaned, and painted
Spot lights will be installed to point to the large standing sign
Motion lights and security cameras will be mounted on all sides of the building
A large, backlit sign will be purchased for above the front door
A fence will be installed between Gaming Grounds and the gas station next door to ensure the security and privacy of our players
We will obtain picnic tables for a new outdoor patio playing area
If we can raise enough, we would like to have a mural painted on the building
And this is just the beginning of what we would like to do! If we raise more than our goal, we’ll start getting to work on the inside too!



Should you choose to help us out, you will be generously rewarded! T-shirts, gift cards, rewards certificates, a thank you dinner, and more are all up for grabs!
If we cannot reach our goal, we will still use whatever we have raised to accomplish as much as we possibly can. Sometimes even a little can go a long way!
The Impact

Aside from being a toy, game, and hobby store, Gaming Grounds provides an open and welcoming environment where people of all stripes and all walks of life can come and have fun. See, it’s like this. In store we have a motto, “defy the meta”. In this context, we are referencing “metagaming”.  Defined as we use the term, it is “the environment that […] competitive […]gamers play in, in any given game, and the strategies used by those top competitive players”. The problem with metagaming, (and the reason we choose to “defy” it) is that when everyone is basing their strategy against, say a single card, or a single deck type, everyone ends up with the same type of deck, using the same kinds of cards. And that winning deck typically stays on top, without much variation. Are you with us so far?  The point is, in the more hardcore tournament scene, there isn’t a lot of creativity.

Dominants can choose objectives, kick unruly members, and are generally the ones in control. That does not mean their position is permanent or stable, as fights over the crown can happen depending on certain situations.

<p>In March 2013 NFL star Rob Gronkowski came to visit his #1 fan Tawfiq Baity who has cerebral palsy. Now the goal is to get Tawfiq to the Sunday night game Patriots vs Broncos 11/24!!</p>
<p>GRONK is helping out with tickets for Tawfiq and family to attend the game and GRONK is rolling the red carpet out once Tawfiq arrives in Boston. This is where we need the help of the entire Patriots fan base!! We have some expenses that needs to be taken care of for Tawfiq including travel, a special room with needed accessories, some spending cash for the family, and any unforeseen expenses. We are asking for $2,500.00 in hopes that we can get a bit more because the expenses are actually between $2,500.-$5,000 anything raised above that will be donated to a foundation of our choice that helps kids with cerebral palsy.</p>

<p>The Story:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>This story started in October 2012 when I met Tawfiq Baity who was a 16 year old boy that has cerebral palsy. I met Tawfiq at a football game between his high school the Lockport Lions and my alma mater Riverside high school. I must say Tawfiq is an amazing kid that has become my friend. He loves football and his favorite team is the New England Patriots and his favorite player is Patriots star TE Rob Gronkowski. While watching the between Lockport and Riverside Tawfiq told me that he never went to an NFL game and he would love to go to a game in Foxboro at Gillette Stadium. After hearing about his love for the Patriots and GRONK we tried to set it up for Tawfiq to attend a Patriots game and meet GRONK, but because of his condition traveling 10hrs by van would be difficult. At the same time this was being set up GRONK broke his forearm and was sidelined due to his injury. Me and Tawfiq had an idea to send GRONK a get well video and the video went viral and that was the get well video above.<br/><br/>This video would set the stage for Tawfiq to meet GRONK. GRONK was nice enough to surprise Tawfiq at with a surprise visit at Tawfiq's high school. This story went national from ESPN, New York Times, AOL homepage, CBS Boston and tons more. We captured everything and made a video of the story and thats the video you see above.<br/><br/>GRONK has returned from his injury and now I am attempting to help get Tawfiq to a Patriots game at Gillette Stadium. The game we are attempting to get Tawfiq to attend is November 24, 2013 when the Patriots face off against the Broncos. It's a Sunday night game and would be a great game for Tawfiq to see in person!!<br/><br/>Please help us make this happen for Tawfiq. He really deserves it! He is a great kid!! We are reaching out to the entire Boston area and Patriot fans across the world to help make this happen for Tawfiq. Lastly we will document the entire ordeal via video that Patriots fans can watch on Youtube!! Let's go Patriots!!</p>

<p>And so, the journey to DreamHack begins! We are Back2Back Gaming, a professional gaming team who travels around the globe to compete in video game tournaments.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>Who is Back2Back Gaming, and why are we here?</strong></h1>
<p>Shortly after being founded in 2007, we quickly became a powerhouse among other North American organizations. Only the most elite gamers in numerous games such as Counter-Strike and Call of Duty 4 represent Back2Back Gaming where they have competed in national events like WCG, ESEA, and ESWC. We are very passionate about our teams and our accomplishments in the competitive gaming scene. </p>
<p>In just a few months, with the support of YOU, our team is anticipating on representing North America as they compete at the undisputed world largest LAN event, DreamHack. Attending this event would not only set a precedent for North American Counter-Strike 1.6 talent, but also bring recognition to the number one ranked Counter-Strike 1.6 team in North America, globally. </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>What is DreamHack?</strong></h1>
<p>On June 16, 2012 the world’s largest digital festival and official world record as world’s largest LAN party in the Guinness Book of Records named DreamHack will be held in Jönköping, Sweden. During 2009, DreamHack reached over 200,000 unique visitors with their live activities around the World.</p>
<p><img alt=""DreamHack"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oi39.tinypic.com/35d27n4.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""DreamHack""/></p>
<p>DreamHack is focused on everything you can do with computers, Internet and digital entertainment and culture. DreamHack is a lot of gaming, communication, programming, designing, music composing and whatever you can imagine! They organize a lot of large tournaments, compos and also a great Expo with company’s like MSI, ASUS, Telia, Intel, Blizzard and many of the Swedish universities to name a few.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>What do we need to get there?</h1>
</div>
<div>
<p>The total cost of the trip is accumulates to roughly $8,000. The total number of Back2Back Gaming representatives that will be attending is 6 - the Counter-Strike 1.6 team (5), and a team manager (1)</p>
<p>The money that is raised will be allocated as listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roughly $6,000.00 will be spent on airfare expenses</li>
<li>Roughly $1,550.00 will be spent on hotel expenses</li>
<li>Roughly $700.00 will be spent on transportation expenses</li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<h2>What do you get for contributing?</h2>
<p>In exchange for your contribution, we are offering an array of different perks associated with the film. The amount of your contribution determines your perk level.  (See the different levels on the right.)</p>
<p>Our perks for contributing to our cause range from the affordable to the extreme. If you’re interested in lending a helping hand, $1 can get you a thank you and the warm feeling that goes along with knowing you are helping Back2Back Gaming travel to DreamHack or $1,000 can get you game time with the players! <br/><br/>We want to be open and interactive with our audience, so we are offering DVDs, PDF's, and t-shirts, but we are also wanting to reach out to you by giving you exclusive LIVE updates while we are at the event!</p>
<p><img alt=""T-Shirts"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oi43.tinypic.com/33ndqa9.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""T-Shirts""/></p>
<p>$8,000 is our goal, but even if we don’t reach our entire goal, we’re going to use every dollar to its full potential to travel to Jönköping, Sweden to compete at DreamHack.<br/><br/>Since our focus is on raising funds for travel right now, that doesn’t mean that $8,000 is all the support we need. We have production and post-production expenses, as well as a wide variety of marketing and advertising costs. Whatever you can give is greatly appreciated, and we will use it to benefit our end product in every way possible.</p>

</div></div>","And so, the journey to DreamHack begins! We are Back2Back Gaming, a professional gaming team who travels around the globe to compete in video game tournaments.
 
Who is Back2Back Gaming, and why are we here?
Shortly after being founded in 2007, we quickly became a powerhouse among other North American organizations. Only the most elite gamers in numerous games such as Counter-Strike and Call of Duty 4 represent Back2Back Gaming where they have competed in national events like WCG, ESEA, and ESWC. We are very passionate about our teams and our accomplishments in the competitive gaming scene. 
In just a few months, with the support of YOU, our team is anticipating on representing North America as they compete at the undisputed world largest LAN event, DreamHack. Attending this event would not only set a precedent for North American Counter-Strike 1.6 talent, but also bring recognition to the number one ranked Counter-Strike 1.6 team in North America, globally. 
 
What is DreamHack?
On June 16, 2012 the world’s largest digital festival and official world record as world’s largest LAN party in the Guinness Book of Records named DreamHack will be held in Jönköping, Sweden. During 2009, DreamHack reached over 200,000 unique visitors with their live activities around the World.

DreamHack is focused on everything you can do with computers, Internet and digital entertainment and culture. DreamHack is a lot of gaming, communication, programming, designing, music composing and whatever you can imagine! They organize a lot of large tournaments, compos and also a great Expo with company’s like MSI, ASUS, Telia, Intel, Blizzard and many of the Swedish universities to name a few.
 
What do we need to get there?


The total cost of the trip is accumulates to roughly $8,000. The total number of Back2Back Gaming representatives that will be attending is 6 - the Counter-Strike 1.6 team (5), and a team manager (1)
The money that is raised will be allocated as listed below:

Roughly $6,000.00 will be spent on airfare expenses
Roughly $1,550.00 will be spent on hotel expenses
Roughly $700.00 will be spent on transportation expenses

 
What do you get for contributing?
In exchange for your contribution, we are offering an array of different perks associated with the film. The amount of your contribution determines your perk level.  (See the different levels on the right.)
Our perks for contributing to our cause range from the affordable to the extreme. If you’re interested in lending a helping hand, $1 can get you a thank you and the warm feeling that goes along with knowing you are helping Back2Back Gaming travel to DreamHack or $1,000 can get you game time with the players! We want to be open and interactive with our audience, so we are offering DVDs, PDF's, and t-shirts, but we are also wanting to reach out to you by giving you exclusive LIVE updates while we are at the event!

$8,000 is our goal, but even if we don’t reach our entire goal, we’re going to use every dollar to its full potential to travel to Jönköping, Sweden to compete at DreamHack.Since our focus is on raising funds for travel right now, that doesn’t mean that $8,000 is all the support we need. We have production and post-production expenses, as well as a wide variety of marketing and advertising costs. Whatever you can give is greatly appreciated, and we will use it to benefit our end product in every way possible.

<p>So you are probably wondering what I would be using the money for, right? The reason I am requesting a higher amount of money is that I need to book a location for the business inside of the McKinley Mall. I would like to make sure that I have the lease paid for a year plus any internet bills that would come with it so that all the customers can connect to their online gaming accounts when need be..</p>
<p>The other parts of the money will be used for buying the products needed to run the gaming store (LED TV's, A few Xbox 360's, Wii U's, PS3's, the new Xbox One's, Games, furniture, and much more.). When I get all of the items purchased and ready to go, I then need to finally hire people to come work for me in the first store so that they can be trained to open a second one down the road.</p>
<p>The last thing I would need this money for is to hire someone to create a new program for me that will store members in my computer and display there updated ranking scores in my system. The ranking system allows players to spend points that they earn from entering tournament or inviting friends on new video games of their choice or a new console.

<p></p></div>","Game Develop is not an usual software, it's a complete and easy to use creation tool.With Game Develop, all you need is great ideas and some spare time to create games. And the best of all is that you do not need to know any complex programming language or subtle concepts to use GD! Artists, graphists, developers, marketers, children... anyone can use Game Develop!Keep reading to know why it is magic and how you can help us bring it to new OS and accelerate its development.""Blazing Inferno of Space"", a game created with Game Develop!First, here is an awesome fact: Game Develop is already available as a ""Pay What You Want"" software for Windows and Ubuntu! Just go on the official website and grab a copy! You can download it for free or donate any amount you want.
 What can I do with GD?
Any kind of 2D games.If you have an idea, just fire up Game Develop, create a new project, import some images and start adding them on the screen. Then, define how they interact and your first prototype will be ready in less than a few hours!If you're curious about how GD works, read the end of the description, and you'll get a nice overview of the innovative event system that GD uses to make everyone able to create games!However, developing such an ambitious piece of software requires a lot of time 
and money. The goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to develop an export option for iOS and Android and to improve the Ubuntu and Windows versions!
 First goal: Export games to iOS and AndroidHaving a game that can be played on iOS and Android is
 a must for any game developer. The goal of this campaign is to add a real export option allowing Game Develop to build games for these platforms! The funds will allow us to do intensive tests on an iPad and spend extra time on Game 
Develop to make some much needed improvements to the game engine and add an export option so that
 games run smoothly on iPhones, Android smartphones and tablets.These platforms are growing at a fast pace, and specific features like games monetization will be created for them!With your help, Game Develop will be the first free software on Windows and Ubuntu allowing anyone to create games for iOS and Android! Again, contributors will have access to beta versions and will be able to get better support for smartphones sooner!
 Second goal: Bring GD to MacOS and make Ubuntu a first class citizen for Game DevelopUbuntu and MacOS are both great platforms, but they currently lack such a nice game creation tool! Linux or MacOS enthusiasts often complain about the lack of games for their platform: Game Develop will allow to build and play games on Ubuntu and MacOS.When

 the goal of this campaign is reached (2200€), we'll be able to spend more time 
on Game Develop (alas, we can't live on love alone, we need funds to 
work on GD!) and get a MacBook. This is required for porting GD to MacOS: with your help, MacOS users will have access to the first free and complete game creation tool for this system!We'll extensively develop and test GD on 
Ubuntu so that it will be fully cross platform and working flawlessly on
 Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows. With your donations, we will make MacOS and Ubuntu great platforms for creating 2D games!Note that contributors choosing a perk with a value of €20 (or more) will have access to beta versions, so that you'll be able to test the new MacOS version or the improvements made to the Ubuntu version very soon! First OS X beta versions should be delivered about two or three months after the fundraising goal is reached, and Ubuntu version will be improved even before.
 Third goal: New and improved features by hiring one or more developersWhen reaching more than €4000, we'll be able to hire full time developers to put more working hours in
 improving an extension or a specific feature, while we keep working on 
GD. Check the list of features that could be done below! Note that if 
you choose the ""Ask for a specific feature"" perk, you'll be able to pick which feature gets the most priority!Each additional €1000 will allow us to hire developers again for a new feature or to improve an existing one. This will accelerate a lot the development of Game Develop and ease the work of developers using Game Develop!Here are the features that will be developed:
A new particle engine, for HTML5 games. For now, native games created with GD can use a particle engine to create visual effects, but games exported to the web can't. The new particle engine will be available for HTML5 games so that gamers will enjoy seeing realistic fires, explosions and other nice visual effects.


Dynamic lights, for HTML5 games. Create and play to games with realistic shadows and lights! Also perfect to create dark ambiances, fog or games with limited line of sight.





Port the extension to draw shapes on screen to HTML5 games. This feature is perfect for creating advanced effects like a laser gun.


Sound object for HTML5 games. This object help adding sound effects on a scene. It will be adapted so that games exported for the web and mobile can use it!


Editor improvement: dropdown lists and autocompletion to quickly fulfill parameters of conditions or actions

New tutorials. We'll use our time to create new tutorials that will enable developers to master every aspect of Game Develop!


New templates. There are already a lot of examples bundled with GD, but still we can create new one! They are a must have when creating a new game.

New features being developed thanks to the funds raised during the campaign will be announced on the forum, the facebook page and twitter so that you'll be able to follow their development.And remember that you can choose to offer to some of these features a higher priority by choosing the ""Ask for a feature"" perk!
 And as a bonus! Registering Game Develop on Steam GreenlightSteam Greenlight is a nice way for the community to help promote which games or software should be added to the service.Alas,
 as a developer, there is a €99 fee required to register an application 
on Steam. €99 will be reserved to pay these fees and the community will 
then be able to see Game Develop on Steam Greenlight and vote for it so 
that it get permanently listed on the Steam store! This is an exciting way to make GD even more visible! The steam community will have access to  a 100% free and complete game development tool. When GD is registered on Steam and when we reach €6000, we will also work on integration with Steam Workshop. Developers will be able to share their creations and custom content, such as sprites, sounds... in Steam Workshop and their projects to help the community with examples. Tell me more about GD!
Game Develop interface is intuitive and fast! Most other software for creating games has a very complex interface - with a lot of scary buttons, requiring you to do complex things to get the simplest results. 
With GD, everything that you need is displayed on the screen. The ribbon at the top of the window is context sensitive - switching to the appropriate tab depending on whether you are editing a scene or an event sheet.It is sleek and shiny! Wtih beautiful icons that were especially made for GD, carefully crafted editors so that you can discover the new features easily and try them with a couple of clicks. Clean, efficient and beautiful. And it's fully skinnable, so you'll feel at home.
 But hey, if programming is not required, how does it works?Here are a few awesome facts: you do not need to write lines of codes or know complex programming languages in order to use GD.The game logic is built using events. Events are so nice. An event is composed of a list of conditions and a list of actions: when conditions are met, actions are executed.Here, when a missile collides with an object called ""bad guy"", they both get destroyed.It's that simple.This is one of the advanced examples bundled with GD: Events allow to create complex games with advanced behaviors and gameplay.This innovative system is so flexible that it can really do anything that can be done using a programming language.

 Take a look at some already existing nice features!
Integrated, easy to use, physics engine, to simulate realistic behaviors.



Platformer engine. Just add it to your object to start creating a platformer game.



Pathfinding. Your object will be able to move and avoid obstacles. Nice for tower defense games and building AI!


Easy to use actions and conditions to create action games, top down shooter, racing and puzzle games...

Game Develop has tons of other features that allow developers to create awesome games without coding! You can also take a look at games created with GD on this page!

<p>Here comes the <b>Golden Age of Civilizations</b>, a semi turn-based MMO strategy game, inspired, but not followed by the classic games of the genre, such as <b>Age of Empires</b>, <b>Civilization</b> and <b>Rise of Nations</b>; mixed up with MMO capability and flavored with the best parts of other good online games.</p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Gábor Auth, a Java developer, a Linux administrator, an IT architect, organizer of some meetups topic of Java and IT in Hungary and speaker of some IT conference. Here is my CV:</p>
<p><a href=""http://wiki.javaforum.hu/display/~auth.gabor/Curriculum+Vitae"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://wiki.javaforum.hu/display/~auth.gabor/Curriculum+Vitae</a></p>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>I have a dream: I'm going to create an MMO strategy game! :)</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/761500/files/20140802105537-an_enemy_appeared.png?1407002137"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The players can move or act with their units on the map, build new cities and units, build and improve resources nearby their cities and facilities in their cities. The improved resource (farmland, forest, mine, ...) gives more production to the nearby city and the improved facilities (barrack, wall, court, ...) give more power to the player's units and cities.<br/></p><p>The game is semi-turn-based, each unit type has a different time to next move or act after the previous action, so that (for example) you move your Settlers unit at 10pm if the last action has been performed at 8pm with this unit because of the Settlers unit has two hours per action ""speed"".</p><p>The players choose technologies to research to improve their cities and units and allow to build new units or facilities. You can earn technology points and you can improve your technology point income by improve facilities in your cities and improve resources nearby your cities.</p><p>The players can initiate negotiations with the neighborhoods, so that you have the decision to declare war, make peace, remain neutral or organize an empire with them.

</p></div>","Here comes the Golden Age of Civilizations, a semi turn-based MMO strategy game, inspired, but not followed by the classic games of the genre, such as Age of Empires, Civilization and Rise of Nations; mixed up with MMO capability and flavored with the best parts of other good online games.
Who am I?
My name is Gábor Auth, a Java developer, a Linux administrator, an IT architect, organizer of some meetups topic of Java and IT in Hungary and speaker of some IT conference. Here is my CV:
http://wiki.javaforum.hu/display/~auth.gabor/Curriculum+Vitae
What is it?
I have a dream: I'm going to create an MMO strategy game! :)The players can move or act with their units on the map, build new cities and units, build and improve resources nearby their cities and facilities in their cities. The improved resource (farmland, forest, mine, ...) gives more production to the nearby city and the improved facilities (barrack, wall, court, ...) give more power to the player's units and cities.The game is semi-turn-based, each unit type has a different time to next move or act after the previous action, so that (for example) you move your Settlers unit at 10pm if the last action has been performed at 8pm with this unit because of the Settlers unit has two hours per action ""speed"".The players choose technologies to research to improve their cities and units and allow to build new units or facilities. You can earn technology points and you can improve your technology point income by improve facilities in your cities and improve resources nearby your cities.The players can initiate negotiations with the neighborhoods, so that you have the decision to declare war, make peace, remain neutral or organize an empire with them. Each empire has a government type (despotism, monarchy, republic, ...), so that the suitable players will be officers in the government of own empire.
Where is it?I started working on my game six months ago. I researched the possibly best architecture based on cutting edge technologies and industrial best practices, it is scalable vertically (better and bigger hardware) and horizontally (more hardware).
I deployed it on DigitalOcean's cloud, I bought a domain name and SSL certifications, so I spent only a little more than $100 on this project, thanks a lot to open source and cloud technologies!So, I do not need your money for expensive hardware and software components, I will focus only the game development and hire subcontractors for artworks and other tasks that I can't do.
Some technology facts about the project:

Agile development
Open source (LGPL 2.1)
Based on Java, JavaEE and JavaScript
The primary target platform is HTML5 browser
The secondary target platform is Android
The third target platform is iOS (and/or Windows Phone)
Would you like to try it?

I have not finished yet, it runs only in browsers (first Android application coming soon). I want to release early and release often, so the current version is very simple: you can move with your units only, but the feature set is growing week-to-week:
v0.0.2 (current): move with your units
v0.0.3 (planned release 08/17/2014): build cities and train units in your cities

...
v1.0.0 (planned release 06/28/2015): go live (production servers)
What do I need?
So, this is my hobby project and now I arrived at the crossroads:

I will quit my job and start working on this project as a full-time job :)
I cannot finish this project :(
I prefer the first option, but I will need to buy some bread and milk at the grocery everyday, so I need your help: my gross salary approximately $3,000 per month, and I think, I will push to production this game after 5-7 months...  so, I need only six months and my dream comes true... :)When do you get it?I have a fixed-length contract with my employer till 12/31/2014, so that I will start the full time work on this project from the beginning of 2015.

Use your finger to control your character and form closed spheres that will absorb enemies and increase your score and multiplicator. The latter will increase faster if you perform advanced moves like simultaneous or consecutive kills adding depth to the gameplay. 
The prototype will feature two enemy types: predator, which follows you killing you with direct contact and glibber, which is always trying to maintain a certain distance to the player. It will also already include most gameplay elements and thus  you a very good look and feel of what the final game will be like.

You’re under the impression that your island has become an epic place, prosperous, brightly lit and exceedingly busy.

The only way out? Fixing the Phoenix of course… only after you find its ten missing parts that have been scattered, one way or another, all over the island.

Although - as a casual player - a complete playthrough of a single storyline without playing any additional side-missions, you can expect the game to last a minimum of 5 hours, not counting replay value for the other storylines or game endings.<br/><br/><b>Q: Do you plan to offer any physical rewards? </b><br/>A: Not at this time. Our organization is not set up to handle the logistics.

An hour? Two? A day? Whatever you’ve had to deal with, the island of Cedaria probably has you beat - it’s been several months now, and the end is nowhere in sight.Cedaria is a top-down 3D adventure game in a Middle Eastern steampunk setting. It features crafting, an extensive dialogue system and multiple dynamic endings that are affected by how you play the game.The game takes place on an island in an alternate reality, some time at the end of the 19th century. As a player, you will be returning to your homeland, Cedaria, after several years of absence, having heard that the island has flourished under the patronage of the one and only Phoenix, a brilliant machine unlike no other, invented by a certain Lawrence Audlington who thought electrical cables were too old-fashioned and unbecoming, thus giving birth to a wireless method to distribute electricity. You’re under the impression that your island has become an epic place, prosperous, brightly lit and exceedingly busy. So it comes as a shock when your steamboat nudges the docks of Angel Wharf and all you see is darkness.Ugly, stifling darkness. As you poke about, you learn that someone has sabotaged the Phoenix, and the whos and whys of the case still remain a mystery, and you soon realise that the many changes the island underwent during the last few months have already started to affect you… you are trapped, just like everybody else. The only way out? Fixing the Phoenix of course… only after you find its ten missing parts that have been scattered, one way or another, all over the island. Piece of cake.Or is it? Your decisions, no matter how simple, will determine how everything plays out. If you play your cards right and assemble the Phoenix, you may be able to reconcile the different segments of the population and become a hero. But then again… there’s no rule forcing you to be “good”. “The Middle Eastern and Steampunk is something never done before and looks fantastic. The concept art also gives me the impression that this project isn't run by your average run in the mill artists. It seriously feels like work you see out of a AAA studio.” - At7addak  “The concept art looks amazing, the characters appear well crafted and the story leans toward the traditional RPG “unite the land” gameplay structure that works so well for these types of games.” - Gaming Illustrated“With a combination of middle-eastern and steampunk architecture, the world of Cedaria seems like a rich fantasy world, yet one that is deliberately analogous to our own.” - Awesome GamesSeveral Storylines: There are a number of storylines in the game; this increases replayability and offers more dynamic and choice-based endings.Who-Dun-Its: The storylines revolve around who or what sabotaged the Phoenix, and you will have to find clues leading to the identity of the culprit, rather than just find and assemble the machine parts.Crafting: You will be able to craft items that will help you in your quest to restore the Phoenix machine to working order.Dialogue System: Our dialogue system offers extensive conversation trees with multiple outcomes in every interaction. Since this is a choice-and-consequence game, dialogue plays an important part in the final outcome.14 Zones: The island has 14 unique zones that you are free to explore at your own leisure without having to get any pesky achievements beforehand.Multiplayer: Multiplayer is supported throughout the game; Cedaria plays equally well in both singleplayer and cooperative modes, and includes common tools such as a chat window and a lobby to facilitate multiplayer.Welcome to the fictional island of Cedaria. Whether you are coming through Angel Wharf aboard your ship, or flying your zeppelin to Wisteria Pier, you will most definitely find something for you.The island is home to the Vaytoris, Kythiens, Thunes and Ozars, four clans distributed - unevenly - among the 14 different zones. The clans have different political ideologies, ranging between authoritarian, conservative, communist and pacifist, and find it quite difficult to get along. With the breakdown of the Phoenix, they found more reasons to hate each other, what with the Vaytori kidnapping Kythiens to make use of their magic, and the Thunes hoarding all the island’s coal reserves, and the Ozars preparing to rebel against their marginalization. One of the island’s many factions, known as FATE (short for Foundation for the Advancement of Tolerance and Equality), has been trying to keep things calm on all fronts, but lately its efforts have been failing in face of the increasing hostility. Meanwhile, other factions like the Aeronaut Alliance are merely trying to keep an ex-pirate by the name of Captain Silas Burcombe out of their ranks.Silas is not the only “colourful” person living on the island; Cedaria features a full cast of NPCs each with their own ideals and goals, and we will be revealing more of them in future updates to give you a taste of what to expect in the game. For Cedaria we are using a mix of Lebanese and Ottoman architecture from the 19th century as a basis and infusing them with elements of Victorian era steampunk to create a unique art style.The old Lebanese architecture is distinguished by its arches, big windows, small doors and famous red tile roofs. The arches of the upper floors were designed in a way that gave buildings an aesthetically-pleasing appearance. The big wooden windows were intended to let in as much light as possible, as there was no electricity back in those days. You can read more about how we incorporated this style on our blog. As for the steampunk elements, there was focus on producing some magnificent machines and factories that would reflect the industrial boom the island went through with the invention of the Phoenix machine. Below you will see some early sketches of airships that we went through in order to decide what they will eventually look like in the game. The sound and music will be designed to support and reinforce the art style we are going for. Each zone will get its own unique theme, and in addition we will have recurring themes like combat music and tension music.Our plan is to use and mix in a lot of Middle Eastern instruments and if time and budget permits, we will also record with vocals and live instruments! Our goal with the soundtrack is to make it memorable so you will want to listen to it also outside the game. Help us make an awesome soundtrack!We have already received a grant that helped us develop a significant part of Cedaria: Blackout. However, we still need more money to make some finishing touches and ensure that the game reaches its full potential. For this reason, we came to Indiegogo. In the pie chart below, you can see what the money raised will be spent on. Cedaria: Blackout is a collaborative effort between Search for Common Ground, a Lebanese team and Matsuko, a group of veteran developers with previous experience from several AAA video games like Assassin's Creed I, Assassin's Creed II, Far Cry 2, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures and The Secret World.For more information on each individual team member, check out their blurbs here.We realize not everybody might be able to pledge to our Indiegogo campaign; after all, money doesn’t grow on trees or rain down from the skies (though can you imagine how awesome that would be?), but if you think Cedaria: Blackout is a game that should make its goal, you can help us by tweeting about our campaign, liking and sharing on Facebook and just letting your friends know about it.If you’re a blogger or a member of any forums or gaming news websites, feel free to post about the campaign and submit a tip about it! We’re going to be trying our best to spread the word as well, but with the release date looming upon us, we may be just a little busy working on the game itself!         Q: How big is the game? A: The game contains 14 unique zones and multiple storylines. It would be difficult to estimate how long the game is in game hours, since the storylines are built in such a way that you yourself can determine when the game ends. Although - as a casual player - a complete playthrough of a single storyline without playing any additional side-missions, you can expect the game to last a minimum of 5 hours, not counting replay value for the other storylines or game endings.Q: Do you plan to offer any physical rewards? A: Not at this time. Our organization is not set up to handle the logistics. However, if there is a big interest in this, we might arrange for you to get permission to use the artwork from the game to design your own t-shirts, cups and wallpaper online. Q: What languages will you support? A: The game will support English and Arabic. We may add additional languages if we hit additional stretch goals. It will be up to the community to decide exactly which languages we should localize for!Q: What is your stance on Digital Rights Management (DRM)? A: There are no draconian DRM solutions in place and you can play the singleplayer version whenever you like. For the cooperative version of the game, it requires us to have game servers online to route traffic, and we plan to have these game servers online for several years. Q: What platforms will be supported? A: At the moment, only Windows. However, we'd love to be able to make this game accessible to Mac and Linux users; we hope to add this as a stretch goal, but that depends on how things go with the campaign. Q: How can I upgrade my pledge? A: Indiegogo does not support this, so if you would like to upgrade your pledge from... say $30 to $50, simply pledge an amount equal to the difference (i.e. $20 in this case), then send us an email at cedaria@sfcg.org letting us know of your increased contribution and the new reward you would like.

The Livestream was an amazing success with nearly $11,000 in donations across all platforms. The laser cutter Chinook Crafts intends on buying is that much closer! However, now that the livestream is done there is still time to be a hero! Their machine is going to cost nearly $25,000, and there is a long way to go!Please continue the support here at the Chinook Crafts GoFundMe 
campaign. This site has no fee's and every dollar goes to the cause:http://www.gofundme.com/chinookcraftsfire

You can also buy directly from their Etsy page to help support https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/ChinookCrafts
ULTIMATE STRETCH GOAL ACHIEVED!$10,000 (from all sources)Proton Jon, played Kaizo World (Super Mario World Rom Hack)A BIG THANK YOU! We did it!:With the Livestream finally over, a big round of applause to Protonjon for hosting the event. The Indiegogo is continuing until midnight, so feel free to keep on contributing to support Chinook Crafts and the finding of their new machine.
About the Campaign:  Chinook Crafts is a local Calgarian Crafts shop that specializes in fun and nerdy crafts.  On Feb. 4th, their laser cutter caught fire while doing its usual cuts and is entirely destroyed.  This time of the year is normally when they would be building up stock for the summer when they tour around Canada attending over a dozen conventions making a living off of their works.  Currently they are faced with the possibility of cancelling some of their current shows.


  This IndieGoGo campaign exists to supplement their current GoFundMe donations drive during our 24 hour livestream. In addition to funding Chinook Crafts, you will also be able to buy some handcrafted items donated by the Otafest Pokemon League, and also challenge the livestreamers by temporarily imposing restrictions on them during gameplay.   GoFundMe did not have the structure to handle rewards like what is offered in this campaign.



The livestreamers that are donating their time and skill to this event are:


ProtonJon - A rather famous name in the Let's Play community.  He's run panels at PAX East for the past few years, and has over 180,000 Youtube Subscribers and almost 30,000 followers on Twitch.  He gained a lot of popularity playing Mario Rom Hacks, and hasn't played them for a few years due to a self-imposed ban.  For the sake of this livestream, he's agreed to temporarily lift his ban IF we reach our stretch goals!
SolarPrimal - One of the new additions to the Otafest Pokemon League this year to help with events and graphic design.  He is currently doing a Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess playthrough on his Let's Play Youtube channel to add to his lengthy list of playthroughs.
SlurpeeNinja - A talented Megaman Speedrunner who recently participated in the AGDQ Charity Livestream to raise money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
Vespher - On his channel he has an impressive speedrun of Metroid Fusion, completing it in only 52 minutes. Regular playthroughs run around 10-12 hours to complete the game!
Tiranuuhl  - Hardcore gamer and member of Chinook Crafts.  He helps with the projects that require some Photoshop magic.
   All in all, we hope to raise as much as we can to help Chinook Crafts out.  We plan to have a lot of fun during the Livestream, so please join us for a night of hilarity.  If you can't donate, please spread the word. 

The livestream will be held on Feb.15th starting at noon MST and ending on Feb. 16th at noon MST on ProtonJon's Twitch Channel linked below:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>With Cohorts of Kargonar we want to explore old ways of RPGs in a new style and combined with innovative elements.</p>
<p>This fantasy game has had a lifespan of 4 years already - no joke. It was created on April 2008 by a novice programmer and a novice artist, yet within these 4 years both became experienced and passionate amateur game creators. We are both students and fund the project from our own pockets, and this is what this campaign is about:</p>
<p>Creating a game is expensive, and when you're a student it burdens your wallet even more. It worked out so far, but now our pockets are literally empty. After 4 years of development we are very close to releasing the first open beta with 20+ hours of gameplay (end of April at the latest) and we are very excited about it, yet we lack the funds to take that last jump. Let me explain what we need it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server: The live server has to be able to carry some weight. What if 100 players want to play the game the same time? We have to be prepared for that in order to not ruin their experience.</li>
<li>Cutscene: We are working on a cutscene for the end of the ""Arlinthan part"" (Spoiler alert: that's when you leave known and trusted lands to find aid in the vast Highlands)</li>
<li>Artist: Although we do a lot of the art ourselves we have a unit artist who creates awesome units you fight against, fight with or quest for, e.g. <a href=""http://www.cok-game.com/graphics/units/battlemaster_t.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Battle Master"">our beloved battle master</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In February of 2011, a game called “Stars of The Universe” was conceived.</p>
<p>In this world, other humanoid races exist outside our own Milky Way galaxy. Humans begin to strike out into the cosmos, slowly understanding the complexity of their newly explored galaxy as they go. Their objective is to discover other planets that can support human life, and seeking life wherever it may be. The human race, with comparatively primitive technology and short life spans, were not able to travel to many of the solar systems due to the time/space limitations of their current technology. In order to get to adjacent galaxies, it would take many years and use too many resources (like food, energy, air, etc.) due to the time it takes to get there. They began to chart the galaxies at approximately a distance of 12 light years in all 6 axes so they can explore other cultures on different planets. They also have hopes of acquiring the new technologies that they discover in their galactic pursuit of knowledge. They know they need to create or discover a Faster-Than-Light-Speed drive or Time-Travel technology in order to increase the speed of their exploration, and thus continue outward into the universe. </p>

<p><strong>Game Features: </strong></p>
<p>One of the proposed game features includes its dual screen capability, which allows the player to operate with more efficiency. They can use the second screen for a panoramic view of the world, or assign statistical monitoring, or both while using a heads up display overlay. The game has the ability to be played as an RTS (Real Time Strategy), RPG (Role Playing Game), FPS (First Person Shooter) and MMO (Massively Muti-Player Online). The most impressive way to play this game is in cooperative game play mode. Two or more players can join together and play any race, in either top-down (bird’s eye view) or FPS mode. They can play either as a commander of troops or use their FPS skills in combat game play.</p>
<p><strong>IndieGoGo Goal</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this IndieGoGo project is to get funds to buy all the software licenses, hardware, office space, and talent needed to make this game go from concept to reality. The software licensing we need includes multiple copies of the applications for creating games. Obtaining the applications (like 3D Studio Max, Maya, Lightwave, Unity Engine, Sony Vegas, Visual C, etc.) is a very expensive proposition. To make this game work we also need fast computers, cameras, lights, video and audio equipment, etc. Many of this has been purchased already by one of our founders, but more is still needed. With a group of 10 people working from home we cannot ensure the game would be made on time, with competitive quality and standards. We need an office space as a central location to coordinate with each other in person.</p>
<p>Why IndieGoGo? David Cervera, the CEO of HiXeXin LLC, has spent much time refining the game idea by creating the specification. He has come to IndieGoGo because with the right investors, this amazing idea can come to life. With prizes offered as incentives, we think it will happen. What do you think? We’d love to hear it.</p>

In February of 2011, a game called “Stars of The Universe” was conceived.
In this world, other humanoid races exist outside our own Milky Way galaxy. Humans begin to strike out into the cosmos, slowly understanding the complexity of their newly explored galaxy as they go. Their objective is to discover other planets that can support human life, and seeking life wherever it may be. The human race, with comparatively primitive technology and short life spans, were not able to travel to many of the solar systems due to the time/space limitations of their current technology. In order to get to adjacent galaxies, it would take many years and use too many resources (like food, energy, air, etc.) due to the time it takes to get there. They began to chart the galaxies at approximately a distance of 12 light years in all 6 axes so they can explore other cultures on different planets.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’ve loved video games since forever, and my absolute favorites are role-playing games. Chrono Trigger. Skies of Arcadia. Shining Force. Star Ocean. And the grand-daddy of them all: Final Fantasy.<br/><br/>These stories have always thrilled me... but SOME thing always seemed to be missing. And now that I am older, I put my finger why I felt that way. Back in the day, there weren’t very many LGBTQ+ folks or people of color that were represented in a positive light in popular games. These days, we know representation is more important than ever before - but we still don’t have a lot of stories told from those perspectives. That’s why I’m so passionate about “Straukus: Keys of Aeterna.” I’ve been building this world and defining these characters for more than 20 years (since I was in high school). I want to create the game I wished I could have seen myself in when I was a kid.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our target is to hit $8,000 (USD) in 60 days.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bulk of funding will go to overhead expenses: licensing for editing software, internet access, publishing costs, animation materials, marketing and promotions, and so forth. But there is a whole team of people involved in production: the music director, the voice cast, the artists and designers, and of course the developers are all putting in the work to make this happen. It is as much a labor of love for them as it is for me, but I want to make sure everyone is compensated for their time and art. A portion of this is also going to help me feed myself, because I quit my job to make this happen, and a guy's gotta eat!</li>
<li>As a supporter, you get several perks, including early first-look demos and early access. You also get access to exclusive supporting content exploring the lore of Straukus, including digital comics, development notes and sketches, storyboards, and behind-the-scenes looks. Our most dedicated patrons get producer credits, as well as the opportunity to have a character, item, or location named for them in-game!</li>
<li>Every penny raised will go into supporting this game, or supporting my family while I work on this game. This story has been 20 years in the making, and I'm not going to stop before it is completed. However, your contributions will help it become a reality even faster, and help us reach more people than I ever could on my own.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's more important than ever that people, especially kids, are able to see themselves in the games they play, the movies they watch, and the books they read. It's no longer enough for marginalized people to remain background characters in someone else's narrative. It's time for an epic story where a character who uses sign language is treated as a valued member of the party; where a trans character isn’t a punchline; where a queer relationship is drives the story forward; where a dark-skinned woman is a primary love interest; where the displacement of indigenous peoples has real consequences. These things shouldn’t be novelties. We should be seeing more of these in games, because the “real” world we live in is diverse and beautiful.</li>
<li>The world of Straukus is a passion project for me. I love these characters, the world they inhabit, and the experiences and lore within. For me, this project is personal.</li>
<li>Although this is my first video game, this is not my first time leading a creative project. I produced, directed, and starred in a comedic web series called ""Grundy &amp; Stone"" with a team of actors and writers. I also produced and edited a short film, ""Double Felix,"" for the 48-Hour Film Project; we took the award for ""Best Graphics."" And I have collaborated with dozens of musicians on seven different studio albums.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am not a developer, and my knowledge of Javascript is limited. I'm relying on code and plug-ins created by folks more adept at those things than I am. But, I am learning quite a bit as I go, and support from experienced developers like Yanfly, Caethyril, Driftwood, and Victor Sant has been invaluable.</li>
<li>The biggest challenge is time. Creating something of this scope, especially as Rogue Star's first video game, is ambitious, and I've already spent more than a few sleepless nights with my husband wondering when I'll come to bed. It is important to get this out in a timely matter, but it's more important to get it right. That's why I'm devoting so much time to researching, writing, drawing, and thinking. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, you can still help us out by getting the word out! Share, subscribe, and tag your friends and families. Be an influencer! The work of representation is so important, and we need as many people on board as possible. Thank you so much for your help!</p>

<p> </p>
<h1>Quick Overview</h1>
<ul>
<li>Donation based (100% free)</li>
<li>Enter a world filled with powerful beings, and create your very own.</li>
<li>Choose your legacy: Loner or leader, advisor or assassin, savior or destroyer, and more.</li>
<li>An interactive story that is entirely based on prior decisions.</li>
<li>Past specific conversations, quests, and allies await you in the future.</li>
<li>Create the army of your choosing and prepare them for war against the most powerful necromancer in Areia and his army.</li>
<li>Customize your character's power set through various skill trees.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h1>The Goal</h1>
<p>Our goal is to create a role playing game that contains the realistic impacts of decisions throughout life, while still holding onto a well developed story.  We also want to set up the game in a way that makes it different every time you play it.  To accomplish this goal we have acquired the simplicity of a 2d game, and want to integrate it to have all of the greatest elements of the greatest 3d games on the market.  By doing this, we will be able to simplify the game making process and create the game in a faster, cheaper, and more refined (less glitches, unsolved issues, etc.) way.  Through this we will be able to create a unique gaming experience at an affordable price.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Story</h1>
<p>The main storyline will heavily vary based on which past you choose at the beginning of the game, and what decisions you make while playing the game.  However, the main story is:</p>
<p>After experiencing the many difficulties of your past, you have set out to become an adventurer and make a name for yourself in the Kingdom of Areia, a kingdom filled with powerful beings who each hold special abilities and legacies of their own.  Shortly after beginning your journey, you were injured and on the brink of death, but a healer named Kyla found you, and nursed you back to health.  Once you are finally healed, you decide to stay at there camp for a few more days, during which it is attacked; this is where the game begins.  The story beyond that is quickly discovered by playing the game, which you can do by downloading the demo of the game!</p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>Why Indiegogo?</h1>
<p>We have begun our campaign on Indiegogo for many reasons. The main ones being audience, assistance, and open development.  At ZZInteractive we are all about endorsing games by gamers, for gamers, and we hope that Indiegogo will help us with that.  As a company that is just beginning to stretch its wings, we want to start small and work our way up to becoming more than just indie game developers.  To do this, we need your help.  We are not asking for much, $3,000 will be just enough to get us all of the resources we need to complete the game, and will reveal whether or not there is a fan base for a decision-based 2d role playing game. Also, we want to get YOU involved with the development of the game so that we know that game is exactly the way YOU want it to be. We will reply to all questions in a timely manner, and will make sure that this game evolves into a project that YOU, as a fellow gamer, will love.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Stretch Goals</h1>
<p>Since ZZInteractive is all about making games by gamers, for gamers, we want your opinion about our stretch goals.  If an idea that is popular is not listed, we will add it, or if one currently on the list is not particularly interesting, then we will remove it!  We want you to have an opinion in the making of this game, and we want to make sure all of our players' opinions are listened to.</p>
<p><strong>4000-Companion Conversations</strong></p>
<p>The companions you add to your party will interject into your conversations to give their own opinions about your decisions and any statement or event that occurs that may relate to them or something they are interested in.</p>
<p><strong>5000-Companion History Quests</strong></p>
<p>Help or hurt your companions by helping them tie up the loose ends of the past. Make dire decisions that affect how they view you, unlock more quests, and even give special advantages that cannot be found elsewhere. Each companion will be given their own specific history quest that you may or may not choose to help them with.  The decisions you make on these quests will be crucial to preparing your team for war.</p>
<p><strong>?????-What's Next?</strong></p>
<p>Obviously we have not reached the previous stretch goals yet, however we would like to have your feedback on both our current goals and our future goals.  Please feel free to give us any suggestions you may have, so that this game can become one that is by gamers for gamers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Where does the money go?</h1>
<p>Since <strong>Legends of Areia: Destiny</strong> is a completely free game, <strong>ZZInteractive</strong> needs some sort of way to earn money to pay for all of the costs regarding the game.  There are many other costs in the making of a game including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website hosting</li>
<li>File hosting</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Programming salaries</li>
<li>Indiegogo fees</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous costs</li>
</ul><h1> </h1>
<h1>Flexible Funding</h1>
<p>ZZInteractive is commited to releasing our products to our customers.  We have been dreaming of turning ZZInteractive into a gaming company for years, and thanks to you, our wonderful backers, that can become a reality.  To fully fund this project we are asking for $3000, which is not a lot to fund a game, but if there is a lack of funding we are still commited to releasing this project.  So, if we do not raise our project's goals, we will find the money elsewhere (through friends, a campaign on a different website, a loan, selling our video game, and whatever else it takes).  However, you would then lose out on the opportunity to not only be a part of this project, but also to receive amazing rewards!</p>

ZZInteractive
 
Quick Overview

Donation based (100% free)
Enter a world filled with powerful beings, and create your very own.
Choose your legacy: Loner or leader, advisor or assassin, savior or destroyer, and more.
An interactive story that is entirely based on prior decisions.
Past specific conversations, quests, and allies await you in the future.
Create the army of your choosing and prepare them for war against the most powerful necromancer in Areia and his army.
Customize your character's power set through various skill trees.
 
The Goal
Our goal is to create a role playing game that contains the realistic impacts of decisions throughout life, while still holding onto a well developed story.  We also want to set up the game in a way that makes it different every time you play it.  To accomplish this goal we have acquired the simplicity of a 2d game, and want to integrate it to have all of the greatest elements of the greatest 3d games on the market.  By doing this, we will be able to simplify the game making process and create the game in a faster, cheaper, and more refined (less glitches, unsolved issues, etc.) way.  Through this we will be able to create a unique gaming experience at an affordable price.
 
Story
The main storyline will heavily vary based on which past you choose at the beginning of the game, and what decisions you make while playing the game.  However, the main story is:
After experiencing the many difficulties of your past, you have set out to become an adventurer and make a name for yourself in the Kingdom of Areia, a kingdom filled with powerful beings who each hold special abilities and legacies of their own.  Shortly after beginning your journey, you were injured and on the brink of death, but a healer named Kyla found you, and nursed you back to health.  Once you are finally healed, you decide to stay at there camp for a few more days, during which it is attacked; this is where the game begins.  The story beyond that is quickly discovered by playing the game, which you can do by downloading the demo of the game!
 
Legends of Areia: Destiny Demo
 
Why Indiegogo?
We have begun our campaign on Indiegogo for many reasons. The main ones being audience, assistance, and open development.  At ZZInteractive we are all about endorsing games by gamers, for gamers, and we hope that Indiegogo will help us with that.  As a company that is just beginning to stretch its wings, we want to start small and work our way up to becoming more than just indie game developers.  To do this, we need your help.  We are not asking for much, $3,000 will be just enough to get us all of the resources we need to complete the game, and will reveal whether or not there is a fan base for a decision-based 2d role playing game. Also, we want to get YOU involved with the development of the game so that we know that game is exactly the way YOU want it to be. We will reply to all questions in a timely manner, and will make sure that this game evolves into a project that YOU, as a fellow gamer, will love.
 
Stretch Goals
Since ZZInteractive is all about making games by gamers, for gamers, we want your opinion about our stretch goals.  If an idea that is popular is not listed, we will add it, or if one currently on the list is not particularly interesting, then we will remove it!  We want you to have an opinion in the making of this game, and we want to make sure all of our players' opinions are listened to.
4000-Companion Conversations
The companions you add to your party will interject into your conversations to give their own opinions about your decisions and any statement or event that occurs that may relate to them or something they are interested in.
5000-Companion History Quests
Help or hurt your companions by helping them tie up the loose ends of the past. Make dire decisions that affect how they view you, unlock more quests, and even give special advantages that cannot be found elsewhere. Each companion will be given their own specific history quest that you may or may not choose to help them with.  The decisions you make on these quests will be crucial to preparing your team for war.
?????-What's Next?
Obviously we have not reached the previous stretch goals yet, however we would like to have your feedback on both our current goals and our future goals.  Please feel free to give us any suggestions you may have, so that this game can become one that is by gamers for gamers.
 
Where does the money go?
Since Legends of Areia: Destiny is a completely free game, ZZInteractive needs some sort of way to earn money to pay for all of the costs regarding the game.  There are many other costs in the making of a game including:

Website hosting
File hosting
Testing
Marketing
Programming salaries
Indiegogo fees
Other miscellaneous costs
 
Flexible Funding
ZZInteractive is commited to releasing our products to our customers.  We have been dreaming of turning ZZInteractive into a gaming company for years, and thanks to you, our wonderful backers, that can become a reality.  To fully fund this project we are asking for $3000, which is not a lot to fund a game, but if there is a lack of funding we are still commited to releasing this project.  So, if we do not raise our project's goals, we will find the money elsewhere (through friends, a campaign on a different website, a loan, selling our video game, and whatever else it takes).  However, you would then lose out on the opportunity to not only be a part of this project, but also to receive amazing rewards!

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why IndieGoGo?<br/>
</h3> <p>IndieGoGo has a track record of funding some amazing games.  While I started working on Daath Galaxy over 5 years ago, full time work on the game has only been on-going for less than 2 years.  In that time period, I've spent a lot of time and money producing this game, but I'm nearing a point where the little cash I have left to put back into the game will become a bottleneck that will delay production.  <br/></p>
<p>No matter how this IndieGoGo campaign goes, I will finish this game and release it, but with your help I can finish it much sooner rather later.  This is because the majority of what's left to do to finish the game requires spending money.   I spend $10 a month for Mudbox, and $20 a month to host DaathGalaxy.com, so my base monthly bill is $30 just to stay afloat.  But that's not even my main concern.  Here's why I need your help with this project:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>
<b>Unity PRO</b> - Right now I'm using Unity free.  I need Unity PRO for many reasons, like Bloom, Depth of Field, automatic LOD, render to texture, and to keep my game 100% loading screen free!  I'm talking seamless level transitions.  Unity PRO costs $75 a month for a year, and I really need it to release Daath Galaxy at it's full potential.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Voice Acting</b> - $5000 - I want this game to be fully voice acted, which combined with the unique conversation system I've developed, requires thousands of audio clips and dozens of high quality voice actors to be even worth doing.  For example, early in the game an officer orders you to report to your commanding officer.  If you keep engaging him in dialog, he gets upset because you're not following your orders.  Eventually, he will throw you in the brig.  You can also attack him, pick pocket him, or anyone in the game.  This changes each character's dialog, because in real life people don't appreciate being pestered, stolen from, or assaulted, and so the dialog &amp; NPC systems in the game reflect that.  There are 12 main quests which change dynamically based on whether your character is evil, neutral, or good, resulting in deviations in the main story, with 9 possible endings.  I've also got 250 side quests, as well as dynamically generated quests.  The amount of voice acting for this content is truly a daunting task, and left to fund this on my own, it's going to take me awhile to be able to afford the right people for as much time as I need them for.  I've already lined up 2 excellent voice actors, and I can afford to piece meal work to them, but I'd really love to assemble a roster of 12 to 20 voice actors to really make this world come to life!  So that's one reason why I need your help.</li>
<li>
<b>Art Assets</b> - $10,000 - I've got about half the assets I need to begin mass production of the game world, but I need more art assets for many environments and for specific characters and races.  I've already sunk over $10,000 into 3d models &amp; assets for this game, but I don't have enough to complete all the environments, nor do I have the right custom models for several of the alien races and monsters.  While I do create a lot art assets and 3d models myself, my strong suit is definitely programming.  I've been talking with a few artist who are both amazingly talented and affordable.  Between the assets I already have, and the clear specs of what I am lacking in assets, I could definitely use your help to complete it.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Keeping This My Full Time Job</b> - $10,000 - It's been the life of a starving artist for me since I made Daath Galaxy my full time job, but I am super passionate about it, so it's been a labor of love.  However, it's not realistic for me to keep doing this full time in the short term, especially if I've got to finance the rest of the game, including the voice acting completely out of pocket.  My game requires a lot of coffee, a lot of beans &amp; rice, and a roof over my head, so with your help I can continue doing this full time so that it gets done much sooner.</li>
<li>
<b>Perks, Misc, Fees, &amp; Taxes</b> - $10,000 - Daath Galaxy will have a physical DVD release, along with a double CD soundtrack and Strategy Guide.  The more funding and pre-orders I get for this physical versions, the cheaper it is for me to produce them.  There are also several software packages I would like to buy which will increase the production value of Daath Galaxy or further streamline my production pipeline.  Finally there are IndieGoGo/PayPal fees, as well as taxes.  This final amount is to cover all these miscellaneous expenses. <br/>
</li> <li>
<b>Stretch Goals - </b>I've got a whole list of stretch goals written in my notebook, including ports to more platforms, free expansions to the game post-release, and a bunch more.  Are you interested in those stretch goals?  If so, help me get close to the original goal and I'll happily share stretch goals here in an update!<b><br/></b>
</li> <li>
<b>What If I Don't Reach My Funding Goal?</b> - I'm thankful for any funding I get, so thank you! If I don't reach the initial goal of $35,000 the game is still definitely coming out, it will just be a lot longer before it's totally finished.  Whatever funds I do raise in this case will be spread as evenly as possible between voicing acting, art assets, rent, fees, and perk fulfillment. <br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges &amp; My Qualifications<br/>
</h3> <p> Developing a video game is hard.  Developing an open world RPG game virtually by yourself is pure insanity.  That's why it's over 6 years later and I'm still working hard on this project.  I can finally see the end in sight!  However, that doesn't mean it's smooth sailing from here.  Since I am the man behind it all, if I get caught up on one task, bam! there goes my entire production timeline.  That's why the more help I can get from you, the more delegation I can use to minimize this risk.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Worst Case Scenarios</b><br/></p>
<p>That's lots of things that can go wrong when doing any sort of development, from game breaking bugs, to memory leaks, to hardware specific failures, and anything in between.  Luckily, the programming is mostly behind me at this point, and most of those development issues have been navigated through, with only moderate gnashing of teeth.<br/></p>
<p>The big concern now is populating this nearly complete engine with production quality content, and that's where I still have gaping holes in my universe.  I need those voice actors and I need those art assets before this game will ship!  <br/></p>
<p>Worse case, I make $0 from this and spend $100 here or there when I can afford it to slowly assemble the things I need.  If it drags on long enough, I downsize the voice acting or even completely remove it, but only if it becomes completely unrealistic to do it.  The art assets are not optional, but the quality I can achieve is definitely capped by my budget, so with $0 funding, the game world and characters will not look as good as they could've with the proper talent creating them.  Finally, with $0 funding, I would be forced to soon focus on my other software projects full time so that I can make money to continuing funding Daath Galaxy myself.<br/></p>
<p>So the worse case scenario is bad, but it doesn't mean the death of this game, just a long delay and potential drop in quality.</p>
<p><b>My Qualifications</b><br/></p>
<p>I'm a 32 year old father with a love for science fiction, role playing games, and computer programming. I've been making RPG games since I was 11, and have been a professional full time computer programmer for over 10 years.  I've released over 20 commercial software projects, as well 10 open source projects over the last 10 years.  <br/><br/>While I've created many games in the past using the Commodore 64, GWBASIC, QBASIC, and Delphi 7, they unfortunately pre-dated the time period where I released things on the internet.  I also lost a game engine I had written in PHP (server) &amp; HTML/Javascript/ActionScript 3 (client) due to a hard drive crash (I had sold the computer with the backup on it a week earlier &amp; literally lost years worth of work!)  <br/><br/>The only game I developed which has been preserved on the internet is a 3d Flash first person shooter that I created in 2009 using CopperCube, programmed in ActionScript 3 using FlashDevelop.  I initially programmed the game using a standard FPS camera, which was fully unlocked and controlled by the mouse, so you could look or aim anywhere by moving your mouse.  I found a sponsor for the game who paid me $500 (which paid my rent for the month) but a week after payment he said he either wanted his money back, or he wanted the controls changed to remove the mouse ability, and to instead switch to keyboard only controls to make the game feel more like Doom.  I was honestly pretty angry at this demand, but I had already paid rent and couldn't afford to refund him.  So it took a few weeks of additional work to strip out CopperCube's excellent default control scheme, and over ride it with the inferior limited keyboard movement.  The result was that an already thin game become much more difficult to play.  <br/><br/>I've went through the trouble of telling you that story, because the majority of the development time on this game was spent rewriting the controls for this guy, and I wanted to actually share my one commercial game release with you.  So without further disclaimers, here is Zombie Rapture 3d:<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/521276"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/521276</a><br/><br/>Not that great, but remember this was a Flash game in 2009, so hopefully that puts it into context.<br/><br/>I first fell in love with role playing games when I was 8 years old.  In the winter of 1990, my mom bought me a subscription to Nintendo Power magazine that came with the NES cart Dragon Warrior.  I was always pretty good at video games, and still am today, but I struggled with Dragon Warrior early, so that by the first time I defeated the Dragon Lord I felt accomplished.  Ever since then, I've been an RPG addict.  <br/><br/>In middle school, my notebooks would be occupied with my own pen and paper RPG games.  These evolved over time to consist of ""choose your own adventure"" type narratives that would provide quests, and that were augmented with RPG style game play, such as a player sheet, hit points, experience &amp; leveling, items, shops, dialog options and dice battles.  <br/><br/>In the 90's, as a teenager I would often shop at thrift stores to buy old computers.  I was a nerd who was so happy to buy hardware that I had missed in 80's.  Aside from playing games on these old computers, I also starting teaching myself how to program with them.  Of course, the only reason I wanted to learn programming at 13 was to create games.  And so I wrote several computer games on outdated hardware, starting with BASIC on the Commodore 64, and GWBASIC on my monochrome 8086 with 640k RAM.  My early games were usually space shooters, the first had game play similar to Galaga, the next space shooter was in QBASIC, and played more like 1942 in space. In my early 20's I started a 3rd space shooter, combining both styles in Delphi 7.  <br/><br/>Daath Galaxy was first conceived in 2008, and early tech prototypes were made then.  The project was put on hiatus as I focused on writing Wordpress plugins and themes for several years, but I still put some part time work into it during this period.  Full time work on Daath Galaxy resumed in February 2013, and it has been in constant full time development since then.  <br/></p>
<p>I started rewriting Daath Galaxy in 2013 the same way I created RPGs as a kid in middle school.  I bought a blank notebook, and I started writing my ideas out into tables, sketches, and story arcs.  It is a labor of love, and it's progressed much faster than I could have dreamed, but regardless, this game will definitely see the light of day, and hopefully with your help that day will be soon!</p>
<p><br/></p> <ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't help fund this project today, I totally understand, but if you like it enough and want to help out, I'd definitely appreciate it!  First, please vote for Daath Galaxy on Steam so that I can get this game on the Steam service:  <br/></p>

Unity PRO - Right now I'm using Unity free.  I need Unity PRO for many reasons, like Bloom, Depth of Field, automatic LOD, render to texture, and to keep my game 100% loading screen free!  I'm talking seamless level transitions.  Unity PRO costs $75 a month for a year, and I really need it to release Daath Galaxy at it's full potential.

Perks, Misc, Fees, & Taxes - $10,000 - Daath Galaxy will have a physical DVD release, along with a double CD soundtrack and Strategy Guide.  The more funding and pre-orders I get for this physical versions, the cheaper it is for me to produce them.  There are also several software packages I would like to buy which will increase the production value of Daath Galaxy or further streamline my production pipeline.  Finally there are IndieGoGo/PayPal fees, as well as taxes.  This final amount is to cover all these miscellaneous expenses. 
 
Stretch Goals - I've got a whole list of stretch goals written in my notebook, including ports to more platforms, free expansions to the game post-release, and a bunch more.  Are you interested in those stretch goals?  If so, help me get close to the original goal and I'll happily share stretch goals here in an update!
 
What If I Don't Reach My Funding Goal? - I'm thankful for any funding I get, so thank you!

  Risks & Challenges & My Qualifications
  Developing a video game is hard.  Developing an open world RPG game virtually by yourself is pure insanity.  That's why it's over 6 years later and I'm still working hard on this project.  I can finally see the end in sight!  However, that doesn't mean it's smooth sailing from here.  Since I am the man behind it all, if I get caught up on one task, bam! there goes my entire production timeline.  That's why the more help I can get from you, the more delegation I can use to minimize this risk.  
Worst Case Scenarios
That's lots of things that can go wrong when doing any sort of development, from game breaking bugs, to memory leaks, to hardware specific failures, and anything in between.  Luckily, the programming is mostly behind me at this point, and most of those development issues have been navigated through, with only moderate gnashing of teeth.
The big concern now is populating this nearly complete engine with production quality content, and that's where I still have gaping holes in my universe.  I need those voice actors and I need those art assets before this game will ship!  
Worse case, I make $0 from this and spend $100 here or there when I can afford it to slowly assemble the things I need.  If it drags on long enough, I downsize the voice acting or even completely remove it, but only if it becomes completely unrealistic to do it.  The art assets are not optional, but the quality I can achieve is definitely capped by my budget, so with $0 funding, the game world and characters will not look as good as they could've with the proper talent creating them.  Finally, with $0 funding, I would be forced to soon focus on my other software projects full time so that I can make money to continuing funding Daath Galaxy myself.
So the worse case scenario is bad, but it doesn't mean the death of this game, just a long delay and potential drop in quality.
My Qualifications
I'm a 32 year old father with a love for science fiction, role playing games, and computer programming. I've been making RPG games since I was 11, and have been a professional full time computer programmer for over 10 years.  I've released over 20 commercial software projects, as well 10 open source projects over the last 10 years.  While I've created many games in the past using the Commodore 64, GWBASIC, QBASIC, and Delphi 7, they unfortunately pre-dated the time period where I released things on the internet.  I also lost a game engine I had written in PHP (server) & HTML/Javascript/ActionScript 3 (client) due to a hard drive crash (I had sold the computer with the backup on it a week earlier & literally lost years worth of work!)  The only game I developed which has been preserved on the internet is a 3d Flash first person shooter that I created in 2009 using CopperCube, programmed in ActionScript 3 using FlashDevelop.  I initially programmed the game using a standard FPS camera, which was fully unlocked and controlled by the mouse, so you could look or aim anywhere by moving your mouse.  I found a sponsor for the game who paid me $500 (which paid my rent for the month) but a week after payment he said he either wanted his money back, or he wanted the controls changed to remove the mouse ability, and to instead switch to keyboard only controls to make the game feel more like Doom.  I was honestly pretty angry at this demand, but I had already paid rent and couldn't afford to refund him.  So it took a few weeks of additional work to strip out CopperCube's excellent default control scheme, and over ride it with the inferior limited keyboard movement.  The result was that an already thin game become much more difficult to play.  I've went through the trouble of telling you that story, because the majority of the development time on this game was spent rewriting the controls for this guy, and I wanted to actually share my one commercial game release with you.  So without further disclaimers, here is Zombie Rapture 3d:http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/521276Not that great, but remember this was a Flash game in 2009, so hopefully that puts it into context.I first fell in love with role playing games when I was 8 years old.  In the winter of 1990, my mom bought me a subscription to Nintendo Power magazine that came with the NES cart Dragon Warrior.  I was always pretty good at video games, and still am today, but I struggled with Dragon Warrior early, so that by the first time I defeated the Dragon Lord I felt accomplished.  Ever since then, I've been an RPG addict.  In middle school, my notebooks would be occupied with my own pen and paper RPG games.  These evolved over time to consist of ""choose your own adventure"" type narratives that would provide quests, and that were augmented with RPG style game play, such as a player sheet, hit points, experience & leveling, items, shops, dialog options and dice battles.  In the 90's, as a teenager I would often shop at thrift stores to buy old computers.  I was a nerd who was so happy to buy hardware that I had missed in 80's.  Aside from playing games on these old computers, I also starting teaching myself how to program with them.  Of course, the only reason I wanted to learn programming at 13 was to create games.  And so I wrote several computer games on outdated hardware, starting with BASIC on the Commodore 64, and GWBASIC on my monochrome 8086 with 640k RAM.  My early games were usually space shooters, the first had game play similar to Galaga, the next space shooter was in QBASIC, and played more like 1942 in space. In my early 20's I started a 3rd space shooter, combining both styles in Delphi 7.  Daath Galaxy was first conceived in 2008, and early tech prototypes were made then.  The project was put on hiatus as I focused on writing Wordpress plugins and themes for several years, but I still put some part time work into it during this period.  Full time work on Daath Galaxy resumed in February 2013, and it has been in constant full time development since then.  
I started rewriting Daath Galaxy in 2013 the same way I created RPGs as a kid in middle school.  I bought a blank notebook, and I started writing my ideas out into tables, sketches, and story arcs.  It is a labor of love, and it's progressed much faster than I could have dreamed, but regardless, this game will definitely see the light of day, and hopefully with your help that day will be soon!
 
  Other Ways You Can Help If you can't help fund this project today, I totally understand, but if you like it enough and want to help out, I'd definitely appreciate it!  First, please vote for Daath Galaxy on Steam so that I can get this game on the Steam service:

<p></p>
<p>The stars in the night sky have always fascinated human
beings, often evoking a sense of awe and wonder. Being curious and pattern
seeking, we built many images (<i>constellations</i>) and stories around them
that form an integral part of our culture and folklore. Over the last two centuries, we have
learnt to carefully observe the motion of these stars in the night sky and
express them in the language of mathematics, giving birth to the first science,
<i>astronomy</i>. The last four centuries have seen great strides in
the fields of math and science, that now form the central core of our
civilization. The important milestones in our understanding of these subjects
can be marked through certain <i>mathematical constants</i> that ubiquitously
appear in the description of their laws.</p>
<p>Here we collect and bring forth many of these important <i>astronomical constellations</i> and <i>mathematical constants</i> in an appealing and engaging manner through two deck of playing cards called <b>Star Stack</b> and <b>Math Stack </b>respectively. We collectively put these stacks under a single banner called the <b>EduStack</b>, as part of our
ongoing effort to introduce new tools to reinvigorate education through games. <br/></p>

What are we about?
""The Axiom I's
main purpose is to revisit the style of old, but produce something new in the
process and not just run old games. What if game studios back then had access
to today's communication infrastructure (E.g. The Internet)? What if there
weren't such strict memory limitations?"" - David Harrison, Primary Coder/Hardware Architect
 
The 'Axiom I' is a Modern-Retro video game console; it combines modern
computing technology with the nostalgic style of 8 and 16-bit games. Within
just 6 months, we have taken this concept and begun developing a prototype of
the console. This is where we need your help; After the OS has been developed,
we will need funding to help develop the hardware further and to aid in games
development.
 
Our progress can be monitored on our blog:
 
Reminiscent Interactive 
 
List of Features:



32-Bit
Main Processor – 3 times the power of a SNES!

 8 and 16

What the project brings to the Gaming Industry:
We have two goals
with this project:
  
1. To develop a
modern-retro console, which combines elements of modern gaming (such as
internet access, achievements and downloadable content) with the nostalgia of 8
and 16-bit Gaming. 
 
2. To develop
games alongside other Independent Game Studios; not for profit, but to help
expand and improve the game development industry.
 
""We will allow Indie developers to have complete freedom when it
comes down to Intellectual Property control, marketing, distribution through
other platforms and so on. In essence, we're creating a foothold in the gaming
industry that allows small Indie companies with good ideas to actually have a
go at developing - For free."" - James
Booth, Manager of 'Reminiscent Interactive'
 
What We Need & What You Get:
To finish Console Development and begin Games Production, we need to set
up a working space; this will include an area for computers and for testing any
hardware. We have estimated that production of games shall begin in March,
coinciding with the Console OS being in beta testing. We plan to have the
console ready for distribution in 2013 (with multiple release titles). 
 
By contributing, you shall be rewarded with the perks
listed to the side; the team will also be answering any questions in the comments section and

Ways You Can Help (Besides funding us!):
Even if you can't afford to contribute, please spread the word! We're
dead set on getting this project completed and we can only do that with your
help. Whilst we have estimated that $15,000 should cover what we need, any extra donations will be put straight back into console development.

made a quick and dirty handheld console over a week end. Since then, a lot of

a challenge. That’s why I’ve been developing Gamebuino: a turnkey solution to
start making your own 8-bit games right away, even with very little knowledge
about programming. And if you are an advanced user, I have made it open-source, hackable and expandable.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<p> </p>
<h2><img alt=""Who We Are"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://arcadeodyssey.com/images/igg/IGG_1.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Who We Are""/></h2>
<p><strong>Arcade Odyssey</strong> is a true retro arcade located in Miami FL. We have been voted the #1 Arcade in South Florida by several organizations. Originally we had planned to open a Video Game Museum &amp; Arcade but unfortunately we were unable to make our vision a reality. But as anyone who has ever played a video game will tell you, we gamers can be very stubborn, so we decided to move ahead with the Arcade portion and add the museum at a later date.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide everyone with the best possible gaming experience anywhere; we accomplish this by circulating rare and unique titles every month, taking recommendations/requests from you our customers, offering console gaming tournaments and cosplay competitions on a monthly basis, as well as Asian drinks and snacks to add the overall experience.</p>
<p>Always striving to surpass our limits, we now we feel it’s time to take our vision of a gaming utopia to the next level.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><img alt=""What We Plan To Create"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://arcadeodyssey.com/images/igg/IGG_2.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""What We Plan To Create""/></h2>
<p>Imagine a place where you can take a trip back in time and learn about the history of gaming including consoles, computers and handhelds from around the world.</p>
<p>An Arcade with over 200 games, from the latest and greatest, including rare and imported titles, pinballs, and of course the classics.</p>
<p>Console/PC Gaming rooms with high speed networking and broadcasting capabilities to be used for tournament events; these are to be held on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>A place where blossoming game developers can have actual gamers test their works in progress, and get feedback from the players.</p>

<p>We know that the amount required to create this magnificent place is staggering, but with great progress comes great risk. So we created a flexible-funding campaign just in case we don’t meet our goal. We would use the funds to purchase additional games for our current location and/or the possibility of expansion to a new venue.  Some of the games we will be trying to acquire include:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Phase One - $150,000</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the existing Arcade we will acquire a separate larger location around 3,000sqft, which will encompass a new larger tournament area for consoles, card and tabletop gaming. Additionally there will be more Arcade and Pinball machines located on site.</p>
<p>These funds will cover the basic build out, A/C units, electrical work, tables, chairs, consoles and additional Arcade and Pinball machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Phase Two - $350,000</strong></h3>
<p>Everything from Phase One plus a new counter within the Arcade for selling Bubble Tea &amp; additional snacks. We also are able to acquire new cabinets and a large portion of our new game acquisition including the following titles:</p>
<p>• Initial D 7XAA – Double Cabinet<br/> • DDR X3 or 2013<br/> • Castlevania: The Arcade<br/> • Metal Gear Solid Arcade 3D – 4 Units<br/> • Miku Hatsune: Project Diva<br/> • Sonic Blast Heroes<br/> • The Bishi Bashi<br/> • Wizard of Oz Pinball<br/> • House of the Dead 4 EX<br/> • Wangan Midnight 4 – Double Cabinet<br/> • Pac-man Battle Royale<br/> • Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus R<br/> • Darius Burst: Another Chronicle EX<br/> • Taito No Tatsujin #14</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>Phase Three</strong><strong> - $750,000</strong>
</h3>
<p>In addition to Phase One &amp; Two we would acquire an addition 3,000sqft to build out a smaller Museum. This would allow us to build all the fixtures, furniture and walls. As well as the equipment necessary to make it a true interactive experience such as interfaces and screens.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Phase Four - $1,500,000</strong></h3>
<p>This would allow us to do everything mentioned above plus make additions to the annex and lease another 1,000sqft of retail space. In the new storefront we would offer a Comic Book Store &amp; Retro Console section to buy, sell and trade and even repair systems. This would allow us to fully stock the store with card games, tabletops, comics, furniture, comics and merchandise.<br/><br/> We would also be able to purchase 20 custom built PCs to host additional tournaments in the annex.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Phase Five - $3,000,000</strong></h3>
<p>This would allow us to purchase a 10,000sqft location to house everything under one roof. This location would encompass everything mentioned above plus a full sized museum.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Phase Six - $5,000,000</strong></h3>
<p>This would allow us to purchase a 25,000sqft location to house everything under one roof. This location would encompass everything mentioned above plus themed rooms for tabletop games, stages with karaoke, projector and sound systems. Tournament area would see a significant increase in size.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Phase Seven - $7,000,000</strong></h3>
<p>The true vision! Everything under one large 50,000sqft location that we will own. Everything mentioned in the above phases plus a video game themed restaurant and full liquor bar. <br/><br/> This covers the cost of permits, freezers, fridges, grills, full staff, all necessary renovations, electrical, zoning, flooring, exterior and A/C equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Who is Rick Medina and what is the reason for wanting to create something so astronomical?</strong><br/><br/>A. Many know Rick Medina as the owner of Arcade Odyssey. But very few know him as one of the largest collectors of video game consoles in the world. He has amassed almost 300 unique consoles, over 75 Arcade Cabinets and Pinball machines and 300+ Arcade boards over the course of 25 years. </p>

So most of the contents of the Museum and Arcade are already privately owned?</strong><br/><br/>A. Yes. Since a large portion of it is already owned we are not looking to acquire hundreds of machines to create this place. All contributions will go towards the construction.<br/><br/><strong>Q. Why $7 Million?</strong><br/><br/>A. Many arcades within the last 5 years have closed their doors due to landlord issues and/or property lease disputes. We want to avoid that in advance. So the money will go towards the building acquisition and any renovations the new location will require.

<h3><strong>Every little bit helps, please share in our efforts to make this dream a reality.<br/></strong></h3></div>","Join us as we attempt to create the ultimate gamers paradise, encompasing everything from an Interactive Video Game Museum, Arcade, Pinballs, Consoles, PCs, Card & Tabletop Games.
 

Arcade Odyssey is a true retro arcade located in Miami FL. We have been voted the #1 Arcade in South Florida by several organizations. Originally we had planned to open a Video Game Museum & Arcade but unfortunately we were unable to make our vision a reality. But as anyone who has ever played a video game will tell you, we gamers can be very stubborn, so we decided to move ahead with the Arcade portion and add the museum at a later date.
Our aim is to provide everyone with the best possible gaming experience anywhere; we accomplish this by circulating rare and unique titles every month, taking recommendations/requests from you our customers, offering console gaming tournaments and cosplay competitions on a monthly basis, as well as Asian drinks and snacks to add the overall experience.
Always striving to surpass our limits, we now we feel it’s time to take our vision of a gaming utopia to the next level.
 

Imagine a place where you can take a trip back in time and learn about the history of gaming including consoles, computers and handhelds from around the world.
An Arcade with over 200 games, from the latest and greatest, including rare and imported titles, pinballs, and of course the classics.
Console/PC Gaming rooms with high speed networking and broadcasting capabilities to be used for tournament events; these are to be held on a weekly basis.
A place where blossoming game developers can have actual gamers test their works in progress, and get feedback from the players.
We would also encompass a comic book store with the latest issues, collectables and manga magazines.
Dedicated themed table top rooms, where gamers can congregate and play every game from Magic the Gathering and Pokémon to War-hammer and Dungeons & Dragons.
Retrogaming rooms with buying, selling and trading games, full parts and repair services available.
Bubble tea and frozen custard, a video game themed restaurant with a full liquor bar.
A dance floor, karaoke stages with Professional Rock Band Setups and 10ft projector screens.
Live Music from local bands, stunning Laser Light shows
All this under one roof!

<p>The team needs to reach <strong>$1,500 </strong>in order to get the development of the game in full gear.</p>
<p>With this budget, the team can hire an awesome composer for the game's Original Soundtrack, talented voice actors to make the characters come alive, and creative writers to help flesh out  the game's story even more.</p>
<p><br/>In exchange, the team offers you one-of-a-kind rewards ranging from having your name as one of the game's recurring baddies up to having you design your own playable character, boss, or even an entire level!</p>
<p><br/>If in case the project doesn't reach its target funding, don't fret!</p>
<p>We'll at least be able to utilize it (with the help of other potential external funding sources) to hire a composer at most -- with most of the characters' names being based on the rock and metal music genre, Combatron needs his game to have an all-original soundtrack, after all!</p>

<p>Combatron: Project Phoenix will make history because it is the very first Filipino-made video game that is based on an existing and popular comicbook character. Therefore, you, the backer, will be part of the people who can proudly say that you helped in making this happen.</p>
<p>Caotic Pixel Studios' team lead, JC Malapit, is a veteran in the local game development industry. He started his career as a game designer (the one who conceptualizes characters, stories, gameplay,etc) for Anino Games - the pioneer game development company in the Philippines, on late 2006. But before that, he was already an accomplished game developer who created games as a hobby in as early as 2001. </p>
<p>After Anino Games, he has worked for several game development companies in the Philippines until around five years ago when he decided to work as a freelance animator. This in turn gave him more time to hone his skills even more; and he started developing games intended for commercial purposes (including this one) on his own. He is capable of producing game art, animation, programming, special effects, and virtually any aspects of the whole game development process. Along with the help of the rest of the team, this project is in good hands.</p>

<p>First and foremost, the main challenge in the development of this project is the potential lack of manpower just in case the project goes big. Due to the popularity of the main character, Combatron, the game will definitely be played by thousands (or more) fans and therefore they will need to be provided with an unforgettable experience. In order to do this, the game might need to have a larger scope in every aspect. With that said, the team is ready to make arrangements with additional talents to help with the development. </p>
<p><br/>Moreover, if in case the campaign doesn't reach the target funding, the team might not be able to afford a composer. But, the team is ready to find other potential source of funding as well as making arrangements with a composer and come up with an agreement that will benefit both parties.</p>

Game too hard? No problem! Collect enough ""Embers"" to revive on the spot!
Use Embers to upgrade the heroes' combos and stats, too!
It's not all Beat 'Em Up, some levels are also Shoot 'Em Ups!

 



The team needs to reach $1,500 in order to get the development of the game in full gear.
With this budget, the team can hire an awesome composer for the game's Original Soundtrack, talented voice actors to make the characters come alive, and creative writers to help flesh out  the game's story even more.
In exchange, the team offers you one-of-a-kind rewards ranging from having your name as one of the game's recurring baddies up to having you design your own playable character, boss, or even an entire level!
If in case the project doesn't reach its target funding, don't fret!
We'll at least be able to utilize it (with the help of other potential external funding sources) to hire a composer at most -- with most of the characters' names being based on the rock and metal music genre, Combatron needs his game to have an all-original soundtrack, after all!
 



Combatron: Project Phoenix will make history because it is the very first Filipino-made video game that is based on an existing and popular comicbook character. Therefore, you, the backer, will be part of the people who can proudly say that you helped in making this happen.
Caotic Pixel Studios' team lead, JC Malapit, is a veteran in the local game development industry. He started his career as a game designer (the one who conceptualizes characters, stories, gameplay,etc) for Anino Games - the pioneer game development company in the Philippines, on late 2006. But before that, he was already an accomplished game developer who created games as a hobby in as early as 2001. 
After Anino Games, he has worked for several game development companies in the Philippines until around five years ago when he decided to work as a freelance animator. This in turn gave him more time to hone his skills even more; and he started developing games intended for commercial purposes (including this one) on his own. He is capable of producing game art, animation, programming, special effects, and virtually any aspects of the whole game development process. Along with the help of the rest of the team, this project is in good hands.
 



First and foremost, the main challenge in the development of this project is the potential lack of manpower just in case the project goes big. Due to the popularity of the main character, Combatron, the game will definitely be played by thousands (or more) fans and therefore they will need to be provided with an unforgettable experience. In order to do this, the game might need to have a larger scope in every aspect. With that said, the team is ready to make arrangements with additional talents to help with the development. 
Moreover, if in case the campaign doesn't reach the target funding, the team might not be able to afford a composer. But, the team is ready to find other potential source of funding as well as making arrangements with a composer and come up with an agreement that will benefit both parties.
 



If in case you are not able to fund the project due to various reasons, it's okay!
All the team asks is that you share this crowdfunding campaign to as many people as possible.

<h1 style=""color: black;"">Said about Factorio</h1>
<p><em><em><strong> ... I have been unable to stop playing. 30+ hours so far</strong> - </em></em>bill, Factorio Forums</p>
<p><em><strong>Dang it, now I'm hooked on this game.</strong>- </em>Sacheverell, Content Manager for the official Minecraft Forum</p>
<p><em><strong>Great game, can't believe this is an alpha. Excited for the full release.</strong> - </em>rymn<em>,</em> FacePunch Forums</p>
<p><strong><em>This looks pretty cool. Factorio, indie game where you make factories on other worlds. Hope it succeeds :)</em> </strong>- Nathan Adams, Minecraft Developer</p>
<p><strong><em>I loved your game as I did not love any game ever. (As a gamer with 15 years of experience)</em></strong> - Mindreader, Factorio Forums</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>We are geeks and we like to build stuff. We have spent a significant portion of our childhood and youth messing with lego, programming and playing games like Transport Tycoon, Civilization or Simcity. Games which didn't have impressive graphics, but still were a lot of fun to play. They were all about designing, building and creating things. About figuiring out how to solve little puzzles (Hmm how do I extend this train station?) and about managing what you created (Arrgh i need to upgrade all these roads into railroads!). We loved these games and we spent many nights staying up and playing them. </p>
<p>Then there came the idea for a game where you build your factory. You wouldn't have slaves or drones to give orders to. You would have to setup everything yourself. Automate a lot and make sure that things will scale up well. What if you found yourselve on a deserted place or maybe an alien planet alone with no equipment. Would you be able to survive? Would you be able to start from the scratch and build your tools and machines from the ground up? </p>
<h1>Game</h1>
<p>Factorio is a 2D game about building factories on an alien planet. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure and fighting alien enemies. Use your imagination to design your factory, apply management skills to keep it working and finally show your close combat skills in encounters with planet inhabitants who don't really like you.</p>
<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>A public demo is already available. No signup, no fee, just download it from <a href=""http://www.factorio.com/demo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.factorio.com/demo</a> and play it now:) The demo contains a short 3-level introductory campaign. There is a very limited set of concepts and game elements in the demo compared to what will be in the full game and what is currently in the alpha. Main purpose of the demo is to give general feeling for the game and allow players to test whether the game works well with their specific system.</p>
<h3>Alpha</h3>
<p>The game will be released in its current state as an alpha in mid March 2013. The alpha will be available to all backers. The alpha is already playable and contains following things (however not graphically finished or polished):</p>
<ul>
<li>2 extra campaign levels in three difficulty settings</li>
<li>singleplayer freeplay (couple of hours playing on a procedurally generated map)</li>
<li>researching technologies for unlocking recipes or improving existing structures</li>
<li>programmable signals to get fine grain control over your factory</li>
<li>logistic robots to ease transportation in big factories</li>
<li>more game content
<ul>
<li>assembling machines to automatically craft things</li>
<li>transport belts to ground to allow belts crossing</li>
<li>filtering inserters</li>
<li>laboratories to perform research</li>
<li>steel processing</li>
<li>entities variations (chests, inserters, etc.)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>more weapons (flamethrower, rocket launcher, landmines)</li>
<li>map editor</li>
<li>lua scenarios scripting</li>
<li>moderate modding support (all game element properties are defined as data)</li>
</ul><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogo-factorio-com.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshot-3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Release</h3>
<p>If we get the funding, the expected release date will be May 2013. The release will feature (on top of the alpha):</p>
<ul>
<li>longer main campaign</li>
<li>overall tuning and polishing (singleplayer freeplay, map editor, etc.)</li>
<li>finished graphics (including better GUI :))</li>
<li>richer technology tree (e.g. way more modifiers - speed, energy efficiency, health)</li>
<li>more game content
<ul>
<li>accumulators to store energy</li>
<li>rocket towers</li>
<li>larger iron furnace</li>
<li>transport belt recombinators</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>better combat mechanics
<ul>
<li>batteries to enable special attack effects (slow enemies, ...)</li>
<li>splash damage attacks</li>
<li>armor varieties</li>
<li>little robots flying around the character and protecting him</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>variety of enemy creatures</li>
<li>technical stuff (automatic downloader / updater, speed improvements)</li>
</ul><p>The game is written in C++ and will be available for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux (atm just Ubuntu). Distribution will be digital only. You pay once and that is it. All future updates are included. No P2W, no DRM, no surprises.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogo-factorio-com.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshot-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Funding</h1>
<p>Up to now we have financed the game development ourselves. We hired freelancers to work on 2d, 3d and concept graphics as well as on sound design. This allowed us to release a demo and get the game into early alpha state. However to finish the level game we need extra funds. Namely for:</p>
<p><strong>Improving game graphics</strong> It is painfully obvious that a large part of the graphical content in the game is still conceptual (mining drills, turrets, boilers, vehicle etc.). Getting the funds will allow us to create reasonable graphical looks for all the elements currently in the game as well as for the elements we plan for the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Continuing full time development </strong>Without the funding we won't be able to focus solely on the game and continue at the fast pace we have progressed in the past months.</p>
<p>The funding we have chosen is Fixed Funding. That means if we don't reach our goal we get nothing and all the backers will get their money back. This is because we believe that amount we are targetting is the minimum that is necessary for us to finish the game. </p>
<p>In case we don't get the funding we stop the full time development and go back to programming jobs. One of the following will happen to the game:</p>
<ul>
<li> finished in our spare time (will take significantly longer)</li>
<li> released in the current state as an open source</li>
<li> abandoned:(</li>
</ul><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogo-factorio-com.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshot-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Stretch goals</h1>
<p>We have a lot of ideas for further development. We have composed a list of couple of stretch goals in the order we thing makes the most sense. However, as mentioned earlier, we think players should have a say in what will go in or not. Therefore the final ordering in the list below will be decided in player polls on the website.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer </strong>We are mainly aiming for a cooperative multiplayer, where players build the factory together. They can divide tasks, speed up the factory bootstrap, attack from more directions, etc. We believe this will bring the game to a completely new level.</p>
<p><strong>Railroads </strong>Will allow you to transport large chunks of resources / produced goods around in your factory or from one factory into another. Together with transport belts and logistic robots this will allow you to create more efficient logistic setups.  This is necessary and currently lacking in later stages of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Blueprints </strong>Blueprints are mechanism to avoid repetitive building of the same structures again and again. They will allow the player to ""copy"" existing set of structures (part of the factory) and use it as a blueprint somewhere else.  </p>
<p><strong>Alternative energy </strong>Build solar plants and get cheap energy during the day. Setup wind mills in  windy areas to diversify your energy production. Experiment with fusion reactors.</p>
<p><strong>Modifiers </strong>You will get a choice of the player with a different skillset in the beginning. This will result in bonuses for fight, mining, effectivity of machines, energy production, etc. There will also be in game achievements that will unlock bonuses like this (for example processing this and this much of iron in this time will increase mining effectivity). We believe this concept will add a lot of depth to the game.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden ores </strong>At the moment all the mining is done from sources on the surface of the planet. However the true treasures are hidden deep in the ground. First you will have to locate them by scanning and only after that use elaborate mining machines to get them.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogo-factorio-com.s3.amazonaws.com/stretch-goals.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Team</h1>
<p>We are two programmers from Prague, Czech Republic (that is a small country in the middle of Europe). We have experiences across multiple fields of software engineering. Factorio was born from a hobby project and resulted in two of us working on the project full time for close to a year. We have spent a lot of time playing computer games and we want Factorio to be the game which we will enjoy playing. Actually we have played Factorio a LOT so far and still enjoy doing so.</p>
<h1>Rewards</h1>
<p><strong>Game access</strong> Every backer will get a digital key for game download. This includes all the updates in the future as long as the development continues. On top of that every backer will get access to the alpha release (March 2013).</p>
<p><strong>Development polls</strong> We would like the players to have a say in where the game is heading. We decided to implement this with a concept we call dev polls. There will be regular polls on the web page about further development directions and game improvements. Every backer gets a number of votes depending on how much he contributed.</p>
<p><strong>Digital wallpapers </strong>Our artist made a set of three digital wallpapers specifically for the crowdfunding campaign. Apart from being really pretty they tell a story of the game as well: landing - setting up industrialization - fighting the enemies</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogo-factorio-com.s3.amazonaws.com/theme-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogo-factorio-com.s3.amazonaws.com/theme-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogo-factorio-com.s3.amazonaws.com/theme-3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Scenario packs </strong>Besides freeplay which is one long game, the reward tiers will contain additional challenging scenarios which will test different player abilities. Some examples of scenarios in the pack are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mining challenge: In fixed time mine as much as possible.</li>
<li>Effectivity king: Produce predefines set of items with least resources in shortest time.       </li>
<li>Tower defense: Protect your base for a given time from hoards of attacking aliens.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Name in the Game </strong>Many entities in the game will have a name of the model that will be generated from names list. For instance when seeing an info for particular inserter you will see that this is ""John Smith"" model. </p>
<p><strong>Name in the Credits </strong>There will be a section with the credits to people who contributed larger amount. We would like something better and more innovative than a simple list of names. However we don't know yet what it will be. </p>
<p><strong>Chat with the developer(s) </strong>Are you curious about some particular details regarding the project ? Would you like to ask for strategy tips and tricks guys who wrote the game? Or maybe you would like to do something completely different - like play <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""game of Go"">a game of Go</a>. Whichever you like for 1 - 2 hours. Can be done over a glass of good beer in Prague or over the Internet. </p></div>","The campaign is over. We have managed to get the funds needed. Big thanks to all our backers!

This will result in bonuses for fight, mining, effectivity of machines, energy production, etc. There will also be in game achievements that will unlock bonuses like this (for example processing this and this much of iron in this time will increase mining effectivity). We believe this concept will add a lot of depth to the game.
Hidden ores At the moment all the mining is done from sources on the surface of the planet. However the true treasures are hidden deep in the ground. First you will have to locate them by scanning and only after that use elaborate mining machines to get them.

Team
We are two programmers from Prague, Czech Republic (that is a small country in the middle of Europe). We have experiences across multiple fields of software engineering. Factorio was born from a hobby project and resulted in two of us working on the project full time for close to a year. We have spent a lot of time playing computer games and we want Factorio to be the game which we will enjoy playing. Actually we have played Factorio a LOT so far and still enjoy doing so.
Rewards
Game access Every backer will get a digital key for game download. This includes all the updates in the future as long as the development continues. On top of that every backer will get access to the alpha release (March 2013).
Development polls We would like the players to have a say in where the game is heading. We decided to implement this with a concept we call dev polls. There will be regular polls on the web page about further development directions and game improvements. Every backer gets a number of votes depending on how much he contributed.
Digital wallpapers Our artist made a set of three digital wallpapers specifically for the crowdfunding campaign. Apart from being really pretty they tell a story of the game as well: landing - setting up industrialization - fighting the enemies

Scenario packs Besides freeplay which is one long game, the reward tiers will contain additional challenging scenarios which will test different player abilities. Some examples of scenarios in the pack are:

Mining challenge: In fixed time mine as much as possible.
Effectivity king: Produce predefines set of items with least resources in shortest time.       
Tower defense: Protect your base for a given time from hoards of attacking aliens.
Name in the Game Many entities in the game will have a name of the model that will be generated from names list. For instance when seeing an info for particular inserter you will see that this is ""John Smith"" model. 
Name in the Credits There will be a section with the credits to people who contributed larger amount. We would like something better and more innovative than a simple list of names. However we don't know yet what it will be. 
Chat with the developer(s) Are you curious about some particular details regarding the project ? Would you like to ask for strategy tips and tricks guys who wrote the game? Or maybe you would like to do something completely different - like play a game of Go. Whichever you like for 1 - 2 hours. Can be done over a glass of good beer in Prague or over the Internet.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Update : Everything We Forgot To Mention In Our Video...</h3>
<h3><img alt=""IndieGoGo logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.evilegg.co.uk/roots/13/images/indiegogo_logo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>G'day!</h3>
<p>we're EvilEgg and we're here at IndieGoGo to ask for your support.  We're a very small team of development professionals, collaborating together outside of working hours to become a fully fledged software house, producing <em>quality </em>apps and games.</p>
<p>We are asking for help in funding our current project, a physics game called Pong Shots.  Initially available for iPhone and iPad, Pong Shots will eventually be multi-platform and released for the Android OS.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is Pong Shots?</h3>
<p><img alt=""Pong Shots Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.evilegg.co.uk/roots/13/images/indiegogo_pongshots_logo.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;""/>Pong Shots is our flagship title, and one that we expect will put our name in lights.  Pong Shots is a 2D physics game with a beautifully simple concept - flick a ball, land it in a cup.  You score points based on the various surfaces you bounce off, so while some surfaces boost your score, others will slash it.  This simple gameplay element adds a whole dimension to what is already an incredibly fun and addictive concept.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why do we need funding?</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we're a small team - a <em>very</em> small team - We are working as hard as we can on Pong Shots outside of daily working hours, and funding will enable us to ramp up production and finish our game much quicker by outsourcing tasks to external talent, and/or by utilising assets that are readily available to purchase.</p>
<p>As well as releasing the game quicker, we will also use your contribution to market Pong Shots effectively though various tried and tested channels such as Google AdWords and social media ads.</p>
<p>Finally, we will be able to purchase licences for better software which will open many doors for additional functionality in our game(s).  We're currently using free software from Unity3D but the drawback is limited functionality that we can unlock with a PRO Licence.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How can we ever thank you enough?</h3>
<p>When you contribute to our project, you're not just funding the development of one game, but paving the way for Evil Egg's future as a serious software house, and for that we consider all contributors to be our friends.  Duncan and I would like to eventually thank every contributor in person.  Following the launch of Pong Shots we will attend major trade shows and conventions, with the goal of hosting our own events for our friends (that's you) to attend.</p>
<p>Immediately, we're able to thank you with a choice of our special contributor perks.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're able, we encourage everybody to like us on facebook, sign up to our newsletter, follow us on Twitter and help spread the word.  Share our facebook posts when we publish news or simply tell your friends about us.  We'd love you for it!</p>
