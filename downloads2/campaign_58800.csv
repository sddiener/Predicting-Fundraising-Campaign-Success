<p>We have 11000 square meters of old farm land... Perfect digging material. But we need help to finish the project and to put in some new installments... </p>
<p>In the photo above we have more land on the other side of the road but that is what we have started with. We can go into the forest too.</p>
<p> We would like use the funding to pay for help with a workforce, one machine. Then install toilet, small snack house and maintenance school workshop. </p>
<p> This will be created for all ages, pump tracks small to large jumps, Rock gardens, wood features and training areas like switchbacks plus a foam pit.</p> This will be a great place to come all year round and learn biking tricks and techniques.</div><div> This is another place that helps to keep spreading the love for cycling and its knowledge.

Street and so onI have run my own cycle shop for a short time and organized a some local projects and displays.So now I live my days offering great cycle experiences at a low cost.I'm not interested in making a lot of money and I love making people happy. So I want to ask for help because we cant get funding or land from the government and there is people calling for cycling facilities like this.
We have 11000 square meters of old farm land... Perfect digging material. But we need help to finish the project and to put in some new installments... 
In the photo above we have more land on the other side of the road but that is what we have started with. We can go into the forest too.
 We would like use the funding to pay for help with a workforce, one machine. Then install toilet, small snack house and maintenance school workshop. 
 This will be created for all ages, pump tracks small to large jumps, Rock gardens, wood features and training areas like switchbacks plus a foam pit. This will be a great place to come all year round and learn biking tricks and techniques. This is another place that helps to keep spreading the love for cycling and its knowledge. Families can come from afar.. and in this local community gave a better connection.What We Need & What You GetThe funding will go to machine hire around 1500 euros3000 euros towards amenities3000 towards construction materials like wood workand the rest to give to the workforce that helps because I have found no volunteers Perks will include access to facilityAccomodation when on holidayGuided riding outside of the facilityand a few barbequesThe ImpactWe are sharing the knowledge of a new low cost location to holiday with your bike.

We all live on this world without borders, suspended around our Sun in the endlessness of space.. We are just a small dot in this vast cosmic arena, and our Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else to which our species could migrate in the immediate future. and no one to bail us out.  It is all a matter of survival, and we all know what we have to do, so let's just do it before its too late!!We need these funds to make our laboratory flywheel battery transportable and ship it to customers for demos. Also we have new technology ideas that will improve the flywheel's performance that need to be developed.
$75,000 to make laboratory flywheel transportable
$40,000 ship to several customers
$50,000 develop new technology
$35,000 to market to new customers
Energy
Storage Solutions is an exciting start-up company that has developed very new
eco-friendly flywheel battery (What is a flywheel battery?). Our flywheel batteries are robust, non-chemical, non-toxic, non-flammable totally Green battery. We have developed our flywheel with the help of seasoned engineers and a
development team with backgrounds from MIT, Texas A&M and the University of
Toronto. We have received three grants from New York State Energy Research
Development Agency (NYSERDA) for this work and have developed a
working prototype in Ottawa, Canada. 
We have demonstrated our 1kWh (Kilo Watt Hour) flywheel in
front of a major corporation and received much excitement. Our flywheel is 24 In. in diameter and 16 in. high. We now have customers that want to see a demo in
their facilities. For this reason, we now need your money to bring this working prototype to all our potential customers.Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, regenerative breaking cannot provide continuous energy or energy upon demand or follow a variable energy load. That's where energy storage comes in, making those energy sources more affordable and efficient. The most common storage is chemical batteries like lithium-ion, lead-acid. Chemical batteries have many drawbacks such as being made of toxic materials that pollute the environment and generate flammable gasses and have a short life span. ESS's flywheel battery has exciting new technologies that makes it the most environmentally friendly and much more efficient. This is done  by using our unique low friction, no-maintenance bearing technology and our unique motor that does not use any 'rare earth' materials that come from outright political and economically hostile areas around the globe.With the help of three New York State Energy Research Development Agency (NYSERDA) grants, we completed demonstration of our new technologies with a 1kWh(Kilo Watt Hour) flywheel shown below.  We have customers that want to see a demo in their facilities. We need your help to make the laboratory model transportable to customers and demonstrate the Green features and economical advantages of our flywheel. NYSERDA has said that they will help with designing a new larger 10kWh system but we need to get our existing system out to customers. If you can not contribute perhaps there are people you know who would be interested. Please let them know. Testing Lab  Testing TeamRendering of our larger 10kWh flywheel battery 6ft high cabinet. Interested Customers – With Your Funding Help We Can Build Our Ideal Prototype and Show it to:Singapore recently invited us to propose a demonstration project.New York City Dept of Citywide Services(DCAS) has expressed interest to evaluate our flywheel battery system.Thyssen-Krupp elevators saw a demonstration and requested a proposal to evaluate our system.University of Rochester, Galissano Institute expressed interest to evaluate our system.Syracuse University expressed interest to evaluate our system.New York Power Authority expressed interest to evaluate our system.Like us on facebook.   Visit our web site: http://www.ess-epowervault.com/

Quarter Midget Racing is a family oriented sport that involves racing in specially prepared race cars. The cars, rules and safety procedures are designed specifically for kids and governed by the United States Auto Club (USAC). Quarter midgets race on oval tracks approximately 1/20 of a mile long. Children ages 5 to 16 years can race.  Safety features include full roll cages, multi-point seat harnesses, full face helmets, and other safety gear. Drivers race for trophies, there are no cash prizes awarded.</p>

<ul>
<li>Today over 100 thousand of ships and vessels are on the seas and oceans.</li>
<li>Vessels and ships are using fuel to give them electricity.</li>
<li>One vessel uses 150-250 tons of fuel per a day.</li>
<li>Vessels and ships are using 3-4 tons of fuels per day to have electricity on them.</li>
<li>From this 100-150 tons of contaminates are polluting the environment.</li>
<li>Our environment is directly polluted more than 10 million of tons contamination on every single day.</li>
<li>This contamination is one of the main reasons of acidity of seawater, which causes coral harms and so damages the whole food chain which affects our lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately the list is endless we just collected some points to show the impact.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-family: 'Source Sans Pro'; font-size: 40px; color: rgb(70, 130, 186); font-weight: normal;"">The  SWES Energy Cell</span></h2>
<p>The members of SWES group have been doing archeological deep-sea researching for 20 years furthermore working on development of different research equipment.<br/>While we were working on the development of deep-sea research robot (ROV) we had an idea to have the necessary power-drive of the robot from its environment. This idea was the base of SWES Technology. </p>
<p>After having the concept we had been researching, developing, producing prototypes and testing for 4 years.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The basic electric power from seawater will be produced by SWES Energy Cell. </span>
</p>
<p>Development of the energy cell brought the achievement to the SWES Technology. Universities laboratories, engineers and institutes of environmental protection were instrumental in the development of SWES Technology.</p>
Development of this part was the most important and the most difficult task. <br/>One of the big challanges was that the used materials must be <b>completely environmentally friendly</b> as the energy cell has direct contact with the environment.
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/726495/files/20140718051317-cells.jpg?1405685597"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For today we are ready with <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">three different energy cells implemented control panels</span>. According to the needs of
use we created <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">3,2VDC, 5VDC and 12 VDC systems –first in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">We are the one and only who could
manage the separation of energy cells, which has made possible to build even more
100V units together.</span> This step was mandatory to fulfill the needs of special
places, which have more electricity usage, such as ships.</p>

<p><b>SWES-1 and SWES-3 dive lights are working only in seawater or in salt water.</b>Our technical development team is working on making it possible to use in fresh water also.<br/>We found the solution and the realization is still in progress. Immediately when the stable model of fresh water light will be ready we will publish it on all forums.</p>
<br/><h2><span style=""font-family: 'Source Sans Pro'; font-size: 40px; color: rgb(70, 130, 186); font-weight: normal;"">Planned to develop - The SWES Vision</span></h2>
<p><b>Light is just the beginning – a ship which does not harm the environment, quiet and cheap to maintain is our future.</b></p>
<p>An electric ship which is able to move as quiet and clean as a sailboat it is not a dream anymore.<br/>Imagine a world where your ship does not need a tank of fuel, just get on board and you can go. Sail without polluting the environment. </p>
<p>For SWES Technology it does not matter having rain, wind, or sunshine. The SWES energy cell provides the necessary electric energy from the seawater all day and night long, independently from weather conditions.  Thanks to the electric energy your ship can go in the deepest silence and let you enjoy the unique experience while you’re shipping around the sounds of nature.  </p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 28px; color: rgb(70, 130, 186); font-weight: normal;"">Develop</span></h3>
<blockquote>We do not believe in miracles. We have confidence in ourselves and in our knowledge.</blockquote>
<p>For us it was certainty one of the main directions of the development of SWES Technology will be the electric ship. As the <b>energy is coming directly from the seawater itself the ships are not running on fuel</b>.</p>
<p>We made the first steps already and we believe with supporters we can have all the possibilities to build the first prototype of SWES electric ship.</p>
<p>For an electric power-driven ship the needed energy level is higher than for a dive light. For our tests and examinations <b>we prepared the first energy cell unit from 8pcs of 12VDC energy cells, which provides all together 96VDC of voltage.</b></p>

</div></div>","Attention!!! Important!
Before choose any SWES Dive light PERK please read OUR SPECIAL OFFER in the „Updates” section!
SWES Technology
Electricity from sea-water anywhere
around the world, no charge, no maintenance – just put to the sea – light into
the green future!!!


For the first time in the World we
show SWES Technology on IndieGoGo campaign which is a new dimension in the field of alternative energy sources.
Sea Water Energy System (SWES) Technology means that it produces ready to use, clean and stable electric power from seawater in an environmentally friendly way. 
Our first product is a high power LED SWES Dive Light which is unique to the world. It lights up as soon as touches seawater and lighting until it is in salt water.
  The required energy to operate the dive light is provided by SWES Energy Cells which produces the basic electric power from seawater. 
  We have to trust that as technology develops for the human race, it will be an electric power source which feeds the required energy without harming the environment.
When we manage to gain this then it was worth the effort. 

We ask for your support to begin the serial production of the dive light and continue the development of SWES Technology. 
Help us and be a part of changing the World! We can make our future better, brighter and cleaner together!

We appreciate every bit of support. If you like to help us achieving our goals but can not contribute, it is no problem! You can still support us with sharing our project in social media.Thank you very much for your support!

Electricity from sea-water. Why is it important for our future?
We believe that the development of SWES Technology will make a better
  World.
Did you know?

Today over 100 thousand of ships and vessels are on the seas and oceans.
Vessels and ships are using fuel to give them electricity.
One vessel uses 150-250 tons of fuel per a day.
Vessels and ships are using 3-4 tons of fuels per day to have electricity on them.
From this 100-150 tons of contaminates are polluting the environment.
Our environment is directly polluted more than 10 million of tons contamination on every single day.
This contamination is one of the main reasons of acidity of seawater, which causes coral harms and so damages the whole food chain which affects our lives.

Unfortunately the list is endless we just collected some points to show the impact.
The  SWES Energy Cell
The members of SWES group have been doing archeological deep-sea researching for 20 years furthermore working on development of different research equipment.While we were working on the development of deep-sea research robot (ROV) we had an idea to have the necessary power-drive of the robot from its environment. This idea was the base of SWES Technology. 
After having the concept we had been researching, developing, producing prototypes and testing for 4 years.
The basic electric power from seawater will be produced by SWES Energy Cell. 

Development of the energy cell brought the achievement to the SWES Technology. Universities laboratories, engineers and institutes of environmental protection were instrumental in the development of SWES Technology.
Development of this part was the most important and the most difficult task. One of the big challanges was that the used materials must be completely environmentally friendly as the energy cell has direct contact with the environment.

For today we are ready with three different energy cells implemented control panels. According to the needs of
use we created 3,2VDC, 5VDC and 12 VDC systems –first in the world.
We are the one and only who could
manage the separation of energy cells, which has made possible to build even more
100V units together. This step was mandatory to fulfill the needs of special
places, which have more electricity usage, such as ships.
The First Product:  High Power LED SWES Dive Light
Our first product  is a dive light, light is not only for divers!
SWES Dive Light is unique to the world. The required
energy to operate the dive light is provided by energy cells of SWES
Technology.
                       
The SWES light is an extraordinary recourse for all


diver (skin divers, scuba divers, cave divers, deep divers, etc.)
sailor
fishermen
sport fishermen
boat and yacht owners
underwater photographer
aquatic fanatic

and everyone who loves the sea and wants to protect the environment.

Advantages and benefits


No battery and no charge needed. It is  a perfect choice for sport and deep divers, cave  and wreck divers, for sailors, for sport fishermen and for night fishing.

No maintenance needed. By 3-4 hours daily  usage you should change the anode in 3-4 years.

Ready to use. As soon as it touches seawater,  it lights up.

Completely environmentally friendly. All used  materials and also the way, how energy cells  produce energy are completely environmentally friendly. 
Lightweight (945-965g)
Easy to handle.
Unique, massive, solid design.
Magnetic switch with in off & dry state
Without touching seawater, consistency never compromise.

Also in off & dry state,consistency is not compromised.

Immediately when the stable model of fresh water light will be ready we will publish it on all forums.
Planned to develop - The SWES Vision
Light is just the beginning – a ship which does not harm the environment, quiet and cheap to maintain is our future.
An electric ship which is able to move as quiet and clean as a sailboat it is not a dream anymore.Imagine a world where your ship does not need a tank of fuel, just get on board and you can go. Sail without polluting the environment. 
For SWES Technology it does not matter having rain, wind, or sunshine. The SWES energy cell provides the necessary electric energy from the seawater all day and night long, independently from weather conditions.  Thanks to the electric energy your ship can go in the deepest silence and let you enjoy the unique experience while you’re shipping around the sounds of nature.  
Develop
We do not believe in miracles. We have confidence in ourselves and in our knowledge.
For us it was certainty one of the main directions of the development of SWES Technology will be the electric ship. As the energy is coming directly from the seawater itself the ships are not running on fuel.
We made the first steps already and we believe with supporters we can have all the possibilities to build the first prototype of SWES electric ship.
For an electric power-driven ship the needed energy level is higher than for a dive light. For our tests and examinations we prepared the first energy cell unit from 8pcs of 12VDC energy cells, which provides all together 96VDC of voltage.

8 pcs of 12VDC energy cells provide 96VDC which light up 64 pcs of Power LED.
With these tests we verified that the necessary energy level for ships can be produced by SWES energy cells.
The first period of development has two main phase.

In the first phase a high voltage
(540VDC) SWES energy cell RACK will be built and tested in laboratory. 
During the second phase we will build 4-6 RACKs and install these on a 6-8 meter length of ship and the RACKs will power-drive 2 pcs of out-board engine.

          
                             
According to our plan the first prototype will be ready for testing in the middle of 2015.

About us
Everyone has past and present – and everybody can have a future. 
Our past we worked in deep-sea research, this is where we met a lot of people committed to oceans, technology and green living.
The members of SWES group have been doing archeological deep-sea researching for 20 years furthermore working on development of different research equipment. Up to now 9 scientific expeditions in 7 countries were organized and lead by us, and many other instrumental research were realized. 

During our work we discovered more than 100 historical wrecks and 2000 year-old sank city, additionally we helped the authorities to investigate in different crimes and find bombs and explosives from World War ll. From our results more than hundreds of written and tele media reported and we arranged more successful
museum exhibition.
For more information please click on www.deepresearch.hu
Today our first priority is to start serial producing of the SWES Dive light and finish the prototype of SWES Ship.
Today a drop  - tomorrow drops will become a sea.
In the future lot of possibilities are waiting for us – we researched for footprints of our past in the depth of the ocean and found a future opportunity in
electric power resources.
Risk and challenges
We have challenges to help finding better ways to build perfect products. 
So we often risk.  
And our products are safe – even working with electricity under water.
Our products are assembled with electric shock protection and accident protection. 
FAQs
Do I need to add the cost of shipping to my pledge?
For all destinations, please add the amount specified in the perk description.
Local import taxes may apply.
I can't get my payment to work in Paypal, what
should I do?
Email the IndieGoGo Customer Happiness Team at support@indiegogo.com. They'll be able to track your transaction and help with any issues.
What kind of sea-water will be fine for the light?
All around the world and an all lakes where the salt content is over 0, 9%.
Will the ship first way opened?
Unfortunately everybody can not join, we have perks where an all-inclusive journey can be won, otherwise only invited can participate. Certainly our results will be published on our website,
What if we fail to reach the funding target?
We appreciate every bit of support we receive during the 40 days, and every backer will be welcomed into the SWES technology. If we don’t reach our target then we will focus only on dive light production and small SWES devices (black box for
ships), and later on we will start a new campaign or form from the revenue of
the light and we will continue working on the ship.
What if my question isn’t answered here?
We’re happy to respond to any other queries you might have about the SWES Technology, the IndieGoGo campaign, and our company as a whole. Email us:

<h3>About Taylor and her Fight!</h3>
<p>Taylor, a student at Winlock Middle School, must put her summer on hold while she travels to Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia, PA to receive Proton Beam Therapy for 10 weeks for her Ganglioglioma Tumor in her left temporal lobe. This is her third battle with a brain tumor, and she has had two previous resection surgeries in November of 2005 and October of 2010.  A resection surgery is not an option at this time as there would be too much damage to the healthy brain.</p>
<p>Says Karen, Taylor’s mother, “Taylor is a special young lady who just wants more than anything to be like other kids, not the tumor girl she has been tagged…we are hoping and praying that this is the treatment that we need to get this behind us once and for all.”</p>
<p>Taylor is a budding artist who loves to doodle and draw.  She was able to play a sport for the first time this past year and is looking forward to her second chance to play basketball when the season begins this year.   There are not enough words to describe the awesome impact Taylor has on anyone she meets.   She is positive and strong even when battling these brain tumors.    ""Don't Quit Keep Fighting!"" has become her motto.  </p>
</div>
<h3>How can YOU help?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Donate to this great young lady and her family to help allievate some of the burden and stress as they are trying to focus on treatment.</li>
<li>Taylor and her mom are in Philadelphia, PA receiving Proton Beam Therapy for Taylor's Ganglioglioma Tumor in her left temporal lobe.   Her mother is unable to work while they are in Philadelphia receiving treatment.  All the funds are going to support the family and their needs at this time. </li>
<li>Taylor picked out the phrase and colors of the bracelets, ""Don't Quit Keep Fighting, TMR!""</li>
<li>All funds are going to support the family with all expenses they are incurring while receiving treatment.</li>
</ul><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Taylor and her family have never asked for help and we had to persuade them to allow us to assist with some of the financial burden.  We held a silent auction and concert right after she left for her Proton Beam Therapy treatment and were able to raise $3,800.   Every little bit helps to allievate some of the stress that mom and Taylor are feeling.  We want them to focus on her therapy, not whether they will have the money to cover all the costs.    Taylor deserves a chance to shine for a long time in this world.  She will bring a lot of positives and smiles today and in her future endeavors.  Please help give to Taylor and let her feel the support we all have for her!</p>
<h3>Other donations and Support!</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone can help with a monetary donation, however prayers and positive thoughts go a long way as well.  Thank you!!! Taylor's family appreciates all of your thoughts, and well wishes during this time.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Matthew and I am a OEF/OIF Veteran who was an avionics technician who also graduated as a United States Aircrewman and Search and Rescue Swimmer. I was a deployed service member four times from the year 2004 to 2008.The stress of being deployed in the middle east or worldwide away from my family and everything I loved was tough. Every time I had the chance of liberty (free time abroad) I booked a round of golf and the relaxation felt nearly as good as home. I want to spread the relief and relaxation to the thousand of service members, newly seperated veterans, and wounded warriors of the valley of the sun. My goal is to raise enough to pay for one twosome round a week and create a new story 52 times over the next year.You will feel fantastic honoring our nations heroes. From what I have expierienced giving back to the veterans and service members gives you a great feeling that lasts a lifetime. Help me achive these rounds for heroes and I will cap the year off with an inspirational short film including pictures, thank you's, as well as a 16 man tournament with a share of the donations and a new set of clubs going to the veteran / service member with the lowest score.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need enough to fund;</p>
<ul>
<li>52 rounds of golf in the best courses Arizona has to offer</li>
<li>A refreshed set of clubs (right now I have 3 sets) 2 men , 1 womens. I would love to fund a new set for the Vets to hack away with.</li>
<li>52 dozen golf balls - Pinnacle Folds of Honor (They give back as well )</li>
<li>1,000 tees</li>
<li>Golf Refreshments</li>
</ul>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal 100% of funds will still be spent providing free rounds of golf for veterans, or sending golf equipment to the USO abroad for deployed service members to use. None of the funds will be used for personal profit or gain just golf and transportation if needed.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Golf has proven to be a very spiritual and relaxing sport and I have personally read of many rehabing veterans using Golf as an escape for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or coping with the reality of life outside the service. I have met many veterans at the VA hospital locally and explained my goals, and they have always been warmly welcomed. I will have postings with sign ups for tee times at the Veterans Affairs hospital , Luke Air Base, and the metro phoenix recruiting stations.  Every round will have a photo posted to the wall of my facebook page <a href=""http://www"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www</a>.<span>facebook.com/</span><span class=""timelineUsername fwb"">GolfForeHeroes with a special thank you to all that donated.

<h3>Help us raise money to cover the screening cost so 100% of ticket sales can go to COTA!</h3>
<p>Compelling and evocative without being sentimental,<em> The Power of Two,</em> featuring and based on the true story of twin sisters Anabel Stenzel and Isabel Stenzel Byrnes, follows their efforts to each receive life-saving double lung transplants, as a result of being afflicted with Cystic Fibrosis.  The film shines a revealing and hopeful light on the plight of patients with genetic diseases, such as Cystic Fibrosis, who require organ transplants in order to defeat the inevitably life-shortening ravages of their diseases.</p>
<p>As did the Stenzel twins, Dustin Lucas now requires a double lung transplant in order to conquer and survive the degenerative effects of Cystic Fibrosis.  Dustin, a 25 year old resident of San Luis Obispo, and his family - father David Lucas, sister Amber Lucas, local mom Cheryl Lenhardt, all residents of SLO; and Northern California Mom, Gina Borquez - have teamed up with COTA, a national 501©(3) non-profit organization, to ensure that one hundred percent of all funds raised in honor of Dustin are used only for transplant-related expenses.  It is currently estimated that Dustin is facing $40,000 in out of pocket expenses attendant to his anticipated transplant surgery.</p>

Compelling and evocative without being sentimental, The Power of Two, featuring and based on the true story of twin sisters Anabel Stenzel and Isabel Stenzel Byrnes, follows their efforts to each receive life-saving double lung transplants, as a result of being afflicted with Cystic Fibrosis.  The film shines a revealing and hopeful light on the plight of patients with genetic diseases, such as Cystic Fibrosis, who require organ transplants in order to defeat the inevitably life-shortening ravages of their diseases.
As did the Stenzel twins, Dustin Lucas now requires a double lung transplant in order to conquer and survive the degenerative effects of Cystic Fibrosis.  Dustin, a 25 year old resident of San Luis Obispo, and his family - father David Lucas, sister Amber Lucas, local mom Cheryl Lenhardt, all residents of SLO; and Northern California Mom, Gina Borquez - have teamed up with COTA, a national 501©(3) non-profit organization, to ensure that one hundred percent of all funds raised in honor of Dustin are used only for transplant-related expenses.  It is currently estimated that Dustin is facing $40,000 in out of pocket expenses attendant to his anticipated transplant surgery.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<p>My name is Bethanie and I have struggled with several mental illnesses throught my life. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and PTSD related to childhood trauma. </p>
<p>This campaign is to help me be able to get the mental healthcare that I so desperately need. I cannot afford insurance and all of my state insurance applications have been denied despite me meeting all of the criteria. Without assistance I will not be able to get the care that I need in order to be a functioning member of society, which I so desperately want to be.</p>
<p>Helping me get mental healthcare will drastically improve my quality of life, as well as the quality of life for my daughter. It is crucial that I stay on my medication so that I can be the best mother I can be and also a self-sustaining adult. Your contributions are invaluable to me as being able to afford and stay on my medication will help me to become a strong and independent person who can control my moods as opposed to having any little thing push me over the edge. I don't want to self harm anymore, I don't want to contemplate suicide daily and getting the care I need will make those thoughts diminish significantly. You really could be saving my life. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>I have set my funding goal for $500. My psychiatrist visits are $100 each and my medication comes out to around $230 each month. That's $330 a month to stay sane. I set it to $500 so that I would be able to afford a subsequent visit to my psychiatrist, and hopefully by that time my mental state will have improved enough that I can manage to afford the medication itself. </p>
<p>Despite my many mental illnesses, I am a very kind and fun loving person. I'm an artist and love to paint, draw and write. I'm currently working on my first book which will detail the trials and tribulations I have faced as a young girl in the 21st century. I am very passionate about feminism and helping others when I can. This is my cry for help, which is a bit hard for me as usually I just keep my needs to myself and hope I can handle myself for just awhile longer, though now I am realizing that I cannot do this alone. </p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal I will put what I do raise towards my psychiatric visits. I have opened a savings account just for this purpose. Any money pledged will go towards my mental healthcare and nothing else. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I know that if I can get back on my meds and become stable I can be an invaluable member of society. I love volunteering and helping others and will do my best to pay it forward to those in need. This fund will also help me to become a better mother to my child who deserves the very best. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p>I understand that there are some of you that can't help financially, but I would greatly appreciate it if you could help get the word out and share this wherever you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>I also appreciate words of encouragement and get well soon cards! </p>
<p>There's also this really great indiegogo share tool and that will help spread the word on my campaign! Utilize it if you feel so inclined, I would greatly appreciate it!</p>

<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"">Baktuli is North America's first stylish towel line dedicated for athletics. Our products are made of 100% cotton which is soft on the skin and good for the environment. So far we have made colourful towels yoga that are body length and fit over the yoga mat. Our featured project for Indiegogo is a workout towel that you can take to the gym. This workout towel resembles a scarf and there is a hole in the middle of the towel so that it won't fall off your shoulders when exercising. We use an organic based anti-microbial from Microbanâ„¢ called Microban PB which is safe for use and EPA approved. </font></p>

<h3>One Life Challenge</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>How many
times have you wished you had the motivation to run a marathon, climb a
mountain or participate in a 100 mile bike race? For some it’s once a year, for
others it’s every decade, and for the great majority of us it seems to creep
into our minds as we approach middle age; only to prove we are not quite
over-the-hill. The truth is that most of us at some time in our lives have
wondered if we still have it in us to complete such a challenge. The answer may
not lie in whether we are in prime condition to complete such a task, but
rather whether we can find the motivation to see it through.</p>
<p><span>Both of my sisters died from Cancer!</span></p>
<p><span>I am the lucky one!  I'm the sister that carries the light and the hope forward for the family. I accept that I am the one who was left behind to be the advocate for “SEND ME ON VACATION”, (<a href=""http://www.sendmeonvacation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sendmeonvacation.com</a>).  My intention is  to honor the lives that my sisters lead before, during and after the challenges they faced dealing with cancer. They left me with an incredible gift to share with mankind. The challenges my sisters faced, what all cancer patients face,  are indescribable, yet every day they meet these obstacles with a brave heart.  When my sisters passed, I needed to turn the pain into something tangible...so I ran.  I ran until I couldn’t<br/>run any longer. </span>I got DVT (blood clot) from a band I put around my leg to help me with my running.  It took a year to get off the Warfarin (Coumadin) and again today, I run. Next month,  I am participating in a Triathlon. My goal is to raise enough money, through donations, to send a breast cancer survivor on a well deserved vacation in honor of my sisters. It  is a wonderful gift, and one I am so proud to be a part of. </p>
<p>Please sponsor me and contribute to my campaign! I'm participating in a Triathlon in<br/>St. George, October 12, 2013.</p>

Sitaram's Upcoming SurgeryThe family is doing better, mom Rani is in remission and is getting treated for her CML, and Sitaram's next reconstructive surgery is scheduled for this month. The two younger boys are in school and thriving, and they are all beginning to lead normal lives. Please continue to support the family as Sitaram goes through his next three or four reconstructive surgeries to restore his mouth area. He still can't eat normally or close his mouth properly, and has no tongue and teeth. But he's living as normal a teenager life as possible, thanks to you! Stretch Goal! Help Mom Rani with Medical Expenses We are so grateful for your support, which has helped us hit our initial goal to assist Seetaram's family with food and housing for their stay in Mysore. Now, let's keep it going and help their mom Rani with her medical emergency. Soon after moving to their house, Rani experienced severe stomach pain. She went to the hospital but they were unable to help her (government hospital facilities are a challenge for many reasons). We transferred her to a quality medical facility, where the doctors diagnosed CML leukemia -- devastating news, especially after all that has happened to the family. Poondev, Rani's husband, was told of the news by the doctor, and it was almost too much for him to bear. First, his son. Then, his mother in Bihar died. Now his wife.Poondev after hearing the news.Rani is in ICU for three days, where they are monitoring her blood pressure and other vitals. They have started medication to help reduce her white cell count but she still has spontaneous bleeding in her abdomen (the cause of her pain).The initial estimation for the hospital stay is $1,500. Please consider making a donation to cover this additional expense.On a good note, we took Poondev to see his younger sons (age 5 and 6), who are staying temporarily at our children's home. The boys were overjoyed to see dad! ""Papa papa!"" And then they told him everything they've been up to -- mostly playing like fiends -- and the hot meals they get (!) because they experienced several mealtimes with no food to eat.On July 30, Rani was discharged from the hospital, and we moved the entire family to our home, so they could be together -- for the first time since February they were not in a hospital! -- and we could better manage their situation. 
On August 3, little Bharath and Lakshman, Sitaram's brothers, started school! They were really excited and looked very cute in their school uniforms.
Sitaram is well -- he is eating a lot so that he can gain weight for his next surgery at the end of September -- he won't be able to eat for a while after the surgery so is trying to eat a lot now. He has started tutoring at our home with our teachers.Thank you again for your generous support.

The DCPU (District Child Protection Unit) of Mysore contacted us in mid-June for assistance, which is how we heard about the family's situation.
We've begun to provide the family with money for food and have found temporary housing for them. One of our street moms, Kumari, generously offered a small room in her small house in the slum to them.

<p><br/><br/> (Roger's Letter)<br/> To NFL Fans:<br/><br/> The 2012 NFL regular season is about to begin, and it promises to be another exciting, competitive, and unpredictable year of football which NFL fans have come to expect every season. <br/><br/> Part of our responsibility in helping teams and players prepare for each NFL season is to make sure they understand and respect league policies and rules. As always, we hold everyone, including ourselves, strictly accountable for protecting the integrity of the game, starting with the health and safety of our players. This year is no exception - bringing with it a clear, consistent, and renewed emphasis on enforcing our longstanding “bounty” prohibition. <br/><br/> Let me be clear: there is no place for bounties in football. No exceptions. No excuses. Bounties are an affront to everything that competitive sports should represent. Everyone in the NFL is responsible for adhering to these rules and we are all accountable for protecting the safety of our players - present and future. <br/><br/> The bounty prohibition forbids offering or accepting any reward - cash or otherwise - for on-field misconduct, plays that incentivize or result in injury to opposing players, or for performance against an opposing player, group of players, or team. The bounty prohibition not only preserves the competitive integrity of our game, but also protects player safety by removing incentives that could lead to dangerous play or unnecessary and/or intentional injury. As a league, we will ensure that the prohibition against bounties is clearly understood and consistently enforced. Period. <br/><br/> We will aggressively protect the health, safety and long-term livelihood of our players, both on the field and off. We can preserve the fierce competition that makes football great, while simultaneously committing to the relentless pursuit of safer play. Our players do not make excuses on the field; we will not make them off the field. <br/><br/> It is our job to protect, preserve, and promote the game of football that we all love. We want an exciting game featuring the worlds most talented football players enjoying long and successful careers. The bounty prohibition plays an instrumental role in achieving that. And we are committed to holding every team, player and owner accountable. <br/><br/> We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the 2012 NFL season. <br/> Roger Goodell</p></div>","T.J Lang has rightfully been outspoken about the robbery of our beloved game by the NFL and the replacement refs.

<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Our goal was to develop a simple and reliable water treatment system that provides a permanent source of high-purity, sterile water from any source of water, even ocean water, that can be easily deployed anywhere in the world. We succeeded! Now we need your help to raise $1 million so we can fine-tune the design and create the infrastructure to bring it to market.</span><br/>
</div><br/>Thank you for checking out my project. I have been developing and fine-tuning the Survival Still over the past decade, but a wise man* wrote a book that kicked me in the pants and made me realize that itâ€™s now time to make it public and solicit support so we can start saving lives. <br/><br/><font size=""5""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Problem</span></font><br/>The global water crisis is devastating! Every few seconds a parent watches helplessly as their child dies from diarrhea because of unclean water. Thousands of children die every day! Right now, over ONE BILLION people donâ€™t have access to clean drinking water.<br/><br/>Everybody wants to protect their loved ones, but itâ€™s hard to lift your family out of poverty when you are constantly sick or dying from dysentery, arsenic poisoning or parasites. The global water crisis is one of the most serious problems facing this planet. <br/><br/>How can this be? We are wealthy, incredibly generous and we have the will, but something is missing...<br/><br/>The problem is that we have been trying to use the wrong technologies to fix the problem. Filters work fairly well in the US, but not so well in 2nd and 3rd world countries. In poor countries, people have to deal with extremely contaminated water that is often full of sand, mud, toxic metals, mining chemicals, petrochemicals and deadly microbes. <br/><br/>The main reason that filters donâ€™t and CANâ€™T solve the water crisis is something that you already know; all filters eventually fail, which is why you have to keep changing your filters every few months. In the USA, if the filter on your faucet fails your water may not taste as good as it did yesterday, but when your filter fails in a 2nd or 3rd world country deadly parasites or bacteria (such as cholera) could pass through without you even knowing it! <br/><br/>Filters simply canâ€™t solve the water crisis. Neither can ozone, UV Lights, or chemicals, like chlorine. <br/><br/><font size=""5""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">We Need A Better Solutionâ€¦</span></font><br/>Pure Water Revolution is taking a different approach to solving the water crisis. Our goal was to develop a simple and  reliable water treatment system that provides a permanent source of high-purity, sterile water from any source of water, including ocean water, that can be easily deployed anywhere in the world. We succeeded!<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>The result; the Survival Still. <br/><br/><font size=""5""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Survival StillÂ®</span></font><br/>The Survival Still produces high-purity, sterile drinking water from any source water, even ocean water. Itâ€™s extremely effective on all types of contaminants, and unlike filters, itâ€™s a permanent solution.<br/>â€¢    The Survival Still permanently supplies high-purity, sterile water. <br/>â€¢    Is extremely effective against all types of contaminants.<br/>â€¢    Kills and removes bacteria, viruses and parasites.<br/>â€¢    Is a permanent solution for purifying sea water.<br/>â€¢    Does not need filters, electricity, infrastructure or a supply chain.<br/>â€¢    Is a single, global solution.<br/> <br/><img align=""left"" alt=""Pure Water Revolution"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.purewaterrevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/How-does-the-SS-Work.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><font size=""5""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Survival Still will change the worldâ€¦</span></font><br/>We can give a Survival Still to a family anywhere in the world and from that point on, and for the rest of their lives they wonâ€™t have to worry about water purity again. Their families will be protected from biological contaminants, toxic metals, petrochemicals and even radioactive contaminants. They will lead healthier lives. They will be better able to educate themselves and give back to their communities. Fewer children will die.<br/><br/>In addition to improved water purity, families in 3rd world countries will have greater access to water, because they can use the ocean or other previously off-limit water supply as their source water.<br/><br/><font size=""5""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Proof</span></font><br/>Recently, we ran ocean water through the Survival Still. The ocean water had over 30,000 parts per million (ppm) of contaminants in the water, which is highly contaminated. After running the water through the Survival Still, it had only 6 ppm! This is a 99.98% reduction, and since it uses the process of distillation, these results will remain consistent for the life of the machine. In addition, the water was contaminated with bacteria. The Survival Still has NEVER had anything less than 100% removal of bacteria. <br/><br/><font size=""5"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Need the Money Forâ€¦</font><br/>The proof of concept is done. The Survival Still is extremely effective. Now we need to take the R&amp;D to the next level by recruiting the best minds in the water distiller industry and other industries to create the ultimate unit for families in 3rd world countries. <br/><br/>We want to make it even more effective, suitable for as many locations as possible, easier to use, lower cost and possibly reduced energy requirements.

Thank you for checking out my project. I have been developing and fine-tuning the Survival Still over the past decade, but a wise man* wrote a book that kicked me in the pants and made me realize that itâ€™s now time to make it public and solicit support so we can start saving lives. The ProblemThe global water crisis is devastating! Every few seconds a parent watches helplessly as their child dies from diarrhea because of unclean water. Thousands of children die every day! Right now, over ONE BILLION people donâ€™t have access to clean drinking water.Everybody wants to protect their loved ones, but itâ€™s hard to lift your family out of poverty when you are constantly sick or dying from dysentery, arsenic poisoning or parasites. The global water crisis is one of the most serious problems facing this planet. How can this be? We are wealthy, incredibly generous and we have the will, but something is missing...The problem is that we have been trying to use the wrong technologies to fix the problem. Filters work fairly well in the US, but not so well in 2nd and 3rd world countries. In poor countries, people have to deal with extremely contaminated water that is often full of sand, mud, toxic metals, mining chemicals, petrochemicals and deadly microbes. The main reason that filters donâ€™t and CANâ€™T solve the water crisis is something that you already know; all filters eventually fail, which is why you have to keep changing your filters every few months. In the USA, if the filter on your faucet fails your water may not taste as good as it did yesterday, but when your filter fails in a 2nd or 3rd world country deadly parasites or bacteria (such as cholera) could pass through without you even knowing it! Filters simply canâ€™t solve the water crisis. Neither can ozone, UV Lights, or chemicals, like chlorine. We Need A Better Solutionâ€¦Pure Water Revolution is taking a different approach to solving the water crisis. Our goal was to develop a simple and  reliable water treatment system that provides a permanent source of high-purity, sterile water from any source of water, including ocean water, that can be easily deployed anywhere in the world. We succeeded! The result; the Survival Still. The Survival StillÂ®The Survival Still produces high-purity, sterile drinking water from any source water, even ocean water. Itâ€™s extremely effective on all types of contaminants, and unlike filters, itâ€™s a permanent solution.â€¢    The Survival Still permanently supplies high-purity, sterile water. â€¢    Is extremely effective against all types of contaminants.â€¢    Kills and removes bacteria, viruses and parasites.â€¢    Is a permanent solution for purifying sea water.â€¢    Does not need filters, electricity, infrastructure or a supply chain.â€¢    Is a single, global solution. The Survival Still will change the worldâ€¦We can give a Survival Still to a family anywhere in the world and from that point on, and for the rest of their lives they wonâ€™t have to worry about water purity again. Their families will be protected from biological contaminants, toxic metals, petrochemicals and even radioactive contaminants. They will lead healthier lives. They will be better able to educate themselves and give back to their communities. Fewer children will die.In addition to improved water purity, families in 3rd world countries will have greater access to water, because they can use the ocean or other previously off-limit water supply as their source water.The ProofRecently, we ran ocean water through the Survival Still. The ocean water had over 30,000 parts per million (ppm) of contaminants in the water, which is highly contaminated. After running the water through the Survival Still, it had only 6 ppm! This is a 99.98% reduction, and since it uses the process of distillation, these results will remain consistent for the life of the machine. In addition, the water was contaminated with bacteria. The Survival Still has NEVER had anything less than 100% removal of bacteria. What We Need the Money Forâ€¦The proof of concept is done. The Survival Still is extremely effective. Now we need to take the R&D to the next level by recruiting the best minds in the water distiller industry and other industries to create the ultimate unit for families in 3rd world countries. We want to make it even more effective, suitable for as many locations as possible, easier to use, lower cost and possibly reduced energy requirements. Our goal is to optimize the design so we can mass produce it and get the lowest costs possible. We will need tooling, product coatings, testing, prototypes, extensive third-party testing and certifications. We will develop manufacturing infrastructure, and relationships with businesses that will be able to handle the production requirements. In addition to making the unit better, we will be developing graphic instructions as well as researching different technologies for audible instructions in many languages for people who canâ€™t read.  We will finish forming our charity, create our website, fine-tune the branding and marketing, and team up with non-profit charities and churches all across the world. In addition to this, as part of our effort to raise awareness and to educate people about Pure Water Revolution and the importance of this project, we will be creating a short documentary film about the creation of the Survival Still and all the thought that goes into creating the best possible solution. We are asking for contributions of $1 million (from IndieGoGo and elsewhere) for this development work.

<h3>Who is Dawn?</h3>
<p>Dawn is only 39 years old.  Dawn and I got married in April of 2010.  She and I both had travelled a long road to find each other.  She even sang to me a rendition of ""God Blessed the Broken Road"" at our wedding.  Not a dry eye in the place, including mine!  Before we found each other, Dawn had four beautiful and wonderful girls.  I had two handsome sons.  We were living our own lives, but knew life would not be complete without each other. </p>
<p>A little after we got married, Dawn developed a ""turning"" in her left hand.  She had already been diagnosed with Graves' Disease, but once that was brought under control, her symptoms progressed into tremors in her left hand, and eventually her left arm.  She has been to several doctors: neurologists, movement specialists, endocrinologists, you name it.  All signs have pointed to early-onset Parkinson's Disease.</p>
<p>Unfortunately not much data or research is available for PD, much less people in their 30's that develop it.  It is very unusual for people under 50 to develop PD, and most of the new diagnoses are for people 65 or older.  Her symptoms most closely resemble PD, but again with so little data available to support a diagnosis, her doctors have recommended a DaTscan.  This procedure is a new development, having been approved for use on the public just in 2011.  It is so new that insurance will not cover it.  We do, and are very grateful to have health insurance, but unfortunately a DaTscan is not in their menu of coverage,</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Need Help</h3>
Through the myriad doctor's appointments, copayments, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket expenses, simply getting to this point has been a challenge for our family.  We fear it will only be a further challenge as long as we do not know if we are dealing with Parkinson's.  Granted a DaTscan, much like a doctor's diagnosis, cannot be expected to be 100% reliable, but the DaTscan could at the very least rule out other conditions that resemble PD, or to that end, rule out PD altogether.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But we may never be able to rule anything out until whatever it is has progressed to a point beyond doctors' abilities to provide effective treatment.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Will Do With Funding</h3>
The doctors estimate the DaTscan can cost $2,500+ itself, but Dawn may also need to spend a night or two in the hospital, again with no insurance coverage.  We are therefore asking for your help to pay for the DaTscan and immediate associated costs...no more.  We are not looking to get rich or to make spending money.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are setting the initial goal at $5,000.  Anything we get above $5,000 will go to charity - 100% of it.  If the hospital says the cost will be less than $5,000, the difference will go to charity.  Simply put, if we raise more than the actual cost of the DaTscan and hospital stay, 100% of the difference will go to charity.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our chosen charity for any excess funding in this campaign is the Parkinson's Disease Foundation.</div>

<h3>If You Can't Contribute</h3>
All is not lost!  Dawn has become active in raising awareness for Parkinson's Disease.  PD affects about 1,000,000 pepole in the U.S., a very small proportion of who develop PD before the age of 40.  Though PD is a known condition, it is not as well-documented as other disorders.  PD is not a deadly disease, at least directly.  It can however leave sufferers completely disabled, requiring assistance to do even simple things like brushing teeth, tying shoes, or bathing.  If you can't contibute to our campaign, please visit the Parkinson's Disease Foundation's web site at <a href=""http://www.pdf.org,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pdf.org,</a> and talk to your friends and family about Parkinson's Disease.  Dawn and I, and all those whose lives are touched by Parkinson's Disease will be eternally grateful.</div></div>","Who is Dawn?

<p>My name is Kim and I am Josh's girlfriend of 7 years.</p>
<p>On January 28, 2012, our family dog, Porkchop, got into a fight with another pit bull. As Josh &amp; our roommate got the dogs separated and Josh was leading Porkchop to his room, Porkchop was able to turn his head and latch onto his right arm. It was in the heat of the moment and Porkchop was pretty angry. He had been an extremely loving dog and a big baby up until this incident. He loved Josh more than anyone else in the house. </p>
<p>Porkchop had a hold of Josh's arm for only 10-15 minutes but did extensive damage. Police responded within minutes of me calling 911 and had to taze the dog in order to get him off of Josh's arm. When EMS responded, Josh had managed to crawl out into our dining room floor and collapsed, going into shock. While at the hospital, Josh ended up in surgery because as doctors looked at his arm, they realized he had no feeling in his hand. Two muscles had been severed, there was tendon damage and the nerve had luckily only been chewed up. From the photos, you'll see how doctors were able to put his arm back together. Unfortunately, Josh lost all use of his right hand (and yes, this is his dominant hand). Initial doctors said that he would probably not regain use of it. Over the last couple of months, Josh's wrist has contractured badly, meaning that it has bent down and will not raise back up.</p>
<p>Josh's aunt has a neighbor who is a hand specialist and when she told him of Josh's story, he wanted to see him right away. Now, this doctor is hopeful that Josh can regain the use of his hand back through surgery and intense physical therapy. Josh has been out of work since the incident and the company he worked with did not offer any kind of insurance when he was working. I had been out of work for 2 and a half years before this incident and have only been working for 1 month. So right now, we do not have the funds to make this happen. The doctor is trying to work with us to figure out how to pay for the surgery and everything else so that Josh can regain the use of his right hand.</p>
<p>This money will go towards Josh's surgery and physical therapy after the surgery. Josh wants to be able to return to work. We've struggled over the last few months financially. We almost lost our house until I got a job. I'm only working for minimum wage and we have to rent one of our bedrooms out in order to make ends meet. We are extremely grateful for anything that anyone can help with.</p>

<p>The invasions of Abyei in 2008 and in May 2011 resulted in utter disaster, involving loss of lives and property, and displacement of150,000 Ngok Dinka residents.  The deployment of the UN Interim Security Force in Abyei (UNISFA), the Ethiopian Peacekeepers, has improved the security in the area.  The Ngok Dinka of Abyei are now seeking to return, but all of their possessions were burned and or looted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The people of Abyei are in need of disaster assistance to overcome the life safety challenges upon returning to an area devoid of basic shelter and clean water, with fatal health risks such as water borne illnesses and malaria.  The schools, health facilities, and churches were also devastated during the invasions of Abyei.  There is an overall need for transitional shelters that can serve as temporary facilities for the resumption of life in Abyei.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> Disaster Aid USA (DAUSA), and Disaster Aid International (DAI) offer to implement the Shelter, Clean Water, and Disease Reduction Initiative, which is an integrated service delivery program for Family Survival Kits, which contain transitional shelter facilities combined with health risk reduction, and solar lighting.

<p>... but she is likely going to die if she can’t continue to get treatment for a heart disease that has already killed several members of her family – and that’s if the bills don’t kill her first. That may sound like an exaggeration, but when your house is close to foreclosure (we narrowly avoided a foreclosure sale in September) and you can’t afford food, electricity and gas most months, let alone the hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills owed and an ongoing need for health insurance premium funds and medicine, well, you can imagine the stress. And stress like that is bad news for Amy’s heart. Which is in bad enough shape of its own.    </p>
<h3>Amy has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ...</h3>
<p>... which is genetic (it killed her dad when he was 46 and at least one teenage cousin; another cousin survived thanks to a heart transplant). It causes her heart to go out of normal rhythm and into a racing rhythm. This makes her body think she’s running a marathon, which would be good, except she’s not and it doesn’t stop, which is bad. It exhausts her, leads to heart failure and makes even the slightest exertion overwhelming.</p>
<h3>But first let me introduce you to Amy ...</h3>
<p>For more than 20 years, she was a respected journalist in Georgia – in Valdosta, Augusta, Savannah, Hinesville and back to Augusta again. She’s reported on everything, from city government to crime to the military to the death of legendary soul singer (and Augustan) James Brown one Christmas Day. But she hasn’t just reported. She also helped those she wrote about too. Here are two examples: Once, during floods in Savannah, she and another reporter walked back to the newsroom (her truck was stuck on a flooded street), wrote their stories and then went back out in the rain and bought food, drinks and diapers to give to the people they’d met at a shelter. Another time, an elderly woman called the newsroom in Augusta because her Meals on Wheels hadn’t been delivered in days, and she was diabetic, in a wheelchair and almost out of food. Amy gave her own debit card to a friend (Amy couldn’t leave work) and asked her to buy groceries and deliver them to this woman.</p>
<p>Amy’s also helped her friends over the years too. I met her when she helped me with one of my first stories as a reporter and I had no idea who the subject was or what I was doing really. She also invited me to her home for food before I received my first paycheck, and later, she organized a surprise party for me because she saw I was down in the dumps and missing home on my first birthday away. And all this was before she threw me a bridal shower a few years later and single-handedly rescued my son’s first birthday party (let’s just say planning is not my thing, and my guests would have starved except for birthday cake).</p>
<p>Amy left journalism a few years ago to continue to help, this time her mother, Miss Annette, who was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. Like any mother-daughter, Amy and Annette had their differences over the years, but there was no way that Amy was going to send her mother off to be cared for by somebody else. Amy has no siblings, and her dad died in 1976. For years, Amy rarely left Annette’s side, even if that meant being homebound for the most part when it became too difficult to take Annette out to visit friends. Amy used up her 401K so they could live on that and Miss Annette’s retirement pay as a teacher just to get by in those years.</p>
<p>Miss Annette died last year, and soon after, Amy knew the exhaustion she was feeling was more than grief.  She’d been to various doctors over the years and received various diagnoses, none correct. Her condition has deteriorated rapidly, from just getting winded easily to barely being able to move and having fainting spells. She’s had a pacemaker and a defibrillator implanted, and those have helped keep her alive (people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are at great risk for sudden death – in fact it is a well-known cause of sudden death in seemingly healthy athletes), but she will likely need a heart transplant in the near future.</p>
<p>Even so, Amy works a part-time writing job from home. She doesn’t want to have to beg for money. She wants to be the one TO help people, not receive help. But her part-time work barely pays for her utilities and this is where she is in life now. Her friends have helped and continue to help, but the need goes beyond us. Meanwhile, Amy has applied for Social Security disability, but her case hasn’t been approved yet. And the bills keep pouring in.</p>
<h3>I can’t promise a fantastic reward for helping Amy ...</h3>
<p>... I can promise you my (and her) personal thanks and a lifetime of gratitude to you. $5, $10, $1,000 (hey, it COULD happen!) – every bit will help my friend survive a bit longer. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>

</ul>
<p>My name is Thandiwe Nonceba Austin,and I am based in Johannesburg, South Africa(<a href=""http://www.rooftops.ca/english/newsResources/index.asp?page=186"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.rooftops.ca/english/newsResources/index.asp?page=186</a>). I am an ex sex worker, living positively with AIDS, and an activist for sex workers who want to exit due to illness. We are starting around the streets of Johannesburg, and we beliive that with contributions from funders like you, we can make a huge impact.</p>
<p>We have  special responsibilities and exist under special constraints that make implementing, measuring and improving performance more difficult. Our decision making strategy is based upon the “good news” that non-profit community grassroots organizations can use the a systematic five-step process for maximizing performance that has worked so well for organizations in the private sector.</p>
<p>We have developed  a  five-step process systematically that helps us to pinpoint the tasks that are most critical for organizational success, and to motivate people toward achieving maximum long-term performance on our  core tasks. The approach is applicable at a variety of levels, including individual performers, teams, units, and the organization as a whole.</p>
<p>Through case studies and simulations, the we use the process to address the issues  that may be helpful in getting the best results  in strategic decision making proccess  about our direction and future. As a grassroots process, this has seemed to work so far.</p>
<p>The RED RAIN is a case management service for street sex workers (female, male &amp; transgender), over 18yrs, who are not currently being case-managed, are HIV positive, or suffering from AIDS and related illness and are wanting to reduce the hours they work in the sex industry. In a country with high HIV prevalence, just like in the mainstream employment, many sex workers are not prepared to deal with the reality that one day they will not be able to work due to illness, and hence the need to prepare them for exit situations that are beyond their control. While we believe that it’s an individual choice to exit, we have to look at the realities that at one point some sex workers will be forced to retire due to matters beyond their control.</p>
<p>We have been going into the dangerous streets of Johannesburg since 2010, and we offer advice, education and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention tips to the street sex workers but we must admit the program does not generally help them to get out. It’s very difficult for street sex workers to adhere to the strict requirements of their medical obligations, i.e. taking medication regularly, going to healthy checkups, and they usually work in harsh weather conditions, which even makes their conditions worse, and sticking to diet requirements is also difficult as they work long hours.</p>
<p>It’s easy for people to say that if sex workers wanted to get out of the industry they could just walk away. They simply don't appreciate how hard it is. Sex workers live in a climate where extortion, blackmail and fear of physical abuse from former or current partners are an everyday reality; they are often socially isolated, and are terrified that family members will learn of their involvement in prostitution; on top of this, their mental health issues include depression, anxiety and self-harm.</p>
<p>We have been fortunate to witness a few sex workers exit street prostitution over the last two years, to live more healthy and fulfilling lives – but each time it was a gradual and long-term process, with high levels of support required. While it has taken much effort, not least from the sex workers themselves, we would say these outcomes have come about because their health and other associated issues were being properly addressed.</p>
<p>Our targets are street sex workers (female, male &amp; transgender), over 18yrs, who are not currently being case-managed, are HIV positive, or suffering from AIDS and related illness and are wanting to reduce the hours they work in the sex industry.</p>
<p>We have established that mostly sex workers in our target areas of Johannesburg enter  sex work for vast and varied reasons. Poverty, child abuse, living in state care, drug use and the influence of pimps and peer groups are definitely common themes. In most cases, economic necessity is by far the primary reason why a significantly large percentage of individuals began sex work. The majority of survival or, street-based sex workers have had negative experiences with mainstream social services and they feel judged and stigmatized when asking for aid.</p>
<p>If poverty or substance abuse remains as standing issues in their lives, the feeling of being “trapped” keeps them from making alternative choices. Sex workers who would not be classified as impoverished may benefit from the income, the relative independence, and the lifestyle but again may also be trapped due to the disassociation from the mainstream world.</p>
<p>It must be understood that exiting is a process, not an event. It is a culmination of experiences in a person’s life that contribute to their decision to exit. Therefore it will take a number of new experiences to help successfully facilitate it. Many sex workers leave the industry due to violence, reduced earning potential, drug dependence, or a desire for a better life. Many leave because they have had access to structured exiting supports and jobs that pay livable wages.</p>
<p>Exiting programs are aimed at expanding structural and relational supports and building capacities for change through the identification and mobilization of available assets and resources. Unfortunately, a successful exit from the sex trade is not solely dependent on individual traits such as a deep desire to leave. There are many “trapping” factors such as criminal records, the lack of resources for transition or the lack of available employment that undeniably plays a large role in sex worker exiting decisions and possibilities.</p>
<p>The process of exiting is typically fraught with starts and stops. On average, it can take 4-5 attempts before a sex worker feels sustainable in the mainstream world. This “yo-yoing” once again supports the need for strong relational factors and supports to encourage individual capacities and abilities for a successful exit. There may be an occurrence of a negative or a positive event that results in a sex worker desiring to exit such as a bad date or a potential healthy relationship. This reactionary mode may help the worker take steps in finding supports and reducing isolation. Some sex workers explore and weigh out alternatives to their current circumstance, an action that greatly contributes to accomplishing their goals in the “straight” world while others simply age-out where involvement in sex work comes to a natural end.</p>
<p>The stigma of the sex trade can brand the psyche of those in it and counseling, non-judgmental and experiential support are vital in helping former sex workers reclaim their lives.</p>
<p>Sex workers should be supported through the entire process of exiting, including instances where they have re-entered due to a lack of viable employment options. A holistic approach to programming is critical as it takes into account the interpersonal, social and structural factors that come onto play during transitioning. Much work is required with individuals and existing resources to create a continuum of services that support lasting change.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the stabilization of sex workers desiring to leave the trade is critical, especially in the area of HIV/AIDS illness. Without HIV/AIDS treatment, it is futile to strategize a long-term personal development plan for access into the mainstream world.</p>
<p><strong>We are looking for US$10 000.</strong></p>
<p>The money will be used to formalize our organisation to be a fully fledged legal entity, secure office space, and launch our first phase of our compaign.s</p>
<p>Should you donate US$5000 or, the campaign will be named in your honour. Otherwise any donor will be acknowledged on our wall of donors, and will be made honourary members of the organisation.</p>
<p>This funding will enable us to be able to have a large impact, and collaborate with government agencies such as hospitals and social development.  We will be able to ensure and monitor infected and sick sex workers stick to their treatment regimes. We will have a dedicated group of volunteers, receiving a stipend, who will execute their duties, and therefore make a large impact.</p>
<p>Many sex workers who want to exit because of their health situations, we will be able to assist them receive medical care they deserve, as well as their families, if they need home based care. We have seen a large number of sex workers who are abandoned by brothels and their pimps because they can’t work due to their ill health.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is insufficient funding available – with existing services being provided by dedicated people operating 'on a shoe string'. More services – and more effective ones – rely on more generous funding from organizations such as yours.</p>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>

Sex workers live in a climate where extortion, blackmail and fear of physical abuse from former or current partners are an everyday reality; they are often socially isolated, and are terrified that family members will learn of their involvement in prostitution; on top of this, their mental health issues include depression, anxiety and self-harm.
We have been fortunate to witness a few sex workers exit street prostitution over the last two years, to live more healthy and fulfilling lives – but each time it was a gradual and long-term process, with high levels of support required. While it has taken much effort, not least from the sex workers themselves, we would say these outcomes have come about because their health and other associated issues were being properly addressed.
Our targets are street sex workers (female, male & transgender), over 18yrs, who are not currently being case-managed, are HIV positive, or suffering from AIDS and related illness and are wanting to reduce the hours they work in the sex industry.
We have established that mostly sex workers in our target areas of Johannesburg enter  sex work for vast and varied reasons. Poverty, child abuse, living in state care, drug use and the influence of pimps and peer groups are definitely common themes. In most cases, economic necessity is by far the primary reason why a significantly large percentage of individuals began sex work. The majority of survival or, street-based sex workers have had negative experiences with mainstream social services and they feel judged and stigmatized when asking for aid.
If poverty or substance abuse remains as standing issues in their lives, the feeling of being “trapped” keeps them from making alternative choices. Sex workers who would not be classified as impoverished may benefit from the income, the relative independence, and the lifestyle but again may also be trapped due to the disassociation from the mainstream world.
It must be understood that exiting is a process, not an event. It is a culmination of experiences in a person’s life that contribute to their decision to exit. Therefore it will take a number of new experiences to help successfully facilitate it. Many sex workers leave the industry due to violence, reduced earning potential, drug dependence, or a desire for a better life. Many leave because they have had access to structured exiting supports and jobs that pay livable wages.
Exiting programs are aimed at expanding structural and relational supports and building capacities for change through the identification and mobilization of available assets and resources. Unfortunately, a successful exit from the sex trade is not solely dependent on individual traits such as a deep desire to leave. There are many “trapping” factors such as criminal records, the lack of resources for transition or the lack of available employment that undeniably plays a large role in sex worker exiting decisions and possibilities.
The process of exiting is typically fraught with starts and stops. On average, it can take 4-5 attempts before a sex worker feels sustainable in the mainstream world. This “yo-yoing” once again supports the need for strong relational factors and supports to encourage individual capacities and abilities for a successful exit. There may be an occurrence of a negative or a positive event that results in a sex worker desiring to exit such as a bad date or a potential healthy relationship. This reactionary mode may help the worker take steps in finding supports and reducing isolation. Some sex workers explore and weigh out alternatives to their current circumstance, an action that greatly contributes to accomplishing their goals in the “straight” world while others simply age-out where involvement in sex work comes to a natural end.
The stigma of the sex trade can brand the psyche of those in it and counseling, non-judgmental and experiential support are vital in helping former sex workers reclaim their lives.
Sex workers should be supported through the entire process of exiting, including instances where they have re-entered due to a lack of viable employment options. A holistic approach to programming is critical as it takes into account the interpersonal, social and structural factors that come onto play during transitioning. Much work is required with individuals and existing resources to create a continuum of services that support lasting change.
First and foremost, the stabilization of sex workers desiring to leave the trade is critical, especially in the area of HIV/AIDS illness. Without HIV/AIDS treatment, it is futile to strategize a long-term personal development plan for access into the mainstream world.
We are looking for US$10 000.
The money will be used to formalize our organisation to be a fully fledged legal entity, secure office space, and launch our first phase of our compaign.s
Should you donate US$5000 or, the campaign will be named in your honour. Otherwise any donor will be acknowledged on our wall of donors, and will be made honourary members of the organisation.
This funding will enable us to be able to have a large impact, and collaborate with government agencies such as hospitals and social development.  We will be able to ensure and monitor infected and sick sex workers stick to their treatment regimes. We will have a dedicated group of volunteers, receiving a stipend, who will execute their duties, and therefore make a large impact.
Many sex workers who want to exit because of their health situations, we will be able to assist them receive medical care they deserve, as well as their families, if they need home based care. We have seen a large number of sex workers who are abandoned by brothels and their pimps because they can’t work due to their ill health.
At the moment, there is insufficient funding available – with existing services being provided by dedicated people operating 'on a shoe string'. More services – and more effective ones – rely on more generous funding from organizations such as yours.
Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>July of 2011 I went to the clinic because my left foot was swollen and very sore. They didnt have time to see me and wanted me to come back for an appointment 3 days later. A doctor walked by and checked real quick and said take 1000mg of tylenol and 20 minutes later take 600 mg advil and keep your foot elevated until you get back for your appointment. Two days later I went to the emergency room in terrible pain and was admitted to the hospital. After a few hours I found myself surrouned by 4-5 Dr's and they rushed me to surgery. I had what they call Necrotizing Faciitis (flesh eating bacteria). This is fairly rare and can be fatal. Over the next ten days I went thru three surgeries and had my toes on my left foot removed. I spent thirty days in the hospital. Two months later my left foot was hurting really bad once again. I went to the Dr. that cut my toes off and they sent me directly to surgey once again fearing for my life. They amputated my left leg below the knee. Once again Necrotizing Faciitis had threatened my life. Ten days later I went home. There is no assistance out there for people in my position. Social security is trying to determine if I am disabled. I just want to walk again so I can start helping people.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have learned so much about our system and the political BS that goes on. How hard is it to see that I am disabled? Two years is how long they say it will take to get SSD.

I am going to make it my task to fight and expose this to the people and in the mean time help as many others that I can.(What is the impact your campaign may have on others?

Members of the Baltimore Student Harm Reduction Coalition (BSHRC) are a diverse network of students, health professionals, and community members who are committed to practicing and spreading harm reduction principles. To expand our work, we need $5000 to fund our exciting projects. Your contributions will support our diverse roles, from providing overdose prevention kits to engaging in state-level advocacy.
Harm Reduction is a way of thinking about drug use, sex work, and other conditions that may lead to harmful health consequences that accepts those things as fact and works with people to reduce their harm and celebrate their victories towards self defined goals. 
Since 2011, we have provided education, advocacy and service in the Baltimore area and beyond. Our vision is a world where harm reduction is a fundamental principle in improving health.
BSHRC is a program of local 501(c)3 fiscal sponsorship agency Fusion Partnerships, Inc.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hi everyone. Some of you know me through my art sites, at conventions I attenend, some have probably never met me - either way hello! A short introduction about why you are all here!</p>
<p>My name is Coey and I've been living as a trans man for the last 5 years, taking testosterone for 2 and already completed top surgery 4 years ago. Since being on testosterone you run the risk of getting cysts because your ovaries shut down. Normally this happens - but typically not in the first 5 years. I happen to be one of the exceptions, developing them quickly and in quite the unfortunate cluster. </p>
<p>I applied to have a hysterectomy and after getting the run around with insurance for a month and ultimately turned down because of a stupid loop hole they pulled. </p>
<p>This doesn't stop my need for the procedure and now forced to pay out of pocket. </p>
<p>That's where you all come in!</p>
<p>The surgery in combination with the hospital stay is going to be more than 25k, but I feel indebted enough to anyone willing to pitch in even a dollar that I'd want to raise the remaining amount through my freelance and commission work. I'm hoping that the combination of saving up myself, and this funding campaign I will achieve this goal sooner rather than the much-further-away later.</p>
<p>Either way the money will go towards my surgery but its just a matter of how long saving up on my end will take to compensate.</p>

<h3>My Story:</h3>
<p> My name is Edyn Blair, I am 25 and I have lived on my own since I was 18. That same year I began modeling. If you look through my photos you will very rarely ever see me smile. This is because if I do it takes editing to make it look adequate (like the photo attached)</p>
<p>Ever since I was little I have had soft teeth which has led to many fillings and the removal of 2 of my molars over the years. My teeth because of thier softness have even with bleaching been yellow and have now developed calcium deposits at the base and again have fillings that have fallen out and root canals that need to be done. Last week at the Dentist I was told that if I didn't start in process to have the calcium deposits removed, get new fillings, crowns and sealant that within 8 months time my body will start to reject the calcium deposits which, with it being attached to my teeth like cement, will push my teeth out with it and I could begin to lose some of my front teeth and continue from there. Essentially if I am unable to get these fixes I will be in dentures by the time I am 30.</p>
<p>I am a full time student and have a 2 day a week job. I am looking for another. Modeling while fun and while its going well for me doesn't pay unless a company hires you for a campaign. I shoot with show cars and do some promotional work that is paid. But still, I can't afford or get insurance and because I don't make enough money I can't get financing for the surgeries I need. I sold many of my antiques and am in the process of selling my car for money to pay for the surgeries.</p>
<p>I eat well, I work out, I take care of myself. This unfortunately, was inevitable.</p>
<p>I can't ask my family for help because those that are able are paying for my younger sisters pregnancy and medical costs. So I have no other options.</p>
<p>I don't like to ask for help, I pride myself on being able to do things on my own. But I am asking now. Anything helps.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My costs:</p>
<p>I am getting the work done at LaFevers Dental is Goldsboro, NC</p>
<p>It will be a 9 visit process that start with a full cleaning and examination of the depth of some of the holes of my teeth. This continues into root canals, scaling, and drilling out the calcium deposits at the root of many of my teeth. This is all finished up with crowns on the top 6 front teeth and sealing of the rest of my teeth to keep this from happening again.</p>
<p>The overall cost of the surgery is roughly $11,000.00 But I am just trying to pay for $5000 of it because I don't want to ask for more. The money donated here will give me time so save up my own money to pay for the rest of the work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>I am willing to trade photoshoots for photographers in NC, I also will send anyone that donates a signed poster and personal thank you card. And also a thank you via facebook. If you have a dog and Donate at least $30 visit my etsy store at caninecharm.etsy.com and order a custom collar for your dog. any size. Unfortunately that is all I can do, I wish there was more.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal of $5000 the funds that are raised will go towards the dental work regardless.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

To really smile. To actually bite into apples, corn on the cob and hard food without fear of cracking, loosening or chipping my teeth.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will actually be able to smile without someone asking if I have something stuck in my teeth because they notice the black hole in the front of my mouth.</div>

<h3>A Little Bit About Us</h3>
<p>The Meus Productions is a Canadian company that began as a platform upon which to create films that are educational and have mainstream appeal while showcasing local talent. Over the last 10 years, The Meus Productions has expanded to become a successful producer of local theatre and film, concurrently discovering and training new and fresh local talent.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>The Meus Productions, in conjunction with Rogers TV, are producing a new lifestyle television show about organic food. Its Organic Baby will focus primarily on mainstream food and its organic, easily prepared counterparts. The show is based upon the ever growing interest in the ramifications of eating food that is not organically grown and the methods open to families for the preparation of viable organic alternatives while showcasing and exposing their potential sources. We request the amount of five thousand dollars ($5000.00) to accomplish and complete the pilot project. The funds requested will be used for a variety of expenses such as equipment, costumes, dedicated crew, shoot location, website and actors.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span>Help us support parents and early years groups by providing information to promote a balanced diet for children. A good diet is particularly important for young children as early food experiences will impact on eating patterns and habits in their adult life.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're accepting contributions in various amounts, from $5 to $1000.  However, we understand that times are hard, and parting with funds may not always be easy.  Please know that you can also support by helping us promote:</p>
<p>Word of mouth is the best kind of advertising, and things like Facebook, Twitter &amp; Pinterest make it even easier.  Send e-mails sharing our links, and tell your friends and co-workers about all our hard work on this project! Please help spread the word about It's Organic Baby! Hoping to promote healthy lunches in schools worldwide starting with Ottawa. </p>
<p>Indiegogo has great tools for sharing projects that are quick and simple....check those out!</p>
<p>Have a cooking blog? Please share our story and/or review our shades! Contact lisameuser@themeusproductions.ca for more info.</p>
<p>If you own a restaurtant or a farm or organic grocery store or are a distributor and want to partner with us, please contact lisameuser@themeusproductions.ca We would love to work with mom &amp; pop stores, especially if you are willing to help with our charitable cause!!</p>

Help us support parents and early years groups by providing information to promote a balanced diet for children. A good diet is particularly important for young children as early food experiences will impact on eating patterns and habits in their adult life.

<p>Friends, my name is Katya, and I received my 200 hour yoga instructor certification almost 4 years ago in New York City with an amazing teacher named Crissy Carter at YogaWorks. It was Chrissy who got me hooked on ""intelligent instruction,"" an approach to teaching yoga that as I see it comes from deep reverence for the power available in this practice, respect for the teacher/student dynamic, keen awareness of keeping the student safe within the practice, and a dedication for dissolving the obstacles of the ego that can hinder a fluid experience of yoga. </p>
<p>I teach yoga because it has saved my life more than once. Through dark nights of the soul, degenerating stress and, once, teetering physical health, the deep, ever-evolving practice of yoga has been the ladder that has presented itself an pulled me back into balance. And I see it do the same for my students, all of whom, like many people these days for so many reasons, are going through extreme times and seeing many of their safety structures crumbling. </p>
<p>I've studied many modes of therapy, and this happens to be the one that I feel I have something to offer in. </p>
<p>As a teacher, one of the most important practices for me is perpetually being a student. I can only teach as long as I am expanding in the knowledge myself, and at this point in my practice I am aware that there is still so, so much I don't know. I would like to help my students get out of chronic pain, and practice safely, and in order to truly keep them safe, I need more knowledge. </p>
<p>I am lucky enough to have found a training that promises to build on the knowledge that I already have in the specific ways that I am looking for, and one that will launch me directly into the sphere of therapeutic yoga that I am interested in. In addition, it's local - which is huge for me as a single parent - and takes place on a schedule that I can work with (again, challenging as a single parent). </p>
<p>While I don't have the funds to pay for it out of pocket, and there aren't any scholarships available, I want to believe that it's possible to attend the soonest training, coming up in January. Any help towards this goal will be so monumentally appreciated, much more than I can say. </p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>Specifically, I need to raise $1300 to cover the full cost of this training. The training itself is called ""The Art of Teaching Yoga in the Iyengar Tradition"" and is being offered through Blue Spruce Yoga in Lakewood, CO. If you are interested, you can find out all the details at bluespruceyoga.com. </p>
<p>If I don't reach the entire funding goal, I will look for ways to fill any remaining gap. Whether or not I am able to make it to this year's training, any funding that's gleaned from this project will go toward making it to this training as soon as I can in the future! </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>So why should you contribute funds to grow yet another yoga instructor on this planet? Well, first, I won't tell you that you should. But I will say that with every highly trained, skillful yoga instructor that emerges in the field, the entire yoga culture gets lifted to a new level, a new standard is set, and the instruction that you can expect to get when you scout out a yoga class has a higher chance of being of excellent quality. </p>
<p>Okay, I know the value of yoga has gotten watered down and diminished in the past decades, but consider that the ego tends to hijack everything - and the best things seem to experience the worst hijacking. It seems to be a law of the universe. </p>
<p>SO with yoga, as with anything else that first becomes glamorized and then starts to feel superficial, the hijacking does not reflect the value of the thing itself. This is still a deeply profound practice with the potency to dramatically shift people's lives. </p>
<p>It's also one of the simplest, most accessible ways to adjust imbalances of all kinds. And it truly is available and accessible to anyone, in some form. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>My clearest and biggest challenge to achieving this is definitely the monetary aspect. I've already gotten the green light from the lead instructor that my experience level is appropriate for the training, and all other pieces are malleable enough. </p>

</h3><p>Our young family member Celeste
Chartrand was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis just three weeks after her birth on January 1, 2009. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is incurable, and is the most common fatal
genetic condition for Canadian children and youth. Without proper treatment and management of their disease, children with CF can easily develop serious lung damage and eventually lose their lung function.   </p>
<p>We do not want this to happen to Celeste. Today, she is
5 years old and with the love and support of her family, is doing the best she can to manage her disease. She  has had 3 times as many hospital visits than
the average child of her age. She must take 15-20 pills a day to make it possible for her small body to digest and absorb nutrients from food. One of the effects of CF is that it makes the mucus in Celeste's breathing passages dangerously thick and sticky, which leaves her at high risk for lung infections, the primary cause of death for people living with CF. To prevent this, Celeste does multiple breathing treatments each day, and spends an additional hour each day in physical therapy that is sometimes painful, but helps clear her lungs of the thick mucus.  </p><p>Celeste started junior kindergarten this year. In spite of all the hard work to keep her as well as possible, she was only able to attend 28 days of her first year of school. </p>

<br/></div>","Our young family member Celeste
Chartrand was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis just three weeks after her birth on January 1, 2009. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is incurable, and is the most common fatal
genetic condition for Canadian children and youth. Without proper treatment and management of their disease, children with CF can easily develop serious lung damage and eventually lose their lung function.   
We do not want this to happen to Celeste. Today, she is
5 years old and with the love and support of her family, is doing the best she can to manage her disease. She  has had 3 times as many hospital visits than
the average child of her age. She must take 15-20 pills a day to make it possible for her small body to digest and absorb nutrients from food. One of the effects of CF is that it makes the mucus in Celeste's breathing passages dangerously thick and sticky, which leaves her at high risk for lung infections, the primary cause of death for people living with CF. To prevent this, Celeste does multiple breathing treatments each day, and spends an additional hour each day in physical therapy that is sometimes painful, but helps clear her lungs of the thick mucus.  Celeste started junior kindergarten this year. In spite of all the hard work to keep her as well as possible, she was only able to attend 28 days of her first year of school. 

Vest For Celeste Fundraiser
We want Celeste to have the best life possible. Our dream is that next year, when Celeste heads off to school, she'll be able to stay for the day and stay for the year. As Celeste's extended family, we are trying to raise funds for Celeste and her family so that they will be able to buy medical equipment that will help make that possible: a Vest Airway Clearance System. We have set up this fundraiser because we know that this medical equipment will change Celeste's life. The vest system will improve airway clearance and lung function and, for Celeste, will mean less pain, fewer lung infections, less antibiotics and fewer hospital visits. With the vest, she will be able to attend school, lead a fuller and more fun life, and extend her life expectancy. We are trying to raise $15,200 to purchase the equipment. This will cover the actual cost of the vest system (CA$14,136) and the cost of running our campaign on Indiegogo (CA$1,064). Our family members and friends will contribute what they can, but we need everyone's help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Meet Elsie.  Elsie has Cerebral Palsy, Optic Nerve Athrophy (severe visual impairment), and Epilepsy, along with other medical and physical issues such as Cerebral Folate Deficiency, Mid-Foot Breakdown, Contractures, and a host of behavioral issues.  Elsie is also non-verbal and struggles with communicating her needs and wants.  </p>
<p>Elsie is a determined, sweet, playful, and capable seven year old girl.  As a result of her disabilities and medications, she is also  frustrated, weak, impatient, and in many ways imprisoned inside her own body.  Her frustrations often manifest with anger, giggles, and silly or unsafe behaviors making daily care, activities, and theraputic rehabilitation very difficult.</p>
<p>Elsie recently underwent a significant surgical procedure on October 3, 2013, called a Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy.  This procedure has eliminated Elsie's muscle spacticity in her lower extremities, and should allow her to walk independently in a walker one day, but comes with a year of daily physical rehabiliation to regain strength, of which insurance only covers a small portion. We have already seen significant improvements in her leg movement patterns since the surgery.   Elsie will also undergo a second surgery in December to lengthen the tendons in her legs that were not able to keep up with her growth as the force of spacticity pulled on them each day.  </p>
<p>Elsie spent the first two months of her rehabiliation in St. Louis, a 9 hour drive from home, so that she could work with the team of doctors and therapist that specialize in this procedure.  While at rehab each day, the therapists struggled to motivate Elsie to participate in each activity that would help her to regain strength.  As a way to escape the difficult work ahead, Elsie would try to bite, hit, scream, and relax her body as she fell into a heap on the floor giggling hysterically. </p>
<p>Enter THE BIKE!  </p>
<p>Elsie began arriving at therapy each day and would immediately ask for the bike with her word approximation of ""Bi!""  Through the use of a hard-work-timer and a built in reward on the bike, Elsie began completing some really difficult exercises and made significant progress.  She began using her walker to walk with assistance up and down the hallways of the hospital, knowing when she reached her selected duration, she would get a ride on the bike.  As she progressed in her rehabilitation, the bike not only became a reward, but a theraputic tool.  Each day, the therapists could feel Elsie using more and more of her own strength to push the pedals.  Two days before heading back to her hometown, Elsie began to independently pedal the bike 3 to 4 cycles at a time (see video insert). </p>
<p>Most of what Elsie does each day requires one on one support - dressing, toileting, teeth brushing, eating, sitting, taking a few steps in a walker.  Elsie has always been motivated by her independence, often physically pushing away helping hands and assistance, as if to say, ""I'll do it myself!""  This bicycle has given Elsie an independence that she craves with the ability to move all on her own.  It also gives her the ability to participate in outdoor walks with her family, interact with other children on the street, and will continue to therapuetically strengthen her muscles at the same time.</p>
<p>The adaptive bicycle is a Freedom Concepts Discovery 16 Series.  This bike is adjustable and can be used by Elsie from now through the next 7 years.  <a href=""http://www.freedomconcepts.com/fc_products/f3-bike-series/discovery-series/dcp-16/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.freedomconcepts.com/fc_products/f3-bike-series/discovery-series/dcp-16/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.freedomconcepts.com/fc_products/f3-b...</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Freedom Concepts Discovery 16 is the one of best adaptive bicycles on the market.  The unique control handle allows her parents or therapists to offer assistance to Elsie when she needs and to help her steer her when she gets off course.  The bike comes with many adjustable features so that as Elsie's skills improve, the bike can grow with Elsie.</p>
<p>The Freedom Concept 16"" Discovery is listed at $4,950. </p>
<p>The funds will go directly to purchasing Elsie's adaptive bike.  As a donor, you would have the knowledge that a bright and beautiful child who faces so many daily obstacles and challenges, will now have more independence that she so deeply desires.<br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p></p></div>","Cancer affects everyone. Whether you have cancer or you're watching a loved one fight - the stress associated with cancer can be felt by all.The Seats For Survivors program was created to give cancer patients/survivors and caregivers a brief - but much needed escape away from treatment to enjoy a movie at no cost to them and provide a beneficial experience of happiness with others who are also facing cancer. The Story:How Seats for Survivors came to beIt all started when Ginger Johnson, a young mother and fitness instructor, was blindsided by a breast cancer diagnosis at the age of 31 years old when 5 months pregnant.  Her journey took her through a mastectomy surgery at 6 months pregnant, delivering a healthy baby boy at full term and then having 3 additional surgeries before beginning chemo when her newborn was just weeks old. Her husband and two older children watched as she began down the path that most people dread:Hours of chemotherapy; radiation; disfiguring surgeries; unfamiliar side effects, financial burdens and feelings of severe frustration – all wrapped together in one big mess of unexpected and undesired events that often leave people feeling alone and misunderstood.To combat the negativity, she began gathering prizes for patients during her 'good days' in between treatments and then giving them to the patients in her infusion room with a wish of 'Happy Chemo!' She continued this service through her entire treatment and for years afterwards as her father was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer only a few months after she completed her treatments.  Today HappyChemo.com is the continuation of this endeavor.Seeing the sheer frustration and desire for normalcy in the eyes of those she served and listening to their desperate need for some type of break, the Seats for Survivors program was created to give survivors and caregivers a night off from cancer.A time where they could come together – not for treatment – but for a fun night out to sit back, relax and enjoy a show in a local movie theater at not cost to them; making memories with the ones they love. Making A DifferenceTo date, we have been able to provide seats for over 1,000 patients/survivors and caregivers to attend local movie, theatrical and sporting events and now we're ready to take Seats for Survivors across the nation! This is what people are saying:“We can’t say ‘Thank You’ enough. This was the first break we’ve had in a long time since his treatment began and it was wonderful to see him laugh again. Thank you!” ~ Dianne H., caregiver“Talk about an enjoyable evening.

Mold and its invisible spores are literally everywhere on visible surfaces, behind wall cavities, in basements, attics, cupboards, wardrobes, under carpets, indoor mold grows when there is moisture. Along with mold in these indoor environments are bacteria, dust and mites. As mold spreads it releases spores and VOC’s (volatile organic compounds) and they are the cause of the bad odours and mustiness. Mold along with bacteria and dust mites have now been identified to have direct health effects in humans, including many types of allergies and infections and should raise alarms bells for those people that wish to maintain their health.</p><p><b>Is There A Difference Between Molds and Fungi?</b></p><p>Molds are fungi. Fungi reproduce by means of spores which are spread through the air but land and survive on surfaces. In the indoor environment there are a multitude of places for mold spores to grow, populate and spread. Air conditioners, window condensation, leaky plumbing, bathrooms, air filters, wet outside walls and indoor plants.1 Common indoor mold species include Aspergillus, Alternaria, Acremonium, Cladosporum, Dreschslera, Epicoccum, Penicillium, Stachybotrys, and Trichoderma.2</p><p><b>What Are the Health Effects with Exposure to Indoor Mold?</b></p><p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the average American spends 93% of their life indoors. 87% of their life is indoors, then another 6% of their life in automobiles. It is no wonder that many people complain of respiratory effects, headaches, and other physical symptoms. The secondary flow on effect is when the surfaces that the mold has been growing on start to break-down this is when dust mites, bacteria, and chemicals, gasses, and particulate matter are released from the building materials and structures on which molds are growing.</p><p>The Institute of Medicine (IOM In 2004 report,) found that being in damp indoor spaces related to common respiratory illnesses: asthma symptoms, nose and throat symptoms, coughing and wheezing. They also found some evidence that these environments can be associated with shortness of breath, the development of asthma in people who did not previously suffer from it, and coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath in healthy children. There was enough evidence of health effects overall, that IOM identified damp indoor spaces as a public health problem that needs to be addressed.3</p><p><b>Mold Publications </b></p><p>Indoor mold could be confirmed as a cause of ill health and respiratory illnesses. Researchers noted that controlling mold in indoor air spaces would make a substantial contribution to the general public’s health. Bush and colleagues have state definitively that mold exposure is capable of causing illness in humans. They summarize three mechanisms: harmful immune responses, e.g. allergies or the uncommon occurrence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis; infections; and irritation from mold by-products.10 The author Terr acknowledges four types of allergy caused by inhaling mold spores, including asthma and a type of sinusitis.4 In another paper by Fisk and colleagues where they reviewed thirty-three studies to assess the risk of health effects of people who spent time in mold environments. Subjects were adults and children. They found that upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, wheeze, and asthma were more frequent in people who spent time in spaces with mold present.5</p><p><b>Mold and Children </b></p><p>The report by Antova which focused on studies children aged six to twelve from 10 found that mold in the household correlated with a variety of respiratory disorders, including wheezing, coughing at night, and allergic symptoms and hay fever.6 Where visible mold was in the primary living areas Karvonen showed that the first eighteen months of life, wheezing was more common in the homes and this study group involved 396 children.7 In 2011, Reponen and colleagues published a study of 176 children followed from birth through age seven. A research tool developed and being evaluated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)8 was used to assess the children's homes in a 2011 published study by Reponen from birth to age seven. 11 This study using the EPA guidelines demonstrated that these young children who lived in homes with higher levels of mold at age one were more likely than other children to have asthma by the age of seven. It does provide evidence that reducing the amount of mold in infants' homes is beneficial to health.</p><p><b>Allergies and Asthma </b></p><p>Though numerous studies established the presence of dampness and mold with respiratory allergies and asthma and now it is possible to assess and treat individuals who have symptoms of respiratory allergies and asthma. Khalili and colleagues emphasize that determining whether respiratory symptoms are related to mold exposure involves a process of elimination. Once other possible causes of respiratory symptoms have been ruled out, patients can be assessed for the possibility of mold-induced illness.9</p><p><b>References</b></p><p>1-Kim, JJ, Mazur LJ, American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Environmental Health.

Bush and colleagues have state definitively that mold exposure is capable of causing illness in humans. They summarize three mechanisms: harmful immune responses, e.g. allergies or the uncommon occurrence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis; infections; and irritation from mold by-products.10 The author Terr acknowledges four types of allergy caused by inhaling mold spores, including asthma and a type of sinusitis.4 In another paper by Fisk and colleagues where they reviewed thirty-three studies to assess the risk of health effects of people who spent time in mold environments. Subjects were adults and children. They found that upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, wheeze, and asthma were more frequent in people who spent time in spaces with mold present.5Mold and Children The report by Antova which focused on studies children aged six to twelve from 10 found that mold in the household correlated with a variety of respiratory disorders, including wheezing, coughing at night, and allergic symptoms and hay fever.6 Where visible mold was in the primary living areas Karvonen showed that the first eighteen months of life, wheezing was more common in the homes and this study group involved 396 children.7 In 2011, Reponen and colleagues published a study of 176 children followed from birth through age seven. A research tool developed and being evaluated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)8 was used to assess the children's homes in a 2011 published study by Reponen from birth to age seven. 11 This study using the EPA guidelines demonstrated that these young children who lived in homes with higher levels of mold at age one were more likely than other children to have asthma by the age of seven. It does provide evidence that reducing the amount of mold in infants' homes is beneficial to health.Allergies and Asthma Though numerous studies established the presence of dampness and mold with respiratory allergies and asthma and now it is possible to assess and treat individuals who have symptoms of respiratory allergies and asthma. Khalili and colleagues emphasize that determining whether respiratory symptoms are related to mold exposure involves a process of elimination. Once other possible causes of respiratory symptoms have been ruled out, patients can be assessed for the possibility of mold-induced illness.9References1-Kim, JJ, Mazur LJ, American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Environmental Health.

Screens vision for 20/20 to 20/400 in under 3 minutes, providing exact measures of single and dual eye performance
Creates a digital vision history where a change indicates that a doctor’s visit would be advised 
Tests your current glasses or contacts to determine if an updated prescription may be required
Instantly records and securely stores results, making data available to track and share with others
One EyeQue Insight can be shared with many people, making it a value for families and suitable for testing large groups
Runs in two modes, simple straightforward ""adult"" mode, and gamified ""kids"" mode for children
The self-administered test is super EASY (just swipe in the direction of the “E”) and FAST(under 3 minutes for right eye, left eye, AND both eyes), the randomized and gamified experience ensures that everyone stays engaged. Test results are instantly stored in the EyeQue Cloud™ to help you keep track of vision changes over time.Use the Insight to check your current glasses or contactsVisual acuity is a fancy term used to describe clarity and sharpness of vision. If someone sees 20/20 that means he/she has normal vision as defined by optometrists. If, for example, someone has a 20/40 visual acuity, it means that ""he/she must stand 20 feet from an object to see what someone with perfect vision can see from 40 feet away,"" hence less than perfect visual acuity.We won the Indiegogo x HSN ""American Dreams"" Pitch Competition! Hundreds of start ups were considered, 10 were chosen to give the pitch, and we WON! This means we're in the process of getting ourselves some SHOW TIME on HSN! Here are some of our favorite moments and footages. Order now for the best price ($89 preorder vs $129.99 MSPR)! A FULL DEMO by our team, posted by HSN: see it here! Everyone who came by the booth received a demo on the Insight and were given instant results!

<h3>Divinity Foundation is organising another medical camp starting in September.</h3>
<p>""Divinity Foundation is a 
private Humanitarian Aid Organization founded by Osteopathic 
Practitioner, Nav Matharu. They empower and offer support to Orphaned, 
Abandoned and Impoverished children and mothers in selected global 
regions through our Healthcare, Education and Food Aid programs""</p>
<p>""<span>Each
 year large teams of volunteer osteopaths, nurses, doctors, educators 
and students get together 3-4 times a year to run two weeks of free mobile 
medical camps which sees the team working in the slums, in city charity 
hospitals, orphanages and in rural bush lands under the shades of trees.<span>  During the camps free checkups, treatment and basic medicines are supplied. A two week programme costs us £5000 / $8000 </span>An estimated 4000 children and mothers are treated for FREE during each two week camp. </span></p>
<p><span>Children
 are primarily treated by osteopathic treatment and first response 
medications are used to treat conditions such as: Ringworm, chest 
infections, dehydration, eye infections and malaria.</span></p>
<p><span>This project is named <strong>“Healing Angels”</strong>
 in honour of all the volunteers from Europe and USA that make the 
medical out-reach programme possible through volunteering their time and
 skills to help impoverished people.""</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<b><h3>We now urgently need:<br/>
</h3></b><p></p>
<p>some cash to be able to pay for the extra luggage filled with clothes donated in Switzerland, and are very much hoping to be able to deliver them all to the kids we are going to meet there.</p>
<p>The airline doesn't provide us with any extra luggage allowance and we have over 150kg to bring over to Kenya.</p>
<p>Along with the osteopathic and medical treatment the children will receive throughout the camp, we would be really happy to be able to give them some piece of clothing. As you can see on video, most of them are lacking proper clothing, which is even more important, considering that most of them are street kids / orpheans.</p>
<p>We did think until the very last minute that the airline would make a gesture and be accommodating for some extra kg, but we are now running out of time. That is why we are now asking for your help and contributions.<br/></p>
<br/><h3>We have put a higher target</h3>than the one needed to pay for the sending of the clothing, thinking that if there is any cash left, we would be happy to give it to Divinity Foundation's founder, Nav Matharu, in order to help the foundation with their new project, the Rescue Center for girls.<br/><br/><p></p>

<h3>Please don't hesitate to visit ""Divinity Foundation's"" Facebook page, and spread the word around you.</h3>

Abandoned and Impoverished children and mothers in selected global 
regions through our Healthcare, Education and Food Aid programs""
""Each
 year large teams of volunteer osteopaths, nurses, doctors, educators 
and students get together 3-4 times a year to run two weeks of free mobile 
medical camps which sees the team working in the slums, in city charity 
hospitals, orphanages and in rural bush lands under the shades of trees.  During the camps free checkups, treatment and basic medicines are supplied. A two week programme costs us £5000 / $8000 An estimated 4000 children and mothers are treated for FREE during each two week camp. 
Children
 are primarily treated by osteopathic treatment and first response 
medications are used to treat conditions such as: Ringworm, chest 
infections, dehydration, eye infections and malaria.
This project is named “Healing Angels”
 in honour of all the volunteers from Europe and USA that make the 
medical out-reach programme possible through volunteering their time and
 skills to help impoverished people.""

We now urgently need:

some cash to be able to pay for the extra luggage filled with clothes donated in Switzerland, and are very much hoping to be able to deliver them all to the kids we are going to meet there.
The airline doesn't provide us with any extra luggage allowance and we have over 150kg to bring over to Kenya.
Along with the osteopathic and medical treatment the children will receive throughout the camp, we would be really happy to be able to give them some piece of clothing. As you can see on video, most of them are lacking proper clothing, which is even more important, considering that most of them are street kids / orpheans.
We did think until the very last minute that the airline would make a gesture and be accommodating for some extra kg, but we are now running out of time. That is why we are now asking for your help and contributions.
We have put a higher targetthan the one needed to pay for the sending of the clothing, thinking that if there is any cash left, we would be happy to give it to Divinity Foundation's founder, Nav Matharu, in order to help the foundation with their new project, the Rescue Center for girls.

Please don't hesitate to visit ""Divinity Foundation's"" Facebook page, and spread the word around you.
There will be regular updates and pictures on the Facebook page during the camp.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Lilo is a happy. fun-loving and energetic 5-year-old girl. She was born in 2007 in South Korea, when both her mother and father were teaching. After a year and a  half, it was apparent something was seriously wrong. While living in Istanbul, Turkey, Lilo was given a provisional diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Her father left his job to come back to Canada to be with her as a full-time, single dad. </p>
<p>In the course of 2 years, Lilo was diagnosed as ""severely autistic"". She could not speak, would not respond to verbal/physical prompts and the prognosis was not good. It appeared that the family would be working towards teaching basic life skills in order to one day, hopefully facilitate her living in a group home. </p>
<p>Since that time, Lilo has astounded everyone. With the tireless effort from her father by her side, working through every imagineable form of behaviour and speech therapy, Lilo has flourished. She is just about to finish her junior year of kindergarten, with minimal in-class assistance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Lilo has met nearly every socialization and behavioural goal set out for her last September. She is very social and happy and is now facing more difficulties, as she wants to play and interact with other children but is often teased, left out or ignored because of her limitations in speech and language. </p>
<p>There is an expensive speech/language summer camp that would greatly benefit Lilo, going back into kindergarten. Her father is in receipt of social assitance and cannot afford the $3000 price tag associated with the therapy program.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lilo is destined for greatness. She has overcome so much so soon and the world is hers for the taking. We are all trying to help her get all of the assistance we can to give her the best chance and to maximize her potential.</p>

<p>Hello, World,</p>
<p>My name is Jonathan Mullins. I'm a 29 y/o personal trainer, professional actor and music producer. I come from a very healthy background in terms of fitness. I’ve pretty much been an athlete all my life. I've competed nationally in different areas of sports. I earned the title Marine in the summer of 2001. Hence the name Marine Jon Fitness (<a href=""http://www.marinejonfit.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.marinejonfit.com</a>)</p>
<p>My campaign is to raise money for a fitness bootcamp in Central Park this summer! If you understand the importance of fitness like I do, and you have a passion for people, then this totally makes sense. Plus, a lot of people love to do bootcamp. </p>
<p>I have gotten heavily involved in fitness, and after seeing the difference I have made in the lives of many, it just makes me want to do more on a bigger scale.  I want to continue being a difference-maker who motivates people and helps them understand eating right and daily exercise are critical to health and well-being.  My own mother is the reason I do what I do. If I knew years ago what I know now, my mother would be in better physical condition.  So, taking a lesson from my own life, I am compelled to not only put on a bootcamp, but to also take care of my mother and her health.</p>
<p>The magnitude of what you help me achieve will be the greatest gift anyone can ask for – just plain good health.  By also offering fitness in a fun-filled environment, the impact this bootcamp has on people will stick with the people participating in  the bootcamp and will have a ripple effect:  it will help build people on all different levels – physical, emotional, and mental. </p>
<p>Different people need motivation in different ways.  This bootcamp is a great way to accomplish that.  Your small contribution will be one among that helps me provide an unforgettable experience, growth and change in the lives of many.</p>
<p>The bootcamp will be offered first-come, first-served.  There will be slots for 50 people per class. (2 SESSIONS!) MORNING AND AFTERNOON! This is what I need to make the vision a reality.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is Steve Meyerink, I am married to the most wonderful girl in the world, Kari. We have been married for 7 wonderful years. Kari has an immune system disorder. This illness has destroyed parts of her immune system that fight off illnesses. At our last appointment with her immunologist he told us that her illness was getting worse and more parts were failing. The doctor looked me in the eye and said "" you are going to lose your wife to this"". They are the hardest words I have ever heard spoken to me.</div>
<div>Kari gets life saving medicine every two weeks that makes her very sick, very tired and she has debilitating pain in her joints and muscles. These symptoms last for 5 to 7 days after the infusion. During her recovery time she takes refuge in our home. Over the past 5 years Kari has spent hundreds of days in hospitals in Nebraska, Minnesota, and California.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your generosity will help us to keep our home from falling into forclosure and give Kari a place to find sanctuary from the pain that her illness causes her both physically and emotionally. Kari lost her job and feels that she is not doing her part to help with the bills, but meeting our goal and actually paying off our home will help her feel better and not worry every month of how we are going to pay all our bills. Meeting our goal of paying our home off will allow Kari to focus more on staying as healthy as she can as her illness progresses.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Steve Meyerink, I am married to the most wonderful girl in the world, Kari. We have been married for 7 wonderful years. Kari has an immune system disorder. This illness has destroyed parts of her immune system that fight off illnesses. At our last appointment with her immunologist he told us that her illness was getting worse and more parts were failing. The doctor looked me in the eye and said "" you are going to lose your wife to this"". They are the hardest words I have ever heard spoken to me.
Kari gets life saving medicine every two weeks that makes her very sick, very tired and she has debilitating pain in her joints and muscles. These symptoms last for 5 to 7 days after the infusion. During her recovery time she takes refuge in our home. Over the past 5 years Kari has spent hundreds of days in hospitals in Nebraska, Minnesota, and California. Sometimes her pain is so bad we have to go to the Emergency Room to get it all under control.
Kari and I bought 5 acres of her fathers pasture and put the home of our dreams on it. Kari and I put our hearts and our souls into the design and building of our home. The colors, the shapes and the layout were picked out by both of us.
Due to Kari losing her job we are now on the verge of losing our home due to our medical bills, and our monthly mortgage payment adjusting to a higher rate. Kari's infusions cost over $30,000 per month and although we have insurance that covers 70/30, and it doesn't cover the out of pocket expenses, copays, and any other costs. My paycheck doesn't cover all of our monthly expenses so we have had to turn to credit cards and loans just to stay ahead.
Our home is where our roots are, its where our hearts are, and it is where Kari can recover from the side effects of her medical condition in peace and quiet.

What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for $3000 as a goal in hopes of reaching it and passing it. Our home loan is nearly $210,000, we hope that the generosity of people will get us to that amount so we do not have to worry about losing our home.
Your generosity will help us to keep Kari in a place she calls home with her family and recovers from the debilitating side effects of medicine and waits for the time to say goodbye. We have many travel expences as some of Kari's doctors are hundreds of miles away in Nebraska and others are even further in California.

The Impact
Your generosity will help us to keep our home from falling into forclosure and give Kari a place to find sanctuary from the pain that her illness causes her both physically and emotionally. Kari lost her job and feels that she is not doing her part to help with the bills, but meeting our goal and actually paying off our home will help her feel better and not worry every month of how we are going to pay all our bills.

<p></p>
<p>We are an Italian web company and we usually deal with music and digital entertainment. Death is a subject quite far from our business and thoughts.</p>
<p>Apparently.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The more you grow up, the more you find yourself visiting a cemetery and walking among tombostones with a grandfather telling stories about people passed away. Stories we would have never know without our grandparents. This is why we decided to start Rest in memory, a project to save memories of entire lives. No matter if the stories are about heroes or common people, because each family deserves its stories to be told and kept alive.</span></p>
<p>
Rest in Memory is our contribution to save these memories, using mobile and web technologies to let each tombstone become ""accessible"" with a smartphone and able to show people's photos and tales.

Website: http://www.restinmemory.com
Why

We are an Italian web company and we usually deal with music and digital entertainment. Death is a subject quite far from our business and thoughts.
Apparently.
The more you grow up, the more you find yourself visiting a cemetery and walking among tombostones with a grandfather telling stories about people passed away. Stories we would have never know without our grandparents. This is why we decided to start Rest in memory, a project to save memories of entire lives. No matter if the stories are about heroes or common people, because each family deserves its stories to be told and kept alive.

Rest in Memory is our contribution to save these memories, using mobile and web technologies to let each tombstone become ""accessible"" with a smartphone and able to show people's photos and tales. 


What We Need & What You Get
We need 5000 Euros to cover all start up costs:



first 250 marble RIM (Rest In Memory) tiles


print and NFC microchip tagging process


deluxe packaging


web design, software development and server


video


press




If we reach the target you will help up to go ahead the italian taboo of death :-) and you'll get an easy way to keep alive the tales of your family.
Because all stories even the simplest ones have something important to tell us like in the book of Edgar Lee Masters ""Spoon River Anthology"" and all together give us the sense of a community .
We trust a lot our project, so if we don't reach the target here we will go on and complete the fund by ourselves. Everyone who will trust us will receive its RIM tile.

<li>We want to offer our Medical &amp; Motivation Account as a FREE iOS app for a better &amp; more effective user experience.</li>
<li>We need to raise $12,000 in 30 days to pay for the app development to complete this goal - it's all about coding now!</li>
<li>The Medical &amp; Motivation Account offers more than the traditional health apps acting only as electronic file cabinets. </li>
<li>Yes, the Medical &amp; Motivational Account can store the important, concrete details of your health. </li>
<li>The Medical &amp; Motivation Account also gives you the opportunity to contemplate questions and details about what’s going on  to help you create a foundation of knowledge (however strong you’re feeling to work towards). Giving more power back to the patient. (Did you know that even your fashion choice can affect how your appointment goes?)</li>
<li>The Medical &amp; Motivation Account has been built recognizing that the user/patient has the potential of being the true expert on their health - the one who has to deal with any course of treatment decided on (the good, the bad and the ugly). Therefore, this person should have an opportunity to grow their voice in the decision-making process and on their own team. We want to help.</li>
<li>The Medical &amp; Motivation Account has been created by Jenna, who has grown up in the healthcare system and knows what it takes to be a competent and confident patient (after making a lot of mistakes out of denial, resentment, and a yearning to be more than a patient in the eyes of society). She is now committed to using her experiences as a patient to become a better practitioner.</li>
<li>It comes with 9 sections: Symptoms (with a NEW Pain Tracker after project completion), Medication, Before My Appointment, My Appointment, Doctors, Surgery/Procedure, In Case of Emergency, Need to Know, Motivation.</li>
<li>The new Pain Tracker has been created with the guidance of those who deal with pain on a regular basis - Jenna wanted to go to the experts for that! </li>
<li>We wanted to bring you a tool that accurately validates and communicates what it means to live with chronic pain, while working to maintain your quality of life. It is highly customizable, so that you can then see and show others who can offer the right support what pain looks like and feels to you, which gives you the best chance to find the right help. You'll be able to assign different pain types with a colour and use your finger or a stylus to show exactly where it hurts on the outline of a body provided. Ultimately, we want the app to take that data and turn it into a chart so you can see how pain affects your life, potentially seeing patterns and a new game strategy!</li>
<li>Our Medication section has become more comprehensive, giving you the opportunity to get notifications and reminders to take your meds and how much. It goes further to support those of you with more complex regimes that might come about during Cancer treatments, because the stress of keeping up with everything is that last thing you need!</li>
<li>We have also worked to make sure you can get reminders and notifications of upcoming appointments, so you can focus on getting ready - mind, body, and spirit - for those appointments and make the most out of them.</li>

While I’d been in the hospital many times before, this last visit easily crowned the stress chart. I’d had to be relentless in dealing with the medical staff, I felt mostly ignored as I voiced my concerns, and it was only a hysterical outburst on my part that finally got me the attention – and the emergency surgery right in my room – that I needed. It also left me with another little bonus - full-blown Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Ta da! I’d hit bottom.</p><p>Rock? Bottom has redeeming features, though! I realized clearly that it was my ability to advocate for myself (not easy when you don’t like bothering people) that had saved my life. I also realized how many lessons I’d learned over the years that could not only help me, if I crunched them into a system, but could help so many others (including parents of children with medical needs) who were just starting their medical odyssey or hadn’t been in the kiln quite as long.</p><p>These experiences as a patient trying and learning to navigate the healthcare system are enriched by my work as a registered social worker with a Master's of Social Work degree. I see how to effectively navigate the system and the support that can make the biggest impact. I have an understanding of what patients need from their practitioners, and what practitioners need from their patients. Therefore, you learn a variety of lessons: how to be assertive, not aggressive; how to better communicate your (the various items in a list need to have parallel structure) needs and ability; tips and tricks like how your outfit can impact your appointment and what you can do to keep calm and resilient as a patient; and how to continue growing and evolving into a competent and confident patient.

Very recently I was thrown a curve ball, and having no previous experience with serious health concerns, my new reality was very distressing and overwhelming. Phoenix Attitude proved vital in helping me navigate this unexpected and highly emotionally-charged situation by preparing me for appointments with my doctors, and providing the right tools for me to get all of my important information down during and after these appointments, to be able to draw upon it whenever I may need in the future. I only wish I had taken advantage of all this site has to offer sooner, rather than waiting for a crisis situation. I highly recommend Phoenix Attitude to anyone who wants to be proactive about their health. Thank you, Phoenix Attitude! </p><p><strong>Caregiver - </strong>Phoenix Attitude has changed my life for the better. As a professional caregiver it enables me to easily input my client’s important health information and share it with their family. I like being able to give my elderly clients’ children the opportunity to stay involved, even if they’ve moved away and are raising their own family. With the Medical &amp; Motivation account, distance does not have to impede families taking care of each other.</p><p><strong>Daughter - </strong>I am the daughter of a mother with an acquired brain injury. This sudden illness resulted in an extended hospital stay and a flurry of appointments with doctors whose specialties I had never even heard of. This was overwhelming and scary for me, as an 18 year old, and for my siblings. During that time, many questions were put to us that, as her children, we had never considered and couldn’t begin to answer. During those early years we were carried along in a flow of confusion, fear and barely understood medical terminology. We didn’t know what questions to ask or even how to understand the answers to the questions we were able to ask. </p><p>Now, almost 14 years on I am still going to appointments with my mother, but today I attend those appointments as my mother’s advocate.

I felt relief.

All too often when faced with a form I find myself wondering what to write, but the prompts and options provided offer the direction, while not limiting the user to a ‘form answer’.

We know that the information is compiled and accessible if we need it.As the daughter of a medically complex parent I highly recommend the Medical & Motivation Account created by Phoenix Attitude. It has given my mother control of her own medical journey and her children a sense of relief. Thank you Phoenix Attitude!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The end result was an ambulance ride to UTMB in Galveston where they disovered he had a compound fracture in his right leg along with a gash on his back.

<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Zac's Legacy Foundation is a small nonprofit that was founded by the family of Zac Carlson, who died of cancer at age 2 1/2 in 2000.  They help families that are fighting childhood cancer by providing financial assistance that allows the family to be there for their child as they undergo treatment.  Since 2000, they have raised and given away over $750,000.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I was asked to consult with Zac's to help them in two areas:  The first is to develop and implement services for survivors and their families as a growing number of kids beat cancer but are faced with many other problems as they reach their late teens and early adulthood.  No one is addressing these needs at present.  The second area of need is for an ongoing donor base.  The organization exists from fundraiser to fundraiser and doesn't have a group of donors that supports its ongoing work.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I am uniquely qualified to help them since I have over 30 years experience as Executive Director of nonprofit organizations, have survived cancer twice in the past six years, and my daughter died of cancer at age 9 in 1976.  Her mom and I are survivors of the era when you slept on couches in the hospital waiting room while you waited for news about your child.   Although she and I haven't spoken about this for many years, I am sure that she would support this campaign also.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Specifically, this campaign will allow me the time and resources to help Zac's move into the future.  All money they currently raise goes to helping families and they have nothing to use for building a much needed infrastructure.  They have no donor data base, recognition software, or fundraising plan.  In fact, I have to take my own laptop when I go to their office.  </span><br/></p>

<p>John</p></span></span></span></span></div>","Zac's Legacy Foundation is a small nonprofit that was founded by the family of Zac Carlson, who died of cancer at age 2 1/2 in 2000.  They help families that are fighting childhood cancer by providing financial assistance that allows the family to be there for their child as they undergo treatment.  Since 2000, they have raised and given away over $750,000.

I was asked to consult with Zac's to help them in two areas:  The first is to develop and implement services for survivors and their families as a growing number of kids beat cancer but are faced with many other problems as they reach their late teens and early adulthood.  No one is addressing these needs at present.  The second area of need is for an ongoing donor base.  The organization exists from fundraiser to fundraiser and doesn't have a group of donors that supports its ongoing work.
I am uniquely qualified to help them since I have over 30 years experience as Executive Director of nonprofit organizations, have survived cancer twice in the past six years, and my daughter died of cancer at age 9 in 1976.  Her mom and I are survivors of the era when you slept on couches in the hospital waiting room while you waited for news about your child.   Although she and I haven't spoken about this for many years, I am sure that she would support this campaign also.
Specifically, this campaign will allow me the time and resources to help Zac's move into the future.  All money they currently raise goes to helping families and they have nothing to use for building a much needed infrastructure.  They have no donor data base, recognition software, or fundraising plan.  In fact, I have to take my own laptop when I go to their office.  
My plan is to use the funds we raise to allow me to build the donor base through personal contact, mail, and media.  I need about $1,000 per month to allow me to quit my other part time job and devote the time to Zac's that it will take to get this going.  I will use the other money for subscriptions, software, other costs related to the infrastructure.  When we get the funding base going, I will shift gears and begin to work on new services.  The reason for putting the fundraising first is so that we don't start something we can't continue over time.
 Since Zac's is a 501(c)3 organization, all donations will be tax deductible.  If the goal is not reached, the money will still go to the organization and I will have to find somewhere else to find the additional funds needed to help meet these needs.  
I am having trouble coming up with perks -- In addition to the tax deduction, everyone who donates will receive Zac's newsletter (either email or snail mail).  However, my grown up kids tell me that they love the goodies I send them at Christmas, so if someone wants to make a large donation, I will send them some of the best caramel corn that they will ever taste.  I think I have to limit this to donors within the USA, because I don't know how legal it is to send candy across borders.

<h3>The Robertson's Story:</h3>
<p>In December of 2012 Jaxson was diagnosed with stage 4 Hepatoblastoma, a rare form of liver cancer that usually hits children under 3 years of age.  Over the last 6 months Jaxson has undergone several treatments of chemotherapy at the Arkansas Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>Even though he has responded well to the chemotherapy the family recently found out a resection, a removal of part of his liver, will not be possible as they had hoped.  They have been told Jaxson will need a complete liver transplant as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Thankfully, due to the advanced stage of the cancer, Jaxson has been moved to the top of the list to receive a liver transplant at the St. Louis Children's Hospital as soon as one becomes available.</p>
<p>I am launching this campaign in the hopes that some of you will be willing to help this wonderful little boy and his family out.  While insurance is helping pick up the largest portion of their medical bills, it isn't covering everything.  On top of that, the family is struggling with the various travel expenses of making the 700 mile round trip.  (food, lodging, gasoline, etc)</p>
<p>Over the next few months they will have to make this 700 mile round trip several times, along with a two week stay in the St. Louis area when Jaxson receives his new liver.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! Thanks for clicking on my campaign :)</p>
<p>Simply put, my name is Julia, and I am starting a breakfast cereal business.</p>
<p>It is a Wheat-free, Low-Glycemic, High-andioxidant, Superfood breakfast.</p>
<p>Very easy to make. Make it only once, save leftovers in the fridge for a convenient breakfast for mornings to come!</p>
<p>My background includes:</p>
<p>-Growing up in Whistler, therefore gaining a deep resepect for the environment and what it has to offer in the way of sports, organic food, and healthy living.</p>
<p>-The Whistler lifestyle inspired me to excell in skiing and fall in love with biking, and anything else to do with being outdoors. </p>
<p>-Competing in the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in my hometown in Ski Cross (coming 12th, despite a badly injured knee). I created this as a dream as a positive thinking kid in 5th grade, and achieved my goal when the time came. This created a sense of great accomplishment,making me realize that it really is true that goals do become dreams come true. Now, I am fired up, confident, and extremely passionate about my next life goal: my very healthy cereal business that will fuel people to their personal excellence and positive, active lives.</p>
<p>Now, you can have a small part in making this cereal business a successful and inspiring story.</p>
<p>My cereal represents a healthy lifestyle, a deep respect for the environment, and the willingness to get up and do something great every day. </p>
<p>After doing farmers markets, I know that this product is something people love. It makes them feel good about what they are putting into their body and it tastes delicious. It allows them to do anything they need to do that day with sustainable energy.</p>
<p>I'll be promoting the cereal myself in the multiple grocery stores across Whistler, then Whole Foods. Along with the promotion of the cereal, I will be promoting my Olympic story and the importance of healthy eating and active lifestyle to achieve a healthy and positive life. I will be getting the exciting point across that if you fuel your body the best way available, you will get the most out of who you are physically, emotionally and mentally... throughout the day.</p>
<p>Having my father (Crazy Canuck, Dave Murray) pass away from Melanoma, I will be partnering with the Melanoma Network of Canada to bring awareness to the importance of sun protection. My cereal is a great way to help extend the awareness across the continent eventually. </p>
<p>Within the next year the goal is to have all the grocery stores in Whistler stocked with Jules Fuel, as well as the Whole Foods in Vancouver. I will be sharing my passion for the product, and for healthy living at these stores, in the community, and in the media consistently throughout the entire process, and onward!</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello everyone and thank you for coming to my campaign. I am William Shkrob. When I was not yet 6 years old, my dad gave me a tennis racket, drew a tennis court on our driveway, and used the kiddy badminton net as tennis net. I remember kids from all over the neighborhood coming to play tennis on our “do it yourself” court and all the parents watching and having as much fun as we did. That’s how I started playing the game that I passionately love. Since that important day I have grown a lot. I am now a high school freshman and am 5 feet 11 inches tall. We moved to Florida from Michigan almost 3 years ago, so that I could play tennis 24/7/365, which I actually do. I am now getting ready to participate in my first international tournament and that is where I need your help, folks. This tournament is important, first, because I will be representing our country. And also, this is where I begin earning international points in order to participate in higher level tournaments leading to college or professional tennis.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi people!  Here's the story.  In October 2012, I injured my back lifting weights.  I was forced out of work in January with a bulged L5S1 disc in my spine.  I had terrible spasms that shot down my right leg as far down as my calf.  These spasms could last seconds up to 5-10 minutes.  My girlfriend had to help me roll over in bed, get off the couch, and most days, even get dressed in the mornings.  On 2/21/13, I had a procedure done that removed some bone, ligaments, and broken disc from my spine.  I felt great after it...for about a week.  I ended up having more of the remaining disc slip ou, and the spasms were even worse than before.  I had spinal fusion surgery on 4/2/13.  The procedure was scheduled to be a 2 hour procedure.  Due to the amount of scar tissue that was wrapped around my nerve, and the amount of damage, the surgery took about 4 1/2 hours.  When I woke up from that one, the pain was intense!  About a week after that surgery, the top of the incision became infected and I was in the ER for about 13 hours.  When the stitches came out, the top of the incision had not healed at all and was an open hole (just below the ""Y"" in my tattoo).  The hole was about an inch long, inch wide, and an inch and a half deep.  It had to be packed twice a day with saline soaked gauze for the next 2 1/2 months.  Needless to say, this set back my recovery 2 1/2 months.  I was finally cleared to begin light exercise in the end of June.  I had gone form being in the gym 3 hours a day, 6 days a week, to barely being able to handle 30 minutes of non impact cardio.  Work denied my return to work restrictions that my Doctors had put in place, and Long Term Disability is denying my claim for coverage.  I am out of work, and out of ways to cover the most basic of life expences.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I had medical insurance, which did cover a good majority of the expenses of the procedures.  The at home supplies for the packing of the open wound, co-pays, and out of pocket costs have run my $7500 out of pocket just for the medical costs impact.  Now with not being able to return to my regular job, I have no income due to the denial of the long term disability claim.  I am hoping to be back to work by the beginning of fall at the latest, unless I find a job that does not interfear with the restrictions my Doctors put in place.  I have never been one to ask for help in any situation, but this time, I have to step out of my comfort zone.  I don't expect to live like I did when I was working full time with no injury, I am just trying to cover the medical bills, insurance costs, eat, and keep my vehicle on the road so I can get to my Doctors appointments and the gym.  If I end up raising any funds that don't get used for these purposes, I will pay it forward to another charitable cause.  I spent the vast majority of my free time and funds in my adult life giving my body to entertain others and help them forget about their daily worries.  Now I am asking those of you that I may have entertained to help me out a little bit if you can.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you can help, I greatly appreicate it.  Please share this on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, any social netowrk you can.  Any help is a great help right now.  Thank you so very much.  I will bounce back from this and be back to normal as soon as I can so I can get back to doing what I love.  ANd until then, I will Keep Calm and Chive On!</p>

I had medical insurance, which did cover a good majority of the expenses of the procedures.  The at home supplies for the packing of the open wound, co-pays, and out of pocket costs have run my $7500 out of pocket just for the medical costs impact.  Now with not being able to return to my regular job, I have no income due to the denial of the long term disability claim.  I am hoping to be back to work by the beginning of fall at the latest, unless I find a job that does not interfear with the restrictions my Doctors put in place.  I have never been one to ask for help in any situation, but this time, I have to step out of my comfort zone.  I don't expect to live like I did when I was working full time with no injury, I am just trying to cover the medical bills, insurance costs, eat, and keep my vehicle on the road so I can get to my Doctors appointments and the gym.  If I end up raising any funds that don't get used for these purposes, I will pay it forward to another charitable cause.  I spent the vast majority of my free time and funds in my adult life giving my body to entertain others and help them forget about their daily worries.  Now I am asking those of you that I may have entertained to help me out a little bit if you can.


If you can help, I greatly appreicate it.  Please share this on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, any social netowrk you can.  Any help is a great help right now.  Thank you so very much.  I will bounce back from this and be back to normal as soon as I can so I can get back to doing what I love.  ANd until then, I will Keep Calm and Chive On!

<p><strong>Who we are...</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are a group of friends who care about our health and the environment around us.  A few years ago we began to realise just how many harmful chemicals were in the toiletries and cleaning products we were using on ourselves and homes on a daily basis.</p>
<p>                            <img alt=""What's in your bathroom product?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/772893/pictures/full/20130423143429-bak_of_label.jpg?1366752872"" src="""" style="""" title=""What's in your bathroom product?""/></p>
<p>Just take a look at the label on one of your personal care or cleaning products and see how many ingredients you can't even pronounce! We discovered there were some serious health problems we were putting ourselves at risk of by using these commercial brands, without even realising it. So we made the decision to avoid these ingredients and switch to using natural, chemical-free products which wouldn't mess with our health.</p>
<p>                            <img alt=""What's in your shampoo?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/772917/pictures/full/20130423144701-shampoo_chemical.jpg?1366753629"" src="""" style="""" title=""What's in your shampoo?""/> </p>
<p>We soon discovered that even 'natural', 'organic' or 'chemical free' products were often not in fact free of extremely harmful and toxic ingredients or even 100% organic! (have a quick google about Sodium Laurel Sulphate which is in 90% of products that foam and you will see what we mean).</p>
<p>                             <img alt=""baby bath"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/776378/pictures/full/20130425102802-Unhappy_baby.jpg?1366910888"" src="""" style="""" title=""Toxic baby""/></p>
<p>On our travels in Asia we discovered someone making exactly what we were looking for: 100% natural, chemical-free products containing only natural, plant ingredients with no pesticides or other chemicals involved anywhere in the process. Immediately we knew that we had to make these available to people in the UK-and worldwide!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/772922/pictures/full/20130423144837-banner_coconuts_copy.png?1366753725"" src="""" style="""" title=""Banner 2""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why should you get involved?</strong></p>
<p>We're looking to raise £5000 (although if we get more that would be brilliant), this will cover the initial order to bring the product into the UK and set up all the business operations. We have planned a large range of other products we'll be launching too which we are very excited to tell you about! So the more we raise the faster we'll be able to bring these to the market and build up the business. </p>
<p>The perks we've put together ensure you'll be the first in the world to get scrubbing with the Natures Knowledge range of personal care products. We're building a community of like minded people who are passionate health and changing their environments.</p>
<p>                      <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/776485/pictures/full/20130425111050-3_tubes_small.jpg?1366913453"" src="""" style="""" title=""our stuff""/></p>
<p>If we don't meet our goals we'll still be bringing in these amazing products, we'll just have to beg and borrow... that is how much we believe in them!!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><br/>As you would expect, these personal care products are 100% natural, paraben-free, chemical-free, pesticide-free, naturally hypoallergenic, vegan and completely free from any animal testing. They smell great and are fantasic to use because they are made entirely from plants. Even the ingredient that makes the bubbles is a simple fruit - the soap nut!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/776418/pictures/full/20130425104007-bubble_soap_nut.jpg?1366911609"" src="""" style="""" title=""Eco Bubble""/></p>
<p>Not only that, these products are also probiotic and bio-positive which means using them actually improves the environment! This is all down to the Effective Microorganisms ('EM's') which are probiotic good bacteria that basically clean up the harmful bacteria (a bit like that well known yoghurt with added good bacteria). </p>
<p>                   <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/776382/pictures/full/20130425102912-em_s.jpg?1366910955"" src="""" style="""" title=""Em's""/></p>
<p>Another good thing is that the place where our products are made use absolutely no machinery during the bottling process which means we leave practically no carbon footprint! </p>
<p>                   <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/777913/pictures/full/20130426075805-Carbon-footprint-002.jpg?1366988288"" src="""" style="""" title=""Green Footprint ""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you care about your health and your environment and want to avoid health problems from using harmful chemicals and help prevent their toxic build-up in the environment alongside like-minded people who want to protect and promote healthy people and a healthy ecosystem, Nature's Knowledge products are something we know you will love!</p>

(have a quick google about Sodium Laurel Sulphate which is in 90% of products that foam and you will see what we mean).
                             
On our travels in Asia we discovered someone making exactly what we were looking for: 100% natural, chemical-free products containing only natural, plant ingredients with no pesticides or other chemicals involved anywhere in the process. Immediately we knew that we had to make these available to people in the UK-and worldwide!



 
Why should you get involved?
We're looking to raise £5000 (although if we get more that would be brilliant), this will cover the initial order to bring the product into the UK and set up all the business operations. We have planned a large range of other products we'll be launching too which we are very excited to tell you about! So the more we raise the faster we'll be able to bring these to the market and build up the business. 
The perks we've put together ensure you'll be the first in the world to get scrubbing with the Natures Knowledge range of personal care products. We're building a community of like minded people who are passionate health and changing their environments.
                      
If we don't meet our goals we'll still be bringing in these amazing products, we'll just have to beg and borrow... that is how much we believe in them!!
 


The Impact
As you would expect, these personal care products are 100% natural, paraben-free, chemical-free, pesticide-free, naturally hypoallergenic, vegan and completely free from any animal testing. They smell great and are fantasic to use because they are made entirely from plants. Even the ingredient that makes the bubbles is a simple fruit - the soap nut!
 
                                
Not only that, these products are also probiotic and bio-positive which means using them actually improves the environment! This is all down to the Effective Microorganisms ('EM's') which are probiotic good bacteria that basically clean up the harmful bacteria (a bit like that well known yoghurt with added good bacteria). 
                   
Another good thing is that the place where our products are made use absolutely no machinery during the bottling process which means we leave practically no carbon footprint! 
                   
 
If you care about your health and your environment and want to avoid health problems from using harmful chemicals and help prevent their toxic build-up in the environment alongside like-minded people who want to protect and promote healthy people and a healthy ecosystem, Nature's Knowledge products are something we know you will love!

<p>On May 10th we are hosting a Healthy Pregnancy Fair for women in the local community. The fair will provide participants with information about how to have a healthy pregnancy, offer services including pregnancy testing, prenatal vitamins, and blood pressure testing, and highlight the array of services available to pregnant women at Silver Ave Health Center.</p>
<p>Your campaign contribution will bring women the opportunity to have a healthy pregnancy. And healthy pregnancies mean healthy babies!</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>The Greater Impact</strong></p>
<div>Access to Prenatal care is a major issue in the United States and has been linked to the pervasive health disparities that exist between different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. According to the National Vital Statistics Reports of 2005, 29.8% of pregnant women in the United States that year did not begin care in their 1<sup>st</sup> trimester.</div>
<p>Julia Phillipi’s 2009 literature review of studies exploring access to prenatal care in the United States since 1990 reveals a variety of barriers preventing low-income women who are pregnant or plan to be pregnant from entering care. Some of the structural barriers identified include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation to and from the clinic</li>
<li>Wait time while at the clinic</li>
<li>Cost of services</li>
<li>Language capacity of medical providers</li>
<li>Cultural sensitivity of the staff</li>
</ul>
<p>Silver Avenue is located right in the heart of Portola providing convenient access to doctors and nurses as well as prenatal social workers, prenatal nutritionists and an eligibility worker who helps patients to identify and apply for payment reduction opportunities.</p>
<p>Our multilingual staff is trained in Customer Service and provides friendly, thorough, culturally sensitive care to every patient who walks through the door. As a family health center, we offer continuity of care that our patients value. Once the baby arrives, both mother and newborn can continue to be seen by the same doctor and medical assistant at Silver Ave.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of prenatal care at Silver Ave is our Centering Program, a model of supportive group care for women before and after childbirth. Group care increases access for prenatal patients, cuts down on wait time, and provides a forum for parents to network with other parents in the community. Across the nation, Centering has been shown to increase the health and satisfaction of soon-to-be mothers.</p>
<p>In my year of service at Silver Ave, I have been lucky enough to sit-in on some of the Centering Groups. It was so much fun watching the new mothers compare notes about the challenges and joys of childbirth in their first meeting after delivery!</p>
<p>We believe it is never too early to plan a pregnancy. This event will provide people in our community the opportunity to ask questions about how to have a healthy pregnancy and learn the difference between fact and myth. </p>
<p>With your help we can bring educational information and the valuable services provided at Silver Ave Family Health Center to the attention of more women throughout the community.  </p>

</h1>
I am a Wellness and Human Resources Consultant in Anchorage, Alaska.  My husband calls me a wellness nut.  I’m also a mom, travel enthusiast, cyclist, aspiring triathlete, entrepreneur and self-described economics geek.  I’ve been customizing and shopping wellness programs for businesses for the past 10 years and while there are some good programs out there, I have yet to find one that is comprehensive, affordable, effective, engaging, AND accessible to businesses or groups of any size (as well as accessible to any person, regardless of ability).

<em>So I thought: if I can’t find it, I’ll just build it.</em>
We need a comprehensive, affordable, effective, engaging, and accessible workplace wellness solution in Alaska (and everywhere else too!).<br/><br/><h1>
<span style=""color: #2d1a48;"">YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL HELP</span> <span style=""color: #1f9f9a;"">MAKE THIS CONCEPT A REALITY.</span>
</h1>
As a life-long Alaskan, I am basing WhiteWater Wellness here in Alaska, the most beautiful place on earth. I initially want to build and perfect this program here, because very few wellness vendors even want to bother with our market and because Alaskan businesses and their employees have some unique challenges and opportunities when it comes to health and well-being. If we can make this successful here in AK, then we can expand anywhere.<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17729/files/20130817123458-www_crowdfund_10.jpg?1376768098"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h1><span style=""color: #1f9f9a;"">What is wellness or well-being?</span></h1>
Let’s face it, “wellness” has become a buzz word and it has been defined many ways. I’m ignoring the buzz, and using the definition backed by hardcore research done by the Gallup Organization (outlined in the book <em>“Well-Being: The Five Essential Elements”</em> by Tom Rath and James Harter). They went all over the world to find the common elements of well-being regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, age, country of origin, religions, etc. <span style=""color: #1f9f9a;"">This is what they found:</span>


Having <em>high well-being</em> is the difference between a life spent thriving and one spent suffering. It is having a balance between the following elements:

<h1><span style=""color: #1f9f9a;"">Why wellness at work?</span></h1>
2080 is a LOT of hours in a year: It’s where most people spend the majority of their time – if you are disengaged at work, the other areas of your life suffer too.

WHITEWATERWELLNESS

I am a Wellness and Human Resources Consultant in Anchorage, Alaska.  My husband calls me a wellness nut.  I’m also a mom, travel enthusiast, cyclist, aspiring triathlete, entrepreneur and self-described economics geek.  I’ve been customizing and shopping wellness programs for businesses for the past 10 years and while there are some good programs out there, I have yet to find one that is comprehensive, affordable, effective, engaging, AND accessible to businesses or groups of any size (as well as accessible to any person, regardless of ability).

So I thought: if I can’t find it, I’ll just build it.
We need a comprehensive, affordable, effective, engaging, and accessible workplace wellness solution in Alaska (and everywhere else too!).
YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL HELP MAKE THIS CONCEPT A REALITY.

As a life-long Alaskan, I am basing WhiteWater Wellness here in Alaska, the most beautiful place on earth. I initially want to build and perfect this program here, because very few wellness vendors even want to bother with our market and because Alaskan businesses and their employees have some unique challenges and opportunities when it comes to health and well-being. If we can make this successful here in AK, then we can expand anywhere.
What is wellness or well-being?
Let’s face it, “wellness” has become a buzz word and it has been defined many ways. I’m ignoring the buzz, and using the definition backed by hardcore research done by the Gallup Organization (outlined in the book “Well-Being: The Five Essential Elements” by Tom Rath and James Harter). They went all over the world to find the common elements of well-being regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, age, country of origin, religions, etc. This is what they found:


Having high well-being is the difference between a life spent thriving and one spent suffering. It is having a balance between the following elements:

Why wellness at work?
2080 is a LOT of hours in a year: It’s where most people spend the majority of their time – if you are disengaged at work, the other areas of your life suffer too.

What will the program do? How will I be able to use it?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Simply said, we are a group of women trying to help our friend who is desperately trying to help her beloved sister.  </p>
<p>Cindy Danner, friend to many and sister of Barbara Warner, has had a rough time this past year.  Most significantly, she just spent 7 long weeks in the hospital, after many, many weeks of previous hospitalizations.  Cindy has brittle juvenile diabetes, complicated by a rare disorder, gastroparesis, that had been in remission for five years, but has come back with a vengeance.  She is suffering from malnutrition, associated pain, is weak, frail, and alarmingly thin (she weighs just 93 pounds).</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury... Cindy, a smart, educated, married 56 years old, (she holds a BA and an MSW degree), is unable to work, has gone through her savings, and is experiencing mounting medical debt.  She and her husband (who is also disabled) are facing the unthinkable…losing their home.   </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></p>
</div>
<p>We are supposed to tell you how much funding we need.  When you are down to nothing, seriously ill, and prospects looking bleak, ANYTHING will help.  Medications are dreadfully expensive, nourishment costly, and outside assistance simply out of the question.  </p>
<p><em><strong>Our goal is simple.  </strong></em>We want to raise at least $5000 for Cindy, which will give her a significant leg-up.  </p>
<p>Here is where we are supposed to tell you ""what you get"" if you give.  Besides knowing that you are helping a woman through the toughest time of her life, you'll get a heartfelt thank you letter from Cindy herself, along with a picture.  </p>
<p>Oh, and if we don't actually reach our goal, we'll still give everything raised ~ all of it ~ to Cindy.  For which she will be ecstatic, releived, and grateful.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you can, imagine how it feels to never have had to ask for help. To always have paid your bills, your taxes, your dues.  To always have held a good, respected job fulfilling your ambitions.  And to have always enjoyed good health.  </p>
<p>Then imagine it all gone.  All of it.  </p>
<p>The impact of your donation won't move the earth.  But it will move your heart.  It will help a stranger who doesn't deserve the bad hand she's been dealt.  It will give her the mental boost to continue to push forward.  One foot in front of the other.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If this is just something you cannot contribute to at this time, please remember Cindy in your prayers.  And send us good vibrations as we move forward in our quest to help her.  </p>

Our goal is simple.  We want to raise at least $5000 for Cindy, which will give her a significant leg-up.  
Here is where we are supposed to tell you ""what you get"" if you give.  Besides knowing that you are helping a woman through the toughest time of her life, you'll get a heartfelt thank you letter from Cindy herself, along with a picture.  
Oh, and if we don't actually reach our goal, we'll still give everything raised ~ all of it ~ to Cindy.  For which she will be ecstatic, releived, and grateful.

The Impact
If you can, imagine how it feels to never have had to ask for help. To always have paid your bills, your taxes, your dues.  To always have held a good, respected job fulfilling your ambitions.  And to have always enjoyed good health.  
Then imagine it all gone.  All of it.  
The impact of your donation won't move the earth.  But it will move your heart.  It will help a stranger who doesn't deserve the bad hand she's been dealt.  It will give her the mental boost to continue to push forward.  One foot in front of the other.  


Other Ways You Can Help
If this is just something you cannot contribute to at this time, please remember Cindy in your prayers.  And send us good vibrations as we move forward in our quest to help her.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi- my name is Stu Douglass.  I am an inventor and the founder of Roller Clutch Tools. I put my self through college by rebuilding motors for friends and class mates.  My favorite tool was the ratchet wrench because it was easy to use and faster than a box wrench.  One day I mashed my knuckles into the engine block when the ratchet gear suddenly stripped.  I decided then and there that the ratchet design was in need of a serious overhaul.</p>
<p>My team at Roller Clutch has worked long and hard to design and patent a reversible roller clutch. This makes the perfect replacement for the old ratchet. Our tools use rollers rather than gears as rollers are stronger and safer. They are also more efficient and function with a zero back throw.  This is really important when working in tight spaces.</p>
<p>The NRG3 is the only roller clutch ratchet that can withstand off-axis loading.  Several inventors have tried to build a reversible roller clutch but all have failed until now.  Our local Snap-on dealer has said ""this is the nicest gearless ratchet he has ever seen"".</p>
<p>Our team is reaching out to the Indiegogo crowd to help launch the NRG3.  We have spent a considerable amount of money on the engineering, prototyping and testing of this unique tool.  Now we need your help to build and distribute this worldwide.  Your contributions will make launching this product possible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A tool of this kind requires a different vendor or supplier for each of the components. Some of the parts such as the rollers and snap rings are readily available off the shelf. Others such as the cage and spindle are unique to the design and require special machining.  When that is the case, each part needs a mold or die made to allow mass production.  </p>
<p>The $35K funding will be used to pay for the tooling and assembly of the NRG3.  In the event we raise less than this amount we are prepared to sell equity in our company to ensure that we have adequate funds to complete our first orders.  </p>
<p>The perks we are offering include the 1/4"" and the 3/8"" socket wrenches.  The handles for the 3/8"" model are 3D printed per our video. You will be the first worldwide to feel the benefits of this unique tool.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our team has been involved with the design and distribution of several commercial products. We understand the process and the amount of hard work required to launch the NRG3. We have collaborated together for over 5 years in order to design and test the perfect roller clutch ratchet.  </p>
<p>The members on our team include:</p>
<p>Stu Douglass- inventor and company founder</p>
<p>Steve Adelman- inventor and engineer</p>
<p>Dan Adams- inventor and engineer</p>
<p>Andrew Butler- inventor and engineer</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Brook Drumm- 3D printing specialist </span></p>
<p>Scott McGowan- marketing specialist for AM</p>
<p>John Maxey- attorney and CPA</p>
<p>The NRG3 will enable our contributors to assemble all types of projects such as engines, RC planes, 3D printer kits, robots, bicycles etc; in a manner which is safer and more efficient.  This is the first major improvement for socket wrenches and will have a beneficial impact on all of us that use tools worldwide.</p>
<p>As Steve Jobs once said ""Humans are basically tool builders"".  Our team believes the time has come to take tools to the next level.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span></h3> </div> <div> <h3>(Benton Mackenzies own words below)</h3>
</div><div>My name is Benton Mackenzie. I have angiosarcoma cancer. People with this cancer that don't get treatment can apparently expect to die within two years. The average for those that do get treatment is three years, according to the head of oncology at University of Iowa Hospital. I have a synthetic aortic valve and cardiovascular disease that complicate any traditional treatments for a blood vessel cancer to the point that they would be fatal, much sooner than two years. I've been living with angiosarcoma for over six years. I have already found that a cannabis oil with a 1:1 ratio of THC to CBD has shown it can shrink and remove my tumors. The first one that appeared got the size of a golf ball and cut off my sciatic nerve to the point I could not push on the gas or brake pedal to drive and after a week of cannabis oil application I could drive again. Within two months it was just a pink spot! Many other strains of cannabis oil can slow and stop the growth and spread of my angiosarcoma tumors as well, thus, extending my life and vastly improving the quality of what life I have left. <br/>I've seen dramatic improvements in my overall health, my heart and lungs through juicing fresh cannabis plants. This brings many benficial and medicinal properties that are not achievable through drying and smoking including, if not heated, live enzymes and no psychoactive properties. Even in concentrated forms of oil if not heated possess no psychoactive effects which can be beneficial for a range of ages and conditions. This requires from thirty to fifty plants that will only flower for a fraction of the time for traditional harvesting of buds for oil and inhaling. <br/>I'm currently fighting Scott County, Iowa with the Neccessity Defense clause, since myself, my wife, my son and my best friend were arrested in June of this year because I grew my medicine. Even my parents were charged and all of us are awaiting trial. These sheriff's deputies knew I had cancer because we went through this three years ago with them. They keep on taking my family to jail because they won't abandon me in my time of need.<br/>I have a right given to me by my Creator and recognized by the Constitution of these United States to the right to my life, my liberty and my pursuit of happiness/ownership of property. As things stand now, I need to get moved to California, as it's the only state currently offering a realistic alternative to death for me, and a doctor there confirms and will prescribe what I have found to be effective already. I am on Social Security Disability for about a thousand dollars a month, so paying for medicine is going to be a very difficult as well. Some of the legal expenses include finding a good attorney to help me seek damages.<br/>
</div><div>I would appreciate that if you give, do so only if divinely inspired and don't even let the left hand know that the right hand is giving. If you're in a situation that the left hand may come looking for it, then it's not appropriate for the right hand to give. For God provides to those who give, enough to give and enough left over for themselves. If the giver is left with nothing themselves, then it wasn't given by God to give. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to listen to my story. <br/>

My name is Shane Koopmans and I am creating this fundraiser to help out a very ill Iowan.  His name is Benton Mackenzie and he has Angisarcoma Cancer.  It is rare and aggressive.  Iowa government will not allow him to treat himself.  If they are unwilling to help then I think the citizens of Iowa and the U.S.A. should stand up and help someone in need and that is what I am doing.  Below is a copy and pasted description of himself and his story from another site.  I want to use it because only he truly knows whats going on and what he has to go through. 
    (Benton Mackenzies own words below)
My name is Benton Mackenzie. I have angiosarcoma cancer. People with this cancer that don't get treatment can apparently expect to die within two years. The average for those that do get treatment is three years, according to the head of oncology at University of Iowa Hospital. I have a synthetic aortic valve and cardiovascular disease that complicate any traditional treatments for a blood vessel cancer to the point that they would be fatal, much sooner than two years. I've been living with angiosarcoma for over six years. I have already found that a cannabis oil with a 1:1 ratio of THC to CBD has shown it can shrink and remove my tumors. The first one that appeared got the size of a golf ball and cut off my sciatic nerve to the point I could not push on the gas or brake pedal to drive and after a week of cannabis oil application I could drive again. Within two months it was just a pink spot! Many other strains of cannabis oil can slow and stop the growth and spread of my angiosarcoma tumors as well, thus, extending my life and vastly improving the quality of what life I have left. I've seen dramatic improvements in my overall health, my heart and lungs through juicing fresh cannabis plants. This brings many benficial and medicinal properties that are not achievable through drying and smoking including, if not heated, live enzymes and no psychoactive properties. Even in concentrated forms of oil if not heated possess no psychoactive effects which can be beneficial for a range of ages and conditions. This requires from thirty to fifty plants that will only flower for a fraction of the time for traditional harvesting of buds for oil and inhaling. I'm currently fighting Scott County, Iowa with the Neccessity Defense clause, since myself, my wife, my son and my best friend were arrested in June of this year because I grew my medicine. Even my parents were charged and all of us are awaiting trial. These sheriff's deputies knew I had cancer because we went through this three years ago with them. They keep on taking my family to jail because they won't abandon me in my time of need.I have a right given to me by my Creator and recognized by the Constitution of these United States to the right to my life, my liberty and my pursuit of happiness/ownership of property. As things stand now, I need to get moved to California, as it's the only state currently offering a realistic alternative to death for me, and a doctor there confirms and will prescribe what I have found to be effective already. I am on Social Security Disability for about a thousand dollars a month, so paying for medicine is going to be a very difficult as well. Some of the legal expenses include finding a good attorney to help me seek damages.
I would appreciate that if you give, do so only if divinely inspired and don't even let the left hand know that the right hand is giving. If you're in a situation that the left hand may come looking for it, then it's not appropriate for the right hand to give. For God provides to those who give, enough to give and enough left over for themselves. If the giver is left with nothing themselves, then it wasn't given by God to give. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my story.

family. Charity is Finton’s aunt and legal guardian. She is an elementary
librarian at Shenandoah Elementary and has been raising Finton since December 2012.
Finton is a 4 year old boy who was born with a chromosomal deletion known as
Cri du Chat. It is French for “cry of the cat”. When children with this rare
syndrome are born, their cry actually sounds like a cat crying. Finton faced
many serious health obstacles in his first three years of life. Some, but not
all were related to his syndrome. He had two heart surgeries and a cleft lip
repaired. He has also been labeled as failure to thrive and was in stage 3
malnutrition when he went to live with his aunt. Finton is no longer in any
stages of malnutrition and has thrived during the last year and a half. He
continues to be g-tube fed, but is very slowly accepting some soft foods. He
has severe cognitive and developmental delays, but has made much progress with
regular therapies and attending a preschool for those with delays. Fin can walk
with assistance and is in the process of receiving a speech communication
device, as he is also nonverbal. He loves the water, music, to be read to, and
is a huge fan of Kipper the Dog and Thomas the Train. The Loveless family would
love to attend camp this year. They would greatly appreciate any donations and
would like to thank everyone in advance!</p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>The cost for a family to attend Victory Lane Camp is $2000.
