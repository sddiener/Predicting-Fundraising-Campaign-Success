We are a group of nine undergraduate students, all part of a leadership organization called Sigma Chi Fraternity, Lambda Theta chapter of the University of Ottawa (uOttawa).
 

The goal of our Toys 4 Joy fundraising campaign is to make a difference in the lives of others by enhancing the holiday experience for children and youths living with cancer. Throughout our lives thus far, we have been taught that we can choose our life path, that we should strive to be all that we can be. This is our way of beginning that journey. We are fundraising to purchase Christmas gifts for the children and youth on the cancer ward of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO). With the money we raise, we hope to brighten up their Christmas stay in the hospital. We are very proud to have the blessing of the CHEO Foundation and of Santa! These gifts will be for them all to use based on a “wish list” that the Hospital has provided us as a guide. We will wrap and deliver in time for Santa’s sleigh on December 24th. 

 
The Sigma Chi Fraternity at uOttawa has been active in organizing numerous philanthropic events throughout the Ottawa community. Some of these include:
 


Homeless for the Homeless: brothers of the fraternity stayed and slept outside on the University campus in the winter for several nights to raise money for the homeless. We raised over $5000.


2011 Derby Days: fundraiser for the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO): Sigma Chi Fraternity raised over $7000.



Help us make a real difference this Christmas. We need your help!  Join our team and help spread the Christmas spirit!

Notre histoire
Nous sommes un groupe de neuf étudiants (premier cycle), tous faisant partie d’une fraternité nommée Sigma Chi Fraternity Lambda Theta, chapitre de l’université d’Ottawa (uOttawa)
Le but de notre campagne de financement ‘Toys 4 Joy’, est de faire une différence dans la vie des autres, en améliorant l’expérience de Noel pour les jeunes atteints de cancer. Nous avons appris, tout au long de notre vie, qu’on doit choisir un chemin; que nous devons être le meilleur de nous-mêmes. Cet effort marque le début d’une mission.

La fraternité Sigma Chi d’Ottawa est active dans l’organisation d’événements philanthropiques dans la communauté d’Ottawa, dont :
‘Homeless for the Homeless’: Les membres de la fraternité ont vécus dehors, sur le campus de l’université pendant l’hiver, afin de faire une levée de fonds pour les sans-abris. Nous avons amassé plus de 5,000 $.
‘2011 Derby Days’: levee de fonds pour le CHEO: la fraternité Sigma Chi a collectionné plus de 7,000$.

Aidez- nous à faire une différence pour Noel. Nous avons besoin de votre aide afin de partager l’esprit des fêtes.

<p>In collaboration with other non-profit organizations including Brandworkers, Centro de Inmigrante-Staten Island, La Union is currently organizing to assist those families who were left most vulnerable by Hurricane Sandy: immigrants. Thousands of immigrants in the coastal areas including Coney Island, the Far Rockaways and Staten Island were completely devastated by the impact of Sandy.  Unfortunately, thousands of immigrants will be left without institutional aid due to discrimination, language, complexities associated with filing claims, distrust of government institutions, legal status, etc.  Without any aid, it will be extremely difficult to recover.</p>
<p>This reoccurring project allows contributors to put funds and resources directly into the hands of immigrant families to be used for needs ranging from blankets and heaters to unemployment assistance.  Many are without housing and are living in extremely crowded conditions with little economic resources or have remained in hazardous environmental conditions with no funds to rid their homes or mildew and mold, or find other housing.</p>

In collaboration with other non-profit organizations including Brandworkers, Centro de Inmigrante-Staten Island, La Union is currently organizing to assist those families who were left most vulnerable by Hurricane Sandy: immigrants. Thousands of immigrants in the coastal areas including Coney Island, the Far Rockaways and Staten Island were completely devastated by the impact of Sandy.  Unfortunately, thousands of immigrants will be left without institutional aid due to discrimination, language, complexities associated with filing claims, distrust of government institutions, legal status, etc.  Without any aid, it will be extremely difficult to recover.
This reoccurring project allows contributors to put funds and resources directly into the hands of immigrant families to be used for needs ranging from blankets and heaters to unemployment assistance.  Many are without housing and are living in extremely crowded conditions with little economic resources or have remained in hazardous environmental conditions with no funds to rid their homes or mildew and mold, or find other housing.

<p> In February of 2010, I  suffered a sever spinal injury while on the job as a CNA. Little did we know, that at the time, I was about 2 weeks pregnant with our daughter.

In July of that year, I finally collapsed at work, losing control of my legs and bladder. By the time I was able to have and MRI performed, I had lost COMPLETE control of my bladder and was wearing diapers. Shortly after the MRI, which showed 1 herniated and two bulging discs, my surgeon performed an emergency microdiscectomy to prevent permanent nerve damage or paralysis.

<p>After the birth of our beautiful daughter, my symptoms returned, loss of bladder and leg control. Another MRI showed that the disc had herniated again and the other two were bulging.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>NEED</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In remote
villages, there is a lack of education and awareness surrounding the care
needed during and after pregnancy.  This
is compounded by the prohibitive distance to most government medical
facilities, cultural norms that make it hard for women to talk openly about
their body and pregnancy, and by institutionalized discrimination against
tribal women. As a result, home deliveries by untrained local women are common,
leading to enormously increased risk to both mother and child.  After birth, there is little postnatal care,
even though most maternal deaths happen in the postnatal period, and an equally
huge lack of knowledge surrounding proper breastfeeding, nutrition, and
immunization regimes that are essential to getting a healthy start in
life.  For example, <a href=""http://www.povertyactionlab.org/partners/seva-mandir"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a survey of Seva Mandir’s partner villages by M.I.T.’s Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a> found that 75%

birth attendants from our partner villages. 
In the 152 villages where these women live and work, they remain the

They perform home visits to women throughout their pregnancy, accompany
them to receive antenatal immunizations, encourage women to deliver at
hospitals and advocate for them there, and can recognize complications and
refer women when necessary.  Where
institutional delivery is not an option, our health workers conduct hygienic
and safe home deliveries using medical kits supplied by Seva Mandir. </span><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b style=""text-align: center;""></b></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><i>Infant Health Workers: </i></p><span style=""text-align: center;"">After birth,

salaries, and medical supplies for our 400 maternal and infant health workers,
benefitting over 6,000 mothers and children per year.  A little goes a long way in rural India – just look at the numbers at right.

Maternal health workers’ kits include medicines,

          Seva Mandir (www.sevamandir.org) has been working in rural Rajasthan for the past 45
years.  We currently work with 360,000
people in 700 of the world’s most impoverished communities where people live on
an average of $0.35 a day. We
take a holistic approach to community development.  Our programs provide critical maternal and
infant health services, ensure families have clean drinking water and can grow
enough food to eat, offer disadvantaged students a quality preschool and
primary education, empower women, and strengthen participation in village level
democracy.  We place paramount
importance, in keeping with Gandhian ideals, on enabling common citizens to
assume responsibility for development work in their community and take
ownership over building a better life for themselves.  
Seva
Mandir has an annual budget of $3.2 million, 250 full time employees, another
1,000 part-time employees who live in its partner villages, and has received
recognition and funding from some of the world’s top organizations such as the
Ford Foundation, MacArthur Foundation and the World Bank.
Friends of Seva Mandir, Inc. (www.friendsofsevamandir.org) is a U.S.
501(c)(3) charitable organization.  It
makes grants  to support Seva Mandir’s programs in India. Contributions from
U.S. taxpayers to Friends of Seva Mandir, Inc. are deductible for  U.S. tax

NEED
In remote
villages, there is a lack of education and awareness surrounding the care
needed during and after pregnancy.  This
is compounded by the prohibitive distance to most government medical
facilities, cultural norms that make it hard for women to talk openly about
their body and pregnancy, and by institutionalized discrimination against
tribal women. As a result, home deliveries by untrained local women are common,
leading to enormously increased risk to both mother and child.  After birth, there is little postnatal care,
even though most maternal deaths happen in the postnatal period, and an equally
huge lack of knowledge surrounding proper breastfeeding, nutrition, and
immunization regimes that are essential to getting a healthy start in
life.  For example, a survey of Seva Mandir’s partner villages by M.I.T.’s Jameel Poverty Action Lab found that 75%
of children were anemic and only 19% were fully immunized. OUR RESPONSEMaternal Health Workers: We provide
training, medical equipment, stipends and supervision to over 300 traditional
birth attendants from our partner villages. 
In the 152 villages where these women live and work, they remain the
primary providers of maternal healthcare. 
They perform home visits to women throughout their pregnancy, accompany
them to receive antenatal immunizations, encourage women to deliver at
hospitals and advocate for them there, and can recognize complications and
refer women when necessary.  Where
institutional delivery is not an option, our health workers conduct hygienic
and safe home deliveries using medical kits supplied by Seva Mandir. Infant Health Workers: After birth,
our 100 infant health workers counsel mothers on critical aspects of newborn
care including breastfeeding, weaning and appropriate nutrition.  They also chart child growth, refer serious
cases of malnutrition to hospitals, and link mothers to Seva Mandir’s
immunization camps (called “the most impressive we have ever evaluated, and probably the one that has saved most lives” by poverty researchers and M.I.T. professors Abhijit Banerjee
and Esther Duflo).  Because our
health workers are from the communities they serve, they are able to establish
strong and trusting relationships with their patients, and greatly influence
their behavior in terms of seeking preventative healthcare.  The acceptance and success of our health
workers is reinforced by our decades-long relationships with villages on
all-around village development.       OUR IMPACT, 2012-13





Our
323 maternal health workers provided ante- and postnatal care for over 4,000 women

Our maternal health workers did more than 2,000 hygienic and safe home deliveries,
and have significantly increased the percentage of safe deliveries in our partner
villages

Our infant
health workers gave 2,000 mothers and newborns counseling and preventative
care throughout the first year of life

This has
resulted in decreased child malnourishment and higher child immunization rates in
our work area

       Pinki Devi, one of our infant health workers, lives and works in a village
called Kochla. 
She recently went to visit a new-born girl, and during her check-up
found that the girl was in the lowest weight grade in her age-growth monitoring
chart.  Pinki discussed and explored the
reasons behind the girl’s poor health with the mother, and counseled her on the importance of exclusive breastfeeding and of keeping the child
warm using a baby warmer (pictured below). Pinki Devi then followed up with regular
home visits to monitor the child’s health. After one month, the child’s weight
increased to 2.8 kgs. This improvement helped boost the morale of the mother
and she began to religiously followed Pinki’s advice. By the end of the second month the child’s weight was 3.5 kgs,
and had increased to 4.5kgs by the end of the third month. The family credits
and thanks Pinki for their child’s healthy recovery from a weak start.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On Thanksgiving evening, 2012, Amber Chandler was driving her kids home from a family dinner when she was involved in a horrible accident.  Her 2 daughters, ages 7 and 6, had to be airlifted, spent many days in ICU and experienced many surgeries.  Amber and her 5 year old son were admitted to the hospital with significant injuries as well.  The girls, especially, have a very long road ahead of them with substantial injuries that will require ongoing care and numerous surgeries.  The seven year old daughter will be in a wheelchair for the forseeable future.  The six year old girl has a nephrostomy bag and a urostomy bag and will require numerous surgeries to (hopefully) repair the extensive damage.  The entire family will need to process the events of that evening and learn how to live their lifes outside of the hospital.  This will, undoubtedly, have huge mental and financial impacts to the whole family.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need and The Impact</h3>
<p>Funds are needed to support the Chandler family in their recovery.  Amber and the children will have extensive medical bills.  Their house will need to altered to accommodate a wheelchair.  The wheelchair needs to be purchased/rented.  Nursing help will be needed.  Amber's car will need to be replaced.  YOU can help this family feel normal and safe once again!  Every penny helps!</p>

<p>Ow! This really hurts. I repeat: Ow! Hopefully, I will be able to recover fully in a couple of months. I have finally earned my own business location and, as much as I hate to ask, would like to get back to serving my clients and community as soon as possible. I'm not looking to make a profit, just to pay my basic bills and keep my salon. I believe in my friends and family, good Pearland people, and no matter what happens, I'm going to make it.  I've been involved in these types of programs in support of some of my other friends, and I know how fulfilling it is to be able to help your friends when they need it.</p>
<p>This was an emergency surgery, which, to my understanding, was necessary to keep me from becoming paralyzed! I was unprepared for this, but I have already been blessed with help from my husband and my grandkids! Even though it was a terrible inconvenience, I can't tell you how much of a relief it is to know that I should not be experiencing anymore numbness in my hands and feet. Praise the Lord!</p>
<p>Furthermore, I feel so blessed, again, to be working with my current landlords who have offered to help me during this tough time with helping me with rent structure and prayers. There is quite a bit working in my favor, but there are still needs that must be met.</p>
<p>So, here's where the money will go over the next two months (anticipated recupertation time):</p>
<p>1. Salon rental @ $205/week</p>
<p>2. Car payment @ $389/month</p>
<p>3. Light bill @ $130/month</p>

<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>In the aftermath of the disaster, we need support for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Health education</strong> to prevent cholera, promote sanitation, and ensure we mitigate the risk of disease outbreak</li>
<li>
<strong>Supplies for women and children</strong> who are most marginalized--soaps, sanitary pads, clothes, diapers, etc. </li>
<li>
<strong>Basic food and water</strong> for our counselors working 24 hours to provide support to those who lost their homes. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The people of Western Uganda face poverty on a daily basis, subsisting on the small food they can grow, their land, and the animals they rear.</p>
<p>But now, in the aftermath of the flooding, all of those have been washed away. The people of the communities affected have lost everything--their clothes, their land, their crops, and their homes. Most importantly, they have lost hope. </p>
<p><strong>Your support is needed to help these people recover all that they have lost, including their pride and hope. </strong></p>

You can donate online, or via mobile money or in-kind donations. For more information, email info@acodeuvganda.org

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Never Feel Alone Again,... Someone's Always on the Other End!</p>
<p>This is all about getting the real security the other pendants offer but don't deliver.</p>
<p>I know what you thinking…the market is flooded with these kinds of emergency lifelines, and you are right, however there is nothing on the market like this today. This is a full functioning cordless telephone that utilizes the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">proven</span> cordless telephone technology which immediately offers extended range with 2 way voice communications from the pendant/communicator. In addition;  big button, large LCD display, 40+dB volume boost for the hearing impaired, and an additional emergency  lifeline button on the back of the phone. This is the only system like this in the world.</p>
<p>Rick Greene, the founder, moved to a retirement community to be near his parents. He thought all was great until one day his father fell in the garage and that was when Rick learned the real limitations of the ""I've Fallen and I Can't Get Up"" devices. There was no real two way voice communication from the pendant, no one to help the person stay calm and, the kicker, you pretty much had to fall in the same room as the base. Luckily the signal went through but his father could not in any way communicate with the emergency technicians on the other end. At that moment he realized people were being taken advantage of, not offered any real freedom just a slightly wider radius to be worried in. He scoured the technology all over the world to find a system that made sense. Now it is his personal goal to get these systems to the marketplace so that everyone has the opportunity for freedom and safety. So that any person can know they are never alone in their home and surrounding area.</p>
<p>By sponsoring an elderly person you get them a year of 24/7 monitoring service as well as the equipment for them to live in the security of their home and neighborhood and they will experience true <em>Peace of Mind With the Touch of a Button</em>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $60,000 to get this new state of the art 2 way voice communicator technology product launched in the United States. Why be in the dark ages with an analogue outdated emergency alert system when the new digital DECT 6.0, 1.9GHz products will be available for your loved ones now? Two way voice communication with a trained emergency call center technician directly from the COMMUNICATOR around the neck when you are in or around your house.</p>
<p>Unlike a personal emergency response pendant, which does not allow you to hold a meaningful conversation with the other end, you have no idea how long it will take them to respond or if they have even understood what is wrong. Pendant is an outdated word in the world of antique jewelry and these other systems are just as outdated and useless. The cordless phone allows real voice communications. This new system allows you to stay on the line with the emergency responders so you are no longer in the dark wondering if someone is really coming. The technology reaches through walls, the garage, front yard, back yard, out to the mailbox and to your neighbor's house 2 doors down. This is cutting edge and far surpasses the analogue systems with a range 3x less than this new system; ultimately giving the wearer more freedom so movement does not have to be limited. The user can go on with daily life knowing they will be heard. Did you realize that the old systems truly require you to fall in the same room as the ""system"" in order to have any type of communication? In the days of pocket sized computer cell phones, this is an outrage!</p>
<p>Another amazing feature is the ability to place the communicator on its base for recharging every night. There is no concern about battery compartments or other hard to handle replacements. Some of these systems are designed in a way that is spring loaded, causing older hands extensive trouble if the batteries run out. if the battery ever runs low on this system a voice reminder will remind them to charge their communicator. Each person owns their equipment so they are never forced into upgrades or higher prices for the services provided.</p>
<p>By supporting the campaign you will provide</p>
<p>-250 units to the elderly in need</p>
<p>-A year’s worth of 24/7 trained monitoring service for each person</p>
<p>-They will own the equipment forever and can continue the service as long as they need.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will provide units to as many people as possible with the funding we do raise. Our goal is to make living alone a safer endeavor for every elderly person who is capable of it. There is no reason they should live in fear and they should never be alone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By sponsoring an elderly person you are changing their life! They can live in their home and be safe. There are many things you don't think about until they happen to you or someone you love. As you age, your ability to take care of yourself is compromised due to balance issues, heart conditions or other problem health areas. Because of this, people are often ripped from their homes and forced into uncomfortable and undesirable living situations. This campaign, this product, can change this for hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Although we are recognized by a few Medicaid programs nationwide, not one Medicare program acknowledges the importance of a life saving device such as ours and as a result there are many needy seniors who can't afford a communicator. By getting this product on the market we hope to be recognized by Medicare and begin providing units to all those in need. We intend to continue our charitable contributions as well once we are acknowledged by Medicare. Our ultimate goal is to provide a free unit to a person in need for every two units purchased either by an individual or insurance company. We won't be happy until every person who is at risk has a consistent and reliable lifeline to the outside world so they can go on with their lives with confidence.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you can't afford to sponsor an elderly person in whole, any dollar amount will help. If you can't afford anything right now, we know times are tough, then spread the word! Help us reach others who might be able to see the value in this campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools in order to help us reach our goal and become a featured campaign...this will only grow our outreach and allow us to keep everyone safe.</p>

<h3><em><strong>Thanks for visiting!  Please visit again soon, we'll have a video up asap!<br/></strong></em></h3>
<p><em><strong>We are NuNa Wellness - an integrative holistic wellness clinic in Madison's Downtown area.  <br/></strong></em></p>
<p><em>Our mission is to create a nurturing and empowering space where we will provide quality, integrative care, and where we will raise funds to help those who are suffering and can't afford the treatment they need.</em></p>
<p>We recognize THREE NEEDS in our community:</p>
<p><strong>1) A way to give people who are disabled and/or unable to work access to holistic wellness care, despite financial hardship</strong></p>
<p>After living with a disability in my early 20s, I am intimately aware of the struggles faced when one is unable to work.  I also know that very often, traditional western medical treatments offer little hope for those living with chronic pain disorders, and holistic, natural care is needed to recover true wellness.   <strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Better opportunities for fair income and personal growth for holistic health care providers</strong></p>
<p>I witness a great deal of new massage therapists and yoga instructors on the scene getting taken advantage of because they are eager to work, or because they have no personal knowledge of business operations.  I want to create a place for them to build their clientelle, their confidence, and their income!</p>
<p><strong>3) An uplifting environment for healers to collaborate and synergize, allowing for greater healing of their patients<br/></strong></p>
<p><em>Natural medicine works synergistically.  That means that the mind and body work together, and must be addressed from many angles for effective healing.  Our clinic will encourage a spirit of collaboration with regular team trainings, community workshops, and integrative treatments.  The more we work together, the greater good we can provide to our community, and the stronger our business will be.<br/></em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h2><strong>By supporting this project, you will be part of something amazing! </strong></h2>
<div> </div>
<ul>
<li>You will help create a nurturing and empowering space for the community.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You will be helping improve the job market, and the workplace environment for many healing professionals, who are often taken advantage of and not paid what their work is worth. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>More importantly, you'll be helping to set the foundation for an inclusive health care model for ALL. </strong></li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<div>By creating a non-profit fund, we will be able to donate a portion of our clinic's proceeds to those struggling to afford holistic treatment.  We will be able to offer comprehensive treatment options for people in our community who are dealing with debilitating chronic illness or other health issues keeping them from being able to afford the care they need. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>That means that people who are so sick that they are not able to work will, for the first time, have a resource to receive much needed holistic care.  We will take applications on a case-by-case basis, and review each applicant based on financial need, health needs, and the resources we have available. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each applicant who is chosen by our team will receive a treatment package of a variety of healing modalities.  We believe in integrative medicine because the body is an intricately connected and affected organism that requires care from many angles, and over a period of time.  By providing multiple treatments to individual applicants, we believe our resources will be used most effectively. </div>
<h3>Our goal will be to donate 75 free treatments each month by the end of our first year!! </h3>
<h3>This is totally do-able, if we are able to expand our clinic from the two rooms we have now, to a fully integrative 6 room facility. </h3>
<h2>Can you imagine all the people who are suffering with chronic pain that could live<em> fuller, more satisfying lives!?  </em><br/><br/><em>How many parents </em>who are living with chronic disease could finally be more a part of their children's lives?  <br/><br/><em>Soldiers</em> disabled from service could learn methods to alleviate symptoms of PTSD and get natural therapies to help physical injuries heal!</h2>
<h3>I found the perfect location, the perfect space, and have a team of talented and passionate holistic care practitioners.  We just need some startup funds!</h3>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you can spare some money, this is what we'll use it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The money will make it possible for us to expand our lease in a prime retail location with a private entrance, parking, soundproofed walls, and really great energy :)</li>
<li>We will furnish the new clinic to make you feel at home when you visit, with cozy furniture and inviting ambiance.  We plan to use locally sourced sustainable items when possible.</li>
<li>We will paint the facility to enhance the healing effects of the space</li>
<li>We will use some of the money to roll out a fierce but friendly advertising campaign about a month before our grand opening to ensure the clinic's success</li>
<li>We will invite the community to a fun-filled appreciation event for our Grand Opening, and of course, have a private, pre-opening party for contributors!</li>
<li><strong>If we reach our goal, we'll also invest in a Full Spectrum Infrared Sauna to enhance clinic services!!!  If our goal is reached, EVERY donor will receive a free treatment in the sauna!*******</strong></li>

<hr/><h2><strong><span class=""firstword"">Data that Drives You</span></strong></h2>
<p><em><span class=""firstword"">""I</span> was already on pole, then by half a second and then one second and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car."" -  <span class=""topictitle"">Ayrton Senna</span></em></p>
<p><strong>You didn’t spend all that time and money to come in second. You play to win, you always have.</strong></p>
<p>A small change in performance can be the difference between winning and not. This is true for driver or car. If you’re a good driver in a good car, it’s hard to know exactly what change is needed. Maybe it’s tire pressure, a suspension tweak, a different line through corner 5 and 6, who knows? Occasionally you stumble across the solution, but much of the time it goes unnoticed or unresolved. None of this is a mystery to a professional race team. They know exactly what’s going on. They’ve spent the money. <em>They’ve got all the data</em>.</p>
<p>If you had this kind of data, if you knew exactly what was going on, you could make the change, big or small, that makes the difference.</p>
<p>Lucky you! Collecting that data just got a lot more affordable.</p>

<h2>Production Plan</h2>
<hr/><h3>Better Faster Stronger</h3>
<p>Since 2008 Autosport Labs's misson has been to develop affordable, open technologies for race and street applications, starting with the popular <a href=""http://autosportlabs.net/Megajolt_Lite_Jr."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Megajolt</a> crank fired ignition system.  </p>
<p>The Megajolt was designed to solve an individual problem and then grew into a global business. We went from ecking out a small space in our garage to expanding to commercial space, where our manufacturing equipment resides side by side with our test benches: race cars in various states of build. As with Megajolt, we are our own first customer, and we're just as proud of the community of customer users supporting and sharing with each other as we are of the products that got us here.</p>
<p>We come to you, Indigogo community, to help us get Race Capture Pro into as many hands (cars) as possible as fast as possible, to create the rich and robust user community to share data, collaborate on command scripts, cheer over victories. This is the real value of Race Capture Pro, and crowd-funding seemed to us the best way to launch an open source project, to hit the track at full speed.  </p>
<h2>About the Autosport Labs Team</h2>
<p>Founded by Brent Picasso and Kelley Picasso in 2008, Autosport Labs is passionate about developing open source technology for motorsport and street applications. We started off small, providing kits for the early version of the Megajolt Ignition controller, and developed our knowledge of what it takes to design and deliver across the entire product lifecycle.</p>
<p>Along the way we developed the expertise and capacity to do assembly of our own electronics. This gives us a tremendous advantage in both agility and removing variables in the process of delivering finished items. In our Lynnwood, WA facility we have a full range of electronic assembly equipment including a solder stencil printer, robotic pick and place machine, and reflow and through hole solder machines. </p>

Data that Drives You
""I was already on pole, then by half a second and then one second and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car."" -  Ayrton Senna
You didn’t spend all that time and money to come in second. You play to win, you always have.
A small change in performance can be the difference between winning and not. This is true for driver or car. If you’re a good driver in a good car, it’s hard to know exactly what change is needed. Maybe it’s tire pressure, a suspension tweak, a different line through corner 5 and 6, who knows? Occasionally you stumble across the solution, but much of the time it goes unnoticed or unresolved. None of this is a mystery to a professional race team. They know exactly what’s going on. They’ve spent the money. They’ve got all the data.
If you had this kind of data, if you knew exactly what was going on, you could make the change, big or small, that makes the difference.
Lucky you! Collecting that data just got a lot more affordable.
Meet Race Capture Pro
Race Capture Pro collects data. Lots of it. It’s a powerful, multi-channel data acquisition and control system designed to be installed in your street or race car.

We’ve packed it with advanced features normally reserved for high end systems.
Race Capture Pro puts at your disposal:

High Frequency 10Hz GPS for accurately tracking your position in the world
Precision 3 Axis digital accelerometer to measure G-forces in all directions

Yaw Sensor to measure car rotation and detect oversteer and understeer conditions

Sensor Inputs to measure engine temperature, throttle / brake position, boost pressure, wheel speed, RPM and more

Hardware expansion to add OBD-II and CAN interface upgrades
All in a compact, rugged enclosure you'd be proud to show off.
What you can Log
Here's just an example of what kind of data you can record with Race Capture Pro: 

Software
A data acquisition system like this wouldn't be complete without software. Race Capture Pro includes software which allows you to configure the hardware settings as well as perform analysis on your racing data. Read on for more details!

Control your world
Race Capture Pro doesn't only collect data; it can process it in real-time and control devices on your race car.
With Race Capture Pro’s control capability you can do things that range from simple to sophisticated. Things such as:


Activate a fan when a temperature threshold is exceeded
Log data at a higher resolution near a certain GPS coordinate, like at that one problematic corner of the track

Control an intercooler sprayer based on temperature and boost level

Intercept and re-map an OEM sensor to override stock engine management behavior
Experiment with active aerodynamics by controlling a wing based on GPS velocity
Lay down a thick smoke screen against your competitors ;)
How does this work?
We've embedded a simple yet powerful scripting language right on board called Lua, which lets you easily create commands to read sensors and activate outputs based on logic you define. It’s easy, and you don’t have to be a firmware developer!
And if you need help getting something to work, our community will get you started with sample scripts, help and reference - sharing at its best.

 
Open to the Core
Race Capture Pro isn’t just a powerful data acquisition and control system; It’s an Open Source Hardware and Software project. We will open the design for your inspection, tweaking, and customization. No secret file formats and no expensive, proprietary add-ons. Frankly, we think this is silly and it’s time that a project like this exists to serve the enthusiasts first. And we’re excited to share it and see where we all can take it together!
When will we release source code and hardware design files? Our plan is to release source code and designs upon fulfillment of the last funded Race Capture Pro unit, before we make it available in our regular store and via distributors.

<h3>Raul's Story</h3>
</div>
<div>Raul was born in Barlad, Romania, on October 19th 2009. He was born with a severe form of the rare genetic condition Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), as was his sister who passed away at one month old. He lived in the hospital for four months, when he was then transferred to Tutova Clinic. I met Raul the day he arrived in Tutova, and immediately fell in love. At the time he was in very poor condition, and EB was not widely known in the area. I was in contact with doctors in the United States during my time in Romania to help find ways to improve his quality of life. Once home I began working on getting Raul a medical visa to come to the U.S. for a short time to receive more expansive testing and wound care. Raul was loved by his caretakers in Romania, but due to the lack of knowledge about EB he was isolated, and did not receive optimal care. After a lengthy, year long, process, Raul was denied a medical visa by the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest. I came home from Romania after the denial, and began the application process for his Humanitarian Parole. Thankfully, this was granted in a matter of weeks, and last July we were able to bring Raul here from Romania! We spent almost five months at Colorado Children's Hospital receiving care for Raul from their EB specialists, and are now home in Boston. While there is no cure for EB, Raul has improved greatly with a feeding tube for nutrition and extensive wound care! We are currently working through some of his developmental delays with Early Intervention (PT, OT, Speech).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Raul has struggled greatly, mainly with infection in his many non-healing wounds, yet he faces everything with great courage! We were finally able to obtain a biopsy to determine his sub-type of EB, which will help him to take part in trials working towards a cure for EB, yet the results were not 100% conclusive. We know he has severe dystrophic EB, but it appears he may have multiple subtypes/mutations. To get a more accurate portrayal, we now need to do DNA testing. Because of his immigration status, Raul is not able to have insurance, so we need to pay our of pocket for this, which is why we need your help! Please help us to help Raul!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>-The lab, GeneDX, has offered us a discount due to Raul's situation. This brings the cost of the testing from $6,000 down to just over $3,000. We will also have to pay for shipping, but that should not be too expensive.</p>
<p>-As a perk, we will send one of Raul's awareness t-shirts to the top 10 donors! These shirts are also available to be purchased <a href=""http://www.romanianbutterfly.com/p/shirt-store.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> for those who are interested.</p>
<p>We will continue to fundraise until we reach our goal, as it is important to us that Raul receive this testing!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
This testing will give us the information we need to fully understand his condition, and to enroll Raul in future EB trials. These trials will not only help him, but will help future children born with this horrible condition!</div>

Raul was born in Barlad, Romania, on October 19th 2009. He was born with a severe form of the rare genetic condition Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), as was his sister who passed away at one month old. He lived in the hospital for four months, when he was then transferred to Tutova Clinic. I met Raul the day he arrived in Tutova, and immediately fell in love. At the time he was in very poor condition, and EB was not widely known in the area. I was in contact with doctors in the United States during my time in Romania to help find ways to improve his quality of life. Once home I began working on getting Raul a medical visa to come to the U.S. for a short time to receive more expansive testing and wound care.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi! I am Kathryn, I am 29 years old and I have been suffering from a debilitating invisible chronic illness for more than 2 years. After being told I had Lupus, or possibly Rheumatoid Arthritis I agreed to a blood test. It came back negative and I was then referred to a psychiatrist. Many blood tests later I finally had an answer: Lyme Disease, Babesiosis and Bartonella. My titers were so high I was even considered positive according to strict CDC standards. I was relieved to hear this, after all Lyme disease is very easy to cure...right?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately so much time had passed between transmission and diagnosis, the bacteria had disseminated and crossed into my brain. I now have late stage (also known as Chronic) Lyme Disease. I would also soon find that Lyme Disease is incredibly controversial and despite strong medical and scientific evidence to the contrary, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) denies the existence of Lyme disease that persists after 28 days of antibiotic treatment. The IDSA is who insurance companies listen to when it comes to covering treatment. The Social Security Administration also follows their guidelines when reviewing applications for disability. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Before I became sick, I had a promising career in the Film Industry. I had done research for movies that are now in theaters. I also sat in the writers room and helped craft the first 6 episodes of a TV show that will debut in March. I spent my free time volunteering with children and at homeless shelters. I conducted fundraisers to help victims of Human Trafficking. I played the violin and had an organic garden. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I also loved hiking and backpacking and would try to hike as much as possible on the weekends. Symptomatic but not yet diagnosed, I completed a 144.7 mile section hike of the Pacific Crest Trail. Those that hiked with me can attest to the fact that something was wrong. It has always been a dream of mine to complete a thru hike (2,650 miles) of the Pacific Crest Trail. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In February of 2011 my illness became so severe that I had no choice but to quit my job. I immediately filed for Social Security Disability and went on temporary disability in the meantime. Despite treatment, I seemed to be steadily getting more and more sick. It became clear that my particular case was beyond the knowledge of my Dr and after making a few calls, I became the patient of one of the top Lyme Dr's in the Country. By the time I had my first appointment with him, I was a complete mess. Here is a list of my symptoms:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Severe joint, bone and muscle pain (8 out of 10)</p>
<p>Brain Fog</p>
<p>Memory Loss (I routinely forget simple things like my phone number or where I live)</p>
<p>Seizures</p>
<p>Stroke Symptoms</p>
<p>Tachycardia</p>
<p>Migraines</p>
<p>Severe Fatigue</p>
<p>Depression and Suicidal fantasies</p>
<p>Tremors in the hands and legs</p>
<p>Digestive issues</p>
<p>Hair loss</p>
<p>Panic attacks</p>
<p>The list goes on...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In June I had a minor surgery where they placed a port-a-cath in my chest. I now am able to do home IV infusions. I do up to three infusions of various medications a day. An alarm is constantly going off to remind me to take a medication or supplement. I spend most of my time in bed, unable to move. Right before Christmas I was hospitalized  as I could not walk, my legs had become too weak and the pain too great. I left the hospital with a walker. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise funds for treatment because I lost my appeal with Social Security Disability. Despite letters from several Dr's and tests that prove my dire medical situation, SSDI has determined that I am not disabled. I am awaiting a hearing where I will go before a judge and plead my case. They are so backlogged I must wait up to a year for my court date. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My temporary disability ran out in August and I have gone through my savings trying to keep a roof over my head, insurance paid and treatment covered. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I can no longer do this alone - <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;"">I need your help!</span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;"">At this time I face losing my health insurance, homelessness and ultimately leaving treatment for a curable disease. Without treatment I will continue to get worse. Without treatment this disease can be fatal. </span></p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Nicole Teufel and I am a certified yoga teacher with Yoga Alliance (RYT). I have created a weekly volunteer yoga workshop for Vista Maria. Vista Maria is a home for girl's from 11yrs-18yrs  old who have been removed from thier home for various reasons such as volience, neglect or other trauma. These young girls are in need of healing and I have chosen to offer what I can to them- Yoga. I have also earned a Writing Certificate from the University of Michigan- Dearborn, and I will be incorporating journaling and other forms of creative writing to offer the girls skills to assist in thier healing.</p>
<p>The project will offer each girl 2 hours of yoga/writing workshop per week for at least eight-weeks. This will give them a strong understanding of yoga postures and breathing techniques, and how it can benefit them emotionally as well as physically. The project will also give the girls ample time to develop creative writing skillls that can assists them throughout thier life in manging thier emotions and self-healing.</p>
<p>Vista Maria houses 160 girls. I hope to be able to provide them each with thier own yoga mat and composition book for decoration and journaling. I have found yoga mats for $10 at Target, and T.J. Maxx. I hope that we can pull together to help raise the funds needed to buy 160 mats, as well as 160 composition books and supplies to decorate them.</p>
<p>I believe that the privilege we are given in our life via education, money, or other gifts should be used in part to help those who have not been so privilegded. I understand this practice to be one way to slowly improve life for all people. It feels good to give what you can, and it feels good to get what you need. It is that simple. I wish to give yoga, and my time...can you help me give them the mats they need to make this opprotinity real for these 160 young girls?</p>
<p><br/>Any additional funds raised will be split among the 160 girls for thier personal spending...they deserve a little extra love :) and it will be quite a wonderful surprise I think!</p>
<p><br/>If you would like, please visit the Vista Maria website to see what the home's history is and why the girls need this healing. Please note, all donations for THIS project must go to this Indiegogo campaign in order to help with the workshop. If you would like to donate additional funds directly to the home, that can be done via thier website. <a href=""http://www.vistamaria.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vistamaria.org</a></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Yoga and writing have both been proven to be incredible tools for self-healing. The girls at Vista Maria could only be there for six months (possibly less) or perhaps up to two years. This means that it is important for them to get as much as they can to help them while they are at the home. Vista Maria's goal is to work with the Michigan court system to get the girls back into their home, or a new good home. I want to give them something they can rely on for comfort and assistance even after they leave the girls home. Because of what some of these girls have endured, they will need much longer recovery time than Vista Maria can usually offer...it is so critical that they have these tools for when they must leave...and their own yoga mat to take with them :)</p>

Please get the word out to all your peeps! This is a time-sensitive project and I would love to get the goal met, and the mats out to them asap! :)</div>

<p><strong>Nicholas Svaikauskas</strong></p>
<p>Nicholas has been training for this season since Canadian Nationals last year. He has put countless hours into skiing and shooting training. This year he was excited to compete in the Junior World Trails in Canmore, Alberta, the first race of the season for him.</p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>On the 31st of December he and other members of Biathlon Ontario flew halfway across the country from Ontario to Alberta to be able to acclimatize to the higher altitude before the race. Nicholas has been working hard to raise enough money to pay for expensive equipment and flights. After three days of excellent training in the beautiful mountains, Nick had the misfortune of wiping out on the way back to the chalet, and snapped one of his very expensive race skis.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Now Nick needs a new pair of skis and he doesn’t have the cash, seeing as he already spent most of his funds on the tickets out here. He will buy a new pair of race skis locally, and your contributions will help cover only the cost of those skis.</p>
<p>If he doesn’t have enough to cover them, he will have to borrow a pair of skis, but race skis involve a huge number of variables, including weight, height, temperature ranges, and the skis shape, so it is difficult to find a perfect match.</p>
<p>Any left over money will go straight to his racing fund and pay for other race fees and the trip to Nationals.</p>
<p>This is quite short notice, but part of the sponsorship package I had previously prepared included pictures from races I can send out, and I will keep a race blog with updates during Junior World trials and the rest of the race season.</p>

<p>Three amazing memorial services were held for Obo this past weekend – and what memorable services they were – all so different and heartfelt. We truly thank all of you for coming out to celebrate &amp; remember Obo’s life with us.<br/><br/> On Friday night the Ghanaian community organized a traditional Ghanaian wake keeping – that included much drumming, dancing, wonderful food and pageantry. Our speakers honored Obo on behalf of the Sierra Leone community, the Nigerian community and the Ghanaian community. On Saturday evening we held a public memorial at Lewis &amp; Clark Agnes Flanagan Chapel where we were able to remember Obo’s contributions to many areas of the music and the arts with a multitude of beautiful performances and spoken tributes. On Sunday we were able to memorialize Obo in the faith he practiced <span class=""caps"">SGI</span> Buddhism held at the Oregon Buddhist Center. <br/><br/> We, his family, want to thank all of you who have shared your memories of Obo either with us directly, through cards or by posting on the Caring Bridge site. We encourage you to continue to post memories and stories of your time with Obo on <a href=""http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/oboaddy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.caringbridge.org/visit/oboaddy </a>as we plan to put these posts into a book to take to Ghana to share at the large memorial service to be held in Accra. (Please do not donate funds on the Caring Bridge website).<br/><br/><strong>After all of these wonderful remembrances here in Portland we have one goal left to attain for Obo. We are now in the final stretch of fundraising to allow us to honor Obo’s legacy with a traditional ceremony in Ghana appropriate for his position as a Chief in the Sowutuom region of Accra. For this ceremony, Susan and a family member will need to fly to Ghana for traditional services as Obo’s title of Chief is passed from him to the next chosen person. </strong><br/><strong> Please help us reach this goal by Saturday, October 20th. Any amount will help – we are very close to our goal.</strong></p>
<p>For those who have already contributed – we sincerely thank you for your generosity. Your gifts enabled us to present these memorial services in Portland and to assist with covering the expenses associated with Obo’s illness.</p>
</div>
<p>Obo worked as long as his body allowed, realizing that continuing to play and listen to his music was cathartic as he moved through this final step of this illness. His most recent performance was August 19 with Portland Taiko at the Mt. Scott Community Center. He is still hoped to record one last song he wrote at Falcon Studios.<br/> <br/>A vigorous supporter of world music, Obo has been extremely active in bringing that style of music to Portland and Oregon, where he has lived with his wife Susan since 1978. Through numerous in-school residencies, performances and workshops, Obo has affected hundreds of thousands of lives in the Pacific Northwest and beyond. It’s difficult to find a child who grew up in Portland in the 80s and 90s that doesn’t hold fond memories of Obo and his drumming.<br/><br/>Obo's charismatic spirit, rapid-fire hands, and powerful voice have led him to receive the National Heritage Fellowship Award from the National Endowment for the Arts under President Bill Clinton, the Governors Award for the Arts in Oregon, The Masters Fellowship from the Regional Arts and Culture Council and the Masters Fellowship from the Oregon Arts Commission. <br/><br/>He was on the faculty at Lewis &amp; Clark College until his passing, and was the artistic director of the Obo Addy Legacy Project, formerly known as the Homowo African Arts and Cultures, a not-for-profit organization founded by the Addys in 1986 as a virtual cultural center with offerings in schools, parks, community centers and performance venues all over the country. The organization put on an annual Homowo Festival in Portland for nearly 15 years with music and dance, food, vendors and art demonstrations from various countries within the continent of Africa and the African Diaspora.<br/><br/>ABOUT OBO ADDY<br/>Born in 1936 in Accra, the capital of Ghana, Addy is the son of a Wonche medicine man, and by the age of six was designated as a drummer. Addy’s family was part of the Ga ethnic group, and he was raised playing in the musical traditions of the Ga people.<br/><br/>Addy got his professional start in Ghana by playing with the Joe Kelly Band, the Ghana Broadcasting Band, and the Farmer’s Council Band, which played popular American and European music. In 1969, he was hired by the Arts Council of Ghana as a Ga master, and he received his first international exposure at the Munich Summer Olympics in 1972. Addy lived in London and spent six years touring internationally until 1978, when he moved to Portland. There he met and married his wife Susan who began managing his career.<br/><br/>Addy has maintained two different ensembles: Okropong, which means “eagle” in the Ga language, and Kukrudu, which is Ga for “earthquake.“ Okropong relies on traditional instrumentation, using hand and stick drums, bells, and shakers to create a layered rhythmic effect. Dance is also an important part of the performance, along with singing. Kukrudu is an eight-piece African jazz group that relies on a mix of European and African instruments. <br/><br/>For more information on Obo's music, visit <a href=""http://www.oboaddylegacyproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.oboaddylegacyproject.org</a>.<br/><br/></p></div>","Three amazing memorial services were held for Obo this past weekend – and what memorable services they were – all so different and heartfelt. We truly thank all of you for coming out to celebrate & remember Obo’s life with us. On Friday night the Ghanaian community organized a traditional Ghanaian wake keeping – that included much drumming, dancing, wonderful food and pageantry. Our speakers honored Obo on behalf of the Sierra Leone community, the Nigerian community and the Ghanaian community. On Saturday evening we held a public memorial at Lewis & Clark Agnes Flanagan Chapel where we were able to remember Obo’s contributions to many areas of the music and the arts with a multitude of beautiful performances and spoken tributes. On Sunday we were able to memorialize Obo in the faith he practiced SGI Buddhism held at the Oregon Buddhist Center.  We, his family, want to thank all of you who have shared your memories of Obo either with us directly, through cards or by posting on the Caring Bridge site. We encourage you to continue to post memories and stories of your time with Obo on www.caringbridge.org/visit/oboaddy as we plan to put these posts into a book to take to Ghana to share at the large memorial service to be held in Accra. (Please do not donate funds on the Caring Bridge website).After all of these wonderful remembrances here in Portland we have one goal left to attain for Obo. We are now in the final stretch of fundraising to allow us to honor Obo’s legacy with a traditional ceremony in Ghana appropriate for his position as a Chief in the Sowutuom region of Accra. For this ceremony, Susan and a family member will need to fly to Ghana for traditional services as Obo’s title of Chief is passed from him to the next chosen person.  Please help us reach this goal by Saturday, October 20th. Any amount will help – we are very close to our goal.

<h3>Lily Dahl's heart surgery campaign</h3>
<p>I am asking for your support on behalf of Lily Dahl. I am Lily's Grandmother, Dawn. Lily was born May 31st missing two heart valves which created the need for close to 4 weeks in the hospital far from home. Update: physicians will also be building a wall currently missing in the center of her heart...</p>
<p>Here is the major <strong>difficulty:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lily was born with multiple heart defects<br/></strong></li>
<li>Lily's family lives on an island in Hawaii that does not have <strong>a hospital with specialized instruments and facilities for teeny tiny hearts</strong> that newborn and small children need along with skilled pediatric cardilolgists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before 6 months of age (when congestive heart failure begins for this condition), the family: Lily, her mother and possibly her father and two year old sister will need to <strong>fly to Portland OR  and stay for her recovery</strong> where pediatric surgeons are skilled and practiced at open heart surgeries and have the required facilities. (SCARY for grandmothers to think about) This is just one of the needs that exist for Lily but it is the most pressing and will arrive the soonest.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here are the biggest needs:</p>
<p>We would like to <strong>support the kids  with money</strong> (ok they are 30 year olds...I shouldn't call them kids lol) past the amounts we, as family have each pledged, to get Lily <strong>to the mainland</strong> and for the family to have <strong>ways to get around</strong>. We think there is a <strong>Ronald McDonad House</strong> available but if all <strong>rooms</strong> <strong>are taken</strong> we will have to make other plans.</p>
<p>Although the family planned for Mom to have time off from work to attend to Lily, the needs have <strong>swamped their budget and the month in the hospital</strong> after her birth set them back financially. There will be more of the same in the next few months with only a short time for work and recovery.</p>
<p>A trip to the mainland was NOT anywhere in their plans and in addition <strong>Lily must be flown from</strong> Big Island, Hawaii to Manoa, Oahu monthly until her surgery, for assessments by the doctors there and probably for some time after.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have had a sick or special needs child in your life you have valuable insight the kids need and we hope you will encourage them with ideas as well as any funds you may contribute. Every dollar and word of encouragement counts.  </li>
<li>As a fund raiser for Florida Children's charities I am aware of the toll on family life and impact on finances brought on by a need like this. It's killing me to sit here on the East Coast but fund raising is my contribution. If you are moved but cannot contribute please consider helping me get the word out.</li>
<li>Anyone who can donate airline miles please contact me at <a href=""mailto:Avonsalesdt@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> at Indiegogo and we will get a plan going. I am aware of United, Hawaiian and possibly soon Southwest although I'm not sure that's in place yet</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute right now, prayers, encouragement and publicity about the need is most valuable as the time is short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please Pray! As you send the link around please pause to pray for Lily and her parents as well as her sister who has been without her parents for the first time in her short life.</li>
<li>Exciting news! If you know or are a Marine art collector we have been given the go ahead to offer copies of the dolphin painting ""Side By Side"" of a mother and baby dolphin for a larger donation.  A smaller size giclee is available for a one thousand dollar donation and a larger size for two thousand.  The giclee is sent rolled in a tube for you to have framed the way you want. (Any negotiation within those amounts are possible as well)</li>

<p>Justus Weijagye are my names.I live in Uganda</p>
<p>On 26th September last year, I was involved in a road traffic accident (RTA).</p>
<p>It left me with a fracture of the left knee joint, some deep wounds and minor injuries on other parts of the body especially the limbs.</p>
<p>As of now I have partially recovered after multiple treatments and of course involved personal expenses given the nature of the health system in our country where much of the medical care is financed by self and not government and I am in no health insurance scheme.</p>
<p>At the moment I need some operation on the left knee to remove foreign bodies and re-handling of the fracture.</p>
<p>I am a medical worker by profession, a radiographer. I am also an entrepreneur and a human rights activist as well apart from being a mere member of the working class.</p>
<p>In my life I have done much for self improvement and well being and as well being of others both near me and from far.</p>
<p>I have donated blood, provided food and clothing materials to the very needy.</p>
<p>I have helped many members of the working class to organize themselves and secure their rights at work and out of work.</p>
<p>Provided free accommodation, food and drinks to many travelers traveling at very minimum costs an those that become ill or sick across the way.</p>
<p>I have helped many members of the working class to get skills especially in photography, income generating projects, computer applications and many others.</p>
<p>As a medical worker I have provided voluntary services to those who cannot afford to pay for them and given free medical advice to many ignorant and ill people.</p>
<p>I have paid school fees for some needy students and orphans as well as struggled and got education sponsorship for others to mention but a few.</p>
<p>I am therefore calling for humanitarian support to regain my health by supporting and contributing to my medical bills.</p>
<p>I need USD 800 to clear the already remaining unpaid bills and also USD 1200 to move to the national referral hospital some 400km from where I live and get the operation and treatment I need as well as related expenses such as meals, drinks, nursing care etc.</p>
<p>This totals to USD 2000.</p>
<p>I have so far raised USD 1002 as follows:</p>
<p>Funds from previous campaign (UBUNTU) USD 622</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>For the past 6 years, I have been teaching yoga at a local recreation center. My mission is to create community-based classes that are high quality and also affordable. I really believe that yoga should be accessible and not only a luxury available to few. Due to declining circumstances at the city and recreation center, the environment I have been teaching in has become increasingly unsuitable. I think that there is a middle ground--again, I am not looking for luxury, but do want to provide a safe and clean environment where people can heal, and create lasting health and enjoyment through yoga.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have decided to move my classes out of the city recreation center and rent a space to teach in several hours per week. I will be running the classes based on a sliding scale, meaning that people will pay for class according to what they can afford. My larger hope is that this is a first step towards a business that continues to create opportunities that are affordable. I am passionate about making spaces where people can create, organize, play, do inner work and work through the body that is so essential to living consciously. I think that more spaces like that are needed.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help these classes move to a better situation. It will subsidize the costs of running the class allowing students to participate who cannot pay very much. In the past, these low cost classes have been subsidized by city funds, but I am now hoping to create a community support system in new ways. If you are local and plan to attend classes, your contribution will be to your own benefit as well. I really feel these classes will be of great service.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I have set a goal of $2000 which reflects the start up costs of making this move. This number includes the purchase of eco-friendly supplies (yoga blocks, straps, and blankets) that will last for a long time, funds a bit of advertising, and covers the first 2 months of rent. Money received won't be used for any purposes other than these. If I do not reach this funding goal, I will go forward as best possible with whatever funds I gather. The main purpose of asking for this funding is to have a strong start to get the supplies and resources necessary to make these classes self-sustaining, as I do not have this much of my own money to spend at this time.<br/><br/>The perks below offer you ways to get some yoga yourself while giving to others. They reflect discounted rates for classes, so that you are getting a deal by helping me get started. The perks also give you ways to share information on your links or services with others.<br/><p><br/></p>

<p><strong>HEALTH AND FITNESS FOCUSED</strong><br/>2 out of 3 people do not drink enough water a day to support the needed functions of their body. Hydration is vital for your health, there is a reason 50-65% of your body is made of water. Water is used to transport nutrients, minerals, amino acids, and other extremely important items around your body. If you do not keep hydrated you are much more prone to becoming sick, catching a disease, and it has even been reported that women will experience mood swings due to dehydration. It is key to be able to keep track of how much water you are taking in daily.</p>

And it was one of the hardest, most incredible adventures I've ever been on with the Lord. But during the last year, the Lord has taught me so many things. </p>
<p>One of the biggest takeaways for me on the Race, outside of having my identity as a daughter of the King firmly rooted and established in my heart, was that I have a voice that is both powerful and carries authority. And it is coupled with a deep conviction to live out Proverbs 31:8-9: “Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. Open your mouth and judge righteously. Defend the rights of the poor and needy.” </p>
<p>Over the last year, the Lord has been calling me out of hiding and calling me out of silence. And I believe that He is calling me to use my voice to fight against oppression and injustice. To open my mouth and speak up for those whose voices have been stripped away. For those who have lost the will to fight for themselves. That is the Lord’s call on my life and I believe that He is calling me to Beauty from Ashes Ministries to begin living that out.<br/> <br/>Before this year, I’d never really had a heart for women. In fact, after spending four years attending a women’s college, I was quite sick of hearing people talk about women’s right and fighting against women’s oppression. But during this past year, the Lord began to break my heart for women, specifically those trapped in the sex industry and the sex trade. </p>
<p>While in the Philippines, I got the opportunity and distinct privilege of working with a ministry called Wipe Every Tear. While there, I lived with women who had been bought, sold, and forced into the sex trade. Women who had been betrayed by the very people who were supposed to love, care for, and protect them. I met girls on the street who looked like they had barely hit puberty. 12 and 13-year olds who climbed into cars with grown men who took them to God knows where for the night. </p>
<p>And my heart broke. And it still breaks. Because they are worth SO. MUCH. MORE. They were created for more. They were designed for more. They were made for freedom. Radical, life-altering, liberating freedom. The kind of freedom that sets others free. And more than anything, I desire for their hearts to be set free. </p>
<p>That is my desire for my own heart as well and what I hope to acquire by interning at BFA. My desire is to spend another year being discipled and working in an environment where the truth about my worth and my value will continue to be ingrained in my own heart and where I will be pushed to deeper levels of freedom in Christ. </p>
<p>In doing so, my prayer is that the Lord would use me, my story, and my voice to pour into the lives of the women I get to meet over the next year and that they would encounter the God of the universe who desperately longs to fulfill the promises of Isaiah 61 in their lives.</p>
<p>If you would like to be a part of this journey and join in on the fight to rescue women from the sex trade, please check out My Campaign and pray about what God would have your role to be. </p>

I am one person with a passion to help others who do not have the knowledge or the resources. <br/><br/><b>I am looking for others to stand with me. </b><br/><br/>First we confirm whether mold is making the person sick. We do a mold test on their home. The next step is to get out of the home that is making them sick.  They cannot bring anything with them.  <br/><br/>This is what I have asked you to imagine. It’s not something easily done.  <br/><br/><b><u><font color=""#004000"">Where do they go?</font></u> </b><br/><br/>Many stay in the home that is causing their health challenges. <br/><br/>This is what I am on a mission to change.  <br/><br/>No doctor in the world can help a person get well if they continue to live in a home that is poisoning them. <br/><br/>Most people I help have been sick a long time.  <br/>They are so sick by the time I find them that they cannot work.  <br/>They cannot function in society as most people do.  <br/>Most days they cannot make it out of bed.  <br/>Many have trouble making a meal, showering and doing simple everyday tasks. <br/>The longer they stay in their home, the sicker they get.  <br/>Some die. God Bless! <br/>Some get out and they find they cannot recover.  <br/>They are already too sick from the toxins.  <br/>They are in constant pain, have vertigo, light sensitivity, migraines, insomnia, fatigue, neuropathy, seizures, nausea, confusion, dyslexia, and some have been diagnosed with cancer, pancreatitis, heart disease, strokes, MS….so many diagnoses I cannot list them all.   <br/><br/>Whether they own or rent...with no job... no income...leaving the home they do have seems insurmountable.  Living in a tent is inconceivable for someone who is barely surviving day to day.  <br/><br/><br/><b><u><font color=""#004000"">THE SOLUTION </font></u></b><br/><br/>Establish a safe house where people affected by toxic mold have a place to go to, to get well.  <br/><br/><b>A Home for Healing</b><br/><br/>My long term goal is to raise millions – creating safe houses for healing across this country. <br/><br/><b>Right now we need $75,000 </b><br/><br/>This will be enough to establish one mold safe home. <br/>One family would stay in the house at a time. <br/>It will include equipment needed for rehabilitation. <br/>An outer building will be set up to house the tools which assist with detox. <br/>It would need to include the necessities needed by the family to live. <br/><br/><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b><br/>We will begin with ONE safe healing home:<br/><ul>
<li>Our first home will be in upstate NY, close to the Vermont border.  The air is clean and there are a few houses available for under $50,000.  <br/>
</li>
<li>We have a house under contract, and have done an ERMI (mold test) on it.  <br/>If this test is acceptable we will move forward on this house.  If not we will find another house.  It's a buyer's market. <br/>
</li>
<li>To make it livable for someone who is chemically sensitive, we will use no VOC paints and Vermont Natural Coatings polyurethane on the woodwork.  There will be other specialty building materials and procedures ($5,000-$10,000)<br/>
</li>
<li>Pre and post testing for mold, Volatile Organic Compounds and formaldehyde ($2,000)<br/>
</li>
<li>We will have HEPA air filters in all the living spaces, a HEPA vacuum... as well as Propolis diffusers to clean the air. ($2,000)</li>
<li>We need to furnish the living area with chemical free furniture and bedding.  Buy new clothing, shoes and other necessities for 1-2 people. ($3,000-$6,000)</li>
<li>Most Importantly, we will provide a sauna for sweating the toxins out and supplements to aid in the detoxing.  ($5,000-10,000)<br/>
</li>
<li>If we EXCEED our goal... the excess will go toward future family necessities, housing expenses and additional housing.</li>
<li>I would like to be able to provide housing RENT FREE or on a sliding scale according to what an individual or family can reasonably afford or can get assistance with... the cost for future residents is dependent on donations.  </li>
<li>Right now we are NOT a non profit... donations are not tax deductible and we will pay taxes on any donations.  I would like to establish a non profit organization ($3,700) under the name ""Global Homes for Healing.  <br/>
</li>
</ul><b><br/>The Global Impact</b><br/>The goal here is to save as many lives as possible.  Environmental Illness (EI) is a silent epidemic.  People are getting poisoned in their homes and offices and they need safe places to live, detox and ultimately heal.  <br/><ul>
<li>Future projects may include tiny houses, porcelain trailers, land 
purchases, community initiatives, and more environmentally friendly 
housing. </li>
<li>I have partnered with real estate investors who are 
teaching me what they know so that we can build a network of safe havens
 across the United States, Canada and eventually around the world. </li>

This is what I am on a mission to change.  No doctor in the world can help a person get well if they continue to live in a home that is poisoning them. Most people I help have been sick a long time.  They are so sick by the time I find them that they cannot work.  They cannot function in society as most people do.  Most days they cannot make it out of bed.  Many have trouble making a meal, showering and doing simple everyday tasks. The longer they stay in their home, the sicker they get.  Some die. God Bless! Some get out and they find they cannot recover.  They are already too sick from the toxins.  They are in constant pain, have vertigo, light sensitivity, migraines, insomnia, fatigue, neuropathy, seizures, nausea, confusion, dyslexia, and some have been diagnosed with cancer, pancreatitis, heart disease, strokes, MS….so many diagnoses I cannot list them all.   Whether they own or rent...with no job... no income...leaving the home they do have seems insurmountable.  Living in a tent is inconceivable for someone who is barely surviving day to day.  THE SOLUTION Establish a safe house where people affected by toxic mold have a place to go to, to get well.  A Home for HealingMy long term goal is to raise millions – creating safe houses for healing across this country. Right now we need $75,000 This will be enough to establish one mold safe home. One family would stay in the house at a time. It will include equipment needed for rehabilitation. An outer building will be set up to house the tools which assist with detox. It would need to include the necessities needed by the family to live. What We Need & What You GetWe will begin with ONE safe healing home:
Our first home will be in upstate NY, close to the Vermont border.  The air is clean and there are a few houses available for under $50,000.  

We have a house under contract, and have done an ERMI (mold test) on it.  If this test is acceptable we will move forward on this house.  If not we will find another house.  It's a buyer's market. 

To make it livable for someone who is chemically sensitive, we will use no VOC paints and Vermont Natural Coatings polyurethane on the woodwork.  There will be other specialty building materials and procedures ($5,000-$10,000)

Pre and post testing for mold, Volatile Organic Compounds and formaldehyde ($2,000)

We will have HEPA air filters in all the living spaces, a HEPA vacuum... as well as Propolis diffusers to clean the air. ($2,000)
We need to furnish the living area with chemical free furniture and bedding.  Buy new clothing, shoes and other necessities for 1-2 people. ($3,000-$6,000)
Most Importantly, we will provide a sauna for sweating the toxins out and supplements to aid in the detoxing.  ($5,000-10,000)

If we EXCEED our goal... the excess will go toward future family necessities, housing expenses and additional housing.
I would like to be able to provide housing RENT FREE or on a sliding scale according to what an individual or family can reasonably afford or can get assistance with... the cost for future residents is dependent on donations.  
Right now we are NOT a non profit... donations are not tax deductible and we will pay taxes on any donations.  I would like to establish a non profit organization ($3,700) under the name ""Global Homes for Healing.  

The Global ImpactThe goal here is to save as many lives as possible.  Environmental Illness (EI) is a silent epidemic.  People are getting poisoned in their homes and offices and they need safe places to live, detox and ultimately heal.  
Future projects may include tiny houses, porcelain trailers, land 
purchases, community initiatives, and more environmentally friendly 
housing. 
I have partnered with real estate investors who are 
teaching me what they know so that we can build a network of safe havens
 across the United States, Canada and eventually around the world.

 was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2012 after years
of misdiagnosis. It took roughly 100 doctors, specialists, and hospital 
visits
to finally be given a correct diagnosis for her illness. I have 
personally witnessed the tragic effects of Lyme in Heather with my own 
eyes. I have seen her at her very best and her very worst. 

<p>If a patient knows that they have been bitten by a tick
and seek immediate treatment protocol in Canada will allow the doctor to treat
the patient with a course of antibiotics for a few weeks and the patient will recover.
However, not everyone bitten by a tick will have the classic “bullseye” shaped
rash that commonly accompanies a tick bite. If the patient does not know they
have been bitten the tick will then infect its host with bacteria and the end
result can be <b>catastrophic. </b></p>
<p>When Lyme reaches the chronic state it has the ability to
attack the joints, muscles, heart, brain and organs. Lyme is a great impostor, mimicking
symptoms of other up to 300 other illnesses such as cancer, lupus, MS,
fibromyalgia, arthritis, cardiac disease, brain tumor, Alzheimer’s, mono and Epstein
Barr just to name a few. Diagnosing Lyme disease is a long and terrifying road.</p>
<p>Lyme testing and treatment protocol in Canada is severely
outdated. The blood tests available often return a false negative and patients
go on to suffer without answers while their health rapidly deteriorates. Many
doctors will tell the patient that the symptoms are all in their head and
should see a psychiatrist. </p>
<p>Protocol in Canada states that doctors should either treat
as they see fit or do nothing as statements from infectious disease departments
insist that chronic Lyme doesn't exist. This is because patients suspected of
having chronic Lyme failed to recover after being treated with the basic course
of antibiotics. The failure to recover is due to the fact that the patients did
not receive the correct antibiotics, the correct dosage or the correct amount
of time to allow the antibiotics to work. Lyme also brings with it many
co-infections. If these infections are not isolated and treated the patient
will not make any improvement. The Lyme bacteria is corkscrew shaped giving it
the perfect defense, <b>it has the ability to drill into the muscles, joints and
organs and hang on for as long as it possibly can, reproducing and spreading in
the process. </b></p>

<p></p>
<p>Doctors in Canada have lost their license for treating patients with long term antibiotics for Lyme. Doctors can and will refuse to see a patient once it is discovered that they have chronic Lyme even if the patient is seeking help for something completely unrelated to Lyme. This is why many patients, Heather included, have to seek treatment from Lyme literate doctors in the USA and pay out of pocket for their treatment.</p>
<p>Heather spent 4 years in excruciating physical pain and her body began to breakdown and deteriorate. She had hundreds of doctor appointments, emergency transport by ambulance to hospitals, meetings with neurosurgeons, MRI scans, xrays, CT scans, infectious disease consultations, painful procedures and tests all resulting in no answers. Time and time again her symptoms were blamed on anxiety. </p>
<p>In 2009 Heather had a gym membership, she hiked, walked five miles a day, she spent time in nature and has produced some of the most breathtaking works of art and photography I have ever seen. Now she becomes fatigued so quickly she can’t walk more than 20 minutes at a time. She has difficulty breathing, chest pain, migraines, severe joint pain and stiffness, cognitive impairment resulting in brain fog, difficulty communicating and finding the right words to express herself. Her body swells head to toe with edema, she requires help with household chores, cooking, cleaning and getting to medical appointments. She has experienced hair loss, chronic sore throat, searing neck pain, sensitivity to light and sound, numbness and tingling in her body. She has panic attacks, dental problems, several bouts with shingles resulting in nerve damage, sleep apnea, and most recently she has started to suffer from possible partial seizures. She is awaiting a proper diagnosis for the strange out of body experiences. Heather describes it as ""being trapped between two worlds"" or feeling like she is falling out of her body. It goes without saying that this is a terrifying situation and they can strike without warning at any time.</p>

<p>Heather started making good progress with her Lyme treatment and became 50% better over time thanks to her wonderful Lyme doctor and health team in Canada. Heather was on the same antibiotics for 18 months only to suffer a serious decline in March 2014. Heather was bitten by an unknown bug causing her ankle to swell double its size and turn red with intense itching. She was taken to hospital emergency three times in the span of a week and received no help, no treatment, no diagnosis. <b>She went from  being 50% better to 10% with 80% of her Lyme symptoms returning. </b></p>
<p>Heather desperately needs your help. Her health is declining at an alarming rate. Her body no longer responds to her current course of antibiotics and she is now having to take even stronger antibiotics with incredibly alarming side effects and herxheimer reaction while the antibiotics do their job. It is possible that Heather is going to get much worse before she gets better. Heather is allergic to most antibiotics and it is currently unknown if she will have a life threatening reaction to these new drugs. Heather is unable to work due to her health and has no blood family to support her. She relies on the few close friends to help her get through when possible but we cannot do it all on our own. <b>We need your help. </b></p>
<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>As of June 2015 Heather received information
from blood tests that her liver enzymes are elevated. She began to experience
severe back pain and feeling like someone had beat in her kidneys. Alone and
afraid Heather went to the hospital. Her pain was ignored by hospital staff
even when it made it impossible for her to walk. Eventually she was given an
injection of an unknown substance, doctors would not tell her what she had been
injected with. Heather informed the hospital staff that her liver enzymes are
elevated however they refused to run any further blood tests. She was told that
she made the decision as a Canadian to seek health care in the United States
and she decided to take all these antibiotics so she can just go back to the
USA for medical care. Heather has been denied treatmet yet again in her home
country. Since this hospital visit Heather was able to have blood tests ran
elsewhere and found out that her liver enzymes have doubled since the first
test. </strong></p><p></p>

injection of an unknown substance, doctors would not tell her what she had been
injected with. Heather informed the hospital staff that her liver enzymes are
elevated however they refused to run any further blood tests. She was told that
she made the decision as a Canadian to seek health care in the United States
and she decided to take all these antibiotics so she can just go back to the
USA for medical care. Heather has been denied treatmet yet again in her home
country. Since this hospital visit Heather was able to have blood tests ran
elsewhere and found out that her liver enzymes have doubled since the first
test.

When out in nature always check yourself, your loved ones, and your pets for ticks. They are small, about the size of a poppy seed. Always wear insect repellent containing DEET when hiking, camping, spending any time out in nature where ticks can be found. Ticks are spreading rapidly across Canada and the United States. A tick check could save your life.

ILO Makes It EasierUnlike other products, ILO provides personal guidance that's NOT based on a single, fixed regimen, but on where you're at right now.ILO helps you understand ‘the why’ and ‘the where’ behind your fertility cycle and ovulation, linking your symptoms, your fertility window and your overall cycle. Every woman is different, which means that there's no ""standard"" cycle. There's even variation from cycle to cycle due to stress and other common factors.ILO uses advanced AI technology to adapt to your personal data to give you more accurate results every cycle.That's right: incredibly accurate data entirely based on what your body is saying. Even if your cycles are irregular. Backed By Science, Proven By Births   Our Method Really Is The Most AccurateHormone test stripes are only accurate at one time during the day: they can show a wrong result when performing the test outside of the morning window.Temperature and pulse measurements are incredibly affected by illness and stress.Heavily relying on past cycles to predict your fertility with temperature or mucus is just as inaccurate, as more than 60% of women have at least 6 days of variation cycle to cycle.ILO is accurate, and ILO is honest about its accuracy.Our competitors are only being partially honest with you. The numbers and data from their published clinical trials do not match the data they’re using in their marketing. They’re pulling only their best data, their best results. For example, top a brand you’ve heard of (and probably tried) claims they can predict 5-10 high fertile days before peak fertility for one third of all women. This sounds great! However, showing more than 6 days of a fertile window is too wide a window when trying to conceive, and this data doesn’t really tell you anything, as 10 days is 1/3 of a month. Additionally, to produce these numbers, this brand is only giving you data from 89 women, despite the thousands of women they claim to have run trials with.A different top brand you’ve heard of (and also probably tried) claims they have experience with thousands of cycles and that they ran a clinical trial for over one year. However, they only use 247 of those cycles and their data in advertising and communication. Another top brand tells you they offer a predication of 8 fertile days. However, scientifically, this does not make sense: the maximum sperm life is 5 days and the actual fertile day around Ovulation is 12-24 hours.  We’re not here to trick you into purchasing ILO. We’re here because we saw a way to improve the way the world is trying to conceive. We’re trying to make a difference. Our studies will be published soon. Please reach out to our team if you have questions, or you can see the science linked at the bottom of this page.   Symptom Tracking And Identification With ILO, you can choose to document your symptoms (such as breast pain and headaches) so you can track and prepare for your cycle symptoms month over month. Increase Chances Of PregnancyStudies show you’re almost 40% more likely to get pregnant when intercourse is timed to match your fertility window after tracking your cycle.ILO knows your window. Reliable Guidance At Every StepWhether you’re trying now or you’ve already conceived, the ILO app contains a massive library on reproductive health and wellness from conception to birth. Make Family Planning Stress FreeWe put extra effort into ensuring there was nothing complicated about ILO's app experience. Are you ovulating? Find out with a glance. ILO will be available for iOS and Android. Recently Featured In  A Look Inside ILO We Are Carbomed, We’re The Team Bringing You ILO Proudly Partnered With Helping You Conceive Starting In February 2019 ILO: Ready For Production About ILO ShippingWe are able to ship worldwide.

Our business provides on-site classes aimed towards recreational relaxation for all levels; our clients will include workplaces, colleges, athletic facilities, food markets, and more. The “Buddha Bus” itself is a fully equipped business vehicle that carries enough supplies to comfortably host classes up to 30 people in any location. When Buddha Bus Yoga™ arrives to your location to teach class it comes with enough mats and blocks for everyone. In addition, every class will be taught with a speaker system that adds a nice musical groove to the class atmosphere. Individuals taking the Yoga class will never be paying for the class because the class is paid for by whomever is in charge of the space that the Buddha Bus is traveling to.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480451102/xwz6dvslip3zb5uxkjqz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About our name, “Buddha Bus Yoga”</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Hi, my name is Sara Maloney and I am the founder of Buddha Bus Yoga. I have been a practicing certified Yoga instructor for 2 years running my own classes as well as working at various studios in New England. Buddha’s teachings inspire me daily in my meditation practices at home and at the Cambridge Zen Center. To me, Yoga is the synchronization of mind and body. The goal here is to have body and mind work together in balance, together strengthening each other. One way that the mind can refocus and come to the body is through mindfulness and present focus. A person thinking about their next pose, or their shopping list will have difficulty feeling the full benefits of their yoga practice. To avoid this distraction I often look to Buddha’s words and wisdom on mindfulness, living in the moment, and coming back to the breath. Though Buddha did not lead in the Yogic movement, he did provide great wisdom on concepts that are imperative to a complete yoga Practice like mindfulness, gratitude, and living in the moment.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Buddha once spoke, “Your work is to discover your world, and then, with all of your heart, give yourself to it.” Practicing Yoga and spreading its emotional and physical benefits with others is what I truly believe my “world” is. Buddha Bus Yoga™ spreads Yoga to people in unconventional places to enhance Yoga’s accessibility to all; I chose to name my mission after the man who inspired me to discover my world.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Where will Buddha Bus Yoga make Yoga accessible?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Buddha Bus Yoga’s main target is currently 9-5 workplaces, college campuses, athletic facilities, community events and schools. Buddha Bus Yoga has two main goals: build a fun, widespread community and alleviate the pain that Americans face daily like stress, disconnect, and a restless mind and body. By taking Buddha Bus Yoga™ into workplaces the employees of any office can take 30-60 minutes out of their day to step away from work, their mental to-do lists, and life’s daily demands, and reground. Anyone who becomes a part of the Buddha Bus Yoga™ community will be able to come to a mat (provided to them) and partake in a Yoga practice (free to them) and step away from the craziness of everyday life for a moment. This will not only improve the health of the individual, but also the community they are a part of. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The News is Spreading!! </strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480451216/myyotnpzp3kmnfftldnh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Other Media Coverage...</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Her Campus Profile </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.hercampus.com/school/suffolk/profile-sara-maloney"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hercampus.com/school/suffolk/profile-sara-maloney</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Suffolk Voice Article by Nicole Baker </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://suffolkvoice.net/2016/11/21/suffolk-student-launches-mobile-yoga-company/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://suffolkvoice.net/2016/11/21/suffolk-student-launches-mobile-yoga-company/</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>See every step along this journey! </strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Vlogs, Yoga photos, and life as BBY founder: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/yogi_smaloney/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/yogi_smaloney/</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why we need your support!</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Buddha Bus Yoga™ has a very simple business plan, but much more goes into it than meets the eye!

Every time the Buddha Bus stops it will roll out the mats, blocks, and speakers necessary to hold the perfect class. All of this plus the instructor of course! The idea is to continually provide a hands-free, stress-free, Yoga experience to all. Right now Buddha Bus Yoga needs the capital to buy mats, blocks, and a speaker system. As well as mat cleaner, company insurance, a leer camper shell, the Limited Liability Company registration fee, and the Graphic design work already utilized.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480451127/t0zjty3nn4skqlafy8zk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Is Yoga growing in the market place?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Oh yes, it is. Buddha Bus Yoga’s initial target market place is New England, but especially Boston, Massachusetts. This year Boston was selected as “The Most Active City in the US” by Blue Zones LLC, a community transformation program which monitors large metropolitan areas across the country and reports data on fitness, healthcare, wellness and accessibility. According to Blue Zones, a health conscious community provides easy access to healthy foods, gyms, fitness studios and other wellness programs. Boston fitness and extra curricular activities were measured in 2015 using a numerical ranking system, and out of the top ten Yoga ranked seventh.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Out of the total population, 37% of Boston is between the ages of 20-34, which is the demographic reported to be the most active age group in the United States. Of this group, 73% takes advantage of exercise programs offered in the community. This equates to more than 239,000 residents. With Boston leading nationally in health and activity, the future looks promising.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>I am “not good at Yoga” will I embarrass myself?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">This question should be listed under VVFAQ , “very very frequently asked questions”, but there is no such thing as being ""not good at yoga""! In my opinion, a person who has only just stepped on a Yoga mat is good at yoga. Why? Because they have chosen to be there. Being open to try, to challenge your comfort zone, and to be present are all elements that build the foundation of the Yoga practice. If you have stepped on a mat, you are already half way there!</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">I see the physical components of Yoga breaking down into three distinct categories: balance, flexibility, and strength. Everybody is stronger in one of these categories than the other, and by harnessing the category you are stronger in you can grow in the other two, when this happens your whole yoga practice grows. So the answer is no! You can't possibly embarrass yourself. You simply need to come to the mat with an open mind.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>I’ve never done Yoga before.</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Can beginners take class with Buddha Bus Yoga™?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Yes! The way all Buddha Bus Yoga classes are taught is from the most basic level with variations that allow for the more experienced practitioners to pursue challenge if they so choose. Buddha Bus Yoga classes teach from the foundational poses because our practice is not focused on calorie burning, twisting yourself into a pretzel, or standing on your head. Our classes are about taking the individual out of there busy bustling schedules and relax a bit by connecting with their bodies and minds, and of course, have a little fun while doing it.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">If you still aren’t convinced, let the numbers speak for themselves! Reports released from Yoga Alliance this year found that 34% of the United States population is likely to try Yoga for the first time this year. This is great news for Buddha Bus Yoga because our main clientele is beginners, and beginner’s make-up 98% of current practitioners in the country. Overall, there has been a 20% increase in people practicing Yoga in Boston for the past 4 years. If you are anew to Yoga, you are in the majority!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What kind of bus is it?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The ""bus"" is not actually a bus in this stage of Buddha Bus Yoga, the beginning of Buddha Bus Yoga will be bootstrapped in every element so that we can get off the ground and get Yoga into the places where it really matters! In order for this to happen we will be using an already owned F1 50 truck and put a Leer camper shell on the back to convert it into a storage company vehicle! After building up some profit Buddha Bus Yoga plans to invest in a more brand-oriented vehicle, something similar to a bus  but with a bit more groove. With funky colors and a great exterior, the Buddha Bus will become a well-known vehicle in the New England area, note, this is in fact a long-term goal and will not be a part of the items purchased after being funded.

Our business provides on-site classes aimed towards recreational relaxation for all levels; our clients will include workplaces, colleges, athletic facilities, food markets, and more. The “Buddha Bus” itself is a fully equipped business vehicle that carries enough supplies to comfortably host classes up to 30 people in any location. When Buddha Bus Yoga™ arrives to your location to teach class it comes with enough mats and blocks for everyone. In addition, every class will be taught with a speaker system that adds a nice musical groove to the class atmosphere. Individuals taking the Yoga class will never be paying for the class because the class is paid for by whomever is in charge of the space that the Buddha Bus is traveling to.About our name, “Buddha Bus Yoga”Hi, my name is Sara Maloney and I am the founder of Buddha Bus Yoga. I have been a practicing certified Yoga instructor for 2 years running my own classes as well as working at various studios in New England. Buddha’s teachings inspire me daily in my meditation practices at home and at the Cambridge Zen Center. To me, Yoga is the synchronization of mind and body. The goal here is to have body and mind work together in balance, together strengthening each other. One way that the mind can refocus and come to the body is through mindfulness and present focus. A person thinking about their next pose, or their shopping list will have difficulty feeling the full benefits of their yoga practice. To avoid this distraction I often look to Buddha’s words and wisdom on mindfulness, living in the moment, and coming back to the breath. Though Buddha did not lead in the Yogic movement, he did provide great wisdom on concepts that are imperative to a complete yoga Practice like mindfulness, gratitude, and living in the moment.Buddha once spoke, “Your work is to discover your world, and then, with all of your heart, give yourself to it.” Practicing Yoga and spreading its emotional and physical benefits with others is what I truly believe my “world” is. Buddha Bus Yoga™ spreads Yoga to people in unconventional places to enhance Yoga’s accessibility to all; I chose to name my mission after the man who inspired me to discover my world.  Where will Buddha Bus Yoga make Yoga accessible?Buddha Bus Yoga’s main target is currently 9-5 workplaces, college campuses, athletic facilities, community events and schools. Buddha Bus Yoga has two main goals: build a fun, widespread community and alleviate the pain that Americans face daily like stress, disconnect, and a restless mind and body. By taking Buddha Bus Yoga™ into workplaces the employees of any office can take 30-60 minutes out of their day to step away from work, their mental to-do lists, and life’s daily demands, and reground. Anyone who becomes a part of the Buddha Bus Yoga™ community will be able to come to a mat (provided to them) and partake in a Yoga practice (free to them) and step away from the craziness of everyday life for a moment. This will not only improve the health of the individual, but also the community they are a part of. The News is Spreading!! Other Media Coverage...Her Campus Profile http://www.hercampus.com/school/suffolk/profile-sara-maloneySuffolk Voice Article by Nicole Baker http://suffolkvoice.net/2016/11/21/suffolk-student-launches-mobile-yoga-company/See every step along this journey! Vlogs, Yoga photos, and life as BBY founder: https://www.instagram.com/yogi_smaloney/Why we need your support!Buddha Bus Yoga™ has a very simple business plan, but much more goes into it than meets the eye! One of the most exciting elements of Buddha Bus Yoga™ is the all-inclusivity it brings to every class. Every time the Buddha Bus stops it will roll out the mats, blocks, and speakers necessary to hold the perfect class. All of this plus the instructor of course! The idea is to continually provide a hands-free, stress-free, Yoga experience to all. Right now Buddha Bus Yoga needs the capital to buy mats, blocks, and a speaker system. As well as mat cleaner, company insurance, a leer camper shell, the Limited Liability Company registration fee, and the Graphic design work already utilized. FAQsIs Yoga growing in the market place?Oh yes, it is. Buddha Bus Yoga’s initial target market place is New England, but especially Boston, Massachusetts. This year Boston was selected as “The Most Active City in the US” by Blue Zones LLC, a community transformation program which monitors large metropolitan areas across the country and reports data on fitness, healthcare, wellness and accessibility. According to Blue Zones, a health conscious community provides easy access to healthy foods, gyms, fitness studios and other wellness programs. Boston fitness and extra curricular activities were measured in 2015 using a numerical ranking system, and out of the top ten Yoga ranked seventh.Out of the total population, 37% of Boston is between the ages of 20-34, which is the demographic reported to be the most active age group in the United States. Of this group, 73% takes advantage of exercise programs offered in the community. This equates to more than 239,000 residents. With Boston leading nationally in health and activity, the future looks promising. I am “not good at Yoga” will I embarrass myself?This question should be listed under VVFAQ , “very very frequently asked questions”, but there is no such thing as being ""not good at yoga""! In my opinion, a person who has only just stepped on a Yoga mat is good at yoga. Why? Because they have chosen to be there. Being open to try, to challenge your comfort zone, and to be present are all elements that build the foundation of the Yoga practice. If you have stepped on a mat, you are already half way there!I see the physical components of Yoga breaking down into three distinct categories: balance, flexibility, and strength. Everybody is stronger in one of these categories than the other, and by harnessing the category you are stronger in you can grow in the other two, when this happens your whole yoga practice grows. So the answer is no! You can't possibly embarrass yourself. You simply need to come to the mat with an open mind. I’ve never done Yoga before.Can beginners take class with Buddha Bus Yoga™?Yes! The way all Buddha Bus Yoga classes are taught is from the most basic level with variations that allow for the more experienced practitioners to pursue challenge if they so choose. Buddha Bus Yoga classes teach from the foundational poses because our practice is not focused on calorie burning, twisting yourself into a pretzel, or standing on your head. Our classes are about taking the individual out of there busy bustling schedules and relax a bit by connecting with their bodies and minds, and of course, have a little fun while doing it.If you still aren’t convinced, let the numbers speak for themselves! Reports released from Yoga Alliance this year found that 34% of the United States population is likely to try Yoga for the first time this year. This is great news for Buddha Bus Yoga because our main clientele is beginners, and beginner’s make-up 98% of current practitioners in the country. Overall, there has been a 20% increase in people practicing Yoga in Boston for the past 4 years. If you are anew to Yoga, you are in the majority! What kind of bus is it?The ""bus"" is not actually a bus in this stage of Buddha Bus Yoga, the beginning of Buddha Bus Yoga will be bootstrapped in every element so that we can get off the ground and get Yoga into the places where it really matters! In order for this to happen we will be using an already owned F1 50 truck and put a Leer camper shell on the back to convert it into a storage company vehicle! After building up some profit Buddha Bus Yoga plans to invest in a more brand-oriented vehicle, something similar to a bus  but with a bit more groove. With funky colors and a great exterior, the Buddha Bus will become a well-known vehicle in the New England area, note, this is in fact a long-term goal and will not be a part of the items purchased after being funded. For now, the main focus is not so much the aesthetic of our brand as much as getting out and getting individuals on their mats!So if there is no actual “bus” why Buddha Bus Yoga?The “bus” is a concept. Bare with me here, the idea of a ""bus"" represents community and mobility, which are two main pillars of what Buddha Bus Yoga is. It is important to note that the long-term goal is indeed to buy a bus like vehicle, but for now, a decked out F150 will do! If I am taking class how much do I pay?Nothing! The root of Buddha Bus Yoga is to make it accessible to anyone! When an individual is taking a class they are not paying, instead, BBY’s class transactions go on with the people who are in charge of the organizations that are being visited. For example, when visiting a company the employees will not pay for a class, but human resources who are given a budget for events in the workplace will be. The same goes for any school or outdoor community event where Buddha Bus Yoga visits. How do you see this venture scaling?Bringing Yoga to places that will enhance the health of both the individual and the community they are a part of is something that BBY hopes to do beyond Boston and New England spaces.

  My name is Walter Olkewicz and I've had the good fortune to be
an actor for the past 40 years. I've done some 50 movies and over a 100 TV
shows. That ended about 15 years ago with my first knee surgery. Infections
cropped up over and over again to the tune of, to date, 19 surgeries and my
living in a wheel chair the past ten years. Recently I was introduced to a doctor
from Mexico who'd had great results with the treatment of infections. The shots
I was given have been working and according to my surgeon the infections have been subsiding. The prayers of friends and family were finally answered. </p>
<p>   The only problem is the injections and the care I've needed to continue- none of this is covered by insurance. I've depleted all of my savings and I simply can not afford to continue without help. Before this treatment started my doctor     spoke of the very real possibility of having my leg amputated. Needless to say, this scared the bejesus out of me. After so many surgeries and this most           welcome recent success, I simply can not even imagine not continuing. </p>
<p>Please Help!</p>
<p>  **** I'd like at this point to thank all who have helped. As most of you know this is the 2nd half of a campaign that started a couple of months ago. Although I only reached a bit less than 40% of my goal (explaining the need for this campaign), I have begun the treatments and have increased their frequency 200%!! The results are miraculous! Talk of amputation is at this point off the table. Though still a possibility it has gone from a 50/50 chance to less than a 5% chance. I can breathe easier. But now I need to <u>complete</u> the program which will reach into about a 6 month total. The shots both eradicate the infection AND (the more important part right now) build the cells and revive a leg that hasn't been used much in the past 12-15 years. Two months ago it was like trying to walk on a wet noodle. As my leg builds strength (currently at bread stick status), it will eventually- with a shipload of hard work- return to most of the strength I had in the leg 20 years ago.  Part of my ""Goal"" calculations include work with a physical trainer. Luckily some of that IS covered by insurance. Insurance covers 8 times per 3-month period, I need work with a trainer 5+ times a week.Not an easy path, but one I can dedicate myself to. Thanks to all of you.</p>
<p>  Over the first 30 years of my blessed career I was known for helping people    (In the ten years that I ran my theater- The Jewel Box-  over half of my students were there on ""Scholarships"" because they simply could not afford to come to class otherwise). I have coached fellow actors, people on the set, pretty much  anybody I was lucky enough to work with for free, just trying to give back some of the good fortune I'd been lucky enough to receive. </p>
<p>Now I find it time to ask for help. </p>
<p>The estimated cost of these injections, the travel involved with obtaining them, and the personal care I need in the time until I am walking and ""on my feet"" 
again is about fifty thousand dollars (that figure might seem high until you         consider that the hospital and doctor bills that <i>were</i> covered by insurance is      nearly half a million)</p>
<p>True ""Hope"" is finally in my heart again. And being the creative animal
that I am thoughts for a new theater keep me awake at night. I <i>will</i>  make it
happen! You can't imagine how frustrating something like persistent knee
infections can be in blocking this dream. It would be like Picasso not being
able to paint because he is in court fighting overdue traffic tickets. Okay,
it's not exactly the same but you get the idea. </p>
<p>Over the past few years I have had lots of hospital time to read and study the 
great spiritual thinkers. I've come to understand that my ideas for an uplifting, 
inspiring theater are a direct result of me connecting with my Divine Purpose.    I don't want that to sound egotistical or ""highfalutin"", you see <i>each of us</i>
has a Divine Purpose. I've just been lucky enough to finally understand mine.
 </p>
<p>So anyone generous enough to contribute, I will gladly include you in our              opening audience at ""Up On Stage"", my new theater. </p>
<p>Sooo....</p>
<p>Anybody who <i>contributes $25  </i>gets an autographed picture of me from              whatever work of mine they most like (or a copy of my knee X-rays if you are   goofy enough for <i>that </i> to be more appealing to you).  I apologize for the levity,  but I learned a while ago that if I can't laugh at all this I am in real trouble. </p>
<p>For $50 dollars you will get four tickets to my first weeks opening  -  copies of my knee X-rays will be distributed at the door. </p>
<p><i>And</i> for a $100 dollars or more you will get an autograph picture, four tickets to opening week, and my son will come over and mow your lawn.  Okay he is probably too busy to do that. If you call me I'll give you my advice on how to make your lawn greener by using paper machete mulch. </p>
<p>Thank you very much for even reading this request. Please understand that 
despite any frivolity this is a most serious situation. My life and future career 
depend on it. </p>
<p>Financial times being what they are, if you can't contribute yourself, I hope you will be willing to spread the word of my situation to your personal contacts. I 
believe we are all here on this planet to help each other. I hope you agree. And I hope you will consider my plight worthy of your generosity. If not my prayers 
are with you for wherever your generosity might flow. </p>

<h3>We've reached the ""tipping point"" - leading edge approaches to mind-body wellness and more ...</h3>
<p>   More than a decade ago, Leigh Spusta set out to create the most effective and enjoyable therapeutic soundscapes available - international attention and preliminary brainwave analysis now shows that this goal is being realized. Leigh's PsimatiX<em>™</em> recordings utilize a tried and true formula of brainwave entrainment technologies and  musical hypnotic modalities designed to bring the listener into ideal states of awareness and deep relaxation. In short, tuning the brain and the body towards wellness and maximizing human potential. Perhaps the most exciting venture we are exploring is the PsimatiX<em>™ </em>""Sonic-Spa"" - allowing you to be fully immersed in rich, vibrational sound from head to toe... described in detail below.</p>
<p>   Here is just a brief mention of what we are finding through preliminary studies of brainwave activity of listeners - <em>both hemispheres moving into full synchronization and moving into alpha and theta states quickly, even delta states after 15 minutes! Relaxation response is very high and attention is maintained (not simply falling asleep). It has been observed that the PsimatiX<em>™</em> audio also mimicks deep hypnotic behavior in subjects. </em>So far, PsimatiX is out-performing other audio programs being tested.</p>
<p>Some of the noteworthy benefits of listening to brainwave audio :</p>
<p><em>Deep Relaxation</em></p>
<p><em>Reduction of stress, both physical and mental</em></p>
<p><em>Easy access to trance and meditative states</em></p>
<p><em>Emotional release</em></p>
<p><em>Sleep enhancement</em></p>
<p><em>Anxiety reduction</em></p>
<p><em>Ability to target specific brainwave states of Alpha, Theta, Delta, etc.</em></p>
<p><em>Trigger the release of endorphines, beta-endorphines, melatonin, seratonin, catecholamines, dopamine, HGH, DHEA</em></p>
<p><em>Reduction of heart rate and blood pressure</em></p>
<p><em>Increased cellular calcium and oxygen</em></p>
<p><em>Enhanced creativity</em></p>
<p><em>Improved memory, focus, concentration</em></p>
<p><em>Motivation</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><br/></em><strong>Current Titles in the PsimatiX Library :</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong><em><strong>Hypnotic Brainwave SoundScapes -</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Distant Images</em></p>
<p><em>Mystic Ascension</em></p>
<p><em>Opus Magnum</em></p>
<p><em>Elemental Currents</em></p>
<p><em>Chakra Attunement Series</em></p>
<p><em>Deep Delta Program</em></p>
<p><em>Sonic Keys of Pythagoras</em></p>

<p><em>The DreamScape - Portal into Creative Dreaming</em></p>
<p><em>Merlin's Gift Imagery Program</em></p>
<p><em>Incredibly Good Luck Hypnosis</em></p>
<p><em>Past Life Regression Hypnosis</em></p>
<p><em>Opening the Third Eye - Psychic Intuition Program</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Our campaign has 2 phases :</strong></p>
<p>   1. We have begun development on some new and exciting products, just a couple of which are :</p>
<p>   <strong>The DreamTime Series</strong> - Using comprehensive brainwave audio, storytelling, and unique hypnosis strategies, these engaging programs will assist the listener to become more and more proficient at lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming offers a whole new world of excitement, growth, and experience. </p>
<p>   <strong>The Ultra Brainwave Bundle</strong> - This package will include many hours of rich, blissful soundscapes that target specific brainwave states / mind-sets such as High and Low Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta, and ""Hyper-Focus"", ""Healing Zone"", and ""Higher Consciousness"". Tap into your mind's power to best meet the needs of the day, sonic tools for empowerment.</p>
<p>To realize our first phase, we plan to invest in some new synthesizer equipment, audio software, and brainwave eeg analysis hardware (NeuroSky) and software. This will allow us a greater palette to compose cutting edge material, and also enable us to perform ongoing clinical studies of brainwave patterns and experiential reports of both existing and newer material.</p>
<p>   2. Development of the new <strong>PsimatiX<em>™</em> ""Sonic-Spa""</strong> :</p>
<p>   Sound-beds are a great way to experience a deeper level of PsimatiX<em>™</em> audio, but they are often costly, bulky, or not quite good enough. The ""Sonic-Spa"" is a portable, lightweight, and affordable answer to people that would like to experience the full benefit of Leigh's PsimatiX<em>™</em> audio programs. All of these programs contain <em><strong>vibro-acoustic</strong></em> tones which are felt by the body as a deeply soothing sonic massage. By lying comfortably on the Sonic-Spa, the listener will experience both the lush stereo sounds, and the blissful vibrational massage of the recording. As mentioned, studies are showing that PsimatiX<em>™</em> audio, listened to with headphones or speakers, is out-performing other entrainment products. This is a <em>full-immersion</em> experience that is several times more powerful and effective than standard stereo or headphone listening alone. Imagine, your whole mind and body bathed in lush, therapeutic soundscapes, a musical massage. You can get a sense of what this is like by listening to one of our programs in the car (not while driving!) as the vibrations move through the seat - this is just a small taste of what the Sonic-Spa will be like. * (Provided we meet our goal, those who choose the Sonic-Spa perk will be contacted regarding the estimated delivery date.)</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://psimatix.com/Sonic-Spa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This design is meant to be simple and straight-forward, light-weight, easy to set up and break down, and easily transported. All three sections and the top cushion and pillow are covered in soft black velour. Set up will be quick - simply push the three sections together (velcro into place), connect the cables, unroll the top cushion, velcro the side speakers into place, place the pillow, and finally make sure the power supplies are plugged in and that your audio source is connected. (The Sonic-Spa can also connect to your 100 watt home theater stereo amplifier.) This will only take a few minutes and you're ready to sink into blissful comfort.</p>
<p>In addition to being the perfect complement to PsimatiX audio programs, the Sonic-Spa will also maximize the effectiveness of any relaxation / enhancement audio you choose to listen to, music, hypnosis, accelerated learning programs, etc. - imagine Maurice Ravel's ""Bolero"", or the sound of ocean waves, being infused into every cell of your body, an extremely immersive and enjoyable experience!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your help we can move into the next chapter of PsimatiX<em>™</em>, offering our best audio programs and products yet to date. The science is here now, we are well past the binaural beat technology of the 1960's (most of the brainwave products out there are still using this!) and we want to bring these highly effective products to as many people as we can, and we plan to keep pushing the envelope, you can be a part of the mind-body technology revolution!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Here is the breakdown :</h3>
<p>Whatever funding we raise will go to assure that we accomplish phase 1. If we do manage to reach or exceed our goal of $12,000 we will be in the prime position to reach phase 2 - Create the Sonic-Spa prototype, iron out the kinks, establish manufacturing connections, and scale down the retail cost. We anticipate the retail cost being in the neighborhood of $350, not bad for a portable high performance vibro-acoustic bed. </p>
<p>We will also set aside a portion of funds so that we can donate 1000 PsimatiX<em>™</em> cds of selected relaxing, therapeutic music to cancer support and treatment centers in the Los Angeles area. We have been getting some great feedback about these audio tools in healing applications including cancer.</p>
<p>The rewards we are offering you are meant to inspire and motivate you to be involved in our journey, when you think of all the people who will benefit by these products, you'll know that you are helping to change the world! </p>

<h3>Where We Are</h3>
So far we have done research on 60+ sites in our search for the right location, and the list has been narrowed to four possible sites in Costa Rica. We have done priliminary negotiations with owners of the finalist sites to verify their interest and all four owners are committed to participating in the project..</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are now seeking $40,000.00 to fund the next phase of the project which includes:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Costs of establishing a non-profit organization to manage the project</li>
<li>Travel costs to return to Costa Rica with a select group of six people, including our architect, our land planner and two world-reknowned healers to choose the final site.</li>
<li>Complete final negotiations with owner of the selected site</li>
<li>Complete initial architectual and design documents for sanctuary buildings, obtain clearances and set construction schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p> The world in which we live is a difficult and exhausting place.  Healers and those who walk the way of peace in our world are a precious and very special resource that must be cherished and supported so that they can continue to do the work that they do.</p>
<p>We believe that once the Sanctuary and the Healing Center are up and running it will be able to operate on a self-sustaining basis, providing benefit to healers and those in need alike.  Please join us in our mission.</p>

Travel costs to return to Costa Rica with a select group of six people, including our architect, our land planner and two world-reknowned healers to choose the final site.
Complete final negotiations with owner of the selected site
Complete initial architectual and design documents for sanctuary buildings, obtain clearances and set construction schedule.

 The world in which we live is a difficult and exhausting place.  Healers and those who walk the way of peace in our world are a precious and very special resource that must be cherished and supported so that they can continue to do the work that they do.
We believe that once the Sanctuary and the Healing Center are up and running it will be able to operate on a self-sustaining basis, providing benefit to healers and those in need alike.  Please join us in our mission.
We invite you to visit our website at www.ombya.com  And we ask you to  help turn this vision into a reality.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><p><b>Let's clear the air!</b> Indoor air is teeming with bacteria,
 viruses, and mold spores, which can be hazardous to your health. Bugs 
are nasty and getting nastier - some are antibiotic resistant, others 
cause allergies, still others have traveled great distances from the 
poultry factories of the Far East to get to your apartment. The world is
 getting more crowded, more urbanized, and more traveled. Perfect 
conditions for the spread of microbial mayhem. </p><h3>What is the AERO ONE?</h3><p>Designed by a physician (me), The AERO ONE is <b>much more than an air purifier</b>.
 It is an air disinfector, designed to kill and remove living 
microorganisms for the air as efficiently as possible. Unlike standard 
physical air filtration systems, it uses a unique solid reactor system 
which combines ultraviolet light with a solid matrix of UV-transmissible
 lenses. This matrix creates turbulence in the airflow which slows down 
microorganisms in the airstream, increasing the effective ultraviolet 
exposure and maximizes their elimination. This system, termed <b>3D-UV</b>,
 has been independently tested by the prestigious Research Triangle 
Institute has been proven to eliminate 100% of viruses, 99.97% of 
bacteria and 99.91% of spores within a high-flow airstream. 
In addition to the proprietary reactor system, the unit also includes a 
pleated dust filter, filter, odor-controlling carbon filter, and a true 
HEPA 99.97 postfilter. The prefilter is important for keeping dust 
contamination The HEPA filter is critical in capturing the dead bodies 
of microorganisms killed by the reactor. These particles, even though 
dead and no longer directly  infectious, can still contribute to 
allergies. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/416096/files/20140306143640-Abx1.jpg?1394145400"" src="""" style=""width: 424.006px; height: 580px;""/></p><p><i>The AERO ONE is 25in. tall, 15in. deep, and 12.5in. wide.</i></p><p>The
 3D-UV technology was invented by our company founder, a physician who 
was concerned about high air pathogen levels in hospitals.  Our first 
product was developed for air disinfection in operating rooms and other 
critical care areas. Our commercial-grade unit, the Tower One, has been 
shown to greatly reduce culturable airborne bacterial levels in hospital
 settings.  This unit is 200 pounds of stainless steel with heavy duty 
components, medical grade materials, and very high air flow rates. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/416098/files/20140306143706-Abx2.jpg?1394145426"" src="""" style=""width: 488.783px; height: 290px;""/></p><p><i>AERO ONE’S big brother:  An Aerobiotix T1 in a surgical supply roo</i>m.</p><p>Ever
 since we first developed our commercial units, we have had requests for
 a smaller, less expensive product for residential and light commercial 
use. Air pathogen levels are a great concern in homes and offices as 
well. That’s how the AERO ONE project was born. This was not an easy 
task, but with a lot of engineering we were able to put the system on a 
diet:  A more compact motor, smaller reactor and everything jammed into a
 home-friendly cabinet.  We used less expensive materials, without 
compromising the quality of the system. We changed the reactor material 
from silicate quartz (far too fragile and expensive for a residential 
unit)  to a type of plastic called fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) 
which has nearly the same UV transmissibility as quartz, at a much lower
 cost. We lowered the flow rate to levels more appropriate to 
residential use and on par with currently available high-end residential
 air purifiers. Importantly, it still remains assembled in the USA, 
specifically Ohio and Kentucky. </p><p>The proprietary reactor system in
 the AERO ONE is based upon an improvement in established ultraviolet 
disinfection technology. C-band ultraviolet wavelengths (UVC) have been 
shown to disrupt the DNA of microorganisms, leading to their 
inactivation. The use of ultraviolet sources to inactivate 
microorganisms goes back several decades, but there have been 
significant limitations to the technology, particularly in the field of 
air disinfection.  Unlike surface disinfection, air disinfection 
requires you to hit a moving target. Since the rate of inactivation is 
based upon the duration of UV exposure, faster air velocities 
exponentially reduce the effectiveness of UV disinfection.. One way to 
combat this effect is to increase the UV wattage, but this has side 
effects including high power consumption, expense, and the formation of 
dangerous ozone from oxygen molecules in the air.  In order to maintain 
high kill rates with a modest UVC power a new system needed to be 
developed. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/416101/files/20140306143746-Abx3.jpg?1394145466"" src="""" style=""width: 417.707px; height: 356px;""/></p><p><i>The problem:  As air volume increases, the amount of UV power 
required for microorganism inactivation increases exponentially to 
unsustainable levels.</i></p><p>We discovered that running the air 
through a maze of randomly oriented lenses made from UVC-transmissible 
material while simultaneously bombarding the airstream with UVC achieved
 very high kill rates at modest power levels.  The maze, which we term 
the reactor, facilitates microorganism inactivation in several ways:</p><p>
•	It creates turbulence in the airstream, reducing the net velocity of microorganisms.</p><p>
•	It transiently captures microorganisms in dead ends within the matrix, increasing exposure time </p><p>•	It creates an increased surface area for  inactivation to occur </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/416102/files/20140306143838-Abx4.jpg?1394145518"" src="""" style=""width: 437.525px; height: 503px;""/></p><p><i>The 3D-UV reactor (commercial size) illuminated by UVC sources.
</i>  </p><h3>WHY BUY ONE?</h3><p>Don’t let its subdued looks fool you, 
the AERO ONE is a killer, from which virtually no microorganism emerges 
alive. The dizzying array of “air purifiers” on the market all generally
 have the same physical principle of operation:  Preventing big things 
from going through slightly smaller holes.  They don’t know or care 
whether that particle is living or dead. They offer a physical solution,
 not a biological solution. 
The AERO ONE offers a biological solution to a biological problem of 
airborne pathogens. </p><p>Here are a few exceptional features of the AERO ONE:</p><p>•	Compact footprint </p><p>•	Low noise – 50 dB </p><p>
•	All steel construction, including stainless steel front </p><p>•	Decision-free single speed* </p><p>•	Quiet and vibration-free brushless AC motor </p><p>•	Conforms to UL and CSA standards for safety </p><p>•	Assembled in the USA of top quality materials </p><p>•	HEPA postfilter 99.97% efficiency</p><p>
•	Two stage prefilter, including odor-absorbing activated carbon layer
•	Good for 200SFroom. </p><p>
•	Ball-bearing casters. </p><p>•	Two 16W Philips ultraviolet sources </p><p>•	No ozone generation </p><p>•	Lamp integrity LED indicator </p><p>•	115 volt AC, 60 hertz, 5 ampere operation </p><p>*
 The AERO ONE has only one fan speed. The 3D-UV reactor in this 
application is designed to achieve maximal efficiency at a specific 200 
CFM air flow rate. Lower speeds won’t generate enough turbulence in the 
reactor to get the desired kill rate; higher speeds will reduce the 
exposure time needed to achieve the desired kill rate. Therefore there 
is one and only one speed. Please don’t ask for multiple speeds, life is
 full of sacrifices and sometimes compromises must be made in the 
pursuit of excellence. </p><p>In fact, we regard with suspicion any air 
purification system which has a wide array of speeds. The air flow rate 
is critical to the efficiency of most filtration systems, particularly 
HEPA systems. Low speeds are quiet, but perform negligible filtration; 
high speeds can easily overload small HEPA filters.  
 </p><h3>
HOW IT WORKS:</h3><p>The AERO ONE combines four modes of air treatment, 
in a compact, portable recirculating unit. The four modes of air 
treatment are:</p><p>1. Activated carbon prefiltration. An activated 
carbon prefilter stage serves to remove odors in the airstream , 
including those commonly originating from pets, smoke,  cooking and 
other sources. The carbon in embedded in a course foam which also serves
 to capture  large dust particles and gross contaminants.</p><p>2. 
Medium efficiency pleated prefilter.  This 10 in x 10 in. prefilter has a
 medium grade efficiency, similar to a furnace-type filter, only
 smaller. This serves to capture small dust and dirt particles. This 
prefilter element serves the important duty of preventing gross 
particles from getting into the unit itself and contaminating the motor,
 reactor and internal components.</p><p>3. The 3D-UV reactor. This unit 
consists of a rectangular steel  box filled with several hundred 
cylinders of UV-transmissible polymer.  The reactor is perforated on the bottom to 
allow the air flow to pass though the cylinders. The cylinders are 
illuminated by dual UV-lamps which are mounted to the top of the 
reactor. The lamps are shielded by metal hoods, and the cylinders are 
contained by a fine mesh to prevent them from blowing out of the reactor
 box.  Any microorganisms or bioaerosols in the airstream are 
decelerated, enturbulated, and temporarily captured within the matrix 
while simultaneously being irradiated with UV-C light.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/416105/files/20140306143941-Abx5.jpg?1394145581"" src="""" style=""""/></p>4. HEPA filter. This is a large 12 in. x 12 in. x 6in. true HEPA filter

<p>Hello, we are Jake and Megan Guillen from Las Vegas, Nevada.  We have been together for five years, married for two and a half, and have shared a longtime desire to become parents - a desire that continues to grow more and more each and every day.  Unfortunately, the natural way of creating a life is out of the question for us.  The only way we (Megan) will be able to conceive is through donor sperm and IUI treatment.  Some days, the inability to become pregnant the natural way is bothersome to the both of us, but most days we support each other in staying positive and excited because there is still hope.  The hope of starting our own family and becoming the parents we have always dreamed of being is still alive; we just need your help!</p>
<h3><strong>Aid that we need...</strong></h3>
<p>We need to raise $5,000 to get a start on the next chapter of our lives.  A breakdown of cost allocations is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,300 - two vials of donor sperm (the recommended minimum by our doctor)</li>
<li>$200 - cost of return shipping on the tank that is used to deliver the donor sperm</li>
<li>$1,750 - one IUI injection (crossing my fingers it only takes one!)</li>
<li>$750 - fertility medication (Clomid), pre-prenatal vitamins, and prenatal vitamins</li>
<li>$1,000 - co-pays for doctor office visits, pre injection and post injection tests/monitoring</li>
</ul><p>The above listed is an approximate cost for one IUI injection treatment.  If a second and third IUI treatment, or an IVF treatment is needed, it will be an additional cost of somewhere between $2,000 and $10,000 more, so raising anything over our $5,000 goal mark will be a tremendous help!  Every dollar raised that doesn't end up needing to go towards IUI treatment(s) will be spent on purchasing high quality healthy foods for Megan during her pregnancy as well as getting items needed for our baby.</p>
<h3><strong>What your donation means...</strong></h3>
<p>There will never be enough words that could be put together to describe how grateful for and thankful we would forever be of your donation.  Even a $5 donation could change the world for us and make our dreams realities, every little bit helps!  Growing up as a Transgender person, Jake often times felt that he would never be comfortable with his body, be alone all his life, and forget the chance of a child ever knowing him as Dad.  Almost immediately after starting his transition, Jake began to see dramatic differences as his body changed into his true self.  Jake found a soul mate for life in Megan, and will never be alone.  With your help, Jake now has the opportunity to become the Dad he has always wanted to be and further his belief that there is hope out there for Transgender persons!  Five years ago, as a young 20 year old, Megan was convinced that her future would never include children because it simply wasn't a want of hers.  Three years ago, as a maturing 23 year old, Megan's wants started to change, and the idea of having children and becoming a Mom began to take over her brain!  A year and a half ago, the desire to have children burned deep inside both Megan and Jake, but was a long shot to happen due to stress related issues with Jake's transition and with Megan being at a very unhealthy weight.  Fast forward a year and a half to today, Jake is four years into his transition and has seen many of the stresses subside.  Megan has lost nearly 150 pounds, on her own, no weight surgeries!  She is currently the healthiest and most confident in herself that she has ever been.  Megan looks and feels like a completely different person  from the person she was less than two years ago - stunning and one of the most amazing self willed transformations ever.  We have stood together for five years while facing lots of adversity, accepting challenges, and jumping over hurdles.  We stand together today, stronger because of it, with an even greater desire for children, and truly believe that having a child is meant to be.  Your help, regardless of amount, will never be forgotten!</p>
<h3><strong>All forms of support are helpful...</strong></h3>
<p>Although financial support would benefit us the most, we understand that not everyone is able to provide that.  A key part in attaining our financial goal is getting the word of our campaign out and about.  If you are able to, please share word of our campaign with others that you may know, and encourage others to share with others and so on.  Indiegogo share tools are a fast and easy way to share our campaign with others, so please feel free to use them!  Also, feel free to share our story with any Transgender persons, overweight persons, or any persons in general that are feeling the struggles of life rip away at their hopes and dreams.  If Jake can overcome, and Megan can overcome, any and everyone can overcome!</p></div>","Help us turn one shared Dream into a Reality...

The U12 Team is a very elite soccer club that competes at the highest level of youth soccer in California.  The boys come from across Southern California to try and earn a spot on the roster.  Once selected, the boys under the guidance of top flight coaches, travel to tournaments and games throughout the region.The team is coached by two of the best coaches in the country.  Head Coach Greg Curry is currently the Assistant Coach for the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Men's Soccer Team, which is one of the top NCAA Division I teams.  He also was Team Captain, and a member of their 2006 National Championship team.  He then played professionally for the San Jose Earthquakes, before starting his coaching career as an Assistant Coach for Sacramento State.Assistant Coach Tim Vom Steeg is currently the Head Coach for the UCSB Men's Soccer Team, and is the most successful coach in the history of UCSB.  He was the Head Coach of UCSB's 2006 National Championship team, and UCSB's 2004 National Championship runner-up team.  He was also named the 2004 and 2006 NCAA Division I National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) Coach of the Year.To kick off the season, the team competed in it's first tournament in early September, and came home undefeated with the Championship Medal!
About The Club

Santa Barbara Soccer Club (SBSC) is a non profit organization, dedicated to helping soccer players develop the proper fundamentals, skills, confidence, and maturity to be successful on the field, and most importantly, off of it.  Through the teaching of it's members and coaches, each player learns how to improve as an athlete, as a teammate, and how to build friendships.The Santa Barbara Soccer Club has produced three consecutive National Championship soccer teams.  Many players who have participated on teams throughout the organization, have gone on to college scholarships, and some, have even made the professional level.
 

Going To London! 
Almost every soccer player (especially in this age group), dreams of playing in Europe and becoming the next ""Messi,"" ""Ronaldo,"" or even ""Pele!""  Well, the U12 Team has the chance to do this...or at least play in Europe!  
The team has the opportunity to train with, and compete against Academy Teams of professional clubs. The boys will get the chance to see how they ""measure up,"" against other boys who are being groomed by professional teams.  

But, like everything else, dreams don't come cheap.  Between tournament fees, transportation, referee fees, coaches, hotels, meals, and other expenses, the cost per player is expected to be $3,500.  Without the help and support of parents, friends, sponsors, and fundraisers, some players won't be able to participate.This is where you can help!  Please consider giving a tax deductible donation to help the boys.  All donations through this fundraiser go directly to the Santa Barbara Soccer Club U12 Boy's Team, and as mentioned, are tax deductible. Any donation you can give to help the team will be greatly appreciated, and we have some great items to give you to thank you for your support.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are raising funds to buy a recumbent tricycle and accessories for Bill, a
family member in Deland, FL who suffered from a stroke some years back. 
Bill is only able to use one side of his body, but does amazingly well in
spinning classes, and would like to be able to ride a recumbent trike on bike
trails. He is not able to work and has limited income.</p>
<p>The amazing and inspiring thing about Bill is that despite his physical
limitations, he has a great deal of fun, a positive attitude, and a wonderful
sense of humor. Bill has worked hard to re-learn how to walk and to improve his
speech. He shows incredible determination and never complains.</p>
<p>Bill works out regularly at the YMCA in Deland, and has a host of friends
there who love to be around him. I started this campaign to allow friends and
family to contribute to the cost of a Catrike recumbent trike and the
accessories needed to customize the Catrike for Bill's needs (one hand operation
of controls).  Members of Bill's immediate family are paying for the bulk
of the costs, but would appreciate support from the wider community.</p>

Additionally, I required an impacted tooth which worked through the roof of my mouth.  This was causing a painful infection that I had been walking around with for a few years.  Finally, all of my teeth will need to be re-crowned.  This is a large undertaking overseen by a prosthodontist working with several specialists.    </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I haven't been able to chew for close to five years without something falling out of my mouth.  Plus most of my meals are soft food or soup.  Hopefully with your help, I'll be able to continue through the process without additional financial stress.  Please remember each and every dollar counts.</span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Perks &amp; Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/322634/files/20140121205323-IMG_7713_2.jpg?1390366403"" src="""" style=""width: 138px; height: 138px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/322636/files/20140121205427-IMG_9257_2.jpg?1390366467"" src="""" style=""width: 138px; height: 138px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/322638/files/20140121205603-IMG_8865_2.jpg?1390366563"" src="""" style=""width: 138px; height: 138px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/322641/files/20140121205657-photo.JPG?1390366617"" src="""" style=""width: 139px; height: 139px;""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I'm a bit of an amateur photographer with over 1,500 followers on Instagram.  If you have an IG account @il_david is my name.  I put together a few perks using my photographs.  A lot of my photos are architectural abstractions, scenes of New York streets and my travels.</span></p><p>If you are not interested in donating than please spread the word.  Maybe you're part of an HIV positive community.  Quite possibly you know a dentist that cares about everyones teeth.  Also, use the Indiegogo share tools!</p><p>I'm grateful to my friends and family for supporting me in posting this campaign.  It wasn't easy revealing my financial dilemma for the world to see.  </p><p>Thank you for reading my story! </p><p></p><p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/445260/files/20140319110347-smile_flamingo_copy_2.jpg?1395252227"" src="""" style=""width: 218.9123595505618px; height: 328px;""/>                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/445268/files/20140319110442-smile_toucan.jpg_copy_2.jpg?1395252282"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 211.69520547945206px; height: 317px;""/></p><p></p><p>

During that time I've lived through tuberculosis, pneumocystis pneumonia, depression and suicidal thoughts caused by medication, liver cirrhosis, a stroke, speech and cognitive therapy, and sometimes painful neuropathy plus osteoporosis. I've had great medical insurance which alleviated a lot of the financial stress and help me to recover.  It's only the cirrhosis which caused my teeth to decay at such a rapid pace that I'm in this predicament.  Unfortunately, I have no dental insurance.  Plus all of my surgeries are performed by specialists rather than a general dentist so none of their services would be covered anyway.  Months before I started the procedure I had to take almost half my teeth out of my mouth to eat.  Not only was this embarrassing, as most of my friends and acquaintances can verify, but I had difficulty chewing.  To this day I'm always carrying around Fixodent where ever I go.  Please support me to finish all my dental surgeries so I can stop looking like the poster from ""Silence of the Lambs."" (My friend created this for impact. Is it working? lol) Furthermore rid me of that gummy pink paste. I'm not an old man yet.Specifics About The Dental WorkThe total cost of the mouth reconstruction is $51,435.  Yes, even though I'm going to New York University Dental School that's still the cost.  If I saw a private dentist the price would be two or three times more.  Other advantages are the school has the latest in dental technology and every type of specialist under one roof.  Right now I'm about $14,000 in and a year and a half through the surgeries.  First my bite needed to be corrected.  My mouth had a combination of some solid teeth, while others demand root canals and five are intended for implants.  My lower gums will have to be trimmed and my under gums with have to be lengthen by a skin graph. Additionally, I required an impacted tooth which worked through the roof of my mouth.  This was causing a painful infection that I had been walking around with for a few years.  Finally, all of my teeth will need to be re-crowned.  This is a large undertaking overseen by a prosthodontist working with several specialists.    I haven't been able to chew for close to five years without something falling out of my mouth.  Plus most of my meals are soft food or soup.  Hopefully with your help, I'll be able to continue through the process without additional financial stress.  Please remember each and every dollar counts.Perks & Other Ways You Can Help   I'm a bit of an amateur photographer with over 1,500 followers on Instagram.  If you have an IG account @il_david is my name.  I put together a few perks using my photographs.  A lot of my photos are architectural abstractions, scenes of New York streets and my travels.If you are not interested in donating than please spread the word.  Maybe you're part of an HIV positive community.  Quite possibly you know a dentist that cares about everyones teeth.  Also, use the Indiegogo share tools!I'm grateful to my friends and family for supporting me in posting this campaign.  It wasn't easy revealing my financial dilemma for the world to see.  Thank you for reading my story!

<h3>In the Gaza Strip, like everywhere in the world, the number of cancer patients is increasing. If compared to other countries, the difference is that it’s not easy to get required medicine inside the Strip and in most cases people cannot afford to buy them due to the big percentage of poverty.</h3>
<p>One of the cases is Maria , a 13 years old girl from the middle of Gaza. She is a smart little girl, with a big mind and optimistic soul. Maria started to feel sick about 4 years ago. Her parents took her to the hospital in Gaza but due to the situation in the Ministry of health - Gaza is so critical because the blockade and siege which have been imposed by Israel in 2005/2006 -  the doctors advised her to go to Egypt.</p>
<p>The doctors in Egypt made her a CT- Scan. The results showed a tumor in the left optic nerve. The size of the malignant cell was 2.5 cm and it was going to metastasize more. Maria started to lose her vision by the time and the doctors prescribed her immediately oral chemotherapy.</p>
<p>The medicine she is using are:</p>
<p>1-  Temodal 100mg (<span class=""st"">Temozolomide</span> ) each box contains 5 capsules.</p>
<p>2-  Zofran 8mg (<span class=""st"">Ondansetron Hydrochloride) each box contains 10 tablets.</span></p>
<p><span class=""st""> </span></p>
<p>She started taking Temodal 100mg with the dose 3 capsules/week and  Zofran 8mg 2 tab/week.</p>
<p>So she needed 2 ½  boxes of Temodal and one box of Zofran per month.</p>
<p>Her parents started to search for the medicines in private pharmacies but they found out that are too expensive. Her father decided to sell his car and some other stuff from the house to be able to cover the expenses for the medicines since his salary wasn't enough to cover the daily life expenses.</p>
<p>In that time I got a phone call from her dad asking me for help. Someone suggested me as a link because I’m a pharmacist and have contacts with different medical drug stores.  </p>
<p>I started to work hard to find it out asking organizations in and outside the Gaza Strip for help. Then I started to make urgent calls to all my friends across the world to donate money and to help this way to buy the medicines. Luckily I got some funds which were enough to cover the cost of the drugs for a few months. Some other friends managed to send this expensive medicine directly from their country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A couple of months ago Maria went again to Egypt for another check up. The results were  amazingly changed. The tumor’s size reduced from 2.5 to 1.5 cm and hopefully it will reduce more and disappear. Since the medicine worked well for her, the doctors decided to let her  continue with them for 3 more months but with an increased dose.</p>
<p>The new doses are:</p>
<p>Temodal 100mg 4 capsules/week and Zofran 8mg 4 tablets/week. In total it's 9 ½ boxes of Temodal and 5 boxes of Zofran for 3 months.</p>
<p>After these 3 months she will have another check up in Cairo. We all hope that the Cancer will disappared forever.</p>
<p>I’ve been helping Maria for a year and a half (with a big support by my friends) and she became part of the family. It is hard to see a child suffering where general life conditions are also difficult. If you consider her as your daughter or sister you will always do what you can to help her survive. This can only happen if all of us work united to reach the goal and supply her with the very expensive medicine necessary for the treatment. Make a difference, help her now. Please make a donation, any amount is most appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can't donate, we understand, but please share this link with your friends, be it by e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Funds Raised Above Goal and Extra money.<br/></strong></p>

In the Gaza Strip, like everywhere in the world, the number of cancer patients is increasing. If compared to other countries, the difference is that it’s not easy to get required medicine inside the Strip and in most cases people cannot afford to buy them due to the big percentage of poverty.
One of the cases is Maria , a 13 years old girl from the middle of Gaza. She is a smart little girl, with a big mind and optimistic soul. Maria started to feel sick about 4 years ago. Her parents took her to the hospital in Gaza but due to the situation in the Ministry of health - Gaza is so critical because the blockade and siege which have been imposed by Israel in 2005/2006 -  the doctors advised her to go to Egypt.
The doctors in Egypt made her a CT- Scan. The results showed a tumor in the left optic nerve. The size of the malignant cell was 2.5 cm and it was going to metastasize more. Maria started to lose her vision by the time and the doctors prescribed her immediately oral chemotherapy.
The medicine she is using are:
1-  Temodal 100mg (Temozolomide ) each box contains 5 capsules.
2-  Zofran 8mg (Ondansetron Hydrochloride) each box contains 10 tablets.
 
She started taking Temodal 100mg with the dose 3 capsules/week and  Zofran 8mg 2 tab/week.
So she needed 2 ½  boxes of Temodal and one box of Zofran per month.
Her parents started to search for the medicines in private pharmacies but they found out that are too expensive. Her father decided to sell his car and some other stuff from the house to be able to cover the expenses for the medicines since his salary wasn't enough to cover the daily life expenses.
In that time I got a phone call from her dad asking me for help. Someone suggested me as a link because I’m a pharmacist and have contacts with different medical drug stores.  
I started to work hard to find it out asking organizations in and outside the Gaza Strip for help. Then I started to make urgent calls to all my friends across the world to donate money and to help this way to buy the medicines. Luckily I got some funds which were enough to cover the cost of the drugs for a few months. Some other friends managed to send this expensive medicine directly from their country.
 
A couple of months ago Maria went again to Egypt for another check up. The results were  amazingly changed. The tumor’s size reduced from 2.5 to 1.5 cm and hopefully it will reduce more and disappear. Since the medicine worked well for her, the doctors decided to let her  continue with them for 3 more months but with an increased dose.
The new doses are:
Temodal 100mg 4 capsules/week and Zofran 8mg 4 tablets/week. In total it's 9 ½ boxes of Temodal and 5 boxes of Zofran for 3 months.
After these 3 months she will have another check up in Cairo. We all hope that the Cancer will disappared forever.
I’ve been helping Maria for a year and a half (with a big support by my friends) and she became part of the family. It is hard to see a child suffering where general life conditions are also difficult. If you consider her as your daughter or sister you will always do what you can to help her survive. This can only happen if all of us work united to reach the goal and supply her with the very expensive medicine necessary for the treatment. Make a difference, help her now. Please make a donation, any amount is most appreciated.

How SenceHub can turn those raw ECG signals into emotional insights</p><p>Once you understand both these concepts you'll really grasp why Sence is so revolutionary! Let's take a look at both these pillars individually.</p><p><b>SenceBand's ECG Tracking from One Wrist</b></p><p>SenceBand measures ECG using a patent-pending technology that allows it to cancel out the electromagnetic ""noise"" from your body. This mechanism filters out things like electrical signals from muscle contractions and leaves only the electromagnetic feed from your heart (ECG) . This filtering method is completely novel and makes SenceBand the only smart bracelet capable of measure ECG from one wrist.</p><p>How accurate is Sence? Below is the result of a test that was done that compared Sence to a standard, medical-grade ECG device. You'll see that the R-peaks (the critical phenomena to understanding true heart-rate and emotions) match up perfectly with the medical grade control.</p><div data-id=""14290265""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480362283/gisn5sl3zqkixf1eeumh.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>But don't take our word for it!

Aren't emotions all about what is going on in your brain? What does the heart have to do with emotions? Actually, there is an intimate link between the brain and heart. In fact, the heart's nervous system even contains 40,000 neurons!</p><div data-id=""14290487""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480362283/qitm6rt3xsvtdmwrf8al.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Your heart rate is determined by the two competing systems in the body: The <b>sympathetic</b> and the <b>parasympathetic</b> nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is known as the <b>""fight or flight""</b> pathway and it tries to pull your heart in a direction of excitement. The parasympathetic nervous system is known as the <b>""rest and digest""</b> pathway and tries to mellow your heart out and slow down its beats. All our emotions leave a unique footprint in this constant battle between sympathetic and parasympathetic control. These footprints can be read using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis of ECG data. Since Sence accurately tracks R-peaks it can identify the unique signals associated with each emotion.</p><div data-id=""14290495""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480362284/lw2knf8h5eowqd4xemko.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p><b>How Many Emotions can Sence Track?</b></p><p>With Sence's unique ability to analyze heart rate variability, it can track 64 different emotions and bodily states in you and your loved ones.

Originally, the Sence team assembled not to build a revolutionary hardware device but to collect high quality ECG screening data. With this data, they build a huge database that they hoped to sell to others. In order to acquire this data the Sence team set out with the monumental goal of screening 20,000 patients in rural Ukraine with a mobile hospital made up of 24 doctors, 24 nurses and modern ECG equipment. They planned to provide free check-ups and health guidance to these individuals who had little access to healthcare in exchange for their anonymous ECG data.</p><div data-id=""14295902""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480362291/vkfgth6zd1hw3oe2umbk.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Sound like an impossible task?

Every emotion causes your heart to beat in a slightly different way. Think about how differently your heart beats when you are in a rage versus when you are in a calm state of serene happiness.These, tiny changes in the heart rate are untraceable with traditional wearables. Sence uses revolutionary technology that allows it to track these differences using ECG (aka EKG) signals. ECG analysis is 250 times more precise that existing fitness trackers and smart watches and Sence is the first to release a technology that can measure ECG from one wrist. With this unprecedented level of accuracy it is not surprising people are calling Sence a “breakthrough”.Sence’s insights can give you more data about your wellbeing than ever before. Sence can track precisely when and where you experience:By applying this data, Sence can help you: Sence can recognize the minute variations in between your heart’s contractions. Using ECG (also known as EKG) tracking technology. Sence is the first wearable to be able to track ECG from one wrist which allows it to take readings all day and collect the data it needs to train you on how to maximize your happiness and reduce your sadness. SenceHub’s powerful algorithms turn the raw data provided by SenceBand into actionable analytics. Using SenceHub you’ll be able to: 1. Track your stress, vitality and emotions so you can adjust your daily routine to maximize happiness and productivity.2. Track your daily physical activity, steps, heart rate and vitality levels. Now you'll finally know what time of day is YOUR best to pump iron or go for a run by understanding how your vitality naturally ebbs and flows.  3. Get notifications when something interesting recently happened with your own emotional states or to those of someone in your network. This will help you understand the kind of support you can offer whether it be giving them their space, going to cheer them up or anywhere in between.   Sence can be used in different ways and it will bring many benefits depending on your goals: Help decide a part of SenceBand's fate by voting for your favorite color in the public comments. You can vote for one of our suggestions above or come up with your own. But remember, only votes posted in the public comment section will be tallied so let's get the conversation going! SenceHub: Your Beacon for Self-MasteryWith each ECG scan, SenceHub syncs up with your calendar and takes a snapshot of your location so you know exactly when and where the scan was taken. This gives you maximum insight into the origins of each emotion so you can identify patterns and course correct. With SenceBand’s unprecedented precision and accuracy it has the functionality to extract some of your body’s most valuable information. Use it to best understand your body and mind in ways you never thought possible. You can also share it with your friends and family to stay in tune and connected to the well being of those you love.  SenceBand: With its R-peak tracking technology, SenceBand collects high-resolution data from your heart. SenceBand has:  Sence’s mobile app, SenceHub, contains sophisticated algorithms that analyze the data provided by SenceBand and presents them to you in exquisite detail. SenceHub features:Although ALL the SenceHub features described in this campaign are free, we will provide each backer with a free 1-month premium plan subscription as well. This unlocks access to even more features that we are currently developing to give you even deeper insight into your life. Consider this just one way of us saying ""thank you"" for supporting us on our journey. The amount of premium features unlocked will depend on the amount we raise so don't forget to share this campaign to help unlock even more premium features!  Customer Service Specialist 1Customer Service Specialist 2Few people realize, but many traditional fitness tracking wearables use outdated technologies such as optical sensors that end up only being about 70% accuracy in measuring your heart’s activities.The bottom line is that these sensors track pulse waves, which are phenomena caused by the heart beat but which also have many other, unrelated factors that effect their frequency. Besides, you can track your pulse with your own finger! Why pick a device that tracks a phenomenon you can track yourself? Sence tracks something fundamentally different and dramatically more precise: electrocardiography (ECG)Now you can see why Sence is able to track data that is so much more accurate than what's out there. Curious about how Sence can track ECG from just one wrist or how it uses that data to tell you what emotions you've experienced? Keep on reading!There are two main pillars to understanding how the science behind Sence works:1. How SenceBand can accurately measure ECG signals from one wrist2. How SenceHub can turn those raw ECG signals into emotional insightsOnce you understand both these concepts you'll really grasp why Sence is so revolutionary! Let's take a look at both these pillars individually.SenceBand's ECG Tracking from One WristSenceBand measures ECG using a patent-pending technology that allows it to cancel out the electromagnetic ""noise"" from your body. This mechanism filters out things like electrical signals from muscle contractions and leaves only the electromagnetic feed from your heart (ECG) . This filtering method is completely novel and makes SenceBand the only smart bracelet capable of measure ECG from one wrist.How accurate is Sence? Below is the result of a test that was done that compared Sence to a standard, medical-grade ECG device. You'll see that the R-peaks (the critical phenomena to understanding true heart-rate and emotions) match up perfectly with the medical grade control.But don't take our word for it! Check out our SenceBand prototype in action for yourself in the uncut demo videos below. We made them to show SenceBand's current prototype functionality so there are no doubts we are well on our way to a final product:Video 1: Sence's ECG SignalVideo 2: Sence Tracking EmotionsFeel free to skip to 3:25 for the test results if you wish!Getting Emotions from ECG AnalysisOkay, so now you understand how SenceBand tracks ECG signals from just one wrist, but how can this help to infer anything about emotions? Aren't emotions all about what is going on in your brain? What does the heart have to do with emotions? Actually, there is an intimate link between the brain and heart. In fact, the heart's nervous system even contains 40,000 neurons!Your heart rate is determined by the two competing systems in the body: The sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is known as the ""fight or flight"" pathway and it tries to pull your heart in a direction of excitement. The parasympathetic nervous system is known as the ""rest and digest"" pathway and tries to mellow your heart out and slow down its beats. All our emotions leave a unique footprint in this constant battle between sympathetic and parasympathetic control. These footprints can be read using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis of ECG data. Since Sence accurately tracks R-peaks it can identify the unique signals associated with each emotion. How Many Emotions can Sence Track?With Sence's unique ability to analyze heart rate variability, it can track 64 different emotions and bodily states in you and your loved ones. Specifically, Sence can track 2 flavours (intensity levels) of each of the 32 emotions found below in Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, a standard emotional reference tool in medicine and psychology:Don't get overwhelmed with all these emotions! Sence lets you pick the emotions to track that matter most to you and your lifestyle. The insight you glean from Sence can be as specific or broad as you want it to be.Further Scientific Reading:Want to dig deeper into the Science behind Sence?

You'll be able to let people know if you had a generally good or bad day or even show them exactly what emotions you felt and where. This allows people using Sence become connected in ways never before possible, without even needing to be in the same room (or even country)!Sence for Couples Sence allows you understand not only your own emotions but those of that special someone. Know when to give them space or when they need a little pick me up! Be the best partner you can be with these revolutionary emotional insights.Sence for Families Track the health and emotional wellbeing of the more sensitive members of your family such as children so you can keep them safe and sound. With Sence you can get the insight you need to be the best parent or caregiver you can be.Sence for Friends With Sence you can get way more insight into your peer group than with a social media post. Are The Boys feeling a bit down lately as a group? Maybe it’s time to go out for a night on the town! Sence connects you to your friends in ways that go way beyond words, pictures or even videos to make you feel more connected then ever before.The Sence story features a long and winding journey with an unlikely origin. Originally, the Sence team assembled not to build a revolutionary hardware device but to collect high quality ECG screening data. With this data, they build a huge database that they hoped to sell to others. In order to acquire this data the Sence team set out with the monumental goal of screening 20,000 patients in rural Ukraine with a mobile hospital made up of 24 doctors, 24 nurses and modern ECG equipment. They planned to provide free check-ups and health guidance to these individuals who had little access to healthcare in exchange for their anonymous ECG data.Sound like an impossible task? The Sence team actually exceeded expectations and comprehensively screened 22,433 patients in 52 days. This unprecedented study got Planexta (the makers of Sence) many adulations worldwide from cardiac societies and the like.Planexta Inc. is officially recognized to have performed the largest cardio screening ever to test for 260 parameters in under 52 days by a National records society.With the massive amount data Planexta now had, they set out to find the right wearable technology company to sell it to. Unfortunately, they didn’t find a good fit! All the current devices either didn’t use rigorous enough ECG measurements to make use of the data or they measured ECG in such an impractical way that users would never take enough readings for the data to be useable.What a waste! So much data was now available but there was no wearable sophisticated enough to use it. Instead of giving up, the Sence team decided to take it upon themselves to create (from scratch) an ECG measuring wearable that was both accurate and extremely practical for consumers to use. They created a lab dedicated to this task called Platform20k (as a memento of the monumental screening tour) and hired 13 top experimental physicists and engineers, the begin work on SenceBand.It took the team over a year to succeed, but SenceBand became a reality due to the discovery and implementation of a whole new method of measuring ECG. Now, Sence has the hardware and the software foundations to do something truly revolutionary. However, Sence is still a scrappy little company and genuinely needs YOUR help to actualize the immense potential Sence technology has to improve people's lives. The Sence team thanks you for every last dollar of support! SenceBand’s design was created by the famous Red Dot Award winner, Donn Koh and his Singaporean team at Stuck Design. Before helping to create SenceBand he worked on multiple projects for Microsoft, Dell, Samsung, HTC and T-Mobile. Our engineers and physicists worked closely with Donn Koh’s team to ensure technological prowess and aesthetics could co-exist in SenceBand’s unmistakable appearance.

With a maternal mortality rate of 0%, a Cesarean rate of just 6%, and a maternal satisfaction rate of 98%, freestanding birth centers play an integral role in improving maternity care and birth outcomes in the U.S. The stakes are high and we NEED more birth centers.While our immediate next step is to open a location in Tucson - a metropolitan city with no freestanding birth center - our ultimate goal is to expand into several cities over the coming years. Your contribution to this campaign will help grow birth centers and provide midwifery care to as many families as possible.To make Babymoon Inn of Tucson a reality, we need your help! Your donations will help create a space to serve Tucson families for years to come.  If you know firsthand the impact birth centers have on communities, your life has been touched by a midwife, or you simply want to support women and babies by providing them with a safe, evidence-based option for pregnancy and birth, please consider donating at one of the following levels. When Julia and Steven Hall moved to Phoenix after a personally life-changing experience with birth center care in Texas, they discovered there weren’t any local birth centers in the Phoenix area and knew that had to change. Thus, Babymoon Inn was born and has been serving and growing families since 2010. Beginning as a single building offering out-of-hospital birth, Babymoon of Phoenix has since expanded to four buildings that include full-scope midwifery care, comprehensive childbirth education, group prenatal appointments, doula services, lactation support, prenatal and therapeutic massage, facials, chiropractic care, and primary care.However, it is the people who walk through our doors every day that are the heart and soul of Babymoon Inn. Our clients (from first-time parents to families having their fourth Babymoon Inn baby) and our committed and passionate team members, all devoted to improving maternity care and demanding better outcomes for moms and babies, are the reason Babymoon exists and has grown to become a safe space for so many women and their families throughout pregnancy and postpartum.Every dollar donated will help bring this model of care to Tucson families. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for supporting us in bringing a new freestanding birth center to Tucson.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Vegan Health and Fitness Magazine is a brand new quarterly magazine jam-packed with workout tips, inspirational interviews,cutting edge scientific information, healthy recipes, and more-- for the whole family, from kids to seniors!  On top of all of that, each issue breaks stereotypes and features vegans who have achieved in all areas of fitness, from bodybuilding to endurance sports, from calisthenics to professional sports.</p>
<p>Our very first issue was Summer 2012 and was published in June. It featured vegan bodybuilder and best-selling author Robert Cheeke with vegan fitness model Koya Webb on the cover.  It was carried by over 170 natural grocery stores across the nation, including Whole Foods, Earthfare, Mother's Markets, Sprouts, Sunflower Markets, and Lassen's.  The first issue sold out in many locations in less than a week! Because of  the great response, our distributors more than doubled their orders for our second issue (Fall 2012), and we broadened our distribution to nearly a thousand stores across the US and Canada, including Barnes and Noble and Books-a-Million stores. </p>
<p>The fall issue is also selling very well (in fact it is selling out all over the place once again), and our distributors are saying that they want to double their orders again for our upcoming winter issue.  The only problem is that we don't have the money on hand to pay for the printing of that many copies yet.  The problem is that most advertisers have a policy of not advertising with magazines that have not been around for at least a year. But we don't want to wait that long to meet the demand for this magazine. We want to help make the world a fitter more compassionate place right away!  That's why we need your help!</p>

through the ladder rung and did a karate chop on my leg on impact which snapped
my tib and fib protruding them through my skin. It was not pretty.</p>
<p>I am still in the hospital and waiting for the swelling etc
to subside so that they can put all my pieces together with plates and screws.</p>
<p>I am blessed with good care and that it was not worse, but I
am afraid my insurance will not cover everything and when I am released I have
to come back for 20 hyperbaric treatments. One of the things not covered is transportation to and from the hospital for the 20 treatments and any sort of disability while I cannot work:(<br/></p>
<p>I will more than likely be laid up for 3 or 4 months without
any way to earn an income and pay my bills :(.</p>
<p>I am not sure how I will meet the $3,000 ish monthly

Even if we do not reach this goal, we will be putting any money gathered from this campaign towards buying medication and other items to improve the health of the patients we see. Because of this, any donation, no matter how small would be greatly appreciated and will be used to impact and change the lives of those we meet in the Dominican Republic. The ImpactWe are working towards creating a sustainable health care for the Haitian population in the bateys, but until that is established, we will continue to provide care as nursing students in the best way we know how. This money will be used to lower blood pressure, provide pain relief, promote adequate growth in children, help mothers sustain a health pregnancy, and dress wounds of the patients we encounter in the Dominican Republic. Other Ways You Can HelpJust getting our mission heard by as many people as possible will help with our campaign, so we all would greatly appreciate it if you could pass the word along about our mission!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Jonas Barnes. This campaign is for my nephew, Lawrence Melius and his parents. Recently, Lawrence was diagnosed with a very rare kidney tumor known as Wilm's Tumor. At only 2 years old, this is quite taxing on the little guy. As if that wasn't enough, his parents will be at a huge financial loss due to the treatment. Best case scenario, they will be paying $50,000 out of pocket on top of being out of work for over 3 months. They are family. And that is why I am going to do everything I possibly can to help them with this emotional and financial toll.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign will help a family under extreme financial and emotional distress due to a terrible tragedy that has fallen upon them. It will help keep food on their table and roof over their head while they deal with the treatment that their son will need to fight his disease. This money will help with medical costs, everyday costs while they are out of work caring for their son in and out of the hospital and will allow them to live as normal of a life as possible while they go through this ordeal.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would never ask for the amount of money that they will be shouldering, but any amount will be an enormous help. I have set a goal of $5,000 and I think that will make a significant financial dent. The amount raised, whether it meets the goal or not, will all go to the Melius family to help with these costs. This is also only one phase of the campaign.<br/><br/>Locally, I am putting on fundraisers as well. I am a stand up comedian in the Pacific Northwest and will be doing 3 shows to raise funds for them as well. These shows, coupled with the help from all of you, will allow me to help my family deal with this tragedy without having added stress of a debt that will reach, at the lowest, $50,000.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>[Here's how:]</b></span></h3>
<h3>Praxis- We put our ideas into action.</h3>
<p>SocMed runs an immersion course in Uganda that incorporates innovative teaching methodologies to merge teaching of medicine with understanding of the socioeconomic, cultural, political, and historical underpinnings of illness. </p>
<h3>Personal- We know where we come from matters.</h3>
<p>Who we are and where we come from matters deeply in healthcare delivery. Critical self-awareness enhances our ability to undo harmful structural and societal factors of which we are all part. </p>
<h3>Partnership- We advance equity, together.</h3>
<p>SocMed utilizes a curriculum that emphasizes building personal partnerships and reflection upon personal experiences with power, privilege, race, class, gender, and sexual orientation as central to effective partnership building in global health.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>[Where your money goes:]</h2>
<h3>SocMed is a young organization, and donating a little will go a long way:</h3>

[Are you?] 




[We are giving up rights until we raise the amounts shown to stand up for health equity.]



[Challenge of the day to YOU:]
TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORT WHEN YOU NORMALLY WOULD NOT
(Don't forget tell us how your challenge affects you by using #askwhyproject on Facebook!)



Thank you. Your impact is vital.
With your support we are raising funds for SocMed, a nonprofit that focuses on how social determinants (e.g. not drinking water, eating, or having a bed to sleep in) can impact the health and wellbeing of individuals and society. 
The impact of SocMed is vital. 
[Here's why:]
SocMed works to educate and inspire future health care leaders to look beyond the biologic basis of disease and to stand in solidarity with those most affected by the social determinants of health. This understanding frames equity in a direct relationship to health outcomes, transforming our system for a more just world. 

[Here's how:]
Praxis- We put our ideas into action.
SocMed runs an immersion course in Uganda that incorporates innovative teaching methodologies to merge teaching of medicine with understanding of the socioeconomic, cultural, political, and historical underpinnings of illness. 
Personal- We know where we come from matters.
Who we are and where we come from matters deeply in healthcare delivery. Critical self-awareness enhances our ability to undo harmful structural and societal factors of which we are all part. 
Partnership- We advance equity, together.
SocMed utilizes a curriculum that emphasizes building personal partnerships and reflection upon personal experiences with power, privilege, race, class, gender, and sexual orientation as central to effective partnership building in global health.

[Where your money goes:]
SocMed is a young organization, and donating a little will go a long way:

Providing scholarships for students from resource-limited settings who could not otherwise attend the course 
Financially supporting Aaron and Missy as they travel to Uganda to maximize the potential of SocMed


[What YOU get:]
As a thank you for standing with us for health equity, you will receive one or more of the following:

[Challenge Updates:]


Level 1=$500, Drinking water

We got headaches, dry mouths, and lightheaded. We weren't sure if this was from lack of caffeine or dehydration. Either way, we thank you for kicking off this project strong and sharing our passion for health equity!
Why? Nearly 1 billion people in the developing world walk on average 3.5 miles to get water to drink.Level 2=$1000, Sleeping on hard floors

Last night proved to be more challenging that I expected. I don't remember much in-between Midnight and 3am, fading in and out of consciousness, unable to sit up without the experiencing nausea and feeling light headed. Around 3am, I think, I received the news that I could sleep due to many generous donation, including that of my parents. I go to lay back down on the floor, but immediately had to sit up. I got sick several times in the trashcan, but all that left my body was of course the water I had been drinking in attempts to fill my empty stomach. --BrookeWhy? Aaron and Missy's brothers and sisters (ages 5-19) in Cameroon were forced by their father to get only 4.5 hours of sleep per night before awaking again to clean, cook over a fire, and study with what little concentration they could manage.Level 3=$1500, eating white rice (without silverware)
We woke up this morning and groggily checked our contributions page and immediately perked up--we got rice for breakfast!!!! Using only our hands, we could only manage to stomach a little of the flavorless stuff without feeling full and sick, but it was such a welcome source of nourishment. 
Why? Because malnutrition is estimated to contribute to one-third of all child deaths worldwide.  


Level 4=$1750, shoesWhile walking in the hard gravel, Brooke tried walking in the grass. She was stung by a bee on her foot within hours of not having shoes. We also felt ourselves being really vigilant about potential broken glass after the homecoming weekend on campus. Why? Over 300 million children worldwide are without shoes, and along with basic sanitation, shoes help prevent the spread of parasitic diseases that plague over 1.4 billion people worldwide.


Level 5=$2000, oral hygieneOur mouths got fuzzy on the inside and definitely stinky. We found ourselves embarrassed to get too close to people to talk. Why? In Cameroon I witnessed infected teeth turn into body-eating bacteria colonies that whittled people to the bone, all because they were oppressed by a system that did not ensure them basic oral hygiene. 


Level 6=$2200, eat vegetarian dietWe were eating about 500-700 calories of white rice per day. Brooke and Missy each lost about 8-9 pounds in this time. Why? Rice is the staple food for over 3 billion people (most of them poor) constituting over half of the world's population. For those of you interested more deeply check out this article about rice and US food-aid policy: http://www.globalresearch.ca/haiti-aid-or-trade...

Level 7=$2400 bucket showersWe get to shower! With buckets!!! (Or in this case, a coffee pot! Which actually works really well!)Why? An American taking a five-minute shower uses more water than the average person in a developing country slum uses for an entire day.Level 8=$2600, sleeping in bedsWe will NOT have to sleep on the floor tonight! :) Why? An estimated 150 million adults are suffering from sleep-related problems across the developing world that are linked to an increase in problems like depression and anxiety.
Level 9=$2800, hand washingThis was something that was surprisingly hard to NOT do accidentally. We all had hand washing really ingrained into our habits and found it hard to not do unconsciously. We take this simple habit for granted so much when in reality it is not something everyone can do easily. In the hospital in Cameroon, for example, soap was very hard to come by in a place it was desperately needed.Why? The simple act of washing hands at critical times can reduce the number of diarrhoeal cases by up to 35%


Level 10=$3000, hygieneWe didn't use any products for hygiene, shave, or brush our hair. We got stinky. We felt like people were grossed out by us, and thus didn't interact with as many people very closely, even each other. Why? People may have internalized biases about how to treat people who smell or appear unclean. We need to be conscious to keep our biases in check and treat people with love and respect. 


Level 11=$3200, cold showersIcy water all over your body is surprisingly unpleasant in the morning...Why? Cold showers are terrible. Not everyone can afford running water, much less hot water. I will always remember our 5 year old host brother in Cameroon crying and shivering. every. single. time. he got bathed with freezing cold water. 
Level 12=$3400, using silverware 
We got strange looks in public, and were definitely wary of eating with only our hands during the week we couldn't wash them. Why? Clean hands cut the number of child deaths from diarrhea (the second leading cause of child deaths) by almost half and from pneumonia (the leading cause of child deaths) by one-quarter. 

Level 13 = $3600, clean clothesOops! We're sideways! But we still feel great from having clean clothes to change into! Why? People may ""view"" others who are unable to dress ""sharp"" in a negative light due to implicit biases. How does this article tell someone they should feel if they are unable to dress in a certain way? Should things change?
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/do-clothes-make-the-manager/



Level 14 =$3800, eating meat
We love chicken and fish, but we hope to be more mindful while consuming meat going forward.
Why? While traveling, we've learned that meat is sometimes eaten scarcely in some areas due to the high cost of production. It can be a sign of privilege and honor. 



Level 15 = $4000, drink any beverage you please
We love water, but we love coffee more sometimes. Brooke was especially appreciative to attain this level as a busy college student with a never-ending schedule of events, meetings, and tests. 
Why? 780 million people worldwide lack access to clean water. Try to remember this more often and be mindful every day.  Check out water.org for quick world water facts. 



Level 16 = $4200, phone use
Phones were the easiest to accidentally forget. We are seemingly attached to our phones at all times and it's very second nature to answer a phone call or text. 
Why? Mobile phones are increasingly ubiquitous in poor countries, which now account for four in every five connections worldwide.



Level 17 = $4600, car use
Missy and Aaron went from Lincoln, NE to Sioux Falls, SD to Minneapolis, MN because of the generosity of friends, family, busses, and trains! Thanks for the help!
Why? People facing poverty rely heavily on public transportation and pay inflated prices (in terms of time and direct charges.)



Level 18 = $4800, hot water
Don't you just love hot showers in the morning? We do too. We found ourselves simply bathing less to avoid the freezing cold water. (Probably not the most hygienic activity.) 
Why? Hot showers are not the common experience in low and middle-income countries, and are

I am having a lot of trouble finding a job. My family is not badly-off, but they did spend over 75,000 dollars on rehab for me. They are willing to pay for the double incision process but probably not any other masculinizing procedure. Insurance will probably cover nothing.</p>
<p>I am NOT EXPECTING THE TOTAL AMOUNT I HAVE SET, I will be happy with anything, but this is a very costly thing to do.</p>
<p>Hopefully I can get an appointment with Dr. Garramone, but if not there are local surgeons I can turn to.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I will use the money for:<br/><ul>
<li>Travel funds (I may need a plane ticket, if not I still need gas/tolls)</li>
<li>Double incision chest reassignment (probably around 7,000)</li>
<li>POSSIBLY body contouring and liposuction for a generally masculine shape (max. 5000)</li>
</ul>The perks are not fantastic, but they are all I can offer at the moment, since as I said it will be very hard for me to find a job, and if I do it will be barely minimum wage.</div>

</div><div> <p>I experience daily severe dysphoria about my body. I bind my chest for over 6 hours a day when I go out, which hinders my breathing and causes back/shoulder problems for me. </p>
<p>This surgery would boost my confidence and curb my anxiety immensely. I can pass as male decently enough without it, but I would love to donate my binders and do things such as go swimming.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As previously stated, I'm not expecting the total amount of money I have as my goal. I'm not at a terrible risk of not getting it, but as I also previously said, my parents shelled out a lot for that rehab and I'm not thrilled about making them pay for the rest of it.</p>

Travel funds (I may need a plane ticket, if not I still need gas/tolls)
Double incision chest reassignment (probably around 7,000)
POSSIBLY body contouring and liposuction for a generally masculine shape (max. 5000)
The perks are not fantastic, but they are all I can offer at the moment, since as I said it will be very hard for me to find a job, and if I do it will be barely minimum wage.
The Impact
 I experience daily severe dysphoria about my body. I bind my chest for over 6 hours a day when I go out, which hinders my breathing and causes back/shoulder problems for me. 
This surgery would boost my confidence and curb my anxiety immensely. I can pass as male decently enough without it, but I would love to donate my binders and do things such as go swimming.

  Risks & Challenges As previously stated, I'm not expecting the total amount of money I have as my goal. I'm not at a terrible risk of not getting it, but as I also previously said, my parents shelled out a lot for that rehab and I'm not thrilled about making them pay for the rest of it.

In Québec, nearly 50% of veterinarians are using Euthabag and in Canada, 4% overall and in the US only 0,005%!. We have worked tirelessly to provide a product that is accessible to all and that the era of trash bags can be deemed over. The use of the garbage bag is not only an insult to the integrity of the animal health teams that work so hard to provide the best care for our animals, but also to the human-animal bond. In order to maintain our low cost, so that Euthabag can be available to everyone, we will need to capture a critical mass of clients in the rest of Canada and the United States. Even when a new product responds perfectly to a need, we must invest heavily in advertising to encourage change in peoples habits.  Educational webinars are one of the best channels used to help broadcast information. In our case, they would be used to enable experienced and young veterinarians alike, the opportunity to improve their veterinary services for families who have had to go through the painful ordeal of losing a pet. Currently, the curriculum vets receive unfortunately doesn't support much training in these areas.   The production and distribution of these online seminars is expensive but will help better train veterinarians to improve their end-of-life services and also accept this product as a new practice standard. Your contribution will be used to help better prepare and train veterinarians while helping to make the product known.  If this topic touches your heart, please share and don't forget to talk to your veterinarian!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Duik brings the easy <b>Inverse Kinematics (IK) to After
Effects</b>.<br/>IK is about being able to rig and animate a character
a lot more naturally.<br/><br/>For example let's say you had to animate
an arm sway. Normally in After Effects you would <b>separate the arm
into bones</b> (arm, forearm and hand). Once you had parented all the
bones you would then have to animate each part separately - that's
what is called <b>Forward Kinematics</b> (<b>FK</b>). But, whatever
you keyed on the shoulder (rotation, scale or position), would have
an effect on the forearm and hand (rotation, scale, position). It was
always a balancing act. At the end of animating an arm, you would end
up with a mass of key frames, each individually affecting the limbs
(bones). This would make tweaking and adjusting the animation a
bleedin’ nightmare.<br/><br/><b>With IK you have one controller</b>.
Through the arm you place bones which, like before, you create a
parenting system (Hand to forearm, forearm to arm). You then hit this
magic button which creates a fully possible arm. The unique thing
about this, is you only animate the controller. This means less key
frames and less fuss. Unlike before you can now tweak and reanimate
with ease.</p>
<p>This tool is essential in many cases – to animate a character,
especially for a walk, a run; to animate mechanical processes of any
kind, etc. – inverse kinematics implied the use of very complex
trigonometrical expressions in After Effects (see <a href=""http://www.motionscript.com/design-guide/ik.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.motionscript.com/design-guide/ik.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DanEbberts</a>‘s expressions).<br/>Duik automates this creation process
to allow the animator to focus on the animation! A simple controller
at the end of an arm, of a leg, or on the shoulders, an IK that was
created in one clic, now <strong>one can animate the entire limb just
by modifying the position of the hand or the foot</strong>!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1137735/files/20150108013905-bones.gif?1420709945"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Bones</em><strong> are layers which replace puppet pins</strong>
in After Effects. Created in a single click, they can be parented and
be controlled by IK’s. One can reproduce the exact same methods
like for the rigging of characters in 3D, but in After Effects. The
puppet acts like skinning, and Duik fills out the setup!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1137736/files/20150108013925-autorig.gif?1420709965"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Most of the characters are alike… Arms, Legs, Head… To avoid
repeating the same work again and again, <strong>Duik’s</strong><em>
Autorig</em><strong> can automatically rig a biped character!</strong>
You only have to move the anchor points to the appropriate joints (or
create bones if you use a puppet) and the <em>Autorig</em> does the
job: controllers, parenting, IK’s, expressions…<br/>And because
anyone is unique,<strong> the </strong><em>Autorig</em><strong>
adapts to your character</strong>: wether it has only one arm, or
it’s legs don’t have knees, it doesn’t matter, the rig is
automaticaly adapted.</p>

<p>When a limb bends, you may have to draw folds on the cloth, or a
muscle flex, or to adjust the shape of the elbow… <em><b>Rotation
Morph</b></em> was made to easily control how a property changes
(shape, time remap…) when a reference layer rotates.</p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1161624/files/20150120033934-rotmorph2.gif?1421753973"" src="""" style=""""/></p>A new

<p>It’s one thing to have well rigged characters, now you have to
animate them easily! <strong>Duik brings all kinds of animation
controllers</strong>, from the powerful <em><b>Spring</b></em>, which
automates delays and bounces of an object, to the <em><b>Wheel</b></em>,
which automates the rotation of the layer while it translates.<br/>Among
those tools, now you can <strong>copy/paste an animation</strong>
from several layers at once very easily, into the same composition to
repeat the animation, or from a composition to another to reuse
it.<br/>There is also a <strong>very simple interface to manage
interpolations</strong> to animate very easily without manipulating
curves.</p>

<p>Duik is a very useful tool for After Effects, and we think it
should be available for everyone. Thus, <b>Duik</b> <b>is a free
software and it will not ever be sold, for any price, to anyone. It
is and should always be free</b> - see the <a href=""http://www.fsf.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Free Software Foundation</a> for a complete explanation of what it means
being a free software - Duik is released under the <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GNU-GPL v3</a>, its source code is available on <a href=""http://github.com/Duduf-dev"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Github</a>.<br/></p>
<p>But developping this kind of tool, supporting it, making
tutorials, maintaining the website take a lot of time, and cost
money, which must be found, one way or another.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding now seems the best way to continue the quick

 private webpage will be available as soon as the campaign will end 
(2015-02-17) for all those who contributed 25€ and more. On this page, 
you will be able to download test versions of Duik as well as examples projects 
and expressions created for new tools and not yet implemented in Duik, as soon as they are developped.We can't say yet exactly when each feature will be finished and available; developping can be a long process with lots of surprises.Anyway, the real work  work will begin just after the end of the campaign, in the end of February.A release candidate version of Duik 15 should be available by the end of April, after a bunch of alpha and beta versions.Duik 15 may be available before this summer, if everything goes well, along with its documentation and libDuik.- 2D Camera animation tool,  to create controllers to
automatically move backgrounds and overlays, faking a camera without
the need of 3D Layers.- 3-layer IK- Randomizer- Blink animation- Paint animation- Move away toolAll of those are already working and will be available as test packages on the private page for indiegogo funders.- Developping libDuik, which will be used by Duik 15 itself- Implementing new animation tools (blink animation, paint animation and move away tool, randomizer)- Upgrading Duik User Interface
 to make it more user friendly and easier to understand and use, 
preparing the implementation of more complex tools as 3-layer IK and the
 new Autorig.- Upgrading IK Creation to make it easier, 
automatically detecting how the layers are parented and placed to get 
rid of the need to select the layers in the correct order.- Upgrading the Dialog window of the IK Creation, to make it easier to understand what are the options available and the type of IK to create.- Implementing 3-layer IK- Developping the new Autorig,
 improving the biped rig and adding quadrupeds rigs. There should be 
three main options when using the autorig: Bipeds (humans and other 
primates), Plantigrades quadrupeds (bears, mice, rabbits, primates...) 
and Digitigrades quadrupeds (dinosaurs, cats, dogs...)- Developping a complete translation tool, to make it easier to translate Duik in a lot of languages.Unfortunately, the autorig, one of the functions the most awaited, will 
be developped at the end only, its development needing the other tools 
to be available first.Anyway, quadrupeds rigs will be available to 
test earlier, a horse being one of the characters proposed to those who 
contributed more than 50€.Only when the development of Duik 15 will be finished, the complete user guide will be written, along with the developper's guide, but it shouldn't take long for it to be available.Then, the tutorials will be made, beginning by updating the already available ones to match Duik 15 updates.It seems we are going to raise the 4650 € initially needed, thanks to you all funders and sharers!Now, the campaign continues with new goals, to make Duik even better and easier to use.- Funded! Developping libDuik, a library (ExtendScript Object) to make it easy to include Duik in any other script for After Effects. This library will be released under a free software license (see the Free Software Foundation).This means anyone will be able to use Duik in any script. We just can't wait to see the autorigs and scripts YOU can do with this!- Funded! Writing the complete developper reference of Duik and libDuik. Just to make it even easier to use, including tips and tricks to give you anything you need to extend Duik to the infinity and beyond.- Funded! Dubbing the tutorials should make them easier to understand for all non-French speakers who currently have only English subtitles.- Funded! Duik already includes several languages, but all translations are not completed yet. We could finish those, especially German and Spanish, the two languages the most spoken by Duik users after English and French.- 7500 € and more: All tutorials made with the initial funding will be about the functions of Duik, explaining each one, to help users to know everything they can do with the script. Advanced tutorials would show how to use Duik on complex rigs, how to use it with other scripts and plugins...Examples: How to rig a foot with toes, Face rigging, Hand rigging, Animating a walk cycle, Tips and Tricks about camera animation, Writing complex expressions, Developping with ExtendScript...
It brings some
common tools and techniques used in 3D Softwares (like Maya, 3DS
Max...) to After Effects and 2D animation, which really lacked those
features. 

The need of those tools is proven by the worldwide use of
Duik, which has been downloaded about 200,000 times since its
first release in 2009. (see the gallery  for some examples of what can be done with Duik).
Above all, Duik is completely free, and will stay free,
for any purpose. You can download it, use it, share it, modify it, as
much as you want!And this won’t change! Even being a
great success, Duik won’t be sold. Let’s share techniques and
knowledge!
It has been developped by NicolasDufresne, a French director and animator who needed those tools
and decided to share them freely once developped.
Duik is in its 14th version, which was released a year ago.

Duik brings the easy Inverse Kinematics (IK) to After
Effects.IK is about being able to rig and animate a character
a lot more naturally.For example let's say you had to animate
an arm sway. Normally in After Effects you would separate the arm
into bones (arm, forearm and hand). Once you had parented all the
bones you would then have to animate each part separately - that's
what is called Forward Kinematics (FK). But, whatever
you keyed on the shoulder (rotation, scale or position), would have
an effect on the forearm and hand (rotation, scale, position). It was
always a balancing act. At the end of animating an arm, you would end
up with a mass of key frames, each individually affecting the limbs
(bones). This would make tweaking and adjusting the animation a
bleedin’ nightmare.With IK you have one controller.
Through the arm you place bones which, like before, you create a
parenting system (Hand to forearm, forearm to arm). You then hit this
magic button which creates a fully possible arm. The unique thing
about this, is you only animate the controller. This means less key
frames and less fuss. Unlike before you can now tweak and reanimate
with ease.
This tool is essential in many cases – to animate a character,
especially for a walk, a run; to animate mechanical processes of any
kind, etc. – inverse kinematics implied the use of very complex
trigonometrical expressions in After Effects (see DanEbberts‘s expressions).Duik automates this creation process
to allow the animator to focus on the animation! A simple controller
at the end of an arm, of a leg, or on the shoulders, an IK that was
created in one clic, now one can animate the entire limb just
by modifying the position of the hand or the foot!

Bones are layers which replace puppet pins
in After Effects. Created in a single click, they can be parented and
be controlled by IK’s. One can reproduce the exact same methods
like for the rigging of characters in 3D, but in After Effects. The
puppet acts like skinning, and Duik fills out the setup!

Most of the characters are alike… Arms, Legs, Head… To avoid
repeating the same work again and again, Duik’s
Autorig can automatically rig a biped character!
You only have to move the anchor points to the appropriate joints (or
create bones if you use a puppet) and the Autorig does the
job: controllers, parenting, IK’s, expressions…And because
anyone is unique, the Autorig
adapts to your character: wether it has only one arm, or
it’s legs don’t have knees, it doesn’t matter, the rig is
automaticaly adapted.

When a limb bends, you may have to draw folds on the cloth, or a
muscle flex, or to adjust the shape of the elbow… Rotation
Morph was made to easily control how a property changes
(shape, time remap…) when a reference layer rotates.A new
tutorial will be made very soon to show you how to use this powerful
tool.

It’s one thing to have well rigged characters, now you have to
animate them easily! Duik brings all kinds of animation
controllers, from the powerful Spring, which
automates delays and bounces of an object, to the Wheel,
which automates the rotation of the layer while it translates.Among
those tools, now you can copy/paste an animation
from several layers at once very easily, into the same composition to
repeat the animation, or from a composition to another to reuse
it.There is also a very simple interface to manage
interpolations to animate very easily without manipulating
curves.

• New IK for 3+1 LayerUntil now, an IK could only be created on two layers (for
example, the upper arm and the forearm, or the thigh and the calf),
with a possibility to add a Goal to the limb (the last part :
the hand or the foot).There will now be a way to create an IK
on three layers, while keeping the possibility to add a goal to
the limb. This can be very useful to human limbs: adding an extra
layer in the elbows or the knees can help a better bending. And
obviously, this can enable more animal or mechanic rigs.• A better AutorigThe autorig will be able to rig more complex legs, including feet
and toes joints, for more natural and realistic movements of the
feet.The torso, neck and head will have a better rigging,
easier to animate.There will be more options to make the
autorig more versatile, being able not only to rig bipeds but animals
and quadrupeds too.• New animation tools• List controller, to be able to mix different
animations and expressions on one property.
• Move Away tool which can move away a layer from
another.
• Animate Paint, to easily animate paint strokes
made in After Effects.
• Blink, to easily create a blinking property.
• Randomizer, to randomize transformations, in
points and out points of layers.
• 2D Camera, to create controllers to
automatically move backgrounds and overlays, faking a camera without
the need of 3D Layers.
• Translation tool
A very simple app will be available to enable users to add or
update their own translations of Duik, in any language. Those
translations could then be included in future updates of Duik!
• Easier to use
Some enhancements to the interface, and including help inside Duik
will make it even easier to use, and easier to understand each tool.• A complete documentation & tutorials
Why release a powerful tool if people do not know how to use it?
Duik 15 will be released with a full user reference, and tutorials
will be made for each tool (some are already available on Duduf Training).
Duik is a very useful tool for After Effects, and we think it
should be available for everyone. Thus, Duik is a free
software and it will not ever be sold, for any price, to anyone. It
is and should always be free - see the Free Software Foundation for a complete explanation of what it means
being a free software - Duik is released under the GNU-GPL v3, its source code is available on Github.
But developping this kind of tool, supporting it, making
tutorials, maintaining the website take a lot of time, and cost
money, which must be found, one way or another.
Crowdfunding now seems the best way to continue the quick
development of Duik while keeping it free for everyone.

While donations are like paying for an existing tool,
crowdfunding is bringing together a lot of enthusiast users to bring
Duik to its next level, while keeping it free.
What will be done with the funds?

If the 4650 € crowd-funding goal is reached:•
	Duik 15 Release (development of new tools, updating the
	website, writing a complete user reference)•
	One tutorial for each feature of Duik (some are already
	available on Duduf
	Training)• 4% (186 €) go to Indiegogo


If more than 5000 € are raised, some of these could be done:• More tutorials about advanced techniques (how to rig a foot with toes, how to rig digitigrades...)• More translations of Duik (German, Spanish...)• English dubbing of the tutorials• Writing a developper reference• Creating a library to make it easy to use Duik in other scripts...
If the goal of 4650 € is not reached:• Indiegogo will keep 9% instead of 4%• Priority will be givent to the developement of Duik, but the tutorials, documentation could be delayed or even canceled.

<h3>A Fresh Start</h3>
<p>Fresh grew from our love for each other and our passion for healthy living.  To share our passion for healthy food with our family and friends, we bottled Jason's pineapple hot sauce to share with everyone at our wedding.  With overwhelming support from all who received a bottle that day, we decided to officially start Fresh.</p>
<p>In 2011, Fresh rented space in a commercial kitchen (commissary) in downtown Jacksonville.  Partnering with a local print shop and other local vendors, Fresh has focused on suppporting local businesses from the start.</p>
<p>In 2012, Riverside Arts Market (every Saturday in downtown Jacksonville) became the central hub for sharing Fresh with the community.  Their love of Fresh shaped the expansion of the Fresh line to include mustards, trail mixes, gourmet spice blends, breads, and gluten free cookies.</p>
<p>In 2013, as more people discover Fresh, new products are continually brought to life.  Through continued involvement with the Riverside Arts Market and other local events, the community's love of Fresh cannot be contained within just one day per week.  Fresh needs to expand!  Fresh won 8th place overall in the inaugural One Spark crowdfunding event, beating out 450 other start-up businesses as the crowd favorite.  By the end of the year, armed with our recently earned MBAs from University of North Florida, Fresh will expand to a new commercial location to help the community live The Fresh Life!</p>

Our goal to raise $10,000 from this campaign will buy a new commercial oven for the Fresh expansion.  If donors like you are gracious enough to exceed our goal, this will help to buy commercial grade blenders, dehydrators, food processors, and mixers.  Your help will go a long way to helping people live a happier healthier lifestyle.


A Fresh Start
Fresh grew from our love for each other and our passion for healthy living.  To share our passion for healthy food with our family and friends, we bottled Jason's pineapple hot sauce to share with everyone at our wedding.  With overwhelming support from all who received a bottle that day, we decided to officially start Fresh.
In 2011, Fresh rented space in a commercial kitchen (commissary) in downtown Jacksonville.  Partnering with a local print shop and other local vendors, Fresh has focused on suppporting local businesses from the start.
In 2012, Riverside Arts Market (every Saturday in downtown Jacksonville) became the central hub for sharing Fresh with the community.  Their love of Fresh shaped the expansion of the Fresh line to include mustards, trail mixes, gourmet spice blends, breads, and gluten free cookies.
In 2013, as more people discover Fresh, new products are continually brought to life.  Through continued involvement with the Riverside Arts Market and other local events, the community's love of Fresh cannot be contained within just one day per week.  Fresh needs to expand!  Fresh won 8th place overall in the inaugural One Spark crowdfunding event, beating out 450 other start-up businesses as the crowd favorite.  By the end of the year, armed with our recently earned MBAs from University of North Florida, Fresh will expand to a new commercial location to help the community live The Fresh Life!



A Fresh Future
With a refreshing take on fitness, the Fresh Fitness studio will freature a relaxed atmosphere for yoga, group fitness classes, and personal training.  Fresh Fitness is for everyone from couch potatoes to athletes.  The studio will feature tranquil yoga, high intensity interval training, beginner circuit training, and other classes with a focus on individual goals.  Fresh Fitness together with Fresh Foods creates a place to nurture your healthy lifestyle.
Whether it's a quick lunch for you, dinner for the entire family, or a full week's worth of meals to fill your fridge, Fresh has you covered.  Our healthy prepared meals to-go are ready and waiting for you, because we know your time is very valuable.  Fresh is your healthy fast-food resource for people on the go.  Featuring eco-friendly packaging options, you can feel good about the choices you make at Fresh.
On the weekends, tables and chairs will fill the studio and the farm-to-table dinner party will begin.  With an ever-changing seasonally inspired menu featuring the freshest local produce, Fresh is the place to be.  Celebrate the Fresh lifestyle with three or more courses including delectable desserts and a selection of organic beer & wine.

While we specialize in healthy delicious foods, we also pride ourselves in offering allergy-free foods.  In order to help support your healthier lifestyle, our entire facility will always be free from dairy, eggs, and peanuts.  We will also offer many gluten-free products, created in a separate preparation area and dedicated gluten-free oven.
Live The Fresh Life and make a difference in your life and the lives of others.  At Fresh, we understand the importance of sharing our good fortune with others.  We have always, and will always donate a portion of our porfits to causes that are close to our heart.

About 2 months ago, I began fainting without cause. Along with these spells, I began throwing up, feeling dizzy, couldn't stand for long with weakness in legs, seizing during and after, slowness of speech, and memory loss. Just yesterday, I fainted 6 times in a row and when I woke up, had no idea where I was and barely recognized my own husband. I didn't know my apartment or even my pets. For 30 minutes, I struggled to remember who I was and what made up ""me."" I have been to the hospital 5 times - 4 times being in the emergency room and 1 time admitted. I've been to multiple doctor's visits including GP, cardiologist, and neurologist. I have even spent my first time in an ambulance this past December. I have more doctor's visits in my future, and frankly, I am terrified. During these episodes, I have stopped breathing and have needed CPR to start again. With all of this stress, confusion, and sadness came another factor - finances. The ambulance ride, hospital visits, and doctor's visit bills have all started pouring in with no indication of stopping soon. At this point in time, my new husband, Jesse, and I need help. We are asking for all those who love us, or even don't, to please consider aiding us in our time of need. We have 4 animals, rent to pay, and cannot do this on our own. We thank you and appreciate your support in helping us find a cure for me, and also for helping us when I needed oxygen, medicine, and to live. In return, we promise to keep you updated with my status and let you know what we discover - together. Thank you again for your help and may you be blessed for it!</p></div>","Hello,     My name is Vonabell Hurst and I am a recently married 20 year old woman with an unknown sickness over taking my body.

<p>Jan 2013 Lisa Mawdsley, a wonderful mother, wife and great friend to so many announced they were expecting their second child. The next few months were extremely exciting for their young family looking forward to finding out the sex of the baby. When they went in for the ultrasound at 20 weeks their excitement quickly turned to fear as they learned that their baby girl had a tumor on her spine that would make this a very risky pregnancy.  Over the course of the next 4 months Lisa had to be closely monitored by specialists while still caring for her young daughter Alyssa. Bailey Elizabeth was born on July 5<sup>th</sup> which involved an extremely complex c-section in order to not disrupt the tumor which weighed in at one pound. The very next morning Bailey endured a four hour surgery to remove the large tumor and a portion of her tailbone. She was living off of a breathing tube and feeding tube until she was able to learn to breath and eat on her own. Lisa and her husband Tim spent their 13<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary in the hospital and got the gift of seeing her first smile that day but were still not able to hold their new daughter. Bailey was 5 days old before she felt the warmth and comfort of her mom and dad holding her. They were finally released to take her home on July 16<sup>th</sup> where mom and baby are still recovering.  </p>
<p>Lisa was the definition of strength and positivity during one of the scariest things she will ever experience.  Most get to take their baby home and enjoy watching them grow with few worries while Lisa is just thankful that her baby survived. She came home to medical bills that are piling up from the specialists and Bailey’s surgery and extended hospital stay.</p>
<p>I know word can spread like fire on Facebook so let’s get it out there! Even 5,000 people contributing $1.00 can help us reach our goal of $5,000 in 30 days. If you can't contribute you can still be a huge help by spreading the word by simply clicking the link above.</p>
<p>Please know that all funds will go to Lisa and her family to help cover medical bills and expenses for Bailey. Lisa has been limited to working part time as she was being closely monitored by specialists in Iowa City, two hours from home, for months and is now recovering with complications from the C-Section. Even the smallest contribution will go a long way and would mean so much to the Mawdsley family.</p>

<h3>Convenience</h3>
<p>After being originally developed for Janie after having our baby, we quickly found that Yoga Flexer was the solution for many busy lifestyles. Whether it's work, travel, school or an injury.

<h3>Handle Connection With Weights  </h3>
<p>Connect the handles to replicate dumbbell like motions. Add 2lb weights in each handle to increase intensity during resistance training.

<p><strong>OUR STORY </strong> </p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, a lot has changed in our lives. We went from being in college, working out every day, to not working out at all. After having our son, working out was just an afterthought for the two of us. It was difficult to find a balance between work, graduate school, traveling to see family and finding energy.</p>
<p>Janie, was a Division I track athlete at Northern Iowa. On top of that, she was finishing her graduate degree in Speech-Language Pathology. The adjustment to parenting impacted her the most, as leaving our little one to workout at the gym was not going to make it on her to-do list. That’s when we began developing the Yoga Flexer System! -- Anthony and Janie Kokakis</p>
