<p>Battling polar storms with temperatures down to minus 60 deg centigrade and dodging hunting polar bears, the team skied for over three weeks across the frozen Arctic Ocean to reach the 1996 Magnetic North Pole. This remarkable location marks the point of confluence of the Earth’s magnetic field out on the pack ice of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Baboon Outdoors have always done environmental stewardships and humanitarian projects in order to #DiversifyTheOutdoors. Because we are a for-profit start-up business, we've had extreme difficulties getting grants and funding our projects. A lot of the efforts have come from our own pocket and time, but this isn't sustainable. So, we want to start a non-profit!</p>
<p>This crowdfunding campaign contributes to future aid to protect our nature and our sport. This will be a turning point in helping our community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funds to register for the official 501(c)3 non-profit.  Becoming a 501(c)3 non-profit will allow us to make every donation tax deductible, including this fundraiser! We also want to register for the higher-prestigious 501(c)3 application because that'll give us more merit when it comes to applying for grants.</p>
<p>Helping us with this campaign will get you some awesome perks!</p>
<ul>
<li>First, all of your donation will become tax-deductible!</li>
<li>You can join us for a private tour on climbing areas that we are developing</li>
<li>Send you a customized apparel that shows off your support for us.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign allows us to create a 501(c)3 that can leave a lasting impact for our future generations. We've already done some work, and we want to do more and make sure that work has a lasting impression.</p>
<ul>
<li>We've partnered with City of Riverside's Parks &amp; Recreation to allow rock climbing at Mt. Rubidoux.</li>
<li>Worked with the San Bernardino National Forest to help create and maintain trails.</li>
<li>We've done graffiti removal with the High Desert Climbers and TrailMothers to protect nature's beauty while preserving the friction on the rock climbing routes.</li>
<li>We are currently developing several climbing areas but we need financial help to make the development high quality.</li>
<li>We want to work with the Fish &amp; Wildlife to protecting several endangered species like the Delhi Sands flower-loving fly and the Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog.</li>
<li>We want to create grants that allow underserved communities a chance to experience the outdoors and get better at their sport of choice; ie. rock climbing or trail running.</li>
<li>And we want to do much more!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk we have to face is that we don't end up getting grants. This is a fear of ours but we don't want fear to hold us back any longer. That's why we want the more prestige application for 501(c)3 to give us a better chance. We also are looking for grant writers that can help us, and the position will have a competitive compensation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You may not able to help us financially but there are plenty of other ways.</p>

<div>Save Beeliar Wetlands is taking our campaign to the Supreme Court. We know that Roe 8/Perth Freight Link is bad policy and the wrong decision for Western Australia's future. Wetlands are fragile and delicate, and the Beeliar Wetlands can't recover from clearing 100ha - approx 1/4 of the total. There is no way that a freeway through a wetland can be anything other than an environmental disaster. <br/><br/>The community doesn't want this road and the cost is unacceptably high when there are better alternatives which haven't been considered. The safety of our community, our schools, our park and our homes are all under imminent threat by the Perth Freight Link. <br/>
</div>
<div>We need to raise funds to challenge the poor decision making about Roe 8 and the Perth Freight Link. We have the support of local councils and local members of parliament both at the State and Federal level. Thousands of supporters have joined us already and given their support, time and energy. Working together we can be a powerful voice for the community. We know that the government have more legal muscle and access to funds beyond our wildest dreams - but we have people power and support beyond their fathoming! <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>But we need your help! We need to raise at least $50,000, giving what you can will help us get there!<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>We are ordinary citizens doing extraordinary things, join us to help protect the environment, our local park, walkways, community amenity and the proper use of public money.<br/><br/>

<div>We urgently need you to donate to our legal fighting fund.</div>

<h3>What is the Save Beeliar Wetlands Campaign?</h3> <p>The Save Beeliar Wetlands campaign is all about local community. We appreciate the ecological value and beauty of the Beeliar Wetlands, a series of swamps, wetlands and lakes across the southern corridor of Perth forming part of the Beeliar Regional Park. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Local people have been involved in activity and community awareness to halt road building through this fragile environment for more than 30 years. Our campaign has grown so much in the last 2 years that it is hard to describe us. The campaign takes in all facets of the local community from the committee who meet every fortnight to the people who sit on stalls, organise fundraisers, write to the papers, take photos, play music, make soup, put up signs and contribute by making a noise and remind the government that not only do we not wan the road but we think that planning in flawed! we are passionate about our wetlands, we have been campaigning relentlessly, we are willing to put in huge effort to stop this Road to Nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">More than anything though we are local people who want to stop the </span>government building 5.5km of highway through a wetland. The current system takes truck to the Leach highway, the proposal takes trucks to the Leach highway! We think that this is madness and want to hold the government to account for poor planning and environmental recklessness.</p>

</div><div> <p>We have an incredible team of volunteer lawyers and community members who are giving their time for this legal challenge but we need to meet their generosity by contributing funds to pay for the on going costs. While the team give their time we need to be able to pay for things like office space, research, electricity and administration costs, telephone, FOI requests and many more incidentals. The team have estimated that this will come to about $50,000. Without this money the campaign cannot continue.</p>
<p>This money will go directly to the legal challenge.</p>
<p>There will be no third parties accessing these funds.</p>

</div><div> <p>It is not difficult to imagine how much protecting this last remaining wetland could give our community- we enjoy it now and will do everything we can to avoid having it destroyed by an unnecessary freeway development. If we can win this we can secure a future nature space for generations of wildlife and people. Losing this precious wetlands and adjacent bushland will impact upon us all. <br/></p>
<p>The biggest impacts are:</p> <ul> <li>protecting Aboriginal and non Aboriginal culture and heritage<br/>
</li>
<li>protection of habitat for threatened species such as the Carnaby's Cockatoo, Graceful Sun Moth and Southern Bandicoot.</li> <li>continuity of the wetlands to ensure biodiversity and species survival of both animal and plant species.</li>
<li>keeping Bibra Lake and North Lake as spaces for our kids and community to enjoy</li>
<li>alerting the government to the need to listen to the people: they do not have a mandate to build this road</li>
<li>clean air</li>
<li>clean water</li>
<li>keep our homes and bush safe<br/>
</li> </ul>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are risks involved in the Save Beeliar Wetlands Campaign, we are putting our community organisation on the line by going to court however we believe that this is a risk that we can and should take for the good of all. Many people in the southern and western suburbs of Perth are relying on us to stop the Perth Freight Link at Roe 8. It is the best way of keeping the Government accountable and asking them to properly consider the development needs of the state, in particular the Kwinana Outer Harbour.</p>

</div></div>","Legal Challenge?



Save Beeliar Wetlands is taking our campaign to the Supreme Court. We know that Roe 8/Perth Freight Link is bad policy and the wrong decision for Western Australia's future. Wetlands are fragile and delicate, and the Beeliar Wetlands can't recover from clearing 100ha - approx 1/4 of the total. There is no way that a freeway through a wetland can be anything other than an environmental disaster. The community doesn't want this road and the cost is unacceptably high when there are better alternatives which haven't been considered. The safety of our community, our schools, our park and our homes are all under imminent threat by the Perth Freight Link. 

We need to raise funds to challenge the poor decision making about Roe 8 and the Perth Freight Link. We have the support of local councils and local members of parliament both at the State and Federal level. Thousands of supporters have joined us already and given their support, time and energy. Working together we can be a powerful voice for the community. We know that the government have more legal muscle and access to funds beyond our wildest dreams - but we have people power and support beyond their fathoming! 

But we need your help! We need to raise at least $50,000, giving what you can will help us get there!

We are ordinary citizens doing extraordinary things, join us to help protect the environment, our local park, walkways, community amenity and the proper use of public money.

We urgently need you to donate to our legal fighting fund.

What is the Save Beeliar Wetlands Campaign? The Save Beeliar Wetlands campaign is all about local community. We appreciate the ecological value and beauty of the Beeliar Wetlands, a series of swamps, wetlands and lakes across the southern corridor of Perth forming part of the Beeliar Regional Park. Local people have been involved in activity and community awareness to halt road building through this fragile environment for more than 30 years. Our campaign has grown so much in the last 2 years that it is hard to describe us. The campaign takes in all facets of the local community from the committee who meet every fortnight to the people who sit on stalls, organise fundraisers, write to the papers, take photos, play music, make soup, put up signs and contribute by making a noise and remind the government that not only do we not wan the road but we think that planning in flawed! we are passionate about our wetlands, we have been campaigning relentlessly, we are willing to put in huge effort to stop this Road to Nowhere.
More than anything though we are local people who want to stop the government building 5.5km of highway through a wetland. The current system takes truck to the Leach highway, the proposal takes trucks to the Leach highway! We think that this is madness and want to hold the government to account for poor planning and environmental recklessness.
Images from our recent rally 



What We Need & What You Get
 We have an incredible team of volunteer lawyers and community members who are giving their time for this legal challenge but we need to meet their generosity by contributing funds to pay for the on going costs. While the team give their time we need to be able to pay for things like office space, research, electricity and administration costs, telephone, FOI requests and many more incidentals. The team have estimated that this will come to about $50,000. Without this money the campaign cannot continue.
This money will go directly to the legal challenge.
There will be no third parties accessing these funds.



The Impact
 It is not difficult to imagine how much protecting this last remaining wetland could give our community- we enjoy it now and will do everything we can to avoid having it destroyed by an unnecessary freeway development. If we can win this we can secure a future nature space for generations of wildlife and people. Losing this precious wetlands and adjacent bushland will impact upon us all. 
The biggest impacts are:  protecting Aboriginal and non Aboriginal culture and heritage

protection of habitat for threatened species such as the Carnaby's Cockatoo, Graceful Sun Moth and Southern Bandicoot. continuity of the wetlands to ensure biodiversity and species survival of both animal and plant species.
keeping Bibra Lake and North Lake as spaces for our kids and community to enjoy
alerting the government to the need to listen to the people: they do not have a mandate to build this road
clean air
clean water
keep our homes and bush safe
 



   Risks & Challenges There are risks involved in the Save Beeliar Wetlands Campaign, we are putting our community organisation on the line by going to court however we believe that this is a risk that we can and should take for the good of all. Many people in the southern and western suburbs of Perth are relying on us to stop the Perth Freight Link at Roe 8. It is the best way of keeping the Government accountable and asking them to properly consider the development needs of the state, in particular the Kwinana Outer Harbour.

<h3>The Issue</h3>
<p>As human population continues to grow there is an increasing loss of natural habitats as human settlements invade the wilderness areas forcing wildlife to congregate in smaller ones and the human-wildlife conflict increases. Additionally the sudden rise of economies in South East Asia has caused a great demand for perceived luxury goods such as Ivory ornaments, wild animal artifacts (Lion bones, pangolin scales, gorilla hands) and alternative medicines (rhino horns) which has fuelled the illegal wildlife trade.</p>
<p>The loss of habitat, the increase of human-wildlife conflict and the growing wildlife trade are the major threats facing Africa's iconic wildlife species.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's estimated that an elephant is shot for ivory every 15 minutes</li>
<li>Lions now only occupy 8% of their historic natural range and overall population has decreased by 43%. </li>
<li>Mountain Gorillas are classified as critically endangered with an approximate total population less than 1000 individuals. </li>
</ul>
<p>New reports have recently shocked the scientific communities with the extent of the loss of giraffes and cheetahs throughout Africa.</p>
<p>These headlines are becoming much too frequent and the future is ominous for African wildlife if current trends don't change.</p>
<p><strong>We believe there is hope for a brighter future for Africa's wildlife but we need to make a change now in whichever way possible. Africa Conservation Adventure is our way to make this change.</strong></p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483340314/t29b4khwgy4acuyeadb2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are Andrea Pompele and Rebecca Phillips and together we created <strong>Africa </strong><strong>Conservation Adventure</strong>. Andrea has an advanced academic background in biology and wildlife behavior studies as well as being a fully trained safari guide. Whilst Rebecca has a lifetime of experience of living in the African bush. We are passionate about African wilderness and its wildlife and we take our roles as conservation ambassadors very seriously. <strong>Africa Conservation Adventure</strong> combines conservation awareness, educational pursuits and photographic projects, aiming to promote key species conservation by building international awareness around ivory trade, lion’s protection and other local-level conservation projects across the African Continent</p>
<h3><strong>What we want</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483012795/upzyqhmdicyktktq0b8k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We want to ignite another global movement towards conserving Africa's iconic wildlife. By collaborating with various organisations working directly IN THE FIELD to protect wildlife and raising awareness we make a change. Some of the organisations we work with are PAMS Foundation, Virunga National Park, WildAid East Africa and many others. We will make short interviews and videos of them to share on the social media. Social Media is powerful tool for reaching a wide international audience and we want to make the most of this. We will also use photos we will take from the expedition for releasing a limited edition photo-book. Sales from the photo book will provide further funding for the organisations we partner with and their work.</p>
<p>We will collect informations, highlight human-wildlife conflicts issues, poaching crisis and seek to understand more about the major challenges and difficulties these organisations are facing every day. These dedicated conservationists are the ones that work hard and risk their lives to protect the African wilderness. Without them the future is bleak so we want to underline the importance of these organisations and their essential work. Community involvement, education, and direct financial benefits are needed. </p>
<p><strong>We want to give them something back</strong> by broadcasting their importance and hard work to a larger public and finding opportunities to make their work more sustainable and expanding their direct impact.</p>
<h3><strong>How</strong></h3>
<p>The funds we will raise will go directly into conservation: such as paying park fees and permits (an important source of income for the national parks to continue to protect and conserve ecosystems). We will also manage conservation initiatives together with the organisations we will visit, supporting them with funding to help them directly and also by spreading their work in social media and through our photos released in a photo book.</p>
<p>Sales from the photobook will help them concretely: all the profits from the publication of the book will go directly to sustain their field work and help them day by day to carry on. </p>
<h3><strong>Why</strong></h3>
<p>Losing iconic African species such as Elephants, Lions and Gorillas will not just be a major loss and disruption to natural habitats but also a big loss to humanity as they are part of our heritage  - so this something that affects us all!</p>
<p><i>We believe in education and development and we think that sharing accurate information is a powerful tool to change the world.</i></p>
<p>Everybody can do something important and help make a change they want to see, a small action can lead to a powerful impact. The magnitude of your contribution will help our conservation project to take off the ground and help protect wildlife concretely and directly.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This project is estimated and budgeted to an amount of $15,000 where we will cover any other non-budgeted costs privately. Besides supporting conservation initiatives we need funds to cover the costs of travelling, photographing, filming and editing.</p>
<p>The money will be divided to cover;</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:36pt;"">Travelling costs such as fuel and visas,</li>
<li style=""margin-left:36pt;"">Money directly put in conservation: Permits, Park fees,</li>
<li style=""margin-left:36pt;"">Conservation initiatives directly managed by us </li>
<li style=""margin-left:36pt;"">Production costs of editing and printing the photobook</li>
<li style=""margin-left:36pt;"">Accommodation</li>
<li style=""margin-left:36pt;"">Additional equipment required after our previous trip such as vehicle spares, solar lights, waterproofing for our cameras etc. </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Photobook</h3>
<p>Composed of a combination of both of our top wildlife and landscape photographs from the trip. These are all taken with a professional photographic approach (of course we are wildlife photographers) and our own personal photographic styles evident throughout the book. Top quality materials will be used to do our pictures justice and to guarantee quality. </p>

<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Our perks are designed to make you happy, they are personal, direct, unique and of course ethical! The greatest perk for anyone who contributes at any amount is the knowledge and assurance that you will be informing the world about the real dangers wildlife are facing and supporting solutions to save them from extinction in the wild.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To clarify: we don’t have a definitive solution to save the wildlife, but we can act to do something and sustain the projects that are making a difference. Wildlife is a human heritage and we are responsible for them!</p>

<h3>Our previous expedition</h3>
<p><strong>Africa Conservation Adventure</strong> was created a year ago and we did our first expedition in March and April 2016 as a means of contributing to the cause of ending wildlife crime.</p>
<p>We released a photo-book showcasing the fascinating natural reserves and the abundant wildlife we encountered throughout our expedition in Southern Africa going through Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. Along our journey we met with members of PAMS Foundation, Lilongwe Wildlife Trust and Game Rangers International and heard about the different challenges they faced in fighting wildlife crime in their respective countries. It became clear to us that fighting against wildlife crime requires an international network and cooperation that exceeds the geographical borders. We learnt that education and information shared on an International level is a key factor in turning the tide on wildlife crime and that is what we are striving to do.</p>
<p>Our last expedition was a success and a start of something bigger which now we would like to make it even better. We can't stop exploring and acting for conservation, it's our mission. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i>Risks for us </i></p>
<p>We are going to travel during the rainy season from end of March till the end of May 2017 which can cause difficult driving conditions. We will camp in a basic tent in savannahs, tropical forests and mountain areas. <br/>Hiking and tracking Gorillas, Chimpanzees and visiting Volcanoes (in Virunga) above 3000 m altitude through thick rainforest during the rains will provide challenging.  When it decides to rain in East Africa it seriously pours! But if there is no challenge, then where is the fun?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:21.3pt;""><strong>Don’t worry we will travel safe, we are used to the wilderness. We have a plan... And it’s a good one!</strong></p>
<p><i>Risks for Conservation </i></p>
<p>This is a flexible campaign meaning that we will go ahead with our trip even if we don't reach full amount. However if our target funding is not achieved this will bring less money to conservation, limit the awareness we can raise and reduce the length and duration of the expedition – more money gained is more money supporting the real action against threats of wildlife. </p>

</div></div>","The Issue
As human population continues to grow there is an increasing loss of natural habitats as human settlements invade the wilderness areas forcing wildlife to congregate in smaller ones and the human-wildlife conflict increases. Additionally the sudden rise of economies in South East Asia has caused a great demand for perceived luxury goods such as Ivory ornaments, wild animal artifacts (Lion bones, pangolin scales, gorilla hands) and alternative medicines (rhino horns) which has fuelled the illegal wildlife trade.
The loss of habitat, the increase of human-wildlife conflict and the growing wildlife trade are the major threats facing Africa's iconic wildlife species.

It's estimated that an elephant is shot for ivory every 15 minutes
Lions now only occupy 8% of their historic natural range and overall population has decreased by 43%. 
Mountain Gorillas are classified as critically endangered with an approximate total population less than 1000 individuals. 

New reports have recently shocked the scientific communities with the extent of the loss of giraffes and cheetahs throughout Africa.
These headlines are becoming much too frequent and the future is ominous for African wildlife if current trends don't change.
We believe there is hope for a brighter future for Africa's wildlife but we need to make a change now in whichever way possible. Africa Conservation Adventure is our way to make this change.
The Team

We are Andrea Pompele and Rebecca Phillips and together we created Africa Conservation Adventure. Andrea has an advanced academic background in biology and wildlife behavior studies as well as being a fully trained safari guide. Whilst Rebecca has a lifetime of experience of living in the African bush. We are passionate about African wilderness and its wildlife and we take our roles as conservation ambassadors very seriously. Africa Conservation Adventure combines conservation awareness, educational pursuits and photographic projects, aiming to promote key species conservation by building international awareness around ivory trade, lion’s protection and other local-level conservation projects across the African Continent
What we want

We want to ignite another global movement towards conserving Africa's iconic wildlife. By collaborating with various organisations working directly IN THE FIELD to protect wildlife and raising awareness we make a change. Some of the organisations we work with are PAMS Foundation, Virunga National Park, WildAid East Africa and many others. We will make short interviews and videos of them to share on the social media. Social Media is powerful tool for reaching a wide international audience and we want to make the most of this. We will also use photos we will take from the expedition for releasing a limited edition photo-book. Sales from the photo book will provide further funding for the organisations we partner with and their work.
We will collect informations, highlight human-wildlife conflicts issues, poaching crisis and seek to understand more about the major challenges and difficulties these organisations are facing every day. These dedicated conservationists are the ones that work hard and risk their lives to protect the African wilderness. Without them the future is bleak so we want to underline the importance of these organisations and their essential work. Community involvement, education, and direct financial benefits are needed. 
We want to give them something back by broadcasting their importance and hard work to a larger public and finding opportunities to make their work more sustainable and expanding their direct impact.
How
The funds we will raise will go directly into conservation: such as paying park fees and permits (an important source of income for the national parks to continue to protect and conserve ecosystems). We will also manage conservation initiatives together with the organisations we will visit, supporting them with funding to help them directly and also by spreading their work in social media and through our photos released in a photo book.
Sales from the photobook will help them concretely: all the profits from the publication of the book will go directly to sustain their field work and help them day by day to carry on. 
Why
Losing iconic African species such as Elephants, Lions and Gorillas will not just be a major loss and disruption to natural habitats but also a big loss to humanity as they are part of our heritage  - so this something that affects us all!
We believe in education and development and we think that sharing accurate information is a powerful tool to change the world.
Everybody can do something important and help make a change they want to see, a small action can lead to a powerful impact. The magnitude of your contribution will help our conservation project to take off the ground and help protect wildlife concretely and directly.
 
What We Need & What You Get
This project is estimated and budgeted to an amount of $15,000 where we will cover any other non-budgeted costs privately. Besides supporting conservation initiatives we need funds to cover the costs of travelling, photographing, filming and editing.
The money will be divided to cover;

Travelling costs such as fuel and visas,
Money directly put in conservation: Permits, Park fees,
Conservation initiatives directly managed by us 
Production costs of editing and printing the photobook
Accommodation
Additional equipment required after our previous trip such as vehicle spares, solar lights, waterproofing for our cameras etc. 

The Photobook
Composed of a combination of both of our top wildlife and landscape photographs from the trip. These are all taken with a professional photographic approach (of course we are wildlife photographers) and our own personal photographic styles evident throughout the book. Top quality materials will be used to do our pictures justice and to guarantee quality. 
Example extract from our previous book: 



The Perks
Our perks are designed to make you happy, they are personal, direct, unique and of course ethical! The greatest perk for anyone who contributes at any amount is the knowledge and assurance that you will be informing the world about the real dangers wildlife are facing and supporting solutions to save them from extinction in the wild.
The Impact
To clarify: we don’t have a definitive solution to save the wildlife, but we can act to do something and sustain the projects that are making a difference. Wildlife is a human heritage and we are responsible for them!

The more funds we can raise the more we will be able to do for sustainable conservation which will have a bigger impact on our end goal. Everybody can make an impact and be a part of making the changes our planet needs!
Whether or not you support our expedition is up to you. If you do, it's something you do for protecting wildlife. Not for anyone else. Not for us but for them . We are proud of you!
Every dollar we raise for this campaign is not just money, it is a vote of confidence, you will help a small conservation project get off the ground and help in an practical way to protect wildlife.
Thank you for all your support we are looking forward to starting the adventure and being part of a long term impact on creating a better and more sustainable world.

Our previous expedition
Africa Conservation Adventure was created a year ago and we did our first expedition in March and April 2016 as a means of contributing to the cause of ending wildlife crime.
We released a photo-book showcasing the fascinating natural reserves and the abundant wildlife we encountered throughout our expedition in Southern Africa going through Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. Along our journey we met with members of PAMS Foundation, Lilongwe Wildlife Trust and Game Rangers International and heard about the different challenges they faced in fighting wildlife crime in their respective countries. It became clear to us that fighting against wildlife crime requires an international network and cooperation that exceeds the geographical borders. We learnt that education and information shared on an International level is a key factor in turning the tide on wildlife crime and that is what we are striving to do.
Our last expedition was a success and a start of something bigger which now we would like to make it even better. We can't stop exploring and acting for conservation, it's our mission.

Risks & Challenges
Risks for us 
We are going to travel during the rainy season from end of March till the end of May 2017 which can cause difficult driving conditions. We will camp in a basic tent in savannahs, tropical forests and mountain areas. Hiking and tracking Gorillas, Chimpanzees and visiting Volcanoes (in Virunga) above 3000 m altitude through thick rainforest during the rains will provide challenging.  When it decides to rain in East Africa it seriously pours! But if there is no challenge, then where is the fun?
Don’t worry we will travel safe, we are used to the wilderness. We have a plan... And it’s a good one!
Risks for Conservation 
This is a flexible campaign meaning that we will go ahead with our trip even if we don't reach full amount. However if our target funding is not achieved this will bring less money to conservation, limit the awareness we can raise and reduce the length and duration of the expedition – more money gained is more money supporting the real action against threats of wildlife.

My name is Maddy and I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in primate conservation at Oxford Brookes University. My research focuses on conserving orangutans and as such I will be traveling to Indonesia for three months to conduct of a behavioral study on juveniles living together in captivity at a rehabilitation center.  I will be looking specifically at Bornean orangutans (</span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Pongo pygmaeus</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.)

With the expansion of the ever efficient oil palm plantations, we are losing habitat fast so these animals are arriving in rehab centers at a rapid pace. I believe that understanding species specific behavior and development is vital for successfully rehabilitating primates and reintroducing them back into the wild. Furthermore, I believe that rehab and reintroduction critical to the conservation of these animals. </span><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1345007/files/20150401020351-orang.jpg?1427879031"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">(Untitled by Madeline Thaler)</span></p><p>I have been working with primate rehabilitation for the last five years.

Though the ultimate goal is for these animals to be reintroduced into protected forests, they often spend their entire infancy or longer (5-10 years) in captivity where they learn how to be an orang-utan from humans and the many other orphaned orang-utans they are housed with. Orang-utans in captive environments like this have an increased opportunity for social interactions than they do in the wild. As such, they have been observed to engage in social play at greater rates. The role of play in mammalian development is still a greatly debated topic.  Play is often described as a ""luxury"" or ""opportunity"" behavior that will only be observed when the costs of play are low because all proximate needs are met or as a behavior critical for learning socially appropriate behaviors specific to living in large groups.  However, the overall functions and role in development of social play in orangutan development can be more difficult to understand given the relatively solitary habits of orangutans in the wild and there are many questions raised by this variation in rates of social play seen in captive orang-utans as opposed to wild ones.  <p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1345402/files/20150401051918-874687251_f2492514fb_o.jpg?1427890758"" src="""" style=""""/>(<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/helenbuckland/874687251/in/photolist-2ki13F-pszWWA-cChGcu-a34uJG-5T2zBk-7pyA8t-akWrPN-akWrRC-dPCs4d-8xP6YZ-nb8hS6-7oR539-rdth7J-5mfhoL-fSgpQL-dF5iZC-cChF6h-7pyGBH-dKxZsC-6CC3L2-5vkUoj-6LDENr-dv75aR-avZ9nh"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/helenbuckland/874687251/in/photolist-2ki13F-pszWWA-cChGcu-a34uJG-5T2zBk-7pyA8t-akWrPN-akWrRC-dPCs4d-8xP6YZ-nb8hS6-7oR539-rdth7J-5mfhoL-fSgpQL-dF5iZC-cChF6h-7pyGBH-dKxZsC-6CC3L2-5vkUoj-6LDENr-dv75aR-avZ9nh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mother and Infant </a>by Helen Buckland.

</div></div>","Hello! My name is Maddy and I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in primate conservation at Oxford Brookes University. My research focuses on conserving orangutans and as such I will be traveling to Indonesia for three months to conduct of a behavioral study on juveniles living together in captivity at a rehabilitation center.  I will be looking specifically at Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus.) This species is listed as endangered on the IUCN red list and the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) is listed as critically endangered. With the expansion of the ever efficient oil palm plantations, we are losing habitat fast so these animals are arriving in rehab centers at a rapid pace. I believe that understanding species specific behavior and development is vital for successfully rehabilitating primates and reintroducing them back into the wild. Furthermore, I believe that rehab and reintroduction critical to the conservation of these animals. (Untitled by Madeline Thaler)I have been working with primate rehabilitation for the last five years. In this time, I have seen first hand what monkeys and apes are up against in their wild homes. Infants and babies are brought into these centers on a daily basis and since they are so much like us, they need a mother to survive and cannot just be mended and sent right back into the wild. This means there is a huge amount of time invested in trying to get these animals back to their homes in the wild. (Contemplation by S. Yume. Used under CC BY 2.0)More than 1200 orang-utans reside in rehabilitation centres in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Though the ultimate goal is for these animals to be reintroduced into protected forests, they often spend their entire infancy or longer (5-10 years) in captivity where they learn how to be an orang-utan from humans and the many other orphaned orang-utans they are housed with. Orang-utans in captive environments like this have an increased opportunity for social interactions than they do in the wild. As such, they have been observed to engage in social play at greater rates. The role of play in mammalian development is still a greatly debated topic.  Play is often described as a ""luxury"" or ""opportunity"" behavior that will only be observed when the costs of play are low because all proximate needs are met or as a behavior critical for learning socially appropriate behaviors specific to living in large groups.  However, the overall functions and role in development of social play in orangutan development can be more difficult to understand given the relatively solitary habits of orangutans in the wild and there are many questions raised by this variation in rates of social play seen in captive orang-utans as opposed to wild ones.  (Mother and Infant by Helen Buckland. Used under CC BY 2.0)
Since play is both used as an indicator of adequate welfare and believed to be critical for primate development, my research aims to further understand the function of play in captive orang-utan development by observing individual variation in play types and frequencies of juvenile orang-utans housed together at International Animal Rescue's (IAR) orang-utan rehabilitation centre near Ketapang in West Kalimantan, Indonesia.  You can learn more about IAR here: http://www.internationalanimalrescue.org/orangu...


All my data and results will be made available to IAR who I will be collaborating with and an official report will be given to them with any recommendations that this research results in. This is to ensure that my research will not simply be a theoretical document, but a practical piece of literature that will be available to the people working closest with these animals to keep them safe.

<strong>AN ALBUM OF SONGS AND MUSIC VIDEOS FROM <a href=""https://joshua-halpern-ly08.squarespace.com/any-time-now-people"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HOME HOWLS</a></strong>
</h4>
<p><br/>Home Howls produces seriously funny climate justice imaginings, live looped into unexpectedly sexy beats, sometimes costumed as future animals, or nuclear meltdowns, or galactic supercluster starsheds, making for astonishing live performances. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Ok, Home Howls is still all Josh so far, looping his voice and adding each instrument himself live, including drums, guitar, even glockenspeil. This campaign continues the expansion of Josh's environminstrel/edge-jester musical horizons by supporting the creation of a new band, recording an album's worth of music, and completing music videos Josh and his generous friends have already begun.</p>
<p>Home Howls and a rotating crew of friends spent every Friday in June 2014 filming at stunning locations around the Bay, where the confluence of local and global ecologies are transforming most rapidly, most beautifully, or most worryingly. With this campaign, we will be able to start up filming again for <b>JULY 2015!<br/><br/></b></p>

</div>
<p>Joshua Halpern, MA (bio below) works for a Bay Area Honey Farm and for the last five years has been offering his eco educational art and teachings ~ in the lineage of his teacher and neighbor Joanna Macy's Work that Reconnects ~ as gifts, for free. Now he's poised to expand on some huge collaborations ~ but there are several next steps that are out of Josh's reach as a honey vendor. </p>
<p>This campaign is an opportunity for you to support both the steps necessary for Josh's next specific projects to blossom (currently an album of music, a video series, and teaching events) as well as expanding the world of Eco Courageous collaborations and exchanges between both biologically and culturally diverse communities.</p>
<br/><ul>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">$14,000 - </b><i>Any Time Now People - Home Howls Video Series</i> <br/>Short videos have become a language we all speak, and are one of the primary branches of Eco Courageous Education Creations. We have a series of videos planned touring transformational ecology sites around the world.<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Putting climate catastrophe questions to sexy funny beats on a tour of gorgeously transforming Bay Area sacred ecology sites, Josh Halpern has already created hours of beautiful content, just with the help of his phenomenal friends, the beauty of the shifting landscape, and almost no money whatsoever. <br/><br/>The videos - part musical celebration, part environmental education - are ready! Ready for (rather than Josh filling all of these roles) more amazing talent, locations, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">costumes, camera and sound crew, with all the professionals needed for production and postproduction - an editor, an animator, an effects person - all to pay fairly, and then produce and publish and share together, as widely as possible!<br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">$9,000 - </b><i>Any Time Now People - Home Howls Album:</i> Music videos depend on beautifully recorded music, which means getting Josh out of his house. This covers the costs of recording a 12 song album for an independent artist: recording, musician fees, mixing/mastering, production, design, printing, distribution, etc.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">$3,000 - </b><i>Training Fees - </i>To improve Josh's skills and resources as an educational facilitator, as well as to connect with other eco-artist-activists and communities, Josh will further explore The Work That Reconnects with Joanna Macy, take courses on planetary hospice with Stephen Jenkinson's Orphan Wisdom School, learn Ecology of Leadership with James Stark, pursue Justice And Ecology Training with Occidental Arts and Ecology Center, commit to vocal trainings for the music, and Wilderness First Aid Certifications for the nature immersions  ~ with fees ranging from $250 to $1500.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">$2,400 -</b> <i>SONY NEX-VG30 Camera:</i> An exceptional video camera (huge sensor, interchangeable lenses) for taking Eco Courageous media making to the next outstanding levels.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">$650 - </b><i>K8 1000 Watt Speaker - Live Performances:</i><b style=""font-weight: bold;""> </b>All of Home Howls songs so far have come through a sweet but tiny box amp. Each show has featured one or two folks with the feedback ""I couldn't hear all your words."" We're gonna make sure you all hear all the words!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">$500 </b><i>Workshop Expansion Budget:</i> Covers initial space fees, promotional items, food and transportation, website upgrades.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">$150 - </b><i>Mini Keyboard and MIDI controller</i>: For expanding the range of howls.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">$150 - </b><i>Effects Pedal:</i> How we can be affective without effects??<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">$150 - </b><i>A Decent Microphone: </i>So you can clearly hear our ecologies transforming!<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which adds up exactly to a <b>$30,000 </b>campaign, and then if we add the 10% that Indiegogo takes off, brings us to <b>$33,000</b>. Any funds received over this mark will be put towards increasing the depth and breadth of Eco Courageous Education Creations by developing: </p>
<p>a kids <b>CURRICULUM, </b>more <b>TOURS</b>, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">a traveling <b>ROADSHOW</b>, a television <b>SERIES</b>, and more creative collaborations!</span></p>
<p>Each of us learn to hold and share our experiences of the shifting planet at our own pace. Joining each other in common concern with honesty, humor, gratitude and courage opens supportive and imaginative healing space for solidarity and skill-sharing. You can help these creative courageous blossoms bloom.<br/><br/><br/></p>

Josh was born and raised at the confluence of the Matawan and Wopowog Rivers in Princeton NJ, the son of two professors committed to both the journeys of the soul and the achievement of justice on the planet. Josh grew up playing in his father's garden and in the woods by the river, loving writing, music, and photography from a young age.

<p>While in school, Josh’s father <a href=""http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2010/02/24/pages/2380/index.xml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Manfred</a> died, and Josh spent the next several years making art unfolding his family’s reactions to this loss. A few of these works can be found <a href=""http://outsidejosh.com/2009/01/07/143/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. Having discovered a great deal about his roots, Josh turned his attention to stories outside of himself, launched <a href=""http://www.outsidejosh.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">outsidejosh.com</a>, and went <a href=""http://wwoof.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WWOOFing</a> - traveling around the world for 9 months in 2007, lending a hand on organic farms in Hawaii, the Philippines, Thailand, and India. Josh’s film about this journey WWOOF ‘n Wander (53 mins) is <a href=""http://outsidejosh.wordpress.com/wwoof-n-wander/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">streaming</a> here in seven parts.</p>

This can cover a range of earthly scales - from building local systems to perpetuate what's precious to different communities - to attending to the needs of families whose homes can no longer hold them, falling into the already staggering numbers of climate-based refugees around the world. Josh doesn't have anywhere near all the answers, but in consultation work, teaching events, and creative placeplaying, he cultivates a steady ability to hold and share the questions, and integrates great diversities of perspective for deeply crucial choices, drawing from different directions depending on the details, including ~</p>

<p>So far, Josh has continued to offer almost of all of the creative eco-educational art and teaching he's developed for free, as gifts to the communities he loves and is concerned for. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Josh trusts this work has become the confluence of his life's rivers, and he sees helping folks deal with the changing planet as his life's work - far beyond this campaign and even beyond the places he currently wishes to hold as home. It would be helpful for this commitment to generate a livable income while the world changes and our work ramps up, but Josh will continue to show up as a bridge between generations, however strong the winds on the bridge may blow. Crowd-funding allows for the grounded and realizable steps to build this commitment to the levels where fruitful collaborations become inevitable.</span></p>

He feels this sounds poetic and honors the imaginal cells in the dying caterpillars that transform into butterflies. Most folks will not have met a Metamorphosis Ecologist before, or even want to. Josh messes up plans by truth telling. But he's learned to shake people up lovingly, and for some time he's been able to cultivate a life where community really supports and encourages new ways of relating. And there are generations of learning ahead of us. Healing relationships with the transforming earth is, as they say, a ""growth industry"".</p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Josh is deeply committed to providing avenues where silenced voices (the oppressed, the near extinct, the magical) can sing, places where each of our neighbors is welcomed in wholeness. He is driven to make a real difference in healing people's relationships with their home. So it doesn't always feel clear how dancing in disappearing marshes, or dressing up as future animals </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>helps anyone directly</i></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. This is a very important question for each of us. What does help? Josh is really curious. Some aspects of our lives change too quickly, others agonizingly slow. No matter what we might do, it gets grim sometimes. There's truth in that hopelessness. But doom and gloom don't inspire, won't ignite anyone's passion or agency. We each know the ways we try to help or hold back the tide. But holding and sharing our shifting worlds also seems to require letting in increasing amounts of unbearable information and persisting with courage towards what seems impossible.</span><br/>

<br/>This reveals one of our main gifts of this moment - the challenge of embracing <i>radical uncertainty.</i> As Joanna Macy says, ""If anyone tells you they know how it's going to turn out, don't believe them!"" When facing the deepest unknowns we've collectively encountered, doesn't it help to feel held in the supportive arms of a rapidly expanding community of eco-activist souls rising in love and defense of the planet? We're moving through and beyond our individual separate stories, into strategies and solutions that include all of us. Supporting creativity and courage, mixing humor into our heartbreak, we learn to hold and share this sacred home together, and we imagine and commit to all the healing our particular place and position provides.</div>

""When our lights fail we'll count stars.
When our aquifers empty, we'll drink love. 
It'll probably be tomorrow morning,
I would wake up early just in case."" 
- from ""Waiting For Things To Get Worse""


                                                    

Our worlds are changing so fast! Seems like each day brings more drastic news. As we learn to integrate each new change facing our generation on the planet - environmental, cultural, political, technological, and spiritual  thresholds all arriving at the same time - it's a lot of transformation to imagine going through.How's it all been going for you? How is your home shifting - or not - with the times? The choices we make around the planet THIS DECADE will touch generations to come, affect vital limbs of earthly life. But we're waiting, held down, overwhelmed, met with our most intense feelings - despair, dread, rage, guilt, shame - and so we understandably numb out, turn away again. The world is too much.
Because encouraging humanity to focus on climate change requires creative education, regenerative spaces, and radical art ~ 

Eco Courageous Education Creationsare currently creating CURRICULUM ~offering three branches of engagement, which you can support today ~


EVENTS * MEDIA MAKING * ART-ACTIVISM
ECEC is currently creating eco-curriculum ~ offering conscious, compassionate, fun, and often seriously funny educational ecological experiences.We share skills around ecological reconnection and resilience, practice placemaking and peacemaking, and expand our connections through outdoor immersions, art, music, movement, and media making. Importantly, we also set safe space for holding and processing what may show up as difficult, intense, frightening, or numbed feelings for our rapidly changing homescapes. We mean home to include both house and town, body and bioregion, family and planet. We appreciate different scales and perspectives. And we give special consideration to solastalgia - the homesickness experienced as our homes disappear around us.Right now Eco Courageous work needs your help - to encourage more communities, children and adults, to share skills for facing our climate challenges creatively and courageously - via concrete steps that catalyze collaborations, inspire climate confidence, and strengthen solidarities.The specific projects supported through this campaign are a new album of music, a video series, and ecocourageous events and workshops. See video updates above, or text below, for more details.                                        NEW PRESS!Town Topics: Princeton Native Joshua Halpern Has Unique Approach to Climate CrisisHub Oakland: Transforming Home Together: Solastalgia, Solidarity, and Silliness

ART-ACTIVISM





ARTIVISM includes: Music, Dance, Performance, Theater, Placeplay


CURRENT PROJECT: ANY TIME NOW PEOPLE 


AN ALBUM OF SONGS AND MUSIC VIDEOS FROM HOME HOWLS

Home Howls produces seriously funny climate justice imaginings, live looped into unexpectedly sexy beats, sometimes costumed as future animals, or nuclear meltdowns, or galactic supercluster starsheds, making for astonishing live performances. 

Ok, Home Howls is still all Josh so far, looping his voice and adding each instrument himself live, including drums, guitar, even glockenspeil. This campaign continues the expansion of Josh's environminstrel/edge-jester musical horizons by supporting the creation of a new band, recording an album's worth of music, and completing music videos Josh and his generous friends have already begun.
Home Howls and a rotating crew of friends spent every Friday in June 2014 filming at stunning locations around the Bay, where the confluence of local and global ecologies are transforming most rapidly, most beautifully, or most worryingly. With this campaign, we will be able to start up filming again for JULY 2015!






WHAT YOU'RE $UPPORTING:

Joshua Halpern, MA (bio below) works for a Bay Area Honey Farm and for the last five years has been offering his eco educational art and teachings ~ in the lineage of his teacher and neighbor Joanna Macy's Work that Reconnects ~ as gifts, for free. Now he's poised to expand on some huge collaborations ~ but there are several next steps that are out of Josh's reach as a honey vendor. 
This campaign is an opportunity for you to support both the steps necessary for Josh's next specific projects to blossom (currently an album of music, a video series, and teaching events) as well as expanding the world of Eco Courageous collaborations and exchanges between both biologically and culturally diverse communities.


$14,000 - Any Time Now People - Home Howls Video Series Short videos have become a language we all speak, and are one of the primary branches of Eco Courageous Education Creations. We have a series of videos planned touring transformational ecology sites around the world.Putting climate catastrophe questions to sexy funny beats on a tour of gorgeously transforming Bay Area sacred ecology sites, Josh Halpern has already created hours of beautiful content, just with the help of his phenomenal friends, the beauty of the shifting landscape, and almost no money whatsoever. The videos - part musical celebration, part environmental education - are ready! Ready for (rather than Josh filling all of these roles) more amazing talent, locations, costumes, camera and sound crew, with all the professionals needed for production and postproduction - an editor, an animator, an effects person - all to pay fairly, and then produce and publish and share together, as widely as possible!


$9,000 - Any Time Now People - Home Howls Album: Music videos depend on beautifully recorded music, which means getting Josh out of his house. This covers the costs of recording a 12 song album for an independent artist: recording, musician fees, mixing/mastering, production, design, printing, distribution, etc.


$3,000 - Training Fees - To improve Josh's skills and resources as an educational facilitator, as well as to connect with other eco-artist-activists and communities, Josh will further explore The Work That Reconnects with Joanna Macy, take courses on planetary hospice with Stephen Jenkinson's Orphan Wisdom School, learn Ecology of Leadership with James Stark, pursue Justice And Ecology Training with Occidental Arts and Ecology Center, commit to vocal trainings for the music, and Wilderness First Aid Certifications for the nature immersions  ~ with fees ranging from $250 to $1500.


$2,400 - SONY NEX-VG30 Camera: An exceptional video camera (huge sensor, interchangeable lenses) for taking Eco Courageous media making to the next outstanding levels.


$650 - K8 1000 Watt Speaker - Live Performances: All of Home Howls songs so far have come through a sweet but tiny box amp. Each show has featured one or two folks with the feedback ""I couldn't hear all your words."" We're gonna make sure you all hear all the words!


$500 Workshop Expansion Budget: Covers initial space fees, promotional items, food and transportation, website upgrades.


$150 - Mini Keyboard and MIDI controller: For expanding the range of howls.


$150 - Effects Pedal: How we can be affective without effects??


$150 - A Decent Microphone: So you can clearly hear our ecologies transforming!


Which adds up exactly to a $30,000 campaign, and then if we add the 10% that Indiegogo takes off, brings us to $33,000. Any funds received over this mark will be put towards increasing the depth and breadth of Eco Courageous Education Creations by developing: 
a kids CURRICULUM, more TOURS, a traveling ROADSHOW, a television SERIES, and more creative collaborations!
Each of us learn to hold and share our experiences of the shifting planet at our own pace. Joining each other in common concern with honesty, humor, gratitude and courage opens supportive and imaginative healing space for solidarity and skill-sharing. You can help these creative courageous blossoms bloom.

Face your future! We have some ecoGORRRgeous PERKS!!!

ROOTS AND ORIGINS






The art and teachings carried inside this Eco Courageous basket, while gratefully held in supportive community, have so far remained solely the soul expression of 33 year old Joshua Halpern, MA,  in the direct lineage of Josh's neighbor and teacher Joanna Macy, who has stood for six decades as one of the greatest living guides for healing the woundings of our planet.




Josh has been sharing sacred earthly relationships through art for over two decades, with a special sensitivity to the relationships that accompany transforming home. Josh was born and raised at the confluence of the Matawan and Wopowog Rivers in Princeton NJ, the son of two professors committed to both the journeys of the soul and the achievement of justice on the planet. Josh grew up playing in his father's garden and in the woods by the river, loving writing, music, and photography from a young age. He received a BFA in Film/Television from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts in 2004.


While in school, Josh’s father Manfred died, and Josh spent the next several years making art unfolding his family’s reactions to this loss. A few of these works can be found here. Having discovered a great deal about his roots, Josh turned his attention to stories outside of himself, launched outsidejosh.com, and went WWOOFing - traveling around the world for 9 months in 2007, lending a hand on organic farms in Hawaii, the Philippines, Thailand, and India. Josh’s film about this journey WWOOF ‘n Wander (53 mins) is streaming here in seven parts.

Upon returning to his home hemisphere, Josh worked for three years as the Organic Produce Coordinator for the best natural food store in New Jersey, the Whole Earth Center, deepening his connection with local food and food justice, and helping his mother vacate the house his family had called home for 50 years.






Working with his heart and hands, helping tend close relationships between people and soil, Josh began to recognize planetary forces interconnecting within the choices available to neighborhoods on the ground. He became moved to really study all the strands - what's unravelling and what's weaving together around us - and add more minds to his mix of understanding.
So in 2010 Josh moved to the Bay Area to pursue a masters degree at the California Institute of Integral Studies, studying with a community of deeply caring and conscious cross-pollinating scholars, healers and activists, receiving his MA in Integral Ecologies in 2013.

Integral Ecologists help communities and individuals regenerate mutually enhancing relationships with the Earth. This can cover a range of earthly scales - from building local systems to perpetuate what's precious to different communities - to attending to the needs of families whose homes can no longer hold them, falling into the already staggering numbers of climate-based refugees around the world. Josh doesn't have anywhere near all the answers, but in consultation work, teaching events, and creative placeplaying, he cultivates a steady ability to hold and share the questions, and integrates great diversities of perspective for deeply crucial choices, drawing from different directions depending on the details, including ~

While not creating educational art, Josh juuuuuuust gets by selling local raw honey at farmers markets all over the Bay Area for Marshall's Honey Farm, and he loves this job - the opportunity to trade fresh food with neighbors, talk about how the bees are doing, track how the drought's affecting his farmer friends at the market. 


So far, Josh has continued to offer almost of all of the creative eco-educational art and teaching he's developed for free, as gifts to the communities he loves and is concerned for. Josh trusts this work has become the confluence of his life's rivers, and he sees helping folks deal with the changing planet as his life's work - far beyond this campaign and even beyond the places he currently wishes to hold as home. It would be helpful for this commitment to generate a livable income while the world changes and our work ramps up, but Josh will continue to show up as a bridge between generations, however strong the winds on the bridge may blow. Crowd-funding allows for the grounded and realizable steps to build this commitment to the levels where fruitful collaborations become inevitable.


 Josh is currently calling himself a Metamorphosis Ecologist (though you can call him whatever you want.) He feels this sounds poetic and honors the imaginal cells in the dying caterpillars that transform into butterflies. Most folks will not have met a Metamorphosis Ecologist before, or even want to. Josh messes up plans by truth telling. But he's learned to shake people up lovingly, and for some time he's been able to cultivate a life where community really supports and encourages new ways of relating. And there are generations of learning ahead of us. Healing relationships with the transforming earth is, as they say, a ""growth industry"".

Challenges and Potentials
Indiegogo encourages us to be forthright with challenges our projects might face. There are personal and political challenges to the work Eco Courageous Education Creations have planned here.




Josh is deeply committed to providing avenues where silenced voices (the oppressed, the near extinct, the magical) can sing, places where each of our neighbors is welcomed in wholeness. He is driven to make a real difference in healing people's relationships with their home. So it doesn't always feel clear how dancing in disappearing marshes, or dressing up as future animals helps anyone directly. This is a very important question for each of us. What does help? Josh is really curious. Some aspects of our lives change too quickly, others agonizingly slow. No matter what we might do, it gets grim sometimes. There's truth in that hopelessness. But doom and gloom don't inspire, won't ignite anyone's passion or agency. We each know the ways we try to help or hold back the tide. But holding and sharing our shifting worlds also seems to require letting in increasing amounts of unbearable information and persisting with courage towards what seems impossible.





This reveals one of our main gifts of this moment - the challenge of embracing radical uncertainty. As Joanna Macy says, ""If anyone tells you they know how it's going to turn out, don't believe them!"" When facing the deepest unknowns we've collectively encountered, doesn't it help to feel held in the supportive arms of a rapidly expanding community of eco-activist souls rising in love and defense of the planet? We're moving through and beyond our individual separate stories, into strategies and solutions that include all of us. Supporting creativity and courage, mixing humor into our heartbreak, we learn to hold and share this sacred home together, and we imagine and commit to all the healing our particular place and position provides.


Thank you for doing everything you can today! Our brightest lights, currently throwing themselves into these climate questions, having reached the effectiveness limits of graphs and charts and lectures, all continue to call out for alternative educational models, and for radical art.








This is what Josh, through his body and soul, is able to offer today. You can help him continue bringing these offerings to the world. Josh releases expectations that Eco Courageous Education Creations will save civilization or rescue the functioning biosphere. But every chance he gets, Josh very much wants to support honesty, humor, healing, gratitude, generosity, inspiration, imagination, curiosity, and courage ~ as we unfurl our future together.

Or, as the poet Rainer Maria Rilke comes through Joanna Macy's translation, to ""love the things as no one has thought to love them"":


Dear darkening ground,you've endured so patiently the walls we've built,perhaps you'll give the cities one more hourand grant the churches and cloisters two.And those that labor—let their workgrip them another five hours, or seven,before you become forest again, and water, and widening wildernessin that hour of inconceivable terrorwhen you take back your namefrom all things.Just give me a little more time!I want to love the thingsas no one has thought to love them,until they're worthy of you and real.- Book of Hours, I 61







Other Ways You Can Help
Deep gratitude for sharing this moment together, and of course not everyone is able to help financially. If you'd like to collaborate with us, enliven the eco courageous community, come on down! Or we can come to you! Get in touch, joshua@ecocourageous.com, for any reason in the world. We'd love if you send us a testimonial or endorsement or blurb if you've been already moved by Josh's work. But really, everything you do that encourages courage in the face of climate change is absolutely welcome. Courage grows from our togetherness.
Eco Courageous Education Creations also has a patreon page (coming soon), as well as ecocourageous.com where you can read more details, and all shares, tweets, likes, and in person hugs are super beneficial and welcome as well.
Thanks,
Fruitful transformations!

<p></p></span></h2><h2><span><b>My Story</b></span></h2><p></p><p></p>
<p>Hi. I am James. I had a realization that
as a species we are running out of time, and<span style=""background-color: initial;""> in order to reach our future, we need
to make a global change on how we live.</span></p>
<p>We need to change the fate of our world by
changing the way we grow and consume food. We need to have a plant-based diet
and live a plant-based lifestyle. The plant-based diet is already working and
proven by millions of people. And the number of Vegans around the world is
growing everyday.</p>
<p>The way to accomplish this change is by
creating a social media website called onebillionvegans.com, that brings together
billions of Vegans as a community.</p>
<p>No longer will you spend hours sifting
through profiles on social media websites, hoping to find a fellow Vegan who
happens to live nearby, let alone shares your ambitions. With this Vegan social
media website, you simply sign up, create your profile, and find likeminded
people with every click. </p>
<p>We want all of us to be able to experience
living a long and healthy plant-based life.</p><p></p><h2>The Problem</h2><p>
</p><p>We are growing enough food to feed 10
billion people, but instead, we choose to feed our crops and give over 50% of
our fresh water to animals that we consume as our food.</p>
<p>In the last 50 years, we have destroyed
more than half of our world’s trees. Trees are cut down at a rate of 40
football fields a minute just to give cows a place to graze!</p>
<p>The world is dying. Starvation is killing
14,000 people every day, almost 100,000 people die every week.</p>
We really are out of time, and have to act now, so the world does not
continue to starve, suffocate, and poison itself. It is time to heal, so
we can reach the future, for ourselves and for our next generations.<div>
<br/><p><b style=""font-size: 30px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Large-scale projects call for large-scale
ambitions. We are looking to raise at least $1 million dollars. This is a massive
undertaking that requires web development, web hosting, experts, programmers,
marketing, and hiring other amazing staff members. </p>
<p>Your contribution of any amount will help
us in the building of this Vegan social media website for a Plant-Based world. </p>
<p>What we all get is a healthier planet, healthier people, and more
time on Earth for everyone.</p>

</div></div>","My Story
Hi. I am James. I had a realization that
as a species we are running out of time, and in order to reach our future, we need
to make a global change on how we live.
We need to change the fate of our world by
changing the way we grow and consume food. We need to have a plant-based diet
and live a plant-based lifestyle. The plant-based diet is already working and
proven by millions of people. And the number of Vegans around the world is
growing everyday.
The way to accomplish this change is by
creating a social media website called onebillionvegans.com, that brings together
billions of Vegans as a community.
No longer will you spend hours sifting
through profiles on social media websites, hoping to find a fellow Vegan who
happens to live nearby, let alone shares your ambitions. With this Vegan social
media website, you simply sign up, create your profile, and find likeminded
people with every click. 
We want all of us to be able to experience
living a long and healthy plant-based life.The Problem
We are growing enough food to feed 10
billion people, but instead, we choose to feed our crops and give over 50% of
our fresh water to animals that we consume as our food.
In the last 50 years, we have destroyed
more than half of our world’s trees. Trees are cut down at a rate of 40
football fields a minute just to give cows a place to graze!
The world is dying. Starvation is killing
14,000 people every day, almost 100,000 people die every week.
We really are out of time, and have to act now, so the world does not
continue to starve, suffocate, and poison itself. It is time to heal, so
we can reach the future, for ourselves and for our next generations.
What I Need & What You Get



Large-scale projects call for large-scale
ambitions. We are looking to raise at least $1 million dollars. This is a massive
undertaking that requires web development, web hosting, experts, programmers,
marketing, and hiring other amazing staff members. 
Your contribution of any amount will help
us in the building of this Vegan social media website for a Plant-Based world. 
What we all get is a healthier planet, healthier people, and more
time on Earth for everyone.

You can make the difference!

<h3>Help us fight deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa!</h3>
<br/>
<p><b>Why did the hammock plant two trees? </b>To solve the <b>ROOT</b> of the problem. See what we did there? ;)</p>
<p>In an effort to accomplish our mission of serving both our hammocking friends and the planet, Vitae Brands has chosen to focus on planting trees.  Doing so will not only help replenish our environment, but also ensure that you always have a great place to ""hang out.""  While we think planting one tree per hammock would definitely make a difference in the world, we would hate to leave you hanging with only one trunk...so we've decided to plant <b>TWO TREES FOR EVERY HAMMOCK SOLD.  </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/vitae-explore-duoswing-hammock-two-trees-program/x/www.vitaebrands.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://vitaebrands.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://vitaebrands.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vitae Brands</a> was founded to be a mechanism of positive change in the World.</li>
<li>We need your help launching our first product and planting our first round of trees!</li>
<li>Help us reach, or, even better <b>SURPASS</b> our initial goal of planting 500 trees! In partnership with <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/vitae-explore-duoswing-hammock-two-trees-program/x/www.trees.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://trees.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://trees.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trees for the Future</a>, for EVERY hammock sold we will fund the planting of two trees in Sub-Saharan Africa to help heal the wounds of deforestation. </li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What's in it for you?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of the physical distance between you and the Rainforest, the well-being of our home relies on the integrity of our forests.  Therefore, by supporting our Two Trees Program, you are investing directly in your future.  </li>
<li>You will be one of the <b>FIRST</b> proud new owners of a Vitae Explore DuoSwing adventure hammock!  </li>
<li>Every time you use your hammock you will swing happily knowing there will always be two trees in the world to strap into!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need <b>YOU</b> to help us launch our new Vitae Explore DuoSwing adventure hammock!</li>
<li>Your hammock bundle will include a Vitae Explore DuoSwing adventure hammock, a set of color-coordinated Vitae Explore hammock hanging straps and carry sack.  Oh and make sure to grab some firewood and your beverage of choice, because with your hammock you will also receive a magnesium fire starter that doubles as a bottle opener. <b>#hammockhappyhour</b>
</li>
<li>250 Hammocks (with straps) = 500 trees; help us reach this goal and fight deforestation around the globe!  Together, we can generate positive change.</li>
<li><b>It's very important to us that we surpass our goal and create momentum; so to give you more incentive, if we surpass our goal of 250 hammocks we will DOUBLE our tree planting committment. Here's the math: 250 hammocks = 500 trees. 251 hammocks = 1,004 trees.</b></li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Have you ever read ""The Lorax"" by Dr. Suess?  Turns out he was quite the environmentalist and the story of deforestation is truer today than ever.  Deforestation is <b>REAL.</b> Here are a few facts:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">By the year 2030, we might only have 10% of Rainforests left and it can all disappear in a hundred years.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Up to 28,000 species can go extinct in the next quarter century due to deforestation.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">The top reasons for deforestation include agriculture, logging, and biofuels.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Check out more deforestation facts and statistics over at <a href=""http://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/deforestation-facts-and-statistics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/deforestation-facts-and-statistics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theworldcounts.com</a>.</li>

Why did the hammock plant two trees? To solve the ROOT of the problem. See what we did there? ;)
In an effort to accomplish our mission of serving both our hammocking friends and the planet, Vitae Brands has chosen to focus on planting trees.  Doing so will not only help replenish our environment, but also ensure that you always have a great place to ""hang out.""  While we think planting one tree per hammock would definitely make a difference in the world, we would hate to leave you hanging with only one trunk...so we've decided to plant TWO TREES FOR EVERY HAMMOCK SOLD.  


Vitae Brands was founded to be a mechanism of positive change in the World.
We need your help launching our first product and planting our first round of trees!
Help us reach, or, even better SURPASS our initial goal of planting 500 trees! In partnership with Trees for the Future, for EVERY hammock sold we will fund the planting of two trees in Sub-Saharan Africa to help heal the wounds of deforestation. 

What's in it for you?

Regardless of the physical distance between you and the Rainforest, the well-being of our home relies on the integrity of our forests.  Therefore, by supporting our Two Trees Program, you are investing directly in your future.  
You will be one of the FIRST proud new owners of a Vitae Explore DuoSwing adventure hammock!  
Every time you use your hammock you will swing happily knowing there will always be two trees in the world to strap into!



What We Need & What You Get

We need YOU to help us launch our new Vitae Explore DuoSwing adventure hammock!
Your hammock bundle will include a Vitae Explore DuoSwing adventure hammock, a set of color-coordinated Vitae Explore hammock hanging straps and carry sack.  Oh and make sure to grab some firewood and your beverage of choice, because with your hammock you will also receive a magnesium fire starter that doubles as a bottle opener. #hammockhappyhour

250 Hammocks (with straps) = 500 trees; help us reach this goal and fight deforestation around the globe!  Together, we can generate positive change.
It's very important to us that we surpass our goal and create momentum; so to give you more incentive, if we surpass our goal of 250 hammocks we will DOUBLE our tree planting committment. Here's the math: 250 hammocks = 500 trees. 251 hammocks = 1,004 trees.

The Impact
Have you ever read ""The Lorax"" by Dr. Suess?  Turns out he was quite the environmentalist and the story of deforestation is truer today than ever.  Deforestation is REAL. Here are a few facts:

By the year 2030, we might only have 10% of Rainforests left and it can all disappear in a hundred years.
Up to 28,000 species can go extinct in the next quarter century due to deforestation.
The top reasons for deforestation include agriculture, logging, and biofuels.
Check out more deforestation facts and statistics over at www.theworldcounts.com.


Here's how we will make a difference:


The net cooling effect of a young, healthy tree is equivalent to ten room-size air conditioners operating 20 hours a day. - U.S. Department of Agriculture

The planting of trees means improved water quality, resulting in less runoff and erosion. This allows more recharging of the ground water supply. Wooded areas help prevent the transport of sediment and chemicals into streams. - USDA Forest Service
One acre of forest absorbs six tons of carbon dioxide and puts out four tons of oxygen. This is enough to meet the annual needs of 18 people. -U.S. Department of Agriculture

<h3>Short Summary</h3>In 2015, we successfully created a documentary entitled <i>The Reality of Storm Chasing. </i>However exceptional this was, our main goal &amp; focus has always been reliable and accurate weather reports via social media. The only way we can do that is by being in the field during severe weather events such as supercell thunderstorms, tornadoes, blizzards, winter storms and other extreme weather events. In our quest to provide accurate weather reports to our followers and local weather offices, we would like to invest in professional weather instrumentation such as the ones below. I, Francis Lavigne-Theriault, travel over 50 000km in a given tornado ""season"" across North America, which usually is from April to August for the team. In doing so, I have seen my fair share of severe weather from close lightning strikes to large tornadoes. Currently living in the Canadian Prairies, I have chased supercell thunderstorms from Manitoba to the Mexico border and Ontario. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455599290/y6nnrdeegwkzxcuhxykm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455611467/m7dlrkpvmjklpj0xvu11.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Oxygen and carbon dioxide, when balanced in an ecosystem, help to keep plants, trees, animals, and humans alive.</p><p>Sounds great, right? But carbon, and carbon dioxide, isn't just produced when we breathe. Let’s talk about fossil fuels. We use fossil fuels to power almost everything: electricity, gas for our cars and planes, heating for our homes, etc. When we burn fossil fuels, carbon is released into the air. And with more people, more houses, and more industry than ever before, we are burning tons and tons of carbon dioxide. Our plants and trees can’t keep up. Trees are also being cut down at high rates to make room for growing populations, the agriculture industry, infrastructure, and more. That's too much work for our trees!</p><p>Carbon dioxide is beneficial when it is being used to nourish plants and trees, but in such high quantities, it can be disastrous for our planet. It is a “greenhouse gas;” when greenhouse gases are stuck in the environment with nowhere to go, they trap heat that would normally be leaving the Earth. This heat is what’s causing global warming and climate change.</p><p>Global warming is melting polar ice caps and glaciers, increasing sea levels, increasing the risk of wildfires and droughts, and causing extreme weather changes and events. If we don’t step up and reduce our carbon footprints, global warming will continue to have a catastrophic effect on our earth.</p><p>We need to reduce our carbon emissions, and we need to do it now. That’s why Sustainability Initiatives has launched Our Future Footprint; if one person, and one t-shirt, can reduce 100 pounds of carbon dioxide and produce 500 pounds of oxygen in one year, we can make a change and reduce our carbon footprint. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495658360/q8xnvl6gjflarpwqaxsm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>We love this place.

By contributing to preservation, conservation, and education initiatives, Our Future Footprint is determined to make a difference in our community, and leave a positive impact on the Earth we love.Our Future Footprint t-shirts use only sustainable materials, including bamboo, hemp, and organic cotton. They are responsibly made by a carbon-neutral manufacturer. We also offer a lifetime guarantee on our shirts; if it isn’t the most comfortable shirt you’ve worn, or you want to return it for any reason, you can send it right back.Megan and Keil are wearing our silk screened bamboo shirts.We can also offer the guarantee of feeling good about your purchase with Our Future Footprint. By buying with us, you can reduce your carbon footprint in three different ways:       Preservation: Our Future Footprint has teamed up with OneTreePlanted to turn our carbon-neutral apparel into a carbon-reduction movement. For every t-shirt that you purchase with Our Future Footprint, we will plant three trees. Conservation: The Earth is beautiful as it is...let's keep it that way. Our Future Footprint is dedicating 3% of top-line revenue to conservation initiatives. Education: We want a greener Earth to pass on to our children, but the work doesn't stop with us. Education is key for keeping our Earth alive for many generations to come. Our Future Footprint will also donate 3% of top-line revenue to education initiatives; the reality of climate change, and what we can do to keep our planet healthy, will be passed on to our neighbors, friends, and children.Our Future Footprint is proudly based in Austin, Texas. Megan is wearing our embroidered baseball cap.Why Indiegogo? Why Now?Our Future Footprint shirts and apparel are only available through our Indiegogo campaign (for now.) If Our Future Footprint was a tree, it would still be a seedling. In order to give our company a proper launch, we want to do something big. That’s where Indiegogo comes in.With roughly $50,000, Our Future Footprint can get our feet off the ground, and approximately 5,000 trees in the ground. By planting 5,000 trees, we will be able to absorb over 160,000 pounds of carbon dioxide, and produce over 800,000 pounds of oxygen each year. Over the trees's lifetime, we can absorb 6.4 million pounds of carbon dioxide and produce 32 million pounds of oxygen.Indiegogo is just the beginning for Our Future Footprint. After our launch, we will expand our business to include different types of apparel, more designs, and eventually buying materials to produce apparel ourselves, in the United States. The more we raise through Indiegogo, the more we donate to conservation and education initiatives. The more shirts that are purchased, the more trees that are planted.After our campaign has finished, you can purchase apparel and learn more about our movement on our website.Your donation is your vote for a company that will give back to its community through preservation, conservation, and education. Your donation is a vote for company that believes sustainability should be a top priority for any business, and that each of us can make a difference.Want to donate? Thank you so much!We appreciate every dollar. If you want to take advantage of exclusive apparel for Indiegogo backers, consider claiming one of our perks: Plant a Tree with OneTreePlanted:In April, we helped to plant trees with OneTreePlanted in Boulder, Colorado.

<p><b>Today's waste problem in Central America</b><br/></p><p>In many
countries in Central America waste has become over the past years a real
problem and threat to destabilize the environment. Recycling activities on
local country level do exist, but mainly focused on few materials and also
focused on exporting these materials for further processing in other countries.</p>
<p>Many wastes
land either on landfills/city dumps, are burned or simply end up along roads,
in rivers, lakes and through rivers in the oceans. Contamination of valuable
and exquisite flora and fauna within the countries, within the water systems
and alongside coastal areas where they are washed up has become a real threat
to natural and economical structures of each country.</p>
<p>Roughly,
following solid wastes are being recycled and/or collected:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Metals,
non-ferrous (f.e. copper, tin, precious metals, hard-metals, etc.) and ferrous
(HMS 1, HMS 2, etc.)</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Paper
and cardboard</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Plastics
(mainly PET, some Poleolefines (HDPE, LDPE &amp; PP))</p>
<p><u>Metals</u><span>:  both
ferrous and non-ferrous metals are mainly exported to other countries for
recycling purposes. Local recycling plants are either non-existent, or
capacities are too little or materials involved cannot be recycled properly due
to missing technology. Exports are to Guatemala, Colombia, Chile but mainly to
Mexico, USA, India and China</span></p>
<p><u>Paper and Cardboard:</u><span>  The
capacities of existing paper mills for recycling purposes cannot cover by far
the volumes collected of both paper and cardboard. Most volumes are exported to
Colombia and mainly overseas</span></p>
<p><u>Plastics</u><span>:  PET
recycling as such is well developed in most countries. This due to the fact
that PET bottles are by far the largest volume of post-consumer plastic scrap
occurring in all markets. PET recycling can be split into following segments:</span></p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Collecting
and pressing into bales for export within Central America and export to
overseas</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Cold
washing into PET flakes for export overseas</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Hot
washing into PET flakes for local use and mainly export overseas</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Bottle2Bottle
by few large breweries</p>
<p>Poleolefines (Polyethylene/PE &amp;
Polypropylene/PP)</p>
<p>PE and PP related materials are partially
collected and some are recycled locally. “Partially” has following meaning:</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Post
Industrial waste is normally “rather” clean. Many of the post industrial wastes
are collected and recycled. Nevertheless, many post industrial plastic wastes
don’t have proper ways currently to re-enter the recycling circle (especially
Styrofoam/EPS and engineering/technical plastics)</p>
<p><span>o<span> 
</span></span>Post
consumer waste of PE &amp; PP is the vast majority of plastic wastes next to
PET bottles. Here substantial volumes are collected and prepared for recycling,
but also substantial volumes still remain a problem for disposal and especially
the environment</p>
<p>Plastics from dismantled cars</p>
<p>Most plastics from dismantled cars are
currently not collected and simply disposed of. Many plastics are technical
plastics of which almost no know how exists how to handle them properly.</p>
<p>Technical plastics</p>
<p>Many technical plastics also originate from
electrical appliances and computers and TV’s/Flat screens. While some
specialized companies are dismantling such products to gather the metal
components from it (copper &amp; precious metals) the plastics are mainly
disposed of after dismantling</p>
<p>Other plastics in general</p>
<p>Many other commonly used plastics like CD’s,
Covers of CD’s and DVD’s, Styrofoam, Polystyrol from cups and dairy products
are landing in the landfill or are simply disposed of, again harming the
environment.</p>
<p>The main
problems we see and have encountered in many countries is that very few plastic
materials are well known, but most of them are unknown how to handle them. The
missing know how on plastics and the ways how to handle and recycle them is a
main reason that too many plastics end up either in landfills or simply next to
the streets, rivers, lakes and oceans. <br/></p><p>
</p><p><b><u>Our project</u></b></p>
<p>Our project
focusses initially on plastics only. By bringing know how and technology to
various countries we decrease the littering of plastic wastes into the natural
and populated areas and environment and also decreasing the air pollution since
lots of plastics are burned too.</p>
<p>Only with
financial incentives this goal can be achieved and by doing so many positive
effects are generated. Here a small listing</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Increase
recycling volumes of plastics with effect of substantially lowering littering
of plastics into the nature</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Creating
new jobs for low income and barely educated parts of the population in each
country, thus lowering unemployment. We aim especially at a workforce of up to
80% of women. On one hand it is a great chance for women originating from poorer/low
income parts of the society. Many are uneducated, illerate and have little
chances to find stable work opportunities. On the other hand income generated
by women are of great importance to support themselves and their family as this
income is not wasted on non-day2day expenditures in general. Women also bring
the better qualities for our venture as precision and accuracy in the
selection/grading process of plastics is most important. </p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Assisting
governmental institutions/municipalities to implement and realize new waste
regulations (f.e. Costa Rica)</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Increased
protection of the natural habitat and at the same time preventing waste to
spoil into natural areas important for the tourism industries</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Sustainable
development of recycling awareness and implementation on country level</p>
<p><u>Current
activities</u></p>
<p>The main
principle of our project is to work with local partners on country level. The
local partner has to be already active in some kind of recycling activity and
provide the initial infrastructure and network with the market to become
operational on short notice.</p>
<p><u>Guatemala</u></p>
<p>Our
carefully chosen partner is located in Guatemala City. They are currently
operating 5 warehouses – 3 in GC, 2 in the country side – to collect and grade
various grades of paper &amp; cardboard. Their total monthly volume handled
today is approx. 4000t. Our partner has a supplier network of approx. 500 small
to medium sized companies who now also start to collect all kinds of plastics
for our processing plant.</p>
<p>At this
moment we have provided following know how and first technology:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Plastic
grinder with capacity of approx. 700 kg output per hour</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>We
have started educating the staff on material level</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Periphery
machines have been acquired locally and have been installed (running belt to
feed the grinder, blower&amp;cyclones to automatically collect the grinded
material, washing line to wash the plastics after being grinded)</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Manual
classification has started and a special bunker system for intermediate storage
for each classified material is being prepared and installed at this moment</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Honduras</u></p>
<p>Our
carefully chosen partner is located in San Pedro Sula. His current business
focusses only on metal scrap collection, grading, compacting and exporting the
metals to smelters. The owner and CEO of the company has a long history within
PET recycling and brings lots of experience on the equipment side to handle
plastics.</p>
<p>At this
moment we have provided following know how and technology</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>2
plastic grinders with a capacity of approx. 700kg and 400 kg output per hour</p>

<p></p></div>","Today's waste problem in Central AmericaIn many
countries in Central America waste has become over the past years a real
problem and threat to destabilize the environment. Recycling activities on
local country level do exist, but mainly focused on few materials and also
focused on exporting these materials for further processing in other countries.
Many wastes
land either on landfills/city dumps, are burned or simply end up along roads,
in rivers, lakes and through rivers in the oceans. Contamination of valuable
and exquisite flora and fauna within the countries, within the water systems
and alongside coastal areas where they are washed up has become a real threat
to natural and economical structures of each country.
Roughly,
following solid wastes are being recycled and/or collected:
- 
Metals,
non-ferrous (f.e. copper, tin, precious metals, hard-metals, etc.) and ferrous
(HMS 1, HMS 2, etc.)
- 
Paper
and cardboard
- 
Plastics
(mainly PET, some Poleolefines (HDPE, LDPE & PP))
Metals:  both
ferrous and non-ferrous metals are mainly exported to other countries for
recycling purposes. Local recycling plants are either non-existent, or
capacities are too little or materials involved cannot be recycled properly due
to missing technology. Exports are to Guatemala, Colombia, Chile but mainly to
Mexico, USA, India and China
Paper and Cardboard:  The
capacities of existing paper mills for recycling purposes cannot cover by far
the volumes collected of both paper and cardboard. Most volumes are exported to
Colombia and mainly overseas
Plastics:  PET
recycling as such is well developed in most countries. This due to the fact
that PET bottles are by far the largest volume of post-consumer plastic scrap
occurring in all markets. PET recycling can be split into following segments:
o 
Collecting
and pressing into bales for export within Central America and export to
overseas
o 
Cold
washing into PET flakes for export overseas
o 
Hot
washing into PET flakes for local use and mainly export overseas
o 
Bottle2Bottle
by few large breweries
Poleolefines (Polyethylene/PE &
Polypropylene/PP)
PE and PP related materials are partially
collected and some are recycled locally. “Partially” has following meaning:
o 
Post
Industrial waste is normally “rather” clean. Many of the post industrial wastes
are collected and recycled. Nevertheless, many post industrial plastic wastes
don’t have proper ways currently to re-enter the recycling circle (especially
Styrofoam/EPS and engineering/technical plastics)
o 
Post
consumer waste of PE & PP is the vast majority of plastic wastes next to
PET bottles. Here substantial volumes are collected and prepared for recycling,
but also substantial volumes still remain a problem for disposal and especially
the environment
Plastics from dismantled cars
Most plastics from dismantled cars are
currently not collected and simply disposed of. Many plastics are technical
plastics of which almost no know how exists how to handle them properly.
Technical plastics
Many technical plastics also originate from
electrical appliances and computers and TV’s/Flat screens. While some
specialized companies are dismantling such products to gather the metal
components from it (copper & precious metals) the plastics are mainly
disposed of after dismantling
Other plastics in general
Many other commonly used plastics like CD’s,
Covers of CD’s and DVD’s, Styrofoam, Polystyrol from cups and dairy products
are landing in the landfill or are simply disposed of, again harming the
environment.
The main
problems we see and have encountered in many countries is that very few plastic
materials are well known, but most of them are unknown how to handle them. The
missing know how on plastics and the ways how to handle and recycle them is a
main reason that too many plastics end up either in landfills or simply next to
the streets, rivers, lakes and oceans. 
Our project
Our project
focusses initially on plastics only. By bringing know how and technology to
various countries we decrease the littering of plastic wastes into the natural
and populated areas and environment and also decreasing the air pollution since
lots of plastics are burned too.
Only with
financial incentives this goal can be achieved and by doing so many positive
effects are generated. Here a small listing
- 
Increase
recycling volumes of plastics with effect of substantially lowering littering
of plastics into the nature
- 
Creating
new jobs for low income and barely educated parts of the population in each
country, thus lowering unemployment. We aim especially at a workforce of up to
80% of women. On one hand it is a great chance for women originating from poorer/low
income parts of the society. Many are uneducated, illerate and have little
chances to find stable work opportunities. On the other hand income generated
by women are of great importance to support themselves and their family as this
income is not wasted on non-day2day expenditures in general. Women also bring
the better qualities for our venture as precision and accuracy in the
selection/grading process of plastics is most important. 
- 
Assisting
governmental institutions/municipalities to implement and realize new waste
regulations (f.e. Costa Rica)
- 
Increased
protection of the natural habitat and at the same time preventing waste to
spoil into natural areas important for the tourism industries
- 
Sustainable
development of recycling awareness and implementation on country level
Current
activities
The main
principle of our project is to work with local partners on country level. The
local partner has to be already active in some kind of recycling activity and
provide the initial infrastructure and network with the market to become
operational on short notice.
Guatemala
Our
carefully chosen partner is located in Guatemala City. They are currently
operating 5 warehouses – 3 in GC, 2 in the country side – to collect and grade
various grades of paper & cardboard. Their total monthly volume handled
today is approx. 4000t. Our partner has a supplier network of approx. 500 small
to medium sized companies who now also start to collect all kinds of plastics
for our processing plant.
At this
moment we have provided following know how and first technology:
- 
Plastic
grinder with capacity of approx. 700 kg output per hour
- 
We
have started educating the staff on material level
- 
Periphery
machines have been acquired locally and have been installed (running belt to
feed the grinder, blower&cyclones to automatically collect the grinded
material, washing line to wash the plastics after being grinded)
- 
Manual
classification has started and a special bunker system for intermediate storage
for each classified material is being prepared and installed at this moment

Honduras
Our
carefully chosen partner is located in San Pedro Sula. His current business
focusses only on metal scrap collection, grading, compacting and exporting the
metals to smelters. The owner and CEO of the company has a long history within
PET recycling and brings lots of experience on the equipment side to handle
plastics.
At this
moment we have provided following know how and technology
- 
2
plastic grinders with a capacity of approx. 700kg and 400 kg output per hour
- 
We
have started educating the staff on material level
- 
Periphery
machines have been acquired locally and have been installed (running belt to
feed the grinder, blower & cyclones to automatically collect the grinded
material, washing line to wash the plastics after being grinded)
- 
A
large conveyor belt for classification is currently being built so overall
efficiency and volumes to be processed can be increased
- 
Manual
classification has started and a special bunker system for intermediate storage
for each classified material is being prepared and installed at this moment
Sales
channels
- 
Local
sales for producers of various products
- 
Export
within Latin America, North America, Europe and Asia
Milestones
1.  Establish supply channels of raw
materials to be able to collect and process min 200-300t or raw materials per
month till the end of this year
2.  Establish contact to municipalities
and various organizations to setup up with assistance of the
government/municipalities own collection points for various materials
3.  Further development and installation
of technical equipment for collection and processing (min 1 fully integrated
processing lines encompassing all steps of processing after classification by
end of this year per country)
4.  Installing other technical equipment
to enlarge the scope of handling waste plastics like Styrofoam
5.  Increase staff headcount and
educating both staff and supply side to increase awareness of all plastics we
can handle
6.  Establishing different processing
points in each country, thus enlarging the geographical collection nation wide
Vision and
goals of our project
1.  Reduce environmental pollution !
2.  Increase recycling cycle for
currently wasted plastics by bringing them back into the world of raw materials
3.  New job opportunities directly at
own processing plants and many on side of small to medium size collectors. Main
job opportunities will be for women due to their work quality, reliability and
sustainability of income generation for their families
4.  Clean and environmentally friendly
process of making waste into raw material
5.  Establish new till today undeveloped
areas of recycling, thus further collecting other materials for clean and
proper recycling (possible chemical wastes, batteries, organic waste for
bio-gas manufacturing, etc.)
Investments till today
Till today,
we have personally invested substantially in our first established setup of
operational activities. All current investments have been based with own equity
without being supported by any local or international government or
institution.
Investments planned
The
investments needed/planned are to further develop our activities in each
country on technological side and collection side of the raw materials.
Collection points
within the country side:
- 
Establishing
collection centers within the country side of each country. This to enable
local small to medium size providers of raw materials to supply their locally
collected materials without having to worry about logistics within the country.
Since loose material as of weight cannot be economically be transported
efficiently, also lack of transportation possibilities prevent many small to
medium size providers to collect and supply materials to us. 
- 
On
the other hand it also does not make sense to use many trucks to drive all over
the country and collect loose material due to weight inefficiencies and
pollution factors
- 
It
is planned to setup small baling machines in easy accessible locations through
the country. Local providers will be able to deliver with little efforts the
volumes to our collection yards, this enlarging the collection areas and
reducing littering at the same time countrywide 
- 
Once
the material is received, a first classification will be done and then goods
will be compacted by baling machines for efficient onward transportation on the
road to our central operational center in each country.
- 
The
decentralized collection structure enables a sustainable supply and at the same
time brings the biggest effect on creating new jobs in many parts of the
countries involved – indirect new jobs for people working for the small to
medium sized providers/suppliers and also direct new jobs at our collection
centers where materials will be classified and pressed into bales.
Central operational center
Since we do
expect overall volume to grow very fast, also due to the fact of setting up
local collection points within each country, new fully integrated processing
lines will be required to be able to handle the upcoming volumes. Fully
integrated lines encompass
-

<h3>This is important</h3>
<p>In Latin America we are very vulnerable climate change but this is not our only worry, issues such as poverty, disasters and poor access to education are always in the agenda.</p>
<p>This makes it harder for  climate change to be in the top agenda of politicians, NGOs and the public. La Ruta del Clima works hard to show the links between climate change and sustainable development. We know is important and want the public to help us. </p>
<p>Public participation is key to maintain this issue at the top agendas of government and the private sector. If citizens participate we can make make the right decisions and speed up the actions needed to secure a sustainable, adaptable and low carbon society.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project is a challenge for a small NGO from Latin America. Participation from our region in Climate Change Conferences is always small due to high cost and complicated access. However, this are the same challenges the Latin American public faces to know more about this issue. And, that is why we believe are work is important and as volunteers we know it can make a positive impact in our communities. </p>
<ul>
<li>We overcome this obstacle 3 times for the  past Climate Change Conferences.</li>
<li>This has made us experts in using small budget to make big actions.</li>
<li>To solve the high cost we volunteer for 2 weeks of non stop work, find the lowest cost accommodation and travel arrangements, look for partnerships, and try to generate the best material that we can. </li>
<li>We know it matters and that it can be done together with your support.</li>

Climate Action is a project of advocacy and awareness.

We need resources to send 5 volunteers to the Climate Change Conference during 2 weeks.
The team will work 14 days continuously doing interviews, videos, writing notes and sharing on social media important details to make this negotiations more understandable, Also, we will be advocating in Side Events for the relevance of education and awareness in the fight on climate change.
We need $8.000 usd to fund this actions in order to cover the accommodation, materials and transportation.
You will be able to follow us day to day in this activities and get a unique glimpse on the highest level of climate negotiations.
Also, by supporting us with your donation you will help Latin Americans have access to easy to understand and insightful information to motivate them to participate in climate change governance locally and internationally.  


Short Summary
Climate change conferences are the heart of decision-making. We aim to bring Latin America closer to this process. Our team is ready to participate in the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP23 to provide easy to understand and insightful information for Spanish speakers everywhere.
We are a volunteer based NGO: our team has lots of experience, having participated in the past 3 conferences with innovative media campaigns and events.  That is why La Ruta del Clima is soliciting donations to make it real this year for it´s project Climate Action - COP23.
Your donation will help us send a team of journalists and environmental professionals to this year's conference COP23, where we will work hard to report on advancements on the fight to stop climate change.
We will carry out interviews to important stakeholders, share information in social media, create videos,  participate in side events and specially, our team will dialogue with countries to promote education as a key action to face climate change.
 


This is important
In Latin America we are very vulnerable climate change but this is not our only worry, issues such as poverty, disasters and poor access to education are always in the agenda.
This makes it harder for  climate change to be in the top agenda of politicians, NGOs and the public. La Ruta del Clima works hard to show the links between climate change and sustainable development. We know is important and want the public to help us. 
Public participation is key to maintain this issue at the top agendas of government and the private sector. If citizens participate we can make make the right decisions and speed up the actions needed to secure a sustainable, adaptable and low carbon society.
Climate Action  COP23 is a project to boost awareness and provide more information to Latin American public on Climate Change.  




The Impact
We will produce insightful and interesting awareness and education multimedia material for Latin Americans on climate change negotiations:

This is very important because few Latin American NGOs participate in this spaces and most news and information are not in spanish.
The spanish speaking public will have access to videos, notes, infographics and day to day social media content to follow the most important event in climate change governance.
The impact and results of these actions can be asses through our previous work:

Video interviews from international events.

Notes and articles for awareness and education.

Members and partnerships.

Participation in international conferences.

Side Event during COP22 and COP21.

Climate Change Radio program.
Webinars on climate change.
Organization of public participation activities.

Raising funds to buy fieldwork equipment for local students.


Aiming to leave a lasting legacy by helping students to gain experience.

The Full Story: Supporting Conservation In Madagascar
Madagascar has lost somewhere between 80-90% of it's rainforest. What remains supports thousands of species found nowhere else in the world; but it is under threat.
Ultimately, the only way to protect the forest for the future, is to build capacity within local communities and train the next generation of Malagasy students to be the conservationists of tomorrow - and this is what we aim to do.
In December 2015, we are leading an international expedition to Northern Madagascar to work with Malagasy scientists and students in the field, studying rare reptiles and amphibians. We aim to develop new science, to understand and help preserve Madagascar's surviving forests.  With your support, we can give young Malagasy students skills and experience, to allow them to build a future in conservation.
We would love your support to help us reach our goal!



With your support, we can engage more students and supply them with better equipment.

We want to supply our local students with the following things:


A student bursary and materials to help them write up and publish their research dissertations and gain their degrees at university - the start of a bright conservation career!
Transport costs to get them from their home village to our research site.
A small daily stipend to support their work, this is stipulated by the government field research organisation.
Head torches and flashlights (most of our work will be at night!).
Tents and sleeping bags.
Extra science equipment such as calipers and scales (we use these to measure the animals).


Our existing funding means we can supply all of the food and expensive research equipment that we need, so anything pledged will go directly to the items above. In addition, these items will be donated at the end of the expedition to the local university, so that hopefully many other students can benefit too.

  The good news is that we have enough funding to launch the expedition.
Fortunately, our research is already being supported several highly respected organisations: The Royal Geographical Society, the Scientific Exploration Society and the Zoological Society of London.
This not only means that a panel of scientists thinks that our research is very worthwhile, but also that many of the logistics, admin and permit costs have already been covered. Every international member of the team has also contributed £1000 of their own money to cover flights and costs, as well as their own equipment and time to help make this expedition a reality.
So the good news is that the expedition WILL take place! But we have an opportunity to reach more students, and that is why we need your help.


  The Science What is our research all about, here is an outline:
One of the problems of deforestation is that it doesn't just reduce the total area of surviving forest, it also drastically increases the proportion of forest edges (see photo below).
This is a problem, because edges are a very different habitat. Edges are hotter and drier (as the tree canopy provides less protection), there is also greater human disturbance, hunting, wind damage and more. All in all, edges are very different, but we don't know how that affects the species that live in the forest, and we don't know how 'deep' edge effects occur: a.k.a. how bad the effect is.

We aim to study these edges, in order to find out which species are resilient, and which are not. Species that can't survive on edges could be at far greater risk of extinction than we realise (and some may still be unknown to science!). 
In a practical sense, with much conservation attention now focused on forest 
regeneration and habitat corridors, we hope to be able to assess the 
value of smaller fragments which have large proportions of edge habitat. Thus, we could prioritize those fragments which have the potential to support 
viable relict populations of rare species.

Earthship Biotecture is teaming up with a local NGO, called Tagma, in Jaureguiberry, Uruguay, to build the FIRST SELF-SUSTAINABLE PUBLIC SCHOOL in all LATIN AMERICA the next february 2016... AND I WANT TO DOCUMENT IT!!

I have an  Associate's Degree in the  solar energy field as designer and installer of photovoltaic and thermal  systems and a good general knowledge on other renewable energies.
The Earthships are the most self-sustainable buildings on earth today. They maximize the recycling by employing used tires, bottles, cans, plastic bottles and metal harvested parts from all kinds of appliances that are found in dumps and also produce their own food in a sustainable way and reuse water up to four times.

Español             Breve Resumen 


 
Earthship Biotecture se ha asociado con una ONG local llamada Tagma, en Jaureguiberry, Uruguay, para construir la PRIMERA ESCUELA PUBLICA AUTOSUSTENTABLE DE TODA LATINOAMERICA el próximo febrero 2016... Y YO QUIERO DOCUMENTARLO!!  


                                             

My nombre es Ismael Romero, soy un ciudadano uruguayo viviendo en Colombia y siempre he sido un apasionado de las energías verdes y el reciclaje. Tengo un título técnico en el campo de la energía solar como diseñador e instalador de sistemas fotovoltaicos y térmicos y un buen conocimiento general sobre otras energías renovables.
Los Earthships son las edificaciones más autosustentables sobre la tierra actualmente. Maximizan el reciclaje mediante el empleo de neumáticos usados, botellas, latas, botellas plásticas y partes métalicas recolectadas de todo tipo de aparatos encontrados en vertederos, además producen sus propios alimentos de una manera sustentable y resan el agua hasta cuatro veces.



 El objetivo de esta campaña es recaudar fondos para asistir a la Academia Earthship y así aprender el proceso de construcción. Realizaré un documental que no solo va a mostrar mis días de aprendizaje, sino que además va a analizar lo que implica en términos de desarrollo social, ambiental y educativo.

Estaré entrevistando al equipo de Tagma, así como al equipo de Earthship, a los voluntarios y a los estudiantes para llevar toda esa experiencia e información de vuelta a Colombia y fundar una ONG para recrear el proyecto de construcción de una nueva escuela auto sustentable.

Our solution combines sustainable waste management practices for Indian cities with improving agricultural productivity through use of compost.We have set up a compost plant in the Okhla area of Delhi as a pioneering project focusing on processing of municipal solid waste into Compost. We ensure that the Compost produced by the plant is of high quality, meeting the norms defined by the Government and is safe for agricultural use. The Compost rejuvenates the soil that has been depleted of micro-nutrients and soil carbon through overuse of chemical fertilizers. The plant was set up at a cost of ~US$5.6M and has a capacity to process 200 tons of Municipal Solid Waste per day. It costs US$0.6M annually to run the plant and provides jobs to ~40 full time employees who are mostly migrated rural labor dependent on part-time work or rag-picking.The plant has the distinction of being the first municipal composting plant in the world to receive carbon credits. So how does a Composting Plant work ?PRE-SORTINGThe process starts with pre-sorting where Municipal Solid Waste is fed into the hopper with the help of grab and passes through 100 mm trommel  to separate (+) 100 mm and (-) 100 mm fractions. Manual segregation of large inorganic material and recyclables is also done by helpers on the conveyors itself before going to trommel. WINDROW COMPOSTING(-) 100 mm fraction received at pre-sorting contains more than 70 % biodegradable waste. This material is mixed with microbial culture (in a ratio 1 ltr per MT of waste) and moisture of material is maintained to about 50% w/w after which windrow (a trapezoidal structure) is formed of dimension max. 3m base width, max. 2.5m height, max. 2.5m top width and length according to quantity of material.Weekly turning of windrow is done to maintain the aerobic condition inside the heap. Regular monitoring of temperature and oxygen level is done to ensure optimal rate of decomposition. This process takes 28 days to complete. COARSE SEGREGATIONNow this material is fed to the coarse segregation section which has two consecutive trammels having screen sizes of 35 mm and 16 mm respectively. (-) 16 mm material received is called semi-finished material and is further cured for 15 days to ensure complete decomposition and stabilization of material FINE REFINEMENTSemi-finished material is fed to the refinement section having screen size of 4 mm. During this process cured semi-finish material is first passed through 4 mm trammel. Then, (-) 4mm material is passed through a magnetic separator to ensure removal of any ferrous containing material, then through destoners and cyclone separators to ensure removal of stones, glass pieces, non-ferrous metals and silt. The final product/outcome is fine textured, blackish brown in color, earthy smelled and free flowing material and is called city compost.The quality of finished material is tested in our own in-house laboratory and in third party laboratory as well on regular interval. PACKINGThe finished material is packed manually in different bag sizes depending on orders FINAL PRODUCTThe packing is done in different sizes 1Kg, 2Kg, 5Kg, 10Kg and 50 Kg; Loose compost is also sold to the farmers or others. Rewards & RecognitionWe've been picking up some recognition along the way:
1st Municipal Solid Waste compost plant in the world to be issued Carbon Credits

<h3>What's up with fish? </h3>
<p>The world’s population is growing rapidly, and the global demand for animal protein—from fish to poultry, beef, and pork— is growing with it. But there’s a problem: animal feeds are made from wild-caught fish like anchovies and sardines. These fish are caught using highly destructive fishing methods that result in unintentional by-catch and the destruction of coral reefs. One third of global fish catch doesn't go towards direct human consumption; it goes to feeding animals. As a result, <a href=""http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/problems/problems_fishing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more than 85% of the world’s fisheries are exploited</a>. <strong>We are feeding fish to other animals, and it doesn’t make sense.</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the world's population is increasing rapidly and is <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/2015-report.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">projected to hit 9.7 billion by 2050</a>. We desperately need a new way to feed a growing population that is not at odds with the health of our oceans. </p>
<h3>Meet the black soldier fly.</h3>
<p>The black soldier fly is a friendly non-buzzing, non-biting fly native to tropical and temperate regions of the world. As larvae, it feeds ravenously on organic waste—everything from spent grains from breweries to fruit and veggie peels. We divert this organic waste as our input and the black soldier fly larvae metabolize it to become our nutrient-rich output. This insect protein is then sold to chicken and fish farmers as a great protein base for their animals. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>We partner with food and beverage companies—like breweries, restaurants, and fruit &amp; vegetable processors—and implement an automated, retrofitted shipping container we like to call The Refinery. We’re working with some of the world’s leading experts in black soldier flies to develop an algorithm that automates the entire process. Our sensors measure data in realtime and the algorithm maximizes efficiency. Meanwhile, a community of microbes pre-treats the waste, breaking down fibrous content into more digestible compounds so we can work with a wide range of organic waste streams. </p>

<p>Esta es una campaña de unos 6 - 8 meses para crear conciencia sobre la contaminación plástica por toda Latinoamérica. Para esto vamos a preparar generadores de cambio quienes van a guiar a las personas en su comunidad para reducir la cantidad de plástico que llega y afecta el medio ambiente. </p>
<p>Esta campaña que comenzó a mediados de marzo en Baja California, México, está enfocada en crear cambio a través de talleres de medio día. Con éstos se logra que las personas entiendan el impacto causado por la basura plástica tanto en el ambiente como en nuestra salud y que se lleven herramientas –como charlas e ideas de posibles campañas que pueden liderar- para ellos sean el motor de cambio en sus comunidades. El taller también trata de incentivar <i>el amor a la naturaleza y desde ahí la necesidad de respetar y cuidarla</i>. </p>
<p><strong>WorldCleanup plantó la semilla para lograr la prohibición de las bolsas plásticas en Panamá. </strong></p>
<p>La efectividad de la Campaña de Worldcleanup fue comprobada con la prohibición de la bolsa plástica en Panamá. </p>
<p>En abril 2017, Martina de Marcos entrenó a través de Skype a jóvenes universitarios quienes dieron una charla/plática informativa a 150 personas, uno de ellos, un legislador de Panamá Samir Gozaine. </p>
<p>El Sr. Gozaine quedó tan consternado con la charla/plática que presentó la propuesta de ley para prohibir la bolsa plástica en mayo 2017. Su ley fue aprobada y firmada por el presidente de la República en enero de este año.</p>
<p>Si pudimos juntos lograr eso con unos pocos líderes comunitarios, imagínense lo que podemos hacer con unos cuantos cientos y dispersos por toda Latinoamérica. </p>
<p><strong>Sobre Martina de Marcos</strong></p>
<p>Con mucha experiencia y sucesos en lograr campañas de concientización ambiental, como el ejemplo de Panamá, la fundadora de WorldCleanup, Martina de Marcos, está a la cabeza de esta campaña. </p>
<p>Creció en Argentina, se mudó a Australia en el año 2010 donde estudió Ciencias Marinas en la Universidad de Sydney, Australia. Actualmente escribe su tesis para su maestría en Gestión Ambiental con una investigación específica en la gestión de la basura plástica en lugares remotos costeros. </p>
<p>Durante el 2016 trabajó como pasante y consultora para ONU Medio Ambiente donde lideró campañas de concientización sobre la basura marina, en especial el plástico, y ahí es donde la idea de WorldCleanup nació. </p>
<p><strong>Líderes comunitarios</strong></p>
<p>Los líderes comunitarios van a ser entrenados y certificados por WorldCleanup. Ellos van a poder crear cambio en sus comunidades y van a ser parte de la comunidad Worldcleanup donde podrán compartir sus iniciativas, consultar dudas y motivarse. </p>
<p><strong>El problema</strong></p>
<p>El problema con el plástico es un problema real y comprobado por cientos de artículos científicos. 8 millones de toneladas son desechadas o llegan al océano cada año, equivalente a 1 camnión lleno de basura por minuto, degradando ecosistemas, entrando en la cadena alimenticia, creando polución visual y problemas de salud. </p>
<p>Hay una tendencia creciente alrededor del mundo para reducir el consumo del plástico de un solo uso, mejorar los materiales que están siendo utilizados para facilitar una economía circular, incrementar y mejorar el reciclado (que es casi nulo), limpiar el océano y prevenir la polución plástica. </p>
<p>Pero, en Latinoamérica, este tipo de campañas, aunque cada vez haya más, es bastante limitado. Esto quiere decir que nuestra comunidad en general desconoce los problemas que trae la basura plástica al medio ambiente y nuestra salud en general. </p>
<p>Desafortunadamente, es común ver ciudades sin programas gubernamentales de reciclado y zonas donde la recolección por parte del gobierno es inexistente, dejando a las casas y comercios como únicas responsables de la gestión de la basura. </p>
<p>Como resultado, las personas dejan basura tirada en el medio ambiente como bosques, plazas y playas, y en sus comunidades en general, sin entender el problema que estamos causando. </p>
<p>Esta falta de conocimiento y entendimiento es lo que WorldCleanup quiere cambiar. </p>
<p><strong>Los fondos recaudados</strong></p>
<p>Los fondos serán destinados a cubrir los costos de transporte, alojamientos y demás que incurre la campaña. </p>
<p>Muchas gracias! </p>

Con éstos se logra que las personas entiendan el impacto causado por la basura plástica tanto en el ambiente como en nuestra salud y que se lleven herramientas –como charlas e ideas de posibles campañas que pueden liderar- para ellos sean el motor de cambio en sus comunidades. El taller también trata de incentivar el amor a la naturaleza y desde ahí la necesidad de respetar y cuidarla. 
WorldCleanup plantó la semilla para lograr la prohibición de las bolsas plásticas en Panamá. 
La efectividad de la Campaña de Worldcleanup fue comprobada con la prohibición de la bolsa plástica en Panamá. 
En abril 2017, Martina de Marcos entrenó a través de Skype a jóvenes universitarios quienes dieron una charla/plática informativa a 150 personas, uno de ellos, un legislador de Panamá Samir Gozaine. 
El Sr. Gozaine quedó tan consternado con la charla/plática que presentó la propuesta de ley para prohibir la bolsa plástica en mayo 2017. Su ley fue aprobada y firmada por el presidente de la República en enero de este año.
Si pudimos juntos lograr eso con unos pocos líderes comunitarios, imagínense lo que podemos hacer con unos cuantos cientos y dispersos por toda Latinoamérica. 
Sobre Martina de Marcos
Con mucha experiencia y sucesos en lograr campañas de concientización ambiental, como el ejemplo de Panamá, la fundadora de WorldCleanup, Martina de Marcos, está a la cabeza de esta campaña. 
Creció en Argentina, se mudó a Australia en el año 2010 donde estudió Ciencias Marinas en la Universidad de Sydney, Australia. Actualmente escribe su tesis para su maestría en Gestión Ambiental con una investigación específica en la gestión de la basura plástica en lugares remotos costeros. 
Durante el 2016 trabajó como pasante y consultora para ONU Medio Ambiente donde lideró campañas de concientización sobre la basura marina, en especial el plástico, y ahí es donde la idea de WorldCleanup nació. 
Líderes comunitarios
Los líderes comunitarios van a ser entrenados y certificados por WorldCleanup. Ellos van a poder crear cambio en sus comunidades y van a ser parte de la comunidad Worldcleanup donde podrán compartir sus iniciativas, consultar dudas y motivarse. 
El problema
El problema con el plástico es un problema real y comprobado por cientos de artículos científicos. 8 millones de toneladas son desechadas o llegan al océano cada año, equivalente a 1 camnión lleno de basura por minuto, degradando ecosistemas, entrando en la cadena alimenticia, creando polución visual y problemas de salud. 
Hay una tendencia creciente alrededor del mundo para reducir el consumo del plástico de un solo uso, mejorar los materiales que están siendo utilizados para facilitar una economía circular, incrementar y mejorar el reciclado (que es casi nulo), limpiar el océano y prevenir la polución plástica. 
Pero, en Latinoamérica, este tipo de campañas, aunque cada vez haya más, es bastante limitado. Esto quiere decir que nuestra comunidad en general desconoce los problemas que trae la basura plástica al medio ambiente y nuestra salud en general. 
Desafortunadamente, es común ver ciudades sin programas gubernamentales de reciclado y zonas donde la recolección por parte del gobierno es inexistente, dejando a las casas y comercios como únicas responsables de la gestión de la basura. 
Como resultado, las personas dejan basura tirada en el medio ambiente como bosques, plazas y playas, y en sus comunidades en general, sin entender el problema que estamos causando. 
Esta falta de conocimiento y entendimiento es lo que WorldCleanup quiere cambiar. 
Los fondos recaudados
Los fondos serán destinados a cubrir los costos de transporte, alojamientos y demás que incurre la campaña. 
Muchas gracias!

<strong>O</strong><strong>ur Path to Success:</strong>

<p>I believe that making art, by innovative training and creating unique artistic products, is a vector for sustainable development and for women’s empowerment, all while raising awareness of the socio-economic challenges to environmental conservation and notions of citizenship. As Moroccan female artist, I have dedicated my life to seek ways to improve the lives of others in my society through art, with a special focus on women and environment.</p>

<h3><strong>Our most successful Projects :</strong></h3>
<p>For our training program with the vision “Empowering Women through Art” we have been :</p>
<p>-2013 SEED Award, a United Nations Initiative for the Environment,</p>
<p>-  2014-15, laureate of the American Alliance of Museum for a Cultural Exchange Program supported by the States Department Washington DC, That involves 20 US and Moroccan women and also 16 US and Moroccan Students,</p>
<p>- And in 2016-17, Au Grain de Sésame collaborated to the UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) REVIS Project, a one year training project that aims to empower 25 Moroccan artisans from the north Est region in Morocco, until the access to the market.  </p>
<h3><strong>Make it happen:</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When you empower women through art education, they transmit what they learn to their children, families and communities. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It also develops their creativity and their respect for the environment and the human values. And of course increase their incomes which they spend on food, child education and health.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Many of our women have said to us “You’ve changed my life!”</strong></p>

Through my life, I have learned the important lesson: when women are empowered, it has a direct positive impact on their families, and communities prosper.
  This simple belief led me in 2013 to launch Au Grain de Sésame training workshop, the art and ecological design training program, to empower marginalized women through ecological art training.
Since 2013, more than 100 women have benefited from our training program with a real impact on improving their living conditions and that of their families and communities.


What your contribution will help us to achieve:
Over the past few years we have seen the positive impact that the training program has had on not just the local women but in the communities as a whole – and we want to do more! The future of the training program depends on support from our friends and customers.
We are launching this brand new innovative line of paper leather products, whose proceeds will contribute to ensuring the sustainability of the program and help us train even more women in the year to come.
Made from recycled paper and natural dyes, the handmade paper leather looks and feels like traditional animal leather but is much lighter, incredibly versatile, durable, and can be easily cleaned with watter.


Your support will contribute to help five Moroccan female artisans trained at Au Grain de Sésame to launch their own artisanal cooperative, ensure their own financial autonomy and train twenty five other women to the paper leather products making.
For every item purchased, 10% will be given to the women artisans and will go towards securing a space and launching their own cooperative.

The remaining proceeds will go towards registering the paper leather process with the national Moroccan patent office, the production of the first paper leather collection, and purchasing new equipment for the training workshops.


What we need and your thanks gift:
We need $15,000 to achieve our goal of launching the paper leather collection and help the Moroccan female artisans open their own cooperative.

Our Project Impact:
Climate change, poverty, access to knowledgel, gender equality, well-being: are the major problems and challenges of our time.
We all want to bring our seed and contribute to the most effectives solutions.
And Empowerment through Art Education is one of them!
 
Our most successful Projects :
For our training program with the vision “Empowering Women through Art” we have been :
-2013 SEED Award, a United Nations Initiative for the Environment,
-  2014-15, laureate of the American Alliance of Museum for a Cultural Exchange Program supported by the States Department Washington DC, That involves 20 US and Moroccan women and also 16 US and Moroccan Students,
- And in 2016-17, Au Grain de Sésame collaborated to the UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) REVIS Project, a one year training project that aims to empower 25 Moroccan artisans from the north Est region in Morocco, until the access to the market.  
Make it happen:
When you empower women through art education, they transmit what they learn to their children, families and communities. 
It also develops their creativity and their respect for the environment and the human values. And of course increase their incomes which they spend on food, child education and health.
Many of our women have said to us “You’ve changed my life!”
At Au Grain de Sésame we believe that empowering women is creating a powerful multiplier effect that benefits all of the society.
And when a women move forward, the world change with them!
Everyone can contribute to changing lives through sustainable development and helps women fulfill their economic potential and drive economic and social change in their communities.
By supporting us you contribute to making this happen!
Anything you can give is valuable to us!

<h3>About the Campaign </h3>
<p>I am 15 years old and I am the executive director of <a href=""https://www.universalwildlands.com/our-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Universal Wildlands</a>. I am launching this campaign because, in late summer 2018, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report outlining the necessary actions that must be taken to mitigate and even reversed climate change. The report urges immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon. One vital step in this process is reforesting an area the size of Canada and restoring tree farms to their natural state of high carbon storage and biological diversity.</p>
<p>You can take action today to restore and preserve forest lands in a region with one of the highest carbon storage potentials in the world. The Western Cascades of Washington State offers a chance to build a climate-resilient ecosystem at a time when much of the world’s forests are threatened by inevitable Global Warming. With our inaugural conservation project, we are laying the foundations for the return of wilderness to the Skagit River basin and greater Cascadia.</p>
<p>Every $850 we raise will aid us in the protection and restoration of one acre of land on Lookout Mountain, where we are working to create a 160-acre conservancy. This conservancy will restore important habitat for the Northern Spotted Owl and other endangered species. Its south-facing slope will encourage lichen growth and in turn, attract deer and other ungulates and their predators to the area. The Lookout Mountain property is also home to cliff habitat and a small patch of old-growth forests above a mountain gorge.</p>
<p>As a Founding Sponsor, you will be planting the seed of Universal Wildlands. The Lookout Mountain Conservation Project is our first campaign, and if successful will build a track record and the credibility needed for us to approach our first corporate and philanthropic sponsors. It will open the door to more ambitious conservation projects targeting large tracts of land including those with irreplaceable ecological value.</p>
<p>Help us change the future of this mountain and others throughout the Cascades from patchworks of clear cuts to towering forests stretching from the Fraser River Valley to the Columbia River Gorge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need You</h3>
<p>In order to restore Lookout Mountain, we need your help. We are raising $136,000 to purchase and protect Lookout Mountain and to fund its restoration. By sponsoring this project, you will aid us in the protection and restoration of one acre of land for every $850 you invest, sequestering carbon, adding to biodiversity and creating a natural cathedral where otherwise there would be clear cuts. Please contribute whatever you can; if it is in your means please consider protecting 10 or even 20 acres. Don't consider this a gift, consider it an investment in our future and an investment in life. Please give what you can, and if you can't give, please share this campaign on social media. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>By sponsoring an acre you will directly add to the amount of protected wilderness in the world. Your sponsorship will help us restore a mountain forest to health, making it more resilient to climate change and creating an ecosystem that can act as an ark of biodiversity for thousands of years.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Sequestration</strong></p>
<p>By protecting the temperate rainforest on Lookout mountain you will make possible the sequestration and storage of an estimated 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide per acre. Large-scale carbon storage of this type is critical to maintaining a healthy biosphere; every year we pump 30-40 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. The goal is no longer simply to curtail emissions, we must act to pull excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere or we will face dire consequences. By sponsoring the restoration of Lookout Mountain you will become part of the change we need if we are to have any hope of maintaining life as we know it on our beautiful blue-green earth.</p>
<p><strong>Preserving Biodiversity</strong></p>
<p>Over the past centuries, we have seen an unprecedented collapse of biodiversity all around the world. As we have cleared the planet of native ecosystems we have lost keystone species and innumerable flora and fauna. We are offering you a chance to help reverse this trend. Old-growth forests of Cascadia are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world. Once restored, the slopes of Lookout Mountain would support endangered species such as the Northern Spotted Owl. It would also develop the complex canopy only found in old growth forests, and become home to myriad insects, mosses, lichens, and birds. As climate change stresses many forest ecosystems around the world, the Pacific Northwest offers us a chance to promote biodiversity in one of the most climate-resilient eco-regions on Earth. Let us seize this chance and restore the forests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p><strong>A Forest Where There Once was Devastation</strong></p>
<p>Setting aside the importance of carbon sequestration and biodiversity, your contribution will also directly allow a previously logged second-generation forest to return to its natural state of grandeur. For every acre of land you protect, you will be preserving hundreds of trees that are home to dozens of small mammals and birds, as well as hundreds of thousands of individual organisms, from the Liquorice Ferns that grow on trees, to the brambles on the forest floor to the hundreds of insect species that live in every niche of this ecosystem. Simply put, you will create a legacy of vibrancy and life where there once was devastation.</p>

<p>My name is Gustavo Castro and I am a biologist working as scientific director at Ave Sol River Sanctuary. I have been studying jaguars for some years now and currently I am working in this region for my MSc thesis project, under the supervision of the International Institute for Wildlife Conservation and Management at the Costa Rican National University.</p>
<p>Working in this region for the last seven years has brought me close to its great ecological importance and its incredible biodiversity. It has also brought me close to its people and the needs and problems they face everyday. I realize that there is much to do to help safeguard the future of the region's natural ecosystems and its people, and for this reason, we ask for your help in exchange of any of our unique and exciting perks.</p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>Ave Sol River Sanctuary is a very secluded mountain/river lodge and natural reserve located in the Pacuare River, within the Talamanca Mountain Range, home of the country’s largest forested area. Ave Sol was first acquired and built ten years ago by my best friend, Álvaro Farías (aka Natu). Natu and I grew up together in the most biodiverse country (per square meter) in the world, Costa Rica. We both grew very close with nature, which soon became our greatest interest. I became a biologist and he became a professional naturalist and river guide. As a river guide, Natu fell in love with the Pacuare River and its exuberant tropical rainforests. He felt the need to give something back to the River and this is how, with very little resources, he managed to buy this land to preserve its wildlife and forests for the benefit of all future generations. I believe Natu is a true dreamer, the visionary and hands-on dream kind. I also believe that every major achievement starts as somebody’s dream.</p>
<p>He wanted to share the feeling of closeness with nature this place inspires with everybody. He believes that the more people come to know and love the Pacuare River and its forests, the more strength we gain to care for it, allowing it to flow powerful and free. This is how Ave Sol was raised in the year 2007, with the goal of protecting these invaluable ecosystems and supporting conservation efforts within this unique River basin. A River basin that serves as a very important life corridor that extends from the foothills of Costa Rica’s highest peaks (&gt;12000 ft.) all the way to the Caribbean Sea. As it turns out, the Pacuare is among the last free-flowing, healthy, and mostly clean rivers that remain in the tropics. Maintaining its ecosystems and keeping the River flowing free and clean represents the future of countless wildlife species in this region.</p>
<p>We want to seize the great opportunity to help mitigate some critical environmental issues affecting a region with such ecological importance. A region that is constantly been threatened by particular interests such as the damming of the Pacuare and heavy poaching. For this journey, we have set up a team of professionals in biology, management of natural resources, veterinary, health and wellness, and tourism.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542928309/nz6xb3ahbuewbo5kejd4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>Tropical rainforests are among the richest and most productive ecosystems in the world, and this region of Costa Rica in particular bears great ecological importance. The region is distinguished for its high level of endemism (unique species to one geographic area) while representing the largest area with forest cover in the country. It is also the richest region in bird and mammal species of Costa Rica, including many that are endangered.</p>
<p>From jaguars up in its mountains, to leatherback turtles nesting in beaches close to its mouth, they all depend on the habitat connectivity that the ever-flowing Pacuare River and its forests provide. These endangered marine turtles actually use the Pacuare River mouth as a major landmark to find their nesting sites. The deep and profound relation that both jaguars and leatherback turtles keep with this River are just two examples of how profoundly entangled and fragile these complex ecosystems are. We are just beginning to understand this kind of relations, and there is so much more to do and learn.</p>
<p>As important and rich this ecoregion is, it is also one with the least technical and scientific information. Generation of ecological information becomes a huge priority for the conservation of these unique and important ecosystems. Only if we know and understand it, can we manage it effectively.</p>
<p>The Talamanca Mountains also hold, among other wonders, presumably the largest jaguar population in the country. The jaguar (<i>Panthera onca</i>) is our flag, not only for how passionate we feel towards the species and all its symbolic nature, but also for what it represents in the region and the immeasurable importance concerning its conservation. The jaguar is the largest cat in the Americas, it has an enormous cultural value, and among the thousands of threatened species of plants and animals in Costa Rica, the jaguar is without doubt one of the most charismatic, surprising, and majestic. Today, even after so many years, the jaguar retains many of its ancient symbolic meanings and has become gradually, and according to many scientists, an indicator of forest richness and health, which highlights its importance over other species and its role in the balance of entire ecosystems.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542930884/s3et3jmhhu58xydfu7ed.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Talamanca jaguar has been an important element in ancient culture cosmology and in the life of rural communities in the region, with which it has coexisted for centuries; however, in recent decades this friendly relationship has changed. This region, as many others around the globe, is experiencing a critical situation in terms of natural resource management. Every day, jaguars, and all wildlife, face major threats: from habitat destruction and poaching, to road collisions, pollution, lack of environmental policies or its enforcement and low education – it is a long and sad list of threats. The Pacuare River itself faces major threats, as particular economic groups are interested in damming the River for the generation of electricity and are well advanced in their intentions. In addition, jaguars are very elusive animals and are among the least studied felids in the world. Even the most basic information such as their reproduction and habitat preference remain to be completely understood. The lack of basic scientific research and species/ecosystem management techniques are serious constraints to address jaguar conservation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542931020/yyrwgnxj8iogshpibq8r.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542931086/zxgrwrj2fep0fq5z5qp8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Fortunately, there are many who share our vision. There are a number of individual groups and organizations working tirelessly to protect jaguars through research and/or education programs, but many of these <strong>efforts are coming from groups and organizations outside this region</strong> - just imagine what we could accomplish if we were all to pool our ideas, resources, and expertise and work together from within our region for the greater benefit of jaguars.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we are endeavoring to create the <strong><i>Talamanca Jaguar Station (TAJA Station)</i></strong> – a conservation initiative that will serve as an instrument to address all these issues <strong>from within</strong> this very important ecoregion. We will bring together all people, partners, and institutions working regionally with jaguars to achieve lasting conservation solutions. We want to lead conservation efforts towards filling gaps in forest protection, as well as gaps in research and information, education, habitat restoration, and training while fostering new alternatives and opportunities for economic development in the Pacuare river basin. We have the jaguar as our guide and emblem on this endeavor. Our work will aim at opening new perspectives in research, looking for viable alternatives to address this region’s environmental and socioeconomic needs in the short term. Also, to seize the opportunity to positively influence public economic and social development policies as well as legislative frameworks of models that privilege biodiversity conservation that will result in the permanence of the most charismatic of our tropical forest species, the jaguar.</p>
<p>The aim of the <i>TAJA Station</i> will not be to rescue jaguars, but rather to prevent them from needing rescue in the first place. While other groups will perform the necessary triage, we will work on curing the root cause of the problems.</p>
<p>Building on the success of this project, <i>TAJA Station</i> will seek to be a connected and capable <strong>facilitator for scientific research</strong>, bringing scientists together to gain an understanding of the fundamental processes that govern tropical ecosystems and corridor ecology through basic and applied research. We want to provide <strong>physical facilities</strong> (accommodation, major instrumentation, and study and conference rooms) and services (logistical support) that enable scientists to operate effectively in our region. We also have a more specific interest in fostering socially impactful projects and studies -in addition to science purely for conservation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542931421/uydelt0tzvdokiybjfyz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The first step to help jaguars is protecting all remaining natural ecosystems and working to maintain and increase functional connectivity between them. This is the cornerstone of modern conservation efforts. Ave Sol is located within what has been part of the historical and geological connection between what are now two major Biosphere Reserves (declared by UNESCO) – the Central Volcanic and La Amistad Biosphere Reserves, which in time are priority areas for jaguar conservation in America. This region/connection is recognized as the Barbilla Biological Corridor. Being located in this region gives us the great opportunity, and at the same time the obligation, of facilitating gene flow between not only jaguar populations, but also of countless wildlife species.</p>
<p>It is easy to say, but this is a very complex field requiring strong cooperation with many different groups from tour operators and other business, universities and other educational institutions, to government agencies, NGO's, and local rural and Indigenous communities. Committing to conservation requires working closely with the people on all stages. Fostering this level of cooperation is our ambitious long-term goal.</p>
<p>We believe in environmental education as one of the best tools to create a cultural shift towards environmental sustainability. We currently pursue this through our educational field trip program where our guests become field researchers for the day. We acknowledge that our education program is a small step towards a major goal, and we are poised and ready to expand this program as our resources and network grow. There are some important challenges our communities face on a local level to balance economic growth with long-term sustainability. Targeted education projects will play an important part in moving forward. We are very thankful to you, who empower us to pursue these programs with your patronage.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542931745/dy9fttd4heplsft04kkh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The <strong>key missions</strong> of the <i>Talamanca Jaguar Station</i> will be:</p>
<p>• To generate holistic forms of <strong>environmentally sustainable tourism</strong> by involving science, environmental education, and tourism with the cultural context of the region.</p>
<p>• To promote the <strong>protection of the natural ecosystems of the region</strong>, as well as innovative participatory mechanisms for the protection of forests.</p>
<p>• To <strong>fund and coordinate high quality research</strong> into the biology, ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology of jaguars; same as to provide the tools to generate scientific-technical information relevant to the conservation of all biodiversity and the socioeconomic well-being of people within the region.</p>
<p>• To tackle the issues that jaguars are facing in the wild by <strong>developing and implementing conservation strategies</strong>, working from the ground up through education of local communities to lobbying for change at a government level.</p>
<p>• To create <strong>development alternatives for local people</strong> to generate economic income while promoting conservation of natural ecosystems at a regional level.</p>
<p>Each of the objectives of the <i>TAJA Station</i> represents a work axis within this initiative. These are transversal work axes, since none is independent of the others. The work axes of the <i>TAJA Station</i> are the following:</p>
<p><strong>• Sustainable tourism</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Forest Protection</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Scientific Research</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Environmental Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Technical Training</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Sustainable Development</strong></p>
<p>To fulfill the objectives of the <i>TAJA Station</i>, we intend to implement various <strong>environmental programs and key projects</strong>. Such conservation strategies include (for example): education programs in local communities; creating sustainable opportunities for local people; planting forest corridors to connect fragmented habitats; farm reforestation and habitat restoration projects, construction of wildlife bridges across major roads; volunteering programs; wildlife monitoring programs within the Barbilla Biological Corridor and the Pacuare river basin; funding scientific research, education programs to reduce poaching of jaguar prey species; and training in sustainable economic activities.</p>
<p>Beyond all historical, cultural, and ethical reasons, the value of wildlife lies in the role it plays on our own subsistence. The results of the work done over the years with the jaguar as a guide, strengthen the idea of seeing it as a key element for designing strategies for its habitat and biological corridor conservation in order to maintain, in a sustainable way, this natural wealth for the benefit of local communities, and prevent the loss of countless regional and global environmental benefits.</p>
<p>Meeting these goals will be a challenge, but as my track record shows, if I believe in something then I will throw my heart and soul into it. I believe that by working together as a united front, we will have the power to secure a brighter future for jaguars in Costa Rica.</p>

<h3>Where Your Money Will Go</h3>
<p>All the money raised through this fundraiser will go directly towards <strong>providing basic facilities to carry quality research and targeted education programs</strong> in this very important ecoregion.</p>
<p>Ave Sol River Sanctuary is a nature lodge and reserve with simple cabin accommodations in the heart of the Pacuare river basin. It was first constructed by hand and can accommodate 22 guests. It has no electricity - it is remote, rustic, and blends into the surrounding wilderness. It is how you might picture Costa Rica before exploration. This is all great for tourists that want a place to disconnect from the noise of modern life and get back in touch with nature, but these are not the best conditions to host researchers wanting to study this region.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542932197/w0emaqxszv7myhz0ttgd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nowadays, scientists need as little as electricity, basic technological and measure tools, access to the internet, and a space for experimental design and data analysis to carry out quality research. This is exactly what we want to achieve with this campaign.</p>
<p>It is simple; Ave Sol needs a little hook into the grid, but in a very clean and sustainable way. As part of our vision is the rational use of all natural resources, with your help, Ave Sol will generate its own clean and sustainable energy by installing a very simple and low-maintenance, though efficient <strong>hydroelectric system</strong> highly suited for Ave Sol’s conditions - numerous water springs and steep slopes.</p>
<p>Ave Sol will also produce its own gas from properly disposing all organic wastes into a <strong>biogas digester system</strong>. Instead of using the traditional and pollutant sceptic systems commonly found elsewhere, through the anaerobic digestion of biodegradable material, Ave Sol will transform its wastes into biogas and organic compost. Biogas that will be serve many purposes as a much cleaner and less pollutant alternative to fossil fuels, and compost that will be used to grow organic crops for local consumption.</p>
<p>We also want to provide the space and basic tools to carry out research and education in Ave Sol. With your help, we will build this space in Ave Sol; it will be known as the <strong>Jaguar Hall</strong>. It will be equipped with desktop computers, video projector, and access to the internet. For this endeavor, we will use sustainably harvested timber from our own reserve - as all current buildings found in Ave Sol; and employ local Indigenous people to help improve their economy.</p>
<p>This building will be a 100+ m<sup>2</sup> circular room that will resemble a traditional Cabecar ‘cosmic house’ – traditional Cabecar construction with great symbolical value. The Cabecar people have lived in Talamanca for thousands of years. With this, we want to give tribute to the original people of Talamanca, the Indigenous Cabecar; the people of the forest; the people of the jaguar.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542932388/psnvp5uebiw4wnapao7f.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542932445/hmvgomcahtzi0xdzfzg2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are privileged to have Cabecar families as our neighbors – the Nairi-Awari Indigenous Reserve. The Cabecar community represents one of the largest ethnic groups in Costa Rica. Its people has retained much of their culture and traditions. They are characterized by a system of beliefs and defined rules based in origin on respect for nature, principle that we not only share but also want to promote and multiply through the <i>TAJA Station</i>.</p>
<p>They live in relatively isolated communities with little or no access at all to basic services such as telephone, electricity, water, and public transportation. They also have little or no access to outside markets. These conditions have led to an external dependency mainly with government subsidies. One of our priorities will be to create development opportunities and alternatives for their people to generate income and promote the conservation of their home, the natural ecosystems of Talamanca. The <i>TAJA Station</i> tends to help Cabecar families through the implementation of a series of sustainable development projects that will improve rural community tourism in Cabecar settlements, offer direct employment to Cabecar men and women, help in their education, and preserve their traditions.</p>
<p>One of the projects that with your help we will be promoting is the <strong>Cabecar Souvenir Shop</strong>. Directed towards Cabecar women, we want to provide the space and facilities for Cabecar families to sell their pieces of Indigenous art and other traditional crafts to all of Ave Sol’s guests. In this way, we want to contribute with their income while helping preserve their traditions through the expression of their arts and crafts. We strongly believe that by giving women greater opportunities to participate in the economy, the benefits extend far beyond individual girls and women but also to societies and economies as a whole. Addressing gender gaps in accessing economic opportunities is not just the right thing to do from a human rights perspective; it is also smart economics.</p>
<p>In addition, we want to bring more and more visitors to Indigenous communities. <strong>Improving visitation to the Indigenous Reserve </strong>translates in more opportunities to help its people. Visitors get the chance to experience the Cabecar culture, preserved over thousands of years, and learn about some of their modern challenges while bringing support to local families. For example, if desired, people will have the option to carry basic food, health, or school supplies while visiting the children’s school in a Cabecar community. We will provide food / health /school supply packs for every visit we do to the community. The initial number of packs that we will buy depends entirely upon how much money we raise through this fundraiser. We intend to keep funding our <strong>Cabecar Aid Program</strong> with part of the utilities raised through Ave Sol’s visitation.</p>

<p>Improving visitation to the Indigenous Reserve is crucial. W<strong>e need to improve the Ave Sol-Awari Rainforest Trail</strong>. Not only that we want the trail to be safe and in good condition anyone to use it, but also we want it to be an environmental education tool by itself. It will provide self-guided quality information that seeks to make walking to the Indigenous Reserve a complete learning and environmental awareness experience. This can achieved with the help of the <strong><i>TAJA Station</i> Volunteer Program</strong>.</p>
<p>By its very nature, volunteerism is an important vehicle for sustainable development. Social cohesion and trust is strengthened through individual and collective volunteer action, leading to sustainable outcomes for people, by people.

</div></div>","My name is Gustavo Castro and I am a biologist working as scientific director at Ave Sol River Sanctuary. I have been studying jaguars for some years now and currently I am working in this region for my MSc thesis project, under the supervision of the International Institute for Wildlife Conservation and Management at the Costa Rican National University.
Working in this region for the last seven years has brought me close to its great ecological importance and its incredible biodiversity. It has also brought me close to its people and the needs and problems they face everyday. I realize that there is much to do to help safeguard the future of the region's natural ecosystems and its people, and for this reason, we ask for your help in exchange of any of our unique and exciting perks.
Who We Are
Ave Sol River Sanctuary is a very secluded mountain/river lodge and natural reserve located in the Pacuare River, within the Talamanca Mountain Range, home of the country’s largest forested area. Ave Sol was first acquired and built ten years ago by my best friend, Álvaro Farías (aka Natu). Natu and I grew up together in the most biodiverse country (per square meter) in the world, Costa Rica. We both grew very close with nature, which soon became our greatest interest. I became a biologist and he became a professional naturalist and river guide. As a river guide, Natu fell in love with the Pacuare River and its exuberant tropical rainforests. He felt the need to give something back to the River and this is how, with very little resources, he managed to buy this land to preserve its wildlife and forests for the benefit of all future generations. I believe Natu is a true dreamer, the visionary and hands-on dream kind. I also believe that every major achievement starts as somebody’s dream.
He wanted to share the feeling of closeness with nature this place inspires with everybody. He believes that the more people come to know and love the Pacuare River and its forests, the more strength we gain to care for it, allowing it to flow powerful and free. This is how Ave Sol was raised in the year 2007, with the goal of protecting these invaluable ecosystems and supporting conservation efforts within this unique River basin. A River basin that serves as a very important life corridor that extends from the foothills of Costa Rica’s highest peaks (>12000 ft.) all the way to the Caribbean Sea. As it turns out, the Pacuare is among the last free-flowing, healthy, and mostly clean rivers that remain in the tropics. Maintaining its ecosystems and keeping the River flowing free and clean represents the future of countless wildlife species in this region.
We want to seize the great opportunity to help mitigate some critical environmental issues affecting a region with such ecological importance. A region that is constantly been threatened by particular interests such as the damming of the Pacuare and heavy poaching. For this journey, we have set up a team of professionals in biology, management of natural resources, veterinary, health and wellness, and tourism.


Why We Need Your Help
Tropical rainforests are among the richest and most productive ecosystems in the world, and this region of Costa Rica in particular bears great ecological importance. The region is distinguished for its high level of endemism (unique species to one geographic area) while representing the largest area with forest cover in the country. It is also the richest region in bird and mammal species of Costa Rica, including many that are endangered.
From jaguars up in its mountains, to leatherback turtles nesting in beaches close to its mouth, they all depend on the habitat connectivity that the ever-flowing Pacuare River and its forests provide. These endangered marine turtles actually use the Pacuare River mouth as a major landmark to find their nesting sites. The deep and profound relation that both jaguars and leatherback turtles keep with this River are just two examples of how profoundly entangled and fragile these complex ecosystems are. We are just beginning to understand this kind of relations, and there is so much more to do and learn.
As important and rich this ecoregion is, it is also one with the least technical and scientific information. Generation of ecological information becomes a huge priority for the conservation of these unique and important ecosystems. Only if we know and understand it, can we manage it effectively.
The Talamanca Mountains also hold, among other wonders, presumably the largest jaguar population in the country. The jaguar (Panthera onca) is our flag, not only for how passionate we feel towards the species and all its symbolic nature, but also for what it represents in the region and the immeasurable importance concerning its conservation. The jaguar is the largest cat in the Americas, it has an enormous cultural value, and among the thousands of threatened species of plants and animals in Costa Rica, the jaguar is without doubt one of the most charismatic, surprising, and majestic. Today, even after so many years, the jaguar retains many of its ancient symbolic meanings and has become gradually, and according to many scientists, an indicator of forest richness and health, which highlights its importance over other species and its role in the balance of entire ecosystems.

The Talamanca jaguar has been an important element in ancient culture cosmology and in the life of rural communities in the region, with which it has coexisted for centuries; however, in recent decades this friendly relationship has changed. This region, as many others around the globe, is experiencing a critical situation in terms of natural resource management. Every day, jaguars, and all wildlife, face major threats: from habitat destruction and poaching, to road collisions, pollution, lack of environmental policies or its enforcement and low education – it is a long and sad list of threats. The Pacuare River itself faces major threats, as particular economic groups are interested in damming the River for the generation of electricity and are well advanced in their intentions. In addition, jaguars are very elusive animals and are among the least studied felids in the world. Even the most basic information such as their reproduction and habitat preference remain to be completely understood. The lack of basic scientific research and species/ecosystem management techniques are serious constraints to address jaguar conservation.


Fortunately, there are many who share our vision. There are a number of individual groups and organizations working tirelessly to protect jaguars through research and/or education programs, but many of these efforts are coming from groups and organizations outside this region - just imagine what we could accomplish if we were all to pool our ideas, resources, and expertise and work together from within our region for the greater benefit of jaguars.
For these reasons, we are endeavoring to create the Talamanca Jaguar Station (TAJA Station) – a conservation initiative that will serve as an instrument to address all these issues from within this very important ecoregion. We will bring together all people, partners, and institutions working regionally with jaguars to achieve lasting conservation solutions. We want to lead conservation efforts towards filling gaps in forest protection, as well as gaps in research and information, education, habitat restoration, and training while fostering new alternatives and opportunities for economic development in the Pacuare river basin. We have the jaguar as our guide and emblem on this endeavor. Our work will aim at opening new perspectives in research, looking for viable alternatives to address this region’s environmental and socioeconomic needs in the short term. Also, to seize the opportunity to positively influence public economic and social development policies as well as legislative frameworks of models that privilege biodiversity conservation that will result in the permanence of the most charismatic of our tropical forest species, the jaguar.
The aim of the TAJA Station will not be to rescue jaguars, but rather to prevent them from needing rescue in the first place. While other groups will perform the necessary triage, we will work on curing the root cause of the problems.
Building on the success of this project, TAJA Station will seek to be a connected and capable facilitator for scientific research, bringing scientists together to gain an understanding of the fundamental processes that govern tropical ecosystems and corridor ecology through basic and applied research. We want to provide physical facilities (accommodation, major instrumentation, and study and conference rooms) and services (logistical support) that enable scientists to operate effectively in our region. We also have a more specific interest in fostering socially impactful projects and studies -in addition to science purely for conservation.

The first step to help jaguars is protecting all remaining natural ecosystems and working to maintain and increase functional connectivity between them. This is the cornerstone of modern conservation efforts. Ave Sol is located within what has been part of the historical and geological connection between what are now two major Biosphere Reserves (declared by UNESCO) – the Central Volcanic and La Amistad Biosphere Reserves, which in time are priority areas for jaguar conservation in America. This region/connection is recognized as the Barbilla Biological Corridor. Being located in this region gives us the great opportunity, and at the same time the obligation, of facilitating gene flow between not only jaguar populations, but also of countless wildlife species.
It is easy to say, but this is a very complex field requiring strong cooperation with many different groups from tour operators and other business, universities and other educational institutions, to government agencies, NGO's, and local rural and Indigenous communities. Committing to conservation requires working closely with the people on all stages. Fostering this level of cooperation is our ambitious long-term goal.
We believe in environmental education as one of the best tools to create a cultural shift towards environmental sustainability. We currently pursue this through our educational field trip program where our guests become field researchers for the day. We acknowledge that our education program is a small step towards a major goal, and we are poised and ready to expand this program as our resources and network grow. There are some important challenges our communities face on a local level to balance economic growth with long-term sustainability. Targeted education projects will play an important part in moving forward. We are very thankful to you, who empower us to pursue these programs with your patronage.

The key missions of the Talamanca Jaguar Station will be:
• To generate holistic forms of environmentally sustainable tourism by involving science, environmental education, and tourism with the cultural context of the region.
• To promote the protection of the natural ecosystems of the region, as well as innovative participatory mechanisms for the protection of forests.
• To fund and coordinate high quality research into the biology, ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology of jaguars; same as to provide the tools to generate scientific-technical information relevant to the conservation of all biodiversity and the socioeconomic well-being of people within the region.
• To tackle the issues that jaguars are facing in the wild by developing and implementing conservation strategies, working from the ground up through education of local communities to lobbying for change at a government level.
• To create development alternatives for local people to generate economic income while promoting conservation of natural ecosystems at a regional level.
Each of the objectives of the TAJA Station represents a work axis within this initiative. These are transversal work axes, since none is independent of the others. The work axes of the TAJA Station are the following:
• Sustainable tourism
• Forest Protection
• Scientific Research
• Environmental Education
• Technical Training
• Sustainable Development
To fulfill the objectives of the TAJA Station, we intend to implement various environmental programs and key projects. Such conservation strategies include (for example): education programs in local communities; creating sustainable opportunities for local people; planting forest corridors to connect fragmented habitats; farm reforestation and habitat restoration projects, construction of wildlife bridges across major roads; volunteering programs; wildlife monitoring programs within the Barbilla Biological Corridor and the Pacuare river basin; funding scientific research, education programs to reduce poaching of jaguar prey species; and training in sustainable economic activities.
Beyond all historical, cultural, and ethical reasons, the value of wildlife lies in the role it plays on our own subsistence. The results of the work done over the years with the jaguar as a guide, strengthen the idea of seeing it as a key element for designing strategies for its habitat and biological corridor conservation in order to maintain, in a sustainable way, this natural wealth for the benefit of local communities, and prevent the loss of countless regional and global environmental benefits.
Meeting these goals will be a challenge, but as my track record shows, if I believe in something then I will throw my heart and soul into it. I believe that by working together as a united front, we will have the power to secure a brighter future for jaguars in Costa Rica.



Where Your Money Will Go
All the money raised through this fundraiser will go directly towards providing basic facilities to carry quality research and targeted education programs in this very important ecoregion.
Ave Sol River Sanctuary is a nature lodge and reserve with simple cabin accommodations in the heart of the Pacuare river basin. It was first constructed by hand and can accommodate 22 guests. It has no electricity - it is remote, rustic, and blends into the surrounding wilderness. It is how you might picture Costa Rica before exploration. This is all great for tourists that want a place to disconnect from the noise of modern life and get back in touch with nature, but these are not the best conditions to host researchers wanting to study this region.

Nowadays, scientists need as little as electricity, basic technological and measure tools, access to the internet, and a space for experimental design and data analysis to carry out quality research. This is exactly what we want to achieve with this campaign.
It is simple; Ave Sol needs a little hook into the grid, but in a very clean and sustainable way. As part of our vision is the rational use of all natural resources, with your help, Ave Sol will generate its own clean and sustainable energy by installing a very simple and low-maintenance, though efficient hydroelectric system highly suited for Ave Sol’s conditions - numerous water springs and steep slopes.
Ave Sol will also produce its own gas from properly disposing all organic wastes into a biogas digester system. Instead of using the traditional and pollutant sceptic systems commonly found elsewhere, through the anaerobic digestion of biodegradable material, Ave Sol will transform its wastes into biogas and organic compost. Biogas that will be serve many purposes as a much cleaner and less pollutant alternative to fossil fuels, and compost that will be used to grow organic crops for local consumption.
We also want to provide the space and basic tools to carry out research and education in Ave Sol. With your help, we will build this space in Ave Sol; it will be known as the Jaguar Hall. It will be equipped with desktop computers, video projector, and access to the internet. For this endeavor, we will use sustainably harvested timber from our own reserve - as all current buildings found in Ave Sol; and employ local Indigenous people to help improve their economy.
This building will be a 100+ m2 circular room that will resemble a traditional Cabecar ‘cosmic house’ – traditional Cabecar construction with great symbolical value. The Cabecar people have lived in Talamanca for thousands of years. With this, we want to give tribute to the original people of Talamanca, the Indigenous Cabecar; the people of the forest; the people of the jaguar.

We are privileged to have Cabecar families as our neighbors – the Nairi-Awari Indigenous Reserve. The Cabecar community represents one of the largest ethnic groups in Costa Rica. Its people has retained much of their culture and traditions. They are characterized by a system of beliefs and defined rules based in origin on respect for nature, principle that we not only share but also want to promote and multiply through the TAJA Station.
They live in relatively isolated communities with little or no access at all to basic services such as telephone, electricity, water, and public transportation. They also have little or no access to outside markets. These conditions have led to an external dependency mainly with government subsidies. One of our priorities will be to create development opportunities and alternatives for their people to generate income and promote the conservation of their home, the natural ecosystems of Talamanca. The TAJA Station tends to help Cabecar families through the implementation of a series of sustainable development projects that will improve rural community tourism in Cabecar settlements, offer direct employment to Cabecar men and women, help in their education, and preserve their traditions.
One of the projects that with your help we will be promoting is the Cabecar Souvenir Shop. Directed towards Cabecar women, we want to provide the space and facilities for Cabecar families to sell their pieces of Indigenous art and other traditional crafts to all of Ave Sol’s guests. In this way, we want to contribute with their income while helping preserve their traditions through the expression of their arts and crafts. We strongly believe that by giving women greater opportunities to participate in the economy, the benefits extend far beyond individual girls and women but also to societies and economies as a whole. Addressing gender gaps in accessing economic opportunities is not just the right thing to do from a human rights perspective; it is also smart economics.
In addition, we want to bring more and more visitors to Indigenous communities. Improving visitation to the Indigenous Reserve translates in more opportunities to help its people. Visitors get the chance to experience the Cabecar culture, preserved over thousands of years, and learn about some of their modern challenges while bringing support to local families. For example, if desired, people will have the option to carry basic food, health, or school supplies while visiting the children’s school in a Cabecar community. We will provide food / health /school supply packs for every visit we do to the community. The initial number of packs that we will buy depends entirely upon how much money we raise through this fundraiser. We intend to keep funding our Cabecar Aid Program with part of the utilities raised through Ave Sol’s visitation.

Improving visitation to the Indigenous Reserve is crucial. We need to improve the Ave Sol-Awari Rainforest Trail. Not only that we want the trail to be safe and in good condition anyone to use it, but also we want it to be an environmental education tool by itself. It will provide self-guided quality information that seeks to make walking to the Indigenous Reserve a complete learning and environmental awareness experience. This can achieved with the help of the TAJA Station Volunteer Program.
By its very nature, volunteerism is an important vehicle for sustainable development. Social cohesion and trust is strengthened through individual and collective volunteer action, leading to sustainable outcomes for people, by people. Volunteerism strengthens civic engagement, safeguards social inclusion, deepens solidarity and solidifies ownership of development results. Importantly, volunteering has a ripple effect. It inspires others and advances the transformations required for our sustainable development goals to take root in communities.

</h3>
<p>Construir una <b>casa
sustentable, que sea social y económicamente viable</b> en una realidad
concreta, que sirva de modelo para la construcción de viviendas sociales. La
construcción seguirá los objetivos de: ahorrar energía, mejorar la
calidad de vida, y disminuir el impacto ambiental.

<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>¿Quiénes Somos?</b></p>
<p>Somos una pareja joven que decidimos cambiar de vida. Vendimos lo poco que teníamos en Buenos Aires y comenzamos un viaje sin tiempo por América (pueden visitar nuestro blog en <u><a href=""http://www.tiemposdeagua.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tiemposdeagua.com</a></u>). Justo antes de partir tuvimos la grata sorpresa que dentro de poco se sumaría un integrante más a nuestro viaje. Esto no hizo que se detuviera nuestra aventura sino que le dio mayor sentido. Luego de varios meses de recorrido en Argentina, Chile y Bolivia, decidimos instalarnos unos meses esperando el nacimiento de nuestra hija en las Sierras de Córdoba. Queremos aprovechar de este espacio que nos dimos para realizar un <b>proyecto útil para la comunidad</b> y estimulante personalmente. Evaluando todo lo vivido hasta ahora en el viaje, más las propias experiencias que cada uno traía de nuestro pasado, decidimos darle vida a esta nueva idea.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>¿Cómo
nace la idea?</b></p>
<p>Al poco tiempo de comenzar
nuestro viaje por America, las conversaciones acerca de las
problemáticas de cada lugar que descubríamos eran cada vez más
frecuentes. </p>
<p>A cada paso encontrábamos
<b>problemas socio-ambientales</b> que parecían tener una solución fácil, pero
probablemente era una visión desde la perspectiva de personas con
una determinada educación, consciencia ecológica o bien de un
cierto poder adquisitivo. Notamos tristemente que esas soluciones no
se aplicaban y no eran tan obvias para el lugar o la población como
nos parecía. 
</p>
<p>Por ejemplo, vivimos la
fuerte radiación solar que hay tanto en el Sur Argentino como en el
Chileno, y sin embargo la <b>energía solar</b> no es aprovechada, no vimos
casi calentadores solares. 
</p>
<p>Sentimos los <b>vientos</b>
constantes y veloces de la Patagonia, y vimos varias pequeñas
turbinas eólicas en las casas, pero estaban todas frenadas por <b>falta de mantenimiento y de información</b> de las poblaciones sobre el funcionamiento de las mismas.</p>
<p>Sufrimos el olor
nauseabundo por las calles de algunos pueblos del norte argentino, y
nos enteramos de que eran aguas sucias que estaban siendo enviadas de
forma directa y sin tratamiento al río, el mismo que sirve para el
riego y el ganado. 
</p>
<p>Vimos montañas de basura
alrededor de los pueblos en Bolivia, <b>contaminando el ambiente y los
recursos hídricos</b> y creando lugares insalubres. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Todos estos pequeños
ejemplos nos hicieron preguntarnos: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Cómo mejorar la calidad de vida de los latinoamericanos? </b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Cómo aprovechar los recursos naturales de nuestro continente? </b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Cómo
vivir en mejor armonía con nuestro entorno y limitar el impacto
ambiental?</b><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>De a poco la idea
comenzaba a gestarse, y al llegar a las sierras de Córdoba,
instalarnos y saber que por algunos meses ya no viajaríamos, nos
pusimos a pensar en lo que podíamos hacer hasta que nazca nuestra
hija. También reflexionamos sobre nuestra nueva <b>responsabilidad</b>, y a
qué mundo queríamos traer a nuestra hija. Pensamos en la pregunta
que nos podría hacer ella en algún momento: <b>“ Y ustedes qué
hicieron por cambiar algo? Sólo observaron y criticaron?“</b> <b>Creemos
que debemos actuar</b>, y ahora tenemos la suerte de habernos dado el
tiempo para poder hacerlo. Así que qué mejor que empezar ahora
mismo!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>¿Cuál es
la solución?</b></p>
<p>Nuestra idea es construir
una <b>casa de bajo consumo energético y sustentable</b>, que sirva de
<b>modelo</b> para la construcción de viviendas sociales. Nos dimos cuenta
de que, para mejorar la calidad de vida de las personas y disminuir
el impacto ambiental, tenemos que <b>juntar las diferentes tecnologías
y practicas sustentables en un solo lugar</b>, que se pueda visitar y que sirva de inspiración para mejores
viviendas en otros lugares. 
</p>
<p>A corto plazo esta
vivienda mejora la calidad de vida de la gente, y disminuye el
impacto ambiental a futuro. Todo el proceso será documentado, desde
su comienzo hasta su finalización, y toda la información recaudada
será compartida de forma <b>gratuita</b>
y masiva <b>con la elaboración de un informe final</b>. </p>
<p>Cuando se nos presentó la
oportunidad de hacerlo realmente – ya que disponemos de tiempo y
del terreno físico – decidimos crear este proyecto demostrando que
este enfoque de sostenibilidad es viable, y que servirá de <b>base
educativa accesible a todos a largo plazo</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1321832/files/20150324093936-Comunicar_baja.jpg?1427215176"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Creemos que nuestro
proyecto va a tener éxito porque:</p>
<p>- <b>Valoramos el
conocimiento </b>que obtuvimos tanto en nuestra educación y profesión
como en nuestra experiencia de vida.</p>
<p>- <b>Conocemos el lugar y la
cultura local</b>, por lo cual nuestro proyecto estará enfocado en
brindar soluciones locales que podrán ser adaptadas a otros lugares
específicos con condiciones similares.</p>
<p>- <b>Estamos enfocados en
responder a necesidades reales</b>, y no solo impresiones. A lo largo de
nuestro viaje consultamos a las comunidades sobre sus necesidades, y
confirmaremos la información recaudada con una primera fase de
investigación, parte esencial en nuestro proyecto. Las soluciones
brindadas estarán adaptadas a la población, para su mejor
aceptación.</p>
<p><b>- Somos curiosos e
innovadores</b>, y estamos convencidos que este proyecto tiene un
potencial que puede ser valorizado tecnológicamente y
económicamente.
</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">¿Qué
criterios tomamos para el proyecto?</b><br/></p>
<p><b>- Una casa
económica</b>. Necesitamos una casa que
sea lo más accesible económicamente, ya que vimos en muchos lugares
la falta de viviendas. 
</p>
<p><b>- Una casa simple.</b> Esta vivienda estará
adaptada a la población que la podría habitar, evitando cambios
culturales drásticos. Las tecnologías implantadas tienen que
mantenerse simples de uso y adaptadas a la comunidad, para que tenga
una mayor aceptación social.</p>
<p><b>- Poco
mantenimiento necesario. </b>La vivienda y
sus tecnologías deben requerir el mínimo mantenimiento
especializado posible, en caso contrario existe el riesgo de que
dejen de funcionar pronto.</p>
<p><b>- Eficiencia
energética.</b> El objetivo es reducir los
gastos energéticos para minimizar el impacto ambiental y disminuir
los costos de mantenimiento. (Ejemplo: Colectores solares,
orientación incorporando conceptos bioclimaticos)</p>
<p><b>- Racionalización
y reuso de agua</b>. Con sistemas de
filtrado, mecanismos de ahorro de agua (grifería, difusores
incorporados, inodoros con doble descarga...), reutilización de aguas
grises, y otros sistemas de reuso apropiados. 
</p>
<p><b>- Minimizar los
desechos.</b> Logrando producir menos
desechos y reutilizar los mismos, reduciremos el impacto ambiental de
la vivienda. Los residuos serán separados entre inorgánicos y
orgánicos, reciclando estos últimos en composteras. El compost
obtenido será utilizado en la
huerta orgánica, que estará integrada a la casa de una manera
funcional, estética y proporcionará gran parte de los vegetales
frescos que se consumen durante todo el año. 
</p>
<p><b>-
Sustentabilidad.</b> La idea principal es
que la construccion y estas practicas sean durables en el tiempo, y
que se adapten a la poblacion como algo cotidiano.</p>
<p><b>- Un modelo
reproducible. </b>Nuestra visión es que
este proyecto sirva como modelo para la construcción de nuevas
viviendas y barrios sustentables, que se pueda reproducir y adaptar a
diferentes escalas y en distintas localidades. La justificación de
cada decisión es clave para poder adaptar este modelo a otros
lugares, acorde con el clima, la población y los materiales
disponibles. </p>
<p>No estamos hablando forzosamente de tecnologías muy
sofisticadas y costosas, sino pequeñas mejoras constructivas y
practicas fácilmente implementables para reducir consumo, impacto
ambiental, y mejorar significativamente calidad de vida.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">¿Cómo
empezar?</b><br/></p>
<p>Fue uno de los grandes
interrogantes, poder concentrar mucha información procesarla y
arrancar el proyecto no es nada sencillo. Comenzamos investigando de
forma general los diferentes métodos de ahorro de energía y de
producción de la misma de la forma más eficiente y menos
contaminante posible. Averiguamos sistemas de tratamiento y reuso de
aguas, y los tiempos aproximados necesarios para la construcción de
una vivienda en esta zona. Para quedarnos en un proyecto muy
concreto, decidimos igualmente preguntar a la comunidad local cuáles
eran sus mayores problemáticas. Definimos cuales eran los criterios claves que proporcionan un marco para el proyecto. </p>
<p>Así con esta
información reunida, más nuestras propias experiencias decidimos
dar el siguiente paso y buscar la manera de financiar semejante
sueño. Si buscamos una solución que termine siendo un servicio a la
comunidad, que mejor que apelar a ella para lograrlo: ahí es cuando
nos dirigimos hacia el Crowfunding. Creemos que <b>esta plataforma para
recaudar fondos y dar a conocer nuestro proyecto se acerca mucho a la
idea comunitaria</b> que poseemos. Esperamos conseguir colaboradores con
los mismos valores y preocupaciones que nosotros, que compartan
nuestra visión y nos ayuden a ayudar. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>¿Cómo se
va a desarrollar el proyecto? </b>
</p>
<p>En esta primer etapa
toda nuestra energía está enfocada en darle <b>difusión,
conseguir los fondos</b>, y paralelamente
seguir investigando. 
</p>
<p>Esta investigación
que ya empezó hace un tiempo, reúne en un principio datos del tipo
de terreno que poseemos, el clima de la zona, los recursos naturales
disponibles, el acceso al agua y a los servicios básicos, en fin
todo el relevamiento de las <b>condiciones
iniciales locales</b>. 
</p>
<p>Luego será la hora
de buscar la <b>solución más adecuada</b>
posible a estas condiciones, siempre basándonos en nuestros
<b>criterios</b>
antes mencionados. Esto incluye la investigación minuciosa de las
tecnologías aplicables, los materiales disponibles en la zona, el
pedido de presupuestos, entre otras.</p>
<p>Cada etapa del
proceso será documentada. Una vez que tengamos los resultados y las
<b>decisiones tomadas</b>,
será la etapa de la compra de los materiales para luego comenzar la
<b>construcción</b>
de la vivienda. 
</p>
<p>Una vez terminada la
vivienda, ya habiendo sido probada y solucionado los diferentes
problemas que se podrían presentar, nos dedicaremos a la difusión
adecuada para reproducirla en otros lugares. Esta última etapa es
tal vez la más importante, ya que nuestro objetivo final es
demostrar que se puede construir una <b>vivienda
económica, ecológica y sustentable</b>, y
<b>compartir la información</b>.
Además, no sólo queremos dejar los datos para acceso libre, sino
realmente educar a las personas, dar charlas sobre el proyecto y
sobre la factibilidad de reproducirlo.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>¿Cómo
colaborar?</b></p>
<p>Una gran ayuda es el
aporte económico por medio del Crowfunding, pero no menos importante
son esos aportes que no se pueden medir con dinero. Todos pueden
ayudarnos con:</p>
<p>- Enviarnos información de utilidad
acerca de tecnologías aplicadas en otros lugares</p>
<p>- La difusión del proyecto</p>
<p>- Una palabra o mail de aliento, una
crítica constructiva</p>
<p>- Sumarse como voluntario tanto para la
hora de la mano de obra como para la comunicación</p>
<p>En
fin, es un proyecto ambicioso y es mucho el trabajo, pero estamos
convencidos que juntos lo podemos lograr. Toda colaboración e ideas
son bienvenidas!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>¿Por qué
apoyarnos?</b></p>
<p>Tenemos una gran
convicción y determinación para realizar este sueño. Muchas veces
en nuestra vida - y especialmente en este último tiempo - han
considerado que lo que emprendíamos era una locura, pero al ver los
buenos resultados nos han comenzado a apoyar. Sabemos adaptarnos a
las situaciones y somos flexibles ante una nueva oportunidad, como la
que nos presenta hoy la vida. <b>Seamos
Realistas, Hagamos lo Imposible</b></p>

</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>À
Propos De Nous</b></p>
<p>Nous
sommes un jeune couple qui a décidé de changer de vie. Nous avons
vendu le peu de choses que nous avions à Buenos Aires et commencé
un voyage sans limite de temps en Amérique latine (vous pouvez
visiter notre blog sur <a href=""http://www.tiemposdeagua.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tiemposdeagua.com</a>). Juste avant de partir,
nous avons eu l'agréable surprise que bientôt nous allions
accueillir un autre membre qui ferait partie du voyage. Cela n'a pas
empêché notre aventure, et au contraire lui a donné plus de sens.
Après plusieurs mois de voyage en Argentine, Chili et Bolivie, nous
avons décidé de nous installer quelques mois en attendant la
prochaine naissance de notre fille dans les montagnes de Córdoba.
Nous voulons profiter de cet espace que nous nous sommes accordés
pour réaliser un projet stimulant et utile à la communauté. Apres
l’évaluation de tout ce que nous avons vécu jusqu'à présent
lors de notre voyage, nous avons décidé de donner vie à cette
nouvelle idée.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Comment
est née l'idée?</b></p>
<p>Peu
de temps après le début de notre voyage, les conversations sur les
problèmes particuliers à chaque lieu que nous découvrions se
faisaient de plus en plus fréquentes. En partie parce que nous
étions ensemble jour et nuit, et parce que nous étions très ouverts
et sensibles à tout ce qui se passait autour de nous.</p>
<p>A
chaque endroit, nous avons trouvé des problèmes sociaux et environnementaux qui semblaient
avoir une solution facile, mais il s'agissait probablement d'une
vision du point de vue de personnes avec une certaine éducation, une
conscience écologique ou bien un certain pouvoir d'achat. Nous avons
malheureusement constaté que ces solutions ne sont pas appliquées
et ne sont pas aussi évidentes aux yeux des habitants. 
</p>
<p>Par
exemple, nous avons vécu le fort ensoleillement dans le sud de
l’Argentine et du Chili, et pourtant l'énergie solaire n'est point
exploitée: nous n'avons pas vu de chauffe-eau solaires.</p>
<p>Nous
avons senti les vents constants de la Patagonie, et nous avons vu par
endroits l’installation de petites éoliennes dans les maisons,
mais elles étaint toutes à l’arrêt. Lorsque nous avons interrogé
les habitants sur l’état des éoliennes, leur réponse fut:
“Elles ont été installées il y a deux ans, mais elles ne
fonctionnent plus. Il parait que nous faisons mauvais usage des
batteries, mais on ne sait pas vraiment comment cela fonctionne.
Maintenant, nous attendons que quelqu'un vienne fixer l'installation
car le système est verrouillé et ne peut être touché que par un
expert "".</p>
<p>Nous
avons souffert des odeurs nauséabondes des rues de certaines villes
dans le nord de l'Argentine, et avons découvert qu'il s'agissait des
égouts qui étaient directement déversés sans traitement vers le
fleuve, qui était lui-même utilisé pour l'irrigation et l'élevage.</p>
<p>Nous
avons vu des décharges d'ordures en plein air autour des villages en
Bolivie, polluant l'environnement ainsi que les ressources hydriques,
et créant des lieux insalubres.</p>
<p>Tous
ces petits exemples nous ont fait réfléchir et nous demander : </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Comment améliorer la
qualité de vie des communautés en Amérique latine? </b></li>
<li><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Comment
profiter et protéger les ressources naturelles de notre continent? </b></li>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Comment limiter l'impact sur l'environnement?</b><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Petit
à petit, l'idée a commencé à prendre forme, et lorsque nous nous
sommes installés dans les montagnes de Cordoba, sachant que nous
n'allions plus voyager pendant quelques mois, nous avons commencé à
réfléchir à ce que nous pourrions faire jusqu'à la naissance de
notre fille. Nous avons également songé à notre nouvelle
responsabilité, et quel monde nous voulions pour notre fille. Nous
avons pensé a la question qu'elle pourrait nous poser à un certain
moment: <b>""Et vous, qu'avez-vous fait pour changer les choses?
Vous êtez-vous limité à observer et à critiquer?"" Nous
croyons que nous devons agir</b>, et aujourd’hui nous avons la chance
de nous avoir donné le temps de le faire. Il est temps d'agir,
commençons des maintenant!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Quelle
est la solution?</b></p>
<p>Notre
idée est de construire une maison à faible consommation
énergétique, durable, qui servira de modèle pour la construction
de logements sociaux. Nous avons réalisé que, afin d'améliorer la
qualité de vie et réduire l'impact environnemental, nous devons
rassembler les différentes technologies et pratiques durables en un
seul endroit: dans une maison qui serve de modèle, qui puisse être
visitée et qui soit une source d'inspiration pour de meilleurs
logements.</p>
<p>L'ensemble
du processus sera documenté, du début jusqu'à la fin, et toute
information recueillie sera partagée gratuitement.</p>
<p>Lorsque
l'occasion de réaliser ce projet nous est apparue concrètement –
étant donné que nous avons le temps et l'espace physique - nous
avons décidé de donner vie à notre idée afin de démontrer que
cette approche de développement durable est viable, et servira de
base éducative accessible à tous à long terme.</p>
<p>Nous
espérons que notre projet sera une réussite car il repose sur les
points suivants:</p>
<p>-
La valorisation de nos connaissances obtenues autant au cours de nos
études et expériences professionnelles que personnelles.</p>
<p>-
La connaissance du lieu et de la culture locale, de sorte que notre
projet se concentrera sur la création de solutions locales qui
peuvent être adaptées à d'autres endroits spécifiques ayant des
conditions similaires.</p>
<p>-
La réponse a des besoins réels et concrets. Tout au long de notre
voyage, nous avons consulté les communautés au sujet de leurs
besoins, et nous allons confirmer les informations recueillies avec
une première phase de recherche, partie essentielle dans notre
projet. Les solutions proposées seront adaptées à la population,
afin de garantir une meilleure acceptation de celles-ci.</p>
<p>-
Nous sommes curieux et innovateurs, et nous sommes convaincus que ce
projet a un potentiel technologique et économique.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Quels
sont les critères que nous allons prendre en compte?</b></p>
<p>-
Une maison économique. Nous voulons construire une maison abordable,
car nous avons remarqué que le manque de logements et la croissance
démographique accélérée est un problème courant.</p>
<p>- Une maison simple. Ce logement sera adapté à la population qui
pourrait y vivre, en évitant des changements culturels trop
brusques. Les technologies mises en place devraient être simples à
utiliser et adaptées à la communauté, afin d'avoir une plus grande
acceptation sociale.</p>
<p>-
Entretien minimum. Afin de limiter les risques de pannes, la maison
et les technologies employées doivent avoir un entretien minimum et
éviter au mieux tout besoin d'intervention de spécialistes.</p>
<p>-
Efficacité énergétique. L'objectif est de réduire les dépenses
énergétiques pour minimiser l'impact de l'environnement et de
réduire les coûts d'entretien. (Exemple: Chauffe-eau solaires,
Orientation intégrant des concepts bioclimatiques)</p>
<p>-
Rationalisation et réutilisation de l'eau. Avec les systèmes de
filtration, dispositifs d'économie d'eau (robinets, diffuseurs
intégrés, toilettes à double chasse ...), traitement des eaux
grises, et d'autres systèmes de réutilisation appropriées.</p>
<p>-
Réduire les déchets. L'impact environnemental du logement sera
moindre si la production de déchets est réduite et s'ils sont
recyclés. Les déchets seront séparés entre inorganiques et
organiques, et ces derniers seront recyclés pour la production de
compost. Le compost obtenu sera utilisé dans le potager organique,
qui sera intégré dans la maison d'une façon pratique et
esthétique, et fournira une grande partie des légumes frais
consommés pendant l'année.</p>
<p>-
Une maison durable. L'idée principale est que la construction et les
pratiques nommées soient durables dans le temps, et adaptables à la
vie quotidienne.</p>
<p>-
Un modèle reproductible. Notre but est que ce projet soit un modèle
pour la construction de nouvelles maisons et de quartiers durables,
qui puisse se reproduire et s'adapter à différentes échelles et à
divers endroits. La justification de chaque décision est essentielle
pour adapter ce modèle à d'autres lieux, selon le climat, la
population et les matériaux disponibles. Nous ne parlons pas
nécessairement de technologies très sophistiquées et coûteuses,
mais de petites améliorations de conception, et la mise en place
d'actions facilement réalisables pour réduire la consommation,
l'impact sur l'environnement, et améliorer la qualité de vie de
manière significative.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Par
où commencer?</b></p>
<p>Ce
fut une de nos questions, rassembler des donneés et les traiter afin
de pouvoir démarrer le projet n'est pas si simple. Nous avons
commencé par faire des recherches sur les différentes méthodes
d'économie d'énergie en général, et sa production de manière
efficace et non-polluante. Nous avons découvert des systèmes de
traitement et de réutilisation de l'eau. Nous nous sommes renseignés
sur les temps approximatifs requis pour la construire d'une maison
dans cette zone. Afin de garder les pieds sur terre et de créer un
projet concret, nous avons également décidé d'en parler à nos
voisins et nous renseigner sur leurs plus grands problèmes.</p>
<p>Ainsi,
avec toutes ces informations recueillies, ajoutées a nos propres
expériences, nous avons décidé de faire le grand pas: donner un
cadre à notre projet et trouver un moyen de financer un tel rêve.
Si nous cherchons une solution qui sera un service à la communauté,
comment ne pas y faire appel afin d'atteindre cet objectif? C'est
ainsi que nous nous sommes dirigés vers le Crowdfunding. Nous
croyons que cette plate-forme pour lever des fonds et faire connaître
notre projet est très proche de l'idée d'entraide communautaire que
nous tenons. Nous espérons trouver des partenaires avec les mêmes
valeurs et préoccupations que nous, qui partagent notre vision et
nous aident à aider. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Quel
sera le déroulement du projet?</b></p>
<p>Au
cours de cette première étape, nous sommes concentrés sur la
diffusion du projet, la collecte de fonds, et la poursuite de nos
recherches.</p>
<p>Cette
recherche qui a déjà commencé il y a un certain temps, recueille
en un premier temps des données sur le type de terrain que nous
possédons, le climat local, les ressources naturelles, l'accès à
l'eau et aux services de base, afin d'étudier toutes les conditions
initiales locales.</p>
<p>Ensuite,
il sera temps de trouver la meilleure solution possible en tenant
compte de ces conditions, en gardant toujours comme repère les
critères nommés ci-dessus. Cela inclut une recherche approfondie
des technologies applicables, des matériaux disponibles dans la
région, ainsi que de la demande de devis, entre autres.</p>
<p>Chaque
étape du processus sera documentée. Suite a la synthèse des
résultats et la prise de décision, il sera temps de passer à
l'étape d'achat des matériaux et de commencer la construction de la
maison.</p>
<p>Une
fois la maison construite, après l’avoir testée et fait face aux
différents problèmes qui pourraient survenir, nous allons nous
concentrer sur la diffusion appropriée afin de reproduire ce modèle
ailleurs. Cette dernière étape est peut-être la plus importante,
car notre but ultime est de démontrer que la construction d'une
maison économique, écologique et durable est possible, et nous
allons partager toute l'information assemblée au cours du projet. De
plus, non seulement nous voulons laisser libre accès aux données,
mais réellement contribuer à l’éducation des populations, donner
des conférences sur le projet et sur sa faisabilité.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Comment
contribuer?</b></p>
<p>La
contribution économique à travers le Crowdfunding est importante,
mais toute aide non mesurable économiquement est tout aussi
essentielle. Chacun peut nous aider avec:</p>
<p>-
L'envoi d'information utile sur les technologies appliquées ailleurs</p>
<p>-
La diffusion du projet</p>
<p>-
Un mot d'encouragement, des critiques constructives</p>
<p>-
Du travail de bénévolat sur le terrain</p>
<p>Enfin,
il s'agit d'un projet ambitieux qui demande beaucoup de travail, mais
nous sommes convaincus qu'ensemble nous pouvons lui donner vie. Toute
contribution et idée sont les bienvenues!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Pourquoi
nous soutenir?</b></p>
<p>Nous
avons une grande conviction et détermination pour réaliser ce rêve.
Plusieurs fois dans nos vies - et surtout ces derniers temps – nous
avons été qualifiés de fous par les projets que nous
entreprenions. Mais en voyant les bons résultats obtenus, nous avons
commencé à être soutenus et encouragés dans nos démarches. Nous
savons nous adapter et sommes flexibles face à de nouvelles
opportunités, comme celle que la vie nous présente aujourd'hui.

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>About
Us</b></p>
<p>We
are a young couple who decided to change our life. We sold our few
possessions in Buenos Aires and began a trip in Latin America (you
can visit our blog <a href=""http://www.tiemposdeagua.com)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tiemposdeagua.com).</a> Just before leaving, we
received the wonderful news that we would soon be joined by another
companion on our trip. This did not stop our adventure, and instead
gave it more meaning. After months of travel in Argentina, Chile and
Bolivia, we have decided to move to the mountains of Cordoba for a
few months until our daughter's birth. We want to enjoy the time and
space we gave ourselves for this moment, while investing ourselves in
a stimulating and useful project for the community. After evaluating
everything we have experienced so far on our trip, we decided to give
life to this new idea. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The
source of the idea</b>
</p>
<p>Shortly
after beginning our trip around Latin America, our conversations
concerning problems in the places we were discovering became more
frequent. This was partly because we were together day and night, and especially
because we were very open and sensitive to everything happening
around us.  
</p>
<p>In
each place, we discovered problems that appeared to have an easy
solution from our perspective as educated individuals with
environmental awareness and purchasing power. Unfortunately, we have
found that these solutions are not as obvious to the local population
and are not implemented. 
</p>
<p>For
example, we felt the strong solar radiation in the south of Argentina
and Chile, and yet solar energy is not exploited: we didn't see any
solar heaters.</p>
<p>We
experienced the constant winds of Patagonia, and we saw small wind
turbines in many houses, but they were all halted. When we asked the
locals about the state of the wind turbines, their answer was: ""They
were installed about two years ago, but they don't work. It seems
that we misused the batteries, but we actually don't really know how
the system works. Now we are waiting for someone to come fix the unit
because the system is locked and only an expert can access it.""</p>
<p>We
smelled the raw sewage running through the streets of some cities in
the north of Argentina, and discovered it was directly discharged
into a river without treatment. The same river was a water resource
for irrigation and farming.</p>
<p>We
saw outdoor dumps around villages in Bolivia, polluting the
environment and water resources, and creating unsanitary areas.</p>
<p>All
these small examples  made us think and ask ourselves: ""What can
we do to change things? How can we improve the quality of life of
communities in Latin America? How can we protect and benefit from the
natural resources of our continent? How can we limit the impact on
the environment?""</p>
<p>Gradually,
our idea began to take shape, and when we moved to the mountains of
Cordoba, knowing that we would not travel for a few months, we began
to think about what we could do in the time leading up to the birth
of our daughter. We also thought of our new responsibilities and
about what kind of world we want for our daughter. We thought about
the questions she might ask: ""And what did you do to change
things? Did you limit yourself to observing and criticizing?"" We
believe that we must act, and today we are lucky enough to have given
ourselves the time to do so. It's time to act, let's begin right now!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What
is the solution?</b></p>
<p>Our
idea is to build a green, sustainable, affordable home,  that can be
a model for the construction of community housing. We realize that in
order to improve the quality of life and reduce the impact on the
environment, we need to bring together various sustainable
technologies and practices into one place: in a house that can be
visited and serve as an inspiration for better housing.</p>
<p>The
whole process will be documented and all information will be shared
online for free.</p>
<p>Now
that we have the opportunity to implement this project – as we have
time and physical space – we have decided to demonstrate that this
sustainable development approach is viable. This project will serve
as an educational base accessible to all in the long term.</p>
<p>We
believe the success of our project will be the result of our
commitment to:</p>
<p><b>-
Expertise:</b>
We value knowledge gained both through formal training and life
experience.</p>
<p><b>- </b><b>Cultural
awareness: </b>We
know the
place and local culture, so our project will focus on creating local
solutions that can be adapted to other specific locations with
similar conditions.</p>
<p><b>-
A response to real and tangible needs: </b>Throughout
our trip, we consulted with communities about their needs, and we
will confirm the information collected during the first phase of
research, which will be an essential part in our project.</p>
<p><b>-
Innovation:</b>
We are curious and innovative, and we are confident that this project
has a technological and economic potential.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What
criteria will we take into account?</b></p>
<p><b>-
An economical house. </b>We
want to build an affordable home to help with what we noticed are
common issues: lack of housing and rapid population growth.</p>
<p><b>-
Keeping it simple.</b>
This property will be tailored to the population that could live
there, avoiding abrupt cultural changes. The technologies in place
should be simple to use and suitable for the community to reach
greater social acceptance. 
</p>
<p><b>-
Minimum maintenance. </b>To
reduce the risk of failure, the house and the technologies applied
must require minimum maintenance and avoid (at best) any need of
specialist intervention.</p>
<p><b>-
Energy efficiency. </b>The
goal is to build a low-energy house, to minimize the impact of the
environment and to reduce maintenance costs (using for instance solar
water heaters and orientation integrating bioclimatic concepts).</p>
<p><b>-
Save and reuse water.</b>
With filtration systems, water saving devices (taps, integrated
diffusers, dual-flush toilets ...), greywater treatment, and other
appropriate reuse systems.</p>
<p><b>-
Reduce and recycle waste.</b>
The house's impact on the environment will be limited if the amount
of waste generated by the occupants is reduced, by providing on-site
solutions such as compost bins. Inorganic and organic waste will be
separated. The compost will be used in the organic vegetable garden,
which will be integrated into the home in a practical and aesthetic
way, and provide fresh vegetables to be consumed throughout the year.</p>
<p><b>-
A sustainable house.</b>
The main idea is that the construction and green practices are
sustainable over time and adapted to everyday life.</p>
<p><b>-
A replicable model.</b>
Our objective is to make this project a model for the construction of
new homes and sustainable neighbourhoods, which can be reproduced and
adapted to different scales and in different locations. Each decision
taken will be justified, depending on the climate, population and the
materials available . This is essential to adapt the model to other
locations.</p>
<p>We
are not necessarily talking about very sophisticated and expensive
technologies, but small design improvements and easy green practices
to reduce consumption and environmental impact, and to improve the
quality of life.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Where
do we start?</b></p>
<p>This
was one of our questions, as gathering and processing data in order
to start the project is not simple. We began by researching the
different energy saving methods in general, and their efficiency and
environmental impact. We looked at water treatment and reuse systems.
We inquired about the approximate time required to build a house in
this area. In order to keep our feet on the ground and create a
concrete project, we have also talked to our neighbours so that they
can tell us about their biggest problems.</p>
<p>With
all the information we collected, in addition to our own experiences,
we decided to take the big step: providing a framework for our
project and finding a way to finance this dream. If we’re seeking a
solution that will be of service to the community, why not ask the
community to help us reach our dream? This is how we arrived at the
idea of Crowdfunding. This platform to raise funds for our project
and spread the world is very close to our idea of community support.
We hope to find partners with the same values and concerns, who share
our vision and can help us to help. 
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What's
the plan?</b></p>
<p>During
the current <b>first
stage</b>,
we are focused on <b>communicating</b>
about the project, <b>fundraising</b>,
and our <b>research</b>.</p>
<p>This
research, which began a while ago, starts by exploring the data on
<b>initial
local conditions:</b>
type of land, local climate, natural resources, access to water and
basic services.</p>
<p>Then
it will be time to find the <b>most
suitable solutions</b>
in the light of these initial conditions, always keeping in mind the
<b>criteria</b>
listed above. This includes a thorough research of the applicable
technologies, of the materials available in the region, and of the
cost of those technologies, in order to ensure the project remains
affordable.  
</p>
<p><b>Each
stage will be documented</b>.
After a summary of the results and decision making, it will be time
to take the next step: purchasing materials and starting the
construction of the house.</p>
<p>Once
the house is built, after testing and facing different problems that
may arise, we will focus on the appropriate way of sharing all the
information gathered in order to <b>replicate
this model elsewhere</b>.
This last step is perhaps the most important, because our ultimate
goal is to <b>demonstrate
that the construction of an ecological, economical and sustainable
home is possible</b>,
and we will share all the information gathered during the project
<b>online
for free</b>.
Furthermore, we want this project to have an educational aspect and
plan to give lectures about the project and its feasibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>How
can you contribute?</b></p>
<p>A
donation through Crowdfunding is important, but contributions which
are not economically measurable are also essential. Everyone can help
with:</p>
<p>-
Sending useful information on technologies applied elsewhere</p>
<p>-
Sharing the project! Forward this on to your friends, family and
co-workers</p>

Objetivo

Construir una casa
sustentable, que sea social y económicamente viable en una realidad
concreta, que sirva de modelo para la construcción de viviendas sociales. La
construcción seguirá los objetivos de: ahorrar energía, mejorar la
calidad de vida, y disminuir el impacto ambiental. 

Todo el proceso del
proyecto será documentado para poder difundir de forma masiva la
información recaudada desde su comienzo hasta su finalización,
facilitando la reproducción de este tipo de vivienda, respetando las
condiciones precisas de cada lugar.


¿Quiénes Somos?
Somos una pareja joven que decidimos cambiar de vida. Vendimos lo poco que teníamos en Buenos Aires y comenzamos un viaje sin tiempo por América (pueden visitar nuestro blog en www.tiemposdeagua.com). Justo antes de partir tuvimos la grata sorpresa que dentro de poco se sumaría un integrante más a nuestro viaje. Esto no hizo que se detuviera nuestra aventura sino que le dio mayor sentido. Luego de varios meses de recorrido en Argentina, Chile y Bolivia, decidimos instalarnos unos meses esperando el nacimiento de nuestra hija en las Sierras de Córdoba. Queremos aprovechar de este espacio que nos dimos para realizar un proyecto útil para la comunidad y estimulante personalmente. Evaluando todo lo vivido hasta ahora en el viaje, más las propias experiencias que cada uno traía de nuestro pasado, decidimos darle vida a esta nueva idea.




¿Cómo
nace la idea?
Al poco tiempo de comenzar
nuestro viaje por America, las conversaciones acerca de las
problemáticas de cada lugar que descubríamos eran cada vez más
frecuentes. 
A cada paso encontrábamos
problemas socio-ambientales que parecían tener una solución fácil, pero
probablemente era una visión desde la perspectiva de personas con
una determinada educación, consciencia ecológica o bien de un
cierto poder adquisitivo. Notamos tristemente que esas soluciones no
se aplicaban y no eran tan obvias para el lugar o la población como
nos parecía. 

Por ejemplo, vivimos la
fuerte radiación solar que hay tanto en el Sur Argentino como en el
Chileno, y sin embargo la energía solar no es aprovechada, no vimos
casi calentadores solares. 

Sentimos los vientos
constantes y veloces de la Patagonia, y vimos varias pequeñas
turbinas eólicas en las casas, pero estaban todas frenadas por falta de mantenimiento y de información de las poblaciones sobre el funcionamiento de las mismas.
Sufrimos el olor
nauseabundo por las calles de algunos pueblos del norte argentino, y
nos enteramos de que eran aguas sucias que estaban siendo enviadas de
forma directa y sin tratamiento al río, el mismo que sirve para el
riego y el ganado. 

Vimos montañas de basura
alrededor de los pueblos en Bolivia, contaminando el ambiente y los
recursos hídricos y creando lugares insalubres. 



Todos estos pequeños
ejemplos nos hicieron preguntarnos: 


Cómo mejorar la calidad de vida de los latinoamericanos? 


Cómo aprovechar los recursos naturales de nuestro continente? 


Cómo
vivir en mejor armonía con nuestro entorno y limitar el impacto
ambiental?


De a poco la idea
comenzaba a gestarse, y al llegar a las sierras de Córdoba,
instalarnos y saber que por algunos meses ya no viajaríamos, nos
pusimos a pensar en lo que podíamos hacer hasta que nazca nuestra
hija. También reflexionamos sobre nuestra nueva responsabilidad, y a
qué mundo queríamos traer a nuestra hija. Pensamos en la pregunta
que nos podría hacer ella en algún momento: “ Y ustedes qué
hicieron por cambiar algo? Sólo observaron y criticaron?“ Creemos
que debemos actuar, y ahora tenemos la suerte de habernos dado el
tiempo para poder hacerlo. Así que qué mejor que empezar ahora
mismo!


¿Cuál es
la solución?
Nuestra idea es construir
una casa de bajo consumo energético y sustentable, que sirva de
modelo para la construcción de viviendas sociales. Nos dimos cuenta
de que, para mejorar la calidad de vida de las personas y disminuir
el impacto ambiental, tenemos que juntar las diferentes tecnologías
y practicas sustentables en un solo lugar, que se pueda visitar y que sirva de inspiración para mejores
viviendas en otros lugares. 

A corto plazo esta
vivienda mejora la calidad de vida de la gente, y disminuye el
impacto ambiental a futuro. Todo el proceso será documentado, desde
su comienzo hasta su finalización, y toda la información recaudada
será compartida de forma gratuita
y masiva con la elaboración de un informe final. 
Cuando se nos presentó la
oportunidad de hacerlo realmente – ya que disponemos de tiempo y
del terreno físico – decidimos crear este proyecto demostrando que
este enfoque de sostenibilidad es viable, y que servirá de base
educativa accesible a todos a largo plazo.




Creemos que nuestro
proyecto va a tener éxito porque:
- Valoramos el
conocimiento que obtuvimos tanto en nuestra educación y profesión
como en nuestra experiencia de vida.
- Conocemos el lugar y la
cultura local, por lo cual nuestro proyecto estará enfocado en
brindar soluciones locales que podrán ser adaptadas a otros lugares
específicos con condiciones similares.
- Estamos enfocados en
responder a necesidades reales, y no solo impresiones. A lo largo de
nuestro viaje consultamos a las comunidades sobre sus necesidades, y
confirmaremos la información recaudada con una primera fase de
investigación, parte esencial en nuestro proyecto. Las soluciones
brindadas estarán adaptadas a la población, para su mejor
aceptación.
- Somos curiosos e
innovadores, y estamos convencidos que este proyecto tiene un
potencial que puede ser valorizado tecnológicamente y
económicamente.


¿Qué
criterios tomamos para el proyecto?
- Una casa
económica. Necesitamos una casa que
sea lo más accesible económicamente, ya que vimos en muchos lugares
la falta de viviendas. 

- Una casa simple. Esta vivienda estará
adaptada a la población que la podría habitar, evitando cambios
culturales drásticos. Las tecnologías implantadas tienen que
mantenerse simples de uso y adaptadas a la comunidad, para que tenga
una mayor aceptación social.
- Poco
mantenimiento necesario. La vivienda y
sus tecnologías deben requerir el mínimo mantenimiento
especializado posible, en caso contrario existe el riesgo de que
dejen de funcionar pronto.
- Eficiencia
energética. El objetivo es reducir los
gastos energéticos para minimizar el impacto ambiental y disminuir
los costos de mantenimiento. (Ejemplo: Colectores solares,
orientación incorporando conceptos bioclimaticos)
- Racionalización
y reuso de agua. Con sistemas de
filtrado, mecanismos de ahorro de agua (grifería, difusores
incorporados, inodoros con doble descarga...), reutilización de aguas
grises, y otros sistemas de reuso apropiados. 

- Minimizar los
desechos. Logrando producir menos
desechos y reutilizar los mismos, reduciremos el impacto ambiental de
la vivienda. Los residuos serán separados entre inorgánicos y
orgánicos, reciclando estos últimos en composteras. El compost
obtenido será utilizado en la
huerta orgánica, que estará integrada a la casa de una manera
funcional, estética y proporcionará gran parte de los vegetales
frescos que se consumen durante todo el año. 

-
Sustentabilidad. La idea principal es
que la construccion y estas practicas sean durables en el tiempo, y
que se adapten a la poblacion como algo cotidiano.
- Un modelo
reproducible. Nuestra visión es que
este proyecto sirva como modelo para la construcción de nuevas
viviendas y barrios sustentables, que se pueda reproducir y adaptar a
diferentes escalas y en distintas localidades. La justificación de
cada decisión es clave para poder adaptar este modelo a otros
lugares, acorde con el clima, la población y los materiales
disponibles. 
No estamos hablando forzosamente de tecnologías muy
sofisticadas y costosas, sino pequeñas mejoras constructivas y
practicas fácilmente implementables para reducir consumo, impacto
ambiental, y mejorar significativamente calidad de vida.

¿Cómo
empezar?
Fue uno de los grandes
interrogantes, poder concentrar mucha información procesarla y
arrancar el proyecto no es nada sencillo. Comenzamos investigando de
forma general los diferentes métodos de ahorro de energía y de
producción de la misma de la forma más eficiente y menos
contaminante posible. Averiguamos sistemas de tratamiento y reuso de
aguas, y los tiempos aproximados necesarios para la construcción de
una vivienda en esta zona. Para quedarnos en un proyecto muy
concreto, decidimos igualmente preguntar a la comunidad local cuáles
eran sus mayores problemáticas. Definimos cuales eran los criterios claves que proporcionan un marco para el proyecto. 
Así con esta
información reunida, más nuestras propias experiencias decidimos
dar el siguiente paso y buscar la manera de financiar semejante
sueño. Si buscamos una solución que termine siendo un servicio a la
comunidad, que mejor que apelar a ella para lograrlo: ahí es cuando
nos dirigimos hacia el Crowfunding. Creemos que esta plataforma para
recaudar fondos y dar a conocer nuestro proyecto se acerca mucho a la
idea comunitaria que poseemos. Esperamos conseguir colaboradores con
los mismos valores y preocupaciones que nosotros, que compartan
nuestra visión y nos ayuden a ayudar. 




¿Cómo se
va a desarrollar el proyecto? 

En esta primer etapa
toda nuestra energía está enfocada en darle difusión,
conseguir los fondos, y paralelamente
seguir investigando. 

Esta investigación
que ya empezó hace un tiempo, reúne en un principio datos del tipo
de terreno que poseemos, el clima de la zona, los recursos naturales
disponibles, el acceso al agua y a los servicios básicos, en fin
todo el relevamiento de las condiciones
iniciales locales. 

Luego será la hora
de buscar la solución más adecuada
posible a estas condiciones, siempre basándonos en nuestros
criterios
antes mencionados. Esto incluye la investigación minuciosa de las
tecnologías aplicables, los materiales disponibles en la zona, el
pedido de presupuestos, entre otras.
Cada etapa del
proceso será documentada. Una vez que tengamos los resultados y las
decisiones tomadas,
será la etapa de la compra de los materiales para luego comenzar la
construcción
de la vivienda. 

Una vez terminada la
vivienda, ya habiendo sido probada y solucionado los diferentes
problemas que se podrían presentar, nos dedicaremos a la difusión
adecuada para reproducirla en otros lugares. Esta última etapa es
tal vez la más importante, ya que nuestro objetivo final es
demostrar que se puede construir una vivienda
económica, ecológica y sustentable, y
compartir la información.
Además, no sólo queremos dejar los datos para acceso libre, sino

À
Propos De Nous
Nous
sommes un jeune couple qui a décidé de changer de vie. Nous avons
vendu le peu de choses que nous avions à Buenos Aires et commencé
un voyage sans limite de temps en Amérique latine (vous pouvez
visiter notre blog sur www.tiemposdeagua.com). Juste avant de partir,
nous avons eu l'agréable surprise que bientôt nous allions
accueillir un autre membre qui ferait partie du voyage. Cela n'a pas
empêché notre aventure, et au contraire lui a donné plus de sens.
Après plusieurs mois de voyage en Argentine, Chili et Bolivie, nous
avons décidé de nous installer quelques mois en attendant la
prochaine naissance de notre fille dans les montagnes de Córdoba.
Nous voulons profiter de cet espace que nous nous sommes accordés
pour réaliser un projet stimulant et utile à la communauté. Apres
l’évaluation de tout ce que nous avons vécu jusqu'à présent
lors de notre voyage, nous avons décidé de donner vie à cette
nouvelle idée.

Comment
est née l'idée?
Peu
de temps après le début de notre voyage, les conversations sur les
problèmes particuliers à chaque lieu que nous découvrions se
faisaient de plus en plus fréquentes. En partie parce que nous
étions ensemble jour et nuit, et parce que nous étions très ouverts
et sensibles à tout ce qui se passait autour de nous.
A
chaque endroit, nous avons trouvé des problèmes sociaux et environnementaux qui semblaient
avoir une solution facile, mais il s'agissait probablement d'une
vision du point de vue de personnes avec une certaine éducation, une
conscience écologique ou bien un certain pouvoir d'achat. Nous avons
malheureusement constaté que ces solutions ne sont pas appliquées
et ne sont pas aussi évidentes aux yeux des habitants. 

Par
exemple, nous avons vécu le fort ensoleillement dans le sud de
l’Argentine et du Chili, et pourtant l'énergie solaire n'est point
exploitée: nous n'avons pas vu de chauffe-eau solaires.
Nous
avons senti les vents constants de la Patagonie, et nous avons vu par
endroits l’installation de petites éoliennes dans les maisons,
mais elles étaint toutes à l’arrêt. Lorsque nous avons interrogé
les habitants sur l’état des éoliennes, leur réponse fut:
“Elles ont été installées il y a deux ans, mais elles ne
fonctionnent plus. Il parait que nous faisons mauvais usage des
batteries, mais on ne sait pas vraiment comment cela fonctionne.
Maintenant, nous attendons que quelqu'un vienne fixer l'installation
car le système est verrouillé et ne peut être touché que par un
expert "".
Nous
avons souffert des odeurs nauséabondes des rues de certaines villes
dans le nord de l'Argentine, et avons découvert qu'il s'agissait des
égouts qui étaient directement déversés sans traitement vers le
fleuve, qui était lui-même utilisé pour l'irrigation et l'élevage.
Nous
avons vu des décharges d'ordures en plein air autour des villages en
Bolivie, polluant l'environnement ainsi que les ressources hydriques,
et créant des lieux insalubres.
Tous
ces petits exemples nous ont fait réfléchir et nous demander : 


Comment améliorer la
qualité de vie des communautés en Amérique latine? 
Comment
profiter et protéger les ressources naturelles de notre continent? 

Comment limiter l'impact sur l'environnement?


Petit
à petit, l'idée a commencé à prendre forme, et lorsque nous nous
sommes installés dans les montagnes de Cordoba, sachant que nous
n'allions plus voyager pendant quelques mois, nous avons commencé à
réfléchir à ce que nous pourrions faire jusqu'à la naissance de
notre fille. Nous avons également songé à notre nouvelle
responsabilité, et quel monde nous voulions pour notre fille. Nous
avons pensé a la question qu'elle pourrait nous poser à un certain
moment: ""Et vous, qu'avez-vous fait pour changer les choses?
Vous êtez-vous limité à observer et à critiquer?"" Nous
croyons que nous devons agir, et aujourd’hui nous avons la chance
de nous avoir donné le temps de le faire. Il est temps d'agir,
commençons des maintenant!



Quelle
est la solution?
Notre
idée est de construire une maison à faible consommation
énergétique, durable, qui servira de modèle pour la construction
de logements sociaux. Nous avons réalisé que, afin d'améliorer la
qualité de vie et réduire l'impact environnemental, nous devons
rassembler les différentes technologies et pratiques durables en un
seul endroit: dans une maison qui serve de modèle, qui puisse être
visitée et qui soit une source d'inspiration pour de meilleurs
logements.
L'ensemble
du processus sera documenté, du début jusqu'à la fin, et toute
information recueillie sera partagée gratuitement.
Lorsque
l'occasion de réaliser ce projet nous est apparue concrètement –
étant donné que nous avons le temps et l'espace physique - nous
avons décidé de donner vie à notre idée afin de démontrer que
cette approche de développement durable est viable, et servira de
base éducative accessible à tous à long terme.
Nous
espérons que notre projet sera une réussite car il repose sur les
points suivants:
-
La valorisation de nos connaissances obtenues autant au cours de nos
études et expériences professionnelles que personnelles.
-
La connaissance du lieu et de la culture locale, de sorte que notre
projet se concentrera sur la création de solutions locales qui
peuvent être adaptées à d'autres endroits spécifiques ayant des
conditions similaires.
-
La réponse a des besoins réels et concrets. Tout au long de notre
voyage, nous avons consulté les communautés au sujet de leurs
besoins, et nous allons confirmer les informations recueillies avec
une première phase de recherche, partie essentielle dans notre
projet. Les solutions proposées seront adaptées à la population,
afin de garantir une meilleure acceptation de celles-ci.
-
Nous sommes curieux et innovateurs, et nous sommes convaincus que ce
projet a un potentiel technologique et économique.

Quels
sont les critères que nous allons prendre en compte?
-
Une maison économique. Nous voulons construire une maison abordable,
car nous avons remarqué que le manque de logements et la croissance
démographique accélérée est un problème courant.
- Une maison simple. Ce logement sera adapté à la population qui
pourrait y vivre, en évitant des changements culturels trop
brusques. Les technologies mises en place devraient être simples à
utiliser et adaptées à la communauté, afin d'avoir une plus grande
acceptation sociale.
-
Entretien minimum. Afin de limiter les risques de pannes, la maison
et les technologies employées doivent avoir un entretien minimum et
éviter au mieux tout besoin d'intervention de spécialistes.
-
Efficacité énergétique. L'objectif est de réduire les dépenses
énergétiques pour minimiser l'impact de l'environnement et de
réduire les coûts d'entretien. (Exemple: Chauffe-eau solaires,
Orientation intégrant des concepts bioclimatiques)
-
Rationalisation et réutilisation de l'eau. Avec les systèmes de
filtration, dispositifs d'économie d'eau (robinets, diffuseurs
intégrés, toilettes à double chasse ...), traitement des eaux
grises, et d'autres systèmes de réutilisation appropriées.
-
Réduire les déchets. L'impact environnemental du logement sera
moindre si la production de déchets est réduite et s'ils sont
recyclés. Les déchets seront séparés entre inorganiques et
organiques, et ces derniers seront recyclés pour la production de
compost. Le compost obtenu sera utilisé dans le potager organique,
qui sera intégré dans la maison d'une façon pratique et
esthétique, et fournira une grande partie des légumes frais
consommés pendant l'année.
-
Une maison durable. L'idée principale est que la construction et les
pratiques nommées soient durables dans le temps, et adaptables à la
vie quotidienne.
-
Un modèle reproductible. Notre but est que ce projet soit un modèle
pour la construction de nouvelles maisons et de quartiers durables,
qui puisse se reproduire et s'adapter à différentes échelles et à
divers endroits. La justification de chaque décision est essentielle
pour adapter ce modèle à d'autres lieux, selon le climat, la
population et les matériaux disponibles. Nous ne parlons pas
nécessairement de technologies très sophistiquées et coûteuses,
mais de petites améliorations de conception, et la mise en place
d'actions facilement réalisables pour réduire la consommation,
l'impact sur l'environnement, et améliorer la qualité de vie de
manière significative.









Par
où commencer?
Ce
fut une de nos questions, rassembler des donneés et les traiter afin
de pouvoir démarrer le projet n'est pas si simple. Nous avons
commencé par faire des recherches sur les différentes méthodes
d'économie d'énergie en général, et sa production de manière
efficace et non-polluante. Nous avons découvert des systèmes de
traitement et de réutilisation de l'eau. Nous nous sommes renseignés
sur les temps approximatifs requis pour la construire d'une maison
dans cette zone. Afin de garder les pieds sur terre et de créer un
projet concret, nous avons également décidé d'en parler à nos
voisins et nous renseigner sur leurs plus grands problèmes.
Ainsi,
avec toutes ces informations recueillies, ajoutées a nos propres
expériences, nous avons décidé de faire le grand pas: donner un
cadre à notre projet et trouver un moyen de financer un tel rêve.
Si nous cherchons une solution qui sera un service à la communauté,
comment ne pas y faire appel afin d'atteindre cet objectif? C'est
ainsi que nous nous sommes dirigés vers le Crowdfunding. Nous
croyons que cette plate-forme pour lever des fonds et faire connaître
notre projet est très proche de l'idée d'entraide communautaire que
nous tenons. Nous espérons trouver des partenaires avec les mêmes
valeurs et préoccupations que nous, qui partagent notre vision et
nous aident à aider. 




Quel
sera le déroulement du projet?
Au
cours de cette première étape, nous sommes concentrés sur la
diffusion du projet, la collecte de fonds, et la poursuite de nos
recherches.
Cette
recherche qui a déjà commencé il y a un certain temps, recueille
en un premier temps des données sur le type de terrain que nous
possédons, le climat local, les ressources naturelles, l'accès à
l'eau et aux services de base, afin d'étudier toutes les conditions
initiales locales.
Ensuite,
il sera temps de trouver la meilleure solution possible en tenant
compte de ces conditions, en gardant toujours comme repère les
critères nommés ci-dessus. Cela inclut une recherche approfondie
des technologies applicables, des matériaux disponibles dans la
région, ainsi que de la demande de devis, entre autres.
Chaque
étape du processus sera documentée. Suite a la synthèse des
résultats et la prise de décision, il sera temps de passer à
l'étape d'achat des matériaux et de commencer la construction de la
maison.
Une
fois la maison construite, après l’avoir testée et fait face aux
différents problèmes qui pourraient survenir, nous allons nous
concentrer sur la diffusion appropriée afin de reproduire ce modèle
ailleurs. Cette dernière étape est peut-être la plus importante,
car notre but ultime est de démontrer que la construction d'une
maison économique, écologique et durable est possible, et nous
allons partager toute l'information assemblée au cours du projet. De
plus, non seulement nous voulons laisser libre accès aux données,
mais réellement contribuer à l’éducation des populations, donner
des conférences sur le projet et sur sa faisabilité.

Comment
contribuer?
La
contribution économique à travers le Crowdfunding est importante,
mais toute aide non mesurable économiquement est tout aussi
essentielle. Chacun peut nous aider avec:
-
L'envoi d'information utile sur les technologies appliquées ailleurs
-
La diffusion du projet
-
Un mot d'encouragement, des critiques constructives
-
Du travail de bénévolat sur le terrain
Enfin,
il s'agit d'un projet ambitieux qui demande beaucoup de travail, mais
nous sommes convaincus qu'ensemble nous pouvons lui donner vie. Toute
contribution et idée sont les bienvenues!



Pourquoi
nous soutenir?
Nous
avons une grande conviction et détermination pour réaliser ce rêve.
Plusieurs fois dans nos vies - et surtout ces derniers temps – nous
avons été qualifiés de fous par les projets que nous
entreprenions. Mais en voyant les bons résultats obtenus, nous avons
commencé à être soutenus et encouragés dans nos démarches. Nous
savons nous adapter et sommes flexibles face à de nouvelles
opportunités, comme celle que la vie nous présente aujourd'hui.
Soyons réalistes, faisons l'impossible!

EcoCasa SuyanaAn ecological, economical, sustainable and social homeThe
idea
Building
a green and sustainable home that is socially and economically viable
and that can serve as a model to be replicated. The construction will
follow defined criteria in order to achieve low energy consumption,
improve the quality of life and reduce environmental impact.
The
entire project process will be documented and information will be
distributed on a wide scale with free and open content, which will
facilitate the reproduction of this type of construction, subject to
the specific conditions of each site. 

About
Us
We
are a young couple who decided to change our life. We sold our few
possessions in Buenos Aires and began a trip in Latin America (you
can visit our blog www.tiemposdeagua.com). Just before leaving, we
received the wonderful news that we would soon be joined by another
companion on our trip. This did not stop our adventure, and instead
gave it more meaning. After months of travel in Argentina, Chile and
Bolivia, we have decided to move to the mountains of Cordoba for a
few months until our daughter's birth. We want to enjoy the time and
space we gave ourselves for this moment, while investing ourselves in
a stimulating and useful project for the community. After evaluating
everything we have experienced so far on our trip, we decided to give
life to this new idea. 


The
source of the idea

Shortly
after beginning our trip around Latin America, our conversations
concerning problems in the places we were discovering became more
frequent. This was partly because we were together day and night, and especially
because we were very open and sensitive to everything happening
around us.  

In
each place, we discovered problems that appeared to have an easy
solution from our perspective as educated individuals with
environmental awareness and purchasing power. Unfortunately, we have
found that these solutions are not as obvious to the local population
and are not implemented. 

For
example, we felt the strong solar radiation in the south of Argentina
and Chile, and yet solar energy is not exploited: we didn't see any
solar heaters.
We
experienced the constant winds of Patagonia, and we saw small wind
turbines in many houses, but they were all halted. When we asked the
locals about the state of the wind turbines, their answer was: ""They
were installed about two years ago, but they don't work. It seems
that we misused the batteries, but we actually don't really know how
the system works. Now we are waiting for someone to come fix the unit
because the system is locked and only an expert can access it.""
We
smelled the raw sewage running through the streets of some cities in
the north of Argentina, and discovered it was directly discharged
into a river without treatment. The same river was a water resource
for irrigation and farming.
We
saw outdoor dumps around villages in Bolivia, polluting the
environment and water resources, and creating unsanitary areas.
All
these small examples  made us think and ask ourselves: ""What can
we do to change things? How can we improve the quality of life of
communities in Latin America? How can we protect and benefit from the
natural resources of our continent? How can we limit the impact on
the environment?""
Gradually,
our idea began to take shape, and when we moved to the mountains of
Cordoba, knowing that we would not travel for a few months, we began
to think about what we could do in the time leading up to the birth
of our daughter. We also thought of our new responsibilities and
about what kind of world we want for our daughter. We thought about
the questions she might ask: ""And what did you do to change
things? Did you limit yourself to observing and criticizing?"" We
believe that we must act, and today we are lucky enough to have given
ourselves the time to do so. It's time to act, let's begin right now!

What
is the solution?
Our
idea is to build a green, sustainable, affordable home,  that can be
a model for the construction of community housing. We realize that in
order to improve the quality of life and reduce the impact on the
environment, we need to bring together various sustainable
technologies and practices into one place: in a house that can be
visited and serve as an inspiration for better housing.
The
whole process will be documented and all information will be shared
online for free.
Now
that we have the opportunity to implement this project – as we have
time and physical space – we have decided to demonstrate that this
sustainable development approach is viable. This project will serve
as an educational base accessible to all in the long term.
We
believe the success of our project will be the result of our
commitment to:
-
Expertise:
We value knowledge gained both through formal training and life
experience.
- Cultural
awareness: We
know the
place and local culture, so our project will focus on creating local
solutions that can be adapted to other specific locations with
similar conditions.
-
A response to real and tangible needs: Throughout
our trip, we consulted with communities about their needs, and we
will confirm the information collected during the first phase of
research, which will be an essential part in our project.
-
Innovation:
We are curious and innovative, and we are confident that this project
has a technological and economic potential.

What
criteria will we take into account?
-
An economical house. We
want to build an affordable home to help with what we noticed are
common issues: lack of housing and rapid population growth.
-
Keeping it simple.
This property will be tailored to the population that could live
there, avoiding abrupt cultural changes. The technologies in place
should be simple to use and suitable for the community to reach
greater social acceptance. 

-
Minimum maintenance. To
reduce the risk of failure, the house and the technologies applied
must require minimum maintenance and avoid (at best) any need of
specialist intervention.
-
Energy efficiency. The
goal is to build a low-energy house, to minimize the impact of the
environment and to reduce maintenance costs (using for instance solar
water heaters and orientation integrating bioclimatic concepts).
-
Save and reuse water.
With filtration systems, water saving devices (taps, integrated
diffusers, dual-flush toilets ...), greywater treatment, and other
appropriate reuse systems.
-
Reduce and recycle waste.
The house's impact on the environment will be limited if the amount
of waste generated by the occupants is reduced, by providing on-site
solutions such as compost bins. Inorganic and organic waste will be
separated. The compost will be used in the organic vegetable garden,
which will be integrated into the home in a practical and aesthetic
way, and provide fresh vegetables to be consumed throughout the year.
-
A sustainable house.
The main idea is that the construction and green practices are
sustainable over time and adapted to everyday life.
-
A replicable model.
Our objective is to make this project a model for the construction of
new homes and sustainable neighbourhoods, which can be reproduced and
adapted to different scales and in different locations. Each decision
taken will be justified, depending on the climate, population and the
materials available . This is essential to adapt the model to other
locations.
We
are not necessarily talking about very sophisticated and expensive
technologies, but small design improvements and easy green practices
to reduce consumption and environmental impact, and to improve the
quality of life.
Where
do we start?
This
was one of our questions, as gathering and processing data in order
to start the project is not simple. We began by researching the
different energy saving methods in general, and their efficiency and
environmental impact. We looked at water treatment and reuse systems.
We inquired about the approximate time required to build a house in
this area. In order to keep our feet on the ground and create a
concrete project, we have also talked to our neighbours so that they
can tell us about their biggest problems.
With
all the information we collected, in addition to our own experiences,
we decided to take the big step: providing a framework for our
project and finding a way to finance this dream. If we’re seeking a
solution that will be of service to the community, why not ask the
community to help us reach our dream? This is how we arrived at the
idea of Crowdfunding. This platform to raise funds for our project
and spread the world is very close to our idea of community support.
We hope to find partners with the same values and concerns, who share
our vision and can help us to help. 

What's
the plan?
During
the current first
stage,
we are focused on communicating
about the project, fundraising,
and our research.
This
research, which began a while ago, starts by exploring the data on
initial
local conditions:
type of land, local climate, natural resources, access to water and
basic services.
Then
it will be time to find the most
suitable solutions
in the light of these initial conditions, always keeping in mind the
criteria
listed above. This includes a thorough research of the applicable
technologies, of the materials available in the region, and of the
cost of those technologies, in order to ensure the project remains
affordable.  

Each
stage will be documented.
After a summary of the results and decision making, it will be time
to take the next step: purchasing materials and starting the
construction of the house.
Once
the house is built, after testing and facing different problems that
may arise, we will focus on the appropriate way of sharing all the
information gathered in order to replicate
this model elsewhere.
This last step is perhaps the most important, because our ultimate
goal is to demonstrate
that the construction of an ecological, economical and sustainable
home is possible,
and we will share all the information gathered during the project
online
for free.
Furthermore, we want this project to have an educational aspect and
plan to give lectures about the project and its feasibility.

How
can you contribute?
A
donation through Crowdfunding is important, but contributions which
are not economically measurable are also essential. Everyone can help
with:
-
Sending useful information on technologies applied elsewhere
-
Sharing the project! Forward this on to your friends, family and
co-workers

<p>The core reason for all of this is to conserve 3000 acres of precious remnant vegitation. This is not some kind
wishful thinking, we are ready to go and have partnered with all
the right people, so we know the results will be great. 
</p>
<p>Firstly, we are are joining a conservation project
called Gondwana Link.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439351039/b10qlgeyzu1d5ftptaqy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>Gondwana Link aims to achieve reconnected, healthy
and resilient country across South-Western Australia. It builds on
many decades of conservation work. There is a goal to join 1000km of
bushland. 900km has been achieved so far and we will be another 5km. Every bit helps.</p>
<p>Gondwana Link has three basic aims</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>restoring ecological connectivity across South-Western Australia, from the dry woodlands of the interior, to
	the tall wet forests of the far South-West corner; 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>protecting and restoring biodiverse bushland
	on an unprecedented scale; and 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building a living link that reaches Eastward
	across the continent. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These aims are achieved by connecting
national parks, reserves and private land reserves through a
coordinated effort to create wildlife corridors with specific, highly
researched and well executed strategies to protect and restore native
plant and animal species. Please go and look at their website as they
have so much more detailed information about the project.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.gondwanalink.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gondwanalink.org/
</a>
</p>
<p>We will also be partnering with Bush Heritage
Australia to help us with landscape/biodiversity survey's to plan our
revegitation and wildlife protection strategies, as well as funding
for revegitation projects. Bush Heritage (with Greening Australia) is
a major land owner between the Fitzgerald National Park and the
Stirling Ranges National Park, so they've done a lot of conservation
work in the area and know how to get things done. 
</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.bushheritage.org.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bushheritage.org.au/</a>
</p>
<p>We are also joining forces with Nowanup. Nowanup
is a Noongar focused conservation group run by local Noongar people
located about 30km from the property. They run educational sessions
with local schools and community groups, youth crisis intervention,
Noongar Mens Business and Noongar Womens Business. First of all, they are
going to do a culture survey for us to locate any significant sites. They might be artifacts, campsites, sacred sites and graves. We feel
this is most important to do before we start any restoration on the
site, so we know what the real history of this place is and to pay
the proper respect to those people who walked this land before us.
Nowanup has also offered to include us in their Landscape Songlines
project. This is telling the stories of the land, both the dreaming
and the modern story through physically planting songlines on the
landscape. The idea is to generate a significantly sized piece of art
that tells the story of the area that is visible from space. This is
a project that has been started on the Nowanup property and we are
honored that we can join in the telling of the story.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nowanup.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nowanup.com/</a></p>
<p>Like these organisations, we plan in the future to
expand our work to more pieces of ecologically valuable land and to
help others with this important work.</p><p></p><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The project will require a lot of hands on work and
some of the construction and facilities will need shire approval. So
there is a chance that we will not have everything ready for you to use right away. We would really
appreciate your understanding if we are behind schedule.

<p>If you want to contribute non-finanically or if
you wish to contribute at a higher level then what is indicated above please contact us at info@communityroots.org.au</p>

</p><p></p></div>","The PlanImagine waking up on crisp morning, going for walk
through 2400 acres of virgin bush land, full of birds and wildflowers,
collecting bush food from a native food forest, taking a dip in a natural pond, ducking over to a
workshop on earth building then planting a tree, all the while the
Stirling Ranges fill the background. The Borden Nature Park Conservation project allows you, your family and friends to stay, enjoy
and be directly involved with the care and management of part of
one of the world's top 35 biodiversity hotspots. 

Your Perks and our GoalOur aim is to conserve and to rehabilitate 3000 acres of land in
the South of Western Australia, to enrich the bush ecosystem with native pollinators and to build a sustainable
living education centre, open to the public, where you can learn all about permaculture,
earth building, cooking, rekii, pottery, woodworking, painting, yoga, crafting musical instruments and much more.We will integrate sustainable, low impact accommodation facilities,
in the form of a nature park, were you can stay up to twenty eight days and enjoy the beautiful landscape of the highest mountain range in WA. The nature park will be decked out
with solar lighting, composting toilets and a common building with
kitchen and laundry facilities. It's effectively a caravan park but
without the bitumen roads, lawn and Mr Whippy :)
Community Roots Inc. needs to raise $150,000 to finalise the purchase of this land. So far, fifteen of us have put in $200,000 of our
own savings . The full cost of the project is around $350,000 including setup & maintenace, tax, transfer and legal costs.
For your donation you will get some pretty sweet
rewards. The greatest reward is that you are directly
contributing to the conservation and protection of a precious piece of remnant bushland, containing species of flora and fauna found no where else on the planet. Secondly you can get one or all of the rewards
below.


Five year associate
membership to Community Roots Inc.+

(Up to 20) Native Tree with your name on it (not
literally of course)- this tree will be planted on your behalf on the property. You 
will be able to find your tree on  a map that will be displayed at the 
camp site on the property. So when you come to visit you can water and 
care for your very own tree.++



Up to five vouchers for a Nights Camping (Night Camping Voucher) on the land. You can use these in conjunction with your other free camping perks or you can give them to your friends.+++



Camping one weekend a month. You can camp at
	the property one weekend (it can be a long weekend :) every month.+++


Camping every weekend. Every single weekend
	you can come and stay in the beauty and get involved.+++


Camping for 1 week every month. You and your family can come and stay for a whole week every month.+++

Camp for 28 days...Three times a year - Three times a year you can come and stay for 28 days. So if you'd like to hang around for while, this is for you.+++

Insect Hotel - To really help pollination on the land you can sponsor an insect hotel. We will place this on the land on your behalf. These little hotels will create hot spots of insect activity on the land. We will put your name and its location on a map that will be displayed at the camp site.                                 

 Cobb Bench Workshop - Get stuck in straight away. Come and learn how to build your very own beautiful cobb bench. I'm sure you've seen one of these beauties. This will be held in Fremantle on the 24th of October 2015...and will come with lunch.

</li> <li>By raising the water table, Holistic Land and Livestock Management changes the lives of women and children.

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>1% For Women is the organization coordinating and implementing the Slow Food and holistic management training package across Africa.  1% For Women values local ownership of the projects, hence the use of local people as representatives on the ground. We train trainers to keep the progress and momentum going well into the future.<br/></p>
<p><b><i>The focus of our trainings is creating healthy soil. Soil that can once again sustain life, capture rain fall, and support communities encouraging families to stay together and thrive.</i></b></p>
<p>By focusing on communities that have already engaged with Slow Food, we know we have access to a group that is ready to learn and create change for themselves. A community already interested in taking control of their future.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>The Communities and Gardens</h3>
<p>There are 9 gardens in communities around Harare, Zimbabwe where our work begins. These gardens are at schools and also in the community centers of these villages. All 9 gardens are underway, with community members and school children engaged in elevating the quality of life of their friends and family.</p>
<p>Below is a description of the gardens as provided by our partners CHIEHA:<br/></p>
<p><b>1. CHIEHA Garden</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455664285/lbul7t4kpce0lqgyvups.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>CHIEHA garden is the Chiredzi District, Masingo Province. The garden has 35 members composed of 23 women and 12 men.  One of their goals is to:  ""locally supply fresh organic and nutritious vegetables to people living with HIV/AIDS"". Apart from the garden project the group is also rehabilitating degraded land within their environment and at the same time encouraging each other to practice water harvesting as a move to recharge their ground water to guarantee adequate water supply for the garden.</p>
<p><b>2. Chiyambiro School Garden</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455664536/xar8bf3vajuifhk70axt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Chiyambiro secondary school garden was established as a demonstration garden for school children. The school adopted organic agriculture as one of the key hands on lessons for young rural children. They are working with cluster leadership integrating the school into the social and productive skills development of the young schooling generation aimed at encouraging them to love farming that is  ecologically sound, easy, and appropriate to the  communal situation where resources are limited. The garden created learning examples of soil mulching, fertility trenches, and compost heaps and inters cropping. The cluster Coordinator provided training on agro ecology to the school children and their teachers. Agro ecology is gradually developing in the minds of this younger generation.</p>
<p><b>3. Takunda Sangwe School Garden</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455664359/kjl06poegjud6ufbvucu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Takunda Secondary School garden is another garden that has benefited from the Slow Food project due to its important function of educating children in the community through developing learning examples for the children. Members of the Eastern cluster are continuing their efforts to link schools in order to disseminate information into their community on agro ecology, local seeds systems, climate change, youth and women empowerment.</p>
<p><b>4. Mhlotshana Garden</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455664929/gozgegrbmtbtjkizqsts.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The new Mhlotshana Garden was started in the community by 20 smallholder farmers. The members started to fence off the area and introduced zero gradient contours using an ‘A’ frame. Land preparation began in order to work the soil before the farmers started to plant crops. The garden is close to the water point that has perennial water. The project funds managed to repair the group water pump and engine and bought the following to make sure the garden is functional, 100l Diesel, vegetable seeds. As seed beds were prepared a short course on Nursery management was done followed by planting. To date transplanting of tomatoes, cabbages. rape, choumolier and onions has been completed. ""We are therefore expressing our great thanks to the organization for making our dream come true by availing funds to the garden"", the farmers said.</p>
<p><b>5. Sibantubanye Garden</b></p>
<p>Another community garden of 18 members’ was established at Sibantubanye community. The area the garden was established in is very dry receiving an annual rainfall of 400mm per year. The 2013-14 rain season had good rains in Matebeleland provinces leading to high yields in the rain fed arable land. The members of Sibantubanye started working their garden after they had completed harvesting their crops. Seedlings nurseries were planted following a training conducted by cluster Coordinator on nursery management and currently the members are transplanting seedlings on their plots.</p>
<p><b>6. Mupata Garden</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455664891/pd2fwsuxappxoqcposuz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Mupata garden was established by the local Chief some 10 years ago following a successful project towards rehabilitation of a degraded wetland. The Chief realized that there was need to utilize the water and therefore he encouraged his community to develop the garden. Over the past years the garden has been irrigated by buckets which had become strenuous to the elderly. The coming of the Slow Foods Project was a blessing to the Chief and his community. An engine, water pump and 100m polythene pipe were purchased. Watering is now easy for the community and to date a variety of vegetable crops are growing in the garden supplying the community with adequate vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, onions, rape and beans. The project has also become an eco-tourist attraction site and visited by many foreigners.</p>
<p><b>7. Topora Garden</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455665015/irdu8u0ioxtfsxl9yq80.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Topora garden is an initiative of the 25 local community members in the Masvingo district. The garden was initially fenced with tree branches from the nearby forest. The Slow Food Project managed to support this community to purchase 3 by 50kgs of barbed wire and 4 by 1kg fencing nails. .The farmers have already started fencing the garden using barbed wire to close the phase of repairing every year due to stray animals. The garden is now well protected against cattle but sheep and goats still remain a challenge. The farmers are now able to grow their vegetables all year round. A variety of vegetables are being grown such as, chaumolia, sugar beans, rape, covo, onion, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage and early maize. Members were inactive due to stray animals but now they are fully participating. Members who are participating in the garden comprise of widows and youths. The number of members has also increased from 12 to 15 members.  In the garden there are also some herds such as lemon grass, mint, lavender, rosemary and comfrey.</p>
<p><b>8. Zunde Garden</b></p>
<p>Zunde garden was started some 5 years ago by 21 members (8 men and 13 women). The idea was to develop a demonstration model of permaculture where different vegetables are integrated with different herbal plants that act as pest repellants. Production in the garden declined because the farmers were no longer able to irrigate with buckets due to aging of the members and the difficulty carrying the water.<br/>Production has just commenced following support from the Slow Food project. This garden was assisted with barbed wire fence, 100m hose pipe, 2 garden forks, different varieties of seeds such squash, potatoes, rape, onions, peas and carrots and production of vegetables is expected to commence.<br/>Following the good rains of the 2013-14 season herbs are beginning to regrow and quite a number of people are benefiting through using these herbs as natural medicines.</p>
<p><b>9. Kuwirirana Garden</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455665156/dn9fkjml3oef41jbtvw7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Kuwirana group has 6 members (5 female and 1 male) and these farmers are working very hard in a garden of 96m x 66m. They are growing different vegetables that are being sold to the local township. They also produce mushroom in their homesteads. Production in the garden had declined to lack of proper watering equipment and other garden tools. The five female members are elderly women who are now finding it hard to carry buckets and walk for long distances.<br/>This garden was assisted with barbed wire fence; 100m hose pipe, 2 garden forks, and different varieties of seeds such squash, potatoes, rape, onions, peas and carrots.<br/>Production have improved, watering has been made easier and thee garden is now well fenced reducing the problem of stray animals.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are raising the funding for this collaborative project beginning in Zimbabwe and spreading across the African Continent. The results of this training have been proven, and the communities are already engaged  through their existing Slow Food Gardens. We will begin working with university students both in Harare, Zimbabwe and the United States to gather baseline data and put all of the pieces in place to scale our project across the African Continent. Changing the landscape of Africa is critical to global climate change efforts.</p>
<p>The next stage of training and implementation will take $25,000 to complete. Our team has been self-funding to date and has committed over $30,000 to get the project underway. We are committed to investing the additional $10,000 from the money we raise through this campaign to get the implementation started.

</div> <div> <h3>Our Team<br/>
</h3>Our team at 1% for Women has experience and proven results implementing Holistic Land and Livestock Management (HLLM) in communities around the world. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/>In a community outside of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, the women used to 
wake at 2am and walk a significant distance to gather their water for 
the day from a communal well. If they over slept, or were late getting 
to the well, they and their families often went without water for the 
day.<br/><br/>Through HLLM and Communal Grazing Training, this community now has water that flows through their village, even during the dry season. The flowing water has changed the lives of the entire community. The women now contribute to the livelihood of their families, the community receives money for the water they are ""creating"" in the river, crops are thriving and their quality of life for all has increased significantly.<br/><br/>From their example, and the training from our team members, this community is now training and supporting adjoining communities. <br/><br/>The Slow Food Gardens Project utilizes individuals within the countries and communities of impact. Individuals familiar with the culture and ancestral knowledge of the communities. <br/><br/>Together, we collectively work to understand the community goals and needs, use their available tools to create a plan, monitor and adjust as necessary, all the while training them and empowering the community members to continue to thrive well into the future.<br/><br/>These efforts are being lead by our founder, Laurie Benson. After spending years promoting the work of Zimbabwean biologist Allan Savory and Holistic Management, she stepped out on her own to focus on empowering and uplifting women in agriculture on a global level. She believes that the empowerment of women is a crucial component to changing worldwide economic, environmental and social degradation.<br/><br/>Based in Buena Vista, CO, 1% For Women promotes businesses that commit 1% of their net profit to microcredit loans for women in agriculture around the world, actively changing the cycles of poverty and oppression that still affect so many. Along with the microcredit loans, 1% For Women brings the training program highlighted above to communities around the world.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456163181/v3s5q9se6ge09lcx3o2t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Women who once awoke at 2am to gather their limited water for the day, can now focus on contributing to their family income, educate their children and earn respect for their ability to contribute to change and growth.
 Healthy communities create healthy, empowered children that stay in school and positively contribute to the future of their families and communities, both local and global.


Here is a great graphic from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs that highlights why it is so important to support women in agriculture.




The Process
1% For Women is the organization coordinating and implementing the Slow Food and holistic management training package across Africa.  1% For Women values local ownership of the projects, hence the use of local people as representatives on the ground. We train trainers to keep the progress and momentum going well into the future.
The focus of our trainings is creating healthy soil. Soil that can once again sustain life, capture rain fall, and support communities encouraging families to stay together and thrive.
By focusing on communities that have already engaged with Slow Food, we know we have access to a group that is ready to learn and create change for themselves. A community already interested in taking control of their future.


The impact on surrounding communities will be felt by improved livelihoods, increased access to water, and increased crop production. The ripple effect created from this work will continue to spread and grow as the knowledge moves beyond the beginning communities.
You can learn more about our training program and request additional information on our website.



What Your Contribution Does


Your contribution allows us to go into these communities that are already invested in changing their own future, and provide training. Our train-the-trainers program focuses on community development, holistic land and livestock training, agroecology, natural resource planning, financial planning and more.
By training individuals within these communities, we provide the skills and tools needed to restore healthy soil, raise the water table and increase crop production, bringing security and dignity to families.
These communities become examples for their neighbors and they are soon sharing their knowledge and continuing this cycle of healing and growth.
Each community will cost approximately $12,500 for the following expenses. Your support will allow us to begin in 2 new communities in 2016. 
Expenses:


Community Resources & Training Include:
Training Workshops
Resources and funding for community herders

Garden and Kraal (temporary, movable cattle enclosures) materials
Educational materials
Trainer lodging, food and travel
Marketing and outreach


 
The Communities and Gardens
There are 9 gardens in communities around Harare, Zimbabwe where our work begins. These gardens are at schools and also in the community centers of these villages. All 9 gardens are underway, with community members and school children engaged in elevating the quality of life of their friends and family.
Below is a description of the gardens as provided by our partners CHIEHA:
1. CHIEHA Garden


CHIEHA garden is the Chiredzi District, Masingo Province. The garden has 35 members composed of 23 women and 12 men.  One of their goals is to:  ""locally supply fresh organic and nutritious vegetables to people living with HIV/AIDS"". Apart from the garden project the group is also rehabilitating degraded land within their environment and at the same time encouraging each other to practice water harvesting as a move to recharge their ground water to guarantee adequate water supply for the garden.
2. Chiyambiro School Garden


Chiyambiro secondary school garden was established as a demonstration garden for school children. The school adopted organic agriculture as one of the key hands on lessons for young rural children. They are working with cluster leadership integrating the school into the social and productive skills development of the young schooling generation aimed at encouraging them to love farming that is  ecologically sound, easy, and appropriate to the  communal situation where resources are limited. The garden created learning examples of soil mulching, fertility trenches, and compost heaps and inters cropping. The cluster Coordinator provided training on agro ecology to the school children and their teachers. Agro ecology is gradually developing in the minds of this younger generation.
3. Takunda Sangwe School Garden


Takunda Secondary School garden is another garden that has benefited from the Slow Food project due to its important function of educating children in the community through developing learning examples for the children. Members of the Eastern cluster are continuing their efforts to link schools in order to disseminate information into their community on agro ecology, local seeds systems, climate change, youth and women empowerment.
4. Mhlotshana Garden


The new Mhlotshana Garden was started in the community by 20 smallholder farmers. The members started to fence off the area and introduced zero gradient contours using an ‘A’ frame. Land preparation began in order to work the soil before the farmers started to plant crops. The garden is close to the water point that has perennial water. The project funds managed to repair the group water pump and engine and bought the following to make sure the garden is functional, 100l Diesel, vegetable seeds. As seed beds were prepared a short course on Nursery management was done followed by planting. To date transplanting of tomatoes, cabbages. rape, choumolier and onions has been completed. ""We are therefore expressing our great thanks to the organization for making our dream come true by availing funds to the garden"", the farmers said.
5. Sibantubanye Garden
Another community garden of 18 members’ was established at Sibantubanye community. The area the garden was established in is very dry receiving an annual rainfall of 400mm per year. The 2013-14 rain season had good rains in Matebeleland provinces leading to high yields in the rain fed arable land. The members of Sibantubanye started working their garden after they had completed harvesting their crops. Seedlings nurseries were planted following a training conducted by cluster Coordinator on nursery management and currently the members are transplanting seedlings on their plots.
6. Mupata Garden


Mupata garden was established by the local Chief some 10 years ago following a successful project towards rehabilitation of a degraded wetland. The Chief realized that there was need to utilize the water and therefore he encouraged his community to develop the garden. Over the past years the garden has been irrigated by buckets which had become strenuous to the elderly. The coming of the Slow Foods Project was a blessing to the Chief and his community. An engine, water pump and 100m polythene pipe were purchased. Watering is now easy for the community and to date a variety of vegetable crops are growing in the garden supplying the community with adequate vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, onions, rape and beans. The project has also become an eco-tourist attraction site and visited by many foreigners.
7. Topora Garden


Topora garden is an initiative of the 25 local community members in the Masvingo district. The garden was initially fenced with tree branches from the nearby forest. The Slow Food Project managed to support this community to purchase 3 by 50kgs of barbed wire and 4 by 1kg fencing nails. .The farmers have already started fencing the garden using barbed wire to close the phase of repairing every year due to stray animals. The garden is now well protected against cattle but sheep and goats still remain a challenge. The farmers are now able to grow their vegetables all year round. A variety of vegetables are being grown such as, chaumolia, sugar beans, rape, covo, onion, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage and early maize. Members were inactive due to stray animals but now they are fully participating. Members who are participating in the garden comprise of widows and youths. The number of members has also increased from 12 to 15 members.  In the garden there are also some herds such as lemon grass, mint, lavender, rosemary and comfrey.
8. Zunde Garden
Zunde garden was started some 5 years ago by 21 members (8 men and 13 women). The idea was to develop a demonstration model of permaculture where different vegetables are integrated with different herbal plants that act as pest repellants. Production in the garden declined because the farmers were no longer able to irrigate with buckets due to aging of the members and the difficulty carrying the water.Production has just commenced following support from the Slow Food project. This garden was assisted with barbed wire fence, 100m hose pipe, 2 garden forks, different varieties of seeds such squash, potatoes, rape, onions, peas and carrots and production of vegetables is expected to commence.Following the good rains of the 2013-14 season herbs are beginning to regrow and quite a number of people are benefiting through using these herbs as natural medicines.
9. Kuwirirana Garden


Kuwirana group has 6 members (5 female and 1 male) and these farmers are working very hard in a garden of 96m x 66m. They are growing different vegetables that are being sold to the local township. They also produce mushroom in their homesteads. Production in the garden had declined to lack of proper watering equipment and other garden tools. The five female members are elderly women who are now finding it hard to carry buckets and walk for long distances.This garden was assisted with barbed wire fence; 100m hose pipe, 2 garden forks, and different varieties of seeds such squash, potatoes, rape, onions, peas and carrots.Production have improved, watering has been made easier and thee garden is now well fenced reducing the problem of stray animals.
  What We Need & What You Get We are raising the funding for this collaborative project beginning in Zimbabwe and spreading across the African Continent. The results of this training have been proven, and the communities are already engaged  through their existing Slow Food Gardens. We will begin working with university students both in Harare, Zimbabwe and the United States to gather baseline data and put all of the pieces in place to scale our project across the African Continent. Changing the landscape of Africa is critical to global climate change efforts.
The next stage of training and implementation will take $25,000 to complete. Our team has been self-funding to date and has committed over $30,000 to get the project underway. We are committed to investing the additional $10,000 from the money we raise through this campaign to get the implementation started. With your support we can begin the work in Zimbabwe that will act as a springboard to impact garden communities and schools throughout Africa.As a thank you for your support, we are offering incredible perks from one of our 1% For Women Businesses, the Buena Vista Roastery.   The Roastery offers fair-trade, organic coffees and works directly with women farmers in Costa Rica and Guatemala. They are also the first non-land-based business to use Holistic Management to increase their profits and local and global community impact. We are excited to offer you some of their incredible coffee in return for your support.Bumper Stickers! Some of our perks also include our 1% for Women bumper stickers, so you can show the world that you are engaged in creating a better future for us all.
  Our Team
Our team at 1% for Women has experience and proven results implementing Holistic Land and Livestock Management (HLLM) in communities around the world. In a community outside of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, the women used to 
wake at 2am and walk a significant distance to gather their water for 
the day from a communal well. If they over slept, or were late getting 
to the well, they and their families often went without water for the 
day.Through HLLM and Communal Grazing Training, this community now has water that flows through their village, even during the dry season. The flowing water has changed the lives of the entire community. The women now contribute to the livelihood of their families, the community receives money for the water they are ""creating"" in the river, crops are thriving and their quality of life for all has increased significantly.From their example, and the training from our team members, this community is now training and supporting adjoining communities. The Slow Food Gardens Project utilizes individuals within the countries and communities of impact. Individuals familiar with the culture and ancestral knowledge of the communities. Together, we collectively work to understand the community goals and needs, use their available tools to create a plan, monitor and adjust as necessary, all the while training them and empowering the community members to continue to thrive well into the future.These efforts are being lead by our founder, Laurie Benson. After spending years promoting the work of Zimbabwean biologist Allan Savory and Holistic Management, she stepped out on her own to focus on empowering and uplifting women in agriculture on a global level. She believes that the empowerment of women is a crucial component to changing worldwide economic, environmental and social degradation.Based in Buena Vista, CO, 1% For Women promotes businesses that commit 1% of their net profit to microcredit loans for women in agriculture around the world, actively changing the cycles of poverty and oppression that still affect so many. Along with the microcredit loans, 1% For Women brings the training program highlighted above to communities around the world.

<h3>More details about Margarito's Forest </h3>
<p><i>Margarito’s Forest </i>is set in Saq Ja’, a small, remote village in
the mountains of central Guatemala. Saq Ja’ was settled early in the twentieth
century by indigenous Maya communities who left the highland plains because of deforestation
and overcrowding. For many decades the families that settled in Saq
Ja’ grew and prospered in their fertile mountain village. And it was there that Margarito
Esteban Álvarez Velázquez—Don Margarito—was
born on October 18, 1931.</p>
<p>The peaceful
existence of the families in Saq Ja’ began to crumble in 1954, when a military
coup overthrew Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán, the democratically elected president of Guatemala.
The overthrow led to a series of military dictators and a long dirty war, which
included genocide of the Maya. In a series of assaults between 1981 and 1982, the
village of Saq Ja’ was destroyed by the Guatemalan military. Many villagers
died in the attacks, while others joined the political resistance, fled into
the mountains, or went to refugee camps in Central America. Among those who went
into hiding in the mountains was María Guadalupe, the daughter of Don Margarito,
and among those who fled Guatemala was Virgilio Vicente. In response to this humanitarian
crisis, the Sanctuary Movement was formed in the 1980s to welcome Central
American refugees into the United States. In 1986 Don Virgilio was taken into sanctuary
at University Church in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<p>After the signing
of the Guatemalan Peace Accords in 1996, some of those displaced by the war
began to return to their ancestral lands. Indigenous-led organizations like Guatemalan
Christian Action (ACG) were particularly helpful to displaced Guatemalans as
they sought to retain their cultural identity and rebuild their devastated homes.
In 1998, accompanied by Garry Sparks from ACG and Dan Dale from University
Church, Don Virgilio returned to participate in the rebuilding of Saq Ja’ . With
that pilgrimage and Don Virgilio’s wise leadership, a partnership was
established between the people of Saq Ja’ and members of University Church. Almost
every year since that initial trip in 1998, a delegation from University Church
has returned to Saq Ja’.</p>
<p>In April of 2007
I made my first trip to Guatemala as a member of the University Church delegation.
On our last day In Saq Ja’, Don Virgilio took the delegation on a tour of
various projects in the community. It was a hot day and so he took us to a cool,
densely forested part of the mountain to sit and talk. At that time I was struck by the
stark contrast between the lush old-growth forest where we sat, and the fields
and scrub brush that surrounded it. I asked Don Virgilio if he knew anything
about the forest. He told me that Margarito, a man with a peculiar love of
trees, had planted the forest. He added that although Margarito was killed
during the war, his daughter, María Guadalupe, was now living here and tending
his forest. With this intriguing introduction, and a series of interviews with María
Guadalupe, the development of <i>Margarito’s
Forest</i> was set into motion. </p>
<p>During the war years María Guadalupe lost
most of her family. She and her two young children survived by hiding in the
mountains of Guatemala. Following the Peace Accords, María Guadalupe returned
to Saq Ja’, where she has continued Don Margarito’s legacy of community leadership.
She is a village midwife and serves on three of Saq Ja's committees: the
Women's Committee, the Education Commission, and the Central Committee. In addition,
she is a member of the National Committee on Reparations set up in 2005 after
the end of the civil war. </p>
<p>This book, the
story of Don Margarito and his forest as told by his daughter María Guadalupe,
resulted from the partnership Don Virgilio forged between Saq Ja’ and
University Church. It is a story of Maya culture and wisdom passed from one
generation to the next. It is a celebration of Margarito’s forest and its preservation. </p>

</div></div>","Keep the SNOWstorm going! 



 Two years ago, when an historic invasion of snowy owls flooded eastern North America, a group of scientists, raptor banders, wildlife veterinarians and pathologists created Project SNOWstorm.Our goal was -- and remains -- to study the winter ecology of these huge, ghostly raptors when they ""irrupt"" south of the Arctic. By understanding how they live and what they need, we can better know how to preserve snowy owls in the future. Although the irruptions are part of a natural cycle, scientists believe that these owls -- which nest at the very highest latitudes in the northern hemisphere -- are among the handful of species at greatest and most immediate risk from climate change.The heart of our research is incredible new technology that allows us to track snowy owl behavior with an unprecedented level of detail -- GPS/GSM transmitters that let us follow the birds with astounding, 3D precision, around the clock and for years at a time.The Indiegogo community has made this research possible by underwriting the expensive transmitters, which account for the largest portion of our expenses. Project SNOWstorm supporters have also underwritten the cost of laboratory tests for heavy metals, rodent poisons and other environmental toxins; the analysis of chemical isotopes in feathers, blood and tissue that tell us where in the Arctic the owl came from, and what it's been eating; and necropsies on owls that are found dead to understand the threats they face while down here with us.Since that first winter, Project SNOWstorm has grown into a collaboration of more than 40 scientists and specialists, and dozens of organizations and agencies. But every penny we raise still goes straight into the research -- none of the team members draws a salary or a stipend. We are all volunteers.In the past two years, we've unlocked many secrets about how these mysterious birds live, and confirmed quantitatively many things researchers had long suspected about their behavior, movement and ecology.
But we're not content to sit on our laurels. We're ready to take Project SNOWstorm to a new level -- with your help. The Indiegogo community remains our most important group of supporters.
This winter, we're deploying a new generation of GPS trackers that provide additional layers of data with no extra weight or expense -- like temperature sensors that give us information about the weather, or miniature tri-axial accelerometers that constantly record changes in a tagged owl's movement and even its posture, and allow us to study its hunting behavior, daily activity and energy expenditures.

Because preliminary tests suggest that mercury contamination is a significant problem for snowy owls, we're preparing to conduct extensive (and expensive) laboratory analysis of samples from hundreds of owls to determine the extent of this toxin in their systems, and how exposure varies geographically, between adults and juveniles, and from both the Arctic breeding grounds and the more southerly wintering areas.

Your support will also allow us to bring a Ph.D. student into the project, through our partners at the University of Saskatchewan -- someone whose dissertation research will focus on the complex movement ecology of our dozens of tagged owls.
Project SNOWstorm is possible because of you. If you're a past supporter, thank you, and please consider renewing your support. If you're new to our work, please consider a tax-deductible gift that will help better understand -- and preserve -- this remarkable species.

What We Need


We've set a goal for this winter of $25,000 -- a jump from last year. We're not doing this lightly.
The funding goes primarily to purchase the GPS/GSM transmitters we use. Even with a significant discount from the manufacturer, Cellular Tracking Technologies (something CTT has provided since the beginning) the transmitters cost roughly $3,000 each. We expect to tag an additional 8-10 owls this winter, and your support will help make that possible.
We're also committed to providing critical initial bridge funding to bring a Ph.D. student to our partner, the University of Saskatchewan, where the student will focus their doctoral research on analyzing our extraordinarily rich trove of snowy owl telemetry data -- the most detailed dataset of this species' movements ever assembled.  And your support will allow us to continue the important laboratory work that is teasing out the environmental toxins like mercury, rodenticides, DDE and other chemicals that pose an increasingly significant risk to snowy owls and other raptors.

</div></div>","About the Project



The Kitsap Forest & Bay Project is a visionary effort to conserve nearly 7,000 acres of forest and
shoreline on Puget Sound. This land was once a hub of Washington State’s
timber industry.  With the former lumber mill gone, the landowner has
provided the community with a tremendous opportunity to conserve the land and
trails for all time.  With
your help, we can conserve this beautiful place and all of the wonderful
outdoor recreation it supports.



In 2014 donors like you helped raise funds to purchase the first 500 acres of forest and beach on Port Gamble Bay, preserving the property's rich ecosystems and well-loved nature trails.  We then purchased a nearly 400-acre expansion to North Kitsap Heritage Park.

Now, with your help, we can protect 270 more acres in the heart of our project.  Grovers Creek Preserve is the jewel at the center of the Kitsap Forest and Bay Project – a place of old growth trees and a vital link in the Sound to Olympics Trail.
We’ve raised more than $1.8 million toward this purchase.  Now we need YOUR help to raise the last $25,000 in the next 18 days! Any funds raised beyond our goal will help purchase additional land in the Kitsap Forest & Bay Project.




Our Opportunity to Save a SPECIAL Place

Kitsap Forest & Bay lands and waters have been at the cultural heart of local tribes for eons–providing sustenance for families and enriching tribal traditions that continue to this day.  They draw thousands of outdoor recreationists annually–strengthening the local economy and promoting healthy lifestyles.  These waters support fish and wildlife that are critical to a healthy Puget Sound.

This land was a hub of the Puget Sound timber industry for a century and a half. With the former lumber mill gone and an uncertain future for its timberlands, the landowner has provided the community with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to conserve the land for all time.

One Step at a Time
Due to Kitsap Forest & Bay Project's immense size, the Coalition is tackling land acquisition in phases.  With your help, we completed the first phase–saving the Port Gamble Bay Shoreline.  With that accomplished, we went on to Phase II–adding nearly 400 acres to expand North Kitsap Heritage Park.  Now, with your help we will accomplish Phase III–saving Grovers Creek Preserve!






Saving the Land and Trails


Phase III: Grovers Creek Preserve


Explore the Grovers Creek landscape and you'll find a rare grove of 200-year-old Sitka spruce, hemlock, cedar, Douglas fir and grand fir.  You'll also find a peat bog that gives spring to your step as you cross its hummocks and skirt its pools.  You'll cross Grovers Creek on a fallen log and marvel at the handiwork of beavers.  These diverse habitats support over 60 bird species and host threatened steelhead as well as coho and cutthroat trout.Grovers Creek Preserve is at the center of a forest corridor of nearly 1,700 acres spanning the Kitsap Peninsula.  To the east lies North Kitsap Heritage Park.  The land to the west is proposed to be protected as the North Kitsap Community Forest.  Farther west, the Kitsap Forest & Bay Coalition is working to conserve the Port Gamble Forest's trails and wildlife habitat.  Together, these properties will conserve a significant open space corridor and protect land critical to a future Sound to Olympics Trail.A regional trail like the Burke-Gilman Trail and Olympic Discovery
Trail, the Sound to Olympics Trail will connect to regional trails on the east side
of Puget Sound via the Seattle-Bainbridge and the Edmonds-Kingston ferries, and
west to the Olympic Peninsula via the Hood Canal Bridge. Construction of the
first link in the Sound to Olympics Trail is scheduled to begin this year.  A key element of the Sound to Olympics Trail
vision is protection of lands like Grovers Creek Preserve.
Protected for all time, the Preserve will provide a place for families to explore these natural wonders on foot and bicycle.  YOUR help is needed TODAY to raise the last $25,000!

Sunlight is free electricity that reduces or eliminates our power bills and therefore our taxes.  Solar panels are warranted for twenty five years and as dependable as sunrise. There is no downside to solar. Strengthens our civil defense and security in times of national Disasters. Climate change is a real problem that only grows worse by the years, see the documentary Inconvenient Truth ziipp.eu/?u=http://<a href=""http://www.youtube"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.youtube</a> . Increasing solar usage helps to promote the solution to the general public and is good advertising for installers.</p><p>            The latest science on solar flares says that just one of these directly hitting the earth can overload the power grids of the planet. Destroying transformers, generators, and high voltage power lines. See youtube video from discovery The Sun in HD <a href=""http://www.youtube"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.youtube</a> .  Solar panels are low voltage, decentralized, and easier to protect so they should survive most of that sort of damage. Your donations will pay for our corporate charter and tax filing with the IRS. GoSolarASAP.org is going to be a social welfare organization non-profit 501 (c 4) foundation helping this country to persevere. We raise funds to help provide solar energy panels for emergency services. Fire departments, hospitals,and police stations should have a long term power source uninterruptable from war, EMPS, CMES, grid failure, and severe weather. Today's world demands energy for essential services and solar energy is the perfect locally produced power for years and decades. Diesel backup generators don't have that capability. <br/></p>               The more electricity from rooftops the stronger this country is in national emergencies. Nothing is more reliable than the sun for clean free power. This also strengthens the grid by increasing power production during peak daylight hours.

Sunlight is free electricity that reduces or eliminates our power bills and therefore our taxes.  Solar panels are warranted for twenty five years and as dependable as sunrise. There is no downside to solar. Strengthens our civil defense and security in times of national Disasters. Climate change is a real problem that only grows worse by the years, see the documentary Inconvenient Truth ziipp.eu/?u=http://www.youtube . Increasing solar usage helps to promote the solution to the general public and is good advertising for installers.            The latest science on solar flares says that just one of these directly hitting the earth can overload the power grids of the planet. Destroying transformers, generators, and high voltage power lines. See youtube video from discovery The Sun in HD www.youtube .  Solar panels are low voltage, decentralized, and easier to protect so they should survive most of that sort of damage. Your donations will pay for our corporate charter and tax filing with the IRS. GoSolarASAP.org is going to be a social welfare organization non-profit 501 (c 4) foundation helping this country to persevere. We raise funds to help provide solar energy panels for emergency services. Fire departments, hospitals,and police stations should have a long term power source uninterruptable from war, EMPS, CMES, grid failure, and severe weather. Today's world demands energy for essential services and solar energy is the perfect locally produced power for years and decades. Diesel backup generators don't have that capability.                The more electricity from rooftops the stronger this country is in national emergencies. Nothing is more reliable than the sun for clean free power. This also strengthens the grid by increasing power production during peak daylight hours.

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Tampa Deep-Sea X-plorers LLC was formed as a legal entity in the state of Florida with the intention of competing for the XPRIZE. We are currently recruiting talented technicians and engineers who are interested in participating in the contest. We have a particular need for expertise in the areas of mechanical engineering, computer programming, robotics, marketing, web design, and business. The overall team will consist of 10 – 30 individuals across multiple disciplines. The team will be subdivided into smaller teams to concentrate on specific components that will be incorporated into the larger project. We will be building our robots out of recycled scuba tanks and other recycled materials.</p>

<p>Florida undeveloped coastal land is becoming extinct.  If you have been to Florida, you have seen what development and tourism has done to Miami, Clearwater, Naples and more.  We want to help PRESERVE, but still provide ""walk lightly"" access to some of the last, natural islands in the Tampa Bay area!</p>
<p>We have identified a multiple island location within 30 minutes of a major airport in Florida that we could acquire and turn into a eco-friendly vacation location that not only is environmentally friendly in its use, but also in how the accommodations are built up.</p>
<p>Minimally invasive flora removal to locate the necessary buildings to support our boats access to the land and amenities with hand carrying and clearing to ensure we only ""tread"" on what we absolutely have to.....and we will keep 90% of the land in its natural condition!</p>

<p>We will use composting toilets so that we turn the waste that WE produce into fertilizer for the flora that we LEFT when we built the accommodations.  </p>

<p>We can do this, we can build the case that shows that it is feasible and viable, we can make a difference and we can lead our industry and country forward.......................................................with your help!</p>
</div></div>","B&B Aboard was started over a year ago in Clearwater, Florida with the simple idea that travelers might enjoy staying on the water just as much as we do! We were right, since opening we now have 2 boats and are booked to capacity almost every day.


The floating tourism industry is rapidly growing and we are firm believers that with the industries growing popularity, we need to take the same steps to reduce our environmental impact. But we are a small operation and can't do it alone. That is why we are starting this campaign. With your help we hope to first take ourselves off the grid with self sustaining energy while offering you some great perks in return. 




As travel enthusiasts, lifelong boaters, sailors and entrepreneurs we have lived or visited most of the far reaching corners of the world.  In those journeys we learned just how easy it can be to get our power from the sun, wind and water as well as harvest fresh water from the sea. Unfortunately we also learned how under utilized those resources are. We've witnessed, first hand, the effects of pollution and environmental disregard. Since then we have made a conscious effort to make decisions that help the environment instead of hurting it. 





Eco tourism is becoming more and more popular especially in under developed countries. We want to show that not only can we continue to make our floating B&B more Eco-friendly but also prove that Eco tourism is a viable option on the water in the United States.

Once the initiative is funded and completed you will be able to soak in our hot tubs, take that long hot shower, sit outside at night under the blue glow of LED lights, enjoy the breeze while watching an outdoor movie, or crank up your room's AC all without negatively impacting the environment because now the sun and wind are providing the whole business with that energy!


These boats have both been a work of love from the start.  Laid Back was purchased from a family that had used it with three generations, but had just left it sit for almost a decade.  We brought it back from the brink with custom hand built cherry cabinetry, bamboo floors and more.



The remodel above shows left to right:  King Room 1, the kitchen, and the main living area.  Laid Back has been reborn with character!
The story of the remodel of Innfinity has a sad start as well.  After 8 years of fishing charter in the BVIs, she was brough back to Fort Myers florida and left to rot.  With 50 holes in the roof, trees growing inside, engines underwater and no mechanical system in tact.  She was basically a start from scratch, completely re-wire, re-plumb, re-floor, re-ceiling, rebuilt engines......I think you get the picture.



The remodel above shows left to right: King Room 4, the living area, and the kitchen.  Innfinity was rebuilt not only with style and character but also with A LOT of sweat!

Since the initial rebuilts, we have started taking steps to make these boats more environmentally friendly. 



We have installed sun shades that block out 90% off the sun's warming effect while still remaining see through for the guests enjoyment!





We have upgraded both vessels to very high efficiency mini split cooling systems that consume about 50% of traditional compressor based air conditioners!





We have upgraded all of the hot water systems to high efficiency instant heat technology. 





We have migrated all of the lighting to low consumption LEDs.  






We have started our own recycling program for the boats even though no marina we have ever been in with any boat has ever recycled anything!  


But we want to do more....





 What we need is the materials and technology to outfit both of our boats with both solar panels and wind generators so they are COMPLETELY self-sufficient! 


Our campaign is to achieve the following:



Acquire materials and build the aluminum support structure for the solar panels.


Acquire materials and build the aluminum support structure for the wind generators.


Solar panels  along with wiring and junction boxes.




Inverters connected to battery banks capable of turning the green output into usable power.





How much is it going to cost us to do this?  Here is a breakdown of our budget:


Solar Panels (75 @ $350) => $26,250
Wind Generators (6 @ $1750) => $10,500
Batteries (50 @ $1500) => $75,000
Wire (2500ft @ $1) => $2,500
Connectors/JunctionBoxes  => $1500
Hardware => $250
Aluminum Solar Support Structure =>$10,000
Aluminum Wind Support Structure (6@500) => $3,000
Roofing gutters/seals => $500
Mechanical Labor (2 weeks, 2 people) => $3200
Electrical Labor (2 weeks, 2 people) => $3200
Engineering (structures and wiring) => $4000

TOTAL:  ~$150,000

We want to get this phase done quickly so we can move on to bigger impacts in our future phases, so we have a very aggressive timeline to complete this project!





Although helping our environment is rewarding in itself, we are offering some great perks for your donations.  From the simple to the sublime, we have a perk that we think everyone can enjoy.  The bonus part about our perks is that the boats are already running, so you can enjoy your perk literally tomorrow........no big wait times, no delays.  If your timing is right, you might even get to see your donation becoming reality as we build out the equipment on the boats (quietly of course).
If you just want to help us make a difference in our power hungry world but cannot actually come and enjoy the donations:


T-shirts - Sweaters - Hoodies - Sun shirts

We are offering 4 different apparel choices that will help show your support for our cause. There is a style for every taste and climate. We chose the highest quality shirts we could find for maximum comfort and durability. 

Tax Credit For Equipment Sponsorship



Interested in making a bigger impact?  The federal government offers direct tax credits for the installation of alternative energy systems.  If you sponsor a solar panel, inverter, wind generator or battery and you get your name on it as well as all of the paperwork and instructions necessary for you to obtain that tax credit on your 2016 Federal Income taxes.  The CREDIT is approximately 30% of your total donation!



Accommodation Packages  

If you'd like to come and check out the impact of what you have helped to create with your donations, we are offering accommodation packages on either of our boats!  We are also offering all-inclusive nights, boat exclusive nights, luxury nights and luxury exclusive nights!  And the great part is you can come and use your perk as soon as this campaign is over because the boats are already open!

Florida undeveloped coastal land is becoming extinct.  If you have been to Florida, you have seen what development and tourism has done to Miami, Clearwater, Naples and more.  We want to help PRESERVE, but still provide ""walk lightly"" access to some of the last, natural islands in the Tampa Bay area!
We have identified a multiple island location within 30 minutes of a major airport in Florida that we could acquire and turn into a eco-friendly vacation location that not only is environmentally friendly in its use, but also in how the accommodations are built up.
Minimally invasive flora removal to locate the necessary buildings to support our boats access to the land and amenities with hand carrying and clearing to ensure we only ""tread"" on what we absolutely have to.....and we will keep 90% of the land in its natural condition!








How often have you looked at vacation options in our country and wished that the owners had any idea how simple it can be to make the facility kind to nature.  Our new facility would use sustainable materials for the build.  
We will again power it completely with solar and wind power to be a 100% sustainable location and we can get our eco-cyling going much stronger with our own landside presence!  
We will use composting toilets so that we turn the waste that WE produce into fertilizer for the flora that we LEFT when we built the accommodations.  
We will be fresh water neutral: we will install our own desalinization portable system running on OUR solar and wind energy to harvest fresh water for life from the sea as well as converting all of our boats with this fresh water supply!


We will also need LPG for cooking and laundry, but we also have great options to make that need sustainable as well.  It also just so happens that we can help support our other fellow Crowdfunders.  By implementing our own gas creation system, we will also be able to create an eco-cycle for that need as well.  This gas supply will run our cooking, laundry and more on both land and our boats!(https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/homebiogas-create-your-own-energy-environment-green/x/14560409#/)
We will have salt water swimming pools with solar powered heating and cooling that made the pool chemical free, but also energy neutral.  








This particular area has approximately a dozen small islands that are all private and for sale.  In the future, we would like to continue our preservation with small, private,  Eco-friendly bungalows on each island connected to the very first island via an electric ferry boat that is charged by our solar arrays!!!




We can do this, we can build the case that shows that it is feasible and viable, we can make a difference and we can lead our industry and country forward.......................................................with your help!",48.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><b>About this Campaign</b></p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds
which will be used for purchasing acreage in the greater Winston Salem area and
developing the infrastructure needed for an operational retreat center.  The retreat center will be a resilient,
self-sustaining property designed in accordance with permaculture principles,
and with an emphasis on physical, emotional and spiritual healing.  A few farm activities and retreat topics
we’re expecting include permaculture design, natural buildings, biofuels, solar
harvesting, hydroelectric and wind power generation, earthworks, grafting and
tree propagation, vegetable production, bee keeping, meat production, food
forestry, silvo-pasturing, coppicing, seed saving, seed germination, husbandry,
cheese making, composting, vermiculture, aquaponics, soil remediation, mushroom
cultivation, medicinal herb cultivation, essential oil distillation,
aromatherapy,  yoga, meditation, Reiki,
energy healing, qi gong, acupuncture, massage therapy, juice therapy, music
therapy, nature therapy, probiotics, traditional Chinese medicine, and
biodynamics.  Retreat topics will be
non-sectarian.  We hope to host our first
retreat in September, 2016.</p>
<p>At this time we recognize that
now more than ever, it’s absolutely necessary for our human society to
reestablish the connection to our food. 
Our goal is to become stewards of the Earth and to reach out and connect
with our fellow suffering humans.  This
idea, The Food is Medicine Project, creates a bridge that can lead to balance,
at the individual level, but also at the societal level, and even for the
entire species.  Proper diet and nutrient
intake are crucial to wellness.  Wellness
is crucial to happiness.  Happiness is
the stuff that makes life worthwhile.  </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>The Food is Medicine Project is an idea that the foods we put into our bodies can be highly effective medicines for treating a vast majority of the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual diseases currently plaguing the human population.  We recognize these illnesses as being a major obstacle preventing many of our human brothers and sisters from leading fulfilling lives.  We believe that Hippocrates’ notion to “let food be our medicine and medicine be our food” is a crucial piece of the puzzle as to why, when our technological and intellectual abilities are more developed than ever, our basic wellness is in its worst decline.  From the perspective of this philosophy it’s evident that part of the problem is our disconnection from the natural systems than sustain our existence.  We have forgotten that food is medicine, but we can remember, and we hope to help individuals in their personal healing processes through service and education.</p>
<p>Now more than ever our food is at the focus of many controversies.  Somewhere under the heap of arguments about vegetarianism, the omnivore’s dilemma, large scale industrial farming, GMOs, organic, labeling laws, free trade, high fructose corn syrup, cattle industry standards, poultry industry standards, the FDA, the raw milk controversy, celiac disease and a plethora of other food allergies and intolerances, there is a forgotten philosophy.  At the root of these issues is the forgotten concept that food is more than just fuel, eating is more than just a habitual activity, and that meals are more than just an opportunity to gather and socialize. </p>
<p><b>Why We Chose Crowd Funding</b></p>
<p>Since it's our philosophy that we are all
irrefutably connected, we are excited to participate in the crowd funding.  No other economic medium has ever existed
that makes it so easy for us to spread our love and energy to so many others as efficiently.  The potential to connect to
millions of individuals who may be interested in supporting your cause is
nothing short of magic.  It reinforces
part of our philosophy that there is an abundance of love and universal support
for people when they’re pursuing their personal legends.  There are many projects out there that we at
The Food is Medicine Project support and wish to see succeed, and we support
many of them financially by making small pledges.  In honesty and vulnerability, we cannot
downplay the discomfort experienced by the ego when campaigning for funds from
family, friends and strangers.  It is
uncomfortable to pull back the curtain, show the world your dreams and ask for
their support.  But in our desires to be
connected, to heal the gap of separation between our individual selves and our
human brothers and sisters, we support this economic bridge called crowd
funding and are grateful for the opportunity to participate.  “The hand that is open to give is also open
to receive.”  May we give and receive
freely with ever accumulating love and respect for each other, our dreams and
our projects.</p>
<p><b>More About The Food Is Medicine Project</b></p>
<p>The word Medicine comes from the
Latin nouns 'medi', meaning ""middle, center, or balance point,"" and
'cinus', meaning ""ruin, destruction, or chaos.""  The word Medicine actually translates
""to bring balance to that which was once in ruin,"" or ""to return
to balance that which has fallen into chaos.""  Our philosophy is that Food IS Medicine!  We believe that food is one of the most
fundamental ways to restore balance to our chaotic lives, and our goal is to
share the things we have learned about the healing power of eating with a holistic
perspective!</p>
<p>The relationship
between our bodies and our food is fundamental, yet very complex, and we
believe that each person's specific needs are very different.  For example, some people might benefit from a
vegan diet, while for others a vegan diet may lack the nutritional content for
the body and/or mind to operate optimally. 
The primary mission of The Food is Medicine Project to encourage
individuals toward self-discovery, to help individuals to understand how
the food they eat affects their specific biology and physiology. We believe
that many illnesses, physical and mental, either have their root origins in, or
can be addressed by, making adjustments in the diet. We have personally

</div></div>","We believe in the healing power of food.  We believe that food can heal the body, the mind, the soul, and the spirit.  We believe that food is a gift from the divine maternal spirit of the planet, and that by learning about our connection to the Earth through our food, we can heal ourselves, creating more space for love, joy, compassion, and gratitude.
About this Campaign
The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds
which will be used for purchasing acreage in the greater Winston Salem area and
developing the infrastructure needed for an operational retreat center.  The retreat center will be a resilient,
self-sustaining property designed in accordance with permaculture principles,
and with an emphasis on physical, emotional and spiritual healing.  A few farm activities and retreat topics
we’re expecting include permaculture design, natural buildings, biofuels, solar
harvesting, hydroelectric and wind power generation, earthworks, grafting and
tree propagation, vegetable production, bee keeping, meat production, food
forestry, silvo-pasturing, coppicing, seed saving, seed germination, husbandry,
cheese making, composting, vermiculture, aquaponics, soil remediation, mushroom
cultivation, medicinal herb cultivation, essential oil distillation,
aromatherapy,  yoga, meditation, Reiki,
energy healing, qi gong, acupuncture, massage therapy, juice therapy, music
therapy, nature therapy, probiotics, traditional Chinese medicine, and
biodynamics.  Retreat topics will be
non-sectarian.  We hope to host our first
retreat in September, 2016.
At this time we recognize that
now more than ever, it’s absolutely necessary for our human society to
reestablish the connection to our food. 
Our goal is to become stewards of the Earth and to reach out and connect
with our fellow suffering humans.  This
idea, The Food is Medicine Project, creates a bridge that can lead to balance,
at the individual level, but also at the societal level, and even for the
entire species.  Proper diet and nutrient
intake are crucial to wellness.  Wellness
is crucial to happiness.  Happiness is
the stuff that makes life worthwhile.  

Who We Are
The Food is Medicine Project is an idea that the foods we put into our bodies can be highly effective medicines for treating a vast majority of the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual diseases currently plaguing the human population.  We recognize these illnesses as being a major obstacle preventing many of our human brothers and sisters from leading fulfilling lives.  We believe that Hippocrates’ notion to “let food be our medicine and medicine be our food” is a crucial piece of the puzzle as to why, when our technological and intellectual abilities are more developed than ever, our basic wellness is in its worst decline.  From the perspective of this philosophy it’s evident that part of the problem is our disconnection from the natural systems than sustain our existence.  We have forgotten that food is medicine, but we can remember, and we hope to help individuals in their personal healing processes through service and education.
Now more than ever our food is at the focus of many controversies.  Somewhere under the heap of arguments about vegetarianism, the omnivore’s dilemma, large scale industrial farming, GMOs, organic, labeling laws, free trade, high fructose corn syrup, cattle industry standards, poultry industry standards, the FDA, the raw milk controversy, celiac disease and a plethora of other food allergies and intolerances, there is a forgotten philosophy.  At the root of these issues is the forgotten concept that food is more than just fuel, eating is more than just a habitual activity, and that meals are more than just an opportunity to gather and socialize. 
Why We Chose Crowd Funding
Since it's our philosophy that we are all
irrefutably connected, we are excited to participate in the crowd funding.  No other economic medium has ever existed
that makes it so easy for us to spread our love and energy to so many others as efficiently.  The potential to connect to
millions of individuals who may be interested in supporting your cause is
nothing short of magic.  It reinforces
part of our philosophy that there is an abundance of love and universal support
for people when they’re pursuing their personal legends.  There are many projects out there that we at
The Food is Medicine Project support and wish to see succeed, and we support
many of them financially by making small pledges.  In honesty and vulnerability, we cannot
downplay the discomfort experienced by the ego when campaigning for funds from
family, friends and strangers.  It is
uncomfortable to pull back the curtain, show the world your dreams and ask for
their support.  But in our desires to be
connected, to heal the gap of separation between our individual selves and our
human brothers and sisters, we support this economic bridge called crowd
funding and are grateful for the opportunity to participate.  “The hand that is open to give is also open
to receive.”  May we give and receive
freely with ever accumulating love and respect for each other, our dreams and
our projects.
More About The Food Is Medicine Project
The word Medicine comes from the
Latin nouns 'medi', meaning ""middle, center, or balance point,"" and
'cinus', meaning ""ruin, destruction, or chaos.""  The word Medicine actually translates
""to bring balance to that which was once in ruin,"" or ""to return
to balance that which has fallen into chaos.""  Our philosophy is that Food IS Medicine!  We believe that food is one of the most
fundamental ways to restore balance to our chaotic lives, and our goal is to
share the things we have learned about the healing power of eating with a holistic
perspective!
The relationship
between our bodies and our food is fundamental, yet very complex, and we
believe that each person's specific needs are very different.  For example, some people might benefit from a
vegan diet, while for others a vegan diet may lack the nutritional content for
the body and/or mind to operate optimally. 
The primary mission of The Food is Medicine Project to encourage
individuals toward self-discovery, to help individuals to understand how
the food they eat affects their specific biology and physiology. We believe
that many illnesses, physical and mental, either have their root origins in, or
can be addressed by, making adjustments in the diet. We have personally
discovered that our own physical and mental well-being at any given time is most
affected by the quality of our last few meals. A comprehensive process of
discovery should be very scientific and should take into account a person's
intuitions about their own dietary needs, as only an individual can be fully
aware of how his or her body is being affected. Only through an ongoing process
of procedure and observation can a person discern their own bio-specificity,
and by extension, optimal physical and mental performance.

<h3>HOW AM I ?</h3>
<p>To be born and raised in place considered to be one of the most dangerous places with limited resources and came up with such a brilliant product is what they call "" REAL SUCCESS "". MAJD MASHHARAWI is a Civil Engineer from Gaza who is capable of changing the stereotype about women in Gaza which stated that women are not suitable for engineering major as it requires hardworking and muscular abilities. She has faced rejection with huge determination and strong belief that ladies are the next leaders of the world.</p>
<p>During her life in university, she focused on understanding engineering in a creative way. One resource was not enough to feed their hunger of education. She is very passionate and dedicate  towards her dream. She is always promising that she will leave this world making an unforgettable change and she already did !</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED?</h3>
<p>1. Ash Problem: The world in the last few decades depends on Coal combustion to generate electricity. This process results an enormous amounts of Ash. This unusable by-product powder buried underground and causing direct pollution to the ground water as it permeates quickly through soil particles. Paying attention to the environmental condition attached to the coal combustion here in Gaza Strip, more than <strong>7</strong> tons are produced weekly by Alfakhoora places ( These place are burning coal and wood to generate high degrees of temperature for drying food pots)  and this leads to uncontrolled environmental issue.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479911312/byipadgkkrryzkonfisq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>2. Quality, Price and Weight of local ordinary blocks: As result of people continues focus on the blocks prices in Gaza as construction material especially the cement are very expensive and there are many political restrictions and  SIEGE since 2006 , the price will be very high and so on most blocks manufacturing plants produce building blocks under estimated standards only to make more profits with very low quality of those building blocks. In addition, there is no lightweight blocks in Gaza as it is prohibited and not allowed to be exported form outside!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479911337/aduua6wqeypohjwrsfvi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>IS GREENCAKE THE SOLUTION?</h3>
<p>GreenCake blocks are the ultimate solution for these environmental problems as they consist of Ash which replaces the Aggregate and sand in ordinary blocks as a filler material. In addition, this powdered material gives many unique characteristics to the blocks such as creating a lighter blocks and much stronger ones. Moreover, the cost of the ordinary block is more than double the cost of GreenCake blocks. GreenCake blocks are also environmentally friendly blocks with high quality and low cost.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>VISION AND MISSION !</h3>
<p>VISION : To use construction and look after our environment.</p>
<p>MISSION: Creating an environmentally friendly building blocks based on the disposal coal and wood ash given that more than 600 miliion tons of ash are produced annually in Gaza.</p>

<h3>WHERE GREENCAKE WERE AND WHERE DID IT REACH !</h3>
<p>THE GREENCAKE JOURNEY FROM PAPER TO BLOCK ( BETWEEN RESEARCH AND APPLICATION )</p>
<p>1- GreenCake participated in a start-up incubator called Mobaderoon III project: Mobaderoon gave the team a lot of knowledge about the world of entrepreneurship, it opened many doors for them to establish the first prototype of GreenCake. Our team became more familiar and involved with the business environment and had meetings with many experts that provided the feedback needed in order to maintain success.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479912140/pppxzg2wbd9vufc6sxrl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>2- MIT semi-finals</p>
<p>To move forward with the project, the team participated in MIT competition for Arab start-up projects and their project were selected among 70 participants to the semi-finalists of the competition, let me mention that more than five thousands entrepreneurs applied and only 70 were selected!. So therefore, this was a great boost to our GreenCake team. Unfortunately luck is not always on your side and the team were not able to travel because of the political situation and borders to complete the competition.</p>

<p>3- Japan-Gaza Innovation Challenge : by 1st August, 2016 Majd decided to stop the project after all the setbacks she had faced. Miki – Majd’s friend - had advised her to apply for another challenge in Gaza held and funded by a Japanese team ( Japan Gaza Innovation Challenge). She attended the boot camp that they prepared and it was EXTREMELY inspiring ! The Japanese gave her the bright light of hope again, and she WON THE FIRST PRIZE !</p>

<p>For many decades, Gaza has been subjected to extreme situations such as three wars in 6 years and forced siege for 10 years. This has created a product and material shortage in the strip especially with respect to the construction materials, where the demand of building units is increasing annually. For example, the demand of building blocks has reached up to 40,000 blocks daily.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, with Gaza's situation, the world is facing a major environmental impact due to the inefficient action caused by industries around the globe. One of the major contributions in this environmental catastrophes is coal combustion, which results huge amounts of ash that are disposed of without concern for the environment and Gaza gets a share of 6 tons/weekly !</p>
<p>Because of the fact that Majd is a civil engineer, she is able to reunite environment and construction which has been one of my goals in this life thanks to her interests into material science. And to achieve this objective, she had to understand our construction conditions in Gaza strip and analyze it needs. This has motivated her friend Rawan as well as herself to create an urgent solution that could be adaptable, affordable, durable and always available to compensate the market gap. It all begins with our senior project ideas, which was mainly about light weight building blocks such as Aircrete blocks.</p>
<p>But it wasn't satisfying enough for Majd to apply something that had been already used and produced before. So she started her journey of research and it resulted with the birth of GreenCake blocks are mainly dependent on ash derived from coal combustion with other additives materials .</p>
<p>Despite the accomplishment we have reached with GreenCake, the road of it was full of obstacles and failures. However, every time there is a setback she is reminded that in order to achieve success we have to overcome these obstacles and delete the word failure from dictionary.</p>
<p>Replacing aggregate and sand with ash allowed the block to acquire its lightweight feature that can help Gazan to expand their areas and heights of buildings. Moreover, the price of GreenCake block is less than the ordinary block because of the efficient use of cement. I am seeking to find an alternative of cement and get rid of it from the block mixture as the price of it is increasing due to the siege.</p>
<p>When the team first got the minimum required strength of standard building blocks, Majd was overcome with happiness to know that she just got one step closer to her dream and goal in this life, which is leaving a fingerprint and making the world a better place to live in, starting from developing her own home country Gaza.</p>
<p>The journey of thousands miles starts with one step, she took a chance and took a step to show the world the power of a Palestinian woman as a nation builder and developer. I believe in that there are no limitations to our abilities if we use them significantly to serve our world.</p>
<h3>HOW MUCH DO WE NEED AND FOR WHAT !</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose : </strong>We want to develop the GreenCake block and do further testing in order to establish a mini production line for GREENCAKE in Gaza and we are seeking to collect the required amount of fund to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><strong>Production Flow chart :</strong> Here is the process of creating the GreenCake</p>

Paying attention to the environmental condition attached to the coal combustion here in Gaza Strip, more than 7 tons are produced weekly by Alfakhoora places ( These place are burning coal and wood to generate high degrees of temperature for drying food pots)  and this leads to uncontrolled environmental issue.  

2. Quality, Price and Weight of local ordinary blocks: As result of people continues focus on the blocks prices in Gaza as construction material especially the cement are very expensive and there are many political restrictions and  SIEGE since 2006 , the price will be very high and so on most blocks manufacturing plants produce building blocks under estimated standards only to make more profits with very low quality of those building blocks. In addition, there is no lightweight blocks in Gaza as it is prohibited and not allowed to be exported form outside!

 
IS GREENCAKE THE SOLUTION?
GreenCake blocks are the ultimate solution for these environmental problems as they consist of Ash which replaces the Aggregate and sand in ordinary blocks as a filler material. In addition, this powdered material gives many unique characteristics to the blocks such as creating a lighter blocks and much stronger ones. Moreover, the cost of the ordinary block is more than double the cost of GreenCake blocks. GreenCake blocks are also environmentally friendly blocks with high quality and low cost.

 
VISION AND MISSION !
VISION : To use construction and look after our environment.
MISSION: Creating an environmentally friendly building blocks based on the disposal coal and wood ash given that more than 600 miliion tons of ash are produced annually in Gaza.

 
 
WHERE GREENCAKE WERE AND WHERE DID IT REACH !
THE GREENCAKE JOURNEY FROM PAPER TO BLOCK ( BETWEEN RESEARCH AND APPLICATION )
1- GreenCake participated in a start-up incubator called Mobaderoon III project: Mobaderoon gave the team a lot of knowledge about the world of entrepreneurship, it opened many doors for them to establish the first prototype of GreenCake. Our team became more familiar and involved with the business environment and had meetings with many experts that provided the feedback needed in order to maintain success.

 
2- MIT semi-finals
To move forward with the project, the team participated in MIT competition for Arab start-up projects and their project were selected among 70 participants to the semi-finalists of the competition, let me mention that more than five thousands entrepreneurs applied and only 70 were selected!. So therefore, this was a great boost to our GreenCake team. Unfortunately luck is not always on your side and the team were not able to travel because of the political situation and borders to complete the competition.


3- Japan-Gaza Innovation Challenge : by 1st August, 2016 Majd decided to stop the project after all the setbacks she had faced. Miki – Majd’s friend - had advised her to apply for another challenge in Gaza held and funded by a Japanese team ( Japan Gaza Innovation Challenge). She attended the boot camp that they prepared and it was EXTREMELY inspiring ! The Japanese gave her the bright light of hope again, and she WON THE FIRST PRIZE !

She was very happy to be a part of this venture with these talented Japanese people. They were always supporting her and gave her hope and power to continue this long and hard journey. She is going to go to Japan in March to get training there.

 
NHK TALKED ABOUT US ♥

 
4- Our first practical construction was SEPTEMBER 2016 .
A man called Mr.Basheer contacted Majd and asked for blocks for his external wall which was (16X2.8X2) and (20X2.8X2) And here is the process:
A. Producing the blocks in the factory we rented for a week



B. Lifting the blocks to the Targeted place 

C. Starting building with GREENCAKE




And the Final one is :  

 
5- ZINC video : Here she is, with a video reaching more than 9.5 Million views !! to give hope to Gazan and the whole world that we are capable of making the IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE.

WHY GREENCAKE AND NOT ORDINARY BLOCKS !

♥ TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERNS ♥
♥ BE THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD Gandhi ♥
For many decades, Gaza has been subjected to extreme situations such as three wars in 6 years and forced siege for 10 years. This has created a product and material shortage in the strip especially with respect to the construction materials, where the demand of building units is increasing annually. For example, the demand of building blocks has reached up to 40,000 blocks daily.
Simultaneously, with Gaza's situation, the world is facing a major environmental impact due to the inefficient action caused by industries around the globe. One of the major contributions in this environmental catastrophes is coal combustion, which results huge amounts of ash that are disposed of without concern for the environment and Gaza gets a share of 6 tons/weekly !
Because of the fact that Majd is a civil engineer, she is able to reunite environment and construction which has been one of my goals in this life thanks to her interests into material science. And to achieve this objective, she had to understand our construction conditions in Gaza strip and analyze it needs. This has motivated her friend Rawan as well as herself to create an urgent solution that could be adaptable, affordable, durable and always available to compensate the market gap. It all begins with our senior project ideas, which was mainly about light weight building blocks such as Aircrete blocks.
But it wasn't satisfying enough for Majd to apply something that had been already used and produced before. So she started her journey of research and it resulted with the birth of GreenCake blocks are mainly dependent on ash derived from coal combustion with other additives materials .
Despite the accomplishment we have reached with GreenCake, the road of it was full of obstacles and failures. However, every time there is a setback she is reminded that in order to achieve success we have to overcome these obstacles and delete the word failure from dictionary.
Replacing aggregate and sand with ash allowed the block to acquire its lightweight feature that can help Gazan to expand their areas and heights of buildings. Moreover, the price of GreenCake block is less than the ordinary block because of the efficient use of cement. I am seeking to find an alternative of cement and get rid of it from the block mixture as the price of it is increasing due to the siege.
When the team first got the minimum required strength of standard building blocks, Majd was overcome with happiness to know that she just got one step closer to her dream and goal in this life, which is leaving a fingerprint and making the world a better place to live in, starting from developing her own home country Gaza.
The journey of thousands miles starts with one step, she took a chance and took a step to show the world the power of a Palestinian woman as a nation builder and developer. I believe in that there are no limitations to our abilities if we use them significantly to serve our world.
HOW MUCH DO WE NEED AND FOR WHAT !
Purpose : We want to develop the GreenCake block and do further testing in order to establish a mini production line for GREENCAKE in Gaza and we are seeking to collect the required amount of fund to achieve this goal.
Production Flow chart : Here is the process of creating the GreenCake

Budget Required to sustain the production line for the first year of production: 
​- Registration fees + insurance = 3,000 $
- Renting a plant ( with mixer + full automatic molding machine + forklift + molds ) = 10,000 $
- A plant for making blocks by using steam and high pressure= 10,000 $.
- Sieving machine ( locally manufactured ) = 5,000 $ 
- Raw materials for the first three months of working = 20,000 $
- Consultation and Technical supervision expenses = 5,000 $
- Marketing fees = 2,000 $

<p>(<i>All contributors will have their name on the Factory walls</i>)</p>
<p><strong><u>Why this project is a true-value ?</u></strong></p>
<p>As the ecological challenge is vital for the Planet, , unlike the whole constructions made nowdays, we don’t use any manufactured or processed material throught grey energy nor fossile ressources for our build. For example : for producing insulation such as polystyrene, glass wool, bricks…, manufacturies consume  a lot of fossil energy.</p>
<p>Walls will be built differently according to whether you are in Asia, France or anywhere. Indeed, in order to obtain the best insulation, several technical factors are to be met depending on, among other things, hygometry.</p>
<p>These houses are in fact like <strong>breathing</strong> and living organic matters, providing <strong>self-regulation</strong> and<strong> very law energy consumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Severe lack of housing is being increasingly recognised everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Implement our project would be the beginning of an adequate response to this shortage.</p>
<p>For this design could be duplicated as may be necessary.</p>
<p>Unemployment is a scourge affecting our society.</p>
<p>Our concept involves implementing training programs for new construction professions.</p>
<p>To get our project started, about <strong>1500 jobs</strong> will be created and replicated in each new plant.</p>
<p>Nowdays, a large part of population develops allergies. By 2050, the specialists announce that one in two inhabitant in the world will have allergies. Nowdays, some of these are caused by construction materials. Our technique using natural and unprocessed materials, can therefore eliminate any allergy linked with such phenomenom.</p>

<p><strong><u>All we need :</u></strong></p>
<p>The cost of constructing a plant is 75 000 000, 00 EUR (84 500 000 USD.)</p>
<p>If we obtain at least 20 % of the amount , for a total of 15 000 000,00 EUR (16 906 000 USD) (plus 10 per cent of Indiegogo charge and banking costs), we could borrow from banks and obtain financial guarantees. If we get more, we will have less money to borrow to complete easily our project. We will also request financial help from the Foundation and the NGOs. At the same time, we are working with a law practice specializing in fundraising.</p>

(House realized by New eRa)
Hello everyone !
First of all, I would like to thank all of you for considering my project !
Have a pleasant reading ! 
Who we are :

(Julian speaking)
Born into a family of several generations builders, my father for 40 years and myself for 10 years, we have perfected construction and rehabilitation works, Through time and hard work, we’re proud to say that we have achieved a form of respect from our peers
We try our best to always be on the cutting edge of technology ; honed from practical experience, our technique has been sharpened over time.
This is how we have examined and then developed for 10 years our ecological houses building process. The specified process which obtained the french approbations and the building compulsory insurance. We have already built several homes like this by craftsmen and our construction performances outreach french standards.
Fire tests established by french institutes led to positive results and concluded that the resistance is higher than traditional constructions.
 
The New Era’s project :

 Construction of an eco-factory with a manufacturing capacity which may vary according to the need, from 1000 to 3000 houses per year.
This factory will be built with natural materials and the factory could higlhy reduce the construction cost and to make accessible the houses to the greatest number of people.
Wastes will be used by a new generation gasification plant with very strong profitability for the energy and ecological production able to supply this plant and vehicles.
Manufacturing, delivery and assembly of houses whose parts are ready to be assembled.
The main objective is to have a local production : not to import any raw material (wood, straw, land). There should be no loss.
Straw is a waste often burnt, so it shall be recovered.
Harvested trees for timber exploitation shall be replanted. Moreover for the wood, we will only work with Forest loggers with a label like Pan-european forest certification (PEFC) , at any rate, who respect the 9th of july 2001 forestry law.

Why this project is a true-value ?
As the ecological challenge is vital for the Planet, , unlike the whole constructions made nowdays, we don’t use any manufactured or processed material throught grey energy nor fossile ressources for our build. For example : for producing insulation such as polystyrene, glass wool, bricks…, manufacturies consume  a lot of fossil energy.
Walls will be built differently according to whether you are in Asia, France or anywhere. Indeed, in order to obtain the best insulation, several technical factors are to be met depending on, among other things, hygometry.
These houses are in fact like breathing and living organic matters, providing self-regulation and very law energy consumption.
Severe lack of housing is being increasingly recognised everywhere in the world.
Implement our project would be the beginning of an adequate response to this shortage.
For this design could be duplicated as may be necessary.
Unemployment is a scourge affecting our society.
Our concept involves implementing training programs for new construction professions.
To get our project started, about 1500 jobs will be created and replicated in each new plant.
Nowdays, a large part of population develops allergies. By 2050, the specialists announce that one in two inhabitant in the world will have allergies. Nowdays, some of these are caused by construction materials. Our technique using natural and unprocessed materials, can therefore eliminate any allergy linked with such phenomenom.

All we need :
The cost of constructing a plant is 75 000 000, 00 EUR (84 500 000 USD.)
If we obtain at least 20 % of the amount , for a total of 15 000 000,00 EUR (16 906 000 USD) (plus 10 per cent of Indiegogo charge and banking costs), we could borrow from banks and obtain financial guarantees. If we get more, we will have less money to borrow to complete easily our project. We will also request financial help from the Foundation and the NGOs. At the same time, we are working with a law practice specializing in fundraising.
In case we have less financial support, we will manufacture a smaller plant but if we obtain more, we could open more factories in several countries.

Bonjour à tous! 
Tout d'abord, merci pour toute l'attention que vous porterez à notre projet! Bonne lecture!
Qui sommes-nous?

(paroles de Julian)Issus d’une famille de bâtisseurs depuis plusieurs générations, mon père depuis 40 ans et moi-même depuis 10 ans, nous maîtrisons parfaitement les ouvrages de construction et rénovation et sommes reconnus professionnellement par nos paires. (www.zenithmaitredoeuvre.com)Toujours à la pointe des nouveautés, forts de notre expérience sur le terrain, notre technique s’est affûtée au cours du temps. C’est ainsi que durant une dizaine d’année nous avons analysé, étudié puis développé notre processus de construction de maisons écologiques. Processus qui a obtenu les approbations de la  France et les assurances obligatoires pour la construction. Nous avons déjà construit de façon artisanale plusieurs maisons de ce type et les performances de notre construction vont au delà des normes en vigueur françaises.Les tests  au feu établis par des instituts français ont été concluants et ont démontré que la résistance est supérieure aux constructions traditionnelles.Le projet New eRa :Construction d’une usine écologique dont la capacité de fabrication pourra varier selon le besoin, entre 1000 à 3000 maisons par an.La construction de cette usine se fera avec des matériaux naturels et l'usine permettra de réduire fortement le coût de construction et de rendre les maisons accessibles au plus grand nombre.Les déchets produits seront utilisés par une centrale de gazéification nouvelle génération à très forte rentabilité pour la production énergétique écologique permettant d’alimenter l’usine et les véhicules.Fabrication, livraison et montage des maisons qui sortent en pièces prêtes à être assemblées.Le but final étant de ne rien importer pour ce qui est de la matière première (bois, paille, terre) et de n’avoir aucune perte, nous devrons tout produire localement.La paille est un déchet souvent brûlé, elle sera donc valorisée.Les arbres récoltés pour l’exploitation du bois devront être replantés. De plus pour le bois, nous ne travaillerons qu'avec des exploitants forestiers ayant un label style ""PEFC"", en tous cas, respectant la loi forestière du 9 juillet 2001 (http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/dossiers/foret.asp).PEFC: http://www.pefc-france.org/(Chaque contributeur aura son nom inscrit sur le mur de l'usine)Pourquoi ce projet a-t-il une vraie valeur ?Le défit écologique étant vital pour la Planète, contrairement à l’ensemble des constructions faites aujourd’hui, notre procédé n’emploie aucun matériau fabriqué ou transformé par le biais d’énergie grise ou fossile. Exemple : pour fabriquer des isolants tels que polystyrène, laine de verre, brique, ..., les usines consomment énormément d’énergie fossile.Les murs ne seront pas construits de la même façon selon que l’on soit en Asie, en France ou ailleurs. En effet plusieurs paramètres doivent être respectés en fonction entre autres de l’hygrométrie afin d’obtenir la meilleur isolation. En effet, ces maisons sont comme des êtres vivants qui respirent, ce qui permet l’autorégulation et une consommation énergétique très faible.Le manque cruel de logements partout dans le monde est reconnu. Pouvoir donner le jour à notre projet serait le commencement d’une réponse appropriée à cette pénurie. Car en effet, ce modèle pourra être dupliqué autant de fois que nécessaire.Le chômage également est un mal de notre société. Notre concept prévoit la mise en œuvre de formation aux nouveaux métiers. Pour démarrer notre projet, 1500 postes environ seront créés, 1500 postes qui seront dupliqués à chaque nouvelle usine.De nos jours une forte partie de la population développe des allergies. D’ici 2050 les spécialistes annoncent que dans le monde un habitant sur deux développera des allergies. De nos jours certaines d’entre elles sont dues aux matériaux employés dans la construction. Notre procédé n’utilisant que des matériaux naturels et non traités permet donc d’éliminer toute allergie liée à ce phénomène.(Maison réalisée par New eRa) Ce dont nous avons besoin:Le coût de la construction de l’usine est de 75 000 000,00 d’euros (84 532 500,00 USD).Obtenir un minimum de 20% de la somme, soit 15 000 000.00 d’euros (16 906 000 USD)(plus 10% de frais Indiegogo et bancaire) nous permettrait d’emprunter auprès des banques, d’obtenir des garanties financières. Si nous obtenons plus, cela nous fera moins d’argent à emprunter et cela facilitera la réalisation du projet. Nous allons également solliciter le concours de fondations et d’ONG. Nous travaillons en parallèle  avec un cabinet d’avocats spécialisés dans les recherches de fonds.Dans le cas où nous obtenons moins, nous réaliserons une usine plus petite. Si nous obtenons plus de fonds nous ouvrirons d'autres usines dans d'autres pays. PRIX DE CONSTRUCTION DE L'USINE:- TERRASSEMENT + VRD- CHARPENTE TOITURE         - FONDATION + DALLAGE - MURS - POSE - ENDUIT - PLOMBERIE + AIR + FLUIDE USINE  - ELECTRICITE USINE PARTIE PRODUCTION  - ELECTRICITE USINE PARTIE STOCKAGE  - ELECTRICITE STOCKAGE - MATÉRIELS MENUISERIES FABRICATION FENËTRES,- PLAN DE TRAVAIL CUISINE,  PORTES- RIA INCENDIE USINE + STOCKAGEY compris stockage des eaux de pluie + pompes sous le bâtiment de stockage- GROUPES ELECTROGENES- LOGISTIQUE (camions – tractopelles - bus de ramassage ...)- ETAGE BUREAUX, ECOLE 10 500 M² - UNITES DE FABRICATION 5 - HONORAIRES PERSONNELS DE FORMATION                                                                               + Logements et Divers pour 1an  - CENTRALE ENERGETIQUE POUR L'ALIMENTATION DES CINQ CHAINES DE PRODUCTION - BÂTIMENT STOCKAGE pour UNE ANNÉE 75 000 M²                                                                           - HONORAIRES ETUDE GESTION     ====================== PRIX TTC     75 000 000.00 €                        84 532 500,00 USD",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>How Clever Buoy Works</h2>
<p>The monitoring system is designed to be deployed beyond the surf zone and utilizes multi beam sonar transducers that are mounted on the ocean floor coupled with newly developed detection software to scan for marine life.  The system creates a “virtual net” at the deployment locations and once an object is detected in the area, the software interrogates the target’s swimming pattern to determine the type of object and potential species. <br/><br/>If the target is determined to exhibit shark like movement patterns, information is transmitted to lifeguards within seconds notifying them of the target and the location via a real-time mobile application with automated notifications and warning information.<br/> <br/>Clever Buoy™ is unique in the market as a viable commercially-available shark mitigation method, using non-invasive technology solutions suitable to protect high intensity surf zones. The stability and robustness of the current Clever Buoy™ platform has been verified to sustainably operate in open ocean conditions 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, autonomously monitoring marine life and alerting the presence of large animals which could be a threat to beach users. </p>

So that you know, $2 extra will be going to the campaign and I apologize for the inconvenience. The perk includes an extra sticker due to this.</p><p>Exploitation, through targeted as well as incidental catch, is one of the main global threats facing shark survival. Over-fishing is driving sharks to the brink of extinction - with many populations down by 80 percent. Tens of millions are killed each year for their meat, fins, liver, and other products, as many fisheries are unregulated and catch are significantly under-reported. Bycatch – catching sharks incidentally and indiscriminately while fishing for other commercial species – poses a significant threat to sharks.  Finning – the removal of shark fins and discard of the shark’s body at sea - is often associated with shark over-fishing, as keeping only the fins aboard the vessel allows fishermen to kill many more sharks than if they were required to bring back the entire animal. Fueling this practice is the fact that shark fins yield a much higher price than shark meat, providing an economic incentive for the wasteful and indefensible practice of finning. (Sourced from projectaware.org).</p><p>The annual volume for fin imports decreased 5% (from 17,682 tonnes (t) in 2000 to 16,815 t in 2011). This is good news and SharkFinShirts.com was conceived to continue to decrease this number. However, the annual volume for shark meat (including skate and rays) imports increased by 42% (from was 85,710 t in 2000 to 121,641 t in 2011). This is why we are pairing with Project AWARE, so that we can address the whole issue. The money raised is to save the whole shark, not just the fins.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520045874/zvfu9ztngsgqgkyuyknu.png"" src=""""/></p><p>My name is Michael O'Hearne.

This is for international. Unfortunately, the IndieGoGo site will not let us change the domestic pricing because the campaign is live. So that you know, $2 extra will be going to the campaign and I apologize for the inconvenience. The perk includes an extra sticker due to this.Exploitation, through targeted as well as incidental catch, is one of the main global threats facing shark survival. Over-fishing is driving sharks to the brink of extinction - with many populations down by 80 percent. Tens of millions are killed each year for their meat, fins, liver, and other products, as many fisheries are unregulated and catch are significantly under-reported. Bycatch – catching sharks incidentally and indiscriminately while fishing for other commercial species – poses a significant threat to sharks.  Finning – the removal of shark fins and discard of the shark’s body at sea - is often associated with shark over-fishing, as keeping only the fins aboard the vessel allows fishermen to kill many more sharks than if they were required to bring back the entire animal. Fueling this practice is the fact that shark fins yield a much higher price than shark meat, providing an economic incentive for the wasteful and indefensible practice of finning. (Sourced from projectaware.org).The annual volume for fin imports decreased 5% (from 17,682 tonnes (t) in 2000 to 16,815 t in 2011). This is good news and SharkFinShirts.com was conceived to continue to decrease this number. However, the annual volume for shark meat (including skate and rays) imports increased by 42% (from was 85,710 t in 2000 to 121,641 t in 2011). This is why we are pairing with Project AWARE, so that we can address the whole issue. The money raised is to save the whole shark, not just the fins.My name is Michael O'Hearne. I appreciate you taking the time to read over this campaign and hope that this page, started on 2/22/18, inflamed your desire to learn more. Awareness of this issue is the first step.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Boghill Centre is a holistic retreat centre in the West of Ireland with over 25 years’ experience in catering for groups both large and small. Our focus is on eco-sustainability and environmental and spiritual education.  We try to create a safe space for workshops in the areas of meditation, team-building, healing, self-improvement and music.<br/><br/>We work with volunteers  and we have work-guests from all age groups and walks of life that help us with the running of the Centre. This is a conscious decision to give people the opportunity to learn and experience sustainability, organic farming, and to give them opportunities to broaden their world-view.</p>
<p>This year we decided to turn Boghill into a charity. We intend to use this new status to grow and to better serve our existing and new clients. This crowd funding campaign and your contributions will enable us to take great steps towards self-sufficiency, to broaden our positive environmental impact, and to improve on the relaxing, high-quality service we are known for.<br/> </p>

<p></p><p>Eco Bee 
Box - Mini Hive</p>
<p>Sustain-able 
backyard beekeeping has not existed....until now. Our American-made, 
mini hive is a natural easy way to raise bees and queens. This universal system works 
with any style of beekeeping equipment. Easy for children, beginners, 
or advanced beekeepers to use, the mini hive is an excellent way to learn, raise and 
sustain bee colonies. Mini hives are the missing link in beekeeping. <br/></p><p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FW6cVKUrh9WE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DW6cVKUrh9WE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FW6cVKUrh9WE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>Sustaining colonies from season to season is a problem all beekeepers face. Some colonies will fail in the first year while others excel. The key to success  is duplicating local survivor colonies that have desirable, familiar traits.  The mini hive encourages this kind of sustainable beekeeping.</p>
<p>Every bee colony contains bacteria 
and microscopic life that lives in a delicate balance with 
the bees. Each hive has its own unique, dynamic ecosystem. When teaching beekeepers to create new 
colonies, I show how to copy and transfer the the ecosystem to the new hive with the comb 
and bees. When a colony is joined with a queen at random, common with bee packages that include a queen from a different colony, the tolerance of two 
separate ecosystems can be difficult for the bees and the queen. <br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DUUIvXFm21Cu5zZmJLJ4tsfeQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZxxDgFh2P28%26list%3DUUIvXFm21Cu5zZmJLJ4tsfeQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZxxDgFh2P28%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>Solution: </p>
<p>The key to sustainable beekeeping is learning how to produce a locally grown queen who is adapted to the conditions in your area. Weak colonies get sick, 
abscond, swarm, and are attacked by other insects and rodents. A knowledgeable beekeeper can 
assist a colony in trouble immediately with a queen raised naturally with her working ecosystem. Using a mini hive makes providing a queen to a struggling colony simple. We're currently working on raising money for educational materials to teach backyard beekeepers how to raise queens and care for bees. These materials will include professional videos and will be available online, anywhere in the world, whenever a beekeeper needs them. <br/></p>
<p>The Eco Bee Box 
mini hive is an inexpensive, attractive, low-maintenance urban beehive. Small 
bee hives are common in nature and are good for bees because they make it easier to regulate 
the environment inside the hive such as  temperature, humidity, and defense. Mini hives can be 
suspended from a tree, placed in your garden, or used as support for 
your larger colonies. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1331033/files/20150327071932-11021116_10204431795488722_2368293853954163974_n.jpg?1427465972"" src="""" style=""width: 410.66px; height: 308px;""/></p>

Eco Bee 
Box - Mini Hive
Sustain-able 
backyard beekeeping has not existed....until now. Our American-made, 
mini hive is a natural easy way to raise bees and queens. This universal system works 
with any style of beekeeping equipment. Easy for children, beginners, 
or advanced beekeepers to use, the mini hive is an excellent way to learn, raise and 
sustain bee colonies. Mini hives are the missing link in beekeeping. 
Problem:
Sustaining colonies from season to season is a problem all beekeepers face. Some colonies will fail in the first year while others excel. The key to success  is duplicating local survivor colonies that have desirable, familiar traits.  The mini hive encourages this kind of sustainable beekeeping.
Every bee colony contains bacteria 
and microscopic life that lives in a delicate balance with 
the bees. Each hive has its own unique, dynamic ecosystem. When teaching beekeepers to create new 
colonies, I show how to copy and transfer the the ecosystem to the new hive with the comb 
and bees. When a colony is joined with a queen at random, common with bee packages that include a queen from a different colony, the tolerance of two 
separate ecosystems can be difficult for the bees and the queen. 
Solution: 
The key to sustainable beekeeping is learning how to produce a locally grown queen who is adapted to the conditions in your area. Weak colonies get sick, 
abscond, swarm, and are attacked by other insects and rodents. A knowledgeable beekeeper can 
assist a colony in trouble immediately with a queen raised naturally with her working ecosystem. Using a mini hive makes providing a queen to a struggling colony simple. We're currently working on raising money for educational materials to teach backyard beekeepers how to raise queens and care for bees. These materials will include professional videos and will be available online, anywhere in the world, whenever a beekeeper needs them. 
The Eco Bee Box 
mini hive is an inexpensive, attractive, low-maintenance urban beehive. Small 
bee hives are common in nature and are good for bees because they make it easier to regulate 
the environment inside the hive such as  temperature, humidity, and defense. Mini hives can be 
suspended from a tree, placed in your garden, or used as support for 
your larger colonies. 
An example of supporting a larger hive is this image showing how a mini frame can be used in a top--bar application.  The mini frame successfully introduced a capped queen to a hive that was killing every queen we added.  This mini frame also strengthened the usually weak comb frame.Application: An explanation of the mini hive. Learn to create 
your own second generation queen from a colony with traits you know and has which has survived 
the first year test.  Use this queen as you need in your apiary, and the mini 
hive will create a third generation queen naturally.  This way your queen has a 
pedigree you can trace. Colonies that survive more than a 
year or thrive without treatments are the survivor colonies that a beekeeper 
should focus on, rather than the colonies that are lost.  The mini hive is a tiny breeding ground similar to what is 
found in nature and is an excellent way to create a new, second generation

<h2>Greener, Cheaper, Faster and Safer</h2>
<p>See below how your contribution will help make the supply chain greener, cheaper, faster and safer so the products we all buy have a smaller carbon footprint.</p>
<h4>Greener: Reduce Deforestation by as much as 50%</h4>
The production of wooden <a href=""http://2waysupplychain.com/definitions/#pallets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pallets</a> alone consumes as much hardwood in the US, every year, as all other uses combined.  <b>Yes, every year up to half of all the trees cut down are used to make pallets! </b> Your contribution will help build a prototype to show the supply chain industry how they can eliminate the need for wooden pallets and still save money bringing products to your favorite retailer.<div>

<p>The Cargo Carousel modules would be pre-stocked with customers orders and swapped out as orders are picked up. These vending machines could be placed throughout the city so customers travel less to retrieve their orders reducing time and greenhouse gas emissions even further.</p>

<h3>Glen’s Journey</h3>
<p>Glen started his career in the engineering field back in the 70's when design was still done on a drafting table. When CAD (computer assisted design) came about Glen realized that he would have to go back to school either to learn CAD or another career. He chose accounting to improve his position in the ""business"" end of the engineering field and spent six years at night school in his pursuit (Glen understands perseverance).</p>
<p>Fast forward and we find Glen working on the design of a distribution center for a major retailing outfit in eastern Canada. It was here that Glen discovered the inner workings of supply chains and he was amazed at how antiquated and inefficient they were. Empty trucks lined up at the security gate, engines idling, waiting to pick up their loads and even more of them leaving empty after their deliveries. How could this be? Huge retailing operations with warehouses bigger than a million square feet each who are actually shipping more air than merchandise! With all their money and brainpower and this is the best they could do? Unbelievable! There has to be a better way. That's when Glen decided to go into business for himself.</p>
<h3>Glen Goes Green</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446792076/ockctovtvut59xmsj8nl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the early years before eBay, Overstock.com and the like had come into existence, Glen started a company selling <a href=""http://2waysupplychain.com/definitions/#distressed-inventory"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">distressed inventory</a> from his own 46,000 square foot warehouse. Distressed inventory are products that haven’t been sold in the retail stores and were being sent straight to landfills. He was being green by keeping literally tons of products out of landfills.</p>
<p>It was during this time that he learned the ropes of the supply and reverse chains and figured out a smarter way to move merchandise in both the supply and reverse chains at the same time! In 2012 Glen changed his focus and the Cargo Carousel System was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446791298/beyxtl6rq4ie7a5b5otw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Carmen Goes Green</h3>
<p>Which brings us to Glen’s wife, Carmen Munholland. When Glen explained this concept to her, she had a lot of questions. Such as... ""Is the supply chain really unsustainable? Is it something they can adopt easily? Does it make their job easier? Is it cost effective?  Can we add a Cargo Carousel System inside a Cargo Carousel module? And the most important one; ""Does it exemplify Corporate Social Responsibility?” Glen's answer to all of these questions was a resounding ""YES!""</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>We Did Our Research</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446967252/q6ulpfggcz50joivfxzh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To verify this, we conducted market research on competitive analysis, market availability, costs to market and market penetration.</p>
<p>Then we focused on:</p>

<h3>Keep It Independent</h3>
<p>From our research we ascertained the costs involved in bringing this radically new idea to the market. We’re also very aware that if we seek corporate funding the corporation may keep the Cargo Carousel System to themselves, increasing their profits but, not reducing the carbon footprint on all the products you buy. We continued our research and discovered crowdfunding as well as government grants supportive of our project.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>We Joined a Revolution</h3>
<p>We looked everywhere to see if a similar product was already available (it’s not), applied for a patent and found other people and organizations that were trying to solve the challenges of a <a href=""http://2waysupplychain.com/definitions/#sustainable-supply-chain"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">sustainable supply chain</a> too.</p>
<p>We learned about the <a href=""http://2waysupplychain.com/videos/physical-internet/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Physical Internet</a>, <a href=""http://2waysupplychain.com/videos/circular-economy/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Circular Economy</a>, <a href=""http://2waysupplychain.com/videos/modulushca-project/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Modulushca Project</a>, <a href=""http://metrolab.heinz.cmu.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">MetroLab Network</a> and <a href=""http://2waysupplychain.com/videos/internet-of-things/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">The Internet of Things</a>. We found ourselves right in the middle of a supply chain revolution with smart, influential and concerned people wanting to make the supply chain sustainable. And the Cargo Carousel System fits right in! In fact the Cargo Carousel System will physically connect these great sustainability concepts with all the manufacturers, trucking companies, distributors and retailers as they move, store, track and sell products.</p>
<p>We all agree that the old supply chain system needs to be made sustainable for our environment.  Your contribution will help make it happen.</p>

<h2>Perks Go Green</h2>
<p>Wearable perks are a fun idea but, offering t-shirts or baseball caps we ship to you would only add to greenhouse gas emissions. Since recycling and supporting a sustainable supply chain is what we’re about we decided on ""printables"".</p>
<h3>Large printable</h3>
<p>We’ll email our trademarked logo to you as a printable. You print it onto transfer paper and iron it onto a t-shirt, hoodie, etc of your choice. Recycle a plain t-shirt into a ""Sustainable Supply Chain"" t-shirt.</p>
<h3>Small printable</h3>
<p>We’ll also email a smaller printable to slip into a campaign button/pin.</p>

<h3>Our Personal Investment</h3>
<p>Through the journey, our idea has received a lot of support. It’s what the industry needs now and we’re the first ones with this new technology. <b>We've already invested 3 years of full-time research and over $115,000 of our own dollars because we believe the benefits to the industry, and especially for our environment, are worth the risks.</b></p>
<p>We’re at the point where a prototype is needed to move the project from conception to reality and radically improve the way retailers get products to you.</p>
<p>Make a difference.  Contribute and help dramatically reduce the harm the huge supply chain industry causes to our environment.</p>
<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
<p>This may seem like a lot of money for one prototype but, most inventors lose their shirts or their invention to a better funded source (i.e. corporations) because they didn’t do their due diligence and find out all the costs involved in getting a new technology to market.  Costs, such as patent filing for well over a hundred countries around the world can add up quickly.</p>

<h3>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h3>
<p>There is always the risk that this campaign may not reach its goal but, we have a plan of action to ensure we can build a prototype through individual and government funding. However your contribution will help insure the Cargo Carousel System is made available to the entire supply chain sooner so all the products you buy have a smaller carbon footprint.</p>

The Cargo Carousel for Greener, Cheaper, Faster and Safer Shipping
Every product at your favorite retailers is shipped there through the supply chain. Your financial support will help build a new invention that will cut the pollution caused by trucks in the supply chain by as much as half and replace all the wooden pallets product sit on during transit with recycled aluminum modules, cutting deforestation by as much as 50%.
Your contribution will go towards building a Cargo Carousel System prototype so the supply chain industry can see first hand how this new invention will dramatically help the environment, reduce costs and streamline shipping processes.
Without your help we may need to seek corporate funding  and the corporation could keep the Cargo Carousel System to themselves, increasing their profits but, not reducing the carbon footprint for the entire supply chain and all the products you buy. The next step is yours... Make a contribution today and share on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google plus and by email because it's good for our environment. 
Greener, Cheaper, Faster and Safer
See below how your contribution will help make the supply chain greener, cheaper, faster and safer so the products we all buy have a smaller carbon footprint.
Greener: Reduce Deforestation by as much as 50%
The production of wooden pallets alone consumes as much hardwood in the US, every year, as all other uses combined.  Yes, every year up to half of all the trees cut down are used to make pallets!  Your contribution will help build a prototype to show the supply chain industry how they can eliminate the need for wooden pallets and still save money bringing products to your favorite retailer.


 
Cheaper: Ride Sharing for Products 
Eliminating partially filled trucks has proven to save 35% in shipping costs and reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions even further.
We've replaced pallets with opaque, closed, lockable and sealable modules. These secure modules allow different shippers to share the same truck without worrying about competitors prying eyes, encouraging collaborative or consolidated transport for smaller shipments in both the supply and reverse chains. 


Faster: Giant Vending Machine 

Adding small Cargo Carousels inside full scale Cargo Carousel modules with a digital keypad for access creates automated customer pick-up, like a giant vending machine anywhere the Cargo Carousel is positioned such as in a parking lot or even facing “inside” a store, high-rise or mall.  Pick up your order when it suits your schedule or to avoid lines.
The Cargo Carousel modules would be pre-stocked with customers orders and swapped out as orders are picked up. These vending machines could be placed throughout the city so customers travel less to retrieve their orders reducing time and greenhouse gas emissions even further.

Safer: Dock Free Warehouses 


 
The Cargo Carousel System could eliminate whole distribution centers in exchange for ground level, weatherproof, temperature-controllable containers in smaller, multiple, secure, fenced yards. With no need for docks, dock plates and dock levelers the new distribution center will be safer for employees to use. Distribution centers would also be smaller and closer to the consumer reducing their impact on the environment.

Greener: Reduce Packaging
Modules in the Cargo Carousel can be built as actual retail display fixtures with merchandise already in the fixture to “swap” out with empty fixtures in the store to minimize handling and reduce waste from excess packaging that would otherwise go into landfills.
Cheaper: Double Storage Capacity 
 

 
Stacking Cargo Carousel containers side-by-side in a warehouse creates automated deep storage and retrieval that offers twice the space utilization of regular racking or shelving as it minimizes the need for all the aisles that are required for forklifts to maneuver. New warehouses will be half as large and existing warehouses will store twice as much further reducing warehousing's costs and environmental impact.
 


Yes, you can make an entire industry transform the wasteful way it brings products to your favorite retailers.  Go green by choosing a perk listed on the right for your contribution!

Glen’s Journey
Glen started his career in the engineering field back in the 70's when design was still done on a drafting table. When CAD (computer assisted design) came about Glen realized that he would have to go back to school either to learn CAD or another career. He chose accounting to improve his position in the ""business"" end of the engineering field and spent six years at night school in his pursuit (Glen understands perseverance).
Fast forward and we find Glen working on the design of a distribution center for a major retailing outfit in eastern Canada. It was here that Glen discovered the inner workings of supply chains and he was amazed at how antiquated and inefficient they were. Empty trucks lined up at the security gate, engines idling, waiting to pick up their loads and even more of them leaving empty after their deliveries. How could this be? Huge retailing operations with warehouses bigger than a million square feet each who are actually shipping more air than merchandise! With all their money and brainpower and this is the best they could do? Unbelievable! There has to be a better way. That's when Glen decided to go into business for himself.
Glen Goes Green

In the early years before eBay, Overstock.com and the like had come into existence, Glen started a company selling distressed inventory from his own 46,000 square foot warehouse. Distressed inventory are products that haven’t been sold in the retail stores and were being sent straight to landfills. He was being green by keeping literally tons of products out of landfills.
It was during this time that he learned the ropes of the supply and reverse chains and figured out a smarter way to move merchandise in both the supply and reverse chains at the same time! In 2012 Glen changed his focus and the Cargo Carousel System was born.
 

Carmen Goes Green
Which brings us to Glen’s wife, Carmen Munholland. When Glen explained this concept to her, she had a lot of questions. Such as... ""Is the supply chain really unsustainable? Is it something they can adopt easily? Does it make their job easier? Is it cost effective?  Can we add a Cargo Carousel System inside a Cargo Carousel module? And the most important one; ""Does it exemplify Corporate Social Responsibility?” Glen's answer to all of these questions was a resounding ""YES!""
 
We Did Our Research

To verify this, we conducted market research on competitive analysis, market availability, costs to market and market penetration.
Then we focused on:

product definition research and analysis on end user
customer requirements (product life span, functionality strength, rigidity, flexibility, look, feel and performance)
product cost per volume
sales channels
timing requirements
human factors/intuitive interface
expected use
safety
failure mode and effects analysis
warranty
certification
social concerns

and manufacturing (cost, time, material, size, weight, complexity)


Keep It Independent
From our research we ascertained the costs involved in bringing this radically new idea to the market. We’re also very aware that if we seek corporate funding the corporation may keep the Cargo Carousel System to themselves, increasing their profits but, not reducing the carbon footprint on all the products you buy. We continued our research and discovered crowdfunding as well as government grants supportive of our project.

 
We Joined a Revolution
We looked everywhere to see if a similar product was already available (it’s not), applied for a patent and found other people and organizations that were trying to solve the challenges of a sustainable supply chain too.
We learned about the Physical Internet, Circular Economy, Modulushca Project, MetroLab Network and The Internet of Things. We found ourselves right in the middle of a supply chain revolution with smart, influential and concerned people wanting to make the supply chain sustainable. And the Cargo Carousel System fits right in! In fact the Cargo Carousel System will physically connect these great sustainability concepts with all the manufacturers, trucking companies, distributors and retailers as they move, store, track and sell products.
We all agree that the old supply chain system needs to be made sustainable for our environment.  Your contribution will help make it happen.

 
Perks Go Green
Wearable perks are a fun idea but, offering t-shirts or baseball caps we ship to you would only add to greenhouse gas emissions. Since recycling and supporting a sustainable supply chain is what we’re about we decided on ""printables"".
Large printable
We’ll email our trademarked logo to you as a printable. You print it onto transfer paper and iron it onto a t-shirt, hoodie, etc of your choice. Recycle a plain t-shirt into a ""Sustainable Supply Chain"" t-shirt.
Small printable
We’ll also email a smaller printable to slip into a campaign button/pin.




The Numbers...

 
Calculated Risks and Challenges
To manage risk, we conducted an exhaustive study of the industry for the Cargo Carousel System. We’ve also conferred with academia and government and received support and validation for our idea.
Of special note:

Dr. Ben Montreuil author of The Physical Internet and past Chair of the Canadian Inter-university Research Center on Enterprise Logistics and Transportation.



Innovate Calgary, an offshoot of the University of Calgary.
Bill Pawluk, President of Convertible Trailer Manufacturing and a veteran of business development in an industry that is very similar to ours.
Alberta Government support through the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.

 
Our Personal Investment
Through the journey, our idea has received a lot of support. It’s what the industry needs now and we’re the first ones with this new technology. We've already invested 3 years of full-time research and over $115,000 of our own dollars because we believe the benefits to the industry, and especially for our environment, are worth the risks.
We’re at the point where a prototype is needed to move the project from conception to reality and radically improve the way retailers get products to you.
Make a difference.  Contribute and help dramatically reduce the harm the huge supply chain industry causes to our environment.
Use of Funds
This may seem like a lot of money for one prototype but, most inventors lose their shirts or their invention to a better funded source (i.e. corporations) because they didn’t do their due diligence and find out all the costs involved in getting a new technology to market.  Costs, such as patent filing for well over a hundred countries around the world can add up quickly.

The funds raised will go towards:

Grant application fees – SAIT        2500
IRAP Government grant – 1         25000
IRAP Government grant – 2         75000
International patent                      195000
Production engineering               155000
Marketing                                           35000
Admin/Social Media                       55000
Legal                                                     65000
Project management                      50000
ISO container                                       5000
Semi-tractor/trailer lease            42000
Trade show tour                               95000

Total                                                  799500

Less: Grant funding                    (400000)

Balance of funding required 399500


 
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
There is always the risk that this campaign may not reach its goal but, we have a plan of action to ensure we can build a prototype through individual and government funding. However your contribution will help insure the Cargo Carousel System is made available to the entire supply chain sooner so all the products you buy have a smaller carbon footprint.

     mis-managed by the Government and should be returned to the rural populations who have had
     their lands and forests destroyed.
For now the Government is
     being proactive and seeking our partners advice and expertise. They know that the radio shows made this issue a national priority and helped them understand
 what the country was facing.
A positive outcome would 
     greatly benefit many citizens.
The Government is aware of
     how useful the radio programs are to the Task Force Team, however having
     suffered a military coup d’état 3 years ago and just being a newly
     re-instated government the state funds are extremely limited, hence why we
     have been asked to assist.

I had, between November 7 and November 16, 2011, been to the vet with 1 cat that had surgery, 1 cat an exam and 1 cat that had come down with an upper respiratory infection.  On November 16, 2011 after speaking to the vet about preventing this URI from spreading to the other cats she provided me more medication and suggested I order L Lysine for all of the cats which was not in stock.  I ordered it and it came in the day after the raid.  The cats were under a vets care for the URI since the day before the raid, they were being cared for, vetted and  were not emaciated.  As a matter of fact the ACO testified during the trial that I did give him medication for the cats that had an upper respiratory infection and that he chose not to give it to them.  The animal control vet testified that he in fact prescribed medication to replace my vet's medication I provided animal control with.  The vet further testified that the ACO failed to pick up this medication for 4 days, the paperwork shows the first dose of medication given was given the day AFTER the state vet examined the animals, which was 11/21/11.  So the cats that had/were exhibiting signs of an upper respiratory infection went without much needed medication for 5 days and none of the cats received L Lysine at all.  This is according to paperwork from animal control and the testimony during the trial.  Anyone with cats that knows what an URI can do knows that if a cat can't breathe they will not eat, if a cat won't eat they can die if left without necessary treatment.<br/><br/>Pumpkin was a 7 week old kitten that died in her cage (with her siblings)  9 days after she was removed from our care.  We were charged with her death.<br/><br/>Sagwa was a beloved cat belonging to my then 14 year old son Parker.  She had a seizure while in animal controls care, the person in charge of these cats care called the aco and the vet who told her if Sagwa continues to seize for more than 30 minutes to euthanize her.  So Sagwa was murdered, they did not bother to take her to the vet which was 10 minutes away, nor have the vet come examine her.  Chances are if Sagwa had an injection of Valium she'd be alive today.  Sagwa never had any health problems the 7 years we had her.  Sagwa was murdered 11 days after being removed from our care.  We were charged with her death.<br/><br/>Garfield also belonged to Parker.  Garfield was fine in our care, he was alert, he was laying in the window when animal control arrived.  The record states that Garfield,  12 days after being removed from our care,  had labored breathing, blood tinged pus coming from his mouth and instead of taking him to the vet or having the vet come examine him, they euthanized him.  We were charged with his death.<br/><br/>Abbigayle was one of our adoption cats.  27 days after she was removed from our care she died from being starved to death for 8 days.  This is not what what think or assume, this is actual documentation from animal control.  We were charged with her death.<br/><br/>We demanded a jury trial because we are innocent, we did not do this, nor would we ever.  We love animals especially our own.  We knew we could prove our innocence as their evidence against us lays out pretty much how these cats died and who was at fault. However we did not receive a fair trial and were found guilty of child neglect and found guilty on each of the 4 cats for animal neglect, the charges on the cats was failure to provide reasonable care and failure to provide veterinary care.  However, the cats were reasonably cared for in our care and I provided animal control with medication the cats were on, and had been provided veterinary care.<br/><br/>The reasons we feel we did not receive a fair trial.....<br/><br/>1) For nearly 2 years we had the same judge, then 1 week before the trial we got another judge, which oddly enough was the same judge that caused me to file the tort claim to begin with.  Our attorneys filed a Motion to Recuse and she refused to do so twice.    This was a conflict of interest.  Not a small one either. This was not us going in front of this judge for a traffic ticket or something minor.    Her excuse was that she did not remember the case.  Even attorneys that have become judges won't take a case that they were once counsel to as it is a conflict of interest.<br/><br/>2) We do not feel the charges are even valid.  The reasons...1) the aco called in an exigent warrant on my black lab his exact words ""I can see his spine and ribs from a distance"".  However, I fought for my animals and the very same dog;  Coal got sick in their care, the judge (not the superior court judge) ordered the aco to take Coal to my vet, my vet wanted Coal to be seen by a specialist and during this visit with the specialist the ACO  told the vet ""when I received the dog I'd say he was of average weight"".  I have this on audio recording that Parker thought would  be helpful to me for the animals attorney, so we could remember exactly what the vet said was wrong with Coal, his prognoses, etc.   Then during the trial the State Vet testified that Coal was in fact of average weight.   She stated through her examination all 3 dogs were of average weight.   So why were we not charged with Coal's alleged emaciation?  This exigent warrant happened 3 hours before they got a warrant to enter our house.  They charged us on cats that were fine in our care, even took one that had sutures still from a $200 surgery, took one that I provided medication for from my vet that week, but yet we were not charged with a dog that the aco called in an exigent warrant on claiming the dog was skin and bones.<br/><br/>3)For months my attorney said he has asked the prosecutor if there were anymore intake photos as I did not receive them all.  He assured my attorney that all the discovery had been sent to him and my husbands attorney.  This is the same prosecutor that told the judge during a hearing when I told the judge I had not received any intake photos that there were no photos.  The judge asked me why I thought there were intake photos.  I told the judge the prosecutor told me there were 2 disks.  However the prosecutor laughed it off trying to make me look stupid.  The judge told him to look and see if there were any photos.  I did end up later getting 1 disk with some pictures of the cats, no dogs or chickens.  During the trial the prosecutor sprung these extra photos of the cats (still no photos of the dogs or the chickens) that WERE NOT part of the pre trial discover.  Both our attorneys objected to them being entered.  The judge allowed them to be entered because the prosecutor said they were given to me, in which they weren't.<br/><br/> 4) There are no intake photos of Pumpkin and there are no photos of any dead cats to prove these cats actually died.<br/><br/>5) BOTH the vet for animal control AND the State Vet testified in court when asked if they can say I or my husband had anything to do to cause the cats deaths BOTH said no.<br/><br/>6) My vet bills were not allowed to be used as my defense because the prosecutor objected.  When the lawyers spoke with the judge the judge refused to allow them, her reason was ""because the defense attorneys should had entered them into evidence as business documents before the trial.""  <br/><br/>7) The fact that the State Vet examined all the animals on November 21, 2011 and scored ALL the cats under a body condition score of a 4, most of them scoring a 1-2.  This includes the 2 cats I got the evening before the raid.  So if these cats were so underweight why was the person that I feel was the ""set up"" not charged as well? Both her cats scored a 3 and I think a 2.<br/><br/>8) The child neglect charges are based on opinions from the deputy that I made my 14 year old son and 17 year old daughter to sleep in my 19 year old sons bed.  However, my house was a mess because I moved my 19 year old son out of his bedroom which was in the the basement because it had flooded.  Why on earth would I move 1 kid to the living room and make my 2 other children sleep in his bed when they have their own bedrooms?  Not to mention, both the aco and the deputy testified as to where Parker and Candace's bedrooms were.  No one used the basement since the first week of October of that year, we had to empty out a full size basement, it had to go to the main floor and to the loft.  What items could go in the shed went into the shed.  We lost a whole floor that was used as a bedroom and storage, emptying a full size basement with a bunch of wet and dirty items is not something that can be done in a day especially with 3 kids in school, a husband with a full time job and me with a physical disability.  To prevent it being overwhelming we did it on weekends and I and the kids would finish cleaning things and finding a place for them to go during the week.<br/><br/>I will add the rest as I can but you get the idea.<br/><br/>So now, we are coming to the end of appeal phase, and have to take a final appeal to the Supreme Court, after that is our plea for post conviction relief.  We have to raise $23,000 for a private attorney to go forth for post conviction relief.  The sole reason we are doing this is to get justice for our children and our animals.  Our kids have been put through hell because of the system, not because of us.  And our animals were abused while in animal controls care.  State law says you are to vet an animal that is ill, I did that, the ACO did not and testified to that.  If we ever get the conviction overturned and are acquitted  we then can seek justice for all the cats that died in Animal Controls care, that would be Pumpkin, Sagwa, Garfield, Abbigayle, Izzie and Kitler as well as Parkers rooster Zim.  We need to get justice for the abuse and neglect these animals suffered while we fought 2 years to get them home. <br/><br/>If you have further questions please ask me or look at our website.  I know some of you will see the truth and will become furious as to what happened.  While others will be oblivious to the truth and support a corrupt system and that is your choice.  However, we are innocent and are simply asking to have the ENTIRE truth be told in an honest court of law, by competent representation.  To achieve that we need help.  We have to raise $23,000 to hire a private attorney, we cannot afford to put our lives in the hands of another public defender for this last leg of hope.  Our first hurdle is raising $3000 in a short time frame.  This is a must to get these parties going on this, we don't have very long.<br/><br/>We are having auctions and selling what we can to raise this money, but if you can donate just $1 to see our kids and cats get justice we appreciate it.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Samantha, Randell, Joshua, Candace and Parker<br/>We all are animal lovers, we are against animal abuse and we want justice and the right person charged with the mental abuse  placed upon our children and the physical abuse and neglect our animals endured.<p></p></div>","Our cats were murdered by our local animal control officer, we believe out of retaliation because I filed a tort claim against him.  We run a no kill cat shelter and have some unethical figures of authority in our county that feel they can bully people and you are not allowed to stand up to them.  I am not the type of person to allow my civil rights to be trampled on.  This is a very, very long story, but this is the jest of it.........My husband and I were charged for the deaths of Pumpkin, Sagwa, Garfield and Abbigayle.  Our rescue was raided on November 17, 2011.   We did not cause these cats to die.  The cats were fine in our care.

Through this conservation work we will also establish research that will help us better understand the shark species in those waters.
Our project objectives would be:  Establish a finalized protection plan for nurseries used by sharks in the Dominican Republic. Create a shark monitoring program with the locals in the areas to compile and keep data. Document shark behavior through film and photo for conservation purposes.
Have ongoing local and international presentations about our work, our procedures and how this project is helping the locals and their economy.

   What We Need & What You Get Since we are a nonprofit, everything comes out of our own pockets and sometimes we simply cannot afford all of the costs. What the money would be used for:  100% of the funding is to cover our research, meetings, awareness and education programs, and transportation to monitor the areas we are establishing as protected regions. If you help fund this project you will be one in a group of a few people who can have access to our research and work before the general public does.    The Impact There is currently no proper monitoring program in the Dominican Republic and specifically none for the nurseries that are being used by sharks, and as a result the sharks are being fished out of the waters faster than they can reproduce. This is where this project comes in:  Sharks are migratory species, so we need to do all that we can to better protect them and establishing a proper nursery protection and monitoring program is the first step. A lot of the sharks we will be working with use most of the areas we are monitoring as nurseries - so, these areas are vital to healthy and stable shark populations hence why they need to be monitored. We all need healthy shark populations in order to have healthy oceans and this project takes a very active approach to help maintain that.

there is urgent need for research that seek to understand indigenous conservation
philosophies and explore ways to integrate these philosophies with modern
conservation strategies. A historical perspective of the Tsavo landscape will
shed light on current conflicts of over access to and control of scarce natural resources
and inform new management action. The main
objective of my research in Tsavo is to explore an alternative management
approach that empowers local people to be the first protectors of elephants. There
is need to resurrect a sense of ownership of wildlife resources among communities
resident in Tsavo. This ground breaking research intends
to design programs that will correct the erroneous perception that government
officials own wildlife resources including elephants. These programs will
re-instill a sense of ownership of wildlife resources among local people in
Tsavo and create a better environment for collaboration between government
officials and residents. Ultimately, this research will develop a new tool for
environmental conservation in Tsavo that can be adopted as a model in other African

Introduction


My name is Peter Kamau. I am a PhD candidate in the
Department of Geography and Anthropology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I
conduct research on human-environment interactions in Africa. My current
research focus is on how local knowledge can be integrated with scientific
knowledge to solve environmental problems in Africa. Specifically, I am very passionate about the conservation of
the African elephant. 




My research area
In Africa, modern conservation approaches that disregard
indigenous conservation practices and exclude local communities in conservation
planning have proved very ineffective. 
With growing human numbers across Africa, keeping poor people away from
protected areas have become too costly and confrontational.
In Tsavo, Kenya, conflicts between residents and
conservation authorities over access to protected area resources are intense. Human activities especially livestock grazing in Tsavo have put pressure on wildlife habitat and also created an
environment for illegal killing of elephants for ivory. Poaching of elephants
for ivory persists in Tsavo despite enormous efforts by conservation
authorities.



Map of Tsavo region
My research objective


In order to ensure the survival of elephants in Tsavo,
there is urgent need for research that seek to understand indigenous conservation
philosophies and explore ways to integrate these philosophies with modern
conservation strategies. A historical perspective of the Tsavo landscape will
shed light on current conflicts of over access to and control of scarce natural resources
and inform new management action. The main
objective of my research in Tsavo is to explore an alternative management
approach that empowers local people to be the first protectors of elephants. There
is need to resurrect a sense of ownership of wildlife resources among communities
resident in Tsavo. This ground breaking research intends
to design programs that will correct the erroneous perception that government
officials own wildlife resources including elephants. These programs will
re-instill a sense of ownership of wildlife resources among local people in
Tsavo and create a better environment for collaboration between government
officials and residents. Ultimately, this research will develop a new tool for
environmental conservation in Tsavo that can be adopted as a model in other African
countries.  


  Research Impact

This campaign seeks to raise funds to promote the
conservation of elephants in Tsavo through field research. My main conviction
in this campaign is that local people's knowledge is critical in protecting elephants and their habitats. Success in protecting elephants in Tsavo depends
on the goodwill of local people. Research has shown that conservation
approaches that create hostility between local people and authorities are
counterproductive. There must be deliberate effort to ensure that local people
support conservation efforts.
I intend to conduct participatory research in Tsavo
over a one month period between December 15th 2015 and January 10th
2016. This will be a continuation of research conducted in Tsavo in the summer
of 2015. I will do oral interviews with key informants, hold focus group discussions with existing village groups to gain local perspectives on elephant conservation. My research will also include participant observation and transect walks across villages adjacent to Tsavo parks. 
Funds donated in this campaign will facilitate my travel
to Tsavo, Kenya in December 2015 and also cater for my accommodation and food expenses
while in Tsavo. The estimated cost of a return air ticket to Kenya is $ 1500. I will
be in Tsavo for 25 days at an estimated cost of $ 20 per day in food and accommodation. I will need $ 500 to compensate my research participants for their time.
Am kindly requesting to be supported with $ 2500 to facilitate my research in December this year. Thank you very much for your generous support.

Los Niños educados en el respeto por la vida, conscientes y actores en contra del cambio climático son conscientes de la contaminación ambiental a lo largo de su vida, gracias a tu ayuda, más niños podrán acceder a todos los beneficios que ofrece la preparación, creación y los productos de un Biohuerto en su escuelaCon tu ayuda podremos Instituciones Educativas Frente al Cambio Climático a 5 colegio más en Lima 



• Create more Peruvian Schools Against Climate Change 
• Educate more children on respect for life and acting against
climate change
• Implement more BioGardens in Peruvian Schools with appropriate staff
training 
• Acquire more seeds, organic fertilizers and tools for the development
of BioGardens
• Increase the number of schools within the project.


Goal / Meta

We need to raise at least 17 000 US$ to expand Schools
Against Climate Change to the next 5 schools in Lima. The more money we
raise, The more schools would have BioGardens and the more children would benefit.
Necesitamos llegar a 17,000 US$ para expandir Instituciones Educativas Activas Frente al Cambio Climático a los siguientes 5 colegios. Cuanto más recaudemos, más escuelas tendrán un BioHuerto y más niños se verán beneficiados.

This campaign is an effort to mobilize 3 Partners of the California based Whole Com Team to develop multiple commercial solar projects in the Southeastern United States. 
This campaign gets you involved INSIDE of Whole Com and shows you HOW to MAKE A DIFFERENCE, SIMPLY AND EASILY. The more people invest, the more 'sustainable' solar power is deployed.


Whole Com is offering you the opportunity to invest in the solar panels on our next commercial project!  You can invest a small amount per solar panel and help produce more clean energy without having to buy a whole system or start a solar development company yourself! 






Perhaps you have an apartment and cannot get solar for your home. Maybe you are already powering your home with solar energy but want to make a bigger impact on the growth of the industry by partnering with us!   Yes, YOU can invest in Whole Com and help produce more clean energy! 


This is your opportunity to invest in our company and take ownership in a commercial Solar Project. Besides the satisfaction of contributing to the healing of the earth you could get a return from your investment over the next 5 years! 

ABOUT WHOLE COM 


Whole Com was founded 15 months ago by entrepreneur and transformational thought leader, Corey Call. The success of his RENEW FI conference has developed many innovative financing abilities and created an advanced network with large scale solutions. Corey has aligned himself with mentors and Solar leaders like Danny Kennedy, Mark Grobmyer,  Doug Carter and Pablo Otin.  
Currently, Corey is traveling on a “Solar Tour” through Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina, with long term partner and co-founder Daniel Jimenez and new business development team member, Joel Atchison.
We are continuing to expand from already popular residential solar markets to developing commercial solar projects which can start chiseling away at the energy crisis at a much faster rate. Recently the Pope said, ""We need a Revolution of Hearts and Minds of the Human Race"" to face the Climate issues at hand. 
Whole Com has worked hard to gather an effective system and team, and now we have the opportunity to share it with the world! Whole Com gives you the access and ability to become part of the bigger picture. 



HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED




The funds raised through this campaign will underwrite the basic needs of the Whole Com Team as they travel in a circuit around Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina working on multiple Commercial Solar projects already in motion.  The more our campaign raises, the more work we can get done to get the solar ball rolling in the southeast!

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our oceans</strong> are facing a catastrophic biodiversity decline. Coastal communities often lack incentives to protect marine animals and continue to kill even endangered species. Ocean Eye is an innovative technology solution that provides a financial benefit to coastal communities which is linked to the <strong><i>long-term recovery of marine animal populations</i></strong> through an application that facilitates small tourism payments for each animal sighted during a trip.</p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>We are Sari, Mareike, Simon and Paul, a team of ocean lovers, conservation experts and a tech developer. We have been working in the global marine conservation arena for decades and have developed ocean eye to meet the key conservation challenge we often face -- stakeholder buy in. </p>
<p>With Ocean Eye we can finally start giving rewards from marine tourism directly to the people who most depend on the hunting and killing of these animals, the coastal communities. This technology allows secure and transparent payment that is for the first time linked to species recovery, creating a powerful incentive for behavior change and conservation.</p>
<p>We already raised over 6000 USD in our campaign in June, which has allowed us to incorporate Ocean Eye into a legal entity, to develop our business plan, develop a prototype app as well as identify first pilot sites for testing the prototype and began field operations.</p>
<p>We now need funds to develop the full minimum viable product. Given the complexity of the features  and high level of security required this is estimated to cost another 25 000 USD.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>-We need  25 000 USD towards the development of  the minimum viable product and <strong>to properly launch Ocean Eye</strong>.</p>
<p>-For individuals donations of 500 USD or over you will get your name on our website and for companies with donations of 1000 USD or over you will get your logo as a sponsor on our website.</p>
<p>-Donations of 100 USD or over will get a digital marine life photograph and a personal thank you note. </p>
<p>-After the application is ready we can start implementing in the field and we will send all donors over 50 USD success stories of marine life numbers and community benefits one year after the application is launched so you can stay tuned and really see what wonderful impact your donation had. </p>
<p>-For donation of 10 USD and over you will get personalised thank you note.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We and our many colleagues working in the biodiversity and marine conservation sectors believe this innovation is a game changing idea, especially in the developing country context where coastal communities lack incentives to protect marine life. Science has demonstrated that number one factor in successful marine protected areas is stakeholder buy in. This is what Ocean Eye is working at. It will enable a direct and transparent payment from tourists to the community and provide them an incentive to protect sharks, turtles, manta rays, dolphins and many other marine animals instead of killing them for short term cash. </p>
<p>As an example, shark fin is priced at 600 USD a kilo, a real example of shark sightings at a dive operation in Papua, Indonesia showed that if one shark sighting by divers was priced at 50cents, the local community would have received 4653 USD over one year as direct payment. Creating a real financial incentive to control shark fishing in the community. </p>
<p>It will also empower the tourists and the marine recreation sector to be part of the solution and provide a tangible benefit to the communities in the area they visit. In addition this app can provide much needed citizen's science that can further improve the conservation of these species.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We are engaging an experienced tech company that has worked with community interphases to do our app to ensure it will work well in various community and tourism situations and provide flexible enough functions to tailor the species and prices i.e. high end tourists vs budget destinations and to be able to adjust the species according to local issues and biodiversity. </p>
<p>The app has big potential to scale as it does not need ongoing NGO support or funding. The tourism sector can adopt it themselves to use in their areas to help achieve conservation outcomes.</p>
<p>There is always a risk involved when working with communities in conservation and we are consulting broadly with groups and experts in marine conservation and community work that will help us establish guidelines and best practices to ensure the best long-term environmental and social impacts and to mitigate unwanted consequences.</p>

The Impact
We and our many colleagues working in the biodiversity and marine conservation sectors believe this innovation is a game changing idea, especially in the developing country context where coastal communities lack incentives to protect marine life. Science has demonstrated that number one factor in successful marine protected areas is stakeholder buy in. This is what Ocean Eye is working at. It will enable a direct and transparent payment from tourists to the community and provide them an incentive to protect sharks, turtles, manta rays, dolphins and many other marine animals instead of killing them for short term cash. 
As an example, shark fin is priced at 600 USD a kilo, a real example of shark sightings at a dive operation in Papua, Indonesia showed that if one shark sighting by divers was priced at 50cents, the local community would have received 4653 USD over one year as direct payment. Creating a real financial incentive to control shark fishing in the community. 
It will also empower the tourists and the marine recreation sector to be part of the solution and provide a tangible benefit to the communities in the area they visit. In addition this app can provide much needed citizen's science that can further improve the conservation of these species.

Risks & Challenges
We are engaging an experienced tech company that has worked with community interphases to do our app to ensure it will work well in various community and tourism situations and provide flexible enough functions to tailor the species and prices i.e. high end tourists vs budget destinations and to be able to adjust the species according to local issues and biodiversity. 
The app has big potential to scale as it does not need ongoing NGO support or funding. The tourism sector can adopt it themselves to use in their areas to help achieve conservation outcomes.
There is always a risk involved when working with communities in conservation and we are consulting broadly with groups and experts in marine conservation and community work that will help us establish guidelines and best practices to ensure the best long-term environmental and social impacts and to mitigate unwanted consequences.

</div></div>","Un milagro para Los Milagros 
Somos Isabel (Peruana) y Jose Enrique (Español), un matrimonio de fotógrafos y docentes universitarios concienciados con el cuidado del medio ambiente y la importancia de la conservación. Hemos adquirido un fundo de 15 hectáreas en la selva de Aucayacu, en el Caserío Los Milagros, Valle del Alto Huallaga (en la Cuenca Amazónica del Perú), al cual nos queremos dedicar a tiempo completo. 
Nuestro proyecto de vida aquí tiene tres ejes:



Reforestación.


Agricultura sostenible.


Ecoturismo. 


Queremos recuperar el bosque, los suelos, tener cultivos sostenibles, como cacao y café, y realizar actividades ecoturísticas. Esta es una tierra que ha estado abandonada por 10 años (tras muchos años de ser usada para monocultivo de coca), localizada en una comunidad de campesinos que intentan dejar atrás la pobreza mediante cultivos alternativos, sin recurrir nuevamente al cultivo de coca. Contamos con la asesoría de profesionales de la Universidad Agraria de la Selva (UNAS), y estamos empezando desde ya con este proyecto. 
Esta campaña busca fondos para poder empezar a hacer lo más necesario y culminar las primeras etapas lo antes posible, y a largo plazo conseguir el estatus legal de Área de Conservación Privada.
El siguiente video muestra las diferentes secciones del terreno, desde las partes mejor conservadas del bosque hasta la zona agrícola donde plantaremos guaba, cacao y café. 


A miracle for Los Milagros

We are Isabel (Peruvian) and Jose Enrique (Spanish), a marriage of photographers and college professors who care deeply for the environment and for conservation.  We have legally acquired 15 hectares of land in Aucayacu, in Los Milagros, a settlement located in the Alto Huallaga Valley in the Peruvian Amazon basin. 
Our current dream and main project here covers three areas:


Reforestation.
Sustainable agriculture.
Ecotourism. 

 We want to recover the degraded rainforest and its soil, as well as develop sustainable crops, such as cocoa and coffee beans, and starting ecotourism activities. This land has been abandoned for some 10 years, after many years of coca leaf production. Los Milagros (the name means ""Miracles"") is a poor peasant community aiming to progress and leave poverty behind without growing coca again. We are being advised by professionals from the Universidad Agraria de la Selva (National Agrarian University of the Jungle) and have already started to work. 

This fundraising campaign aims to have enough funds to just to start working in the land and making our first stage goals happen as soon as possible, and in the long term to support our land's change in legal status to Private Conservation Area. 
Our home video shows the different zones of our land, since the most well-preserved forest until the agricultural area where we will grow guaba, cocoa and coffee (see below).

I fell in love with the culture and the people. I spent a lot of time exploring different historical sites as well as working at the Pumpkin House Orphanage while I was there.This experience truly opened my eyes and changed the way I thought about the world. The amount of poverty and plastic waste really impacted me during my stay. I met Rafic Korban as I began to think about potential solutions. This is when we began molding an idea that would bring about a social impact by providing people with a steady income, giving them an opportunity to have a safe and sustainable home while cleaning up the environment all at the same time.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rafic Korban: </strong>I grew up in Hong Kong, the most densely populated city in East Asia. I noticed a great deal of trash, which has become a growing problem in and around the city. I recently met my business partner, Nick Kellicker, at Suffolk University.

</ul><p>The more people we show the true value of plastic the quicker society can become less plastic dependent and help save our planet.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Our Mission:As noted above, there is an excess of plastic that is not being recycled. Our goal is to help reduce poverty and clean up our planet by paying the locals that live on less than two dollars a day to collect plastic.   Plastic Pollution & PovertySince 1950, human beings have created over 8.3 billion metric tons/tonnes of plastic and only 9% of that plastic has been recycled. The remaining 7.47 million metrics tons/tonnes of plastic have either been incinerated or are accumulating in landfills, which will eventually end up in our waterways and oceans. It is estimated that ocean plastic causes $13 billion a year in damages and lost revenue. This has and will continue to affect tourism, shipping, and fishing.Why HaitiNatural Disasters (2002-Current)Haiti is located in one of the world's toughest geographical regions. Recently 6 major floods, 17 major hurricanes/tropical storms/torrential rain, as well as 2 earthquakes have devastated the island. Haiti is constantly hit with horrific natural disasters that result in worse conditions than it previously was in. This is partially why Haiti has an 80% poverty rate, which leaves two out of every three people jobless. Pilate Haiti:My business partner and I have formed a strategic relationship with Suze Francois, a local from Pilate, Haiti. Suze will provide us with the necessary local connections that are crucial to success within the region. Our mission is to provide the locals with jobs and to build our first set of homes in Pilate. We will then spread to other towns, which will create additional jobs and increase our social impact. Our SolutionHappy Homes plans to help impoverished Haitians' by providing a consistent, earnable wage and sustainable and affordable housing made out of plastic. Our Brick:The center of our block will be composed of Vetiver, which is a root that is commonly grown in Haiti. These roots are very cheap, abundantly available, and have historically been used as building material in Haiti. The integration of the root will reduce the cost and weight of our bricks. The dimensions of our bricks are 10''L X 6''W X14""H and weigh just over 16lbs. This is nearly one-third the weight of a typical brick this size.About Us:Nick Kellicker: When I was a sophomore in college I spent my winter break in India. I fell in love with the culture and the people. I spent a lot of time exploring different historical sites as well as working at the Pumpkin House Orphanage while I was there.This experience truly opened my eyes and changed the way I thought about the world. The amount of poverty and plastic waste really impacted me during my stay. I met Rafic Korban as I began to think about potential solutions. This is when we began molding an idea that would bring about a social impact by providing people with a steady income, giving them an opportunity to have a safe and sustainable home while cleaning up the environment all at the same time. Rafic Korban: I grew up in Hong Kong, the most densely populated city in East Asia. I noticed a great deal of trash, which has become a growing problem in and around the city. I recently met my business partner, Nick Kellicker, at Suffolk University. We quickly realized that we shared a common interest in helping out impoverished countries dealing with trash problems, specifically plastic. Happy Homes is my solution to help people in need while cleaning up our environment. I am extremely dedicated to making a difference and finding more people who share the same passion as Nick and me.What We Need The ImpactMany people take having a home for granted and don't realize how important it is to have a healthy and happy environment to live in. By providing people with the opportunity to live in an affordable home, we are allowing them to flourish and survive. Along with providing safe, affordable and sustainable homes made out of recycled plastic, Happy Homes is dedicated to providing the Haitian locals with a consistent wage.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of sustainable food systems Masters students, Stephanie Benoit, Clara Ramin, and McKayla Baker, and our professor, Olivia Sylvester, all passionate farmers. We recently learned that Costa Rica uses more harmful pesticides per capita than any other country in the world. So, to offer healthy food options to students and rural community members, we created an small organic farm to grow our own pesticide-free food and to teach community children learn about nature, safe farming practices, and healthy food. Everything we do on this farm is volunteer work and we need your help. Your support will allow us to hire a community member to maintain our farm during summer months when no students are on campus and help it reach its full potential.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are fundraising for $5,000 to pay for one part-time community member to maintain our farm while students are not on campus for two consecutive summers and two December breaks. This works out to 5 months per year (June, July, August, September and December) starting in December 2018. Having a part-time staff member means we can: 1) maintain soil nourished, 2) weed and clear out the many wild species that take over our garden if we are not careful, 3) keep a year round harvest which means a year round farmer’s market for university staff and community members, 4) host and receive children and refugees as volunteers in our garden during the summer and December break (this is also when children are on school holidays and gardening can be something they can do here as a family activity). If we do not reach our entire goal, we will hire a community member for less time (e.g., if we raise 3000 USD, we can hire them for 6 months instead of 10). </p>
<p>Your donations will allow us to hire a part-time staff member for all their hard work maintaining this farm. If your donation is 5 USD or more, we will include your name and country on a mural to be displayed on our farm! If your donation is 50 USD or more, we will send you a UPEACE organic farm T-shirt (optional)!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In less than 2 years, we have created a successful organic farm that has been used as a classroom for over 200 Master’s students from over 20 countries. We have hosted 3 workshops with community school children, one workshop is now part of the local school’s curriculum. We have hosted Indigenous farmer’s from Costa Rica to share their traditional food and medicine knowledge with community youth. Our farm not only produces food but it is a growing site for intergenerational and cross-cultural knowledge sharing about sustainability and peace. All of our work has been done using small donations like yours as well as dedication from student and community volunteers.</p>
<p>By hiring of a staff member during the months that we have no volunteers, we can help ensure that the garden is ready for when students start their school year - and we can make sure this space is being used by our local community all year round. </p>
<p>The University for Peace has provided us the land and access to water to farm, we have a strong network of excited community members and Master's student who want to learn to garden, our sales from farmers markets provide income to buy organic inputs (e.g., charcoal, seeds) - all we need is a little help running our farm when our student volunteers are not on campus!</p>

Istovremeno, izgradnjom ovakvih kuća podrazumijeva se i angažman lokalnih tvrtki i stručnjaka odnosno potiče gospodarska aktivnost. U RH je izgradnja ekoloških kuća u začecima. Izgrađeno je tek nekoliko objekata i uglavnom je riječ o entuzijastima koji su se upustili u njihovu izgradnju.Projekt e+HH provodi se kroz 3 faze:
faza: Izgradnja ekološke kuće od drveta i slame e+HH
faza: Izgradnja permakulturnog vrta
faza: Održivost projekta, koja se provodi na način ispitivanja prednosti stanovanja u kući e+HH, pružanju informacija o izgradnji i stanovanju u kući e+HH, te uzgoj hrane u permakulturnom vrtu i stvaranje održivog načina života
Izgradnja ekološke kuće e+HH
Ovim projektom žele se:

smanjiti operativni troškovi stanovanja, troškove energenata, te troškove održavanja

poboljšati kvaliteta stanovanja uslijed poboljšane kvalitete zraka u zatvorenim prostorima i održavanja ugodne temperature kako ljeti tako i zimi

smanjiti štetni utjecaj na okoliš upotrebom prirodnih građevinskih materijala, čime je emisija CO2 za njihovu proizvodnju svedena na minimum ili je uopće nema
potaknuti korištenje obnovljivih izvora energije
stvoriti preduvjeti održivog načina života uzgojem hrane u permakulturnom vrtu.
Zainteresiranost za gradnju ekološki održive kuće postoji, no zbog nepoznavanja ovakvog načina izgradnje Projekt e+HH pun je izazova. Predstavlja jedan od pionirskih zahvata na našem području. Uspjeli smo projektirati osim drvene konstrukcije i vanjskih zidova izgrađenih od bala slame i ostale dijelove kuće od ekološki prihvatljivih materijala, kao što su obloge unutrašnjih zidova, pregrade te strop. Realizacijom ovog projekta nastojimo potaknuti ekološku izgradnju i održivost, te osviješteni način života koji se dalje proteže na ekološki uzgoj hrane u permakulturnom vrtu.Dvije godine tražili smo adekvatnu lokaciju za projekt e+HH, koja će zadovoljiti ne samo prirodno okruženje, već i adekvatnu veličinu parcele za gradnju permakulturnog vrta.Sinergijom Udruge Studio 8, koja daje svoju tehničku podršku, tvrtke Studio 8 d.o.o., koja ulaže rad i odriče se svoje zarade, te privatnog investitora zatvorena je financijska konstrukcija I. faze projekta. Privatni investitor, član Udruge Studio 8, prodao je svoju ekskluzivnu obiteljsku kuću i novac uložio u kupnju zemljišta, ishođenje projektne dokumentacije, podmirenje komunalnih davanja, te podmirenje jednog dijela troškova izgradnje objekta. Međutim, tijekom izgradnje objekta, zbog upotrebe fungicida koji su namijenjeni za zaštitu drveta, došlo je do požara, koji je uništio do temelja sve do tada izgrađeno. Unatoč financijskom gubitku ne odustajemo od projekta izgradnje ekološke kuće e+HH, već nas je ovaj izazov samo učvrstio u našoj težnji promicanja izgradnje eko održivih objekata. Svoja iskustva želimo podijeliti s drugim korisnicima koji također žele izgraditi ekološku kuću od drveta i slame. Sredstva iz akcije Indiegogo namijenjena su završetku I. faze projekta, a prije svega namirenju gubitka prouzrokovanog požarom.Osim promicanja izgradnje ekoloških kuća i zaštite okoliša dodatne koristi Udruge Studio 8 i tvrtke Studio 8 su:

provedba izrade informacije o energetskoj učinkovitosti i uštedi energije - očekuje se smanjenje troškova energenata, te smanjenje troškova održavanja objekta

provedba izrade komparacije troškova izgradnje ekološkog objekta u odnosu na  konvencionalno izgrađen objekt.
U petogodišnjem proučavanju izgradnje kuće od slame vjerovali smo da postoji tržište i zainteresiranost za ovakvu izgradnju. Što nam je i potvrđeno, te je samo u kratkom razdoblju tromjesečne izgradnje, bez ikakvih dodatnih ulaganja u propagandu, bilo je više zainteresiranih ozbiljnih, potencijalnih investitora. English versionPromotion of eco-friendly house e+HH and creating the preconditions for sustainable lifestyleProject e+HHFACEBOOK  |  WEB  |  BLOG Throug the realization of the project „Promoting the construction of eco-friendly houses e+HH and creating the preconditions for a sustainable lifestyle"" (short name: Project e+HH), Association Studio 8  strive to encourage the construction of ecological wood and straw houses with multiple ecological contributions. At the same time, the construction of such houses also implies the engagement of local companies and experts and promotes economic activity. In the Republic of Croatia the construction of eco-friendly houses is at the beginning. Only a few eco-friendly houses were built by enthusiasts who had started to build them.The Project e+HH is implemented through 3 phases:
Phase: Contruction of eco-friendly house of wood and straw e+HH
Phase: Construction of a permaculture garden
Phase: Sustainability of the Project e+HH, which is carried out as a way of examining the benefits of housing in eco-friendly house e+HH, providing information of construction and housing in eco-friendly house e+HH, and cultivating food in a permaculture garden and creating a sustainable lifestyle
Construction of eco-friendly house e+HH With this project we want:
to reduce operational cost of housing, energy costs and maintenance costs
 to improve the quality of living due to improved indoor air quality and maintaining a comfortable temperature both in summer and winter
to  reduce negative environmental impact by using of natural materials in order to reduce CO2 emissions
to use of renewable energy sources
to create the prerequisites for a sustainable way of life by cultivating food in a permaculture garden.
There is an interest in building an environmentally sustainable house, but due to the lack of awareness of this type of construction, the Project e+HH is full of challenges. It represents one of pioneering projects in our area. We have been able to design apart from the wooden structure and the exterior walls made of block straw, designing other parts of the house from ecologicaly acceptable materials such as lining of interior walls, partitions and ceilings. By implementing this project, we strive to promote ecological construction and sustainability and a conscious way of life that further extends to ecological food cultivation in a permaculture garden.For the last two years we have been looking for an adequate location for the Project e+HH, which would satisty not only the natural environment but also the adequate size of the plot for the construction of a permaculture garden.Synergies of Associations Studio 8, which provides its techical support to company Studio 8 d.o.o., which invest and renounces its profits, and the private investor closed the financial construction of the first phase of Project e+HH.The private investor, a member of Associations Studio 8, sold his exclusive family house and invested money in land purchase, obtaining project documentation, settling public utility charges, and settling part of the cost of building an object. However, during the construction of the house, due to the use of fungicide intended for wood protection, there was a fire that destroyed the foundation until then built. Despite the financial loss, we do not give up on the project of building the eco-friendly house e+HH, but this challenge has only strengthened us in our desire to promote the construction of eco-sustainable houses. We want to share our experiences with other users who also want to build an eco-friendly house of wood and straw. The funds from the Indiegogo action are intended for the completion 1st phase of the Project e+HH and, above all, for dealing with the loss caused by the fire.Apart from promoting the construction of eco-friendly house and environmental protection, the additional benefits of Associations Studio 8 and company Studio 8 are:
implementation of information on energy efficiency and energy savings – energy costs are expected to decrease and maintenance costs will be reduced
implemantation of comparison of the cost of building an ecological house in relation to a conventionally constructed house.
In a five year study of straw construction, we belived there was a market and interest in this kind of construction. What has also been confirmed, and only in the short period of three months of contruction, with no additional investment in propaganda, there were more interested serious potential investors.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Our story</h2>
<p>Through education, science and sailing expeditions along the South African Coastline, we’re working to stem the tide of plastic entering the ocean, before it is too late.</p>
<p>We’ll set sail to educate school children and those with an ear to listen to become responsible users of plastic and make informed decisions about how and when they use plastic and the impact it has on our oceans.</p>
<p>Eight million tons of plastic waste ends up in the ocean every year.</p>
<p>Over 700 species of marine life are known to suffer directly from the devastating effects of plastic pollution.</p>
<p>The decisions we make on land concerning plastic usage ultimately end up affecting the health and sustainability of our oceans.</p>
<p>We’ll continue with the awareness programme we started in 2017. During 2018 we intend to set sail along the South African coastline and on the way, pay a visit to our Hope Spots. False Bay has the Cape Peninsula on one side and stretches from Cape Point (the most southern tip of Africa after Cape Agulhas) to the small village of Rooi-Els. Fishing pressure in unprotected parts of False Bay is significant and ocean pollution is as always prevalent in the area. Part of False Bay is reserved as a marine protected area and ‘no-take’ zone, creating a sanctuary for large reef fish, abalone and small sharks within an area of dense kelp forests. Rich in biodiversity, False Bay also supports a vibrant tourism economy with a wealth of cultural history.</p>
<p>We’ll continue our voyage along a stretch of coastline called The Cape Whale Coast (also a Hope Spot) which stretches from Rooi-Els to the picturesque town of Gansbaai. Mountains meet the sea through an intricate patchwork of estuaries, beaches and bays. Offshore, the temperate south coast currents meet cold west coast swells. These nutrient-rich waters host the African Penguin, Great White Shark, Cape Fur Seal, and three species of whale and dolphin in addition to many endemic bird species. Unfortunately, ocean pollution threatens the very existence of these ecosystems. We need to make people be aware of this – your contribution will bring us one step closer.</p>

Hello, c'est Benjamin et Liga. 
 
On est en train de développer une ferme résiliente sur l'île de Tenerife aux Canaries.
Notre but est de créer une forêt nourricière en plantant 10 000 arbres fruitiers avec les principes de la permaculture.
 
Grâce à votre participation nous allons pouvoir financer une grande diversité d'arbres et marquer ensemble d'une empreinte verte notre passage sur terre.


Vous avez la possibilité de choisir de planter des arbres spécifiques suivant notre petit catalogue et l'option (gratuite) d'avoir une étiquette personnalisée pour l'arbre, qui matérialisera votre geste pour la nature.
Notre catalogue d'arbres




Bananier

Papayer



Manguier

Palmier-Dattier



Avocatier

Kaki





Citronnier



Pomelo Rose



Macadamia




Notre but ultime étant de proposer des retraites à thème en reconnexion avec la nature, nous voulons que ce lieu soit un berceau paradisiaque où l'on transmettra notre passion du vivant. Pour se faire nous adhérons au label ""Green The Desert"" créé par Myriam et Jacky Boisset (voir descriptif plus bas).


 
 

 



 
 


Benjamin en bref :
 
Anciennement ingénieur aéronautique, son objectif est d'être maintenant au contact quotidien avec la terre, de cultiver des produits de qualité et d'échanger de l'énergie positive autour de lui. En créant un lieu éco-responsable où la nature est omniprésente et respectée, elle donnera le plein potentiel d'une forêt nourricière abondante. Pour ce faire, il suit actuellement un cours de conception en permaculture avec un professeur bien connu. Sur le terrain, il sera en charge d'intégrer toutes les connaissances au potager et à la forêt fruitière.




Liga en quelques mots :
 
En mettant de côté les vieilles habitudes culinaires qui étaient ancrées depuis la plus jeune enfance, elle s'est ouverte à une nouvelle passion pour la cuisine végétale vivante crue qui a également suscité un fort intérêt pour la culture du potager. Elle choisit toujours de mettre de la VIE dans l'assiette où les ingrédients proviennent d'un sol riche, vivant, organique et respectueux pour tous les êtres vivants. Elle est naturellement douée d'un grand sens du goût et de la qualité. Elle aime passer du temps en cuisine et à chaque fois c'est comme un voyage différent… comme une oeuvre d'art. Elle aime associer les couleurs, les motifs, l'abondance…
 


 
 


 
Les créateurs du label ""Green the Desert"" :


 
 


Nous sommes deux athlètes professionnels, passionnés de sport, de santé et d’écologie…… et avec le désir de parcourir le monde.

<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<p>The Southern Ocean Carbon Company is building a seaweed farm to combat climate change, and we need your help to get it established. </p>
<p>We are an ambitious start-up company based on the wild and beautiful island of Tasmania, and we are building a kelp farm to confirm what all of the research is suggesting: that seaweed has great potential to capture carbon on a significant scale in order to fight climate change. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607579756/rxyhr8mtur51jefbagpn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Our mission to Save the Planet:</h3>
<p>It is clear that action needs to be taken to combat climate change, and one of the key strategies is to reduce the amount of excess carbon in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>That, in a nutshell, is what we are about: we establish a seaweed farm, grow seaweed that draws carbon from the atmosphere, and then measure and process the carbon we capture – thus reducing carbon emissions and helping in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607579827/psq3tn6doaz01zzkhgtt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>How we are fighting Climate Change:</h3>
<p>The plan is simple: first, we grow spores of temperature tolerant giant kelp on small strings in our hatchery, which are then put onto larger, non-plastic sisal rope and put into the sea at the farm you help us to build. We then let nature take its course - using only sunlight and the nutrients in the ocean and watch it grow, grow, grow!</p>
<p>When the seaweed is fully-grown the magic happens - the critical step to lock in the carbon we have captured.</p>
<p>This will be done through one of three methods: biochar, biofuel or our preferred method: reintroducing our rope directly into the areas where kelp forests once were; giving back to the environment whilst capturing and locking in carbon.</p>
<p>But first we need the means to create/scale our seaweed farm and produce crops year-on-year, and we need your help to make that happen.</p>
<p>We have 5km of rope ready to go in the water, and have earmarked over a thousand hectares of potential lease sites for our seaweed farm, as well as the lease we have currently in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel. We have already put 900m in the water on our trial site, and are seeing incredible growth of endemic algae species. </p>
<p>We have started, but there is work to be done!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>How does Seaweed capture carbon?</h3>
<p>Photosynthesis captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; the captured carbon is stored in the body of the seaweed. Seaweed absorbs a huge amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – research has found that balanced coastal ecosystems can capture up to 20 times more carbon per acre than land forests!</p>
<p>In fact, its calculated that 200 million tons of carbon dioxide is being locked in by seaweed every year!</p>
<p>Unlike carbon sequestration through land forests, there is no risk of fire and land usage is reduced with seaweed farms. Seaweed farms also provide critical habitats for fish species, uptake nutrients from the environment and produce oxygen. Scientists have estimated that marine algae produces anywhere from 50% to 80% of the Earth’s oxygen supply.</p>

<h3>Join the Fight Against Climate Change</h3>
<p>Climate Change is real and happening, the evidence is clear: the planet’s average surface temperature has risen by about 1.14 degrees Celsius in the last 200 years, and most of this warming occurred in the last 40 years. The warming of the ocean has been readily apparent- evidence can be seen in the decrease of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, a loss of 279 billion tons and 148 billion tons (respectively) of ice per year! Where does the ice go? Well sea levels are also on the rise, globally the sea has risen around 20 cm in the last 100 years, but in the last 20 years it has nearly doubled that of the previous years. On top of all this we are seeing the increase of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as heat waves, cyclones, bushfires and flooding.</p>
<p>We still have time to make a difference. To avoid more impacts to our earth we need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030, to do so we need to reduce the amount of excess carbon entering the atmosphere. We have a way to do that!</p>
<p>Currently in Australia, the average carbon footprint for a person in a year is the equivalent of 15.39 tonnes. To beat climate change, we need to limit it to only 2 tonnes.</p>
<p>That is why we want to build this seaweed farm – to reduce the amount of carbon entering the atmosphere, and help in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>We are ready to start but we need the funds to support us in doing that.</p>

Who we are:
The Southern Ocean Carbon Company is building a seaweed farm to combat climate change, and we need your help to get it established. 
We are an ambitious start-up company based on the wild and beautiful island of Tasmania, and we are building a kelp farm to confirm what all of the research is suggesting: that seaweed has great potential to capture carbon on a significant scale in order to fight climate change. 
 

Our mission to Save the Planet:
It is clear that action needs to be taken to combat climate change, and one of the key strategies is to reduce the amount of excess carbon in the atmosphere.
That, in a nutshell, is what we are about: we establish a seaweed farm, grow seaweed that draws carbon from the atmosphere, and then measure and process the carbon we capture – thus reducing carbon emissions and helping in the fight against climate change.
 

How we are fighting Climate Change:
The plan is simple: first, we grow spores of temperature tolerant giant kelp on small strings in our hatchery, which are then put onto larger, non-plastic sisal rope and put into the sea at the farm you help us to build. We then let nature take its course - using only sunlight and the nutrients in the ocean and watch it grow, grow, grow!
When the seaweed is fully-grown the magic happens - the critical step to lock in the carbon we have captured.
This will be done through one of three methods: biochar, biofuel or our preferred method: reintroducing our rope directly into the areas where kelp forests once were; giving back to the environment whilst capturing and locking in carbon.
But first we need the means to create/scale our seaweed farm and produce crops year-on-year, and we need your help to make that happen.
We have 5km of rope ready to go in the water, and have earmarked over a thousand hectares of potential lease sites for our seaweed farm, as well as the lease we have currently in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel. We have already put 900m in the water on our trial site, and are seeing incredible growth of endemic algae species. 
We have started, but there is work to be done!
 

Your Contribution:
A contribution to our Indiegogo campaign will mean that we can start the process of establishing a farm on a decent scale, putting large numbers of anchors, buoys and rope in the ocean to grow the seaweed, which will capture and lock in the carbon.
We estimate that we need $30,000 to get the farm established in a sustainable manner, to purchase the equipment and the infrastructure, as well as pay for the work that has to be done. 
With your contribution, we will begin to place rope in the water - how cool is that? With each dollar you donate, you will directly be placing non-plastic sisal rope into the ocean to grow seaweed. The more money you donate, the more rope we can place in the water; and the more carbon we can capture!
Your contribution will help to get the farm properly established, producing on a scale to get meaningful results.

<li>Determine and track the undiscovered migration patterns and behavior of sharks. If our data proves that threatened sharks travel outside the boundaries of the park and into the dangerous waters of the South China Sea, we can push for international protection against target fisheries, bycatch, and oil and gas exploration.</li>
<li>Figure out why Tubbataha is one of the only places in the Philippines where tiger sharks are seen regularly. These sharks are all juveniles, suggesting that Tubbataha is potentially a rare tiger shark breeding ground.  Our research will help to determine where these sharks come from, and where they are going.</li>

<hr style=""font-weight: bold;""/> <b style=""font-weight: bold;"">FAQ</b><div><ol>
<li>How important is Tubbataha Reef?  <p>As keystone species, sharks maintain a balance in the oceans, and are essential to the health of marine ecosystems and coral reefs.  Tubbataha is rare a shark nursery and represents the last refuge for sharks before a dangerous expanse of ocean where sharks are still regularly hunted for their fins, meat, and oil.  </p>
</li>
<li>Will this expedition help sharks? <br/>Absolutely! Tubbataha is protected, but it represents only a small area in an overfished oceanic desert.  If we can establish why Tubbataha is such a productive location for sharks and where these sharks breed and migrate, we can use this information to push for international protection that can make a huge difference for shark populations worldwide. The data we collect will also help mitigate oil and gas activities that are encroaching on this sensitive region.</li>
<br/>
<li>What makes your team qualified to lead this expedition? <br/>Our team represents the next generation of internationally acclaimed shark scientists, conservation experts, professional journalists, and technology junkies.  We regularly work with international authorities on conservation policy, our work has been featured in top scientific journals, and we have a combined 70 years of experience in the field. Most importantly, we're all full-time shark researchers or conservationists who love what we do and are totally committed to the protection of these animals.</li>
<br/>
<li>What happens if this expedition is not funded?<br/>Without this expedition, we won't have access to information essential for the conservation of this shark eden. Is Tubbataha a tiger shark nursery?  Do sharks migrate from Tubbataha into the unprotected South China Sea? Answers to these questions may mean the difference for the future of sharks and a healthy ocean in Southeast Asia.</li>
<br/>
<li>What happens after the expedition?<br/>Analysis analysis analysis! We will work hard to analyze the data we collect during the expedition so we can push for the targeted protection of important shark habitats in Southeast Asia. We'll also publish any findings and release several films documenting the expedition. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Can I join the expedition?<br/>Yes! Join our expedition crew and help us make history for sharks.  Two spots are available on our research vessel -- see our ""Perks"" section for information on how to to join. If sailing the high seas isn't your cup of tea, you can join the expedition remotely by sponsoring an underwater video system, donating a satellite tag that we'll attach to a whale shark, or making a donation to our campaign and following our regular updates.  Anything helps! <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Are there any terms and conditions associated with the perks?<br/>Yes.

If our data proves that threatened sharks travel outside the boundaries of the park and into the dangerous waters of the South China Sea, we can push for international protection against target fisheries, bycatch, and oil and gas exploration.
Figure out why Tubbataha is one of the only places in the Philippines where tiger sharks are seen regularly. These sharks are all juveniles, suggesting that Tubbataha is potentially a rare tiger shark breeding ground.  Our research will help to determine where these sharks come from, and where they are going.
Learn where whale sharks migrate and reproduce using sophisticated satellite tags.  This information is essential to the survival of these animals, as without a safe and healthy place to breed, they stand little chance at ongoing survival.

  The Explorers




Alessandro Ponzo - Alessandro is the director of the Large Marine Vertebrates Project (LAMAVE). He has worked hard to conserve marine wildlife around the planet for almost 20 years, and is the brains and passion behind the expedition. Dedicated to ocean conservation, his only distraction is finding the best pizza in the world.
Gonzalo Araujo - Gonzalo joined LAMAVE  in July 2012 to help protect the world’s largest fish. His focus is studying the whale shark populations of the Bohol Sea, including their migratory patterns and feeding ecology.  
Jake Levenson - Jake works to design and build mobile apps, marine animal tags and unmanned aerial vehicles for ocean conservation. Armed with an array of tech-gear and an infectious enthusiasm for marine conservation, Jake will be on hand to analyze and calibrate all our equipment, deploy behavioral recording tags and lead acoustic monitoring efforts. 


Marissa Fox - A surfer and corporate lawyer turned dive instructor, Marissa heads up the policy and conservation work for LAMAVE. When she’s not taking photos of fish, Marissa enjoys yoga, all things spicy, and not sitting still. 
Ryan Murray  - An Irish man with saltwater in his blood, Ryan is a LAMAVE marine biologist with a passion for conservation, curry and adventure.  His adventure to Tubbataha will also be yours as he brings you face to face with the sharks and provides an intimate look at the castaway life of the Tubbataha ranger station.

Sally Snow - Zoologist, Filmmaker, Presenter, Blogger – A broadcaster in the UK but a shark researcher in the Philippines, Sally first studied whale sharks with WWF-Philippines before joining LAMAVE in 2012. She has set up and run several projects and is responsible for the production of LAMAVE’s media content. When she's not freediving, she's blogging on SHARK TAILS.

 FAQ
How important is Tubbataha Reef?  As keystone species, sharks maintain a balance in the oceans, and are essential to the health of marine ecosystems and coral reefs.  Tubbataha is rare a shark nursery and represents the last refuge for sharks before a dangerous expanse of ocean where sharks are still regularly hunted for their fins, meat, and oil.  

Will this expedition help sharks? Absolutely! Tubbataha is protected, but it represents only a small area in an overfished oceanic desert.  If we can establish why Tubbataha is such a productive location for sharks and where these sharks breed and migrate, we can use this information to push for international protection that can make a huge difference for shark populations worldwide. The data we collect will also help mitigate oil and gas activities that are encroaching on this sensitive region.

What makes your team qualified to lead this expedition? Our team represents the next generation of internationally acclaimed shark scientists, conservation experts, professional journalists, and technology junkies.  We regularly work with international authorities on conservation policy, our work has been featured in top scientific journals, and we have a combined 70 years of experience in the field. Most importantly, we're all full-time shark researchers or conservationists who love what we do and are totally committed to the protection of these animals.

What happens if this expedition is not funded?Without this expedition, we won't have access to information essential for the conservation of this shark eden. Is Tubbataha a tiger shark nursery?  Do sharks migrate from Tubbataha into the unprotected South China Sea? Answers to these questions may mean the difference for the future of sharks and a healthy ocean in Southeast Asia.

What happens after the expedition?Analysis analysis analysis! We will work hard to analyze the data we collect during the expedition so we can push for the targeted protection of important shark habitats in Southeast Asia. We'll also publish any findings and release several films documenting the expedition. 

Can I join the expedition?Yes! Join our expedition crew and help us make history for sharks.  Two spots are available on our research vessel -- see our ""Perks"" section for information on how to to join. If sailing the high seas isn't your cup of tea, you can join the expedition remotely by sponsoring an underwater video system, donating a satellite tag that we'll attach to a whale shark, or making a donation to our campaign and following our regular updates.  Anything helps! 

Are there any terms and conditions associated with the perks?Yes. Please visit our Terms and Conditions page.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>It is becoming pretty clear to many people that electric vehicles over the last few years are no longer some futuristic fantasy. A revolution is happening using clean, renewable, de-centralized energy, with battery electric vehicles playing a key role.</p>
<p>Battery electric vehicles do not emit any greenhouse gases. Battery electric vehicles also do not emit toxic pollutants which adversely affect our health. We should not be faced with the choice of dependency on Middle East oil or fracking.

<div><p><b>Today’s Electric Cars Are Not

Electric vehicle charging stations are not a scalable solution to the
adoption of electric vehicles. Most people do not want to wait for at least 30
minutes a small amount of added range (Level 3 charging can take up to 30
minutes for an 80% charge, and Level 2 charging needs four or more hours). In

<p>Batteries currently used in EVs are heavy and large, impossible to replace at home and require specialized equipment only a service station would have. They are also very costly, some comprising about half the value of the total car cost. One of the largest pitfalls of the EV is the range of the battery. The average EPA electric range of most affordable EVs is about 70-100 miles per charge, while some of the higher end cars advertise 265 miles per charge. Additionally, it takes a significant amount of time to charge these batteries to full range. The combination of small range and long charging times pose a significant deterrence to the adoption of EVs as an alternative to gas vehicles.<br/></p>

<b>ONLY 3 HOURS' TRAINING TO POSITIVELY CHANGE SOMEBODY'S LIFE:<br/>ETHICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, HEMP FESTIVAL BANDS </b><br/>Getting Vital Capacity Building Initiatives to the Most Vulnerable of East Timor<br/><br/><b>THE BACKGROUND</b><br/>Hi I'm Andrea.  I've a background in Theatre, Film and Marketing.  For those that don't know, East Timor is the eastern half of a small island between Indonesia and Australia.  They gained independence from Indonesia in 2002 and have since been struggling to re-establish.   Over the past few years I've been funding two small initiatives in East Timor and have acquired a reasonable insight into the people, their culture and history, and the vast array of challenges they face.  <br/><br/>I believe in treating people ethically and in giving them real opportunities to improve their lives.<br/>I get stuff done, <br/>I do it well, <br/>and I care about those I influence along the way.<br/><br/>Recently I was approached by a small Australian festival who'd heard of my work.  They were wanting Ethical, Environmental, NON-TRANSFERABLE Wrist-Bands TO use for their festival.  These would replace the plastic, factory produced variety which are an unnecessary pollutant in our environment.  Plus festival goers would leave their event wearing a reminder of their great festival experience!  Win-win.<br/><br/>I agreed to do a trial run of 2000 wrist-bands to see if it was feasible.<br/><br/>Well.......2000 Enviro-Festival Bands later - YES

Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you. Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.  Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.    The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust.    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>The Result:</b><br/>
The main culprit is that <b><i>the roofs of such buildings/structures are not provided with rain-collectors </i></b>so

In June 2015 we, hydrologist and climate science researcher Zion Klos and environmental artist Lucy Holtsnider, will embark on Climate Odyssey, a year-long sailing expedition spanning the Atlantic coast and northern Caribbean. What's the problem? Climate change impacts are worsening all across the globe and adaptation, particularly in coastal areas, is crucial to spare life and property. However there are many barriers to common sense adaptation efforts and one of them is communication. According to the results of a 2014 IPSOS survey , only 54% of Americans agree that “...the climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity.” [1]What is Climate Odyssey? Climate Odyssey is our answer to this gap in understanding. We will use our complimentary skills in art, science, and communication to bring the urgency of climate change adaptation to new audiences throughout these regions. But we need YOUR help! If you've ever felt discouraged by climate change projections, then help us use a novel form of communication to reinvigorate those who have disengaged from the issue.

But, we can only complete this facility with your support!

Research Tells All




Currently, an estimated 12 million tons of single-use, recyclable, food-grade plastic either ends up in landfills or is exported. [Based on data from the EPA's 2012 Municipal Solid Waste report.]




Exported plastic is typically shipped to China or India, where individuals in poor communities get paid less than $1 per day to hand sort plastic. This turns their neighborhoods into waste yards.  
Problem ... and Solution!
The lack of an efficient method to sort plastic has forced US recycling centers to continue to landfill or export food grade plastic. Our team is stepping in with a new solution. 



We created an automated system to sort plastic by density.

We designed our system to cost only 1/10 of alternative sorting methods
Now... we can recycle plastic in a closed-loop process!



Benefits of Our Process



Curious about the Technology?
Lifecycle sorts food grade plastic by density using simple and safe water bath technology, designed by us. The water bath method causes less dense plastic to float (like wood floats in water) and more dense plastic to sink (like a rock sinks in water), therefore separating the plastic. With multiple baths consisting of different density liquids, many different plastics can be separated.





Help Us Finish What We Started!

To carry out our vision of a world without plastic pollution, we need to get the rest of our equipment
fabricated and installed.  We already
leased the facility and found an awesome team to manage it, but we need YOU to
help complete it with the necessary gear.



Once up and running, our facility will recycle 100,000
pounds per month… AND generate more local jobs. We want you to be a part of this experience! Get involved and contribute today so we can have a better tomorrow!

Let's get nerdy! Different plastic types...




Each plastic has a different number (called a resin code). The code identifies which type of molecule it is made of. Different codes equal different plastic types. A manufacturer typically only uses one type at a time, so they need to be sorted beforehand for them.

Here are examples of items made from different plastics:
#1 - (PET)  water bottles, salad/berry containers, clear in color
#2 - (HDPE)  milk jugs, plastic grocery bags, thick and milky in color, strong
#3 - (PVC) plastic pipes
#4 - (LDPE)  plastic grocery bags, lids to some yogurt containers
#5 - (PP)  yogurt/hummus/butter tubs, disposable cups, slightly milk in color
#6 - (PS)  solo cups
#7 - (Other)  anything that is not #1-6",11.0,1,"1 Campaign
