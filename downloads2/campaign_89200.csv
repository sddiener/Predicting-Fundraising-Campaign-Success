THE PRODUCT

What’s the product?
Protean cases are ultra-thin modular iPhone cases that offer excellent protection. Protean cases allow you to adapt to any situation. We’ve done this by developing a proprietary magnetic technology called MagTec. While all Protean products have MagTec and excellent protective capabilities, there is variation in the features offered by the Slim and Battery models.


Who made it?
We're a team of 6 who come from a variety of backgrounds. We’re engineers, designers, sourcers and manufacturing experts.


Why should we use it?
If you're someone who wants all the benefits of a protective case while keeping your iPhone slim and stylish and adaptable to every scenario, you’ll definitely want this. In our research, cases were either slim and stylish or protective and bulky. Protean is the perfect balance of minimalism, ease of use, and functionality


Where can we buy it?
Right here on Indiegogo! Pre-order yours today and be one of the lucky first to get your hands on the world’s best iPhone case before we source it to the general public.


Why crowdfunding?
We love crowdfunding! For our small business, it’s an amazing platform for allowing us to meet minimum order quantities from our manufacturer, while also making sure that we’re making a product people love through the close connection we have with our backers.


How much does it cost?
Our early backers can get a Slim case and headphone adapter for as low as $30, 60% off the retail price of $75.

FEATURES

Which phones does it work with?
Our base Battery and Slim cases fit for the iPhone 6s and 7. We’re gauging interest in creating a second line that fits the 7 plus.


What colors do you offer?
We’re currently offering the case in jet black, though we’re planning on expanding colors.


What case works for me?
That depends on the day. If you listen to a lot of music or regularly use your phone throughout the day, our Battery case is the best option. If you care more about a minimalist aesthetic and are only using your phone occasionally, our Slim case is the clear choice.


How does the case protect my phone?
Each case has built-in shock absorption, powerful raised lip screen protection, and top-of-the-line drop protection.


Does this case add a lot of bulk to my phone?
Not at all! Our cases are made with incredible protective technology that only adds ~3 mm to your iPhone.


Is the case grippy?
We have gone through multiple refining processes to ensure that our cases are smooth and have sufficient grip on the sides.


What additional features are available?
Each case has small rare earth magnetic plates inside, allowing you to add on our various accessories, including the Anywhere Mount, Photography Kit, Carbon Fiber Wallet, and LoopStand. We'll be unveiling more accessories later in our journey!


How do the accessories connect?
The functionality of the case is enabled through the small rare earth metal plates inside of all our cases. Our accessories magnetize to these plates, forming a secure connection.


Will there be updates to the product in the future?
We're continuing to expand the line of cases to other phone models and we'll be launching additional accessories next year.


Can I still access my charging port?
Yes. We took that into account during design. Like everything else with Protean, plugging in your chargers will be easy.


Is it waterproof?
Protean is water resistant, but not waterproof.


Where is it manufactured?
Shenzhen, China. We have a professional control agency to insure the highest product quality.

REGULATIONS & SAFETY

What are these magnets?
The magnets in our range of accessories provide the optimal balance between strength and attraction. Protean accessories have embedded industrial-strength rare earth magnets that provide a strong, secure fit to the case without causing damage to phones or credit cards.


Will the magnets mess with my phone or credit cards?
The magnets we use in our accessories have been through intensive testing and will not affect your phone, cellular data, credit cards, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Apple Pay or compass.

<h2>Choose your mechanical switches</h2>
<p>What does mechanical keyboard mean? The best explanation can be found <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is relevant though is the color of the mechanical key switches which is a synonym of ""what typing experience you want to have"". They will always be nice to touch and press; a feeling you'll never have with the squishy rubber membrane you find on most keyboards.</p>
<p>Depending on the color of the switches, you'll experience differents sensations: sometimes they'll click (you feel a slight ""bump"" when you push the key) and sometimes they won't; sometimes you'll have press them softly sometimes hardly (this is called ""actuation force"" and its measure is in gf).</p>
<p>There's also the ""travel"" your finger undergo when you push a key, before the information is sent. This is called ""pre-travel"" and it's measured in millimeters.</p>
<ul>
<li>For most gamers, for example, you'll want something linear that is very easy to push so you'll get a very short response time. Those are <strong>red</strong> switches.</li>
<li>For peole who like to type ""hard"", you may want the <strong>black</strong> (<strong>yellow</strong> are the same, just not the same manufacturer) switches: like red but you have to push a bit harder.</li>
<li>For people who like the ""bump"" when they push the key, you'll want the <strong>blue</strong> switches. They give you a really nice ""bump"" sensation, but be careful: they'll click! If you a sensitive to noise this may be a problem.</li>

<h3>PAPYRUS</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>HI, to everyone. Oftentimes I had brilliant ideas on how to make different products that may help our day to day life. Today I want to introduce you a real mobile computer that can be converted in a TV , Laptop or a simple display. Thanks to new technologies, <strong>PAPYRUS</strong>  incorporates a <strong>foldable touch-screen </strong>type  display and a  <strong>foldable luminescent keyboard</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616072069/uifppr3l2jgvojopvxzt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PAPYRUS</strong> can be used as a laptop or a PC monitor. The magnetic wireless charger gives you the opportunity to use the cylinder both vertical or horizontal. The <strong>PAPYRUS</strong> box will contain the cylinder, the magnetic <strong>wireless charger</strong>, and a portable <strong>PC monitor stand</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>In the coming years the mobile device market will be flooded with gadgets that contain flexible screens, so it is time for this product to be feasible. </p>
<p>I am looking to gain the amount of money that is needed to complete a prototype for <strong>PAPYRUS.</strong> At the same time I am looking to create a team that can deliver this product . </p>

<p>I will split the funding for P<strong>APYRUS</strong> in two phases:</p>
</div><div>
<p>Phase 1: Raising Money for The concept campaign :</p>
<p>An amount of <strong>6000 GBP</strong> is needed in order to be able to deliver a professional video promoting the PAPYRUS product together with a <strong>3D realistic</strong> model of the baton display. This money will cover a prototype computer that can demonstrate the mechanical roll-out of the <strong>flexible display</strong> and expenses for further research.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Raising Money for the Prototype and business model set up:</p>
<p>The amount of money needed to build a fully functional prototype with the computing power of a smartphone is estimated at <strong>7000 GBP</strong>. I aim to mass-produce the<strong> PAPYRUS</strong> display at an initial market price of 400 GBP. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>PAPYRUS</strong> will revolutionize the mobile PC market by making available a product that is mobile at a very low cost. The <strong>folding screen</strong> technology is already making a huge difference in the mobile phone market and is now the time to shift to laptops and wearables technology. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616072363/inm9g1yepwsm5vir0zqs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>PAPYRUS</strong> is a cylinder containing a computer and two rolling out film, both of them being touch screen type folding displays. The first is at a dimension of 330 mm/220 mm and is used for the display role.  The second screen will roll out of the cylinder in case you need a keyboard.  All of this is happening by <strong>vocal command</strong> or by touching the cylinder twice with the finger.</p>
<p> The<strong> PAPYRUS</strong> display will be a <strong>4K  Full HD</strong> display at a refresh rate of <strong>144 Hz</strong>, perfectly adaptable for cloud gaming through the latest wi-fi chip module.  The product includes a SIM card adaptor for <strong>5G</strong> networks as well.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> Investing in<strong> PAPYRUS </strong>is a way to make future like technologies available to everyone. <strong>PAPYRUS</strong> is committed to be an <strong>eco-friendly </strong>company, delivering a product that is mostly recyclable. <strong>PAPYRUS</strong> is going to be a <strong>modular product</strong> and will respect <strong>THE RIGHT TO REPAIR</strong> from the first day.  Every time that a new, more advanced folding display is available, the costumer will be able to replace the old one with it without throwing away the entire product. This is what I consider to be our duty for the environment and the generation to come. </p>
<p>    <strong>PAPYRUS</strong> will  demonstrate that a simple product can overcome the necessity of space, travel , speed and durability at the same time. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>On the road to make <strong>PAPYRUS</strong> available into a physical product, we need to overcome many challenges. Amid to COVID 19 crisis, finance, delivery times and reservation had been all altered.  In response to all of these problems, I do believe that a product like <strong>PAPYRUS</strong> is more than welcome. More and more people need access to technology and to cheap , <strong>good quality</strong> computers. The folding screen producers are ready to deliver high-quality displays as soon as the market will offer a product for their use.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any volunteer work is welcome. Advice and mentoring are welcome as well. Please share and make PAPYRUS be known. Hope to see all of you on Phase 2 of the campaign.</p>

 Investing in PAPYRUS is a way to make future like technologies available to everyone. PAPYRUS is committed to be an eco-friendly company, delivering a product that is mostly recyclable. PAPYRUS is going to be a modular product and will respect THE RIGHT TO REPAIR from the first day.  Every time that a new, more advanced folding display is available, the costumer will be able to replace the old one with it without throwing away the entire product. This is what I consider to be our duty for the environment and the generation to come. 
    PAPYRUS will  demonstrate that a simple product can overcome the necessity of space, travel , speed and durability at the same time. 

Risks & Challenges
On the road to make PAPYRUS available into a physical product, we need to overcome many challenges. Amid to COVID 19 crisis, finance, delivery times and reservation had been all altered.  In response to all of these problems, I do believe that a product like PAPYRUS is more than welcome. More and more people need access to technology and to cheap , good quality computers. The folding screen producers are ready to deliver high-quality displays as soon as the market will offer a product for their use.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Any volunteer work is welcome. Advice and mentoring are welcome as well. Please share and make PAPYRUS be known. Hope to see all of you on Phase 2 of the campaign.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

	In June 2014 we started developing Exahome out of frustration with existing home automation solutions. Two Exahome systems have been running since November 2014 / May 2015 without any critical errors. We are now focused on finalizing and testing our module designs and improving the user experience of the mobile app. The next steps are FCC/CE certification and preparing our designs for production. We expect to ship the first Exahome units to our backers in June 2016, after which we will continue improving and extending our hardware and provide software updates for already installed systems.

<p>
	We want to keep the risk low for you and for ourselves. We know we can bring Exahome to you if this campaign is successfully funded.

Remove the need to replace broken cables
Resolve tangling mess of cables
Create a beautiful home for your phone to rest on while charging without have to keep plugging in and out which could damage the life of your phone




After a  year of researching, designing, prototyping and fine-tuning, we are happy to announce Qidock, our solution to mobile charging.


  Danguard Company's goal is to deliver the next popular technology to everyone at superb quality and down-to-earth price.

Qidock has been on our primary focus in Jan 2014.  It takes longer than we anticipated because we want to delivery a best design at highest quality and affordable cost.
Qidock is produced in Vietnam and goes through rigorous quality control process. 

This is our first project on Indiegogo, help us continue publishing more quality products by Contributing Now.
  Why wait? Untangled yourself of cables, save money.


What We Need & What You Get We need $10,000.00 for initial expense with molding and tooling.  Contribute now and help us get this project off the ground. 

Save Money:  No more new cables every few months, save hundred of dollars off the cost of replacing broken cables.

Be Organized: No more accidentally yanking your phone off while charging.  No more stumbling through cables trying to answer a call or message.

Give Your Device a Home:  By giving your device an attractive home, you won’t have to worry about finding where you put your device again.

Perfect Viewing Angle:  A perfect viewing angle for video calls, reading messages/notifications, watching movies, and more without running out of battery.

More than a dock: You'll fall in-love with the product the moment you set your eyes on it; so will everyone else.  It's a perfect conversation starter in an office! 

 Risks & Challenges  We have all process and technical risks resolved.  Our only concern risk now is delivery schedule as it is #1 realized risk for all projects.   To offset this risk, we plan to proceed with our tooling ordering as soon as our Early Bird Special Perk is sold out to get a head start on our schedule.

Our schedule for Qidock


We used 3d printer to print our prototypes for quick validation.  Production units are produced with high tech molding machinery for precision and quality.
Qidock within reach and no cable to deal with, a perfect home for your  phone.

<h3>The BadgerSkins Kit:</h3>
<div>The kit is designed to go beyond how traditional magnetic mounts work. The BadgerSkin Kit allows users to no longer utilize an unwanted case which hides the magnetic metal plate or to have an unwanted metal plate on the outside of a case. Now with BadgerPlate; users can have a metal plate that is specifically designed to mimic the colors of the phones' metal and/or plastic finish or choose any of the bright and vibrant colors that are offered. The plate can then be hidden behind any of our beautiful vinyl skins. This allows anyone to customize the look of their phone with awesome patterns and colors. </div>

<p>The thick part of the cable never breaks—it’s the thin part that’s the problem, especially the part that connects to the power brick. Using this keeps the connection sturdy, thus it will be harder to break that link. No statistics—yet simple common sense.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Keep your Charger Cool</b></p>
<p>This keeps your power brick off the ground: better ventilation, better cooling. Now instead of burning hot, your charger will be just hot.</p>

<p>Currently, I made a final mock-up, carved using a 5-axis CNC mill, which nearly perfectly mimic its quality and look if Magroll was to be mass-produced through plastic extrusion. The team tested the product for weeks by personal use, and I am now ready for production.</p>
<p><b>But we need you.</b></p>
<p>As you know, I want to be uncompromising in quality for this product; Apple designs products for artists, I wanted its peripherals to be just as good. Plastic was my solution. Plastic is strong yet light; perhaps a reason why Apple uses them for the MagSafe chargers in the first place. It has low heat conduction: a good choice for enclosing a power brick that radiates heat.</p>
<p>Plastic extrusion currently provides the best quality and also has the best characteristics for mass-production, yet it is unmatched in the start-up costs. Molds for extrusion are expensive, and I need to make eight for this product—four for the case, four for the rubber inserts. As a student, I am unable to afford the huge lump-sum costs; I am turning to Indiegogo to make this dream become reality.</p>

</div></div>","Tidy It: once you roll it up, it stays that way.Save It: using the thick power cable is the intrinsic solution to save your charger.
Roll It: easy-to-unroll solution for a constant traveler.
Product Description

 
Take the Magroll out. As you might guess—your earphones or cables are not dangling out with it.

Deploy your charger in seconds—just pull the cord. Hold Magroll on your hand, pull the cord, it unwinds like magic. 

Unwind just enough of the Mac-side of the charger for it to reach your MacBook. That cable won’t unwind: the rubber inserts keep it in its place. Hear the satisfactory click.


When done, wind up the thin power cable; click it in the rubber inserts. Slide in the head to the hole at the top; it is secured magnetically.


Now, twist the Magroll; the cable winds up in 6-7 turns. Throw it in your bag, and you are ready to go.

Other Benefits
Safe from Wear & Tear


The thick part of the cable never breaks—it’s the thin part that’s the problem, especially the part that connects to the power brick. Using this keeps the connection sturdy, thus it will be harder to break that link. No statistics—yet simple common sense.

Keep your Charger Cool
This keeps your power brick off the ground: better ventilation, better cooling. Now instead of burning hot, your charger will be just hot.

Development
I have made 10+ prototypes on CAD, and printed dozens on my 3D printer.

Currently, I made a final mock-up, carved using a 5-axis CNC mill, which nearly perfectly mimic its quality and look if Magroll was to be mass-produced through plastic extrusion. The team tested the product for weeks by personal use, and I am now ready for production.
But we need you.
As you know, I want to be uncompromising in quality for this product; Apple designs products for artists, I wanted its peripherals to be just as good. Plastic was my solution. Plastic is strong yet light; perhaps a reason why Apple uses them for the MagSafe chargers in the first place. It has low heat conduction: a good choice for enclosing a power brick that radiates heat.
Plastic extrusion currently provides the best quality and also has the best characteristics for mass-production, yet it is unmatched in the start-up costs. Molds for extrusion are expensive, and I need to make eight for this product—four for the case, four for the rubber inserts. As a student, I am unable to afford the huge lump-sum costs; I am turning to Indiegogo to make this dream become reality.

We know what we're talking about. Our teams have built tech that powers the net. Today more than 300M people in 77 countries rely on our products. In fact, there's a very good chance that these bits are flowing through gateways we built for our beloved cable and wireless companies. These flows are being measured, cataloged and analyzed for a wide range of purposes (good and bad). </div><p>Until now there's been two ways for you to hide from the bad guys:</p><div>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Disconnect yourself, go off the grid, and learn to love the post office;</li>
<li>Use the infamous (and slow) TOR browser, which is maintained by an organization whose CEO takes keen, personal interest in some of his employees - and was cracked last year by some really smart guys @ Carnegie Mellon funded by a government agency.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, given these rather limited options, how can a guy or gal get some real privacy these days? Well, thanks to some really smart guys of our own, we've developed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cenotes</a> - your Personal Privacy Appliance (PPA).</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Cenotes is a small, low-cost, carrier-class Internet appliance that sits quietly between your home or office network and your ISP's gateway. Its purpose in life is to enable you to ""hide in plain sight"". Cenotes does this by encrypting and then ricocheting your information flows randomly through PPAs scattered about the globe before delivering them to their destinations. Thus making it virtually impossible for spies and other mischevious eyes to track you online.  It's a devilishly simple concept that is a bit tricky to put to practice. </span></p>
</div><div>
<p>The good news is we aren't building custom hardware this time around - there's no need for it these days. Cenotes is built with carrier-class software, ported onto the infamous Raspberry Pi 3, which is then coupled to a scalable, redundant service controller. It's seamless, transparent and maintenance free. That said, for those with the need, we also provide a management portal where you can monitor and tweak your PPA to your heart's delight.</p>
<p>And just to be clear, thanks to our clever system design we will never see, hear, touch (or smell) your data traffic at any time (nor will anyone else).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

</div><div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Next Steps</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We've been developing Cenotes for the better part of a year and are getting ready to launch our Beta program this October. To make this meaningful we are looking for at least 500 brave souls to sponsor this pioneering adventure.  As a one of our sponsors you can: </span></p>
</div><div> <ul> <li>Receive one of the first Cenotes PPAs to hit the street;</li>
<li>Get a lifetime of service and software upgrades;</li>
<li>Bring dignity, privacy and security back into this crazy world we live in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Beta program is expected to last about 90 days. During this period we will be collecting performance data, your feedback and making tweaks to the plaform accordingly. Software updates will be made to PPAs on an ""as needed"" basis and only in the wee hours of the night.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Beta program we will begin making Cenotes available to the general public in the Jan'17 timeframe. We expect to ""sell"" the PPA for $65.00, which covers our loaded costs, and plan to offer the service to residences @ $10/yr and businesses @ $10/yr/employee.

Like our ancient ancestors, modern hunters are on the prowl, tracking us in cyberspace, searching for their prey of the day. We know what we're talking about. Our teams have built tech that powers the net. Today more than 300M people in 77 countries rely on our products. In fact, there's a very good chance that these bits are flowing through gateways we built for our beloved cable and wireless companies. These flows are being measured, cataloged and analyzed for a wide range of purposes (good and bad). Until now there's been two ways for you to hide from the bad guys:


Disconnect yourself, go off the grid, and learn to love the post office;
Use the infamous (and slow) TOR browser, which is maintained by an organization whose CEO takes keen, personal interest in some of his employees - and was cracked last year by some really smart guys @ Carnegie Mellon funded by a government agency.

So, given these rather limited options, how can a guy or gal get some real privacy these days? Well, thanks to some really smart guys of our own, we've developed Cenotes - your Personal Privacy Appliance (PPA).

Cenotes is a small, low-cost, carrier-class Internet appliance that sits quietly between your home or office network and your ISP's gateway. Its purpose in life is to enable you to ""hide in plain sight"". Cenotes does this by encrypting and then ricocheting your information flows randomly through PPAs scattered about the globe before delivering them to their destinations. Thus making it virtually impossible for spies and other mischevious eyes to track you online.  It's a devilishly simple concept that is a bit tricky to put to practice. 

The good news is we aren't building custom hardware this time around - there's no need for it these days. Cenotes is built with carrier-class software, ported onto the infamous Raspberry Pi 3, which is then coupled to a scalable, redundant service controller. It's seamless, transparent and maintenance free. That said, for those with the need, we also provide a management portal where you can monitor and tweak your PPA to your heart's delight.
And just to be clear, thanks to our clever system design we will never see, hear, touch (or smell) your data traffic at any time (nor will anyone else).




Interested in joining our Cenotes Underground Movement? If so, read on!


Next Steps
We've been developing Cenotes for the better part of a year and are getting ready to launch our Beta program this October. To make this meaningful we are looking for at least 500 brave souls to sponsor this pioneering adventure.  As a one of our sponsors you can: 
  Receive one of the first Cenotes PPAs to hit the street;
Get a lifetime of service and software upgrades;
Bring dignity, privacy and security back into this crazy world we live in.

The Beta program is expected to last about 90 days. During this period we will be collecting performance data, your feedback and making tweaks to the plaform accordingly. Software updates will be made to PPAs on an ""as needed"" basis and only in the wee hours of the night.
At the conclusion of the Beta program we will begin making Cenotes available to the general public in the Jan'17 timeframe. We expect to ""sell"" the PPA for $65.00, which covers our loaded costs, and plan to offer the service to residences @ $10/yr and businesses @ $10/yr/employee. These fees will be used to maintain and enhance Cenote's service offerings. Enhancements in the works include Secure Remote Access, Ad Blocking, Tracking Cookie Blocking and some other very clever services.
A Few Rules to Muse
We've designed Cenotes for people like us.  People that want to take back their privacy in a world where real-time surveallance, big data analytics and AI driven predictive modeling continue to erode our personal space. To foster this movement responsibly, we've drafted a few rules to muse:
  Cenotes is designed for and intended to be used by people with the legitimate need and desire for enhanced privacy online.  Dark Web product/service providers and their customers need not apply;
We reserve the right to refuse to Cenotes to potential customers that have questionable backgrounds or motives.  We also reserve the right to terminate service to such individuals and organizations at anytime;
Under no circumstance do we accept responsibility for actions taken by or consquences resulting from people using Cenotes;
Cenotes is provided ""as is"" without any warranty, implied or otherwise.  You assume any and all risk and potential losses in its use; We want you to be active members of the Cenotes Underground Movement.  We welcome open and honest feedback and promise to use your feeback in making Cenotes better for all.
As Cenotes matures, we will be introducing a ""friends and family"" program to grow the underground movement far and wide, and compensate people in the process.

During the lockdown in my family daily life, where we spent lots of time living slowly bonding together, PAL has helped us enjoyed so many meaningful moments just at our own home such as:</p><p><i><strong>- Sleeping</strong></i>: I have 2 babies, one was born in 2019 &amp; the other was born in 2020, as you may know, making them both sleep at nights is sometimes a hell of work!!! Luckily, when I tried to apply PAL function, I put all the phones we have, turn flashlights on, and slide PAL gadgets over with different colours...and IT WORKED!!! My babies are both quiet, slowly closing their eyes and fall asleep. I have been so much grateful for this technique.</p><p><i><strong>- Meditation: </strong></i>during the lockdown time, my wife and I spent lots of time meditation to make our inner souls feel calmer, understand ourselves and the current situation happening across the world more, we do chakra meditation every night after the babies sleep. It helps so much with the ambient vibes that PAL provides us, for eg. Monday with Root chakra under red, Thursday with Heart chakra under green or Friday with Throat chakra under blue...The lights surrounded helps a lot for visulising the flowers inside of our bodies and our meditation has become much more quality for our body, soul &amp; mind union.</p><p><i><strong>- Chill out:</strong></i> staying at home regulation has created certain pressures for parents to keep the children entertained indoors mostly, and in my case I play a little role like an magician, let my toddler select everyday different colour of PAL in his room, then I made it on, turn on some music and he was like: ""wowwww"", dancing and having fun for a while, the newborn baby was also happy to watch around with excited eyes. As a father, I am so happy with this small little trick.</p><p><i><strong>- Creativity: </strong></i>one of my favorite hobbies is meditation under the cold shower, somehow the light in our bathroom is just too much brighter for a small areas, so what I do is I always keep the light off, I bring my mobile, make PAL on...and thank God, the whole vibe turns just so nice and gentle, I can shower for hours under this ambient as my mind has never been more relaxed and ideas flow was just coming all out efficiently under the water and PAL's atmosphere. I could not believe with small, cheap gadget can bring about so much funs and quality in life. </p><p>And so on..., I hope to receive many feedbacks and stories from everyone in the future how PAL has assisted your life turn better.

The utmost satisfaction at that time was when I saw all my products being displayed on the shelves in stores and people bought them, the cashiers scanned their barcodes...And that was when I realized how much I love Product Development so much, not just any products, but those that must bring impact and helpfulness.</p><p><strong><u><i>*The next part of my life - called Not Giving Up:</i></u></strong></p><p> After the early success, together with many events in life, I decided to move to the UK to start a new life in my late 20s. I have lived over 10 Years in the UK now, striving with lots of things and meanwhile building of my passion with the Product Development. With over 15 years of investing time and effort in what I love, it has provided my with huge experiences over many things with a Start-Up: from the Idea to the Prototype, from the industrialization to the Mass production and the market placement. </p><p>With PAL project, I have followed and researched in a long way and already applied on myself. It has helped me a lot in many ways as I am a frequent light - user on many occassions: sleeping, reading, showering, meditating, playing with my children...The normal flashlight on our phone is just too much, if you agree with me, and with a small shift, a small gadget becomes the real game changer. PAL has taught me about patience, love and harmony to myself and my family, and under no circumstances, I will NOT GIVE UP my dream and passion somewhere in life. We have made it through the pandemic with love till now and we would live to spread it to anyone in need of it.</p><p><strong><u><i>*The coming part of my life - called You Made It:</i></u></strong></p><p>Of course, any Start-Up's journey is not easy, it has been going with many different experiements in the lab, to make sure about the quality of the product, and its versatile in any platforms. And it worths every single effort as I always believe that good things take times, and hard work pays off one day.</p><p>Finally I could fulfill my passion with something that I love by myself, and hopefully I can be able to return an added value to the society, rather than just taking, taking, and taking. </p><p>We are ready to give up the big stake of our margin in order to make our dream come true. And definitely you are as single investors, will help this path become possible. We appreciate any of small support to complete the name You Made It in this chapter.</p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610280569/ltt0foruzkbmoyjtgkjt.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><h2> </h2><h3><strong>G.

That would be the most rewarding gift to me and PAL team and the whole purpose of this project.F. Background Overview*The first part of my life - called Early Success:Growing up in Germany with my family, I was fortunate enough when I reached my early 20s, I was successfully brought a household product into many big chains of supermarkets and helped many households to provide good care for their plants in the houses. The utmost satisfaction at that time was when I saw all my products being displayed on the shelves in stores and people bought them, the cashiers scanned their barcodes...And that was when I realized how much I love Product Development so much, not just any products, but those that must bring impact and helpfulness.*The next part of my life - called Not Giving Up: After the early success, together with many events in life, I decided to move to the UK to start a new life in my late 20s. I have lived over 10 Years in the UK now, striving with lots of things and meanwhile building of my passion with the Product Development. With over 15 years of investing time and effort in what I love, it has provided my with huge experiences over many things with a Start-Up: from the Idea to the Prototype, from the industrialization to the Mass production and the market placement. With PAL project, I have followed and researched in a long way and already applied on myself. It has helped me a lot in many ways as I am a frequent light - user on many occassions: sleeping, reading, showering, meditating, playing with my children...The normal flashlight on our phone is just too much, if you agree with me, and with a small shift, a small gadget becomes the real game changer. PAL has taught me about patience, love and harmony to myself and my family, and under no circumstances, I will NOT GIVE UP my dream and passion somewhere in life. We have made it through the pandemic with love till now and we would live to spread it to anyone in need of it.*The coming part of my life - called You Made It:Of course, any Start-Up's journey is not easy, it has been going with many different experiements in the lab, to make sure about the quality of the product, and its versatile in any platforms. And it worths every single effort as I always believe that good things take times, and hard work pays off one day.Finally I could fulfill my passion with something that I love by myself, and hopefully I can be able to return an added value to the society, rather than just taking, taking, and taking. We are ready to give up the big stake of our margin in order to make our dream come true. And definitely you are as single investors, will help this path become possible. We appreciate any of small support to complete the name You Made It in this chapter. G. Risks & ChallengesAny business always has its risk & challenges, and we are not exceptional. However, as founder and invetors of PAL, we have done a thorough risk analysis to understand our proposition in the market and our core competences and well planned for it.- We know that our technology is ahead of everyone else and this is just the beginning.- We welcome every similar product on the market as proof that our concept is brilliant.- We are working hard to provide high-end edge technologies to our customers and cannot wait to establish the trust of keeping our promise, by constantly improving and being up to date with the market demand.Please rest assured that we have worked deeply to mitigate the risk at best and the result will make the noise for our beloved users.  H. What We Need & What You GetFolks let's get on an enlightened journey together, you can follow and see by yourself how PAL transform a boring room to a  one with your selected colours without flashing directly in your eyes and disturbing the great atmosphere alone, with friends, family in style.Your Mobile & PAL is all you need, Mobile Ambient Light helps you to spend more quality time in any room. This Game Changer product starts with its first version, and will move to the next level wherever the universe respond to our efforts through our customers' support.

What Do We Need? We, as a second year team, are limited with our supplies and money.This is why we are in the need of your help.Here are some subjects that we think should be cleared out before you contribute.  Your contribution is going directly to building and manufacturing the best robot that is possible to assemble with the money given to us.Nontheless in order to get as high as we can on the leaderboard, we need every cent you can donate and every single dollar is more appreciated then ever.Our team spends tremendous amount of money and time each year to even be able to participate FRC, spending almost 20000$ to get in the competition and manufarcturing our parts to the robot.Building the demo of the field also requires amount of money that we are in the lack of due to us being a second year team.Even though last year we had almost no money to spend on the robot, we made most of our parts using our creativity and assembling the parts out of recycled materials, which means that if you help and contribute and we will have money, our robot will win much more award and will function with more efficiency. Your contribution will not go unnoticed!all of the donors will recieve a token of our appreciation that will be mentioned in the donating options in the page. The funding we will gather will go directly to the manufacturing of our robot even if we dont reach our final goal, and thats because every donation is importent, appreciated and will be used.    Our Competition With A Bit More Details The FRC throughout this year is all about the middle ages.Two alliances go against each other with their fearsome robots.The main goal of the games is to cross the enemy's traps, called outerworks and to supposedly break their defenses.each time you pass a defense you are getting an amount of points.there are boulders on the ground on the arena in specific area, and the goal is to score them into the opponent's castle, causing the tower to lose its point, leading to it's downfall.all of those goals of the game awards you with diffrent points amount which causes your alliance either to win, lose or get to a draw situation with the enemy alliance.alliances changing throughout the games and thats the reason why our robot has to operate with itself as good as its operating with the teams of the alliances.  The competition is made to encourage teenagers to participate and create robot out of scratch, causing the teams to gain experience how to work with teams, learning how to co-operate with teammates and most importently getting a sneak pick into the robotics world which we are living in today. We have proven ourselves as a rookie team by winning the global best rookie team award and getting to the 'Rookies All Star', following another set of awards we got in our country. We will be more than happy to get contribution and every contribution will be important, from 1$ up to 200$ or more we will be exited and greatful to anyone who donate us what he can.    The Big Challenge Within the 6 weeks of building we are facing an tremendous amount of challenges, the mechanisms, the media works of the team, the sponsering that people give us and the one we are trying to get and many more.But even though we are facing challenges we have proven before, while we were rookies that we can face challenges with astounding efficiency and creativity.Your contribution will help us to get over those challenges and face them with more efficiency throughout the final weeks of building.  As mentioned we have already overcomed tremendous amount of challenges like our economic state of last year and even mechanism problems we had last year and are having right now.  this challenges are being dealt with as you read this, we are working non-stop, day and night in our workshop to overcome those problems and issues so no worries, we are working!    Got No Way To Donate? You Can Still Help Us! even if you cant really donate and dont meet the requirements to do so you can still help us!  Spread the rumor! Go to your manager, boss, friends and family and tell them about this project!We would really appreciate even if you just tell people about the FRC project, this is a project with great cause of getting teenagers familiar to the robotics industry Use Indiegogo share tools and you can make your own contribution causes!!!

<h3>QiPet Wireless Charging Station</h3>
<p>Hello crowdfunding friends,</p>
<p>    My name is Aaron Rasor, CEO and Founder of Rasor Thin Wireless LLC. I would like to introduce you to the QiPet wireless charger. I founded this company to bring my innovative ideas to the world. I am a service connected disabled veteran and a ""tech nerd"". Through my research I saw a need for a different kind of wireless charging station. Currently you can buy hundreds of different wireless chargers, but they all have one thing in common. They are meant for the upscale, suit and tie, business executive type. Though our company has nothing against them we knew there was an opening in the market for everyone else. Currently wireless chargers are flat, some round, some oval, some plastic, some wood, and in a word, they are ""boring"".  We believe it is time to bring wireless charging to the rest of the world with a new design.

Hello crowdfunding friends,
    My name is Aaron Rasor, CEO and Founder of Rasor Thin Wireless LLC. I would like to introduce you to the QiPet wireless charger. I founded this company to bring my innovative ideas to the world. I am a service connected disabled veteran and a ""tech nerd"". Through my research I saw a need for a different kind of wireless charging station. Currently you can buy hundreds of different wireless chargers, but they all have one thing in common. They are meant for the upscale, suit and tie, business executive type. Though our company has nothing against them we knew there was an opening in the market for everyone else. Currently wireless chargers are flat, some round, some oval, some plastic, some wood, and in a word, they are ""boring"".  We believe it is time to bring wireless charging to the rest of the world with a new design. A cute, soft, and fully compatible wireless charger that anyone can set on their nightstand, desk, living room table, or anywhere you need to charge your mobile devices.  With multi-positional charging you can now charge your phone while watching a video, listening to music, or any other task at a comfortable angle and without worrying about scratching your expensive mobile device.
Please help us to bring QiPet to the world. The prototype is complete and now we are looking for help to get the product to market.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>

<b></b><p>Since I’ve launched my crazy crowdfunding campaign on Monday, my Dad has called me a few times. Trying to find the right words to ask me why I’m doing what I’m doing. ‘I’m crowdfunding Dad’. My 75 year old dad doesn’t understand what ‘crowdfunding’ is – actually not a lot do. ‘I’m literally asking each and everyone for a donation to help me build this app’. Silence. He still doesn’t get it, nor does he understand what an ‘app’ even is. Even over the phone, I can feel his sadness. ‘Because I’m chasing my dream Dad. Because I don’t want to regret not putting myself out there and not knowing the full potential of this idea.’ Now I know what it means to crowdfund. Putting yourself out there and just really going for it … it’s so scary … but at the same time … I feel alive.</p>
<p>I’m asking you friends, family, colleagues, people who are liking this page to support me in building this app because I know I can bring this to life. This is what I do, I manage software projects. It’s so close, you can see in the prototype videos where all my free time has been spent. Learning photoshop and all kinds of tools to bootstrap this campaign. I believe that passing notes, writing it, reading it, brings feel good feelings. I believe that. I don’t want the art of passing notes to die. I want to make it even more fun. I want people to feel what I felt when I got these folded notes.</p>
<p>You’ve liked this page, looked at our content and liked it. I now need your support to reach our goal by June 30. You’ll be part of making this app. You can give us feedback – be part of this process. You’ll be part of something that could be something special. You’ll get to download the app for free in September, use it daily, enjoy it, feel good, make others feel good. We are hustling like never before. So I’m asking, for an exchange, between you and I.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we can move forward and build the app. We only have until June 30. We’ve already talked to awesome developers who are ready to build it. But if we don’t make our goal, we can’t bring this new and at the same time nostalgic experience to life. Back us. It’s a labor of love.</p>

</div></div>","SolarX is beautifully and unapologetically designed. Its carefully sculpted shape and seductive contours truly reveals the work of art that went into the design. Made with high-impact resistant acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and durable polycarbonate (PC), its curved and smooth body naturally conforms to the palm of your hand.At Solocharg, we hand-pick the finest parts for our devices. That's why SolarX has a 1.5W thin, high-efficiency epoxy resin-encapsulated solar panel.SolarX has an exceptionally powerful and remarkably safe rechargeable battery. With its 10,000mAh battery capacity, you will expect SolarX to be heavy, it’s actually not. It's surprisingly light.With the built-in USB-C ports, you will be thrilled to see your devices charge faster than usual. Plus, you can be confident to charge your most power-hungry devices at their maximum charge rates. We engineered SolarX to charge any device from any manufacturer. Not only that, we also rigorously tested it with smartphones, tablets, MP3s, cameras, e-readers, earpieces and more. SolarX automatically detects your devices and allows them to use the maximum power needed and maximum charge rate for super-fast charging. During our initial tests, we watched an Apple iPhone 5S charge from 0% to 60% in just 30 minutes; and a Samsung Galaxy S4 from 0% to 60% in just 40 minutes. The full charge times were 1.25 hours for the iPhone, and 1.50 hours for the Galaxy.Why wait for one device to charge before charging the next? Your life is empowered by many great gadgets. That’s why SolarX allows you to charge up to two devices simultaneously.We know you own and cherish various fun gadgets. Unfortunately, they sometimes have different charging ports. With that in mind, your SolarX ships with two fast-charge cables (Micro USB and Apple Lightning) and an optional USB-C to USB-A adapter. 





SolarX has a crystal-clear, cool-white, super-bright LED flashlight. Its 32 lumens combined with a wide 120-degree viewing angle, ensure that a large area is well illuminated.



The built-in micro USB port lets you recharge SolarX whenever you get a low battery indication. 


With the Solocharg SolarBoost technology, the solar panel will quietly and quickly recharge the internal battery; so you don’t have to. That way, SolarX will always be ready for when you need it.  
By boosting the energy of the solar panel, the internal battery almost always has an energy reservoir for the next device charging cycle.


Protect and personalize your SolarX with a multi-color, multi-function protective case that allows you to kickstand, hang, or hook your SolarX for maximum sunlight capture.









We are a team of dedicated and experienced engineers, designers, and product developers. We have been working hard to bring you SolarX and we are certain that you will love it. However, without an initial capital, SolarX will not be able to make it into the hands of people, like you, who need power on the go. The fund raised on Indiegogo will go toward manufacturing, parts procurement, assembly line setting, and production of SolarX.
With your help, SolarX will become a part of many people's lives and those in urgent need of such an innovative device will be ever so grateful for your contribution.",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our company has already brought one product to the market, our MJ7HDTV Android HDTV Tuner tablet, so we have the experience of designing, testing, and bringing to market a complete product.Our plan now is to bring to the world market a tablet specifically designed and tailored for the openSUSE Leap operating system, not only for use by the avid Linux user, but also for the everyday user, thus bringing the benefits of Linux to people around the world.Our goal is to make a superior tablet, both in build quality and hardware performance. This lets consumers then decide how they can utilize it to their best advantage. Whether that is a dual boot Windows 10/openSUSE Leap Distribution for a system administrator needing to manage multiple servers remotely, or just openSUSE Leap as your sole operating system for personal use, we have a tablet that will fit all of your needs.The preinstalled image on the Warrior Tablet Series will be GNOME on openSUSE Leap, but users are welcome to change/reinstall/use Tumbleweed/etc. Any hardware support will be upstream via OBS, therefore will not impede different usage patterns. No lock-in here you the user have the choice always.We are seeking $100,000.00 for the factory start-up and initial tooling costs to help bring this tablet design to the world market. We are ready to move forward with final production at this point, and are asking for your support, to help us make the World’s First actual Made-for- Linux x86/x64 Tablet a reality.We want the user to have the choice of what operating system and software they want for their given application. Even if a user would like multiple operating systems on one tablet, such as openSUSE Linux Distribution or any other OS you can dream of, we can provide the user with the options they need.openSUSE is one of the mostly widely used and recognized consumer and enterprise oriented Linux distributions to date, therefore it was the most logical choice to start our tablet development with. This allows the user immediate access to the hundreds of thousands of applications/games already available on Linux.MJ Technology presents our ""Warrior"" series of Tablets.

<p><i>It takes very little for malicious people to break your privacy while you are connected to internet. The time to read an email, to post a tweet, check your favourite site and even read this sentence. But now there is a way to protect yourself, it is the <b>SHADOWER</b>. Thanks to it, n</i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">o one will know where or who you are from your
online activity.</i></p>
<p></p><h3>What is the SHADOWER?</h3>
<p>The SHADOWER is a powerful wireless
router that allows to connect to internet in an anonymous manner. It can replace your router or be connected to it and by simply<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> pressing the SHADOWER button, it creates a second network called

data that leaks during Internet use.</span></p>
<p></p><h3>The technicalities behind it!</h3><div>The SHADOWER is based on a custom high-performance router optimized to run TOR, which is considered the best and most secure way to access the Internet anonymously. It<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> allows encrypting
Internet usage with a device that secures all web traffic, without any software
running on connected devices.</span><br/>
</div>
<p></p><h3>Is TOR fully secure?</h3>
<p>Used wrongly, no.</p>
<p>TOR is about hiding your IP address,
not hiding your traffic content, which is what we all mostly need. Tor is
an acronym for “The Onion Router”. It is so named because it works by wrapping
your Internet access request in several layers of encryption and, then,
sends it through an automatically generated chain of computer nodes in
various locations. At some point, the request is unwrapped and sent
to its final Internet destination.</p>
<p>The TOR node that performs the final
unwrapping is called the exit node. The exit node decrypts the packet received
from its sibling on the chain of nodes and receives the full plaintext, request submitting it on the requester's behalf to the intended destination. The
exit node waits for the response, encrypts it, and  will send the
encrypted response back to the requester through the node chain. The TOR client
decrypts the packet from the chain sibling and presents it with a
comprehensible piece of data.</p>
<p>It is very important to be aware of
the risks of sending plaintext over TOR, but you should really consider
the risks of sending plaintext over non-TOR connections too! When you use TOR
other people on the local network and the ISP cannot see what websites you are
looking at, and the website operators cannot know where you are located. When
you are not using the TOR, your data is unencrypted and third parties are
able to see and tamper with your data. Tor allow you to prevent that!</p>
<p></p><h3>When is it fully safe to use the
SHADOWER?</h3>
<p>When you want to protect your
location...no one will know where or who you are. BUT the data being
transferred is not safe, so all data content can be read; it is not as easy as
on direct connection but it can be done, so avoid sending your personal data
when using TOR if NO other secure layer such as https is in use.</p>
<p>How to use it?</p>
<p>The SHADOWER can replace your current
router or it can be connected to it. Plug the Shadower into your regular Internet
cable (or router), power it up and that’s it. It will immediately provide
an unprotected wireless network (ShadowerOpen) and, if the Shadower button is
pressed, a protected one (ShadowerNet). In this way, you can decide when you
want to be anonymous online and when not.</p>
<p>It is very simple. All the hard work
is being done by the Shadower in the background without you realizing or
worrying about it. And any device can use it!</p>
<p></p><h3>WAIT! What about TOR Browser, VPN and similar cheaper devices??</h3><p></p><p><span>The idea of the Shadower is to use a simple device that attached to or replacing your your router can provide a ""protected"" wifi network.

Which type of earphones are you using as an Apple user living in the wireless world?






Wired? or wireless?

Most iPhone users use the earpods provided with the iPhone, while some users who prefer the convenience of wireless would pay considerable thoughts and prices to choose the right product from various types and countless brands of Bluetooth products. 

   What You Get?
 
We have created a stylish product that works together with the remote controller on the earpods to operate via Bluetooth connection.




The earpods provided for the Apple users have a built-in microphone and are controlled with three buttons.  The quality and performance of these earphones are also excellent.

Bluepin, when connected to the earpods, can operate the Apple device using the remote controller on the earpods based on the synchronized Bluetooth.

Comparison With Existing Product

Bluepin has nothing else but a power button and a micro 5-pin, 3.5MM port for the earphones.  It is beautiful, simple and stylish.

Symetium can also connect multiple

works like a monitor. But instead of mirroring the UI from the phone itself, it
streams an entirely separate interface allowing the user to still use the phone
without any interruptions while it's streaming a separate UI environment in the
background. <div>

<p><b>Symetium OS Android 6.0 Marshmallow</b><br/></p>
<p>SymetiumOS is a UI designed with minimalism and elegance in mind. Not only a mobile operating system, by connecting the Symetium device via USB 3.0 type C port to an HDMI screen, you can activate a mouse and keyboard friendly PC mode.</p>
<p>Connecting a mouse lets you control the UI using a cursor. Once connected in PC mode the Symetium device can be used as a mouse or keyboard, eliminating the need for external components if none are available. SymetiumOS has been designed to be used in both landscape and portrait modes.</p>
<p>Unlike stock android, Symetium OS will organize apps and files in individual categories – for example, a gallery of pictures, as well as apps relating to pictures. This was done to keep apps and data clean and organized, and to give the user more control the way a PC operating system does.</p>
<p>This makes the app drawer into a file explorer, merging the mobile experience with the PC experience. There is also a native file explorer accessed by pressing the hard drive icon, the same as for a PC operating system. A switch to revert to stock Android is also planned.</p>

<p>No matter what the big
smartphone makers have given us, we here at Symetium have always believed they
could do better. We would envision the improvements, so we were never quite
satisfied with the latest technology. That was when our leader started looking
more closely at his PC. Smartphones are great for on the go, but for big tasks
or even some basic stuff, we still turn to our computers. We started asking why
we couldn’t have a smartphone that offered all of the power, technology, and
efficiency as our computers. This thought is what led us down the long road to
creating the Symetium Smartphone PC – a phone and computer all in one small
handheld device. This truly is a cutting edge state-of-the-art smartphone!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442837683/wlhppfqiskhi3zej0rag.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We’ve set such a high funding goal for a good reason. Between design, certification and manufacture, the costs of building a new phone of this magnitude are huge. But we have our sights set on delivering the ultimate smartphone PC, with zero compromise on functionality, technology, or quality.<br/></p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the estimated use of funds with Production tooling and Manufacture with the highest % allocation. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442837702/chwbhwheyieh22hywaef.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Indiegogo campaign related fees include: 5% IGG platform fees, approx 4% payment processing fees and also campaign marketing and PR related expenses.<br/></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>The challenges and risks that are ahead of us as we finalize the development and delivery of Symetium are related to manufacturing and logistics.</p>
<p>• There may be variations in the colors based on our transition from the prototypes used in the photos and video to the final manufactured product. Some colour options might not be available if demand for the colour is below factory minimum quantities or due to unavailability of material in that colour. </p>
<p>• There may be changes to the final dimensions or specifications of some of the parts as we optimize the design for mass production. </p>
<p>• There is the possibility that the delivery of the product to our contributors may be delayed due to unforeseen product changes that require additional development time or addition to the scope of our manufacturing timeline. </p>
<p>• There is the possibility that the delivery of the product to our contributors may be delayed due to unforeseen circumstances in international shipping and logistics. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, the very nature of Symetium means the exact component list is fluid until we enter production to ensure we’re picking the absolute best available part at the time. If we are forced to change a major feature or component, it will ONLY be because we have come up with something better and more innovative to replace it with. </p>
<p>If there are any changes to Symetium, we will communicate these changes to our contributors in a timely manner.</p>

<p><b>Is the phone locked or unlocked?</b></p>
<p>Symetium is unlocked for use on almost all networks</p>
<p><b>What accessories come as standard?</b></p>
<p>Charger, USB Cable,  Quickstarter Guide, User Manual &amp; Headphones<br/></p>
<p><b>Is there a warranty on Symetium?</b></p>
<p>12 months</p>
<p><b>What is the battery
life?</b></p>
<p>Approximately 3 to 4 days</p>
<p><b>What countries and
mobile networks will support the Symetium?</b></p>
<p>Symetium will work on most GSM &amp; CDMA networks throughout the world.</p>
<p><b>Will the phone receive
updates after launch?</b></p>
<p>Yes, as software evolves, updates will be available as and when necessary.</p>
<p><b>Why set such a high
funding goal?</b></p>
<p>Manufacturing Symetium Smartphones is very costly and we do not want to fall short. We decided that to do things properly and to assure our supporters that they will receive their Symetium, a minimum budget is needed of $1.25M</p>
<p><b>What if you fail to
reach the funding goal?</b></p>
<p>As our  campaign is Fixed Funding, if we do not reach our funding goal all funds will be refunded automatically to all contributors.</p>

Unlike stock android, Symetium OS will organize apps and files in individual categories – for example, a gallery of pictures, as well as apps relating to pictures. This was done to keep apps and data clean and organized, and to give the user more control the way a PC operating system does.
This makes the app drawer into a file explorer, merging the mobile experience with the PC experience. There is also a native file explorer accessed by pressing the hard drive icon, the same as for a PC operating system. A switch to revert to stock Android is also planned.
     







No matter what the big
smartphone makers have given us, we here at Symetium have always believed they
could do better. We would envision the improvements, so we were never quite
satisfied with the latest technology. That was when our leader started looking
more closely at his PC. Smartphones are great for on the go, but for big tasks
or even some basic stuff, we still turn to our computers. We started asking why
we couldn’t have a smartphone that offered all of the power, technology, and
efficiency as our computers. This thought is what led us down the long road to
creating the Symetium Smartphone PC – a phone and computer all in one small
handheld device. This truly is a cutting edge state-of-the-art smartphone!



We’ve set such a high funding goal for a good reason. Between design, certification and manufacture, the costs of building a new phone of this magnitude are huge. But we have our sights set on delivering the ultimate smartphone PC, with zero compromise on functionality, technology, or quality.
Here is a breakdown of the estimated use of funds with Production tooling and Manufacture with the highest % allocation. 

Indiegogo campaign related fees include: 5% IGG platform fees, approx 4% payment processing fees and also campaign marketing and PR related expenses.


The challenges and risks that are ahead of us as we finalize the development and delivery of Symetium are related to manufacturing and logistics.
• There may be variations in the colors based on our transition from the prototypes used in the photos and video to the final manufactured product. Some colour options might not be available if demand for the colour is below factory minimum quantities or due to unavailability of material in that colour. 
• There may be changes to the final dimensions or specifications of some of the parts as we optimize the design for mass production. 
• There is the possibility that the delivery of the product to our contributors may be delayed due to unforeseen product changes that require additional development time or addition to the scope of our manufacturing timeline. 
• There is the possibility that the delivery of the product to our contributors may be delayed due to unforeseen circumstances in international shipping and logistics. 

Finally, the very nature of Symetium means the exact component list is fluid until we enter production to ensure we’re picking the absolute best available part at the time. If we are forced to change a major feature or component, it will ONLY be because we have come up with something better and more innovative to replace it with. 
If there are any changes to Symetium, we will communicate these changes to our contributors in a timely manner.


Is the phone locked or unlocked?
Symetium is unlocked for use on almost all networks
What accessories come as standard?
Charger, USB Cable,  Quickstarter Guide, User Manual & Headphones
Is there a warranty on Symetium?
12 months
What is the battery
life?
Approximately 3 to 4 days
What countries and
mobile networks will support the Symetium?
Symetium will work on most GSM & CDMA networks throughout the world.
Will the phone receive
updates after launch?
Yes, as software evolves, updates will be available as and when necessary.
Why set such a high
funding goal?
Manufacturing Symetium Smartphones is very costly and we do not want to fall short. We decided that to do things properly and to assure our supporters that they will receive their Symetium, a minimum budget is needed of $1.25M
What if you fail to
reach the funding goal?
As our  campaign is Fixed Funding, if we do not reach our funding goal all funds will be refunded automatically to all contributors.

<h3>Some Words About the Team &amp; Why a HiFi Moto Mod</h3>
<p>This project started as a dream from our founder at Orion Tech Mods, many years ago, and the Moto Mods technology is the ideal platform to build that, and we are fortunate to have Arrow Electronics in our team.</p>
<p>Like you, audiophiles and music lovers, we have a personal collection of high-fidelity (HiFi)/high-definition (HiDef) content and feel frustrated to leave all that behind when we are on the go, and lose to the tyranny of MP3 and other low definition and lossy content.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as you might know, HiFi/HiDef content requires special equipment to be listened to (high quality DAC and AMP), and portable devices (smartphones specially) usually require wired (USB) accessories for that purpose.</p>
<p>As many other Moto Z owners, we love the idea of being able to snap specific modules to my phone on the go, with no hassle. And my dream is to have a Moto Mod that is capable of delivering pristine DSD64 content with the good and old headphone jack, without downsampling my music library (DSF, DFF and FLAC lossless content).</p>
<p>So, Motorola, Lenovo and Verizon, in partnership with Indiegogo, have invited developers to submit ideas for Moto Mods as part of the ""transform the smartphone challenge"" (<a href=""https://enterprise.indiegogo.com/motomods/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://enterprise.indiegogo.com/motomods/</a>), to which we were selected as one of the finalists and fortunate to be able to bring that original idea to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>But the electronics need physical stuff to get produced and software to make it run, right? So, prototyping is expensive, specially when we talk about high quality audio components like here. That's why we need your contribution.</p>
<p>Besides your generous open contribution, on the right we are offering other items that are indispensable to every Moto Z owner (and some secret stuff that only the most interested followers will know about). But you can also opt for an Honorable Mention. The decision is yours!</p>
<p>Just in case, if we can't reach the entire goal, don't worry. The money will be still yours. The campaign is set for flexible funding!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As stated by Daniel Guberman, we are trapped in a world of a ""post-fidelity mindset"" (check Ethan Hein's blog post: <a href=""http://www.ethanhein.com/wp/2012/the-post-fidelity-era/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ethanhein.com/wp/2012/the-post-fidel...</a>), with the so-called ""treble culture"", where we have to trade audio quality for convenience and variety.</p>
<p>But it doesn't have to be this way.</p>
<p>Inspired by Motorola's vision for the modular phone (check out this video if you haven't done so yet: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl2Tr5i41rQ)%C2%A0now"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl2Tr5i41rQ)&amp;nb...</a> ), we can start a new era of technology innovation that can bring us back to high-fidelity audio experience (think about Pink Floyd's Immersion box sets here!).</p>
<p>We are not talking about rocket science here, but we need to bring what we have best in technology today to the palm of our hands, and the Moto Mod platform is great for that because we can now plug-and-play our Mods (no rebooting required).</p>
<p>And we are also not talking about one lonely guy in his apartment dreaming about this stuff. I have the great support from the Indiegogo partners (Arrow Electronics' and Analog Devices engineers) and the audiophile community (we just took a nap, industry!), and finally this amazing crowdfunding platform from Indiegogo. Thank you, guys!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>High quality audio requires high quality components and high quality content (think of ""garbage in -&gt; garbage out""), and components require software to run - drivers, to be specific, THE most significant challenge in the development of integrated hardware and software.</p>
<p>Like any other new technology, the Moto Mods platform are still maturing and innovators must come forward to make it happen, and there are risks and challenges to overcome here.</p>
<p>In my IT experience, I've been working with innovation for 19 years, since the down of the consumer Internet.</p>
<p>And one of my goals with this campaign is to open a channel to discuss what high-fidelity audio should look like in this ""post-fidelity world"" where we can't afford the luxury of seating in a couch to listen to great music anymore. We need to build a way to bring back the experience of listening to music, to be able to discover new subtleties and even imperfections recorded in that moment of inspiration of exceptional musicians.</p>

We snap, shoot, like,
follow, and influence  throughout the day, but our day doesn't end when the sun goes down, and neither should our photos or videos. We love our phones, but we wanted something better, something simple, and something that's always within reach.<br/><br/><b>Why it works<br/></b><br/>Panda is based on the traditional lighting tools found on today's film and
television sets. From small eye lights to great big light sources that mimic the
moon, warm, white LED panels provide lighting professionals the light they need
to ensure the perfect shot, every time. And cameras on a complex
film set work just like the ones we carry in our pockets. They use the same type of sensor that's used in your
phone, and that sensor craves light.<b><br/><br/></b>

<p>Your phone's sensor is made up of millions of light-sensitive units
called photosites, but these individual photosites can’t see color – only
luminance (a fancy word for ""light""). To produce a full-color image, each photosite has a
miniature colored filter (red, green or blue) and it's guessing what color to assign to the information the lens is receiving. <br/></p><p>The more information the sensor has, the higher the resolution<i>—</i>so the longer the sensor is
exposed to luminance, the better the picture. <b>A steady light source will always out shine a built
in flash</b>.</p>
<p>But steady light isn't the only trick, quality also matters. Soft diffuse light is always better than harsh, direct light. A light source such as
 a spotlight or flash will either wash out your subject’s features or 
create unflattering and harsh shadows. Diffused light, on the other hand, balances your image and produces smooth, even tones.<br/></p>

<div>We have been making MacBook battery packs since 2009. We start with only the best components (grade A battery cells, industry leading ICs, aerospace grade aluminum), stuff that Apple themselves would use to create HyperJuice, a high power battery pack that can output the same power as the original Apple Power Adapter. Then we use adapters (which we call Magic Boxes) to connect our HyperJuice battery packs to the MacBooks. Magic Boxes for the new 12"" USB-C MacBook are plug &amp; play while Magic Box for the MagSafe MacBooks require a simple 5 minute modification. The end result is a powerful portable power solution that allows you to extend the off-grid usage time of your MacBook.</div>

HyperJuice is the World's ONLY battery pack that can power and charge ALL models of MacBook at the same speed of the original Apple power adapter. Encased in a MacBook matching aluminum enclosure, it also comes with 2 high power USB ports that can charge 2 iPads, iPhones or any USB device at the same time as the MacBook. HyperJuice is the ultimate battery pack for any Apple user.
Works with both USB-C and MagSafe MacBooks!

How it works
Battery + Magic Box = MacBook Charger





We have been making MacBook battery packs since 2009. We start with only the best components (grade A battery cells, industry leading ICs, aerospace grade aluminum), stuff that Apple themselves would use to create HyperJuice, a high power battery pack that can output the same power as the original Apple Power Adapter. Then we use adapters (which we call Magic Boxes) to connect our HyperJuice battery packs to the MacBooks. Magic Boxes for the new 12"" USB-C MacBook are plug & play while Magic Box for the MagSafe MacBooks require a simple 5 minute modification. The end result is a powerful portable power solution that allows you to extend the off-grid usage time of your MacBook.


Features at a glance







4 different capacities (60Wh, 100Wh, 150Wh, 222Wh)
Fast, powerful, efficient & safe charging. Like power from the wall outlet.
Works with ALL MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro Retina models
MacBook matching aerospace grade silver color aluminum enclosure
2 x  12W USB ports to charge 2 x iPads or any USB devices simultaneously
Use Original Magic Box MagSafe adapter to charge MagSafe-based MacBooks
Use Magic Box 29W adapter to charge USB-C MacBooks at full 29W speed
Use Magic Box 12W (with any USB battery) to charge USB-C MacBook at 12W


4 different HyperJuice capacities to choose from  
Our HyperJuice battery packs for MacBook come in 4 capacities of 60Wh, 100Wh, 150Wh and 222Wh, compared to the internal battery capacities of the current MacBook models:  12"" MacBook (29Wh), 11"" MacBook Air (38Wh), 13"" MacBook Air (54Wh), 13"" MacBook Pro (74.9Wh) and 15"" MacBook Pro (99.5Wh). Higher HyperJuice capacities enable the MacBooks to last longer.









Original Magic Box (to charge MagSafe MacBook)




As the magnetic MagSafe connector is patented by Apple and they do not license it out, we created the Magic Box (US Patent US 9,088,090 B2) as a workaround. Magic Box modifies your existing Apple MagSafe Power Adapter to do ALL below:




Charge MacBook with HyperJuice battery packs
Charge MacBook in the car
Retain original usage of Apple MagSafe Power Adapter (to charge  MacBook)
Even use Apple MagSafe Power Adapter to charge HyperJuice battery packs





It only takes 5 mins to DIY (Do-It-Yourself) the Apple MagSafe Adapter (photos/video). OR you can buy an already Modified Apple MagSafe Adapter




Now there's a new 12"" MacBook with USB Type-C 
The latest Apple MacBook now uses a new connector called USB Type-C. USB-C is the latest USB connector that can not only handle data (twice the bandwidth of USB 3.0) but also deliver power up to 100W with advanced features like controlling the direction of power flow (e.g. is the MacBook charging the USB battery or USB battery charging the MacBook?) and intelligent, flexible & optimal power management which are solely lacking in regular USB batteries today.



Ordinary USB batteries may damage new MacBook



Many ""so called USB-C"" battery packs and portable charging solutions today consist of simple wiring that connects the regular old USB port to the new USB-C connector. These solutions are not USB Power Delivery 2.0 compliant, do not interface with the MacBook properly and may damage the MacBook in the long run.

We've not 1 but 2 ways to charge the new MacBook SAFELY, QUICKLY & EFFICIENTLY



HyperJuice has not 1 but 2 USB Power Delivery 2.0 compliant adapters (Magic Boxes) that uses the same USB-C smart microprocessor controller solution as the Apple USB-C Power Adapter.


1) Magic Box 12W (for any USB battery packs)2) Magic Box 29W (for HyperJuice battery packs)



1) Magic Box 12W (for any USB battery packs)World's 1st Smart IC USB to USB Type-C Adapter



Using the same USB-C microprocessor controller solution as the Apple USB-C Power Adapter, Magic Box 12W easily turns any regular USB port to a USB-PD 2.0 compliant USB-C port that can safely charge the new MacBook up to 12W speed.


Magic Box 12W allows ordinary USB batteries to safely charge the new MacBook at up to 12W



2) Magic Box 29W (for HyperJuice battery packs)World's Fastest USB Type-C Portable Charging




If you need faster charging at the same 29W speed as the original Apple USB-C Power Adapter, use Magic Box 29W adapter together with HyperJuice batteries. Only HyperJuice can safely and efficiently provide up to 29W (or even 100W) power via USB-C. This is something that regular USB battery packs cannot do.


Only HyperJuice can charge ALL models of MacBooks (USB-C & MagSafe)

Comes with 2 x 12W high power USB ports so you can charge 2 x iPads & MacBook at the same time!

Design Story & Evolution We started with the most basic and minimalistic design with space just sufficient enough to accommodate a male USB connector (to connect to power/computer), a micro SD slot (the smallest removable memory card for storage) and two female USB ports (one for the iOS/Android device and one for USB storage drive).The basic design is expanded to accommodate the actual final PCB printed circuit board and IC integrated circuit chip. All these while ensuring that one of the surface is a perfect square, a call out to our logo which is made up of 7 perfect squares.The final aesthetic design was to round the corners and add design line elements to the side with female USB ports to give the final look of the HyperCube product.  Proof of working prototypeThe following single shot, unedited video shows a fully functional prototype of the HyperCube. In this video, HyperCube is able to charge the smartphone and automatically start photo/video backup, With HyperCube, the user can browse contents on the attached micro SD memory card as well as the attached USB storage drive, viewing photos/documents, streaming video and audio (including the ability to playback in the background).   Specifications

Takes up the same space as a pack of poker cards.So you can easily fit HyperJuice in any pocket and bring it wherever you go.Built-in foldable wall plugs (no messy bulky power cables)No need to mess with bulky power cables which can be bigger than the charge itself.Travel-friendly pin converters that work in any countryUK, EU, AU pin converters will be providedHyperJuice supports worldwide universal 100-240V voltage and comes with UK/EU/AU pin converters so that it can be used in virtually any country.Powered by the latest Gallium Nitride (GaN) Technology HyperJuice utilizes the industry-leading Navitas GaNFast NV6117 Power IC to miniaturize components normally found in traditional chargers. The new Gallium Nitride semiconductor material allows for power devices that can operate at higher voltages and switching frequency which results in smaller and more efficient chargers. See the following video to learn more about GaN: Sophisticated DesignHYPER has spent almost a year perfecting the circuit design and firmware to fully utilize the Navitas GaNFast NV6117 Power IC to bring the HyperJuice charger to fruition.We want to make the smallest 100W charger ever so the circuit board and components are laid out in the most compact and space-efficient manner. Only the industry's most efficient components that can deliver the best performance in the smallest of space are used. The dense circuit board is then surrounded by high-density thin heat sinks to aid in heat dissipation. The entire package is then wrapped in a minimalist fire-resistant polycarbonate enclosure to complete the efficient design.Industry-Beating Low-Temperature OperationWith so many electronics densely packed in a tiny space, there is a valid concern about heat generation and dissipation in such a small space.So we measured the temperature across 30 points of the HyperJuice charger while it is charging the 15"" MacBook Pro from 0% to 100% battery level. The internal components temperature did not exceed 90ºC while the exterior housing temperature did not exceed 60ºC, beating industry-standards of 130ºC and 65ºC respectively.Click for detailed temperature chartUnparalleled 95% AC/DC Efficiency (vs 91% for Apple/Anker)HyperJuice generates lesser heat than other chargers because it is extremely efficient, around 95% (compared to Apple/Anker chargers with 91% efficiency). As shown in the photo above, with an input power of 106.4W, HyperJuice is able to output 100.72W (20.149*4.999). 100.72W/106.4W = 95%.See video below: Proof of Concept VideoThe following single shot unedited video shows a full working prototype of the HyperJuice 100W GaN Charger able to output 100W power to a 15"" MacBook Pro. In addition, it is able to charge another 15"" MacBook Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, and Apple Watch ( a total of 4 devices) all at the same time. Power meter showing that HyperJuice 100W GaN Charger is providing 19.72V x 5.07A = 99.98W of power to HyperJuice USB-C Battery Pack. See video below:Hands-on test by 9to5mac.com Up to 50% smaller than all other similar power chargersWith more power, ports, features, and efficiencyProduct ComparisonWorks with the new Apple 16"" MacBook ProHyperJuice is able to power the latest 16"" MacBook Pro at the maximum 100W power.Smaller than Anker 100W and More ports than Apple 96WAnker 100W (Left) vs HyperJuice 100W (Center) vs Apple 96W (Right)Anker 100W (Left) vs HyperJuice 100W (Center) vs Apple 96W (Right)Anker 100W (Left) vs HyperJuice 100W (Center) vs Apple 96W (Right)Product Specifications

Pocket’s exquisite and small appearance can be comparable to the MacBook Air. With the same configuration (4GB/128GB), Pocket uses active cooling design which means that the performance will be far beyond the Microsoft Surface 3 while the weight is much lighter than the latter. Through the HDMI HD cable, it can connect to any display to become a PC computer so as to exploit the performance to the maximum. The new Type C interface can be infinitely expanded with peripherals. At the same time, it is the world's first pocket laptop with 7-inch screen to support 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Of course we will also provide Windows 10 firmware which meets the needs of Windows users.If you want, you can access mobile network anytime and anywhere through an external 4G network interface card with a USB port without opening the phone hot spots. Even if you forget to bring a mobile phone, you can communicate with any corner of the world through the Skype Internet phone, which is so cool!Our obsession with smart portable devices is no less than that of any geek. That's why we're developing this ultra-compact laptop. With your laptop in your pocket, you can do things that must be done with your desktop and connect the monitor to the laptop as a host.Pocket is the leader and practitioner for the next generation of laptop. Our ultimate goal is to put the laptop in the pocket.

Note: Specifications may change.This pocket laptop adopts pure silver CNC precise all-in-one body made of magnesium and alloy, which means that its craftsmanship can be comparable to the MacBook Air. Because of its portability, we believe it will become the first choice for fashion women.Imagine a scene where a fashionable woman takes a 7-inch laptop from her shoulder bag with a cup of coffee placing next to her. She drinks coffee while gracefully typing the text on her keyboard to chat with the girlfriends. I believe a lot of fashionable women will be crazy to have such a pocket laptop. Otherwise, she needs to carry a bulky MacBook Air.A Linux engineer drinks coffee while opening Vim to program scripts with Pocket. Isn’t it all fashionable people’s dream?As we all know, higher resolution will bring richer colors and fineness. Pocket with more than 300PPI pixel density has been beyond the ""retina"" level screen proposed by Apple.For portability, performance and heat dissipation, we choose the currently most top-class Intel x7-Z8750 with 4-core 4-thread design and 8GB LPDDR 3 RAM, 128GB eMMC and 7000mAh polymer lithium battery. It has 12-hour battery life, built-in copper radiator pipe and large-diameter heat output pipeline. It increases the fan’s driving-power so that the body is always maintained blow 38℃ acceptable for the human body. Due to the active cooling, its performance is much better than that of Surface 3.Pocket has a Type C interface which provides the body with power supply. In fact, Type C interface’s expandable peripherals are very rich. The peripherals can not only transmit data in high speed but also output audio and video. To achieve that, only a Type C to HDMI or Type C to DisplayPort data cable or a headset based on the Type C interface is needed. Theoretically, the transmission speed of Type C is up to 5.0Gbps (500MB/s). At the same time, Pocket also provides a USB Type A interface. You can connect to any USB-based peripherals such as printer, USB flash disk, USB Hub, scanner, speaker, and wireless keyboard. Of course, you can also output high-definition videos in the Pocket to the TV through the HDMI D Type interface.Don't worry about the limited ports, you can use the Type C Hub to connect many external devices such as network cable,TF card,mouse,keyboard,projector and U disk,etc. What is more, you can also use them when charging this device.As for input, Combined with ergonomics. Our design adopts the chocolate keyboard (plane island keyboard) that has won the highest award of the 2009 German Red Dot Award. Increase the contact area of finger and keycap. This leads to more accurate keystroke and more comfortable keyboard input than that of Surface 3. So it is very suitable for woman’s delicate fingers. At the same time, non-adhesive design also Reduce the rate of wrong input. Compared with a traditional keyboard, both the key process and key spacing of Pocket are significantly improved, increasing the comfort of operations.In order to meet the needs of Linux and Windows users, in the system selection, Pocket will provide Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Windows 10 Home.As the ""kindest"" and most popular Linux system, Ubuntu can shoulder a responsibility. Ubuntu can achieve all the features on Windows. The open-source LibreOffice office suite provides the most popular software similar to Word, Excel and Power Print on Microsoft Office. And you do not have to pay a penny for it. Not only that, Steam platform has a client for Ubuntu. That is to say you can download and play Steam games on Ubuntu. You can even use Chrome for Ubuntu to play Android games. As long as you like, there is no function Ubuntu cannot achieve. Pocket's portability makes work anytime and anywhere possible.As a software developer, I believe no one will deny that the Shell of Linux is N times better than that of Windows. The shell of Linux and text editor Vim are universal development tools. No matter what is to be developed, it will be used to avoid the cost of learning a variety of IDEs. And many tools can only run on Unix-like systems (Linux and OS X), for example, Spark, Hadoop and Web framework Meteor that are used for distributed data analysis and cannot be installed on Windows, let alone be developed. This is also the main reason why many programmers develop on Linux. Pocket supporting Ubuntu is to make it easier for programmers anytime and anywhere to program.BackTrack 5r3, Nodezero, BackBox Linux, Blackbuntu, Knoppix STD and other systems, as Linuxes used by white hat hackers for penetration testing, are the most popular and well-known hacker release versions based on Ubuntu. This means that Pocket supports Ubuntu. And at the same time, it may also support these hacker systems. After all, these systems are based on Ubuntu. And the drive of Ubuntu can also be applied to these systems.We successfully launched GPD WIN handheld device. At the same time, we were confident to run Windows 10 system on Pocket. In fact, we believe that user groups of Windows prefer such a pocket-type laptop. In the field of light office such as securities trading, table editing, text composition, PPT design and presentation as well as sending e-mail, high performance isn’t needed. Just with an external TV or monitor, Pocket can bring an excellent user experience.In order to achieve such a product with appearance more beautiful than that of MacBook, performance better than Surface 3 and portability as a mobile phone, we have gone through nearly a year of creation and design. Only we ourselves can understand the painstaking. From the earliest concept and creative sketch design to the 3D printer model and structural design, until today, the prototype has been basically completed. We have paid a huge cost.The reason why we raise funds in the Indiegogo is that the Pocket’s mould, research and development as well as components procurement costs are expensive. All the funds we raise will be directly used for this product’s mass production. We believe that such a product will touch all geeks who like portable devices. We really hope that you will support this project. For Pocket, let us work together!We are a company focusing on the development of game hardware in Shenzhen, China. GPD is our brand. Its full name is GamePad Digital. We once tried to build a piece of hardware perfectly compatible with major game platforms. Then we introduced GPD XD, which was very successful and received positive evaluation of game players who like PSP, NDS and arcade games.Later, we found that the handheld game console market based on Windows turned out to be blank and the global annual production of PC games was large. If players can play PC games on a Windows-based handheld game console, they will get a whole new experience. Based on this, we launched the GPD WIN at the end of last year. This handheld game console is successful. Though it is not perfect, the success of WIN gives us confidence to launch its upgrades.But WIN is not suitable for light office users who are not interested in games. This part of the users covers fashionable women, geeks and successful people. On the contrary, they have a broad appeal for a product similar to the MacBook Air. And we focus on providing personalized products for different user groups.

 Grips are removable to work with other iPad Pro cases or devices Worldwide Patent Pending$1M Stretch Goal: USB-C Extension CableReplace all other dongles with HyperDrive Compared to other dongles in the market and from the Apple Store, HyperDrive is more portable, has more features and is made of better materials. You would need multiple dongles to achieve what HyperDrive does, at a total cost much higher than HyperDrive.Stop figuring out how to store and carry your donglesHaving multiple dongles means that you now have more items to manage on top of your iPad Pro, which increases the risk of misplacing them as you move around.With HyperDrive, just pack and goHyperDrive is designed to be compact enough to stay with your iPad Pro wherever you go.Don't look silly with dongles. Just go with HyperDrive!Stop hanging and juggling with multiple dongles. A single compact HyperDrive does the job of multiple dongles. Dongles never look sleeker than this.Precision milled aluminum enclosure color matched to Silver and Space Gray iPad ProPerfectly color matched to Space Gray and Silver iPad ProThe same HyperDrive works with both 11"" and 12.9"" iPad ProDesignWe wanted HyperDrive to feel like a natural extension of the 2018 iPad Pro with similar product lines, thickness, right angled edges and rounded corners.As the 2018 iPad Pro only has a single USB-C port for the HyperDrive to latch on, we had to come up with an innovative solution to secure HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro.The end result is a sleek, minimalist design that perfectly matches the 2018 iPad Pro with almost the same thickness, with removable soft grips that secures the HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro without interfering with its or the Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio functionality.

We also designed a unique circular space saving 5 stage LED battery level indicator that lies symmetrically with the power button, just like the ports.Power to charge a MacBook Pro, iPad & iPhone at the same time!Power a 15"" MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and iPhone at the same time! HyperJuice - Designed to be the Most Powerful USB-C BatteryHyperJuice - The Most Powerful USB-C Battery Pack Demonstration of Working Prototype We recently demonstrated a working prototype of the HyperJuice at the recent IFA Berlin 2018 trade show where the following  video was shot.The following one shot unedited video demonstrates a fully functional pre-production HyperJuice with all charging ports working. The 100W USB-C port is shown to charge a 2018 MacBook Pro 15"" at 100W. The 60W USB-C port is shown to charge a 2018 MacBook Pro 13"" at 60W while the 18W USB-A port is shown to simultaneously charge a iPhone X at the same time. Pass through charging is also demonstrated. While HyperJuice is being recharged via its 100W USB-C input port, the HyperJuice is able to charge the 2018 MacBook Pro 13"" and iPhone X at the same time via the 60W USB-C output port and 18W USB-A port respectively. Expected Retail Price

<h2>What is iPin?</h2>
<p><b>Short Answer: </b><br/>iPin is a super cool gadget that turns your iPhone or Android phone into a laser pointer (and wireless presenter).</p>

It is so small, it fits almost completely inside the headphone minijack. Together with the free iPin app, you can wirelessly control presentation slides on your computer right from your phone. No more fumbling for the misplaced laser pointer, wireless presenter and batteries. iPin is the only laser presenter you ever need and it is always by your side, on your phone.<br/></p>

What is iPin?
Short Answer: iPin is a super cool gadget that turns your iPhone or Android phone into a laser pointer (and wireless presenter).

It's so cool that even Steve Wozniak (co-founder of Apple) carries one by his side.

Source: Business Value (China Edition) March 5, 2014 Page 14.Long Answer:The original iPin is the world's smallest laser presenter for the iPhone (it works with iPad and iPod touch as well). It is so small, it fits almost completely inside the headphone minijack. Together with the free iPin app, you can wirelessly control presentation slides on your computer right from your phone. No more fumbling for the misplaced laser pointer, wireless presenter and batteries. iPin is the only laser presenter you ever need and it is always by your side, on your phone.




Here's a serious video about iPin...
But be sure to check out the funny version at the top of this page first!


iPin turns our hero Pete (and you) into the King of Presentations
Now you can fire lasers and magically control any iPad, Mac or PC!


Now see real life Pete use the iPin...

FREE iPin app



There's an iPin for Android too!



iPin for Android works with almost any Android device with a micro USB port. Together with the free Android app downloadable from the Google Play Store, you now have all the iPin laser pointer and wireless presenter features on an Android.

One more thing...It's really easy...
to use iPin by itself to wirelessly control presentations on Mac/PC computers BUT if you are lazy like Pete or just simply don't want to deal with WiFi connections or installing host programs on computers, you would then use BTtogo.


BTtogo allows you to control any public computer with virtually zero setup even if there are security firewalls


While iPin for iOS/Android alone can perform wireless presentations, some setup is required on the host computer and all devices need to be on the same WiFi network.
BTtogo makes it easier for performing wireless presentations anytime, anywhere, on any public computer, even when there are security firewalls and no WiFi. It's plug-and-play with virtually zero setup.

Works in conjunction with iPin for iOS/Android
Works with any public Mac and PC computer
Bluetooth connection. No WiFi required.
Store your presentation files on a micro SD memory card (not included)
Insert micro SD into BTtogo which then connects to computer via USB
Plug-and-play. Virtually zero setup on host computer.
No host program required
Works even with security firewalls
No need to transfer presentation files to computer
USB bus powered. No batteries required.

Don't trust Pete? Trust Woz then!
Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer and inventor of the Apple I and Apple II, counts on Teslas, Segways, Nixie Watches, not 1 but 3 iPhones and the iPin Laser Presenter amongst his daily arsenal of gadgets.

Still need some convincing?

No copycats.


Fun things you can do with the iPin

#1 Be a Force to be reckon with

#2 Be helpful to others

#3 Play with pets

Direct pets AWAY from traffic NOT towards traffic. 
#4 See how laser guided missiles work



Ok iPin doesn't divert laser guided missiles, just like energy drinks don't make you grow wings!
Time for Pete to get out...

And I want something that respects my privacy. What I want could be built from existing bricks in a reasonable amount of time and it would come along with nice online tools such as office, cloud storage and email services.  This ""new thing"" will be - as much as possible - open source. And for me and others to enjoy using it, it needs to be attractively designed.At its foundation, it will be forked from LineageOS which is open source and can run mainstream Android applications. On top of that will be layered great open source modules to form a consistent mobile and web system.I've called the project ""eelo” because eels are small fishes that can hide in the sea. That’s perfect for my quest for more privacy. And we have a nice logo:    I want eelo to be a non-profit project, a project “in the public interest”. I strongly believe operating systems and web services should be a shared resource: as I explained a few years ago, they are infrastructure - just like phone networks, rail tracks, and roads.Non-profit doesn’t mean nothing will be for sale. We envisage selling preloaded eelo smartphones, and providing premium services for corporates. But profit won’t be eelo's primary focus.And as a community project, eelo will welcome contributors.  The eelo project will release attractive-designed ""privacy-enabled"" smartphone ROMs and smartphones for the average user, with associated web-services.Our first positive results at proof-of-concept stage are  described on this page.First eelo prototype smartphone OSWe have also started to review alternative web-services that would be compatible with the eelo project and that we would be able to customize and integrate with the eelo mobile operating system. eelo vision: devices and web services with privacy respect  We need to bootstrap the project and pay developers for initial development work to reach a first viable ""privacy-enabled"" eelo product that users will be able to install on their own phones or order on quantity-limited pre-installed eelo smartphones.This functioning product would include:- a mobile operating system with new default applications and new user interface- integrated basic web services (search, cloud storage, settings recovery)- updates for 3 years or more, with full respect of user privacy. Then we will be able to attract more contributors and the project will become naturally sustainable as it iterates to new releases.  Between 5% to 10% will go to Indiegogo (service fee & financial fees), 60% will be used to pay the development team for a few months until we reach the first minimum viable product, and to pay servers. The remaining 30% will pay all the goodies and services that we offer in return for the user's contributions. Note: 20% VAT may be deducted from the real amount of available money.- If we reach 100 000 € / $120 000 or more, we'll be able to put more effort into the development team and reach our goal more quickly, and with more first-release features.- If we reach 500 000 € / $600 000 more, we'll be able to hire more people and set up a full non-profit organization that will be fully operating before the end of 2018. We'll also start to develop a Linux-based eelo operating system for PCs.- If we reach 1 000 000€ / $1 200 000 or more, we'll be able to do all the above plus quickly gain the status of ""organization in the public interest"". This status will help to attract more money to fuel the project as donations from institutions, states, corporates and individuals will allow some fiscal benefits for donators.- If we reach 2 000 000€ / $2 400 000 or more, we'll be able to design and release our own eelo smartphone by partnering with a hardware maker, and launch new projects such as a ""voice pod"" home assistant.And we'll get a great bezel-less eelo smartphone. Gaël Duval is the project founder, and lives in Europe. Gaël is an open source advocate and has created two significant open source products: the Mandrake Linux distribution and Ulteo, an application and desktop delivery platform. Hathibelagal Ashraff is eelo's lead developer, and lives in India. Hathibelagal is a programmer, writer, and inventor. His interests include mobile app and ROM development, machine learning, and data mining. Rhandros Dembicky is eelo's artist in chief, and lives in Brazil. Rhandros is a UI/UX Designer with a solid background in mobile products. For more than 10 years he has worked with big players in the market creating digital products such as PlayKids, one of the world's most famous apps in the kids category.Véronique Loquet is eelo's head of communication and she lives in Europe. For twenty years Véronique has been helping hackers and IT doers in the open source and security fields to organize their media relations and events, all over the world.And we're helped by several advisors on various aspects of the project. We think that eelo can have a global, worldwide impact as a major open source project in the public interest. It will help freeing users from personal data spying and advertising. eelo is about freedom and privacy in the digital world.Contributing to this crowdfunding campaign is a great way to support eelo's first stages of development. You are encouraged to share this campaign as much as possible, to friends, on internet forums and on social medias.You can also register at our website or contact us as a potential contributor. We'll need engineers, testers, translators, and people who can spread the word everywhere.Find more information about eelo and ways to contact us at eelo.io By contributing to the eelo crowdfunding campaign, you help fuel early development and increase our chances of releasing software and services that will be made available to all. The biggest reward for all of us is the benefits the eelo project can bring to the world. But at the same time we have worked on some cool rewards. Depending on your level of commitment, you'll get stickers, t-shirts, and as a eelo official community member, you will be better connected to us and we'll listen to your voice carefully. Last but not least, there will be a few early ""eelo smartphones"" available for the biggest contributors!  Since the beginning of the eelo campaign, we have received an awesome amount of support from people who like the project and who want to contribute. We also started to get some media coverage! We hope to soon be in the Washington Post, Elle and Vanity Fair, but meanwhile you can find us on a number of IT news sites, including ZDNet, Wired.it, Slashdot, HackerNoon and AndroidHeadlines.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

Easily switch from indoor to outdoor, from the office to the coffee shop, without having to carry multiple chargers.Image that you’re packing for a business trip. To power a laptop, you need to carry a wall charger. To power your phone on the go, you need a power bank. But packing both can feel like overkill. MIX GO combines both functions into a single space-saving device. And with 45W PD output in charger mode and 5,000mAh in power bank mode, nothing is compromised. ""This has now become my daily-carry battery and my daily carry adapter."" - Tech Craft on YouTube""...far more practical than Apple's own included adapter."" - Andrew O'Hara, AppleInsider MIX GO supports up to 45W with USB-C PD (Power Delivery), which means it can quickly charge most USB-C laptops, and it can charge your MacBook or MacBook Air at full speed.Simultaneous High-Speed Charging for MacBook 12” and iPad.MIX GO also can charge iPhone 11 / 11 Pro / XS / XR / X / 8 up to 50% in just 30 minutes with a USB-C to Lightning cable, and fully charge a Nintendo Switch in just 2.8 hours.Major advancements are coming to the field of electronics thanks to GaN (Gallium Nitride), a semiconductor material with specific benefits over its predecessors in certain applications. In power converters, GaN semiconductors run at a higher efficiency, produce less heat, and tolerate higher current compared to traditional silicon-based approaches.With GaN technology, now MIX GO can provide 45W of power in a smaller form factor, with a cooler operating temperature and higher efficiency.Do you ever worry about your phone running out of juice?  MIX GO’s 5,000mAh capacity can extend phone usage time by up to 20 hours. A full day’s charge is at your fingertips. With ZEN+ Adaptive Charging technology, MIX GO supports up to 15W power output in battery mode, automatically detecting your device and fine-tuning the output. ZEN+ makes MIX GO compatible with Apple smartphones, Android smartphones, tablets and many other electronic devices.Time for bed. Better plug in your phone, your laptop, and your power bank. But do you have enough USB ports to do all of that? MIX GO features pass-through charging technology, so you can rest easy. Plug MIX GO into the wall, and connect your phone and laptop into MIX GO. Your new favorite charger will handle the rest.At Zendure, we’re all about the user. The power connector folds in for easy storage. The ridged design makes MIX GO easy to grip and plug into the wall. GaN technology allows MIX GO to be smaller than other laptop chargers, and the high-density internal power cell means allows us to pack a substantial amount of juice in there as well. Whether in a suitcase, a bag, or even your pocket, MIX GO was made for travel.With a foldable and switchable EU / UK plug adapter (in our Global version), you can travel to over 100 countries and regions with MIX GO worry-free. You can also select an AU plug for MIX GO, available as an add-on.After tirelessly iterating on the design, we are pleased to announce that we have already begun trial production.

<div>
<b><h1></h1></b><p>No project is without their risk and challenges but we try to do our absolute best to minimize them. We felt that we have done all the necessary preliminary work prior to coming to Indiegogo. We are no strangers to battery packs, mobile accessories or even Crowdfunding. Having previously done 2 successful Kickstarter projects “CloudFTP” and “iStick”, each with their unique challenges, we have gathered a lot of experience and learnt a lot to make this Indiegogo project even better. That said, we identify the following as our risks and challenges:</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING: The product shown above is a fully functional prototype. We are currently making the final pre-production model which will be ready around Nov 17. The final pre-production model is the model that will be eventually produced and will incorporate improvements such as brighter, more consistent LED ring light, reinforced hinges amongst other improvements. If the final pre-production model fail to meet our high standards, we might not be able to meet the early bird Christmas shipping deadline. However we never had a battery pack product fail at this stage before and initial reports looks very promising. In any case, we will inform funders of any manufacturing or shipping delays before the project funding ends so funders can decide if they want to wait or not.</p>
<p>FULFILLMENT: While we anticipate no issue with shipping the product in January, delivering the early bird products in the US before Christmas is a small challenge which requires careful coordination, planning and execution. The goods will be delivered via US Postal Service and the deadline for Christmas mailing is December 20. Our plan is to ship out on December 15 to give ourselves some buffer.</p>
<p>SHIPPING TO INTERNATIONAL FUNDERS: We have been shipping batteries internationally, as well as domestically, for several years. There have been recent changes in shipping regulations surrounding lithium cell batteries (and we except more will come). We will work closely with our shipping provider to ensure that all our funders receive their Pearl in a safe and timely manner.</p>
<p>In order to live up to the expectations that we have set for Pearl, we have implemented a strict timeline with our manufacturer. We understand that Indiegogo funders want their Pearl as soon as possible, but we also want the Pearl to be of highest quality and up to our desired specifications.  </p>
<p>We are dedicated to our project timeline and will keep you informed on the status of our progress on a regular basis via updates.</p>

Specifications  Who are we? HYPER by Sanho Corporation has been making high end battery packs since 2009. Our first battery pack product is the World's first and only external battery pack for the Apple MacBook, which has won many awards including Best of Macworld Show and MacObserver Editor's Choice. Our battery packs are also the only battery packs certified by FAA for use for all stages of flight and we are the official battery pack supplier for various airlines like American Airlines, British Airways, Singapore Airlines, Qantas for their iPad Electronic Flight Bag.This is our 1st Indiegogo but our 3rd Crowdfunding project. Our most recent Kickstarter project, iStick, raised over $1.1 million in funding. Our first Kickstarter project, CloudFTP was the 3rd highest funded Kickstarter technology project when funding ended and named by Stuff Magazine as one of the “10 best Kickstarter technology projects”. We are also the technology provider for another successful Kickstarter project called CameraMator.DesignThe concept is simple. To reinvent the traditional compact mirror by adding a thin high capacity 3000mAh battery, advanced circuitry and cool features like 3X magnification mirror, LED ring light, LED battery inndicator lights and magnetic closure, all without significantly increasing the weight and bulk of the humble compact mirror. Risks and Challenges:

No project is without their risk and challenges but we try to do our absolute best to minimize them. We felt that we have done all the necessary preliminary work prior to coming to Indiegogo. We are no strangers to battery packs, mobile accessories or even Crowdfunding. Having previously done 2 successful Kickstarter projects “CloudFTP” and “iStick”, each with their unique challenges, we have gathered a lot of experience and learnt a lot to make this Indiegogo project even better. That said, we identify the following as our risks and challenges:
MANUFACTURING: The product shown above is a fully functional prototype. We are currently making the final pre-production model which will be ready around Nov 17. The final pre-production model is the model that will be eventually produced and will incorporate improvements such as brighter, more consistent LED ring light, reinforced hinges amongst other improvements. If the final pre-production model fail to meet our high standards, we might not be able to meet the early bird Christmas shipping deadline. However we never had a battery pack product fail at this stage before and initial reports looks very promising. In any case, we will inform funders of any manufacturing or shipping delays before the project funding ends so funders can decide if they want to wait or not.
FULFILLMENT: While we anticipate no issue with shipping the product in January, delivering the early bird products in the US before Christmas is a small challenge which requires careful coordination, planning and execution. The goods will be delivered via US Postal Service and the deadline for Christmas mailing is December 20. Our plan is to ship out on December 15 to give ourselves some buffer.
SHIPPING TO INTERNATIONAL FUNDERS: We have been shipping batteries internationally, as well as domestically, for several years. There have been recent changes in shipping regulations surrounding lithium cell batteries (and we except more will come). We will work closely with our shipping provider to ensure that all our funders receive their Pearl in a safe and timely manner.
In order to live up to the expectations that we have set for Pearl, we have implemented a strict timeline with our manufacturer. We understand that Indiegogo funders want their Pearl as soon as possible, but we also want the Pearl to be of highest quality and up to our desired specifications.  
We are dedicated to our project timeline and will keep you informed on the status of our progress on a regular basis via updates.",27.0,0,"18 Campaigns

<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>In order to simplify Indiegogo reward fulfillment so that we can get all the chargers out to everyone as soon as possible, we are only offering the charger in a special Indiegogo edition <strong>BLACK</strong> color (see photos below). We love Black and many backers have asked for Black for our previous project because Black color is more stain-resistant in the long run. White color chargers are for illustrative purposes and may be offered later at retail after fulfillment for Indiegogo is completed. Please understand that having multiple color choices, especially for different chargers within the same reward will just complicate and delay the entire Indiegogo fulfillment process. For example, we won't be able to ask for your color choices until after the project ends via a survey which means we cannot accurately prepare the rewards beforehand.</p>

<p>HYPER by Sanho Corporation has been making award-winning USB-C products since 2015. We also have a long proven track record of delivering Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects. Our most successful Kickstarter and Indiegogo project, HyperDrive USB-C Hub for MacBook Pro, raised over $3.1 million and is currently the most crowdfunded MacBook and USB-C accessory. Our latest Kickstarter and Indiegogo, HyperJuice 100W GaN Charger, which raised over $3.3 million is the most crowdfunded USB-C charger. The HyperJuice 130W USB-C Battery Pack is the most crowdfunded power bank project on Kickstarter ($1.4M). Our HyperDrive USB-C Hub for iPad Pro is the most crowdfunded iPad accessory ($1.2M) and many more. So we do have a lot of experience with USB-C and Apple products. This is our 26th crowdfunding project. Our previous crowdfunding projects have altogether raised over $14 million and we have delivered to over 140,000 backers.</p>
</div></div>","Please Note That

For Indiegogo, we are only offering the charger in a special Indiegogo edition BLACK color (see photos under Rewards section below). White color chargers are for illustrative purposes and may be offered later at retail after fulfillment for Indiegogo is completed.
We will only be shipping rewards to USA/Canada addresses for this project. We will not offer International (outside USA/Canada) shipping for this project due to unpredictable postal shipping times and costs as a result of COVID-19.
We do not recommend using plug adapters for this charger as plug adapters are generally not rated for 1500W pass-through power and will not support the stacking ability of this charger. As such, we will also not be offering any plug adapters for this charger. This further reinforces our decision not to offer International shipping.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused to our international backers. As an alternative solution, you can get our bestselling, most crowdfunded 100W GaN Charger with free International plug adapters for 30% off here (discount applied at checkout) which will more than enough pay for any courier express shipping that is less affected by COVID-19 restrictions. The promo expires on 12/31/2020.

Rewards
In order to simplify Indiegogo reward fulfillment so that we can get all the chargers out to everyone as soon as possible, we are only offering the charger in a special Indiegogo edition BLACK color (see photos below). We love Black and many backers have asked for Black for our previous project because Black color is more stain-resistant in the long run. White color chargers are for illustrative purposes and may be offered later at retail after fulfillment for Indiegogo is completed. Please understand that having multiple color choices, especially for different chargers within the same reward will just complicate and delay the entire Indiegogo fulfillment process. For example, we won't be able to ask for your color choices until after the project ends via a survey which means we cannot accurately prepare the rewards beforehand.

<p>Stabilizing laser light in dynamic working environment is a challenge, especially when stored in a tiny space lacking heat dissipater. A common way of dissipating heat is to connect laser to a bulky circuit.

The mini laser smartly stabilizes light power by itself and is more compact than those used in an ultra slim DVD drive.</p>

It’s a powerful and convenient device for people on the go. And looking at the specs, there’s really no better companion for the new iPad Pro than <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zendure/superhub-card-sized-charging-data-and-video-hub-with-dual-pd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SuperHub</a>.</p><h2>Charge Faster</h2><p>The new iPad Pro has a maximum charging speed of 30W, but the power adapter included with iPad Pro only offers 18W. SuperHub can deliver 30W, meaning it can charge the new iPad Pro in almost half the time compared to the included charger. That’s less time tethered to a wall outlet and more time being productive… or just having fun.</p><div data-id=""28485245""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1585763930/s648ks0us76psnjjezhp.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h2> </h2><h2>Get More Done</h2><p>On top of that, SuperHub expands the capabilities of the new iPad Pro’s Magic Keyboard. iPad Pro has a USB-C port that can be connected to SuperHub to take advantage of hub capabilities, so you can pass-through charge another USB-C device and connect a USB-A device as well.</p><div data-id=""28485251""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1585763930/wkaqodutiwgvfvntglev.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h2>A New Perspective</h2><p>One more thing!

A laptop power brick takes up so much space, but it only does one thing. Sure, we could add more ports to it, but there had to be more. So we began looking at the sort of “everyday carry” situation for people who are most impacted by this unitasking brick: heavy on-the-go laptop users. We wanted to see what kinds of devices and accessories were essential for these users, and figure out if we could deliver a better solution.</p><p>That was back in 2018. We spoke with daily laptop users to get an idea of the feature set that would be most useful to them. Then we got to work on figuring out how to deliver that. We knew pretty early on that we’d need to use GaN (gallium nitride) technology to boost SuperHub’s efficiency and make the device as small as possible.</p><p>SuperHub uses Power Integrations PowiGaN Technology SC1933C power IC. PowiGaN is Power Integrations’ internally developed gallium nitride (GaN) technology. PowiGaN switches replace the traditional silicon transistors on the primary side of PI’s highly integrated offline flyback switcher ICs, reducing switching losses and enabling chargers, adapters and open frame power supplies that are more efficient, smaller and lighter than silicon alternatives.</p><div data-id=""28157690""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1585763956/kqxyefuy16ayvoftlslu.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Then we started working on mechanical and electronic prototypes, focusing on core functions as well as overall design and user experience. Every aspect of the product, from its dimensions and slip-resistant feet to the spacing between the ridges and the “D” logo status light, have been fine-tuned so we could create a product that is both useful and attractive.</p><div data-id=""28157834""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1585763957/kx98nukizcds8qnbm7jo.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Two years of ideation, consultation, and iteration has brought us to SuperHub, a multi-port power supply, USB hub, and HDMI converter that could hide under a credit card.

It’s a powerful and convenient device for people on the go. And looking at the specs, there’s really no better companion for the new iPad Pro than SuperHub.Charge FasterThe new iPad Pro has a maximum charging speed of 30W, but the power adapter included with iPad Pro only offers 18W. SuperHub can deliver 30W, meaning it can charge the new iPad Pro in almost half the time compared to the included charger. That’s less time tethered to a wall outlet and more time being productive… or just having fun. Get More DoneOn top of that, SuperHub expands the capabilities of the new iPad Pro’s Magic Keyboard. iPad Pro has a USB-C port that can be connected to SuperHub to take advantage of hub capabilities, so you can pass-through charge another USB-C device and connect a USB-A device as well.A New PerspectiveOne more thing! Want to hook up an external display? SuperHub’s HDMI port delivers 4K@60Hz video, for twice the resolution and detail compared to 1080p.Do you know someone who’s got an eye on the new iPad Pro from Apple?

SuperHub provides 18W Power Delivery for another phone and a USB-A port to work as a hub if you need.How Does SuperHub Work with Nintendo SwitchSuperHub provides 30W Power Delivery to charge your Switch at full speed. At the same time, enjoy a 4K resolution through TV mode display!SuperHub’s three USB ports can power up to three devices simultaneously, from tablets and smartphones to cameras and wearables.

DeX / PC Mode: Turn Your Samsung Galaxy S20 into a Laptop You know those days when you need your laptop but you don’t need your laptop? If your phone supports DeX/PC mode, you can use SuperHub to connect your phone to an external display and keyboard. This feature is compatible with the latest Samsung S20. Leave the laptop at home if it’s not sparking joy today.
 Note: This feature is compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10/S20, Note 10/10+ for USB PD charging and DeX mode, Huawei P20/P30, Mate 10/20/30 series for USB PD charging and PC mode.SuperHub supports two working modes--desktop mode and wall charger mode--to adapt to your needs in any situation.Here is a partial list of devices compatible with SuperHub. How Does SuperHub Work?   ""SuperHub is an absolutely great piece of tech to have on hand. For the vast majority of users, it has everything they need."" ——Andrew O'Hara, -- AppleInsider.com ""...the Zendure SuperHub might be the only power hub you could need."" - ZDNet.com ""If you're looking for a way to consolidate your accessories into a smaller package, then I don't think you'll regret picking up one of the SuperHub.""- Tech Craft Something has been bugging us for a while. A laptop power brick takes up so much space, but it only does one thing. Sure, we could add more ports to it, but there had to be more. So we began looking at the sort of “everyday carry” situation for people who are most impacted by this unitasking brick: heavy on-the-go laptop users. We wanted to see what kinds of devices and accessories were essential for these users, and figure out if we could deliver a better solution.That was back in 2018. We spoke with daily laptop users to get an idea of the feature set that would be most useful to them. Then we got to work on figuring out how to deliver that. We knew pretty early on that we’d need to use GaN (gallium nitride) technology to boost SuperHub’s efficiency and make the device as small as possible.SuperHub uses Power Integrations PowiGaN Technology SC1933C power IC. PowiGaN is Power Integrations’ internally developed gallium nitride (GaN) technology. PowiGaN switches replace the traditional silicon transistors on the primary side of PI’s highly integrated offline flyback switcher ICs, reducing switching losses and enabling chargers, adapters and open frame power supplies that are more efficient, smaller and lighter than silicon alternatives.Then we started working on mechanical and electronic prototypes, focusing on core functions as well as overall design and user experience. Every aspect of the product, from its dimensions and slip-resistant feet to the spacing between the ridges and the “D” logo status light, have been fine-tuned so we could create a product that is both useful and attractive.Two years of ideation, consultation, and iteration has brought us to SuperHub, a multi-port power supply, USB hub, and HDMI converter that could hide under a credit card. A product that most users would be happy to carry in place of their laptop’s power brick.We’ve been eagerly anticipating the launch of SuperHub, and we don’t intend to keep you waiting too long to get your hands on it. We’ve already gone into trial production, which allows us to identify areas for improvement before mass production begins. Those improvements are nearly complete, and we are on track to deliver the earliest reward in May of this year.To clarify, SuperHub are available with two versions, the NS Edition and the standard version. Please note, the standard version doesn't support Switch in TV mode. Below is the detail comparison of those two versions. 
In this campaign, you save up to 31% off the expected retail price of SuperHub ($100), but the amount is limited, and this promotion is only available through this campaign. Start pledging now!SuperHub includes a versatile USB-C to USB-C cable. This cable supports 4K@60Hz video display, 5 Gbps data transfer and up to 60W charging speed (with a 60W power supply), which fully supports all functions of SuperHub and other compatible devices. SuperHub comes with an AC cable. If you’d rather plug SuperHub directly into the wall, a global adapter kit will be available as an add-on. This global adapter kit includes four regional adapters (US, UK, EU, and AU), which means SuperHub can work in over 200 countries and regions.Here is the full list of the package contents. Please note accessories are different in two versions.  Zendure was founded in 2013 by Tom Haflinger and Bryan Liu. Zendure has a portfolio of innovative premium quality products with over 20,000 backers on Kickstarter, including A-Series, the world's first crush-proof external batteries; SuperTank, a massive portable charger, which has brought in over $1,000,000 USD in funding worldwide, and SuperMini, a credit card size 10,000mAh portable chargers with 18W Power Delivery. All of our crowdfunding projects are successfully funded and fulfilled. Base on the abundant experience in charging technology and innovation, we launched SuperHub now.

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>We are creating a brand new product with a new manufacturing partner, which adds risk to our delivery time table. The schedule that we have outlined on our campaign page has built-in margin to account for unforeseen challenges, but extreme circumstances may cause delays. As you know, we are launching amidst a global pandemic. These difficult circumstances may lead to unexpected situations that could result in delayed delivery. FlipGrip is currently being prepared for manufacturing, and will be manufactured using common methods, which leads us to believe that we will be able to deliver on schedule.</p>

We have partnered with ANDesign to help prepare FlipGrip and FlipMount for injection molding. ANDesign is a fully integrated product design firm with an abundance of experience in the development of mobile accessories.
 




 

 
Risks and Challenges
We are creating a brand new product with a new manufacturing partner, which adds risk to our delivery time table. The schedule that we have outlined on our campaign page has built-in margin to account for unforeseen challenges, but extreme circumstances may cause delays. As you know, we are launching amidst a global pandemic. These difficult circumstances may lead to unexpected situations that could result in delayed delivery. FlipGrip is currently being prepared for manufacturing, and will be manufactured using common methods, which leads us to believe that we will be able to deliver on schedule.",41.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>Principle and key Technique</h1>
<p>For traditional compound microscopes, the magnification mainly relies on its complex optical system, which includes objective and eyepiece. Its magnification is a combination of the magnification of objective and eyepiece.</p>
<p>For iMicro, three stages of magnification are combined together to achieve the total magnification. First, the lens provides optical magnification to generate the image on the smartphone camera's sensor; second, the image on the sensor is displayed on the much larger screen via the electronic process and magnification; third, digital zoom provides further magnification as a digital magnification to the image. The total magnification is a combination of these three. </p>

 Extremely low profile

It is about the size of a fingertip, and weighs only 1.5g (~1/20 oz). It is very thin, only 3.5mm (1/8 inch). No parts extrude beyond the edge of your phone when it is installed.

Affordable to every budget
 
We like iMicro and would like everyone to be able to afford it. So, even though it has such an excellent performance, it will be tagged with a very attractive price: ~1 percent of the cost of a traditional desktop microscope. This means, with the money you would need to buy a traditional desktop microscope, you will be able to buy many iMicro.

Principle and key Technique
For traditional compound microscopes, the magnification mainly relies on its complex optical system, which includes objective and eyepiece. Its magnification is a combination of the magnification of objective and eyepiece.
For iMicro, three stages of magnification are combined together to achieve the total magnification. First, the lens provides optical magnification to generate the image on the smartphone camera's sensor; second, the image on the sensor is displayed on the much larger screen via the electronic process and magnification; third, digital zoom provides further magnification as a digital magnification to the image. The total magnification is a combination of these three. 

Therefore, iMicro uses a different process and technology compared to a traditional microscope. Thanks to the advance of micro-optics and smartphone technology, with the effort and expertise accumulated in the past years, we have enabled iMicro to achieve excellent performance at a low cost.
The key techniques to achieve its high performance
Dedicated optics: multi-element aspherical micro-lensThe lens is the key component of the system. A small ball lens (van Leeuwenhoek) is a simple approach. But it is well known to suffer from a very limited usable field of view due to severe field curvature effects and spherical and other aberrations. iMicro uses a more complex multi-aspherical lens with a dedicated design, to achieve both the high performance of magnification and low aberration. Innovative illumination: integrated light guideLight and illumination are very important to microscopy. Nowadays, every smartphone comes with a camera as well as flash light. iMicro utilizes the light from flash to illuminate the sample, via an innovative light guide technique to introduce the light to the point of the lens view field and provide strong enough illumination. Seamless coupling with smartphone: Nano-pad attachment
Different from conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's foot-pads, it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro suction cups to hold the device to the phone. Every on and off application will leave nothing on the phone. This newly developed ""nano suction pad"" is residue-free, non-tacky and repeatable. The use of nano-suction pad has been proofed in our previous product and it is repeatable and easily be cleaned by a PSA tape.

Precise focus control: automatic + manual focus  
Every smartphone now has an auto-focus function. When iMicro is coupled with smartphone, this automatic focus function also works. We have precisely designed and machined iMicro to accurately control the focus point. As long as you put it against a sample plane, the sample falls into the auto focus range and it will automatically focus for a clear image.
μRuler and Dedicated App: for professional needs

A high quality μRuler (stage micrometer) will be provided (as an option) with iMicro to calibrate the scale-bar in APP and measure size. Please see our previous campaign μRuler - A micro-Ruler to measure the micro objects for more information.

It is important to keep a scale-bar and ensure its accuracy on micrograph. The dedicated APP i-Seeing was designed to take micrographs to meet professional demand. Scale-bar on the micrograph could be tangled on/off to let you be able to embed a scale-bar on the image.


 Structure and technical details


iMicro will be coupled with your smartphone by nano-pad. For phones with an extruded camera, a shim pad will compensate the difference between the smartphone surface and the camera. Therefore, iMicro is compatible with most smartphones, and both android and iOS versions of the App have been developed.  

To achieve best portability, iMicro (and microRuler, shim pad, reflecting pad) will be packed in a thin case of size similar to a credit card. As well as protecting iMicro, it will be very easy to carry. For example, you can put it in your wallet and use it everywhere. 

How to use it?
The iMicro has been designed to be simple for everyone to use. No complex knobs and adjustment: just align it with phone's camera, attach it to the phone, turn on flash light with the App, and then point at the sample or any interesting things you would like to see.

 
How to clean the nano-Pad?
In case the nano-Pad becomes non-sticky due to collecting dust, simply clean it with a normal pressure sensitive adhesive tape. It will then be cleaned and refreshed. The video shows a nano-Pad that was contaminated by wheat flour and how it was refreshed by PSA tape.

"" -  AppleInsider  ""Crowdfunded SuperTank battery promises 100W output over USB Type-C"" - Android Police ""Zendure aims to set the standard for charging on the go with a high-capacity, high-speed power bank."" - Engadget ""If you are a power heavy, connected traveller then the Zendure SuperTank should be ticking all your requirements!"" - TECH FOR TRAVEL  First Hands-on Video of SuperTank by AppleInsider:  27,000 mAh portable charger with dual USB-C PD (100W + 60W) & dual USB-A ports that can quickly charge MacBook Pros & other compatible devices.   Most portable chargers on the market are underpowered with low USB-C power output (18/30/45/60W). When charging devices that require a high USB-C output, like MacBook Pro (87W), it will take much longer than you wish or expect. SuperTank packs up to 100W of USB-C Power Delivery in a single port which can serve as both an input and an output. Thanks to its 100W output, SuperTank can charge your 15"" MacBook Pro 2018 at full speed, only taking 1.5 hours to charge from 0% to 100% (when not in use). Together with 27,000 mAh capacity, SuperTank can even double your MacBook Pro battery life.   SuperTank can be charged at up to 100W via Power Delivery. To enable fast charging via Power Delivery, you need a wall charger that can deliver enough power (100W or more) as well as a USB-C cable that supports 5A current throughput.  
The total maximum output of the four USB ports is 138W, putting SuperTank in a class of its own. Thanks to its two PD-enabled USB-C ports and two USB-A ports, SuperTank allows you to charge four devices at the same time, including laptops, tablets, cameras, cell phones, and other mobile devices. With USB-C Power Delivery becoming more and more popular, you can charge additional compatible devices such as security cameras, projectors, LED lights, and more. With such powerful output, SuperTank can provide rapid charging for two laptops or tablets and two mobile devices all at once. Pass-through charging is very helpful if you like to keep your portable charger at full capacity. With dual USB-C ports, you can charge SuperTank and your other USB-C compatible devices at the same time. 100W Power Delivery makes it possible to charge your laptop (up to 60W USB-C Power Delivery) when recharging SuperTank. An ultra-high capacity portable charger does more than just charge your smartphone or tablet to full power multiple times. SuperTank’s massive 27,000 mAh capacity keeps you power on the go. It can extend your 15"" Macbook Pro battery life for 8 hours or charge your iPhone XS seven times.27,000 mAh / 100Wh is also the maximum airline safe battery capacity approved by TSA/EASA for air travel. SuperTank is equipped with eight power cells, which are commonly used by premium electric vehicles but rarely seen in consumer electronics. Compared with traditional lithium-ion batteries, power cells provide 5x faster charging speeds and generate much less heat, reducing the risk of decreased performance or damage. In addition, SuperTank has nine layers of safety protection: overcharge protection, over discharge protection, dual temperature protection, short-circuit protection, output overpower protection, output overcurrent protection, input overcurrent protection, input overvoltage protection, and MCU reset. One thing worth special attention is SuperTank’s dual-temperature protection units (dual-NTC). This means even if one of the temperature protection units fails, the other back-up sensor will keep monitoring the temperature to ensure the safety of you and your devices. SuperTank isn’t only designed for high-power devices. Most portable chargers on the market have a common problem: they are not able to charge low-power devices, as they have a minimum output ranging from 80mA to 150mA. However, some low-consumption devices, especially wearable devices, usually draw less current than that and cause a portable charger to automatically shut off.X-Charge mode is designed to charge an almost unlimited range of low-power devices, including smart watches, Bluetooth earphones, fitness bands, and more. It's a great feature for people who enjoy exploring the outdoors or tracking their exercise. Double-press the power button, and SuperTank will enter X-Charge mode and display the ""X"" icon. Double-press again to turn off X-Charge mode. With SuperTank, your wearable devices have never been treated better. As a member of the Zendure A-Series battery family, SuperTank still adopts the classic ridged design. SuperTank is made from a durable composite material (polycarbonate + ABS) that's used in a vast array of other resilient products, including high-end suitcases. The exterior shell is reinforced by support ridges to resist warping. SuperTank is designed to be tough enough to go anywhere, while also making sure it looks good enough that you'd want to take it everywhere. In the beginning, we have compared many form factors such as the long and slim shape that you often see the market from other products, but we decided to adopt this shape because of the following benefits: 1. The product is much shorter. Most 27,000mAh power banks on the market are really, really long, and it's actually taking a lot more space than the shorter form factor. 2. It can stand up firmly because of the design, so that a user can access the four ports conveniently. 3. The wider end surface enabled us to add four USB ports, instead of only three, and the digital LED screen in the middle, forming a perfect symmetry. We worked tirelessly to produce a battery that functions perfectly and is easy to use.  SuperTank’s Digital LED Display lets you know exactly how much power is left so you won't get caught running on empty. This user-friendly feature is absolutely necessary for high-capacity portable phone chargers. Sometimes, when you use a typical Power Delivery portable charger to power your laptop, it will charge itself instead. SuperTank comes with a PD direction switch feature to keep you in control. Give the power button a long press, and you’ll switch the direction of SuperTank’s power flow to ensure the laptop is being charged. Similarly, you could also allow the laptop to charge SuperTank by long-pressing the power button again. With UPS mode, there will be no power interruption when switching between pass-through and battery mode, making it ideal for applications such as security system, microcontrollers, home automation, network storage, backup power for WiFi routers, and more. There’s no need to worry about short interruptions of power that will cause the devices being charged to reboot and lose data.  To charge your SuperTank at maximum speed, you need a compatible 100W USB-C charger and a USB-C cable that supports 5A current throughput. That’s why we are also introducing Zendure SuperPort 4. This is the first desktop charger to offer industry leading 100W USB-C charging technology, making it a perfect companion for SuperTank. With 100W maximum USB-C Power Delivery,  SuperPort can charge the latest USB-C devices at top speed, including MacBook Pro, MacBook, iPad Pro, iPhone XS, Nintendo Switch and more.SuperPort 4 features two USB-C ports and two USB ports with Zen+2.0, allowing you to charge up to four devices simultaneously with a maximum combined output of 136W.   SuperPort 4 is designed as a companion for SuperTank. The look and feel of SuperPort 4 communicate this relationship.We provide power cords for a variety of regions. You can select the one you need during the survey stage of our campaign.

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Lantern Explained</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/>Lantern is an amazing device fed by a stream of data from Outernet's satellite network. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Lantern continuously receives radio waves broadcast by Outernet from space. Lantern turns the signal into digital files, like webpages, news articles, ebooks, etc, which are automatically saved for on-demand offline access. Just connect to the device's hotspot.</p>
<p><b>Global. </b>Outernet covers every continent, so you can access continuously updated content wherever you go. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Free data forever.</b> Because we met our original funding goal, Lantern will receive about 20 MB/day. You never have to pay for data, ever. </p>
<p><b>Extremely portable</b>. We have made several design changes, but the final product will be the size and weight of a hardcover book</p>
<p><b>Solar charged</b>. When power is not available to charge your Lantern, just set Lantern in the sun.</p>
<p>Lantern is NOT a way to access the Internet. Lantern receives a one-way stream of files. You cannot send email or post to Facebook using Lantern. Think of Lantern as being for data what FM radio is for audio or broadcast TV is for video.</p>
</div>
</div><div>
<div><p><br/></p></div>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Build Your Lantern</h1>
<div>
<p>We pre-sold almost 5,000 complete Lanterns, shattering our goal thanks to the enthusiastic support of our backers! We are currently in the final design and testing stages. </p>
<p>Now, we are offering the opportunity to build your own Lantern with the<b> Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Receiver Kit</b>. It's everything you need to make your own Lantern, minus the enclosure, solar panel, and USB ports.</p>
<p>The <b>DIY Receiver Kit</b> includes:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Custom L-Band Patch Antenna</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Amplifier</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Software Defined Radio (SDR)</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>C.H.I.P. single board computer with Outernet software pre-installed</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Portable Battery</b></p></li>
</ul>
<br/>
</div>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">How Lantern And Outernet Work</h1>
<div>
<p>Outernet is the most innovative and far-reaching information service ever created, and Lantern makes it even more accessible. Here is a quick overview of how the system works:</p>
<p>1. Outernet broadcasts a file around the world over a satellite signal in a process that is similar to what happens with satellite radio, but the content can be in any format.</p>
<p>2. Lantern uses its internal antenna to receive the signal.  The tuner selects the frequency, turning the analog waves into digital bits, and passes the bits to the compute module. At this stage, these bits are turned into digital files, which are all stored in the device's memory.</p>
<p>3. Lantern acts like a local server for the saved content, and emits a WiFi hotspot. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Users can connect to this WiFi with any device to access the saved content.</span></p>
<p>This may sound complicated, but Lantern is really a pretty simple device. The best way to think of Lantern is a cross between an FM radio and WiFi router. It's really that simple. </p>
<br/>
</div>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Enjoy Content Anywhere</h1>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div><br/></div> <p>Outernet is an audacious project, but it is completely feasible. There are numerous hurdles that stand in our way and we are ready to face them. Here are many of the questions we have received in forums, on Reddit, over social media, and in our inboxes answered by Syed Karim, Outernet's CEO:</p>
<p><b>Why are you trying to give people free information when millions of people are starving?</b></p>
<p>When reduced to this simple metric for making a difference, why are any of us doing any of our jobs (except those that are feeding people)? Though, this question gets at a bigger idea of why prioritize information access on the long list of global problems to solve. The subject has been studied extensively, but the first to come to mind is Amartya Sen, who wrote in his book <i>Development as Freedom</i> about this very issue. In one example, he cited the 1974 Bangladeshi famine during which food production was ironically quite high. He points to the failure of governance, rather than a food shortage, as the reason. This is just one example. A better predictor of quality of life is not abundance of resources (see Africa) but the level of freedom enjoyed by the population. When it comes to advancing freedom, there is no better tool than information.</p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>Who operates the
Outernet Project? (how many people, which company, how many partners, etc.)</b></p>
<p>Outernet Inc operates the transmission. We have probably a
dozen or so people from both within the company as well as close partners that
are integral to making this all work. </p>
<p><b>How is the Outernet
project financed, and how big is the budget?</b></p>
<p>We are a private company that has received seed financing by
a media-focused impact investment fund: Media Development Investment
Fund. </p>
<p><b>What is the actual
state of the Outernet project? (how many satellites, how many users, in how
many areas is Outernet already possible)?</b></p>
<p>We are on two satellites now, but expect to be on five or
six by the end of the year, which will give us fully global coverage. We can
currently reach all of North America, Europe, and MENA. We are in the process
of acquiring a Sub-Saharan signal at the moment. </p>
<p><b>There are projects
with similar goals, like Project Loon from Google and Internet.org from Facebook. How are these other projects different from Outernet?</b></p>
<p>Those are not similar services as they are trying to provide
two-way Internet to everyone. That is a commendable goal and we absolutely want
them to succeed, but it will also be a fee-based service. Outernet's signal is
free to receive. There are also sovereign air space issues with Internet devices, like balloons and drones, inside the atmosphere. Breaking censorship will be difficult in places where a free Internet is unwanted. You also encounter enormous spectrum regulation when the user device goes from being a receiver to a transmitter (it talks back). So you can see they are not competing services, as we are
solving a problem for a different segment of the market. </p>
<p><b>Does Outernet ever plan to offer Internet service?</b></p>
<p>Some day we might offer two-way Internet access. But that is independent of our belief that there should always be a bare minimum of broadcast data, just like the advent of Netflix does not mean we should eliminate public television. A one-way data cast ensures anonymity - no one can track what you choose to keep and use from our broadcast. For this reason, a two-way service will not be compatible with Lantern, which is a receive-only device. </p>
<p><b>What is your revenue
model?</b></p>
<p>We have several revenue lines, which increase and decrease
relative to each other, based on where we are in the company's growth. Those
revenue lines are: </p>
<p>1. Content distribution</p>
<p>2. Project support services</p>
<p>3. Hardware sales</p>
<p>4. Advertising</p>
<p>5. Retainers for communication services</p>
<p><b>What is the bandwidth
used for up and downloads?</b></p>
<p>Since we are hooking directly into the satellite operator’s
infrastructure, our uplink bandwidth is really not measured. For Lantern, the download rate will begin at 20 MB/day. From there, we can unlock different regions as we raise more funds to rent more satellite capacity.</p>
<p><b>Are you looking to
put cubesats into sub-orbital or orbital paths?</b></p>
<p>Cubesats are one option for owning our own infrastructure.
It is simply a platform and there are a couple other form factors with even
more heritage that could perform just as well (if not better). Though it makes
tremendous strategic sense to eventually own our infrastructure, this is a
costly proposition (around $10 million). From the perspective of delivering data to a mobile
receiver, we could use both geostationary infrastructure as well as existing
LEO assets for a mobile service. Deploying our own constellation across
numerous planes reduces the risk that our service will be shut down due to the
delivery of content that has been censored by some sovereigns.  </p>
<p><b>How do you address the 3 week
decay rate at 90 miles up in sub-orbit?</b></p>
<p>We would never deploy to a 90-mile orbit. Our target planes
are an equatorial orbit, sun-synchronous orbit, as well as a 60-degree
inclination at between 500 and 600 kilometers. The mission duration at that
altitude is five years. Early next year, we may be leasing a small satellite
that is already at that altitude and it has been operating for 10 years. </p>
<p><b>What is the present
cost to launch a series of cube sats and who would do so?</b></p>
<p>Our target price for a cubesat is $100,000 per unit, with
another $100,000 allocated to the launch of each satellite. A point to
consider, however, is that the determining factor is not the number of cubesats
or their sizes, but the data delivered to the ground on a daily basis. The real
metric is therefore the cost per daily global megabyte. We could achieve global
coverage through as few as 12 satellites to a 600 km orbit. The unit cost of
each of those microsatellites is higher than a cubesat, but the mission
duration and global coverage is superior. There are actually quite a few variables
at play, which make this a somewhat complicated question to answer. But a quick
and direct answer to your question is that we could deploy a globally
accessible constellation for as little as $6M and do so within 18 months. We
have launches already identified. </p>
<p><b>What about censorship
of the whole concept? Many governments may not like uncontrolled data streams
and many are already intercepting everything.</b></p>
<p>We planned for anti-censorship from the beginning. Our
mobile receiver, which I have written very little about, is a frequency agile
receiver. This means that if one frequency is jammed, we simply move to an
alternative--and can do this across 5 difference channels (or more). Since Outernet
is a broadcast solution, the monitoring stations are actually irrelevant, since
the reception of broadcast content ensures the anonymity of consumption. Since
we use existing spectrum licenses, our anti-censorship plan is all perfectly
legal and abides by all restrictions of local jurisdictions. But since we are
broadcasting data in a multi-channel, multi-speed, and super duplicated manner,
it just makes it hard to selectively censor specific works that we distribute.
Of course, a government is always able to continuously jam all of our
frequencies (this is a little more difficult for certain bands), but which
government wants to be the one that is publicly known for disrupting humanity's
public library? My hypothesis is that our global brand equity will offer more
resilience to government censorship than any of our technical strategies. </p>

Lantern Explained



Lantern is an amazing device fed by a stream of data from Outernet's satellite network. 

Lantern continuously receives radio waves broadcast by Outernet from space. Lantern turns the signal into digital files, like webpages, news articles, ebooks, etc, which are automatically saved for on-demand offline access. Just connect to the device's hotspot.
Global. Outernet covers every continent, so you can access continuously updated content wherever you go. 

Free data forever. Because we met our original funding goal, Lantern will receive about 20 MB/day. You never have to pay for data, ever. 
Extremely portable. We have made several design changes, but the final product will be the size and weight of a hardcover book
Solar charged. When power is not available to charge your Lantern, just set Lantern in the sun.
Lantern is NOT a way to access the Internet. Lantern receives a one-way stream of files. You cannot send email or post to Facebook using Lantern. Think of Lantern as being for data what FM radio is for audio or broadcast TV is for video.



Build Your Lantern

We pre-sold almost 5,000 complete Lanterns, shattering our goal thanks to the enthusiastic support of our backers! We are currently in the final design and testing stages. 
Now, we are offering the opportunity to build your own Lantern with the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Receiver Kit. It's everything you need to make your own Lantern, minus the enclosure, solar panel, and USB ports.
The DIY Receiver Kit includes:


Custom L-Band Patch Antenna
Amplifier
Software Defined Radio (SDR)
C.H.I.P. single board computer with Outernet software pre-installed
Portable Battery



How Lantern And Outernet Work

Outernet is the most innovative and far-reaching information service ever created, and Lantern makes it even more accessible. Here is a quick overview of how the system works:
1. Outernet broadcasts a file around the world over a satellite signal in a process that is similar to what happens with satellite radio, but the content can be in any format.
2. Lantern uses its internal antenna to receive the signal.  The tuner selects the frequency, turning the analog waves into digital bits, and passes the bits to the compute module. At this stage, these bits are turned into digital files, which are all stored in the device's memory.
3. Lantern acts like a local server for the saved content, and emits a WiFi hotspot. Users can connect to this WiFi with any device to access the saved content.
This may sound complicated, but Lantern is really a pretty simple device. The best way to think of Lantern is a cross between an FM radio and WiFi router. It's really that simple. 


Enjoy Content Anywhere



Everyone on Earth can use Lantern. There are many ways to use this versatile device:

Download news, weather, books for FREE
Access to information, freedom from censorship
Consume content anonymously 
Travel with news, weather, and entertainment wherever you go 
Create your own media archive




What happens when the next Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Sandy destroys cellular networks? In times of natural disaster or conflict, Outernet still works and delivers disaster updates. No one should face crisis without access to updated information. With Lantern, continuously updated information is always available.




All data consumed on Lantern is anonymous. Access to news, civic information, commodity prices, weather, construction plans for open source farm machinery...anything. Outernet eradicates information poverty and censorship everywhere on Earth. Since Lantern is so small, it can be used discreetly. 




A library in every pocket means digital courseware can be delivered anywhere. From young children learning to adults, everyone can benefit from Outernet’s digital media archive. 
Other ways to use Lantern:
Wi-Fi Library For Your Kids. Kids love their (or your) mobile devices; now give them a free, safe library to explore. You decide what to keep on Lantern -- or add files yourself, so there aren't any surprises.
Travel Smart. News, Maps, Weather... Everywhere. Have you ever landed abroad and not had data? Never again. Lantern is ideal for the sailor, outdoorsman, pilot, soldier... the list goes on.
Share and Collect Files. No need to pass a flash drive around the room. With Lantern, everyone can share and add information whenever you like. Grant users access to your Lantern and you're done. Simple.

Buy a Lantern, support Outernet, and help us find the answers. This campaign is to fund the creation of Lantern and a 20 MB/day broadcast on a new frequency that can be received without a dish. The more money we raise, the more we can do - including launching our own satellites into orbit.

   What Could Our Species Accomplish?





Imagine if every person could learn for free. 
Imagine if there were no more dark patches of people without access to information.
Imagine if the lights came on.
Never before in human history has there been an opportunity to raise the bar for everyone at once so dramatically. Outernet is such an inflection point.

<p>Why carry and pay for two things, when you can just use one! In the market, there are two chips that are sold separately into different devices. CSR1010 (Bluetooth music and hands free calling) and BLE (tracking, pin location, selfies, and voice record) have never been combined to one until now. HiSmart has combined the two chips together because we believe people should be able to access all of the functions possible without paying extra.</p>
<p>The CSR1010 works within a range of 66 feet and the BLE works within a range of 164 feet. The HiRemote has a battery of 150mAh that can last for 10 hours on a full charge!</p>

</div></div>","HiSmart is the first-of-its-kind that merges fashion and technology, a bag that not         only changes according to your capacity needs and occasion, but also vastly simplifying the way you connect to people, places and things.  It’s not just stylish             and cool, but it makes our busy, urban lives more efficient and enjoyable. 

              After thousands of design drafts and dozens of different prototypes, we finally made HiSmart that is beautifully and minimally designed. It can transform    into two different styles and is made with canvas and handmade Italian leather.
The specially designed HiRemote syncs with the HiSmart app. The 2-in-1 customized chip inside the strap enables you to pin locations, find your HiSmart or phone, answer calls, listen to music,  record your voice, and take selfies in just seconds.HiSmart redefines the bag by making it do more functions than you thought possible.
Make your life simpler with our HiSmart app! It's specially designed to pair with the HiRemote so you're able to access your favorite apps in just seconds! 






























Forget about jotting down the location of that one cafe you stumbled upon last week or trying to remember where you parked your car. With HiSmart you can just pin them. Your saved locations are in the app and cloud! It can be shared to social media with a status update.





The HiSmart alerts you of incoming calls so you can answer them with the push of a button on your HiRemote without ever taking out your phone. You can also choose to ignore the calls.







You certainly don't want to lose your bag or phone! If you forget your bag, your phone will alert you and map it to the last location if connection is lost. If you can't find your phone, you can push a button on the HiRemote and the phone alarm will sound loud enough for you to hear it!






Nothing beats listening to your favorite tunes or audio books on the commute. Now you can play, pause, skip and control the volume with one finger.







You just had a great idea.  Don’t worry about searching for that voice recorder app! Simply click the HiRemote and speak. Your files will be saved in the app and can be emailed.



No more struggling to push that camera button for group selfies. No more awkward selfie sticks! Simply click the HiRemote and the app can help you take photos. You can then find them in your gallery.






Design shouldn’t be just for looks. We tailored handmade high-quality materials and were meticulous with the details to create a bag that would meet the lifestyle of the modern explorer. For us, beauty isn’t enough.  We complete the package with function and design.







It’s a messenger bag.  It’s a backpack.  It’s both.  It takes less than a second to transform HiSmart from a long-strapped  messenger bag to a double-strapped backpack. It's versatile looks is perfect for any occasion whether it's to a party or the office.




12 POCKET ORGANIZER: Do you wish your bag had more compartments for all your belongings? With HiSmart’s 12 pockets you’ll have a place for everything—from  keys to notebooks to laptops.
WATERPROOF CANVAS: Rain or shine, this bag's got your tech devices and you covered.
NYLON: Durable and longlasting.
45 DEGREE SUPPORT: Strong enough to hold anything.
ITALIAN LEATHER STRAP: It's engraved number makes it easy to remember which length is ideal.
GERMAN FIDLOCK: Opens with a half twist and closes magnetically. It's as simple as that.












We’re all bag and backpack fanatics here at Lepow. We considered over 300 HiSmart designs during this journey because we strived to develop a bag that pushes the limits of functionality and technology. It was time, we felt, for a new era of bags to emerge! We’ve noticed that the wearable technologies that tried to change our habits never really took off. We therefore created a bag - something that is already part of our everyday lives - but added “smart” functions to it that conforms to our modern lives. We believe that we shouldn't need to adapt to technology, but technology should adapt to us. 


We worked hard to create this bag—from drafting  sketches, to sewing  prototypes, to  engineering the HiSmart controller. We’ve dedicated ourselves  to provide amazing features to make the life of the urban explorer more efficient and enjoyable.


Although we are bag fanatics, this is our first smart wearable project!We truly want to make this a reality, but if we want HiSmart to be the ultimate wearable bag, we need your thoughts, comments, and support for this project. All the funding will go into creating and manufacturing the HiSmart.

Anything from a comment to monetary support means a lot to us. Our team is eager to back up your ideas to improve the HiSmart Pack and take it to our engineers and designers to deliver. And don’t forget to share with your social media networks. 
























under""smart bag"" tag, 10 characters only.WE WILL SEND YOU AN EMAIL IN ONE WEEK TO LET YOU SELECT A COLOR :)


We want to sincerely thank you for all the support and hope you can support us just a little bit more by spreading the news of our Indiegogo launch through your social media. It would mean the world to us.







The bag is light at only 1.5 lbs! You won't have to carry any unnecessary weight with the HiSmart.



Why carry and pay for two things, when you can just use one! In the market, there are two chips that are sold separately into different devices. CSR1010 (Bluetooth music and hands free calling) and BLE (tracking, pin location, selfies, and voice record) have never been combined to one until now. HiSmart has combined the two chips together because we believe people should be able to access all of the functions possible without paying extra.
The CSR1010 works within a range of 66 feet and the BLE works within a range of 164 feet. The HiRemote has a battery of 150mAh that can last for 10 hours on a full charge!

The HiSmart Team consists of young entrepreneurs, designers, engineers, and marketers whose passion for technology and love for design brought them together to create the HiSmart. 









A LOT OF AMAZING PEOPLE HELP US MAKE IT HAPPEN! Thank you for our Director Peter, App designer Soya.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

Or ever, frankly. While a traditional travel adapter features a single-use fuse that will need to be replaced in the event that too much current is drawn, Passport eschewed the rustic charm of having to fix your own electronics in favor of an auto-resetting fuse. User feedback suggests we were really onto something. Passport 30W takes after its predecessor in this regard. If too much current is drawn, the circuit will temporarily stop the flow of electricity, resuming again after a few seconds. It’s one less thing to worry about when you’re far from home. </p><div data-id=""25395943""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><div data-id=""25224336""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1560873598/lsziiiizo4svpnnvocjz.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Our research indicated that people find multi-part travel adapters frustrating.

And it shouldn’t involve compromise. To get all your devices charged, you need at least three products: a USB charger for multiple devices, a travel adapter for power outlets, and a power adapter for your laptop. If that sounds like overkill, we agree. Introducing Passport 30W, the ultimate worry-free powerhouse that packs a 4-port USB charger with 30W Power Delivery (PD), a travel adapter with auto-resetting fuse, and a power adapter into one sleek unit. This all-in-one adapter allows you to charge up to 5 devices together in over 200 countries and regions.Two years ago, we set a new standard for convenience and style with our trailblazing travel adapter, Passport. It was the first travel adapter to feature an auto-resetting fuse. With four USB ports, a convenient all-in-one design, and standout aesthetics, Passport became an instant favorite, even earning a Good Design Award in 2017 from the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design. Now, we’re raising the bar again with the next generation in travel technology: Passport 30W. We kept everything people loved about the original Passport and made significant upgrades for superior compatibility and performance, based on feedback from real users. In short, we’ve made it faster, more powerful, and compatible with the latest devices.

 
 
 
 

 
    Note: Full 30W Power Delivery output available one USB-C port output only.  USB-C PD (Power Delivery) is rapidly becoming the new standard for powering and charging phones, laptops, and a host of other devices. Passport 30W features a 30W USB-C PD port, allowing fast charging for your USB-C devices, including MacBook, iPad, iPhone, portable chargers, Nintendo Switch, cameras and more.  Traveling comes with a unique set of demands, including the need to power and charge several devices in a limited amount of space. Smaller travel adapters can only accommodate two or three devices at a time. Passport 30W has a USB-C port, three USB-A ports, and a multi-region AC output, charging up to five devices all at once. Passport was the first travel adapter to acknowledge a simple fact: People don’t like searching through an electronics store to find a replacement fuse while traveling. Or ever, frankly. While a traditional travel adapter features a single-use fuse that will need to be replaced in the event that too much current is drawn, Passport eschewed the rustic charm of having to fix your own electronics in favor of an auto-resetting fuse. User feedback suggests we were really onto something. Passport 30W takes after its predecessor in this regard. If too much current is drawn, the circuit will temporarily stop the flow of electricity, resuming again after a few seconds. It’s one less thing to worry about when you’re far from home.  Our research indicated that people find multi-part travel adapters frustrating. They can be difficult to use, and pieces can often be lost. Passport 30W has no removable parts. Easy to pack, easy to unpack, and easy to use. Simply press and slide the buttons to select the appropriate connector with just one hand.  Our priority is innovative functionality, but we will never compromise on design. Passport is co-designed with Y Studios, an award-winning design firm based in San Francisco that has won numerous Red Dot, iF, and Good Design awards in the past. We worked closely for nearly two years on this project. Thanks to its revolutionary innovation and beautiful industrial design, Passport won a Good Design Award in 2017 from the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design. It also earned many accolades from our customers. For Passport 30W, we adopted this beautiful design and upgraded one USB-A port to USB-C for 30W Power Delivery. Also, this USB-C port is highlighted in blue to differentiate it from USB-A ports and compliment Passport’s “Press and Slide” buttons.  A traditional travel adapter with wide-open slots can be easily explored by a curious toddler using any small object, and this poses a risk of shock. Passport 30W's universal AC output has a child-proof shield to make sure that the outlet is only used for plugs. We designed this proprietary baby-proof shield to reduce potential safety hazards. Zendure is well known for our durable products, and Passport 30W comes with a 2-Year Warranty with exceptional customer service.

In addition to useful features such as dedicated App, embedded scale-bar, it has its own illumination system, which is programmed to provide 3 different modes for observation. Moreover, its innovative nano-pad connection method enable it to be able to work with most smartphones.Here are some micrographs took with it:It is programmed to control the illumination by clicking one button, therefore you can select the illumination among white illumination of high angle, white illumination of low angle (a mode between bright field and dark field) and 375nm UV illumination to achieve best observation of a certain sample.The features of iMICROSCOPEAluminum alloy body with solid qualityIt is made of air-craft grade aluminum alloy with CNC machining, anodized finishing and a unique serial No. engraved by mechanical process.   Coated aspherical glass lens  An aspheric lens is a lens whose surfaces profile neither a portion of a sphere nor of a circular cylinder. An aspherical lens is designed for aberration correction. With the help of aspherical lens, distortion is reduced.In addition, a pure glass lens with surface coating will further increase the optical performance.Programmed illumination control  Illumination is very important for photography as well as for microscopy. Three illumination components are integrated around the microscopic lens, provide different illumination modes, which is available at click of one button. As shown below a banknote of 20USD observed under different illumination modes. The florescence paints with miniature prints is clearly shown under UV illumination. 
Battery level indicator  4 stage battery level indicator with blue LED is designed to show the status of battery level and charging status.Dedicated APP and μRulerDue to the lack of sense on size in microscopic world, it is important to keep a scale-bar and ensure its accuracy on micrograph. The dedicated APP i-SEEING was designed to take micrographs to meet professional demand. Scale-bar on the micrograph could be tangled on/off to let you be able to embed a scale-bar on the image. In addition, a high quality μRuler (stage micrometer) will be also provided with iMICROSCOPE to calibrate and assure accuracy of the scale-bar. Please see our previous campaign μRuler - A micro-Ruler to measure the micro objects for more information.Nano-pad - durable and easy cleaningiMICROSCOPE is designed for different Phone models, this is achieved with nano-pad to connect with different phones. Different from conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's foot-pads, it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro suction cups to hold the device to the phone. Every on and off application will leave nothing on the phone. This newly developed ""nano suction pad"" is residue-free, non-tacky and repeatable.This nano suction pad is also easily to be cleaned by touching it with a PSA tape. So it could be used again and again. Here is a demo that it was contaminated by some dust (wheat flour), after cleaning with a PSA tape, it resumed its function as fresh.Easy to use and work with most smartphonesIn addition to all these features, it is very easy to use, no complex tuning and adjusting necessary. Just put it on your iPhone, turn it on and point it against what you are interested to look, that's it.  Thanks to the nano-pad connection method, it is able to accomodate most of the current smartphones, either for those with a flat camera or extruded camera. For those with double-lens, only one lens need to be slected to use. Highlight and Specification Rewards  Time line Let others know iMICROSCOPE!iMicroscope is a perfect gift for everyone who needs microscope, likes shooting extreme macros and exploring the micro-objects...

Español|Pycckий|Italiano|Deutsch|日本語|Le françaisBlackview BL6000 Pro 5G is one of a kind. It’s the first 5G rugged phone with industry-leading IP68 & IP69K & MIL-STD-810G rated waterproof, dropproof and dustproof performance. It inherits the TOUGH DNA from Blackview rugged phone legacy to withstand any possible damage that a regular phone hardly bear. And it’s equipped with cutting-edge 5G strength to give you the blazing fast 5G connectivity to match every need. On top of that, it can work in -30℃ freezing temperature that no other phones can do in the market. The top-notch camera system can’t let the photography lovers down either. And it has large storage, long-lasting battery, crystal clear display to get everything done perfectly.Blackview has always striven to offer an ultimate phone solution aimed at combatting the possible damage of water, drops, weather elements, and any other hazardous elements.The BL6000 Pro is designed to act on those issues directly by reforming the phone design and the internal structure so it can be taken anywhere to do anything worry free, like swimming, surfing, rock climbing, etc.
Stereotype is meant to be broken. A phone actually doesn’t need to be carefully protected from water, drops, bumps, shocks, and extreme weathers.Blackview rugged phones have been well-known for superior waterproofness. To dramatically enhance the waterproof performance, this time we introduce an all-new technology - Nano molding, to upgrade the BL6000 Pro’s waterproof performance to a next level.Great resistance to daily drops or violence. Tough enough to withstand the unexpected.Featuring the IceMode technology, the BL6000 Pro can perform Phone, Message, Contacts, Camera normally even in a freezing temperature as low as -30℃ when other phones shiver to shut down automatically.Instead of costing you 7 minutes or more to download a 2-hour movie, you can download one in fewer than 10 seconds now with 5G. Technically, it saves you 6 minutes and 50 seconds.The same goes for any other phone use. Everything is silk smooth and efficient. Isn’t it wonderful for people who are always ready for a mission, like the police, fireworkers, first aid workers, as well as when you are rushing the last-minute airplane boarding.And there are much more amazing things about the BL6000 Pro 5G to change your mobile experience in ways you can't imagine.Basically, the BL6000 Pro 5G benefits every aspect in your life, including audio and video entertainment, video creation, gaming, socializing, travelling, business or studying. In other words, the BL6000 Pro 5G saves you time, multiplies the joy, and lets you connect to people more closely. What if the phone is out of 5G coverage? Well, as a 5G-capable phone, it always has more advantage over a 4G phone. If the BL6000 Pro is dropped to 4G network when it’s out of 5G coverage, it can still offer higher speed than 4G-powered phones sharing the same network.Taking photos is essential in everyday life. The BL6000 Pro lets you shoot effortlessly like a pro. It’s equipped with Sony® IMX582 48MP triple rear camera and Samsung® S5K3P9-SP 16MP front camera, coupled with superior processing software and rich features. It’s easy to take amazing photos in almost every situation, day or night, in the water or on the land.Introduce the new Portrait mode - let it artfully grey the background for a studio-style portrait.Even against light, smart HDR is amazing at capturing texture, skin tone, color saturation, and individual details that make photos clear.With Night mode that lets in 30 percent more light, it can capture incredible low-light shots, with greater details in poorly-lit environment. Photos that used to be hard to capture -- like a dark night -- now come out sharper than ever.Tap Underwater, you can press side buttons to control shooting in the pool even if the screen touch shall be disabled under water pressure. (Waterproof up to 1.5m for 30 Mins)Can’t squeeze everything into the frame? Tap Ultra-Wide to take it all in.The 4K shooting now have HDR - producing true-to-life video quality, with greater detail and smooth motion.When it comes to rainy, stormy, sand storm weather, the BL6000 Pro outperforms any other camera phone out there thanks to its excellently waterproof, dropproof, and dustproof performance. Nothing can stop it working.With all those beautiful photos you’ve taken, 5G speed ensures you instantaneous stream anywhere, anytime.With 2300 x 1080 FHD+ resolution and incell technology for superior clarity and vivid colors, everything is responsive and looks stunning. And the advanced 6.36-inch punch hole display offers more of the screen which is less invasive especially when watching a fullscreen video, or gaming.Protected by Corning® Gorilla® Glass, it greatly enhances daily drops and scratches resistance.Performing stressful tasks like gaming on the phone can lead to overheating, which not only ruins your gaming experience but also damages your phone. The BL6000 Pro adopts liquid cooling technology and improves the internal process including infusing cooling gel, triple graphite layering and copper pipes to manage the device's temperature effectively.If you know 5G enough or already have a 5G phone, you may have noticed that the phone's battery drains faster than usual while it’s connected to a 5G network. This is a limitation of the current 5G networks, and will be improved as the networks expand. We’ve known the fact well, and this is why we incorporate a 5280mAh big battery comprising the world-class electrical coring into the BL6000 Pro, and have painstakingly made an optimization on the software to enhance the battery life performance as much as possible. From our laboratory test statistics, the battery power saving performance is improved by 30%.Android 10 OS is smart, swift and efficient with user-friendly features: minimalistic UI, exquisite iconography, intuitive Navigation Gestures, power-saving Dark Mode, Smombie-cure Grayscale, all-apps-in Drawer and much more. Everything is fast, smooth, and efficient.Each phone produced has undergone more than 100+ inspection processes, including shock, vibration, humidity, prolonged high temperature, altitude, immersion etc.The BL6000 Pro is clearly not as elegant as a normal phone, why should I choose it?Well, the BL6000 Pro is absolutely better for you when you:* Crazy about outdoor sports that need your phone to withstand raining, water immersion, and accidentally hard drops onto rough ground.* Work in harsh environments like construction sites, boats, aerial lifts, mining area.* Ever experienced costing a fortune for phone repair after dropping into water, or rough ground.When it comes to 5G, the BL6000 Pro 5G rugged phone is a late comer. Why should I choose it?As a late comer in the 5G-powered phone market, the BL6000 Pro is still unique as it’s the first one that embraces both the 5G edge and the rugged phone strength. So it can do so much crazy things while other 5G phones can’t.Isn’t it wonderful when the device that you use to record your surfing moments is reliably waterproof, and can share them on Instagram right there in a wink? The BL6000 Pro is right up for the task with IP68 & IP69K rated waterproofness and up to 1.25Gbp/s upload speed.With the BL6000 Pro 5G, truly real-time positioning is guaranteed when riding along the city. And it hardly breaks even falling from a speedy vehicle thanks to its military-grade build quality. It’s also amazing when you can vlog and upload instantaneously along the road.Tap the video call, your family show up like right in front of you, and tell them everything is fine. Back to work, the BL6000 Pro is as tough as it should be, withstanding drops or bumps onto the rough ground.You back usNow we back you!All BL6000 Pro backers are eligible to the referral program.

 We do this everyday – mobile photography. But whenever we want to take that one shot,  obstacles stand in our way. Ever since we released the original ShutterGrip™ a year ago, enthusiastic backers have been giving us valuable usage and product enhancement feedback. We took them to heart. Now, we are excited to unveil the second generation ShutterGrip™ with a brand new finish and more flexible ways of controlling the smartphone camera in your pocket. 
No matter how difficult the shooting task, ShutterGrip™ 2 can easily transform your smartphone into a serious camera on-the-fly to take that momentous shot firmly and securely.
    The design goal of ShutterGrip™ 2 is to re-create the comfort and control of a traditional DSLR camera. From the sculpted palm grip to the optimally positioned shutter release button, the final creation is a palm grip that is comfortable to operate with one hand, and a secure camera that is always at the ready by your side. The ShutterGrip™ 2 can be mounted on the left or right side. ShutterGrip™ 2 is compatible with iOS/Android smartphones without the need for any proprietary apps.  Bluetooth pairing is simple and only needs to be done once. Any subsequent re-pairing is automatic with the press of a button.ShutterGrip™ 2 is compatible with any smartphone (iOS/Android) equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 and uses the side button for shutter release. 
 
   ShutterGrip™ 2 supports two 2 popular video taking orientations – landscape and portrait.  When taking landscape videos, hold the camera steady like holding a torch. Place the ShutterGrip™ 2 in the middle of the phone and rotate the palm grip down.
 
Note how ShutterGrip™ 2 folds down to transform into a vertical hand grip.
 For instagram or portrait live-streaming, turn the grip 90 degrees, hold it with one hand, and adjust the pitch of the camera with the other. 
Note how the ShutterGrip™ 2 hand grip transforms from bottom position (for landscape cinematic video taking) to side position (for portrait live-streaming).  
Note how the pitch of the camera can also be adjusted. Both orientations allow you to grip the phone steadily, securely and for an extended period of time.
 In the palm grip is a telescoping arm that extends by 15cm. When not in use, the arm tucks safely inside the palm grip for the next selfie opportunity.  
Note how ShutterGrip™ 2 hand grip folds down and extends the telescoping arm. The shutter remote is also detachable. 
ShutterGrip™ 2 standard cold shoe attaches to a host of accessories like fill light, monitors, microphones and more. When you are shooting at night or in low-light conditions, your smartphone coupled with ShutterGrip™ 2 rivals any professional setup.
  
Note how ShutterGrip™ 2 attaches to different accessories using the cold shoe.   A hidden hex wrench built into the ShutterGrip™ 2 for servicing the arm hinge.  
Note how a hex wrench is removed from the cold shoe for tightening the hinge, as needed. 
 For large group photos or time-lapse videos, use a tripod with ShutterGrip 2. Control the exact timing of the shutter from a distance with the detachable remote.
  
Note how ShutterGrip™ 2 is mounted on a tripod and shutter timing is triggered precisely by the detached remote. One battery will last 6 months of continuous usage with 500 daily presses, or up to 18 months in standby. 
Note how the battery can be easily removed from the remote.ShutterGrip™ 2 remote uses common CR2032 Lithium battery, and is user-changeable.
 
  ShutterGrip™ 2 can transform into a phone stand, setting up vertically or horizontally with ease. Note how ShutterGrip™ 2 transforms into a desktop stand, for live streaming or movie watching. With the ShutterGrip™ 2, you can play your photo albums, advance slides with the remote. You can binge watch your favorite shows at the perfect angle, or video call your friends, or host a live-stream, all handsfree. The list goes on. Best of all, when you are all done, everything folds neatly into a single compact palm grip, fitting into any pocket.

Out of the value of “Tech for People”, We were so eager to find out : what keeps consumers like you from using AR headsets? After a lot of surveys, we found that there are mainly two reasons: </p><p>1. AR headsets are too expensive (Normally $2-3K) </p><p>2. Very few AR contents are out there. </p><p> </p><p>In September of 2018, we started the project of a truly consumer-friendly AR headset: <strong>DreamGlass Air</strong>. To address the two problems above, We wanted to make DreamGlass Air with a price in the $200-$300 range , and compatible with most entertainment platforms you already have: Smartphones, Tablets, Consoles (PS4, Xbox, Switch), PC&amp;Mac, Drones, etc. So you will never worry about available contents again.</p><div data-id=""26148862""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1568220662/d0vqjb6eko34hckptbmb.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>We started our industrial design in Nov 2018, and prototyping in early 2019. There have been many iterations on PCB assemblies and also mechanical parts. It was not easy. But the harder part is on the software. To seamlessly play contents from so many different platforms in AR, we must do some digital manipulation on the contents received. For our Gen 1 product, we provided to our developer an SDK to do it. But this time, for regular consumers, we cannot use any SDK. We need to come up an invisible layer of coding underneath those contents. After many failures, we succeeded in developing  a large set of low-level coding in the GPU(Graphics Processing Unit), solving this problem in the fastest and most efficient way. All contents will directly play without any extra work from you.</p><div data-id=""26194660""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1568220663/nmjmqizwcratvcifbtxj.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>In  the first half of 2019, we’ve been busy iterating and validating.

 Based on our extensive experience in optics, DreamGlass Air uses the most cutting edge imaging and coating technology with the widest field of view, delivering the most immersive and vivid visuals all the time! 
Did you feel eye strain after watching movie on your phone? It is caused by the near distance (~0.3 meter) and the intensive blue light of the phone screen. DreamGlass Air uses advanced optical technology to project contents at meters away,  and employs over 10 layers of special optical coatings to reduces blue light and glare,  delivering much more comfortable viewing experience. 
  
 We really appreciate the help from our backer community, and we value your inputs. That’s why we seize very opportunity to meet our backer in person, showing live demos to him/her, and collecting feedbacks.Our CEO, Kevin Zhong, met Eliah in Los Angeles on Aug 25th. Eliah is a retired professional gamer, and a super backer who has backed 233 projects on Kickstarter in the past. Eliah liked DreamGlass Air very much and provided a lot of constructive suggestions.On Sep 7th&8th, we also met with 5 of our backers, Kevin, Glen, Mario, Ben and Krystyn in the Silicon Valley Innovation & Entrepreneurship Forum. They all tried our DreamGlass Air and Pro in person, and they all liked it. We'll inform you once we have more opportunities to meet with you in the future. Stay tuned!  
   DreamWorld was founded in Silicon Valley during 2016 by a group of AR enthusiasts who have had over 20 years of optics and computer vision experiences among us. Believing in the value of ""Tech for People"", DreamWorld strives to deliver the most cutting-edge yet affordable Augmented Reality technology to everyone.  After 2 years of R&D and manufacturing planning, in June of 2018, we launched our Gen 1 product, DreamGlass. As a responsible team, we managed to ship the product to thousands of customers in the same month. Our hard work paid off. Customers love us and our AR headset was rated as the Top 5 innovative AR products in 2018 together with Apple and Magic leap products. And our CEO, Dr. Zhangyi Zhong, was selected as the Top 30 leaders in AR together with Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft Executive Alex Kipman.   Dreamworld is a frequent exhibitor at CES, AWE, SID and many other conferences as well as trade shows. Our products were liked and appraised by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, and many other happy customers. Our current customers are mainly enterprises, studios, and universities. Out of the value of “Tech for People”, We were so eager to find out : what keeps consumers like you from using AR headsets? After a lot of surveys, we found that there are mainly two reasons: 1. AR headsets are too expensive (Normally $2-3K) 2. Very few AR contents are out there.  In September of 2018, we started the project of a truly consumer-friendly AR headset: DreamGlass Air. To address the two problems above, We wanted to make DreamGlass Air with a price in the $200-$300 range , and compatible with most entertainment platforms you already have: Smartphones, Tablets, Consoles (PS4, Xbox, Switch), PC&Mac, Drones, etc. So you will never worry about available contents again. We started our industrial design in Nov 2018, and prototyping in early 2019. There have been many iterations on PCB assemblies and also mechanical parts. It was not easy. But the harder part is on the software. To seamlessly play contents from so many different platforms in AR, we must do some digital manipulation on the contents received. For our Gen 1 product, we provided to our developer an SDK to do it. But this time, for regular consumers, we cannot use any SDK. We need to come up an invisible layer of coding underneath those contents. After many failures, we succeeded in developing  a large set of low-level coding in the GPU(Graphics Processing Unit), solving this problem in the fastest and most efficient way. All contents will directly play without any extra work from you. In  the first half of 2019, we’ve been busy iterating and validating. To collect feedback, we have shown demos of DreamGlass Air to hundreds of people in AWE (Augmented World Expo) and SID Display week, . Now we are doing some final optimizations and will start the the trial production right after the campaign ends. The fund raised with your help will enable us to order all the materials for mass production happening in November. We have many years of manufacturing experience and we have shipped products in high volume before. We are confident that we will produce and ship DreamGlass Air quickly, just as what we did for our Gen 1 product. DreamWorld will live up to your trust! Last but not the least, let’s talk about something bigger. Everyone knows 5G is just around the corner and as 5G’s most immediate application, AR’s potential is going to be fully revealed. As the future mobile platform, AR is going to completely change how we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves.  We believe AR should not be luxury and want to make AR accessible to everyone.

With the high output of 65W, it can charge a Macbook Pro
 Useful specs: equipped with 2 x USB-C ports (Power Delivery 3.0) and 1 x USB-A port (supports Quick Charge 4.0) 
Devices with USB-C have become widespread, and it has been adopted for many devices such as the latest iPhone, Android devices, tablets, PC, games, electronic cigarettes, etc.We are sure that CIO 2C1A Charger can become one of the most indispensable adapters since the USB-C port has become mainstream. Our adapter uses GaN (Gallium Nitride), a next-generation semiconductor technology.This adapter combines three important points, made possible by GaN technology: compact, powerful, and with multiple ports.  A Tiny & Powerful Adapter at 1/2 the Size of a Credit Card High Output and Compatible with Multi-Port ChargingWith CIO 2C1A, we are confident that you will save charging time, cut down on space used for chargers, and so free up space for carrying other things that are important to you. It will help reduce the clutter and help you have a more enjoyable and convenient daily life.   CIO Co., Ltd. has been featured in: AC Adapters: Recent DevelopmentsThe number of AC adapters that support quick charge technology, such as Qualcomm Quick Charge and Power Delivery, have increased along with smartphones and tablets that support this technology.Furthermore, GaN enables a suppression of the surface temperature of the AC adapter, which has succeeded in making it compact. Since 2019, AC adapters with GaN have appeared one after another.On the other hand, a lot of AC adapter manufacturers stick to the title “the world's smallest,” but they make GaN AC adapters with a single port.Of course, being compact is one of the most important factors, but when we thought about what we really needed rather than pursuing compactness, we came up with an answer.“A small charger which can supply optimal power to any device, and charge multiple devices simultaneously” Feature 
 Extremely high output: Single port 65W Output
 Multiple ports: 2 x USB-C, 1 x USB-A ports
Extreme compact with GaN
45W + 18W specifications that can charge smartphones and a Macbook at the same time
USB-A supports Quick Charge 4.0, up to 30W
 This provides incredibly high power and overall convenience with the same size as current AC adapters. CIO 2C1A is able to output 65W, at maximum, with a single port. Not only Macbook Pro, but also other devices such as Laptop / PC, Nintendo Switch, iPhoneXS, Android (Galaxy) can be charged at the maximum speed.  Power can be supplied at 65W output, which is enough to supply power to 50% to a Macbook Pro in only 39 minutes. Support Multiple PortMultiple units can be charged since it has multiple ports, not just one. While charging a Macbook with 45W output, it can also charge an iPhone11 at the maximum speed of 18W.USB-A output supports up to 30W Quick Charge 3.0Although the number of USB-C compatible devices is increasing, there are still many USB-A compatible cables and devices. This is compatible with Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and supports up to 30W output.Our wall charger is able to charge devices which do not support QC since it also supports 2.4A output. So it can charge each device at the maximum output. 3 Units - Simultaneous ChargingSince each device supports a different type of charging, it is ideal to have multiple ports on AC adapters.CIO 2C1A is able to charge your iPhone and Airpods while charging your Macbook.High quality and overwhelming compactness with GaN CIO 2C1A is equipped with GaN (Navitas NV6115 chip). It realized overwhelmingly compact, power-efficient and excellent heat resistance.  The difference in size is obvious. Compared with Apple adapter with 61W output, our charger is under 1/2 the size. Also, it is 1/2 size of a credit card. The Apple adapter has only one USB-C port, of up to 61W, while CIO 2C1A has 2 x USB-C (up to 65W) + 1 x USB-A (QC4.0 30W compatible)  CIO 2C1A fits in your pocket. It is the perfect size for carrying around. Adopting a stylish, long design, it fits very well in the side pocket of a bag, and is not only ideal for travel, but also at home and at work.   Specifications Design ConceptWe added a little dent on the side so that it will fit in your hand and be easy to remove it from the outlet plug.The edges are chamfered to prevent other devices from being damaged even when it is in a bag. The built-in foldable plugs (Plug Type A) can be ready to use with only one hand.   Designed not to interfere with other outlets  Designed to keep the thickness within 33.8mm (30mm) so as not to get in the way of other outlets. This way, this wall charger and other electronic devices will not interfere with each other.  ColorsTwo stylish and simple colors are available.They will suit any place and scene and cut down on outlet space used for chargers    Introduction of ToughLine, PD compatible cable (Charging Cable) Tough Line is a cable that can charge USB-C devices such as Apple devices, Android devices, Macbook, Laptop, Nintendo Switch etc at the maximum speed. This wall charger is able to supply power at the highest speed. (MFi-certified Model: CIO 0104, CIO 0105) SMARTCOBY10000: Credit card size, compact 10000mAh power bank  This campaign was on Kickstarter until December 23, 2019.Compatible with PD 18W so SMARTCOBY can be fully charged in just 3 hours.While using Wall Charger's first USB-C port for another device at 45W, its second USB-C port can be used for SMARTCOBY at 18W, at the maximum speed, so it is very convenientProof of ConceptWe recently demonstrated a working prototype of it and shot the following video.  Project ScheduleSeptember 2019　Initial Product ConceptionOctober 2019 　Product DesignNovember 2019 　Prototype CompletedDecember 2019 　 Final TestingJanuary 2020 　 Kickstarter LaunchedMarch 2020    Indiegogo LaunchedApril 2020      Begin ManufacturingMay-June 2020 　Reward Shipped to all Backers  Thoughts on This Project""I want a high output AC adapter."" ""I want a multi-port AC adapter."" ""It is okay as long as the AC adapter is compact."" CIO Co., Ltd., as a charger manufacturer, has been striving to reflect these thoughts on products every day.Meanwhile, by using GaN, it can suppress heat even while the adapter becomes more compact, and it is now possible to manufacture high-spec, and safe, AC adaptersWhile overseas manufacturers are releasing AC adapters that make full use of GaN technology, Japanese manufacturers were reluctant to step into the latest technology.We, CIO, want to manufacture and release the ideal AC adapter, based on the experience and opinions we learned from our Japanese customers, who we have been selling chargers to for many years. We want to deliver more convenient and safe products.By using our charger, we want you to realize the differences in specifications of AC adapters and how useful light, fast and multi-functional AC adapters can be.It will be a trigger to pursue your life in a more convenient way by space-saving and reducing charging time.This project was started with that thought. Our TeamCIO LLC was founded in 2017, operating mainly at EC malls such as Rakuten and Yahoo  Shopping in Japan.

Keep all of your gadgets plugged into Topwork, and then just use its built-in Type-C cable to hook up your laptop or tablet. This allows you to switch your whole desk setup from one laptop to another by just moving one cable. Not only saves your money but TopWork also greatly enhances your work efficiency. TopWork, your wonderful work companion and a must-have for work from home!(Might not be suitable for type-c tablets with keyboards, for the USB-C 3.1 cable length is limited)

 
 
 

TopWork is equipped with 11 desirable ports that all transfer data at full speed and hook up an ideal range of peripherals in a sturdily built. It can connect to your monitor, power, drive, mobile devices and much more all at once, such as the mouse, keyboard, memory cards, table printer, projector, etc.

The Type-C port supports both PD-100W blazingly fast speed charging. You will never encounter the power drain in your work time.

Not only does TopWork raise your monitor to exactly the right height for video conferences or movies, it also features a 3.5mm audio jack for wired listening and optimal audio quality to improve your entertaining experience.

Ports of HDMI @ 4K and VGA @ 1080P can be used simultaneously to expand 2 extra different display screens, which is very good news especially for programmers, designers and photo/video editors. Additional monitors definitely mean improved work efficiency while multi-tasking. 


No massive dongles, chargers, cables, and laptop stand needed. All you need is an all-in-1 workstation. TopWork brings you back to minimalism.
The built-in Type-C cable can be fixed on the slots under the bottom side of the base for neat storage.
Extended cable, designed for the Type-C port on the right side of the laptop.
 
There are 4 adjustable angles that can fit your need. TopWork gives you a healthy work posture. With that, you can not only improve the work efficiency, but also say goodbye to the sore neck, back pain, and other “computer pains”.
 
 
 
Avoid laptop overheat. It helps with heat dissipation. Don’t worry about overheating even when you put your laptop on your lap.
 
TopWork’s retractable wireless charging pad provides a drop-n-charge spot for your phone or AirPods when you are working around this workstation. Simply place them on the pad when they are not in use, and TopWork will always keep them charged and ready for use next time.

If you often go from the desk to a couch or the bed and around and around, you may find TopWork very comfortable and convenient. Using TopWork as a lap desk helps you work on the bed and the sofa at a healthy posture for a long time without the overheat burning your laps.

The luxury ultra-thin minimalist wallet from Airo Collective. The Stealth Carbon is packed with the strongest material technology known to man so that your wallet will never stretch, the edges won't fray, and will look great for years.It’s all about carrying what you need without any unnecessary clutter.   We are Airo Collective. Last year, we launched the world’s thinnest wallet — the Stealth Razor. It uses a material 15x stronger than steel, was as thin as a razor (literally), and could hold 8 cards and cash.After raising over $600,000, we successfully delivered over 12,000 wallets to over 10,000 happy backers. Since then, we’ve received over 1,000 reviews with an average 5-star rating.Now, we’re back with two new, upgraded, luxury, ultra-thin Stealth Wallets boasting the highest quality, strongest materials on Earth — the Stealth Carbon and the Stealth Diamond Wallet.Stealth Carbon is innovatively engineered to stay ultra-thin while carrying all your wallet essentials. Hold up to 8 cards and 6 bills securely and easily without creating a bulge in your pocket. The two card slots hold up to 4 cards each. Leave old receipts and unwanted business cards behind.They feature a quick-slide cutout to access your favorite cards quickly and an ID window to easily display your ID without taking it out. Enjoy a perfect balance of optimized minimalism with full functionality and ease of use.A durable ballistic cash bungee is a modern improvement of the money clip. The pull-tab keeps your bills from ever falling out.Don't worry about it breaking - our custom bungee took over a year of development to be extra strong with longevity in mind.Stealth Carbon is extremely lightweight and incredibly durable. The exterior TPU-infused 3K carbon fiber weave uses the highest quality carbon fiber in the world. Carbon fiber has been used before—in supercars and race cars — but never in a design near this slim. The carbon fiber is specially woven to ensure flexibility and durability and can withstand hundreds of thousands of flexes in its lifetime.Our proprietary DNA (Diamond Nano Armor) Edge Coating protects the edges and keeps Stealth Carbon looking clean forever. Made of a special infusion of actual micro-diamonds (the hardest substance on the Earth), the coating is specifically formulated for maximum strength and durability. Stealth Carbon will stay STRONG for ages to come and will never fray at the edges.The interior layer is made of sustainably sourced premium quality Italian leather fused to fibers that are 15x stronger than steel. This ensures Stealth Carbon will never stretch and will always maintain its shape.Eliminate back pain caused by bulky wallets. Stealth Carbon is ultra thin, so it won’t bulge out of your pocket or cause stress marks on your pants and jeans.And unlike other “thin” wallets, Stealth Carbon STAYS thin even when packed with cards and cash for long periods of time. It doesn’t stretch and won’t wear out.Just because it’s strong, doesn’t mean it’s not comfortable. Stealth Carbon is incredibly flexible. It’s also so thin, you might forget it’s in your pocket! No more back aches sitting on a brick, Stealth Carbon gives you absolute comfort with beautiful function and unparalleled durability.The carbon fiber in Stealth Carbon intrinsically blocks out unwanted RFID scans. This protects your payment data and prevents any unwanted transmissions from your cards — all without disrupting the speed of use or thickness of the wallet. Plus, it looks pretty darn incredible.If you're seeking a tough-as-nails wallet with the same thinness, features, and beauty look no further than the Stealth Diamond. Stealth Diamond features material technology never before seen in any wallet ever made— making it the most advanced leather wallet on the market.It’s flexible, exceptionally durable, ultra-light, feels amazing, and looks incredible.This may well be the toughest leather in the universe — all in an ultra-thin wallet Made to last through all of life's adventures.Stealth Diamond is made of sustainably sourced, heavy duty, top-grain performance leather stitched and fused with a thread that is 15x stronger than steel.It's the first wallet ever to use this amazing leather engineered at the molecular level. The combination results in a wallet that is incredibly thin yet significantly more abrasion resistant than any other leather.The special nano-armor plating with a diamond pattern powerfully enhances the leather’s abrasion resistance and makes it exponentially more durable than normal leather — all without compromising flexibility. Quality is of utmost importance to us. That’s why both Stealth Carbon and Stealth Diamond wallets are 100% designed and manufactured in the USA. No shortcuts, no compromises — only quality craftsmanship from the best in industry.With an ultra-thin profile, essential capacity, luxury quality, functional design, and insane durability, this could be the last wallet you’ll ever want. Nano-technology and innovative materials ensure your Stealth wallet looks clean and stays new no matter what you throw at it or how long you’ve used it.  Once we have solidified each backers' fulfillment survey and pledges are shipping out, we will email every backer a tracking number, link to the carrier's website, and any other additional information. All international shipments will be sent out delivery duties and taxes unpaid and international backers can calculate the expected duties and taxes that may be assessed upon going through customs with this calculator here:https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/ . We design high-quality products built for adventure, durability, and extreme functionality.
