<h3>History in the room.</h3>
<p>On the night in June 2016 when I watched the first woman in US history accept the nomination for Presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, I felt like history was in the room. It was a great night for me and for so many others in my country. It was a big moment full of optimism, and I got to share it with so many people.</p>
<p>From a little girl, I've always been a big fan of history, and sharing it has been a source of great joy for me ever since.<strong> Learning about great and influential women throughout the past and in the present, and passing that on to people who also loved learning, has always been one of my favorite things.</strong> Watching Hillary Rodham Clinton take the stage, I wanted to pay my respect to those brave and bold women of yesterday, who lead the way, and the ones continuing to make waves today to influence the amazing young women of tomorrow.</p>
<p>It was almost 100 days from that night until Election Day, and I thought<strong> </strong>""what a perfect number."" The idea struck me to draw a portrait of one historically important woman every day, and the #100Women100Days began. Of course, I didn't want the project just to be for me, I wanted to share it with the world. When I sat down to make a list of the faces I would draw, I saw an opportunity for me to learn more about the women who shaped the world, so I put out a call for suggestions. <strong>And the suggestions flooded in.</strong></p>
<p>Hundreds of names filled my mentions and my inbox, and I dove into the internet to learn more about the names and faces and deeds, some of whom I'd never known. I knew I could never make a list of the 100 most important women in history, so <strong>I made a list of women I admired, a sample of the strength and brilliance women have carried throughout humanity</strong>.</p>
<p>Even before the project was complete, I got messages asking about books and prints and whether I would do a poster of the finished project. While a book was too ambitious for the little time I had, I sold a few individual prints and postcards, but I was still getting requests for #100Women100Days posters.</p>
<h3>So here we are.</h3>
<p>I'm seeking funds to print posters of the 100 Women 100 Days project. Each <strong>24”x36” color poster</strong> contains all 100 images from the series, available individually or in sets of 2 and 5 for gift-giving. <strong>I'm also using the funds to print extra posters to donate to schools and libraries</strong>, or anywhere young people might have a thirst for history. I'm hoping to bring this project into living rooms, bedrooms and classrooms, for anyone who wants to celebrate this corner of women's history with me, and to help pass on a love of history to the next generation, maybe to spark the same kind of wonder that inspired me as a curious child eager to learn more.</p>
<p><i>One special note, after completion I discovered new information about one of the women, Aung San Suu Kyi, which made me uncomfortable including her in the series. No prints have been made available of this image, and she is being replaced in this poster by Septima Poinsette Clark, the unsung ""Mother"" of the Civil Rights Movement.<br/><br/>Schedule of Stretch Goals:</i></p>

My name is Paul Martin and I am a tig welder/fabricator from Garner, NC. This is a big step for me to put all this out there, but I've hit a rough patch and had to sell my metalworking equipment in order to pay bills and feed my family. Now that things are back in a positive light, I have no funds to be able to purchase a welder and continue making my art. My tig welded weld art has been my therapy ever since I learned to strike an arc. It's a release to focus all my grief, anxiety, anger, and depression into a piece that makes me smile. In 2008, after three deployments to Iraq, I attempted suicide numerous times to battle my nightmares and anxiety, depression,grief, loss, hallucinations of losing a fellow Marine. I spent a long time in programs for PTSD and psychiatric wards to get my head to where it is today, and through the help of a psychiatric service dog and my loving wife. She has been my rock and my saving grace. My wife pushed me towards my goal of going to college and learning how to weld. I make this artwork as a means of therapy, but also I sell it online and to friends.  I miss a lot of work due to my medical problems, which include pituitary tumor with growth hormone deficiency, thyroid goiter, sciatica, migraine, osteoarthritis, chronic bronchitis, but mostly due to my anxiety and depression. It's hard to leave the comfort of knowing I am safe and can watch my surroundings safely from my home. No strangers to just show up and get all in my personal space. Which is why i need an at-home tig welder. Not only will it be a means of therapy, but a means to supplement my income when my symptoms flare.

<p>Le <b>festival l'Underground de Waterloo</b> a pour but d’aider et promouvoir la <b>relève artistique Québécoise</b> en offrant aux groupes de la scène <b>rock et métal</b> l’occasion de performer lors d’un festival et ainsi avoir plus de visibilité. Nous offrons également la chance à ces groupes de performer devant d’autres gens actifs dans le milieu du show-business leur permettant ainsi d’élargir leur réseau de contact et d’acquérir des outils supplémentaires qui les aideront tout au long de leur carrière. De plus, étant sensibilisé à la situation socio-économique de Waterloo, nous désirons faire de ce festival un événement récurant et <b>gratuit</b> pour les gens de la région. Nous souhaitons ainsi donner une visibilité supplémentaire à la ville et à ses commerçants. Ayant remarqué un intérêt certain pour la musique à Waterloo au cours des dernières années, nous croyons que d’exploiter ce filon permettra à la ville de renforcer son identité et d'attirer les touristes.</p>
<p>Au cours de la journée, entre 13h et 23h, <b>12 bands</b> joueront sur la plage municipale de Waterloo à tour de rôle. Sur le site, il y aura des boissons et de la nourriture disponible pour ne pas que les festivaliers s'éloignent du site. Bien entendu, la plage et les jeux d'eau sont également disponibles, juste en face de la scène, ce qui permets aux festivaliers de se baigner tout en profitant du spectacle!</p>
<p>Puisque <b>le festival est gratuit</b> et que l'organisation ne souhaite pas faire de profit directement, nous avons besoin de votre aide pour financer ce beau projet!

I tattoo in a 400 square-foot loft, which leaves all 800 square-feet downstairs available for multiple uses. I host yoga classes (taught by Amber Grafe with Grounded Wellness) during the week, but currently have WAY too much empty wall space. This is where my Indiegogo campaign comes into play!<br/><br/>This campaign is to raise money to transform that empty wall space into an official art gallery. I believe that this is every artist's dream, and successfully funding my campaign will make it possible for me to achieve a lofty career goal: creating and displaying fine art in the same space that gets paid for by my real job. The gallery will host art shows with work from myself and other talented members of my family as well as local guest artists, with opening receptions held on full moon open studio nights at the Metal Arts Village every month.<br/><br/>Contributions to my Indiegogo campaign will fund the furniture, renovations, and equipment needed to transform the studio space. $5,500 covers sixty feet of track lighting with twenty track heads and LED bulbs, custom storage units, an eight-foot wall partition, a reception table, signage, and hopefully any unexpected costs that crop up. Additional funds will help me build a small screen printing workshop in the back of my studio for future artwork.<br/><br/>In return for your contributions, you get to choose from the following perks:<br/><br/><ul>

Before working at the Metal Arts Village, I operated a small gallery in downtown Tucson in addition to having a separate tattoo studio. I loved hosting shows and being part of the Tucson art community, but the space was not ideal for my combined needs and the challenge of running two separate studios was too much for one person. I was sad to leave my downtown gallery, but I'm excited to now have this opportunity to kill two birds with one stone under a single roof within a supportive community (and kick-ass space) where I truly and finally feel at home.<br/><br/>A contribution to this campaign is a contribution to local art.

<p>Hello, my name is Sushmita Mazumdar and I am an artist and founder of <a href=""http://www.StudioPause.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Studio PAUSE</a> in Arlington, VA, a space where I write, teach, and create Handmade Storybooks and other mixed-media work. Launched in 2013 with a Kiva Zip micro loan and in collaboration with <a href=""http://www.ewint.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Empowered Women International</a>, the Studio is also where I invite everyday people to explore creativity and celebrate community. <br/><a href=""http://www.studiopause.com/projects/thouart"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Thou Art: The Beauty of Identity</strong></a>, is an artist's book inspired by experiences of the Studio community and Afghan artist Sughra Hussainy, whose work is on display in the Freer|Sackler exhibition <a href=""http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/current/turquoisemountain/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Turquoise Mountain: Artists Transforming Afghanistan</a>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488666270/nffeupnh2z1yvntrfuro.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>Photo, above: Sushmita, Sughra, and Oakridge Elementary School teacher Dawn Amin-Arsala, at the exhibit where Sughra's art is displayed.</i></p>
<h3>
<strong>The Project—Thou Art: The Beauty of Identity</strong> </h3>
<p>This project is important to me because I believe it is up to each person to be who they want to be and we have to teach ourselves to accept that. I want people to see how each of us is so much more complex and beautiful than just what we look like or what our name may tell.  Read the whole story in the post I wrote for the Freer and Sackler Galleries blog <strong><a href=""http://bento.si.edu/events/exhibitions/art-must-bring-change/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Art Must Bring Change: A Turquoise Mountain-Inspired Project</a>. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488970926/qp7frnbiyuasjxktpdn0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>The Team—Artists, Poets, &amp; You!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sushmita Mazumdar</strong> got her BFA from Bombay University in India. After working 10 years in the advertising industry there, she moved to the US and continued her work as an art director. Along the way, she started writing stories from her childhood and making them into Handmade Storybooks for her children so they could understand their mother, who was from a different culture. Since then, she has created many unique storybooks, and worked with museums, schools, art centers, and libraries in the region teaching children, families, and seniors how to tell their stories by making them into creative and fun handmade storybooks and sharing stories of heritage and migration through art.</p>
<p><strong>Sughra Hussainy</strong> is a visual artist from Kabul, Afghanistan. She specializes in miniature painting, calligraphy, and illumination. Both of Hussainy’s parents were illiterate but infused the value of education in her and her siblings. When her parents died while Hussainy was a young girl, art became her solace. As Sughra said when she met the Studio writers, Art Must Bring Change and so in this, her first collaborative project, she wishes to give everyday people in America access to her art so they can see a different side of Afghanistan through it while she herself gets to see a whole new world through their poetry. Sughra believes that “while the body needs food to live, the soul needs art.""</p>
<p><i><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488665094/bexzlkefsbzd1wgxykan.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong><br/>Photo above: Sughra meets the Studio community at Writing Pause session, Studio Pause, Oct 2016</i></p>
<p><strong>25 Poets </strong>created a rich collection of identity poems spanning ages 14 to 81, racial/ethnic backgrounds, and religions, all who currently live in or around the D.C. area. The writers range from first-timers to pros, students to retirees, and artists to lawyers. Sushmita launched the project in Oct 2016 when the writers (most did not call themselves poets!) met with Sughra at the studio and had 3 free Writing PAUSE sessions to encourage them to write, with feedback and guidance from Studio member and project poetry advisor Courtney LeBlanc.</p>
<p><strong>And You </strong>will help get this unique book out into the community, giving people a chance to learn about others in their own words and through their own art. We hope the project will inspire people to share their stories, art, and poems, accepting each other with all our differences. So <strong>donate</strong> to this campaign and become part of this community. You can also  <strong><a href=""http://www.studiopause.com/projects/thouart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pre-order</a> your copies</strong> of Thou Art from the StudioPause website!</p>

<h3>Your Donations Will Allow Us To:</h3>
<ol>
<li>MAKE FREE BOOKS: We are making a 100-copy edition of the handmade book Thou Art: The Beauty of Identity selling them for $35. But we want to give every buyer <strong>2 for the price of 1</strong>—one to keep and one to give because we don't know who needs to have this book. Yet, we want it to be <strong>affordable</strong> <strong>for all</strong> so your donations will <strong>pay for everybody's second copy</strong>.</li>
<li>MAKE QUALITY ART AFFORDABLE FOR THE POETS: Each poet will pay <strong>what they can</strong> for the original artwork done by Sughra for their poem. The rest will be paid for by your donations because I strongly believe that quality art should be accessible to as many people as possible. Come see the artworks at our show! When I told Sughra that some of the poems have hurt and anger she said, ""Don't worry. We will make them beautiful with our art.""</li>
<li>CREATE A VIDEO: A video will be produced to document the project, let you <strong>hear</strong> <strong>the poets reading</strong> their work, and see close-up the art and book even if you don’t have a copy of it.</li>
<li>SPREAD THE PROJECT: I already have others interested in the project but <strong>not everybody has a budget</strong>. Your donations will enable us to take this and spread the project to many other communities. </li>

Launched in 2013 with a Kiva Zip micro loan and in collaboration with Empowered Women International, the Studio is also where I invite everyday people to explore creativity and celebrate community. Thou Art: The Beauty of Identity, is an artist's book inspired by experiences of the Studio community and Afghan artist Sughra Hussainy, whose work is on display in the Freer|Sackler exhibition Turquoise Mountain: Artists Transforming Afghanistan. 
Photo, above: Sushmita, Sughra, and Oakridge Elementary School teacher Dawn Amin-Arsala, at the exhibit where Sughra's art is displayed.

The Project—Thou Art: The Beauty of Identity 
This project is important to me because I believe it is up to each person to be who they want to be and we have to teach ourselves to accept that. I want people to see how each of us is so much more complex and beautiful than just what we look like or what our name may tell.  Read the whole story in the post I wrote for the Freer and Sackler Galleries blog Art Must Bring Change: A Turquoise Mountain-Inspired Project. 
The Team—Artists, Poets, & You!
Sushmita Mazumdar got her BFA from Bombay University in India. After working 10 years in the advertising industry there, she moved to the US and continued her work as an art director. Along the way, she started writing stories from her childhood and making them into Handmade Storybooks for her children so they could understand their mother, who was from a different culture. Since then, she has created many unique storybooks, and worked with museums, schools, art centers, and libraries in the region teaching children, families, and seniors how to tell their stories by making them into creative and fun handmade storybooks and sharing stories of heritage and migration through art.
Sughra Hussainy is a visual artist from Kabul, Afghanistan. She specializes in miniature painting, calligraphy, and illumination. Both of Hussainy’s parents were illiterate but infused the value of education in her and her siblings. When her parents died while Hussainy was a young girl, art became her solace. As Sughra said when she met the Studio writers, Art Must Bring Change and so in this, her first collaborative project, she wishes to give everyday people in America access to her art so they can see a different side of Afghanistan through it while she herself gets to see a whole new world through their poetry. Sughra believes that “while the body needs food to live, the soul needs art.""
Photo above: Sughra meets the Studio community at Writing Pause session, Studio Pause, Oct 2016
25 Poets created a rich collection of identity poems spanning ages 14 to 81, racial/ethnic backgrounds, and religions, all who currently live in or around the D.C. area. The writers range from first-timers to pros, students to retirees, and artists to lawyers. Sushmita launched the project in Oct 2016 when the writers (most did not call themselves poets!) met with Sughra at the studio and had 3 free Writing PAUSE sessions to encourage them to write, with feedback and guidance from Studio member and project poetry advisor Courtney LeBlanc.
And You will help get this unique book out into the community, giving people a chance to learn about others in their own words and through their own art. We hope the project will inspire people to share their stories, art, and poems, accepting each other with all our differences. So donate to this campaign and become part of this community. You can also  pre-order your copies of Thou Art from the StudioPause website!
The Events—""Thou Art"" Inspires the Community!
Launch Party: Join us at Studio Pause on March 31st, 6-9 pm, to celebrate Thou Art and bring in National Poetry Month with Studio artist-in-residence Hanan Seid's Mic-Less Night, where you can share your poetry, art, and songs about Identity! You can also pick up your pre-ordered copies of Thou Art there.
 Photo above: Sughra visits Oakridge Elementary School, Oct 2016
A Public School Community Book: The project has already inspired an Arlington public school, Oakridge Elementary, to create a community poetry book of their own. We visited the school, met teachers and librarians. We will kick-off their book, We Are Poetry, at the school to inspire families to share their own poems! Join us on Tue, April 4, 7-8 pm.  We will work with the school community on their books March-June 2017. The books will be used as text in the 2017-2018 school year in 43 classrooms.
A Public Library Workshop: Arlington County Public Library has invited Sushmita and Sughra to teach families to make their own community poetry book inspired by Thou Art at their Arlington Poetry Fest. Families will make books and fill them with poems by Arlington poets. Join us Sat, April 8, 12-4 pm. More... Check out their Facebook event here!
A Local Church Art Show: The project will be featured in a show, Thou Art: Identity in Words & Color, and there will be a reception, reading, and bookmaking event at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Arlington. Join us on Sun, April 23, 3-6 pm. Plans are underway for congregants to share their poems too which they will make into a book of their own poems later in 2017. Show is on view April-June.

Your Donations Will Allow Us To:

MAKE FREE BOOKS: We are making a 100-copy edition of the handmade book Thou Art: The Beauty of Identity selling them for $35. But we want to give every buyer 2 for the price of 1—one to keep and one to give because we don't know who needs to have this book. Yet, we want it to be affordable for all so your donations will pay for everybody's second copy.
MAKE QUALITY ART AFFORDABLE FOR THE POETS: Each poet will pay what they can for the original artwork done by Sughra for their poem. The rest will be paid for by your donations because I strongly believe that quality art should be accessible to as many people as possible. Come see the artworks at our show! When I told Sughra that some of the poems have hurt and anger she said, ""Don't worry. We will make them beautiful with our art.""
CREATE A VIDEO: A video will be produced to document the project, let you hear the poets reading their work, and see close-up the art and book even if you don’t have a copy of it.
SPREAD THE PROJECT: I already have others interested in the project but not everybody has a budget. Your donations will enable us to take this and spread the project to many other communities. 


​
Some Production Details: 


Paper: The books will have a variety of colorful covers from Sushmita's collection of beautiful handmade papers from India that she has gathered over the years.

Pages: Sushmita collected the poems, designed the book, and gave the poems to Sughra to be painted. The artworks, with all the gorgeous illumination, are being photographed by studio member and project book advisor Yuri Long, and then Sushmita will create the pages of the final book design. She will print the pages on 100% recycled paper and bind each of the 100 books by hand in a Japanese stab-binding style in her studio. The books will be ready to go out in April 2017.​

Essays: The book will also feature essays by Courtney LeBlanc, poetry advisor for the project, and Yuri Long, book advisor for the project.

Bios: The book will also have bios of all the 25 poets so you can learn more about them. A gem that was revealed in the bios... so many of them haven't written poetry since elementary school! There will also be bios of the artists and their poems.

The Perks: 
 


$10 and Your Name in the Book: Every bit of support from the community is important and this donation gets your name in the book so every reader can know you were part of this.

$20 Thou Art Print: This puts your name in the book plus gets you a 8.5x11 print of Thou Art cover image shown above, printed on French paper, signed by Sughra and Sushmita. 

$30 Bookmaking Workshop: One bookmaking session for yourself, a friend, or donated for a contributing poet---which will get your name in the book! Pick from 2 locations in Arlington and 3 dates in April 2017 to make a copy of Thou Art: The Beauty of Identity and pick your color for the cover. See photos from one of Sushmita's bookmaking workshops at National Museum of African Art here.

$50 Golden Edition Thou Art Book: For those supporters who want to get their name in the book, plus get a special copy of Thou Art with a Golden cover.

$70 Poem with Custom Print: To celebrate National Poetry Month send in your poem of Identity and we will send you a custom print with your poem (20 lines or less) in an artwork from Thou Art. Your name will go in the book as well.

$150 Thou Art Book Reading: Bring Thou Art to your school, work, book group, etc for a reading, get your name in the book plus an 8.5 x 11 art print! 

$250 Original Artwork by Sughra: Send in your poem of identity (20 lines or less) and we will make you an original 8.5 x 11 artwork with illumination done by Sughra ready to be framed. Your name will also be added to the list of supporters in the book.

Even if we don't reach our goal the funds collected will go first to bring the books and art to the contributing poets, and complete the book project at the elementary school.

Artists, Poets, and Community Are Creating Impact!
2: The number of artists collaborating on this project, one from India and one from Afghanistan, encouraging the community to share poems on identity.
25: The number of poets who will be able to purchase their poems with art by a world-class Afghan artist, at an affordable price.
100: The number of copies of Thou Art I will produce by April 2017.
​200: The number of adults and children projected to attend the Arlington Library Poetry Fest where they will learn to make their own community poetry book by hand.
800: The number of students at Oakridge Elementary who will learn and celebrate the power of their community's voices through art.
We hope this will inspire more versions of Thou Art and there are already more in the works so stay tuned...
Why Do We Think We Can Do This?
Here is a list of community projects Sushmita has completed in the last few years:
Photo above: Arlington Arts' Cynthia Connolly and Sushmita Mazumdar with the Columbia Pike Recipes for You project, Columbia Pike Blues Fest, June 2016


2016 Columbia Pike Recipes for You - a project Sushmita did for Arlington county to showcase the food diversity of Columbia Pike Arlington. 12 restaurant owners were interviewed and their stories and recipes made into book pages. Over 400 people made their books at 7 events in 6 months! 

2015 Sushmita Awarded Arlington County Spotlight Grant: In this project, Freeing: An Artist's Book by Sushmita Mazumdar, Sushmita collected over 80 stories of language from the community, written by 7 year-olds to grandmothers, and is making them into a book of art. The goal—Freeing Stories from Language, Freeing Writing from Words, Freeing the Book from Expectations


2013 Studio Pause Launches in Arlington: Sushmita wanted to create a space in her neighborhood for everyday people to gather, share stories, make art, and be inspired by each other.  She stopped keeping track of how many people have been to the Studio (now in its second and bigger location!) where new art is showcased almost every month! 

2010 - Present Family Legends of Alexandria: A project of Living Legends of Alexandria which documents stories of community “legends” through photos and interviews, Sushmita uses Family Legends to teach children to interview family members, find “legends” in their lives and make their stories into handmade storybooks.

2008 - 2012 Family Memory Storybooks: The Smithsonian commissioned Sushmita to create a series of easy-to-do book projects designed to get families talking and creating art together to tell their stories of family and heritage. Over the years many videos were produced as well, and many teachers were trained to take these projects to their schools.


How Can You Get Involved?
I am so happy for all the enablers I have met in my life many of who have helped so much with this project already! So please join in this project in any way you can—our mission at the Studio is to encourage your creativity so go for it. Tell us where we can take this and how you would like to help. Email me your ideas. You can also just pre-order your set of Thou Art!
And I'd love to thank the community that made all this possible: Special thanks to Dawn Amin-Arsala (Teacher, Oakridge Elementary School), Jennifer Endo (Resident Services Director, AHC Inc), Carson Herrington (Curator, Center Gallery, Unitarian Universalist Church of Arlington), and Aliza Shiff (Arlington Arts).And the awesome Studio Pause community who helped make this project happen—Courtney LeBlanc, poetry advisor; Yuri Long, book advisor and photographer; Mary Louise Marino, Kara Billings, and Kori Johnson, Indiegogo campaign advisors; Susan Sterner and Tyrone Turner, film producers and photographers. 
Please share this project with your friends and networks. Indiegogo has some easy share tools so it should be a piece of cake.

<p>About four years ago, we created a series of posters based on eight different robotic planetary exploration missions. Over time, we’ve had to re-print Voyager after being out of stock for more than a year. Sputnik has been absent from the catalog for a few months now, and we are also running dangerously low on copies of Cassini, Curiosity and Mars Exploration Rovers. Doing a run of four designs at 20""x36"" all at the same time is quite costly. It could take months to just recoup the cost of production.</p>
<p>That’s where you come in!</p>

<h2>50+ YEARS OF ROBOTIC SPACE PROBES</h2>
<p>With the success of the new Cosmos series, Juno at Jupiter, probes exploring comets and asteroids and New Horizons on it’s way to another Kuiper Belt object — the public is excited again about deep space exploration. Additionally, the age of the internet has made data from various past missions easily accessible to the masses. From all corners of the globe, amateur imagers are re-working old data sets with the power of modern computing and generating new looks at faraway places without ever having to leave the ground. </p>
<p>Each of these missions represents the best of what human intellect can achieve and can also provide a nostalgic sense of pride. To many, Voyager was a big part living through the '80s with its tour of the outer solar system and Carl Sagan’s original Cosmos series. In the ’90s Galileo treated us to a thrilling tour of Jupiter and it’s exotic moons. Then Y2K served up Cassini at Saturn and three particularly robust rovers on Mars with two out of the three operating to this day. </p>
<p>We have noticed over the last few years, that there have been some beautiful designs by various artists covering themes such as Earth science, manned space missions, the planets, and astronomy. However, designs that focused specifically on any particular robotic planetary missions seemed to be almost non-existent. When you do find something — the designs are generally data-driven. The likes of which might be expected to grace the walls of a high school science lab, but not hanging prominently in one’s own living room. Well, we want to change that and here is how we did it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How were the missions selected? </h3>
<p><a href=""http://planetary.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Planetary.org</a> conducted a poll to select the most popular missions since Sputnik. The top eight choices were; Voyager, Cassini, Curiosity, Mars Exploration Rovers, Sputnik, New Horizons, Rosetta and Galileo. To thank the Society for all their help we also design one for LightSail 1 which was also used as the central reward in their own record-breaking LightSail Kickstarter campaign (funded on June 26, 2015). The 20x36"" screen prints from that campaign disappeared within 40 minutes, but a few were recently discovered and made available for purchase from the official Planetary Society Store [<a href=""https://www.chopshopstore.com/collections/planetarysociety"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">chopshopstore.com/planetarysociety</a>].</p>

About four years ago, we created a series of posters based on eight different robotic planetary exploration missions.

Sputnik has been absent from the catalog for a few months now, and we are also running dangerously low on copies of Cassini, Curiosity and Mars Exploration Rovers. Doing a run of four designs at 20""x36"" all at the same time is quite costly. It could take months to just recoup the cost of production.

The likes of which might be expected to grace the walls of a high school science lab, but not hanging prominently in one’s own living room. Well, we want to change that and here is how we did it.

How were the missions selected? 
Planetary.org conducted a poll to select the most popular missions since Sputnik. The top eight choices were; Voyager, Cassini, Curiosity, Mars Exploration Rovers, Sputnik, New Horizons, Rosetta and Galileo. To thank the Society for all their help we also design one for LightSail 1 which was also used as the central reward in their own record-breaking LightSail Kickstarter campaign (funded on June 26, 2015). The 20x36"" screen prints from that campaign disappeared within 40 minutes, but a few were recently discovered and made available for purchase from the official Planetary Society Store [chopshopstore.com/planetarysociety].
 
THE MANY REWARDS
20"" x 36"" Screenprints 
This is the central reward. Backers will be free to choose from 20""x36"" screen prints for all eight missions (see images above) and the FAQs below for more about Screen Printing.

Poster #1: Voyager

Poster #2: Cassini / Huygens

Poster #3: Curiosity

Poster #4: Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit & Opportunity)

Poster #5: Sputnik

Poster #6: New Horizons

Poster #7: Rosetta / Philae

Poster #8: Galileo
Each poster was screen-printed in a minimum of three colors by Vahalla Studios (best known for their work making show posters for bands like Phish, Wilco, Decemberists and many others).

Digital Prints
Shown above are examples of the digital prints. Voyager is shown at size MED (17""x22""), Cassini at SML (13""x19"") and two examples of the uncut 5.75"" x 10.5"" TINY 3-in-1 prints. All digital prints are museum quality and printed on archival paper from Red River with CONE SYSTEM color inks.


The Complete Sticker Set
The whole series in a 3""x3"" round format. Made of vinyl and good for indoor/outdoor use. See more at chopshopstore.com.

Voyager Grand Tour Sticker Sheet
While Pioneer did precede Voyager with new views of Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager gave humanity its first up-close view of nearly half the major bodies of the solar system. Set includes 13 kiss-cut stickers including Jupiter, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Saturn, Enceladus, Titan, Uranus, Neptune, Triton, the Voyager probe itself and the legendary Golden Record! See more at chopshopstore.com.

4x6 Framed
A 4""x6"" print framed and shipped ready to hang (or stand). Missions reformatted for this perk (so far) are Voyager (shown), Cassini, Curiosity & Sputnik. The frame is Ikea RIBBA and measures around 7""x9"", includes plexiglass.
T-Shirts
All tees will be made available in styles for Men and Women and screen-printed on Bella/Canvas brand t-shirts. Sizes for kids can be made available if there seems to be enough of a demand.

Voyager T-shirt
Voyager 2 holds the record for most celestial bodies observed in a single mission and Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to enter interstellar space. See more at chopshopstore.com.

Curiosity T-shirt
The newest member of the robotic Martian community of surface rovers. Considerably larger than it’s cousins Opportunity and Spirit, MSL packs a larger diversity of tools to conduct it’s search for past and present life on the Martian surface. Making the Curiosity rover more of a mobile laboratory than merely a rover. See more at chopshopstore.com.

Something Incredible (the Saturn Tee)
Our first tee featuring Saturn. You would think we would have covered this ground considering it is the jewel of the Solar System. That and we are sure something incredible IS waiting to be known. See more at chopshopstore.com.

Above Earth T-shirt
Featuring 23 historic missions that explored near-Earth space both manned, unmanned and sometimes monkeyed or The missions are spirally arranged in chronological order, starting with Sputnik (the first man-made object to be set in Earth orbit) to Space-X’s Eagle module. See more at chopshopstore.com.

Beyond Earth T-shirt
Featuring 23 historic missions of the various nations that traveled beyond Earth orbit to explore our solar system. The missions are also loosely arranged according to their some of their most notable destinations. The design includes some of the earliest missions such as the Soviet Union’s Venera 7 which was the first probe to soft-land on the surface of another planet to one of the newest members Juno at Jupiter! See more at chopshopstore.com.

Beyond Earth Screen Print
An impressive large-scale print with the same design as noted above with the exception of featuring Sojourner instead of Curiosity and Ulysses in the place of Juno (printed before those successful missions had arrived). Print is two color gray inks infused with a metallic silver on a black sheet of 19"" x 25"" French, Speckletone 80lb paper. See chopshopstore.com for more.
 

THANKS!
We would in particular like to thank The Planetary Society for their involvement in this project. I myself joined the society at age 12 — soon after reading Cosmos from cover to cover. So I am honored to have the Society assisting or campaign in the way it has.
Also, a specific shout out to Mat Kaplan and Planetary Radio for coming up with the idea to crowd-source the most popular missions in the first place.
To Jeff (aka Kleptonaut also on Sound Cloud) for always creating music that is perfect for my Kickstarter projects even before I have conceived of them.
And thanks to you for considering our project. I hope we will be sending you a print or two or three in December.
 
FAQ
Know More About the Printing Process
You can see more in the FAQ section on this topic. We cannot link in that section so this is in addition to the screenprinting question.
We designed and programmed this site in 2004 for The Metropolitan Museum of Art which explains the four classic print methods. It is also worth boasting that it has a permanent home in the museum as an educational kiosk. To see Screen Printing click the last box to the right. [What is a Print?].",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Quality of Life Crew would like to thank the Burning Man Organization for encouraging us to continue with our project. You may know our lead artist Josh Vaile/Koda Ringz has stepped away from the project to work on personal matters. We wish him well as he strives to find the same balance in his life he sought to symbolize in this art piece.</p>
<p>An art project never belongs to just one person. It is a conversation between collaborators and participants, between the past, present, and future. It requires communal input to realize its potential impact. This project does not belong to us; it belongs to you. We are grateful to have Burning Man’s continued support as our dedicated team of visionaries continue to move the project forward. Through our own metamorphosis as a team, this piece has become even more meaningful for us to bring to the playa to remind us how challenging – and necessary – finding balance is, and that we are not alone in that pursuit.</p>
<p><br/>Quality of Life is a large-scale wood and metal sculpture representing a flock of large migrating birds - moving forward, together, towards home. This migration is a symbol of the collaborative movement of nature and all of its processes. The birds are balanced on each other, connected and supporting each other, head to heart, symbolizing the connection and balance between the thinking and the feeling, the cerebral and the spiritual.</p>
<p>Atop the head of the smallest bird rests a large metal feather, integral to the structural balance of the piece. This represents the fragility of the balance we aspire to. This balance can often seem impossible. We do not always succeed. But we must believe we can; we must believe in the impossible.</p>
<p>Quality of Life honors both collaboration and the balance needed to support our own Quality of Life - individually, communally, locally, and globally. It is also a representative of the Burning Man community, which could not exist without collaboration. We work together to build, to sustain, to grow, and to change. We could not exist without each other. We touch, we think, we feel.</p>

<p>As we move forward, our biggest need is funding to complete the work we have begun. Our next fundraiser will be held at Jub Jub’s Thirst Parlor</p>

<h3>About the Artist (and the project!):</h3>
<p>My name is Rachelle Baker and I am a multidisciplinary artist hailing from Detroit, MI. I am extremely passionate about creating things, whether is be comics and zines, digital and traditional illustration, and pretty much any form of relief printmaking, I'm very much about it. Most of my imagery and work features women, with themes and tones ranging from sexuality, self image, relationships, emotional and mental issues, and the like.</p>
<p>With my current project proposed for this campaign,<strong> ""Lookin' Like A Snack... But You're The Only One Getting Eaten""</strong>, I want to create a series of 10-15 large scale drawings, paintings and prints of empowering, strong, amazing, diverse, and colorful babes talking back and kicking ass! Monster babes that will break you if you step to them talking that garbage, but I need a little help pulling it off, and that's where you come in!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Some things and stuff to make this project work (and what you get!):</h3>
<p>This project will be shown in October and it is a pretty large and ambitious project for me (to say the least). You'll be helping in a very large way to make this project a reality! </p>
<p>The funding for this project will be going to a few things which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Printmaking Studio Time</strong>: Because I don't have a printmaking studio of my own, I will be getting a membership at a local community print shop which will enable to expose screens and print with ease!</li>
<li>
<b>Tools and Materials</b>: I'll require ink, lots of paper (high quality archival rag is godly!), paint markers, canvas and wood!</li>
<li>
<strong>High Quality Digital Prints and Stickers: </strong>Making art affordable to anyone, no matter how much money they have is very important to me, so I will be having high quality prints made of all of my work for folks to purchase. Plus, everyone loves a good sticker.</li>
<li>
<b>Cool Wearables!</b>: Hand printed limited edition Tees and Totes will be made for this series by me!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you invest your time and money into this project, pretty much every perk is ART! Whether it be an art postcard, a hand drawn tote, a super cute sticker, or a custom tee to add to your (already awesome) t-shirt collection, you'll get a little bitty bit of the series to have at home with you and remind you that you really did that and made it happen!! All items will be super cute and made with love and eternal gratitude,</p>
<p>If my entire goal isn't reached, the show will still go on, just a little bit smaller than planned, but still as cute as planned!</p>
</div><div><p>One of the most important things I'd like to with this project is show more representation of WOC in printmaking and illustration. I would also like to cover subjects such as catcalling, self image, and body positivity in my work, bringing light to what goes on in our heads and everyday lives. By contributing, you'll be helping me to make images that I hope people will see themselves in and be encouraged to speak up, practice self care, and be care free!</p></div><div>
<h3>Help in a different way!</h3>
<p>Even if you can't afford to contribute right now, you may know someone who can or wants to! If you could share this or tell a friend, it would help immensely!</p>
<p>Thanks so much for taking your time to check this project out! I appreciate yoooou!!</p>

<div>Fungi are healing to both us &amp; the planet : </div>
<ul>
<li>They are decomposers, breaking down dead organisms, which in the web of life, allows for new organisms to grow. </li>
<li>As you might know, humans can also cultivate fungi. By cultivating them, we can introduce them into environments that are toxic for humans, and work towards remediation. They have an unbelievable ability to remediate soil &amp; water. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Humans don't know very much about fungi. We need citizen scientists to help tap into the magnitude of potential that lies under-utilized with fungi. </span></li>
<li>Fungi are often misunderstood. People think they are gross or poisonous or just used for ""tripping"". I feel it is extremely important to reframe the conversation surrounding fungi. Information about them needs to be more accessible, less strictly in academia, and more relevant to our everyday lives. </li>

<p>I usually describe a risograph as a cross between a screenprint &amp; a xerox machine. it is a beautiful way to mass produce printed matter, because it can only print one color at a time!! While this might seem annoying to those of us used to inkjet printing, it can result in some very interesting effects. by overlaying one color with a second color, we can create a tertiary color manually. </p>

Reishi mushrooms are said to prevent cancer. 

Death caps can kill you if consumed.  

Psilocybes can make you ""see god"". 
sometimes Stinkhorns look like slimy penises. 
Amanita muscaria are perhaps the origin of soma, a mystical & ancient Vedic ritual drink. 

_____________________________________________________________________________


earth-care/self-care : ethnomycology for everyone is a zine about a wide variety of experiences with enthomycology, which is simply the ways humans & fungi interact. 


I wrote, edited & designed together this collaborative effort from myco-nerds around the globe. I am a hobbyist mycologist, artist, photographer, & designer

""zines"" are just a shortened word for magazines or small-press publications (their origin being the riot grrrl movement - radical punk feminists in the 90's). they are a cheap & fast & effective & awesome way to spread knowledge.


'earth-care/self-care' is intended to be an introduction to fungi. It is a mixture of facts & personal accounts. It is accessible & interesting to a completely beginning mycologist or a professional one. 
It is my hope to give the reader an aesthetically beautiful, imaginative & insightful experience. all kinds of artwork await you. 


Tell me more about why I should care?
Fungi are healing to both us & the planet : 

They are decomposers, breaking down dead organisms, which in the web of life, allows for new organisms to grow. 
As you might know, humans can also cultivate fungi. By cultivating them, we can introduce them into environments that are toxic for humans, and work towards remediation. They have an unbelievable ability to remediate soil & water. 


Humans don't know very much about fungi. We need citizen scientists to help tap into the magnitude of potential that lies under-utilized with fungi. 
Fungi are often misunderstood. People think they are gross or poisonous or just used for ""tripping"". I feel it is extremely important to reframe the conversation surrounding fungi. Information about them needs to be more accessible, less strictly in academia, and more relevant to our everyday lives. 


Publishing details :
This first edition will be of 100 copies.
It is being printed on a risograph or duplicator machine. 
what is that, you ask? 
I usually describe a risograph as a cross between a screenprint & a xerox machine. it is a beautiful way to mass produce printed matter, because it can only print one color at a time!! While this might seem annoying to those of us used to inkjet printing, it can result in some very interesting effects. by overlaying one color with a second color, we can create a tertiary color manually. 
See an example of risograph printing : 



we need : $600 to pay the publisher. This includes printing on a risograph, paper, binding, the labor of the publisher, and shipping costs. 


The publisher we chose was the most cost-effective, yet high-quality quote that we could find in the US.


you'll receive : 



a copy of the zine if you donate $10 or more. 

by supporting 'earth-care/self-care', you will help inspire others to learn more about fungi, and the array of ways that humans can interact with them, especially for healing purposes. 



   the impact :


your contribution to the zine will enable others to learn about the potential for fungi to remediate & heal our environments & ourselves. it could motivate people to start taking walks, asking questions about biology, eating foods that they foraged, learning about fungal & plant identification - the list goes on. 
if I go over my indiegogo goal, I will be able to print an edition larger than 100!! the more the merrier! 



   other ways you can help :  Share this campaign on social media! 
Talk to your friends about fungi! Read more about why they are so incredible. Check out resources like Paul Stamets' TED talks, David Arora's books & Radical Mycology's website &  zine.

<h3>""A Transmaterial Body"":</h3>
<p>This piece is a durational transdigital performance wherein I will be connecting my body to digital space and digital space to my body through the use of biosensors, a local web server, and digital feedback. Participants in this work will be able to connect to a wifi network (localized around my body) and be prompted to seek me out in person. When they do, we will engage in a dialog in which I will ask them for personal data (secrets, memories, passwords, or etc.) and in exchange I will give them access to a web page, hosted on the aforementioned local wifi, containing a livestream of my personal biodata. I assembled the technical components in small (longest dimension 4 inches) container shown below:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This project is an exploration of how the prefixal trans can be leveraged to reexamine the boundaries of the body in an increasingly digitized and networked world. Specifically, how the material of the body might be transed through a reimagining of the corporeal as expanding into the realm of the digital an enlivening of the local digital spaces we inhabit. </p>
<p>This is an experimental performance which will change and grow throughout each performance, both in terms of my interactions with participants and in the technologies used. Because of this, the artist books created will be a unique opportunity to document the piece as it evolves over time.</p>

<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>I am an artist living and working in Madison, WI and graduate student at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I will be finishing an MFA in Art (4D) and an MA in Gender and Women's Studies in Spring 2019. ​</p>
<p>My art practice is strongly rooted in my experience as a transwoman. The act of transitioning, while a deeply personal process, is also a politicized act. The act of exploring my gender identity, as both a personal truth and a political gesture, informs my art practice. The experience of pushing back against gender norms as I have transitioned away from a binary gender identity, has instilled in me a perspective of gender that is fluid rather than fixed. Throwing into sharp relief the inadequacies of my learned perspective of gender as binary system. This can be seen as an entry point into my work; how a binary system of gender identity fails to describe our lived experiences with gender and puts non-binary people at risk of violence and discrimination.</p>
<p>Throughout my practice, intricate and deliberate systems (numerical and otherwise) are employed to create visual form, articulate data, and to allude to our habitual ordering of peoples and behaviors. Creating the works within a structured system allows for connections between the visual structure and the content of the of the work to speak to the social and political structures to which I am responding.</p>

<p>Born in a small town in Russia in 1990 (now based on Toronto, Canada), Lora was an artist from a very young age.</p>
<p>Though she didn't have being a professional exhibiting artist in mind, she drew and painted because of how it made her feel, and because it felt good to paint her ideas and feelings.</p>

</div></div>","Created by artist Lora Zombie, Sketchbook Challenge is an all-in-one creative journey that everyone can participate in and benefit from, at any skill level.
What if everyone made being creative a part of their daily life?
We designed the Sketchbook Challenge as an interactive creative journey, to help anyone expand their imagination, be more creative, find their inner child, and have FUN.
No matter your age, skill level, or occupation.
We designed this Sketchbook Challenge for YOU.
Step 1: Design the ULTIMATE sketchbook



Sketchbook Features & Details: Measures 6.75x8.5 inches (17x21cm), with 75 sketch pages, plus a bonus 18 color pages featuring Lora Zombie artwork and descriptions. Also included in a rear pocket are 3 stencils corresponding to challenges in the book, as well as a front pocket with a letter from Lora. The sketch paper is a premium weight, tested and approved for all mediums.
Step 2: Make it An All-In-One Creative Journey
Throughout the sketchbook are a series of 30 challenges to guide you through your own creative journey. Each challenge is designed to be about imagination, not technical skill. 
This sketchbook is about YOU.
Your imagination, yourself, it's designed to be a personal journey and escape.
Take a peek inside:
  
... and many more.

""Being Creative is, in fact, useful for our mental and physical well-being.""

""It might sound too good to be true, but simply engaging in creative behaviours improves brain function, mental health, and physical health.""

""Creative activities can relieve stress, aid communication, and help arrest cognitive decline""

We wanted to prove that ANYONE could have fun with the Sketchbook Challenge.

Born in a small town in Russia in 1990 (now based on Toronto, Canada), Lora was an artist from a very young age.
Though she didn't have being a professional exhibiting artist in mind, she drew and painted because of how it made her feel, and because it felt good to paint her ideas and feelings.

In the late 2000s Lora starting posting some of her work online on art forums. Encouraged by the positive response, she continued to paint and post her work. It started to circulate widely online, eventually reaching millions of people through blogs, news outlets, and social media.

Since then Lora Zombie has developed into a top seller on the urban art scene, her work has been seen, shared, and purchased by millions. Lora has exhibited solo in New York, London, Los Angeles, Toronto, San Francisco, Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, and St Petersburg.

Lora has also collaborated and worked with many of the worlds top brands in entertainment including Demi Lovato, JBL, Warner Brothers, Sony, Perrier, HBO and more.
Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Lora Zombie Studio aims to engage and inspire a global audience of artists, creative, and art fans.


We've worked for years inspiring people through Lora's artwork, delivering hundreds of thousands of prints, apparel, original artwork and more to homes in over 30 countries worldwide.
Now we are turning the creative table, challenging anyone to be more creative, and showing you how to do it.
We want to make the world more creative, we want everyone to experience the feeling of being an artist and expressing themselves creatively.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I’m Jef Bond and I put on an Art Party… Well, it’s more of a crazy, off the wall, blow your mind, Art Extravaganza!</p>
<p>So, 8 years ago I saw an amazing work of art on a friend’s wall.</p>
<p>“Whose piece is that?” I asked</p>
<p>“It’s mine.” He responded</p>
<p>“Wow…why is it not in the gallery with the rest of your stuff?” (Which was touristy)</p>
<p>“Well, that piece is considered too edgy for most of the galleries in our area.”</p>
<p><span>This was a bit frustrating because the dude was talented… I mean, REALLY talented. I started to hear similar stories again and again from other amazing artists. That’s when I decided to create The Art Party (NOT AN ART SHOW… an ART PARTY) to welcome the artists to create from deep within themselves and cultivating an environment that breaks every rule to the stuffy art show.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Over the years, Art Party has evolved into a huge event that brings artists and creatives of all kinds into one unique environment that is in itself a work of art, created by volunteers from the ground up.</p>
<p>We have insurance to cover the event and the people involved. We have set backs daily, we just roll with the punches, and find cures. Thankfully I've been fortunate enough to have a solid team helping me solve issues that have presented themselves up to this point. This is our tenth Art Party and from each and every one we have learned from our mistakes and successes to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Here is a list of supplies and costs involved with making this a mind blowing extravaganza!</p>
<p>Approximate costs for the 60,000 sq.ft.warehouse/venue: $4000<br/>Building Materials for our creative team and construction crew: $2000<br/>Cleaning Supplies: $200<br/>Rental Restroom Facilities: $1000 - $2000<br/>Design Materials: $5000<br/>Liability Insurance: $600 - $1200<br/>Coordinating Event Costs: $15,000 this includes all volunteer hours from the Art Party crew.<br/>Trash Disposal: $1000 - $2000<br/>Electricity for a month: $500 - $1000</p>

Thank you for donating whatever you can, for sending this to your friends and family who might be able to help (the share tools can be found below this post), and for supporting me in my decision and experience. Thank you for helping me be the happiest boy, to be who I was born to be, to be happy in my body and as myself. 

If you have any questions / comments / concerns, or just want to share some joy with me, I can be found at tuckfinnstrand@gmail.com. My blog is located at teeisfor.blogspot.com, where I will be documenting my experience and drawing comics about being trans and in my late early-twenties.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Logan Company and Kayla Herrmann have been planning and rehearsing a new piece since the close of their show at the Lincoln Center Institute last year. At 8pm on Thursday, May 10th and Friday, May 11th, in three pieces in two acts <strong>at the Hartt School in Connecticut</strong>, they will premier the piece that has culminated through this last year of planning.</strong></h3>
<p>Utilizing live music and movement performance, in<strong> <em>By Speed of Foot Fall: On Being Seen</em></strong> we explore the roles of the observed and the observer and come to recognize that these tendencies exist idle or active in us always. Before we ask/seek/move, possibilities are endless. How quickly can we transition between these two roles and how is it possible to harbor two perfectly opposite properties?</p>
<p>Also in this evening, there will be live classical music and the premier of a new solo by Logan Company director Kathryn Nusa Logan, <strong><em>Groovy, That's Lonely</em></strong></p>
<p>We believe firmly in our ability to self-produce our work. However, fundraising is a part of that process. The funds we raise from this campaign will go toward paying for:</p>
<p><em>Rehearsal space, costumes, press, travel, reception, photo and video documentation, light and stage design, and payment for the performing artists' time and efforts.</em></p>

<h3>My Goal:</h3>
<p>I need your help in gaining canvases and paint in order to have more art pieces to show in the upcoming Indian Wells Arts Festival, April 5th through the 7th, 2013.  I have been blessed at the age of 17 to be accepted into this art show, and to gain such an early title as an artist, but with the lack of money needed in order to further expand my showcase I find it extremely challenging to do so.</p>
<p>Basically I am searching for donations in order to buy more canvases, paints, and to rent a cabana for this show.  These supplies are <span>necessary</span> for me to build an inventory for display at this show.  Being included in this Art Festival will help me get my foot in the door for future shows and possibly art schools, which is my ultimate goal.</p>
<p>My name is Mason Taylor, and have been influenced by art for as long as I can remember.  Growing up and watching my grandfather, Terry Anderson, create masterpieces led me into my passionate love for art.</p>
<p>Your contributions will not only help supply me with the proper tools needed to further my collection of art, but will show how many people there are that enjoy art as much as I do, and feel it should be embraced in as many ways as possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Would Need From You:</h3>
<p>My goal is $1000, with this amount it would be a good threshold amount to have access to proper quality of canvas and paint to put to full artistic use.</p>
<p>All the money I earn will go to the art show, and only for art supplies in order to excel at a greater pace in acquiring the right materials for this project of mine.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What This Means To Me:</h3>
<p>For as long as i can remember, I haven't wanted to do anything as much as I love doing art.  It is my passion, and I feel it will be the one thing I excel most in life.  I am extremely greatful for this opportunity, being included in the Indian Wells Arts Festival will open more doors into my art career, and eventually, an academy for art students!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Simply get the word out that I need as much help as possible, and any recognition will be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your time!           -Mason T.</p>

<p><strong>IN SUMMARY |</strong> Situated at the intersection of conceptual art and music, UNCOLLECTABLE is a two-night performance that will combine elements of an art gallery reception and a musical experience. By highlighting the rising importance of sound art, UNCOLLECTABLE is a show that seeks to expand the vocabulary of songwriting. This multicultural performance will be kicking off a month-long art exhibit hosted at Soho’s <em>Hotel Particulier</em> and is being co-curated by Murtaza Vali, an independent Art Critic, Historian and Curator.</p>
<p>Pledge now to bring this idea to life. Help me raise $11,000; your donation will bring the performance to life; the art exhibit and eMagazine are already taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT I BELIEVE | </strong>By looking at trends outside the entertainment industry, musicians can breathe new life into the Middle East’s passive music and arts industry. By collaborating with sound artists or chefs (for example) we can introduce innovation and ideation into the music industry.</p>
<p><strong>IMPACT | </strong>By bringing sound art and music together, we can deepen the conversation about the future of indie music, particularly in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The principles driving UNCOLLECTABLE are supported by a robust PR program and content strategy that will ensure this work has impact. For example, arrangements are being made to convey findings to Mideast Tunes and Knooz Room. Moreover, these principles are brought to light in an eMagazine already published on ArteEast.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Participating </strong><strong>Performers</strong> | </strong>Joshua Liebowitz (artist), +Aziz, Matthew Halley, Sammi Ali, Jie-Song Zhang, Seif Al-Din, KRUSSIA (musicians)</p>
<p><strong>$11,000 COST BREAKDOWN | </strong></p>

<p>- Transportation Costs $1200</p>
<p>- Venue $1500</p>
<p>- Equipment $1500</p>
<p>- Props $500</p>
<p>- PR $1500</p>
<p>- Payment to sound artist TBD</p>
<p>- Remainder of money raised will be divided amongst the musicians</p>
<p>- Indiegogo/ Paypal/ the bank will scrape off a good 5-9%</p>
<p><strong>THE SPACE | </strong>Hotel Particulier is an art salon, an establishment where encounters, cross-pollination of ideas, disciplines and collaboration can take root and grow in a space that is different - and where there is a freedom of experimentation. It is a place of hospitality, of decompartmentalization, of conversations, and where not only artworks are exhibited but also ideas. Ticket prices for the event are TBD</p>

You may have seen us bringing a bit of magic to Perth beaches this year.  We pop up at beaches along the coast-line of Perth, Western Australia and splash around, say hi to children, blow bubbles, give out shells and generally spread a love for our oceans!

We are both aspiring artists and have been bouncing off each other for a number of years with all sorts of creative and crazy projects.</p><p>We were both water-babies as children. We grew up around the ocean and backyard pools and swam like it was second nature to us. We felt at home in the water. We were also children of the Walt Disney golden age and were completely captivated by The Little Mermaid.  We adored the ocean and were fascinated by ocean creatures.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/283370/files/20131229193454-1543160_758029007548521_88643356_n.jpg?1388374494"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>During Jessica’s final year of university she became interested in under-water photography and photographed Amelia as an underwater muse-like creature which would play a part in inspiring and transforming us both later on down the track.</p><p>Then one day a couple of years ago Amelia had an idea to make our childhood dreams come true whilst also fulfilling the dreams of children all around Perth; we would become mermaids! Since then it has been a bit of a whirlwind! Mermaid Amelia emerged from the depths briefly last year but then found out that she was expecting twin mer-babies! Her twin boys were welcomed into the world in August this year. It was then that Jessica overcame her characteristic mermaid shyness to join creative forces with Amelia so that we could work together to bring back the Mermaids!</p><p><b>Why We Need Your Help!</b></p><p>This has become part of our lives and has become our passion and we have been enthusiastically putting all of our own money into making our tails, creating accessories, gathering shells and transporting ourselves all around Perth to match that passion. Unfortunately this is putting pressure on our finances (Amelia is an artist and new stay-at-home mer-mum and Jessica is also an artist and works part-time in hospitality... under the sea of course!).</p><p>We hand-make and hand-paint our tails but the ocean and the sand are very hard on them and they are often worn and need repairing and repainting after almost every outing which takes more time and money. We have been doing a lot of research into how to create better quality tails and have found that Silicone tails are the best for ocean swimming and splashing!</p><p>We were very excited about trying to create this type of tail ourselves  and did lots of research and experimentation into the techniques that we needed to do this. We found that we both have the skills and know-how to create Silicone tails but frustratingly, many of the materials that we need to do this are unavailable in Australia and prohibitively expensive to import.</p><p>Below are a couple of examples of some of the repairs we have to do after each swim:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/283569/files/20131229233314-20131230_152709.jpg?1388388794"" src="""" style=""width: 586.667px;height: 440px;""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/283566/files/20131229233158-20131230_125247.jpg?1388388718"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><b>What We Want to Do</b></p><p> </p><p>We have decided that to keep the magic alive we need good-quality professional tails that will hold up to the wear and tear of swimming in the ocean, splashing in the sandy surf and sitting on reefs! We can’t get the materials to make them ourselves but we have discovered that there are fantastically talented artisans in America who make silicone tails and ship them all over the world.</p><p> We have been longing for these tails for a while and trying to work out how we could scrimp and save (and even what possessions we can sell!) to get us on the way to affording one. We have come to the conclusion that we can't without a little help!</p><p> </p><p>We would be so grateful if you could help us on the way to obtaining these tails. It would mean that we could keep doing what we are doing and make it part of our lives but also part of Perth going into the future! The time out of our days spent fixing and improving our current tails could be much better spent at the beach with you!</p><p>Your donations will also help towards transporting ourselves further around Perth so that we can get to see mermaid fans further North and South than we can currently get (those long swims are so tiring!).</p><p>Any overfunding means better quality tails and more energy to swim to further places. We would also like to be able to get better and more realistic scale tops and source more shells and goodies that we can give out at certain appearances.</p><p>If we don’t make our target any funds that we do make will go towards improving and repairing our current tails.</p><p><b>But Wait We Want to Give You Something Back As Thanks!</b></p><p>We have a number of things we will offer you to say thank you for your help. Our arty sides would love to give you a bit of mermaid creativity for you to keep.</p><p>$5 donations will be thanked with a photo and thankyou note (postage to Australia only).</p><p>$10 donations will be thanked with a 4x6” signed ocean-themed photographic print of artwork by Amelia or Jessica Pearl.

We will let you borrow one of our mermaid flippers and teach you how to swim like a mermaid. We will even take a few photos to remember the experience by. If you have a pool we can even take some underwater! We will even give the swimmer a gift to remember us by! Ideal for strong swimmers and pools. Adult supervision required.</p><p>If you live outside Australia and would like one of these perks please contact us and we will see how much extra the postage is.</p><p><b>The Future</b></p><p>We have lots of ideas about where this could take us in the future.

We found that we both have the skills and know-how to create Silicone tails but frustratingly, many of the materials that we need to do this are unavailable in Australia and prohibitively expensive to import.Below are a couple of examples of some of the repairs we have to do after each swim:    What We Want to Do We have decided that to keep the magic alive we need good-quality professional tails that will hold up to the wear and tear of swimming in the ocean, splashing in the sandy surf and sitting on reefs! We can’t get the materials to make them ourselves but we have discovered that there are fantastically talented artisans in America who make silicone tails and ship them all over the world. We have been longing for these tails for a while and trying to work out how we could scrimp and save (and even what possessions we can sell!) to get us on the way to affording one. We have come to the conclusion that we can't without a little help! We would be so grateful if you could help us on the way to obtaining these tails. It would mean that we could keep doing what we are doing and make it part of our lives but also part of Perth going into the future! The time out of our days spent fixing and improving our current tails could be much better spent at the beach with you!Your donations will also help towards transporting ourselves further around Perth so that we can get to see mermaid fans further North and South than we can currently get (those long swims are so tiring!).Any overfunding means better quality tails and more energy to swim to further places. We would also like to be able to get better and more realistic scale tops and source more shells and goodies that we can give out at certain appearances.If we don’t make our target any funds that we do make will go towards improving and repairing our current tails.But Wait We Want to Give You Something Back As Thanks!We have a number of things we will offer you to say thank you for your help. Our arty sides would love to give you a bit of mermaid creativity for you to keep.$5 donations will be thanked with a photo and thankyou note (postage to Australia only).$10 donations will be thanked with a 4x6” signed ocean-themed photographic print of artwork by Amelia or Jessica Pearl. Perfect for framing! (postage to Australia only).$20 donations will be thanked with a short personalised video or letter to you or your child. A great idea for birthday wishes! (postage to Australia only).$30 donations will be thanked with a small hand (mer)made shell hair clip/comb by Jessica Pearl (postage to Australia only).  $50 donations will be thanked with a hand (mer)made piece of jewellery by Amelia or Jessica Pearl (postage to Australia only).$100 pledges will be thanked with an original artwork by either Amelia or Jessica Pearl. These will be approximately A4 in size and ocean themed on watercolour paper. Will look lovely in a frame! (postage to Australia only).  If you are feeling really generous and donate $300 one of us will make a 30 minute appearance at a party or beach of your choosing in Perth, WA (conditions apply, dates are limited).If you are feeling spectacularly generous and donate $500 we will thank you with a half hour personal solo swim-with-the-mermaids experience. We will let you borrow one of our mermaid flippers and teach you how to swim like a mermaid. We will even take a few photos to remember the experience by. If you have a pool we can even take some underwater! We will even give the swimmer a gift to remember us by! Ideal for strong swimmers and pools. Adult supervision required.If you live outside Australia and would like one of these perks please contact us and we will see how much extra the postage is.The FutureWe have lots of ideas about where this could take us in the future. We always want to be visiting beaches and saying hello to people. We also want to be able to come in-land and say hi in on solid ground... perhaps spreading our love for the oceans and a water safety message in schools and community groups.One thing that we would really like to be able to do eventually is use our Mermaid alter-egos to raise awareness about environmental issues and donate to sustainable charities.Other Ways You Can HelpThank you so much for taking the time to read this far!If you like what we are doing we would really appreciate even the smallest donation.Another way you can help us is by sharing this campaign to anyone who you think could help.You can also help out by sharing and liking us on Facebook!Yet again our pages are: www.facebook.com/mermaidameliaandwww.facebook.com/mermaidjessicapearlThank you so much Keep on swimming!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>
<p>The ReHappening is hosted by the Black Mountain College + Art Center and is an annual event taking place on the campus of the former Black Mountain College. The artistic legacy of the college is celebrated for one night of the year with performances and art pieces installed around the campus.   We are honored to be a part of this legacy.  We aspire that this work will contribute value to the arts and science in a similar manner.</p>

<p>For 2015, our third ReHappening, we are building the experience of our team and incorporating the work of artist and composer Gordon Monahan to build an instrument that will alter timbre with the wind and create an atmosphere conducive to the intersection of art and science.  More information on Monahan's work is available at <a href=""http://www.gordonmonahan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gordonmonahan.com</a></p>Inspired by traditions set by early thinkers of Black Mountain College such as Buckminster Fuller and John Cage, the Aeolian Research Team will be installing an experimental instrument in the geographical center of campus.  Dubbed ""The Windrose"", this instrument will be installed on April 4th 2015.  The Windrose is an interactive installation that allows for the creation,  observation, and experience of science and art. Six original compositions are being written and will be performed on the Windrose over the course of BMC ReHappening event.  </div>

<h3>Artistic Value</h3>John Cage introduced the idea of Happenings to the Black Mountain College community in the 1940s.  The nature of the Windrose provides ample opportunity for the exploration of unconventional score notations.  We have asked 6 contemporary composers to write a new piece for this instrument.  We are excited to hear the results, and how they have used this opportunity to push the bounds of what is acceptable in musical expression and music notation.</div>
<div>With this installation of the Windrose, the A.R.T. hopes to continue the work of Robert Raushenberg, John Cage, and past greats of Black Mountain College as well as explore ideas of Japanese artists of the Gutai.   We are interested in acknowledging and studying the legacy of the Gutai and the influence they had on the Happenings.</div>

<p>We are a group of seven artists who met in Chicago several years
ago.  We proposed a group show in
New York and are excited to report that our proposal was accepted.  Our exhibition is scheduled to open Thursday,
September 3rd at <i>The Clemente Soto-Velez Cultural and Educational Center</i> on
Manhattan’s Lower East Side.  The “Clemente”
is a unique center with a growing community of artists.  We are super excited to bring our exhibition
to this wonderful establishment, while bringing more awareness to its importance
as an arts and cultural institution in New York.</p>
<p><b>But we need your
help!</b>  It costs money to bring
an exhibition to its opening night so we are asking you to please consider a
donation to our campaign.  We need
funds for installation hardware, professional curatorial fees, PR and the bulk
of our expenses: shipping—as our artists hail from all parts of the country.  The Clemente is not in a position to
provide all of the necessary funding for us, but we are determined to work
together with them to bring this exhibition to their space and promote the
awareness of this growing and vital institution.  <b>All of our donor’s names will be gratefully acknowledged in
our PR mailings, publications and signage.  Thank you. </b></p>

public school (PS 160) constructed in 1898 by the Board of Education of the
City of New York. By the mid-seventies the building had ceased to serve as a
public school. From 1984 to 1990 it housed Solidaridad Humana, a revolutionary
community-based education program that was comprehensive and bilingual.</i></p>

</div></div>","Every year we add even more amazing Goddesses to our ranks and it gets harder and harder to figure out how to include as many as possible in the calendar campaign.  Last year we had Goddesses team up for girlxgirl images; this year we wanted to bring you the best of the best in images and also include as many Goddesses as we could. So we are spicing things up for something a bit different.These year's theme is Epic Archetypes.  Each of our participating Goddesses is in the works creating an image that epitomizes an Archetype found in some aspect of Geekdom.  From Anime School Girls to Ninja Warriors to Sci-Fi Bombshells and Cat Girls we've got a little of everything planned.  Below you'll find an early submission  ready for viewing from the always illustrious Kassandra Leigh.  As the anime school girl she's in the familiar struggle...


The 2016 Calendar will be a standard 12 month calendar with a centerfold.  Despite this, we have 23 Goddesses participating in the Calendar Campaign.  Each of these lovely ladies will be shooting and submitting an image for possible inclusion in the calendar, along with a lovely portrait similar to last year.  Each of these images will  be offered as prints for purchase (either through one of our campaign perks or afterwards).  The best of the best, a total of 14 images (12 months, 1 Centerfold, and a Cover image) will be used in the calendar.  This allows us to give everyone a chance to participate and will allow us to provide our fans with some truly amazing prints we wouldn't be able to produce otherwise. 


Our Goal includes the cost of paying models, photographers, photo editors and getting the calendars printed.  Why so much you might ask? This year’s project has 23 Goddesses producing 21 Images. That's 23 different Goddesses that all need to be paid and nearly as many photographers.  In order to make these amazing images possible we’ve again enlisted the help of our very own Kassandra Leigh and we need to make sure she gets paid for all the hard work she’ll be giving us.


We will be offering prints of each Goddess, including portrait images similar to last year.  If you make your purchase during the campaign you can save, especially if you buy one of our print packs.

Flamenco is a beautiful and highly developed art form of song and dance created by a people that has suffered marginalization in Europe for centuries, but has demonstrated strength and courage to survive. It is regarded today as a cultural heritage for all humanity and its popularity has spread to many countries, a dance originally from Spain which has crossed national and cultural boundaries. When I saw these dancers on a stage with a blank screen behind, I imagined them performing in an open landscape. That is when the idea of Flamencas was born. </p><p>Flamencas, my eighth solo art exhibition, challenges me to accept and overcome the difficulties of using my artistic resources to the best of my abilities to create scenes in which I can render the human figure in an infinite variety of expressive poses in a natural setting. I love the outdoors, perhaps because I spend so much time alone inside my studio, and I love filling my canvases with light and color. I have deliberately downplayed the ethnic aspect of the flamenco dance in favor of a more transcendental concept:  the fusion of the female figure and landscape in a unified composition in which the essence of womanhood is expressed by beauty, gesture and assertiveness, as manifested in their elegant poise and self-assurance. Flamenco dancing is one of the few forms of dancing in which the woman’s steps are not subjected or directed by her male companion. In Flamenco dancing, women dance as if they own their space. The gracious motion of the hands is one of the most beautiful attributes of flamenco dancing and it is believed that the term “flamenco” derives from the striking poses these dancers assume with their arms and hands that closely resembles the shapes and movement of the flamingo bird. </p><p>Painting is mostly an intellectual and technical activity done alone by an artist in a studio, but when things really begin to happen is when a work of art is shown and someone connects with its meaning and beauty. People responds in so many ways and that reminds me of the reason why I paint, because each person has their own interpretation and each view of my artwork makes it a new and unique creation. I want you to participate in making this connection possible by funding a solo exhibition of 22 medium scale oil paintings, scheduled for mid March of 2015 in San Juan. One way I share my passion for art is through teaching, but showing my work to the public is the most fulfilling way I can achieve that objective. The funds raised by your patronage will cover supplies, framing and marketing, including the invitations and the catalog, in order to make this a successful art exhibition. I have already completed three and I’m about to finish my fourth Flamenca. I envision the whole room full of female dancers connecting with each other in a flow of movement as the viewer goes from one painting to the next. You can partner with me to make that a reality. </p><p>Funds are needed for:</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Art Materials: $<b>1060</b>

I’ve included drawings, some from the series, which I hope you get to appreciate and cherish. In fact, this Indiegogo campaign is a way for people like you to obtain original art at a great price. Due to the high cost of running a gallery, it has to charge a very high commission on the sale of each painting which makes the price of the work dramatically increase. You can overrun that charge with your pledge and obtain true originals, including the first two paintings of the series.</p><p></p><p>These are some of the rewards you'll receive for partnering with me in the success of my Flamencas Art Exhibition.</p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">$20 <strong><strong><strong><strong>Perk</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> Level: A signed personal message with my Thanks on a  4"" x 6"" original pencil drawing. Add $5 to ship outside the US.</span><br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.bmcphotoart.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sampledrawing.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""sampledrawing"" class=""alignnone wp-image-1989 lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bmcphotoart.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sampledrawing.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p><strong>$50 <strong><strong><strong><strong>Perk</strong></strong></strong></strong> Level:</strong> A signed high resolution archival print on a 13"" x 9.5"" Epson Professional Media Watercolor Paper of ""Las Garzas"", the very first painting of the series, a small (up to 8"" x 10"") signed pencil drawing, plus my most sincere ""Thanks"".

<p></p></div>","Last february, I attended a wonderful presentation of a company of female flamenco dancers and was awestruck by their physical beauty and the swirling bravura of their colorful skirts. Flamenco is a beautiful and highly developed art form of song and dance created by a people that has suffered marginalization in Europe for centuries, but has demonstrated strength and courage to survive. It is regarded today as a cultural heritage for all humanity and its popularity has spread to many countries, a dance originally from Spain which has crossed national and cultural boundaries. When I saw these dancers on a stage with a blank screen behind, I imagined them performing in an open landscape. That is when the idea of Flamencas was born. Flamencas, my eighth solo art exhibition, challenges me to accept and overcome the difficulties of using my artistic resources to the best of my abilities to create scenes in which I can render the human figure in an infinite variety of expressive poses in a natural setting. I love the outdoors, perhaps because I spend so much time alone inside my studio, and I love filling my canvases with light and color. I have deliberately downplayed the ethnic aspect of the flamenco dance in favor of a more transcendental concept:  the fusion of the female figure and landscape in a unified composition in which the essence of womanhood is expressed by beauty, gesture and assertiveness, as manifested in their elegant poise and self-assurance. Flamenco dancing is one of the few forms of dancing in which the woman’s steps are not subjected or directed by her male companion. In Flamenco dancing, women dance as if they own their space. The gracious motion of the hands is one of the most beautiful attributes of flamenco dancing and it is believed that the term “flamenco” derives from the striking poses these dancers assume with their arms and hands that closely resembles the shapes and movement of the flamingo bird. Painting is mostly an intellectual and technical activity done alone by an artist in a studio, but when things really begin to happen is when a work of art is shown and someone connects with its meaning and beauty. People responds in so many ways and that reminds me of the reason why I paint, because each person has their own interpretation and each view of my artwork makes it a new and unique creation. I want you to participate in making this connection possible by funding a solo exhibition of 22 medium scale oil paintings, scheduled for mid March of 2015 in San Juan. One way I share my passion for art is through teaching, but showing my work to the public is the most fulfilling way I can achieve that objective. The funds raised by your patronage will cover supplies, framing and marketing, including the invitations and the catalog, in order to make this a successful art exhibition. I have already completed three and I’m about to finish my fourth Flamenca. I envision the whole room full of female dancers connecting with each other in a flow of movement as the viewer goes from one painting to the next. You can partner with me to make that a reality. Funds are needed for:

Art Materials: $1060

Framing: $1980

Publicity: $750


Graphic design and print services for invitation and brochures

Miscellaneous Costs: $120 

TOTAL: $3910In return you get a huge THANK YOU plus:• Original drawings • Handsigned limited edition archival paper prints• Limited edition canvas prints• Original paintingsThere are plenty of rewards for each level of pledge, from signed prints on archival paper, canvas prints two thirds the size of the original oil paintings, to the actual painting themselves. I’ve included drawings, some from the series, which I hope you get to appreciate and cherish. In fact, this Indiegogo campaign is a way for people like you to obtain original art at a great price. Due to the high cost of running a gallery, it has to charge a very high commission on the sale of each painting which makes the price of the work dramatically increase. You can overrun that charge with your pledge and obtain true originals, including the first two paintings of the series.These are some of the rewards you'll receive for partnering with me in the success of my Flamencas Art Exhibition.$20 Perk Level: A signed personal message with my Thanks on a  4"" x 6"" original pencil drawing. Add $5 to ship outside the US.$50 Perk Level: A signed high resolution archival print on a 13"" x 9.5"" Epson Professional Media Watercolor Paper of ""Las Garzas"", the very first painting of the series, a small (up to 8"" x 10"") signed pencil drawing, plus my most sincere ""Thanks"".

The first two perks are basically more pre-orders for the deck, but the rest include one of a kind artwork by the artist. All of the perk levels come with a deck.

I'll be making custom thank-you cards to be mailed out with all decks, and include a custom inked sketch in each card of the animal or plant of your choosing. (note: this may push back the date of delivery) If I have time, I may color the sketches with pencil/marker.If we raise $2,000 I'll make time, and will guarantee to color all of the sketches.If we somehow manage to raise over $5,000, I will write up a way to use this specific deck in divination, incorporating the mythology behind the constellations as well as the card's traditional divinatory meaning, and make it available online. I cannot guarantee when this will be available. If we raise $10,000, aside from my undying gratitude at this show of support, I'll look into what I need to do a special printing of the deck with the guide book from the previous goal in it. Contributors to this campaign will get a discount and be the first to know about it when this happens. I don't totally know what would be involved in this, but I'll do my best to make it happen.PerksPerks are incentives to give money. The first two perks are basically more pre-orders for the deck, but the rest include one of a kind artwork by the artist. All of the perk levels come with a deck. If you would like multiple perks (ex. the drawing for a number card and the pheonix print) but don't want multiple decks, please get in touch with me either through Indiegogo or email and we'll work it out.All of the perk levels come with a deck. Please be aware that the lowest perk level is only available for Connecticut College students, faculty, and staff that can receive the decks through the campus mail system. The additional cost on the regular 'Get A Deck' is to cover the cost of shipping.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>
</p><p>
			With this mural we aim to create 
awareness toward and engage the viewer with three topics representing 
self-improvement and empowerment, protecting and honoring endangered 
species, and challenging our existence as modern humans.  Each topic 
will be represented by one of three individual artists.  The title, 
“Control What You Can,” captures the essence of what the mural will 
strive to illustrate.  The work seeks to inspire the viewer to make 
small adjustments toward “being the change that you want to see in the 
world.”

			Jackson Place Community Council is a 
501(c)(3) non-profit association that has organized mural projects on 
and around Jackson St. in Seattle, WA.  We are working in conjunction 
with this grassroots organization who’s entire focus is making the 
Jackson / Rainier area a more beautiful place to live.  Due to their 
501(c)(3) status, you can write off your contribution to our cause as a

<p>The
 mural is on a 240’ x 10’ wall in the heart of Seattle, WA.  The 
location is between downtown and South Seattle.  The mural will have a 
title and sponsors section as well as three distinct yet connected areas
 where each artist will tackle their subject matter.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>This
 piece will portray realistic images of The Western Black Rhino and The 
Virunga Gorilla in their natural habitat. The artist will use his own 
twist and artistic vision by adding creative design elements and unique 
techniques to give the viewer a glimpse into a world that most humans 
will never see. The lush overgrown jungle to the dry savanna habitat 
will be on display in the painting.</p>

<i><em>- There are two main goals with his
 mural:  To bring awareness to these animals, their habitat and the 
challenges they face. To remember the fallen rangers that have lost 
their lives in the protection of these species.</em></i>

THE PROJECT




			With this mural we aim to create 
awareness toward and engage the viewer with three topics representing 
self-improvement and empowerment, protecting and honoring endangered 
species, and challenging our existence as modern humans.  Each topic 
will be represented by one of three individual artists.  The title, 
“Control What You Can,” captures the essence of what the mural will 
strive to illustrate.  The work seeks to inspire the viewer to make 
small adjustments toward “being the change that you want to see in the 
world.”
		


JACKSON PLACE COMMUNITY COUNCIL




			Jackson Place Community Council is a 
501(c)(3) non-profit association that has organized mural projects on 
and around Jackson St. in Seattle, WA.  We are working in conjunction 
with this grassroots organization who’s entire focus is making the 
Jackson / Rainier area a more beautiful place to live.  Due to their 
501(c)(3) status, you can write off your contribution to our cause as a 
charitable donation.THE MURAL CONCEPT.




THE WALL:






The
 mural is on a 240’ x 10’ wall in the heart of Seattle, WA.  The 
location is between downtown and South Seattle.  The mural will have a 
title and sponsors section as well as three distinct yet connected areas
 where each artist will tackle their subject matter.







SPECS:





			138’  = Total area used for artist subject matter
46’  = Total area used for mural title and sponsor list
56’  = Total area used between each section represented by universe design



The mural will be set on a background 
that looks like the universe.  This is symbolic of how the universe, 
humans and the subject matter are interconnected.  The “fabric of life” 
is represented by the strings that link and pull together the different 
parts of the mural.Endangered Species and Their Habitat:

This
 piece will portray realistic images of The Western Black Rhino and The 
Virunga Gorilla in their natural habitat. The artist will use his own 
twist and artistic vision by adding creative design elements and unique 
techniques to give the viewer a glimpse into a world that most humans 
will never see. The lush overgrown jungle to the dry savanna habitat 
will be on display in the painting.




- There are two main goals with his
 mural:  To bring awareness to these animals, their habitat and the 
challenges they face. To remember the fallen rangers that have lost 
their lives in the protection of these species.

Self Improvement:

This collage of imagery is 
positive “self improvement’’ suggestions and quotes.  The imagery will 
be a style that fuses sign painter era graphics with the modern street 
artist of today.  Ideas such as “Health Before Wealth”, “Knowledge And 
Understanding”, “Show And Prove”, “One For All”, “Game Not Fame”, etc. 
will be expressed in the piece utilizing a wide array of bright, 
uplifting colors and patterns.




			- The goal of this project is to help raise awareness of one’s personal health and knowledge.

Achieve Release:

This
 collage of imagery is a narrative toward the challenges of life in 
modern society.  Topics illustrated include how the concepts of time and
 currency have created the stressful grind of every-day life as we know 
it in the 21st century and the death of a more peaceful existence.



- It is his goal to capture the 
emotion of the struggle to suppress our human instinct to run free like 
wild horses and succumb to the framework of modern life.

</div></div>","A hilariously kinky coffee table book that will make you shoot Klingon raktajino out of your nose!

Extraterrestrials came to our world! They read a book called FIFTY SHADES OF GREY and became inspired ( or is that confused? You decide)! They came to the conclusion that the best way to understand the human race was to try all fifty shady shenanigans themselves! The result is a book filled with hilariously sexy, sci-fi kink! No fetish, perversion or paraphilia is spared as these Greys try out flogging, pegging, scatology, necrophilia, threesomes, orgies, water sports and just about every other subversive sexual act you can think of! And just to sweeten the pot, each hysterical image features a caption that parodies a slogan or catchphrase from one of your favorite sci-fi shows!



There are 47 more pages like the ones above!!! (I'd show you the images for Necrophilia and Scatology but I CAN'T!!! More on that later!)

Origin of this nutty idea:

Most people know me as a singer/songwriter/performer, but I also write books, design toys, make films and come up with the occasional crazy T-shirt idea. Though a lot of my work is serious, many might say that what I do best is the trifecta of PUNS, PARODY and PERVERSION (check out my pervy Star Trek and Star Wars album, ""BiTrektual"" if you're not convinced!- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBrz0CctEXH7uu4PqrN8fvCPRnqQ56xfN )
Well, last month I was coming up with some parody T-shirt idea for my friends at http://www.offworlddesigns.com/ 
I had just whipped up these three lovelies:

I was wondering what film to parody next when it hit me! How about I make a shirt parodying that novel and movie everyone I know seems to despise, Fifty Shades of Grey!!! But I'll make it ""Fifty Shades of Greys!"" Get it? It will be aliens buggering each other! It will be hilarious! I did one drawing... then two... then three... before I knew it this thing was growing out of control like a tribble infestation. I knew I had way too much material for a T-shirt or even a whole line of shirts! This had to be a BOOK! A book with FIFTY PAGES OF GREYS doin' it!
Here's three more of the pages:



I'm nearly half way done already! But I need YOU to help me finish it!


GOALS: 

I have three goals for this campaign.
1) FUNDING:
Naturally, I need to raise money to print this book and for fulfillment. I'm keeping the figure on the low side to improve the chances of hitting the goal but ideally, I'd really like to raise $10,000 to do it right.
2) SCREW CENSORSHIP:
When I first started working on this book, I was posting pages from it on my social media sites. I was so excited to share them! Now granted, I know this project isn't for everyone (just wonderfully geeky perverts like YOU and ME!) but I did not expect the backlash I received! So called ""social justice warriors"" with nothing better to do, flagged the images for the necrophilia and scatology pages and some of the images were removed from Facebook and Instagram! I was really shocked because when I see something I don't like I just... you know... look at something else instead! I don't go out of my way to try to censor people!
Aren't you tired of it? Do you feel it's right that these concerned citizens have the power to get DC Comics to cancel a variant comic book cover (that they weren't even going to buy anyway!) because they made the villain too villainous? Hell no! Me either! 
When I was a kid comedy was raw and it was raunchy and edgy and pushed the envelope. And that's what made it funny! This book is EXACTLY the kind of book I'd mischievously flip through in the back aisle of Spencer Gifts as a teenager! And I'd laugh my ass off because it's just so totally wrong! LOL! That magic is becoming extinct and it's for that very reason that I I HAVE to make this book! I hope you're with me on this! Suffice to say, if you like Cards Against Humanity... you're going to love this book!
3) SCREW FIFTY SHADES OF GREY!
And lastly, the majority of my kinky friends fall into three categories. People who hate that book and film because they think it's a lame, outsiders attempt at seeming like they know anything about BDSM, people who think it's nothing more than a poor excuse to promote the abuse of women and lastly, people who think it's BOTH!
 Picture this: Wouldn't it be amazing if every time someone Googled that book they were directed to my book instead? LOL! Can you just picture the look on their faces? Do you want to live in that world? Because I SURE DO! Ha! 
Now, it would not hurt their book sales in any way. My book is clearly a VERY DIFFERENT animal (ps: wait until you see the Beastiality page! ) and very clearly a silly, silly parody. But still, it would be funny as hell! 
So please... if you love sci-fi and kinky sex... puns, parody and perversion... contribute to the campaign and make this completely hilarious and totally ridiculous book something we can all pass around in between rounds of Cards Against Humanity! 
Here's a couple more pages for you:

<h3>About my mother</h3>
<p>My mother is 100% to blame for my love of cats. She treated the cats in her life like they were her children. Growing up, I had a good number of furry brothers and sisters. In my travels, I often would send her photos of cats on the street. When she knew I was returning to San Juan, after a friend requested I create a cat calendar, she asked for one as well. I flew to San Juan on a Thursday in early July and spent a couple of days taking many photographs of cats lounging on the cobblestone streets, prowling through the fields surrounding the forts, and guarding colorful doorways. A few days later she passed away unexpectedly after an accident. She never saw the photos but I still feel that the calendar still needs to be made. In memory of her I will be donating all profits to two cat charities, one for the cats of San Juan and the other for a group of feral felines on her favorite vacation island, Ocracoke. <br/></p>

Paint flies through mid-air as speed paint performance artist Rock Demarco
transforms canvas into  giant
masterpieces live on stage.  Paint
splatters of ultra-violet and blue mimic lightning streams of energy as the
light filled image of a properly glorified Nikola Tesla shines through the
darkness of black canvas. It is Tesla reborn from a past that misunderstood
him, into the future moment of now that is ready and willing to embrace his
genius. <p></p>

<p>Over the past 10
years Rock Demarco has performed thousands of his signature rock n roll live
painting shows around the globe. He has appeared with countless celebrities
that are featured at his ON TOUR page. 2 million dollars! That's the amount of
money raised for charity by the sale of Rock's art at auction with a single
piece topping $105,000! Rock's work can be found on display in many corporate
headquarters, airport installations, and private collections of professional
ball players, musicians and movie stars. </p>
<p>Rock has performed
for live audiences as large as 200,000 fans. Along with Superbowl and other

The Painting:

Paint flies through mid-air as speed paint performance artist Rock Demarco
transforms canvas into  giant
masterpieces live on stage.  Paint
splatters of ultra-violet and blue mimic lightning streams of energy as the
light filled image of a properly glorified Nikola Tesla shines through the
darkness of black canvas. It is Tesla reborn from a past that misunderstood
him, into the future moment of now that is ready and willing to embrace his
genius. 


""In my painting I wanted to capture the unique spark that Tesla brings to our world."" –Rock Demarco“I commissioned this painting to bring honor to a man who’s inspired all of the
people in our world moving towards a new source of sustainable alternative
energy.  The success of our continued
efforts based on Tesla’s work can change everything, and as the great man
himself once said; unlocking the secrets of 3,6 & 9 will give us a key to
the universe”- Larry Powalisz Tesla Energy Solutions LLC.


   
The
Artist Rock Demarco: The Fastest Painter in the World! 
Performance artist
and speed painter, Rock Demarco, kick started his career as a small child by
plastering graffiti on his parent's walls with crayon. Never a fan of mild
mannered art, Rock instead takes his audience on a wild ride of imagination by
challenging them to look at the world through a different window. 
Over the past 10
years Rock Demarco has performed thousands of his signature rock n roll live
painting shows around the globe. He has appeared with countless celebrities
that are featured at his ON TOUR page. 2 million dollars! That's the amount of
money raised for charity by the sale of Rock's art at auction with a single
piece topping $105,000! Rock's work can be found on display in many corporate
headquarters, airport installations, and private collections of professional
ball players, musicians and movie stars. 
Rock has performed
for live audiences as large as 200,000 fans. Along with Superbowl and other
half-time shows Rock has been featured on all major TV networks (FOX, CBS, ABS,
CMT, TNT) and appeared live on Good Morning America where he painted a portrait
of Diane Sawyer.

  The Rock Demarco Foundation
for Kids 
The Rock Demarco Foundation is a Michigan
non-profit founded in 2012. Being an artist Rock realizes the benefits of art
and creativity to a child, especially children going through a difficult time.
He decided to bring his passion for art and for children together and raise
awareness and funds for a cause near and dear to his heart. The foundations
mission is to help young people rediscover childhood magic through artistic
expression by the placement of art therapy rooms in children’s hospitals
nationwide.

The first year was rough, after a week on the road Lakey was almost 1,000 miles from home with $0.00 left to his name. He stayed on the road a couple more months and survived off of less than $100 per week most weeks. Lakey claims over 99.5% of people ignored him and the remaining 0.5% was split pretty evenly between very nice people and very mean people.</p>
<p>Lakey's family wasn't exactly proud of the new job with his grandmother even suggesting he needed a suit and tie job again...So at the beginning of 2013 Lakey got himself a jacket and tie then made a sign saying ""Grandma says I need a job wearing a suit and tie...this is my compromise.""</p>
<p>The sign got rid of the invisibility, it made pedestrians, shop owners, and police men smile and laugh. It made business men see someone dressed like them sitting among the homeless, it made artists see an artist dressed in the unofficial outfit of sell outs, and it allowed the homeless to realize they can do something more creative than beg.</p>
<p>After finishing a 10,000 mile tour this year, then loosing $300++ worth of Prismacolor markers a couple days ago, Lakey was advised by facebook fans to try a fundraising website. That being the case here he is hoping to get enough to recover his markers. If more than the goal amount is reached the excess will be used to invest in framing/matting artwork and preparing for the next tour.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>$500 - Prismacolor or Copic Markers</div>
<div>Any excess will be spent on:</div>
<div>$150 - 10x10foot tent</div>
<div>$200 2x8 foot tables</div>
<div>$1,000++ for framing/matting of over 60 different art pieces</div>
<div>or travelling</div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Lakey makes people think differently about artists, homelessness, and fashion while making art accessible to anyone strolling along the city sidewalk. Whereas most street art is vandalism done in shadows Lakey makes it a performance, Lakey becomes a living street art installation. His presence inspires creation and critical thinking while claiming back public property with respectful and considerate exercises of expression.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Most days are a risk or challenge of some sort sharing artwork like this. Certain shop owners, police officers, and street people make what I do too risky for lots of people.

<p>My name is Randy Grskovic and I’ve been an artist for nearly my entire life. My goal is to consistently make thought-provoking images that encourage people to think beyond what the world is selling them. I want to share these images freely with everyone and I have always been hesitant to sell them. Putting a price on artwork creates a great divide. The art becomes an object, and often in our commodity-based culture, sometimes the meaning or value becomes hidden behind a price tag. What I aim to do is use democracy in a new way. By finding a small number of people who want to become patrons for the arts, I can create a body of work that is owned by all the patrons. Each person who contributes will receive an original work of art for their collection but will also be contributors to a larger compilation, which will be published online for everyone to view for free.  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I’m looking to find 100 patrons who will contribute $100 each to raise $10,000. I estimate to make this body of work it will take 4 months for me to work on full time. Indigogo will take 7% of this goal leaving $9300. I estimate that my material costs to be approximately $2000 and the mail-out of the artwork to all patrons will cost $800. What remains is a $1625 stipend per month for me to create this body of work. I will be actively sharing the images to view online daily. I encourage the continual discussion of the images, because for me, that is what real art is. It is not the object, but the conversation it incites.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The kind of patronage I am referring to is not that of a buyer and seller. I hope to encourage a relationship built upon trust that the artwork created as a whole is greater than one piece alone. This trust is based on my previous work and the testimonials of my patrons. The work I am going to be mailing out is valued at $300 on the art market, but to reiterate, the aim is not to sell artwork. What I ask is a gift in trust from each patron of only $100 and in turn I will select a piece from the collection to send to him or her as a gift. These gifts will then create a larger body of work that will be available for free online as a gift for all. This publication’s first page will be a foreword dedicated to the 100 patrons whose names will ever be associated with art patronage. </p>
<p>Additionally, this patronage should not be a limited offer. I have set 100 patrons as a reasonable goal, however, the more the merrier. If you want to contribute more, you can. If there are ultimately 365 patrons, I will continue this project for an entire year. If you want to sponsor patronage for someone who would like to be involved but can’t afford it, I highly encourage this too. The motive of this project is sharing, and a piece of art would make an amazing gift for someone who couldn’t afford it in the regular market.</p>
<p>People who know me and know my work are aware that this type of community building is my passion. Over the past 5 years, I have actively opened my own temporary galleries at my own risk and expense to share art with everyone. I have never charged admission and I have always invited the public. This isn’t about money or exclusive circles; this is an honest expression and desire to communicate with those who want to listen.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I am aware that I have a lot of supporters out there. If you can’t be involved as a patron in a financial way, that’s ok. If you believe in a project like this, please share it with someone who may want to be involved. Maybe you know someone who is looking for artwork but doesn’t know where to start. $100 is a small risk for a first time investor in culture.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to share this idea through his or her social networks, twitter, tumblr, facebook etc. Indigogo would definitely like for you to use their sharing tools as it helps their network and helps me get my campaign to the top of their site. I hope that this idea encourages people to change their thoughts about what it means to support the arts and artists and that it encourages artists to continue to share their ideas with one another. I hope it inspires everyone to think about giving rather than buying. </p></div>","Short Summary

<b>How We Began</b><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the spring of 2012 Lori Greenberg, began her journey down the path that with YOUR help will lead to Aurora Studio &amp; Gallery.  She had been counseling an artist who had lost everything due to her lack of housing, including her art materials, an outlet that helped the artist manage stress.  This affected Greenberg deeply and it was through this encounter that the idea for a supportive art studio for artists in recovery from mental illness, addiction and/or homelessness hit Greenberg like a proverbial ton of bricks.  She began researching art studios that provide support to those in recovery and found many successful programs.  It took her over another year to make the decision to begin the process of creating a base of support that would be needed to start Aurora Studio &amp; Gallery from the ground up.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The plan for Aurora Studio &amp; Gallery is to offer a studio that will provide artists with the space and art supplies to explore their personal creativity, which they could not otherwise obtain nor afford.  A collective studio that will work in collaboration with area artists, healing arts instructors, therapists and volunteers to create a structure where artists may gather to work on their art while gaining inner strength that further allow them to heal and flourish.  </p>

<p><b>The Brick &amp; Mortar Costs</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By <b>supporting</b> Aurora Studio &amp; Gallery you will become a partner in building the foundation for our healing art studio, along with becoming a partner in the recovery process for each of our artists (how cool is that?)  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The projected annual budget for Aurora Studio &amp; Gallery is $110,000 - 120,000 which includes start up costs, overhead, two staff, a part-time book keeper, as well as rent, office needs, utilities; and variable costs.  Retail sales of original art will be sold in the gallery, with 70% going directly to the artist.  The remaining 30% will go back into the organization.  Other gift items to be sold in the gallery include items such as T-shirts, gift cards and calendars.</p>
<p><b>EXCITING NEWS</b> - since starting this campaign we have found a faith community that will allow us to use their fellowship hall two afternoons a week to host studio time.  Your assistance will help us to continue to move forward, offsetting the cost of visiting artists and payment for a very part- time director.</p>
<p><b>How YOU can make a difference!</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The artists for whom we plan to open Aurora Studio are talented individuals who have struggled with health issues, isolation, poverty and numerous challenging life conditions.   A supported art studio will provide a bridge towards a more stable path where artists may gain a sense of community to enhance their well being and help create a more dynamic overall arts community.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Your support for this project will enhance the health and well being of our artists by providing: </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Wrap around services; Aurora Studio &amp; Gallery will collaborate with local substance abuse and mental health providers.</i></li>
<li><i>Daily support from a professional staff, artists and other healing arts instructors.<br/></i></li>
<li><i>Recognition and affirmation of our artist’s work.<br/></i></li>
<li><i>The ability for artists to express themselves in a way that encourages healing, and increases awareness and sensitivity from within our community.<br/></i></li>
<li><i>A sense of purpose – many who suffer from mental illness feel impending hopelessness. The opportunity for our artists to work on their art will move them towards hope.<br/></i></li>
<li><i>Stress reduction, it has been noted by other similar art programs that artists benefit by feeling a decrease in stress when symptoms of their illness flare up.<br/></i></li>
<li><i>Greater self-sufficiency.  Artists will receive 70% of the income earned from each sale.<br/></i></li>
<li>
<i>The potential to branch out and work with other area artists and gain skills; both in the arts and self-actualization.</i><br/>

The artists for whom we plan to open Aurora Studio are talented individuals who have struggled with health issues, isolation, poverty and numerous challenging life conditions.   A supported art studio will provide a bridge towards a more stable path where artists may gain a sense of community to enhance their well being and help create a more dynamic overall arts community.




Your support for this project will enhance the health and well being of our artists by providing: 




Wrap around services; Aurora Studio & Gallery will collaborate with local substance abuse and mental health providers.
Daily support from a professional staff, artists and other healing arts instructors.
Recognition and affirmation of our artist’s work.
The ability for artists to express themselves in a way that encourages healing, and increases awareness and sensitivity from within our community.
A sense of purpose – many who suffer from mental illness feel impending hopelessness. The opportunity for our artists to work on their art will move them towards hope.
Stress reduction, it has been noted by other similar art programs that artists benefit by feeling a decrease in stress when symptoms of their illness flare up.
Greater self-sufficiency.  Artists will receive 70% of the income earned from each sale.

The potential to branch out and work with other area artists and gain skills; both in the arts and self-actualization.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Flame came about after organizing the Fruit Loopz Youth stage at Toronto Pride 2013, and seeing that folks wanted more- more opportunities to gain skills in art making, more queer spaces, and more events that celebrate queer youth culture and the arts and increase visibility- not just once a year! </p><p>Art is such a powerful medium to share our stories and lgbtqq2sii youth,
 often feel the need for more queer spaces where they feel safer to 
really explore and express the multitude of stories we hold. In addition 2014 brings
 World Pride to Toronto. While this can be fun it can also be 
overwhelming and it is so important that space and visibility is also 
given to our youth and the amazing Art they bring. <br/></p><p>So we partnered with Native Earth Performing Arts, Buddies in Bad times, CTYS, AGO, SOY, Delisle Youth Services, Griffin Center, ORAD, Planned Parenthood, Sketch, Youth Line, People Project and made a plan to create FLAME!<br/></p>
<p>So far, we have developed 5 art based programs in:- Music- making &amp; spoken word; movement &amp; theater; digital storytelling, Radical Zine making &amp; comic books; and Storytelling. We will be starting the program at the end of January 2014<br/></p><p>These programs will be run in blocks of 6 weeks and result in several youth led, collaborative events that celebrate Queer youth culture and increases 
the visibility of queer youths art. <br/></p><p>All the workshops will be<b> free </b>for lgbtqq2sii youth, 29 and under. The program series will provide skills in the arts, and opportunities for individuals to make connections and community.  The events will provide an opportunity for artist to build their confidence and gain skills in working collaboratively.  <br/></p><p>The program will also be very much connected to self care; Workshops will be done in spaces that also have access to additional services such as Health care, harm reduction, access to varying service providers.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Hello Ladies and Gentlemen,</span></h3>
<p>My name is Frederick Eberhardt, bka Breeze I Life This The Poet. Spoken word artist from Richmond Va, who has been walking on faith in this craft for roughly four years now. I dont want to hold you so I'll get straight to the point, I NEED YOUR HELP!!!</p>
<p>There is huge event happening June 5th-8th called the Southern Fried Poetry Slam. An event full of love, family, and the most awesome talent you will find, not only on the south east, but in the country. I have attended and done very well for the past two years (top 10 individually two years straight out of anywhere between 144-176 poets).This year the event will be held in New Orleans, Louisana. After everything from misleading information to unrespected agreements attempted to keep me from making it this year, God stepped in and reminded me that what He has for me, is mine.</p>
<p>I had one shot left to make it, the terms, win the very prestigious LEAF Slam to secure the last individual spot for Southern Fried. I came in fourth (which has been said to be unheard of for a first timer). And just when i thought it was over, I was presented with the opportunity that the top three finishers turned down. The last indie spot to represent LEAF at Southern Fried. Yes, God answers prayers.</p>
<p>Thing is being that its now so close to the date of the event, I am unsure that I can make the money to afford hotel, transportation, food, ect in such a short time...HOPEFULLY, THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>My target goal to make this possible is 500$ (transportation from Charlotte Nc to New Orleans La and back, hotel room for 3-4 days, food). I honestly need more than that, but I am not helpless, I WORK, HARD!!! There for i do have a show that is being accounted for and a slam i hopefully win (pray for me) going towards the situation.</p>
<p>I do not believe in something for nothing, so as a result of your help I am offering my work to you.</p>
<p>All help is greatly appreciated, if goal is not reached it will be added to what is made outside of it and used for the explained purpose...""SOFRY OR BUST""!!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This event has been the single most important event of my poetry life for the past two years. I have been perfecting and improving my writing for one purpose, SOUTHERN FRIED FINAL STAGE. This is where they take the top four individuals and teams at the end of prelims to battle for the title of Southern Fried Champion. The feat has narrowly slipped my grasp the past two years and I believe whole heartedly that this is my year.All i need is a chance!</p>

This can be overwhelming for those who are not motivated by the pressures of lengthy lists and long days. </p><p>The 2018 Lavender &amp; Sage collection was designed (and re-designed, and re-designed...) to help you to find some balance between what fills and drains your battery. We have made versatility and customization a priority, as we understand everyone learns and works differently. This is especially true for the featured 2018 Self Care Day Planner, which allows you to track your daily battery in conjunction with scheduling both<i> self</i> and<i> life </i>tasks and appointments. <br/><br/><strong><u>Our Core Values</u></strong><br/> </p><ul>
<li>Integrity: Each tool in our 2018 collection has been carefully designed and vetted by yours truly. It's important to us that we ensure each tool is something we've found helpful and use on a daily basis. We also work very hard to ensure that our stationery tools are as accessible as possible to both our community and others. </li>
<li>Environmental Friendliness: When you open your 2018 Self Care Day Planner, you'll notice something different. You won't see those extra sections available in most day planners- the notes section, contacts, holidays, time zones, etc. Upon surveying many stationery lovers, we discovered that these sections are hardly ever used, and so we've removed them completely. In addition, we use earth friendly packaging printed with vegetable and soy based dyes and avoid using plastic wherever possible. </li>
<li>Community: Community involvement is of great importance to us, which is why we've made it one of our core values. Working with local small businesses, non-profit organizations and people within our community to help advocate and educate makes a larger impact than we realize. That is why we donate 5% of our profits to local non-profit organization, <a href=""http://www.kindkrafts.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kind Krafts</a>, and will be launching our MAMA line to help raise funds for Doula Services in the HRM. We also plan to co-host events and workshops to help bring the community together and learn about self-care, mental health and overall wellness. </li>
</ul><p><u><strong>About Me</strong></u></p><p>I am an only parent to the most precious babe (in my life), and a Psychology student here in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I have been very passionate about advocating for Mental Health and Wellness for many years, and have lived through my own lengthy experience with mental illness. I was able to find solace through art and journaling, which has fueled my passion for creating effective planning and coping tools.  <br/>After running my own non-profit organization in the field of Mental Health, I acquired many skills that I felt important to utilize to help those around me... And so became Lavender &amp; Sage. <br/>Self Care is something we all need to implement more actively into our daily lives. It takes on many forms, and goes by many names. It's important to acknowledge that self care may look different for you than it does for me. <br/>I strongly believe there are two equally important elements to self care. There is the nurturing side, found in relaxation, compassion and gentleness (Lavender). And there is the strong, cleansing side, found in activities such as therapy and self-reflection (Sage). </p><p>Each and every piece I've created for Lavender &amp; Sage has a little piece of my very soul put into it.

<br/>Short Summary <ul>
<li>Christina Molcillo, founder of Black Lotus Clothing + Haunted Mansion art collective (4 other individuals) need your help!</li> <li>We need money to keep up maintenance on this 150+ year old house in Oakland, California. Repairs are very costly and unexpected. For example, last year we had to replace a sewer line, burst pipes, and a fence that fell down... costing over $14,000.</li> <li>Keeping the Haunted Mansion livable is necessary to continue creating amazing art and throwing full-blown movie-quality themed parties (like the Goonies, Nightmare Before Christmas, etc.).</li>
<li>It's the place where we actually build and create: it's where we live, it all happens here. It's a place for others to stay and make art with us: we regularly host travelers, photographers, and support the artistic community.</li>

</div><div> <p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p> <ul>
<li>We are trying to raise 15,000 to ease the burden of the major repairs that need to be done to the foundation of our home.  This would including materials for putting in shear walling that will keep our house from falling over in the event of an earth quake, water proofing the foundation to stop water from further damaging the property and keep it from slipping outward. Your funds will also go toward professional contractors who can jack up the house to replace areas where the bricks are falling apart. </li>
<li>If even more money is raised your donation will go into a fund for our next years event.

</div> <p><b>""Goonies never say die!""</b></p></div>","Short Summary 
Christina Molcillo, founder of Black Lotus Clothing + Haunted Mansion art collective (4 other individuals) need your help! We need money to keep up maintenance on this 150+ year old house in Oakland, California. Repairs are very costly and unexpected. For example, last year we had to replace a sewer line, burst pipes, and a fence that fell down... costing over $14,000. Keeping the Haunted Mansion livable is necessary to continue creating amazing art and throwing full-blown movie-quality themed parties (like the Goonies, Nightmare Before Christmas, etc.).
It's the place where we actually build and create: it's where we live, it all happens here. It's a place for others to stay and make art with us: we regularly host travelers, photographers, and support the artistic community.

We love pouring our heart and soul into these creative projects but they're not without their financial burden. To keep producing these one-of-a-kind experiences we need outside support from passionate people like YOU. 
What We Need & What You Get
 Break it down for folks in more detail: 
We are trying to raise 15,000 to ease the burden of the major repairs that need to be done to the foundation of our home.  This would including materials for putting in shear walling that will keep our house from falling over in the event of an earth quake, water proofing the foundation to stop water from further damaging the property and keep it from slipping outward. Your funds will also go toward professional contractors who can jack up the house to replace areas where the bricks are falling apart. 
If even more money is raised your donation will go into a fund for our next years event. As we are probably the most resourceful kids when it comes to getting things free off Craigslist/dumpster diving, and having everything built by friends, volunteers and the people who all live here…. There are just some materials we can't source for free. This money is not going into our personal pockets for fancy shoes or car repairs, it will all go back into the house and into future projects that you will get to see, come to, or be apart of.  We have TONS of Perks handmade by us: iconic props, hand made couture gowns/headpieces/dresses, photography, AND funny merchandise featuring the characters who live at the Haunted Mansion. Everything will go towards recouping costs for events and the MANY repairs needed: waterproofing, preventative repairs on the foundation, etc. 
  The Impact 
Supporting us means using art to bring people together. Creating a platform for other artists and contributing to the larger cause of building something bigger than ourselves
This is the first time Haunted Mansion has asked for help from the community: For TEN years solid Christina has poured herself into creating unique art, building sets, and sharing her talents with the world often without any compensation whatsoever.
Black Lotus Clothing has been featured in Vogue Italia as well as Sub Zero art festival in San Jose, California. Christina's work has been in the #1 crafting magazine Belle Armoire (three times!). In 2014 alone her work has graced four magazine covers.
Featured in the Discovery Channel show Oddities SF, representing San Francisco as a designer and showing off the unique charm of the house. (LOTS of taxidermy and dark Victorian/bohemian decor.)
The magnitude of these projects is far more than a single person can handle - it takes a community. We humbly ask for your patronage and support.
 
  Risks & Challenges The more we put into creating remarkable art the less we have to make sure the house won't fall down (literally).

<p>Finding a traditional publisher that's willing to take on the financial risks of publishing a book by an unknown author is already difficult enough.

That said, and to maintain the integrity of my visual series, I decided to opt for self-publishing, while submitting individual poems and stories to different literary journals and magazines.

<p><strong>Who I am….</strong></p>
<p>My name is Chiara Fersini but I am also known as Himitsuhana.</p>
<p>I started research in photography in 2007. Before that moment I considered photography just as a useful tool to document events but I never gave to a photograph an artistic importance. Then I found out that photography could be much more than a simple snapshot of reality. The discovery of great digital artists made me want to try experiment myself, made me  improve steadily my skills and I began to think I could develop a personal style as well as to show the intricate world that I’ve always felt inside. My favorite field of research is the Surreal Photography.</p>

</h3>
<b>OVERVIEW</b><br/>The GUAPA Project™ is an intergenerational, multimedia arts project representing the feminine soul of the Latina experience. It highlights the achievements and life lessons of Latina leaders and innovators through photographic and video narratives, a theatrical performance, a coffee table book and accompanying personal development workshops. The GUAPA Project™ is a local tribute to women that connects the experiences of our divine Guapa Goddess with women everywhere. Phase 1 of The GUAPA Project™ will premiere in March 2015 for Women's History Month.<br/><br/><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br/>The GUAPA Project™ is an exploration and celebration of the Latina experience and identity. It is intended to inspire, educate and facilitate women’s and girls’ ability to transcend personal, cultural and societal myths about feminine power thereby strengthening leadership, esteem, and success. Guapa is a reflection of the unlimited potential, relevance, and brilliance of the Latina diaspora. <br/><br/>The term Guapa has been used to describe and define both physical and character traits of women. It is most commonly understood as physical attractiveness or emotional toughness. DeAlmas Women’s Institute is reclaiming the term to embody the fullness of the feminine spirit. Guapa is redefined as the authentic power and creative essence of women.<br/><br/>It is our hope that this project will be a resource for a continued movement of personal and community transformation, esteem, progress, and love that will inform, unify, and galvanize the Guapa in each of us.<br/><br/><b>ABOUT DEALMAS WOMEN’S INSTITUTE</b><br/>DeAlmas is Spanish for “of the soul.” Founded in 1998 by psychologist, spiritual life coach, author and professor Gloria M. Rodriguez, DeAlmas Women’s Institute is dedicated to providing women and girls the opportunity to reclaim, honor, and express their divine feminine gifts, power and unique human potential. We offer workshops emphasizing spiritual and personal development within a holistic context, cultivating leadership and providing tools for self awareness and transformation. By<br/>reconnecting women and girls to their inherent feminine power, we impact broader communities and help create a more humane, just and compassionate world.<br/><br/>10% of all The GUAPA Project™ proceeds will be donated to an international women’s organization.<a href=""http://www.dealmas.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p><br/></p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> 
The DeAlmas Women’s Institute seeks funding to launch GUAPA Project™. The project will be completed in two phases. First, we will produce a photographic exhibit and video entitled The Guapalogues featuring the stories of Latina leaders and innovators in the greater New York area. This portion of the project is expected to premiere during Women’s History Month in March 2015. In the second phase of the project, The Guapalogues video will be adapted into a theatrical production and a companion coffee table book will be published.<br/><br/>The total estimated cost of the project is $31,000. We are seeking support to raise the initial $21,000. Funds raised for The GUAPA Project will be used to compensate artists, photographer, videographer, and cover the costs of a venue, production staff, marketing materials, and more.<br/><br/>Several elements of the project are already in production. We have selected the first group of women to be featured. They are educators, artists, institution builders, politicians, social entrepreneurs, media trailblazers, and community activists. Each honoree represents a unique quality of Guapa and is helping us translate it into photographs and narratives. A poetry performance video capturing the essence of the project has already been produced to aid in marketing and fundraising efforts for the project. Your support will help us meet the milestones outlined below:<br/><br/><b>MILESTONES<br/>Phase I (June 2014 – February 2015)</b><br/><ul>
<li>Launch fundraising and marketing campaign</li>
<li>Produce promotional video</li>
<li>Design and commission a photo exhibition</li>
<li>Develop personal development workshops titled, Guapa (Re)defined</li>
<li>Production and post-production of the Guapalogues video</li>
<li>Plan and produce The GUAPA Project™ premiere event in March 2015</li>
</ul><b><br/>Phase II (March 2015 – June 2015)</b><br/><ul>
<li>The GUAPA Project™ premiere in New York City (includes photo exhibition, Guapalogues video, honoree presentations, musical performance and surprise guests)<br/>
</li>
<li>Public offering of the Guapa (Re)defined workshops to community groups and colleges</li>
<li>Selection of photographs for coffee table book</li>
<li>Continued work on Guapalogues video production</li>
</ul><br/>Each donation will bring us closer to our goal of celebrating the Latina experience and the Guapa essence. We lovingly thank all our contributors in advance. All Guapa donors will be acknowledged in printed materials.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>A potential challenge is securing a cost-effective venue to host the photographic exhibit, screen The Guapalogues video and stage musical and spoken word performances. We are exploring several options (theaters, galleries and cultural centers) that may be viable options.<br/><br/><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help

I am honing in on my comedic timing and learning more about myself as a performer every day. <br/></p><p>Every day is a day for me to experiment in my own ideas and ways to make the audience giggle or gasp in horror.

On the way up to the stage, I tripped, everyone laughed, and I didn't perform the song. 
Every day since then, it is my goal to trip and still perform - and to acknowledge the beauty in tripping. My name is Katie Piatt. I am 26 and I am a performance artist/sculptor living and working in Portland, OR. I attend graduate school at the Pacific Northwest College of Art, and hope to gain my MFA in Visual Studies as of May 2015. I was recently accepted into the amazing Banff Centre's ""Confuse the Cat with Michael Portnoy and Ieva Misevičiūtė"" 6 week comedy & performance residency in Canada.   [http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx...]I didn't know I was a performer until I had a mentor (and now friend) inform me during a studio visit in September 2013. ""You tell stories, Katie. The way you speak about your life - you're a storyteller. You're a thousand characters. I know what your second grade teacher looks like even though I don't know what she looks like. Because of the way you tell it."" - Nan Curtis[https://vimeo.com/86873607]So I started telling stories about my life. Really personal (once I went on a date and the guy brought his roommate's kid brother), hard (being the fat, funny girl in a religious, midwest Missouri town), darkly funny (retelling my dad's list of ""things girls can't do""), and dressing in drag (of either gender) to do so (my Male Self's name is Will Harding - he has his own facebook - https://www.facebook.com/will.harding.9235 ). [https://vimeo.com/84998205]I became addicted. I AM addicted. I started creating characters or becoming what I thought a certain character would be like at a specific stage in their life (like Little Orphan Annie as a broke, awkward adult I call ""Old Annie"" or viewers have called ""Granny Annie""). [https://vimeo.com/93084354]I am interested in the role of gender on character, gender as performance, and where the awkward silence and laughter live. I am honing in on my comedic timing and learning more about myself as a performer every day. Every day is a day for me to experiment in my own ideas and ways to make the audience giggle or gasp in horror. I want to break down the barrier between audience and performer and create a discussion on the topics at hand (gender, feminism, equality) through all of our stories - our storytelling. FAST FORWARD>>>>>I got into the Banff Residency. When I found out, I fangirl ""Beatles are in the US"" jumped up and down in my room for almost ten minutes. I am so excited and honored. They are generously paying 43% of my tuition to get there, but I need to meet the full 100% of funding by August 15, 2014. (the residency is from September 14 - October 24, 2014)I need to go to this residency, and here's why:I believe that working with these artists [Michael Portnoy and Ieva Misevičiūtė] will be a life changing experience for me.

 ABOUT ME:  I began my artistic
endeavors in the late sixties by writing poetry and then making pottery for 4
years.  After a number of events,
(getting married and raising 4 great kids, etc.) in 1989 I created the world's
first line of Braille Jewelry.  I am
proud to share that one pair of my Harmony Serenity Earrings has been placed
into the permanent collection of the American History Museum at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington D.C.  In 2002 I
started doing manhole cover rubbings (similar to the grave stone rubbings
people have been doing for years.)  I have
a large collection of rubbings from around the US, Canada, England and France.  My work has been shown in Hanover, NH (the
home of Dartmouth college); in Manhattan, in the Lobby of the SEC Headquarters
in Washington D.C. and in England. It is in corporate and private collections
throughout the U.S.  Around 2007 I
created a series of photographic images called ""The Amazing Art of Rip and
Tear from the London Underground.""  These,
a series titled ""Tar Art"" and my photography can be seen at <a href=""http://www.kimchristiansen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kimchristiansen.com</a> </p>

As artists and Art Therapists, our goal was to bring the community together through art making. We worked with a local non-government organization (NGO) <i>Viva Nicaragua</i> and with community leaders to identify strengths and needs of the small community, which was originally a squatters community due to the yearly flooding of the banks of Lake Nicaragua. Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in Central America, and schools and communities rely heavily on the support of NGOs and volunteers from around the world.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/489066/files/20140406213838-IMG_0367.jpg?1396845518"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Before entering the community, we spoke directly with our NGO director and a community leader about Nicaragua's history and culture, learned about locally produced art materials that would be available for continued use, and identified significant historical themes that might be meaningful for the community to explore through art. We also worked with local teachers and psychologists to facilitate discussions on the power of art making. The community members who chose to participate were divided into groups: young boys, young girls, women, and elders. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/491703/files/20140407191536-ipad-Nicaragua_101.jpg?1396923336"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We facilitated community art making each morning, inviting the small groups to discuss their experiences and the stories they shared. At the end of the second week, the Art Therapists worked with the community to help create a small exhibit to showcase the art. Themes included shields, exploring personal, family, and community identity; masks, highlighting cultural and historical narratives; and dolls/figures, focusing on personal strength and empowerment. <br/><p></p><p>The young leader of the community facilitated a discussion engaging the young and old about what was learned about self and the community through art making.

<li>$120 each for supplies/miscellaneous expenses ($120 x 8 = $960)</li>

The Impact
This project facilitates art making, processing about the art with Art Therapists, storytelling, and discussion within communities and amongst local leaders, educators, and psychologists in Nicaragua.
Since her first trip to Nicaragua in January 2013, doctoral student Amy Hill has spoken to undergraduate and graduate classes, and at roundtable discussions, to share the importance of cultural sensitivity when working with multicultural and/or international communities. Her focus is on empowering small communities.
Professors Amy Backos and Gwen Sanders will provide lectures and art making opportunities to university professors and social service workers in Nicaragua so they can implement healing arts into their work. They continue to expand the International program at NDNU by offering graduate students opportunities to travel while implementing service learning projects to increase multicultural education and clinical experiences.

This means that they attract one another (or any metal surface), becoming the centre-piece of your desktop. Colouring is only the beginning! 
  
 
 
  
Over the past year we fine-tuned every aspect of the design. Quality, and Simplicity have been our top priorities. Right from the start, we aimed to make the best pens at the best price.
 
 
Magnetips Are:

Refillable: reusable pens with easy to replace quality fine-line refills.
Comfortable: wide ergonomic hex shape makes long hours of gripping easy on the hand. 
Water based : Water based ink is Healthier (and smells better too).
Accurate: Metal encased fine-line quality 0.4 nib. 
Magnetic: life-long lasting rare-earth Neodymium magnets inside. 
Safe :Incorporated air-flow vents. These makes our pens safer and child-friendly. 
Long Lasting: Durable and strong  high quality polymer body.

The principles behind the design of this set are innovative yet simple and reliable, allowing adults and children to enjoy writing and playing safely in countless new ways. We noticed that when unused, most of our favourite colouring pens just added to our desk clutter. When finished, they become useless, resulting in a large amount of waste added to our garbage pile.  So…we set down at Typica and thought how we could do better. We ended up designing a beautiful and refillable set of pens that not only writes and colours beautifully, but also helps to reduce waste.
 
 But we didn't stop there. By adding two super strong Neodymium magnets to each of our pens, we gave the pens a life of their own, making each set into an object in its own right, both useful and playful in countless ways, even beyond colouring, sketching, and writing. 

 We would love MAGNETIPS to be the centre-piece of your desk. That’s why we have designed two sets: ""Black Edition"" and ""Colour Edition"", both contain all of our 20 colour refills. All pledges are for either the ""Colour Edition"" or ""Black Edition""or both- After you order, we will send you a ""Backer Survey"" to verify which edition you chose.Black EditionColour EditionBlack EditionColour Edition The sets are of equal quality and dimensions, so the pens from both will attract to one another.

Twist ItStand ItRoll ItLove It The balls will be made to our specifications. They are made of chrome-plated steel, and they will not rust or tarnish for a very long time. They are not magnetic on their own (which makes them much safer) but “ferromagnetic,” which means they will strongly attract our pens and any other magnet.Let’s take a closer look at the details of our pens:The structure is divided into three main parts: pen barrel (body), barrel cap, and lid. The magnets are mechanically locked inside, so cannot come out accidentally.We kept the number of parts to a minimum. Simple and reliable.General DimensionsIn each pen, we will be using two super strong axially magnetised rare-Earth magnets.Neodymium magnets are the strongest and most permanent magnets known. Typically they will only lose less than 1% of their strength over 10 years: not enough for you to notice unless you have very sensitive measuring equipment. They won't even lose their strength if they are held in repelling or attracting positions with other magnets over long periods of time.The magnet in the pen lid and the magnet in the pen body are fixed in opposite polarities. This ensures the lid will always be attracted to the pen body. . 
 
In the GIF above we have played around with a magnetic field detecting sheet (yes, they exist!). It clearly shows the strong magnetic field when placed over the pens. Thank you for your support!  Interested in featuring our story? in this LINK you will find everything you need, including a press release and High Res. images.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><a href=""http://controlledburnreno.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""CB Web Home"">Controlled Burn, Inc.</a> is an all-inclusive, 100% volunteer driven organization that formed in the year 2000 to bring fire dancing to the greater Truckee Meadows region. Members initially travelled to San Francisco to learn the art and bring it back to our community. Now in its 12th year, Controlled Burn has a reputation for big choreography, big fire, accessibility and setting the standard for safe, public fire performance. Recognized as a federally tax-exempt educational 501(c)3 and 509(a)2 charitable organization, Controlled Burn performs throughout the community at both paid and non-paid performances including arts events and many, many charity events. For the past four years, Controlled Burn has produced Compression! Art and Fire, a unique, innovative, fiery festival.</p>
<p>July 28, 2012 marks the 5th anniversary of Compression! Art and Fire, a completely unique and amazing festival that takes place in downtown Reno as part of the 17th annual Artown Celebration. </p>
<p>Our event will run from 3p.m. to 11 p.m. The festival day begins with interactive playshops and progresses into the performance aspect of the event, culminating in a live musical performance and dance party.</p>
<p>Demonstrations include local artists and performers including <a href=""http://ashaworlddancers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Asha Web"">Asha World Dancers</a> with live music by <a href=""http://www.envisionarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Envision Web"">eNVision Performing Arts</a> and <a href=""http://www.blackrockcityallstars.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""BRC All-Stars web"">Black Rock City All-Stars</a> and friends. Performances will be held throughout the event and will include fire and non-fire performance artists from the Western states. Titillating visual displays of many of the different ways humans interact with fire will occur during this event.   </p>
<p>Since the dawn of time, humankind has been fascinated by fire in all its guises and Controlled Burn wants to share that amazing and varied fire-inspired artistic expression! It's generally restricted to a certain nearby desert during seven days of the year in the Fall, but we hope to give you a tiny piece in an urban environment.</p>
<p>Our festival allows community members to experience fire arts in a safe and controlled environment. It is designed to serve the community at-large and specifically at-risk youth and people of varying physical ability, age and ethnic diversity. This year, we hope to expand our closure of Virginia Street to add EVEN MORE art vehicles...and we aren't sure what all yet, stay tuned, we will update as details become available.</p>
<p>Our event is 100% volunteer worked, performed, and maintained, a true rarity today! It's a way for us to give back to our community for them supporting us all year long.  </p>
<p>With ever-decreasing grant funding and ever-increasing costs to produce an event like this, it has become necessary for us to use non-traditional ways to fund this amazing event. Our event is free and open to the public, with premium seating available for a nominal fee.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of Compression's BASIC budget:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are looking for YOUR help to make the 5th year of Compression the most amazing yet! Since this is our 5th, we want it to be bigger, have more performers from more areas of our region, and more art for you all to see. In addition to the faithful performers like <a href=""http://www.vulcancrew.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Vulcan Crew Web"">VULCAN CREW</a> who have been with us since the beginning, we want to bring two larger groups of fire performers, one from the BAY AREA and one from OREGON! We also want to expand the fire art garden to feature even more artists than last year.</p>
<p>Additionally, this funding will allow us to close a LARGER portion of Virginia Street, to Second Street to be able to expand your pre-playa experience to include more art vehicles. Not going to the playa this year? Then Compression is the perfect place to experience the same sort of vibe without the dust!</p>
<p>With less in grant funding and continuing economic trials in the state of Nevada, this is our chance to ""blow off a little steam"" and make an amazing party for our community!</p>
<p>All funds raised will be expended specifically for Compression.</p>
<p>Not reaching this funding goal means less of everything and a very real chance this could be the last Fire Festival.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is working capitol. It takes a lot to make an event like Compression happen, and none of it is cheap and a lot of it has to happen before the event.</p>
<p>See the sponsorship levels to the side to understand the different levels and what you will receive for supporting Compression. Of course, we also hope anyone supporting us will come out and celebrate with us the day of the festival!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The most important way you can help is by SHARING THIS CAMPAIGN with friends, family, and others that might be interested.</p>
<p>Have extra firewood hanging around? Many of our fire artists have live-fuel pieces, many of which are artistic and beautiful burn barrels. We need to feed these flames for folks to enjoy them so if you have extra wood you didn't use this year, please let us know, we'd be happy to take it off your hands and ensure it meets a fiery and combustive end!</p>
<p>If you'd like to volunteer for the event, we always need more people the day of, so please contact donna (at) controlledburnreno (dot) com. She's the amazing volunteer coordinator. We need setup and teardown crew, cleanup, safety rangers, seat monitors and roaming staff to make sure the event stays safe.</p>

<p>Nos dirigimos a ti con
la ilusión de llevar a cabo una <b>exposición</b>
<b>artística</b> en la que reflejaremos una
realidad que afecta a gran parte de los jóvenes españoles: <span><b>la</b> <b>emigración</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>La desesperación ante la falta de oportunidades laborales, la búsqueda
de un futuro mejor y la situación política de nuestro país han empujado y
siguen empujando a miles de jóvenes al exilio. </span>Queremos plasmar esta realidad en arte, y para
eso necesitamos tu ayuda.</p>
<p>Las artistas, <b>Isabel</b> y <b>Marta</b>, retratarán a varios jóvenes españoles emigrados a Dublín y <b>expondrán</b> <b>los</b> <b>retratos junto con sus
historias personales</b>. (La exposición tendrá lugar en la sala Culture Box de
Temple Bar, Dublín, a partir del 25 de junio de 2014 y durante 3 días).</p>
<p><span>Hemos calculado un <b>presupuesto</b>
<b>de</b> <b>650</b> <b>euros</b> que se
destinará <b>íntegramente</b>  cubrir los gastos de este proyecto, tales
como material artístico (pinceles, papel, pintura, etc.), la comisión de la
sala de exposiciones y los gastos de difusión (flyers, tarjetas de visita) y de esta campaña.</span></p>
<p><span>Toda aportación es bienvenida, 2 €, 5 €, 10 €… ¡o más si puedes! Y si no
puedes colaborar con dinero, ayúdanos <b>dándole
difusión a esta campaña</b> en las redes sociales, entre tus amigos... Si no
llegásemos a los 650, el importe que se recaude se destinará a cubrir parte de
los gastos.</span></p>

<p><span>El objetivo de esta exposición es poner de manifiesto la problemática en
que se encuentra la juventud española y dar visibilidad a los testimonios de
nuestros emigrantes, a sus experiencias, a los obstáculos vividos y también a
las oportunidades que muchos hemos encontrado fuera.</span></p>
<p><span>Porque no somos un número, porque tenemos nombre y apellidos, familia,
pareja y amigos que hemos dejado atrás. Porque detrás de cada retrato, hay una
historia y unos sueños de vivir, de avanzar, de progresar.</span><br/><br/><span>El proyecto tiene página y evento de Facebook y

Nos dirigimos a ti con
la ilusión de llevar a cabo una exposición
artística en la que reflejaremos una
realidad que afecta a gran parte de los jóvenes españoles: la emigración.
La desesperación ante la falta de oportunidades laborales, la búsqueda
de un futuro mejor y la situación política de nuestro país han empujado y
siguen empujando a miles de jóvenes al exilio. Queremos plasmar esta realidad en arte, y para
eso necesitamos tu ayuda.
Las artistas, Isabel y Marta, retratarán a varios jóvenes españoles emigrados a Dublín y expondrán los retratos junto con sus
historias personales. (La exposición tendrá lugar en la sala Culture Box de
Temple Bar, Dublín, a partir del 25 de junio de 2014 y durante 3 días).
Hemos calculado un presupuesto
de 650 euros que se
destinará íntegramente  cubrir los gastos de este proyecto, tales
como material artístico (pinceles, papel, pintura, etc.), la comisión de la
sala de exposiciones y los gastos de difusión (flyers, tarjetas de visita) y de esta campaña.
Toda aportación es bienvenida, 2 €, 5 €, 10 €… ¡o más si puedes! Y si no
puedes colaborar con dinero, ayúdanos dándole
difusión a esta campaña en las redes sociales, entre tus amigos... Si no
llegásemos a los 650, el importe que se recaude se destinará a cubrir parte de
los gastos.
¡Colabora y difunde!

Más sobre el proyecto ES-Patriados
El objetivo de esta exposición es poner de manifiesto la problemática en
que se encuentra la juventud española y dar visibilidad a los testimonios de
nuestros emigrantes, a sus experiencias, a los obstáculos vividos y también a
las oportunidades que muchos hemos encontrado fuera.
Porque no somos un número, porque tenemos nombre y apellidos, familia,
pareja y amigos que hemos dejado atrás. Porque detrás de cada retrato, hay una
historia y unos sueños de vivir, de avanzar, de progresar.El proyecto tiene página y evento de Facebook y
blog, donde encontrarás más información:

<h3>Briefly</h3>
<p>The Acavallo carousel is an actualized dream-sketch of metal, wood, and rope ship, with life size horses that go up and down.  It's self propelled, with big agricultural tires and an airbag suspension for lots of bounce and sway.  Its got a stage on the back (which doubles as a lounge), a catwalk above the deck for the brave, masts and ropes to climb for the braver yet.  The whole ship is interactive, is complete in its piratical detail.  The hard edges of the horses, the soft curves of the ropes, the worn wood planking and the rusted patina speak to its hard-partying experience.  This ship rocks.  It's meant to.  It inspires, it amuses, it transforms.  And - it's so much fun!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530825979/ixc8h2wnn4tuzede6be8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And, it's a work of many - it has been built through thousands of volunteer hours, paid for by thousands of volunteer dollars!  Truly, by the people, for the people.  And we want to bring it back for more! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530830518/lvqbv1rarhzcoajyzmrr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm setting the goal for $5,000, but as always, the more we raise the bigger the party.  And it will cost us more than that - to be sure.  It always costs 10k to get it out... but 5k would blunt the pain.  This year the big expenses are </p>
<p>$1,250 - &gt; diesel, gasoline, propane.  This is to get it down there and back (we're a ways away, and it's 8 mpg towing it), gasoline for driving it around, and propane for burning all week long.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530829918/nihlffts1g2fpgjpejkl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>$2,500 -&gt; rent and electricity for two months at the shop (<a href=""http://www.hydemade.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hydemade.com</a>).  All work must come to a halt, but the bills keep coming.  This is the hardest part for me, keeping the shop paid for and the kids fed while we do the artcar.  </p>
<p>$1,250 -&gt; mechanical parts (transmission, wiring, lighting) - and this is an underestimate for sure!  But that's the minimum to throw at it.  Actually, I know it's an underestimate because I've already spent more than that on new motive power for the horses.  </p>
<p>If we can raise more, we'll spend it wisely - and quickly.  Additional systems that could use money - the sound system, trailer lighting, the flame effects, it's all waiting for more attention.  And if we can raise even more, I'd love to take the opportunity to get it ready for a cross-country voyage, back to Brooklyn where it was born!  Dreams.  I've got 'em.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The carousel is a unique piece of burning man art, and much loved everywhere she goes.  We bring a special blend of joy, irreverence, and carefree honesty to the playa.   Our mission to set people free to have a good time, to stop thinking and just enjoy the experience of the moment, to express themselves as only they can.  The ship is a special place - graceful &amp; serene on a sunrise tour, sexy, sweaty, and burning at night.   And open to all, any time of the day.  We stop for anyone, for everyone, we demand you get on! It's an equal opportunity artcar, a place for all to find freedom.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530829993/qlnhuautqetrpdlluom6.jpg"" src=""""/>e</p>
<p>We come to interact, to enable, to spread magic. We're always up for impromptu celebrations and performances! So if you've got a show, flag us down, we'll do it up.  We've DJd art installations - provided sound reinforcement for mime shows - hosted weddings - fashion shoots - given wheelchair burners art tours (we've got a ramp) - anything goes.  Sometimes we'll even drive you home.  Doesn't hurt to ask!  </p>
<p>By funding this for the playa, you also enable it to exist in the real world - when it's working, we bring it to local events, transforming our small rural town into an art-fest at every opportunity.  It has a huge impact!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530830153/cilo71quchxmhhhywknt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>The Ship </strong></h2>
<p>The ship is completely custom, and designed and built specifically to sail the playa sea.  It's detail is 3 dimensional - there is no pretend, it's real.  The rigging, the mechanics, every bolt serves a purpose.  There are elements of whimsy, and fancy, but all in careful balance with raw functionality, ropes and cables balancing steel masts and crosstrees.  It's beautiful, and so satisfyingly dynamic yet strong as it bounces and weaves across the desert.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530830292/wp7jhgadlw4iu6gkvik4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The horses are wonderful - stark, ethereal, but up for anything - you can load 'em up with as many people as will fit.  You can stand on them, dance on them, they're sturdy!  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530830266/nwx3s0xx9udus06dejkj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And if you ever get bored with going up and down you can climb up on the catwalk and relax, take in the sights while the ship sways beneath.   String a hammock while you're at it!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530830321/jgldcjxnige5eyjzouvk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> Or climb out on one of the horse-poles and go up and down 17' off the ground.  And if you're braver yet, shimmy up the main masts and get a real look around.  </p>
<p>Climb down the ladder or slide down the ropes to the deck - you can experience the ship on your terms.  If you're comfortable, we're comfortable, get your groove on.  But if you can't make it up the rickety, scary, twisty log-chain ladder, you better just find a pillow on the stage and chill out!  It's all good.</p>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Briefly
The Acavallo carousel is an actualized dream-sketch of metal, wood, and rope ship, with life size horses that go up and down.  It's self propelled, with big agricultural tires and an airbag suspension for lots of bounce and sway.  Its got a stage on the back (which doubles as a lounge), a catwalk above the deck for the brave, masts and ropes to climb for the braver yet.  The whole ship is interactive, is complete in its piratical detail.  The hard edges of the horses, the soft curves of the ropes, the worn wood planking and the rusted patina speak to its hard-partying experience.  This ship rocks.  It's meant to.  It inspires, it amuses, it transforms.  And - it's so much fun!

And, it's a work of many - it has been built through thousands of volunteer hours, paid for by thousands of volunteer dollars!  Truly, by the people, for the people.  And we want to bring it back for more! 


What We Need & What You Get
I'm setting the goal for $5,000, but as always, the more we raise the bigger the party.  And it will cost us more than that - to be sure.  It always costs 10k to get it out... but 5k would blunt the pain.  This year the big expenses are 
$1,250 - > diesel, gasoline, propane.  This is to get it down there and back (we're a ways away, and it's 8 mpg towing it), gasoline for driving it around, and propane for burning all week long.

$2,500 -> rent and electricity for two months at the shop (www.hydemade.com).  All work must come to a halt, but the bills keep coming.  This is the hardest part for me, keeping the shop paid for and the kids fed while we do the artcar.  
$1,250 -> mechanical parts (transmission, wiring, lighting) - and this is an underestimate for sure!  But that's the minimum to throw at it.  Actually, I know it's an underestimate because I've already spent more than that on new motive power for the horses.  
If we can raise more, we'll spend it wisely - and quickly.  Additional systems that could use money - the sound system, trailer lighting, the flame effects, it's all waiting for more attention.  And if we can raise even more, I'd love to take the opportunity to get it ready for a cross-country voyage, back to Brooklyn where it was born!  Dreams.  I've got 'em.  

The Impact
The carousel is a unique piece of burning man art, and much loved everywhere she goes.  We bring a special blend of joy, irreverence, and carefree honesty to the playa.   Our mission to set people free to have a good time, to stop thinking and just enjoy the experience of the moment, to express themselves as only they can.  The ship is a special place - graceful & serene on a sunrise tour, sexy, sweaty, and burning at night.   And open to all, any time of the day.  We stop for anyone, for everyone, we demand you get on! It's an equal opportunity artcar, a place for all to find freedom.  
e
We come to interact, to enable, to spread magic. We're always up for impromptu celebrations and performances! So if you've got a show, flag us down, we'll do it up.  We've DJd art installations - provided sound reinforcement for mime shows - hosted weddings - fashion shoots - given wheelchair burners art tours (we've got a ramp) - anything goes.  Sometimes we'll even drive you home.  Doesn't hurt to ask!  
By funding this for the playa, you also enable it to exist in the real world - when it's working, we bring it to local events, transforming our small rural town into an art-fest at every opportunity.  It has a huge impact!

The Ship 
The ship is completely custom, and designed and built specifically to sail the playa sea.  It's detail is 3 dimensional - there is no pretend, it's real.  The rigging, the mechanics, every bolt serves a purpose.  There are elements of whimsy, and fancy, but all in careful balance with raw functionality, ropes and cables balancing steel masts and crosstrees.  It's beautiful, and so satisfyingly dynamic yet strong as it bounces and weaves across the desert.

The horses are wonderful - stark, ethereal, but up for anything - you can load 'em up with as many people as will fit.  You can stand on them, dance on them, they're sturdy!  

And if you ever get bored with going up and down you can climb up on the catwalk and relax, take in the sights while the ship sways beneath.   String a hammock while you're at it!

 Or climb out on one of the horse-poles and go up and down 17' off the ground.  And if you're braver yet, shimmy up the main masts and get a real look around.  
Climb down the ladder or slide down the ropes to the deck - you can experience the ship on your terms.  If you're comfortable, we're comfortable, get your groove on.  But if you can't make it up the rickety, scary, twisty log-chain ladder, you better just find a pillow on the stage and chill out!  It's all good.

<h2><b>About this campaign</b></h2>
<p>Hi! This is Etta Chan an illustrator from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I plan to hold an exhibition “100 Faces Under an Umbrella” and publish a book of the art shown in the exhibition.</p>
<p>I drew 100 portraits of protesters during the Umbrella Movement, a protests to fight for universal suffrage Hong Kong .I hope to fund the cost of the exhibition and the print run of the book to allow me to spread the stories of the fight for democracy in Hong Kong.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Background</b></h3>
<p>In mid-September 2014, a group of Hong Kong students started a student strike in order to express their will of universal suffrage in 2017. The student leaders began protesting outside the government headquarters on 22 September .On 28 September, a civil disorbedience campaign begun. .The number of protesters peaked at more than 100,000, they blocked main road in Admiralty. Police used pepper spray and tear gas against the crowds, and the protesters humble used umbrellas to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The umbrella became a symbol of demand for fair selection of the Chief Executive in Hong Kong, therefore the protest is called tje Umbrella Movement.</p>
<p>The movement is still ongoing, over ten thousand protesters occupied the heart of Admiralty, and part of Causeway Bay and Mong Kok.</p>

<h3>
<b>The Book</b> </h3>
<p>The book will printed by local print studio,who will pore over every detail of the design. “100 Face Under an Umbrella” will be around 208 pages, a portrait on one page, and one story per portrait.The illustrations will be Risograph printing. Risograph is designed to bridge the gap between offset printing and screen-printing. Through the platen roller, ink goes on paper through the screen of the drum and image is therefore printed. This technique not only ensures clear and sharp color output, but also gives a unique nostalgic feeling to the work. Risograph printing is not common in print companies; I found the only Risograph printing studio “Print Studio Ink’chacha” to print this high quality book. Due to the  cost of Risograph is not cheap, I plan to print the first edition in 2 colour, black and yellow(the theme colour of the Umbrella movement), which matchs my style of work. Some of my works in others colour will show greyscale in the book. Protester’s stories will be write in English and Chinese, I will write about ten thousands words of Chinese to portray the stories of the protestors and translate into English afterwards to let more people to know the story. </p>

</div></div>","About this campaign
Hi! This is Etta Chan an illustrator from Hong Kong.
I plan to hold an exhibition “100 Faces Under an Umbrella” and publish a book of the art shown in the exhibition.
I drew 100 portraits of protesters during the Umbrella Movement, a protests to fight for universal suffrage Hong Kong .I hope to fund the cost of the exhibition and the print run of the book to allow me to spread the stories of the fight for democracy in Hong Kong.

Background
In mid-September 2014, a group of Hong Kong students started a student strike in order to express their will of universal suffrage in 2017. The student leaders began protesting outside the government headquarters on 22 September .On 28 September, a civil disorbedience campaign begun. .The number of protesters peaked at more than 100,000, they blocked main road in Admiralty. Police used pepper spray and tear gas against the crowds, and the protesters humble used umbrellas to protect themselves.
The umbrella became a symbol of demand for fair selection of the Chief Executive in Hong Kong, therefore the protest is called tje Umbrella Movement.
The movement is still ongoing, over ten thousand protesters occupied the heart of Admiralty, and part of Causeway Bay and Mong Kok.
For more detail : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_protests
Exhibition
 “100 Faces Under an Umbrella”'s exhibition will be held in Hong Kong in mid of March 2015 for two weeks. The venue is Art Gallery of Open Quote.
Address: Unit S401, Block A, PMQ, 35 Aberdeen Street, Central, Hong Kong

<p>Hello art lovers and supporters. My name is Rubi Lebovitch, and I am an art
photographer. Over the last 8 years, I have been working on a series of frames featuring
staged scenes - weird, “off”, absurd or uncanny – all happening at home. I call
it “Home Sweet Home”. My work consists of photos of manually and conceptually
manipulated objects, and is thus situated at the borderline between conceptual
art, installation and photography. My “Home Sweet Home” series has been widely exhibited, with several pieces held in public and private collections, and won several prizes,
including being chosen as one of <a href=""https://www.photolucida.org/critical-mass/top-50/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2015 Critical Mass Top

    The Impact 
At a time of increasing nuclear tensions on the world stage, and coming up on the 70th Anniversary (this August) on the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, H. D. Ivey’s sculptures force the viewer to confront the magnitude and scale of our nuclear age. The show requires the viewer to
confront and examine our contributions to the self-propagating narrative of M.A.D. (Mutually Assured Destruction), and to question the basis
of the mythology of vulnerability and power engendered in such delusions. Your contributions to making this exhibition possible create an educational opportunity for the public to revisit and to discuss the implications of nuclear power as embodied in these  amazing, large sculptures.

project, <b><i>Pinto mi barrio. Mejoro mi vida (Paint my hood, better my life),</i></b>
was a huge success and is sustained by the organization with whom I partnered.
I observed that the youth benefited from a creative and safe space to be
themselves, dream and learn (check out the results <a href=""http://muralaleph.wordpress.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>). Now, in 2013, five years after graduating from
Georgetown University as a Government major and Studio Art and Spanish minor, I
decided to leave my job as International Program Manager for a Dominican
non-profit and start my own business continuing projects like <b>Pinto mi barrio. Mejoro mi vida </b>that
use art-based learning and creative solutions for development. For my first project,
the Canalda Filomena Gonzalez Public School reached out to me and I WILL work as an independent consultant offering services in art-based facilitation, urban beautification
and community engagement. I need your support to get started. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For the School Beautification project, the Candalda Filomena Gonzalez students will participate in a workshop series and a 3 month
project where they will receive:</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">an opportunity to engage in art,</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">a platform to use their voices to create
ownership of their school,</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">a safe space to beautify their school yard by
helping to create and paint a mural (approximately 60ft by 6ft), and</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">an opportunity to think critically about who they
are and their goals.</span><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Canalda Filomena Gonzalez Public School</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>The Canalda Filomena Gonzalez Public School was founded within 3 decades ago, by
the Filomena Gonzalez family in a neighborhood where one did not exist and the
school continues to receive support from the founder’s family. Maria Filomena
Gonzalez, the founder’s daughter who sought my support, states, “The mural project will
benefit the students because it will create a more pleasant environment for
study. Also, it will develop artistic skills at the school, serve as an
opportunity for teachers to incorporate art, and it will integrate the
educational community.”</p>
<p></p>

<p></p></span><p>Since the public school identified a need for youth
engagement and a mural, this project will help me meet 2 goals: </p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Use a
collaborative community/client model</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. This project is a great opportunity because the Canalda Filomena Gonzalez public school wants to collaborate. The school is familiar with and have identified a need for my services in mural making and youth engagement. It’s a win-win and I want to work with clients who know the value of using art-based methods.</span><br/>

<h3><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Phases and Expected Impact</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For 3 months<b> 306 boys
and girls</b> from the Canalda Filomena Gonzalez public school will be
challenged to be creative. They will use art to express who they are, what
dreams they have and visualize the environments in which they thrive, feel
happy and youthful. Each of the project’s four phases are expected to make an
impact:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Phase I</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
– Needs Assessment: We will use </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">art based
facilitation </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">engage boys and
girls aged 4 to 13 in art </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and challenge them to think about who they are
and their environment critically.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Phase II</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> – Design: I will gather the
students art work and written responses and incorporate their voices in the
mural design to </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">provide a platform for
students to present their voice and own their public school space.</b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Phase III</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
– Design Transfer and Painting: The artists will transfer the design after receiving
the school’s approval and the </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">students
and staff will paint weekly and have a hand in transforming their school yard.</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
A sense of community and ownership will be reached.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Phase IV</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> – Inauguration: December 13,
2013, we will have a mural inauguration to dedicate the mural and honor student
participation and the stakeholders involved.</span>

<p><b>Deja una huella internacional proporcionando arte a
los estudiantes de escuelas públicas Dominicanas!</b></p>
<p><b>Sobre el proyecto:</b></p>
<p>En el 2010,
yo, (Xaivier Ringer, Consultora de Iniciativas Innovadoras &amp; Muralista
viviendo en la República Dominicana) diseñé y administré un proyecto utilizando
el proceso de hacer un mural para embellecer un espacio comunitario y
compenetrar a la juventud en Santo Domingo, República Dominicana. El proyecto, <b><i>Pinto
mi barrio, Mejoro mi vida,  </i></b>tuvo gran éxito y
es mantenido por la organización con la que me asocié para hacerlo.
Observé que los chicos se beneficiaron del hecho de contar con un espacio
creativo y que les motivaba a expresase, soñar y aprender (puedes ver los
resultados aquí <a href=""http://muralaleph.wordpress.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>here</span></a>). Ahora, en el 2013, cinco años
luego de graduarme de Georgetown University como Government major &amp; Studio
Art &amp; Spanish minor, decidí dejar mi empleo como Administradora de
Proyectos Internacionales, para irme a trabajar con una empresa Dominicana sin
fines de lucro e iniciar mi propio negocio a partir de la idea de hacer
proyectos como <b>Pinto mi barrio, Mejoro mi vida, </b>que usan el arte como medio para aprendizaje y soluciones creativas para
el desarrollo.<b> Para mi primer proyecto, </b>la Escuela Pública
Canalda Filomena González  me contactó y
trabajaré con ellos como consultora independiente, ofreciendo mis servicios
ayudando a crear un área destinada para el arte, embelleciendo la zona urbana y
conectando a la comunidad. Necesito tu apoyo para poder empezar!</p>
<p>Para el
proyecto de Embellecimiento de la Escuela, los estudiantes de Candalda Filomena
González participarán en una serie de talleres donde recibirán:</p>
<ol>
<li>La
     oportunidad de relacionarse con el arte,</li>
<li>Una
     plataforma para usar su voz y desarrollar sentido de empoderamiento de la
     escuela,</li>
<li>Un
     lugar seguro para embellecer el patio de la escuela, creando y pintando un
     mural (aproximadamente de 60pies x 6pies), y</li>
<li>La
     oportunidad de pensar críticamente sobre quiénes son ellos mismos y cuáles
     son sus metas.
</li>
</ol>
<p><b><span> La Escuela Canalda Filomena González </span></b></p>
<p>La Escuela
Pública Canalda Filomena González fue fundada hace 3 décadas por la familia Filomena
González en un vecindario donde no había escuelas y en la actualidad, siguen
recibiendo el apoyo de la familia fundadora. María Filomena González, la hija
de los fundadores, quien buscó mi apoyo, dice que “El proyecto del mural beneficiará  alos estudiantes porque creará un ambiente
mucho más agradable para los estudios. También desarrollará las habilidades
artísticas en la escuela, servirá como un medio para incorporar el arte y
finalmente, integrará a toda la comunidad educativa.”</p>
<p>Como la escuela identificó la
necesidad de integrar a la comunidad y el desarrollo de un mural, este proyecto
me ayudará a alcanzar 2 objetivos:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Usar un
     modelo colaborativo entre la comunidad y el cliente.</b> Este proyecto es una gran oportunidad porque
     la Escuela Pública Canalda Filomena González quiere colaborar.
     La escuela conoce mis servicios e identificaron la necesidad de crear el
     mural mientras se une e integra a la comunidad. Todos ganamos y yo quiero
     trabajar con clientes que valoran el uso de metodologías basadas en el arte.
     </li>
<li>
<b>El
     lanzamiento de mis servicios como Consultora de Iniciativas Innovadoras </b>(puedes
     ver mi página aquí <a href=""http://xzahveeair.wix.com/xaivierringer"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>here</span></a>)  así alimentar mi futuro proyecto sin
     fines de lucro en los Estados Unidos. Mi plan es trabajar en la República
     Dominicana y los Estados Unidos, proporcionando asesoramiento basado en el
     arte, embellecimiento de áreas públicas y servicios de integración de la
     comunidad.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Fases e impacto esperado</b></p>
<p>Durante 3
meses, <b>306 niños y niñas</b> de la Escuela Pública Canalda Filomena González
serán retados a desarrollar su creatividad. Usarán el arte para expresar
quienes son, los sueños que anhelan y visualizar ambientes en los que puedan
prosperar, sentirse felices y llenos de energía. Se espera que cada una de las
4 fases del proyecto tengan un impacto:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Fase I</b> – Evaluación
     de las necesidades: Utilizaremos un asesoramiento basado en arte para <b>involucrar
     niños y niñas de 4 a 13 años en arte y estimularlos a pensar críticamente
     sobre quiénes son y su ambiente. </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Fase II</b> – Diseño:
     Reuniré el trabajo artístico y las respuestas escritas de los estudiantes
     para incorporar sus voces en el diseño del mural y <b>proveer una plataforma para que los estudiantes presenten su
     pensar y se empoderen de su espacio escolar público</b>. </li>
<li>
<b>Fase
     III</b> – Transferir
     el diseño y pintura: Los artistas transferirán el diseño luego de que la
     escuela lo apruebe y <b>tanto los
     estudiantes como el staff pintarán semanalmente y se involucrarán en la
     transformación de su patio escolar.</b> </li>
<li>
<b>Fase IV</b> –
     Inauguración: Diciembre 13, 2013,  celebraremos la inauguración del mural
     para dedicarlo y honrar la participación de los estudiantes  y las personas envueltas en la
     inversión. </li>
</ul>
<p>Qué mejor
forma de entender el potencial del impacto que viendo los resultados de un
proyecto similar que ya he dirigido:     </p>
<p><b>Lo que necesitamos y tus beneficios</b></p>
<p>Al momento
hemos recaudado 20% de nuestros cotos totales. Si logramos los objetivos de la
campaña, usaremos los fondos para:</p>
<p><b>Talleres enfocados en arte </b>dirigidos
con la finalidad de que los estudiantes expresen su visión de un ambiente que
los estimule, cree felicidad y bienestar. Sus aportes serán incluidos en el
diseño. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Diseño
     del mural</b> por un artista y los materiales para crear el
     bosquejo e implementar la búsqueda de retroalimentación por parte de la
     comunidad. </li>
<li>
<b>Transporte
     </b>para
     los artistas y participantes. </li>
<li>
<b>Herramientas
     para el mural</b> (pintura, pinceles, pintura de base, sellador)
     que los artistas y estudiantes utilizarán para crear el mural. Las
     herramientas que sobren serán donadas a futuros proyectos como éste. </li>

Make an international impact providing art to Dominican public school students!
About the project:



In 2010, I, (Xaivier Ringer, Innovative Initiative
Consultant & international mural artist living in Dominican Republic)
designed and managed a project using the mural making process to beautify a
community space and engage youth in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The
project, Pinto mi barrio. Mejoro mi vida (Paint my hood, better my life),
was a huge success and is sustained by the organization with whom I partnered.
I observed that the youth benefited from a creative and safe space to be
themselves, dream and learn (check out the results here). Now, in 2013, five years after graduating from
Georgetown University as a Government major and Studio Art and Spanish minor, I
decided to leave my job as International Program Manager for a Dominican
non-profit and start my own business continuing projects like Pinto mi barrio. Mejoro mi vida that
use art-based learning and creative solutions for development. For my first project,
the Canalda Filomena Gonzalez Public School reached out to me and I WILL work as an independent consultant offering services in art-based facilitation, urban beautification
and community engagement. I need your support to get started. 

For the School Beautification project, the Candalda Filomena Gonzalez students will participate in a workshop series and a 3 month
project where they will receive:



an opportunity to engage in art,


a platform to use their voices to create
ownership of their school,


a safe space to beautify their school yard by
helping to create and paint a mural (approximately 60ft by 6ft), and


an opportunity to think critically about who they
are and their goals.



The Canalda Filomena Gonzalez Public School


The Canalda Filomena Gonzalez Public School was founded within 3 decades ago, by
the Filomena Gonzalez family in a neighborhood where one did not exist and the
school continues to receive support from the founder’s family. Maria Filomena
Gonzalez, the founder’s daughter who sought my support, states, “The mural project will
benefit the students because it will create a more pleasant environment for
study. Also, it will develop artistic skills at the school, serve as an
opportunity for teachers to incorporate art, and it will integrate the
educational community.”



Since the public school identified a need for youth
engagement and a mural, this project will help me meet 2 goals: 



Use a
collaborative community/client model. This project is a great opportunity because the Canalda Filomena Gonzalez public school wants to collaborate. The school is familiar with and have identified a need for my services in mural making and youth engagement. It’s a win-win and I want to work with clients who know the value of using art-based methods.


Launch my
services as an Innovative Initiative consultant (check out my site here)
and feed into my future U.S. based
non-profit. My plan is to work in the Dominican Republic and the United States providing art-based facilitation, beautification of public spaces and community engagement services.




Phases and Expected Impact



For 3 months 306 boys
and girls from the Canalda Filomena Gonzalez public school will be
challenged to be creative. They will use art to express who they are, what
dreams they have and visualize the environments in which they thrive, feel
happy and youthful. Each of the project’s four phases are expected to make an
impact:



Phase I
– Needs Assessment: We will use art based
facilitation to engage boys and
girls aged 4 to 13 in art and challenge them to think about who they are
and their environment critically.


Phase II – Design: I will gather the
students art work and written responses and incorporate their voices in the
mural design to provide a platform for
students to present their voice and own their public school space.


Phase III
– Design Transfer and Painting: The artists will transfer the design after receiving
the school’s approval and the students
and staff will paint weekly and have a hand in transforming their school yard.
A sense of community and ownership will be reached.


Phase IV – Inauguration: December 13,
2013, we will have a mural inauguration to dedicate the mural and honor student
participation and the stakeholders involved.



What better way to understand the potential impact than to see the results of a similar project I have lead:

      






What we need & your perks
 
Thus far we have raised 20% of our total costs. If we reach

inputs will be incorporated into the mural design.


Mural design
by artist and materials to create sketch and implement school community’s
feedback


Transportation

to create mural, remaining supplies will be donated to future public art
projects

Deja una huella internacional proporcionando arte a
los estudiantes de escuelas públicas Dominicanas!
Sobre el proyecto:
En el 2010,
yo, (Xaivier Ringer, Consultora de Iniciativas Innovadoras & Muralista
viviendo en la República Dominicana) diseñé y administré un proyecto utilizando
el proceso de hacer un mural para embellecer un espacio comunitario y
compenetrar a la juventud en Santo Domingo, República Dominicana. El proyecto, Pinto
mi barrio, Mejoro mi vida,  tuvo gran éxito y
es mantenido por la organización con la que me asocié para hacerlo.
Observé que los chicos se beneficiaron del hecho de contar con un espacio
creativo y que les motivaba a expresase, soñar y aprender (puedes ver los
resultados aquí here). Ahora, en el 2013, cinco años
luego de graduarme de Georgetown University como Government major & Studio
Art & Spanish minor, decidí dejar mi empleo como Administradora de
Proyectos Internacionales, para irme a trabajar con una empresa Dominicana sin
fines de lucro e iniciar mi propio negocio a partir de la idea de hacer
proyectos como Pinto mi barrio, Mejoro mi vida, que usan el arte como medio para aprendizaje y soluciones creativas para
el desarrollo. Para mi primer proyecto, la Escuela Pública
Canalda Filomena González  me contactó y
trabajaré con ellos como consultora independiente, ofreciendo mis servicios
ayudando a crear un área destinada para el arte, embelleciendo la zona urbana y
conectando a la comunidad. Necesito tu apoyo para poder empezar!
Para el
proyecto de Embellecimiento de la Escuela, los estudiantes de Candalda Filomena
González participarán en una serie de talleres donde recibirán:

La
     oportunidad de relacionarse con el arte,
Una
     plataforma para usar su voz y desarrollar sentido de empoderamiento de la
     escuela,
Un
     lugar seguro para embellecer el patio de la escuela, creando y pintando un
     mural (aproximadamente de 60pies x 6pies), y
La
     oportunidad de pensar críticamente sobre quiénes son ellos mismos y cuáles
     son sus metas.


 La Escuela Canalda Filomena González 
La Escuela
Pública Canalda Filomena González fue fundada hace 3 décadas por la familia Filomena
González en un vecindario donde no había escuelas y en la actualidad, siguen
recibiendo el apoyo de la familia fundadora. María Filomena González, la hija
de los fundadores, quien buscó mi apoyo, dice que “El proyecto del mural beneficiará  alos estudiantes porque creará un ambiente
mucho más agradable para los estudios. También desarrollará las habilidades
artísticas en la escuela, servirá como un medio para incorporar el arte y
finalmente, integrará a toda la comunidad educativa.”
Como la escuela identificó la
necesidad de integrar a la comunidad y el desarrollo de un mural, este proyecto
me ayudará a alcanzar 2 objetivos:


Usar un
     modelo colaborativo entre la comunidad y el cliente. Este proyecto es una gran oportunidad porque
     la Escuela Pública Canalda Filomena González quiere colaborar.
     La escuela conoce mis servicios e identificaron la necesidad de crear el
     mural mientras se une e integra a la comunidad. Todos ganamos y yo quiero
     trabajar con clientes que valoran el uso de metodologías basadas en el arte.
     

El
     lanzamiento de mis servicios como Consultora de Iniciativas Innovadoras (puedes
     ver mi página aquí here)  así alimentar mi futuro proyecto sin
     fines de lucro en los Estados Unidos. Mi plan es trabajar en la República
     Dominicana y los Estados Unidos, proporcionando asesoramiento basado en el
     arte, embellecimiento de áreas públicas y servicios de integración de la
     comunidad.

Fases e impacto esperado
Durante 3
meses, 306 niños y niñas de la Escuela Pública Canalda Filomena González
serán retados a desarrollar su creatividad. Usarán el arte para expresar
quienes son, los sueños que anhelan y visualizar ambientes en los que puedan
prosperar, sentirse felices y llenos de energía. Se espera que cada una de las
4 fases del proyecto tengan un impacto:


Fase I – Evaluación
     de las necesidades: Utilizaremos un asesoramiento basado en arte para involucrar
     niños y niñas de 4 a 13 años en arte y estimularlos a pensar críticamente
     sobre quiénes son y su ambiente. 


Fase II – Diseño:
     Reuniré el trabajo artístico y las respuestas escritas de los estudiantes
     para incorporar sus voces en el diseño del mural y proveer una plataforma para que los estudiantes presenten su
     pensar y se empoderen de su espacio escolar público. 

Fase
     III – Transferir
     el diseño y pintura: Los artistas transferirán el diseño luego de que la
     escuela lo apruebe y tanto los
     estudiantes como el staff pintarán semanalmente y se involucrarán en la
     transformación de su patio escolar. 

Fase IV –
     Inauguración: Diciembre 13, 2013,  celebraremos la inauguración del mural
     para dedicarlo y honrar la participación de los estudiantes  y las personas envueltas en la
     inversión. 

Qué mejor
forma de entender el potencial del impacto que viendo los resultados de un
proyecto similar que ya he dirigido:

<h3>Please help us reach our goal to bring Fringe 3 to Honolulu, Hawai'i.</h3>
<p>Aloha!</p>
<p>FRINGE in Honolulu is gearing up for another year!  Plans are in order and we are even more excited to showcase original and provocative works not only from Hawai‘i’s emerging local artists, but also from new dance, music, and theatre groups and solo performance artists from around the world. In the spirit of Fringe Festivals everywhere, O’ahu Fringe Festival is thrilled to embrace the performance world’s next avant-garde, the next un-categorized artist, and the next new wave-- the next Fringe Artist.</p>
<p>To fulfill our goal of hosting a delicious 4 days of new and engaging performances, we need your generous support.  Please share this page with your acquaintances, friends, and families.  Every donation is appreciated and will go a long way to make our all-volunteer O’ahu Fringe Festival a success.  Feel free to donate in more than one pledge tier to get multiple Fringe3 rewards, so you are ready to rock your Fringe at this year's festival!  Aloha.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>So where will the money go?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Fringe Events</li>
</ul>
<p>To offset additional costs needed during the actual season, we will be using monies from this campaign to fund events that will allow the artists to do a brief showcase of their work in the time leading up to Fringe!  These events will raise awareness and money so that we may provide better support for our artists during the actual Fringe weekend!</p>
<ul>
<li>Fringe Central</li>
</ul>
<p>Fringe needs a home base! This way the artists always have a place to check in with us, ask questions, meet other artists and audience members, get the word out about their shows and even perform!  With your donations we will be able to rent a location in the heart of Honolulu’s Arts District in order to serve the various artists and audience members who attend Fringe3. Whether it be directions, recommendations, troubleshooting, or a genuine theatre emergency, Fringe Central would not only give Fringe artists, staff, and volunteers a place to organize and plan, but it would also provide a place for the general public to better experience Fringe.   Your donations will help us with the permits/rental of the Fringe Central space, as well as office supplies, promotional materials, lights, sound, power, and first aid kits. </p>
<ul>
<li>Promotional Materials</li>

<p>We want to keep getting bigger and better. In order to do this we have to get the word out. Not only is it a service to Fringe Artists that EVERYONE in Hawai’i knows about O’ahu Fringe, but also it is a way for O’ahu Fringe to become a choice festival for performers.  Your donations will help us with our media drive in radio, TV, social media, and with the printing costs of promotional materials such as postcards, fliers, the Fringe Guide (the program all audience members and Fringe Artists receive, providing them with the schedule and location of acts), and advertising space in various media businesses. Plus, by expanding our connections to other Fringe Festivals our reach can grow far wide and more global, giving the artists more exposure, and hopefully making Hawai’i a Fringe Festival destination for audiences and artists alike.</p>
<p><strong>About O’ahu Fringe Festival</strong></p>
<p>O’ahu Fringe Festival is an annual, all-volunteer event with a focus on the celebration of the performing arts.  Shows are self-produced and application is open to anyone, with no restrictions on content.  So expect the unexpected.  In November 2011 in Chinatown Honolulu the very first festival kicked OFF – introducing the wonderful world of Fringe to the O’ahu community.  Acts ranged from original local circus arts, dance, acrobatics, improv, pole dancing, puppetry, belly dancing, circus sideshow, aerial arts, theatre, music, and cabaret to seasoned award winning plays and performances from near and far.  We welcome any artistic performances to be part of O’ahu Fringe as we continue to contribute to the vitality and wellbeing of the artistic community on our island.</p>
<p>The 2013 Festival will be staged this November on the 7th - 10th.  Thank you so much for your support.</p>

Aloha!
FRINGE in Honolulu is gearing up for another year!  Plans are in order and we are even more excited to showcase original and provocative works not only from Hawai‘i’s emerging local artists, but also from new dance, music, and theatre groups and solo performance artists from around the world. In the spirit of Fringe Festivals everywhere, O’ahu Fringe Festival is thrilled to embrace the performance world’s next avant-garde, the next un-categorized artist, and the next new wave-- the next Fringe Artist.
To fulfill our goal of hosting a delicious 4 days of new and engaging performances, we need your generous support.  Please share this page with your acquaintances, friends, and families.  Every donation is appreciated and will go a long way to make our all-volunteer O’ahu Fringe Festival a success.  Feel free to donate in more than one pledge tier to get multiple Fringe3 rewards, so you are ready to rock your Fringe at this year's festival!  Aloha.



So where will the money go?

Pre-Fringe Events

To offset additional costs needed during the actual season, we will be using monies from this campaign to fund events that will allow the artists to do a brief showcase of their work in the time leading up to Fringe!  These events will raise awareness and money so that we may provide better support for our artists during the actual Fringe weekend!

Fringe Central

Fringe needs a home base! This way the artists always have a place to check in with us, ask questions, meet other artists and audience members, get the word out about their shows and even perform!  With your donations we will be able to rent a location in the heart of Honolulu’s Arts District in order to serve the various artists and audience members who attend Fringe3. Whether it be directions, recommendations, troubleshooting, or a genuine theatre emergency, Fringe Central would not only give Fringe artists, staff, and volunteers a place to organize and plan, but it would also provide a place for the general public to better experience Fringe.   Your donations will help us with the permits/rental of the Fringe Central space, as well as office supplies, promotional materials, lights, sound, power, and first aid kits. 

Promotional Materials

We want to keep getting bigger and better. In order to do this we have to get the word out. Not only is it a service to Fringe Artists that EVERYONE in Hawai’i knows about O’ahu Fringe, but also it is a way for O’ahu Fringe to become a choice festival for performers.  Your donations will help us with our media drive in radio, TV, social media, and with the printing costs of promotional materials such as postcards, fliers, the Fringe Guide (the program all audience members and Fringe Artists receive, providing them with the schedule and location of acts), and advertising space in various media businesses. Plus, by expanding our connections to other Fringe Festivals our reach can grow far wide and more global, giving the artists more exposure, and hopefully making Hawai’i a Fringe Festival destination for audiences and artists alike.

I graduated from
Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver, British Columbia in May
2011. During my time at ECUAD I was also an active member of a feminist noise
group, Her Jazz Noise Collective. The collective organized monthly experimental
feminist performance arts nights at Video
In Video Out, where I performed on drums or makeshift percussions. After
performing three sets as a part of the Vancouver Art Galleryâ€™s Fuse program in
August of 2010, the collective is now focusing on releasing a compilation of
recordings to be released in 2012. 
 
At university, much
of my practice was dedicated to abstract painting. However this changed during
my last semester when I broke the ulna and radius bones of my left arm in a cycling
accident. Being right handed, I decided to complete the semester, cast and all,
asking for minimal help constructing supports. I saw this as an opportunity to
experiment with my own physical limitations and to use the canvas as a
self-supporting surface. This led to creating paintings that are more
sculptural with a painted reverse side where the colour reflects onto the wall
behind. Throughout this period, which I jokingly refer to as the
one-handed-two-footed period, I realized the potential of simplicity, gravity,
form and reflection, as well as my own ability to overcome physical challenges.

 
Furthermore, this
experience led me to re-examine specifically my own artistic interests: to
question my perceptions of professional sport culture and art culture,
particularly widespread public accessibility of sports versus the relative
inaccessibility of abstract and conceptual art. Rather than differences - since
most people are aware of the cultural gap between sports and art - I am
interested both in the similarities and aesthetics of both. As a child, I
enjoyed watching basketball and later as a teenager I played for several
basketball teams and likewise, with art, I grew up in an environment that was
very appreciative of art and design. In a recent exhibition I incorporated
elements of basketball through materials such as jersey fabric and backboard
inspired shapes. This work was also inspired by the playful abstract paintings
of artists like Mary Heilmann and Elizabeth Murray. Through this series, Learning to Shoot the Wrong Way, I chose
to observe the similarities and resulting a hybridization of basketball and
abstract art.
 
For the residency,
I propose to create a series of sculptures and paintings based on ideas derived

drawn to the idea that failure can be a success by chance and will and I am

further, disengaging the idea that success and failure are opposites. 

Where I am going?



Arteles is a non-profit creative centre and
international artist residency in HÃ¤meenkyrÃ¶, Finland. The organization is lead
by three Finnish artists, Teemu RÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Pekka Ruuska and Inga Mustakallio who
are all recognized conceptual artists in Finland. 

 
Arteles has an innovative approach to gallery
space: rather than having shows for three-week periods, the centre hosts
â€œspectacle spaces.â€ These are three-day interdisciplinary art shows that
encourage participants to exhibit both finished work, as well as works in
progress and provide opportunities for feedback from other artists in
residence, as well as artists and enthusiasts from nearby areas. 

 
This spring, Arteles
has organized an opportunity for visiting artists to give two short artist
talks at the Pori Art Museum in Pori as well as one at the TR1 Kunsthall in
Tampere.



The Impact


Having the time to
focus strictly on art for two months will greatly benefit the development of my
practice. I am currently interested in developing a stronger conceptual
direction in my work. By having two months dedicated to making art, I feel like
I will be able to focus on my goals as an artist.  Furthermore, I believe that by working with the three
Finnish artists as well as the other artists in residence, I will learn from
their perspective and critique. 
Meeting other
artists from other countries is very important to me because I consider it an
opportunity to learn from and exchange ideas with others, who may have very
different perspectives on art than what I am familiar with in Vancouver.
Furthermore, I think it will be beneficial towards my development to have
access to a community of artists who will be there to develop a project.
Continual engagement with other artists in the studio is something that my
practice has lacked since graduation and from my experience at University; I work
well in a communal studio. I feel that having these two months dedicated to
making art with other active artists will help me gain more confidence when
discussing my work.
While at the
residency, I have a chance to give two artists talks, one at the Pori Art
Museum. I am excited for this opportunity because the museum has shown works by
several Finnish artists whose work I am interested in, notably, Matti Kujasalo
and Timo Vaittinen, both of whom have shown work at the museum in 2011. I have
yet to give an artist talk outside of a classroom. I anticipate this
opportunity will be a worthwhile learning experience. 
After my trip, I will be able to share my
experience with other artists in Vancouver who are interested in the Arteles
Creative Centre. I plan to document my time at the residency through an online
journal or zine (a small self published magazine/book), which would be
available as a resource for other artists, writers and curators who are
interested in contemporary art from Finland and the Arteles Creative Centre. All donors contributing over $15 will receive a copy of the zine.   


What We Need & What You Get
I am fundraising to cover the cost of the residency. For two months at the residency, it will cost $1730.

The total amount I am aiming to reach is $1800. The extra $70 will be used for the zine production and mailing. 

I am in the process of applying for two grants through Canada Council for the Arts, which will hopefully help me fund my time in Finland.

Given that I receive a grant from the Canada Council, any extra funds raised through IndieGoGo will go towards funding the zine, my stomach and art supplies.

whites only”, we will let people feel social injustice related to
gender issues in Italy. How? 

Throughout
Torino, the once Italian capital city, we will scatter some couples
of benches, each composed of:
one
4 seater bench “men only”
one
1 seater bench “women only” 

Each
couple of benches represents a “discrimination area” like the
parliament, at work, at home etc; they will graphically represent
each environment and will carry a brief explanation text.


The Impact
Where
are you allowed to sit
and which seat do you really want to take?
We
will encourage
people to take a seat and will take a picture of all those who want
to register their disagreement or protest against gender
discrimination. Pictures and comments will be uploaded on the
internet, stay tuned to learn about our web pages.

Our
group is strongly committed to finding new social communication tools
and effective means of expression; we believe that humour and
provocation can stimulate people to re-think their perceptions and
overcome stereotypes.

What We Need & What You Get


The
Turin city council is eager to welcome our installation but cannot
find the total budget to help us out. We wonder why there is
less and less money for gender issues in Italy!
Carpenters,
smiths, designers: we do need these artisans and professionals to
create appealing street furniture able to attract and intrigue
people.
The
money you donate will be used to pay the manual craftmanship of our
benches and to pay for all city permits.
Based
on
our budget we will duplicate our installation in several  sites
throughout the city; if we don't reach our goal we may be able to
build a single prototype

TALKING
STREET FURNITURE...

...elementi
di arredo urbano raccontano il “gender gap”! 

L'obiettivo
dell'iniziativa è illustrare visivamente il “gender gap”
(disparità di condizione tra uomini e donne) e proporre una
provocazione per rappresentare uno spaccato della società italiana
rispetto la (DIS)uguaglianza tra uomini e donne.

Realizzeremo
degli interventi urbani, installazioni fisse per stimolare la
partecipazione dei passanti e attivare una riflessione da parte dei
visitatori. Le installazioni, delle panchine opportunamente sagomate
e ridecorate per rappresentare il parlamento o un consiglio di
amministrazioni ecc, saranno disseminate per la città di Torino e
rivolte a uomini (spazi da quattro posti) e donne (spazi da un
posto).

Delle
semplici panchine, così come avvenne nel periodo dell'apartheid,
possono suggerire in concreto le
diverse opportunità (tra uomini e donne, così come un tempo tra
bianchi e neri) di reale partecipazione  e
""occupazione” di posti.

Cittadini
e cittadine saranno invitati a sedersi e ad esprimere opinioni e
valutazioni; le installazioni si riverberanno anche su internet, dove
un blog raccoglierà le foto e i  commenti. Sul luogo
dell'installazione saranno anche forniti alcuni dati di contesto
relativi ai tassi di occupazione femminile, rappresentanza politica
ecc.
Le
stesse panchine saranno a disposizione per attività di animazione,
spettacoli, presentazioni di libri e saranno dunque aperte alla creatività
di tutti e tutte.

L'attività
è in collaborazione con la Città di Torino ma abbiamo ancora forte
bisogno di un supporto economico per rendere l'operazione di vero
impatto e forza comunicativa!

The storks do not only mark the passage of time - for example, the arrival of the fall, but are also a symbol of steadiness, continuity and hope. They are expected to return to their nest every year and this impending return provides some sense of certainty and hope in ever changing conditions. This is a very powerful image.  </span></p>

<h3>Phono-Poetry</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.archiveofthenow.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Archive of the Now"">Archive of the Now</a> is a growing collection of experimental poetry from the UK, with digital recordings.</p>
<p>But recorded poetry has a long history, and so we are taking three poets from the archive back in time - just over 100 years - to be recorded onto wax cylinder and played on phonographs.</p>
<p>Phonography may be old, but it allows for all kinds of interesting tricks such as recording two layers on the same cylinder, and live recording and playback.</p>
<p>We are bringing phonography and the digital Archive together at a live event on 30 August 2013 in Brighton, UK at the <a href=""http://www.nightingaletheatre.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Nightingale Theatre"">Nightingale Theatre</a>. 10 of a total of 50 tickets are available on the door if you would like to join us!</p>

All these poets have expertise in working with sound technology in the form and texture of their writing, so they are perfect for an experiment in phonography. </p>
<p>Our phonography expert is Aleksander Kolkowski whose archive <a href=""http://www.phonographies.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Phonographies"">Phonographies</a> includes many contemporary musicians and sound artists, all recorded on wax cylinder to haunting effect.</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Your contribution will enable us to buy blank cylinders, pay for phonograph recording sessions, pay the poets' train fares to Brighton, and hire a venue so that the poets can perform live alongside phonograph recordings. We have already received a generous donation of £500 from <a href=""http://www.qmul.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Queen Mary"">Queen Mary</a> (University of London) towards the costs of this event, and will also receive a small income from ticket sales which we will split with the venue.</p>
<p>We don't think that artists should perform for free, so we would like to pay the poets a small fee each to commission new work specially written for the phonograph, exploring the relationship between past, present and future vocal sounds. </p>
<p>Any money raised beyond our indiegogo target will be used to develop the Archive of the Now, to extend ways in which users can interact with and make use of the recordings. </p>
<p>Pledges are collected via the Barque Press paypal account and all money goes directly to Phono Poetry - these payments are not being used to support Barque Press. </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>In return for your support we will send you</p>
<p>- an MP3 recording of one (or all) of the poets being played back on wax cylinder (£3 to £8)</p>
<p>- a unique mini dictaphone tape recording plus a signed typescript of work by one of the poets (£20 - only 9 available)</p>
<p>- a wax cylinder recorded with one of the poets (£90 - only 6 available)</p>
<p>- some swarf from our recording session plus a fragment of original manuscript, in a presentation box (£250 - only 3 available)</p>

Our phonography expert is Aleksander Kolkowski whose archive Phonographies includes many contemporary musicians and sound artists, all recorded on wax cylinder to haunting effect.
What We Need 
Your contribution will enable us to buy blank cylinders, pay for phonograph recording sessions, pay the poets' train fares to Brighton, and hire a venue so that the poets can perform live alongside phonograph recordings. We have already received a generous donation of £500 from Queen Mary (University of London) towards the costs of this event, and will also receive a small income from ticket sales which we will split with the venue.
We don't think that artists should perform for free, so we would like to pay the poets a small fee each to commission new work specially written for the phonograph, exploring the relationship between past, present and future vocal sounds. 
Any money raised beyond our indiegogo target will be used to develop the Archive of the Now, to extend ways in which users can interact with and make use of the recordings. 
Pledges are collected via the Barque Press paypal account and all money goes directly to Phono Poetry - these payments are not being used to support Barque Press. 
Perks
In return for your support we will send you
- an MP3 recording of one (or all) of the poets being played back on wax cylinder (£3 to £8)
- a unique mini dictaphone tape recording plus a signed typescript of work by one of the poets (£20 - only 9 available)
- a wax cylinder recorded with one of the poets (£90 - only 6 available)
- some swarf from our recording session plus a fragment of original manuscript, in a presentation box (£250 - only 3 available)


Other Ways You Can Help

<p>I am a Canadian artist, currently living in Austria, where I am working on an installation called “Ancient Cinema.”  The installation will debut at the Donat (a decommissioned 9<sup>th</sup>-century Byzantine church) in Zadar, Croatia in June, 2012.  “Ancient Cinema” takes the form of a speculative archaeological find in which recently discovered Roman artifacts from Zadar turn out to be the remains of the world’s first motion picture projector. </p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND <br/></strong>Zadar was an important Roman province and trading post from the 1<sup>st</sup> century BC until the 4<sup>th</sup> century AD.  Numerous examples of monumental Roman architecture remain in the town, including the largest Roman Forum on the eastern side of the Adriatic, lofty Roman columns, and an aqueduct. Throughout the town there are numerous excavated sites, and shards of Roman culture still litter the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>The most common Roman artifacts are fragments of pots, lamps, armor and the occasional coin; they are so commonplace, they are of no great value.  Occasionally, archaeologists stumble upon objects that are a bit more mysterious.  Take, for instance, the Antikythera mechanism, which was recovered from a shipwreck in 1901, but only recently analyzed.  Is it an ancient computer or an astronomical clock, or did it serve some other function? Archeologists are divided, and the mystery remains unsolved. </p>

<p>Yet another archaeological mystery was recently discovered at a flea market in Zadar:  oxidized piece of metal, a cache of hand-painted glass tablets (mostly shattered), a clay lamp, and an unusual coin with the Latin inscriptions “Sol Indiges” and “Inventori Lvcis”.    These artifacts form the basis of the installation “Ancient Cinema,” a meta-historical reflection on archaeology and storytelling.</p>
<p><img alt=""Coins"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4858648/coin_banner.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Coins""/></p>
<p>Are these archaeological artifacts discrete or related?  The coin, whose inscriptions reference ancient Roman sun worship, contains an image of the sun surrounded by rectangular shapes, not unlike the circular configuration of stones at Stonehenge.  Fragments of the clay lamp contain the same image.  Are the rectangular shapes a reference to the rectangular glass tablets? Are the images on the glass tablets identical or sequential?  Did they revolve around a central light source? </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT<br/></strong>Based on this speculative evidence, “Ancient Cinema” will present a working recreation of an ancient Roman movie projector, projecting the world’s first animated “films”.   Along with this groundbreaking discovery, the installation will feature a short documentary about the sourcing and analysis of the artifacts, a comprehensive Website examining the precedents for the Roman projector and other proto-cinematic innovations in the ancient world, and the evidence itself: the original artifacts “discovered” in the flea market.

<p>Using Venice as a model from which to think about other globalized territories, <strong>FAR FESTA</strong> asks: <strong>If the stability of the Venetian Republic was sustained by its civic rituals then, at times of societal instability, can contemporary rituals instill anew a sense of social cohesiveness and inaugurate novel ways of making community?

<p>Feeding from the city’s cultural memory while fostering its inhabitant’s civic agency in the face of mounting cultural and ecological threats to its survival, <strong>CORTEO DE CASTEO</strong><strong> </strong>seeks to build bridges between all Venetians, permanent and temporary residents, and artists, local and international, in Castello home to one of the most prominent international art events in the world and to one of the few remaining local communities in Venice.</p>
<p><strong>CORTEO DE CASTEO</strong><strong> will feature up to a dozen Italian artists based in Venice, Italy and abroad</strong>, born between the early 1960s and the late 1980s, many of whom have studied and taught at <strong>Università IUAV di Venezia</strong> and were or are artists-in-residence at <strong>Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa</strong>, the city’s only artistic residency program devoted to the Triveneto region.</p>
<p>Artists and artistic collectives invited to participate in <strong>CORTEO DE CASTEO </strong>include <strong>Riccardo Banfi</strong>, <strong>Bruna Esposito</strong>, <strong>Marta Grasso</strong>, <strong>IOCOSE</strong>, <strong>Elena Mazzi,</strong> <strong>Maria Morganti</strong><strong>, Claudia Rossini,</strong> <strong>Chiara Trivelli</strong>, <strong>Emilio Vavarella</strong> and <strong>Viaindustriae</strong>.</p>
