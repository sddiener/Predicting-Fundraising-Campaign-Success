</p><p>Neet Neilson is a Breast Cancer
Survivor. She has made it her mission in life to promote breast cancer awareness
by any means possible.  Having always been a Kylie fan, who also went
through breast cancer treatments at the same time her, Neet was inspired by her
music as she exercised through treatments. Exercise helped Neet feel normal and
immensely better.  Research shows that exercise is good for you before,
during and after breast cancer but this message is not being embraced by patients.
Neet feels passionately about this subject, so much so that she wrote a musical
using the music of Kylie to share a motivational, feel good story to inspire
people to exercise through their treatments, promote breast awareness and raise
funds for the 3 cancer charities close to her heart.  There will be 5
performances between the 24-26th October 2014 to coincide with Breast Cancer
Awareness Month, staged at the Mitchell Theatre, Glasgow, UK.</p>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><p><b>Your Disco Needs You - The Musical </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>i</b>s set around the struggles of ordinary people united in a
mission to save a local dance studio hit by recession.  The main characters come to the dance class
to escape their own personal dilemmas but find their problems being resolved
through new friends and relationships made at the class. The audience is brought into the story as each of the character’s
drama unfolds; triggering the viewer’s emotions along in tandem with the
characters experiences. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p><p><b>Your Disco Needs You - The
Musical </b> will make you laugh, cry, and laugh
again while the characters triumph over their issues as they work together to
establish new found confidences, hold on to self-respect, and find love with
the help of their family and fellow dancers to achieve their united mission.
Although the script touches on such sober subjects such as relationship
problems and cancer, the musical is delightfully witty, honest, and
uplifting. This musical gives you everything you would ask for in musical
theatre. Expect comedy, romance and sadness, with a feel good ending. It will
put a smile on your face and leave you genuinely satisfied and wanting more.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The story is told through the songs
of Kylie Minogue which makes it a must see for all fans. Even those who haven’t
succumbed to the charms of Kylie’s music (yet) will be entertained, moved and
unable to resist singing and tapping along. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Expect

This means we can give all the profit from ticket sales to 3 cancer charities. </p></div><p><b>What we need to raise:</b></p><p>
To ensure <b>Your Disco Needs You - The Musical </b> is the success
it is envisaged to be, we need to hire the theatre, enlist a choreographer,
musical director and director as well as hire rehearsal space, none of which
come for free. We also need to fund programme printing, leaflet printing, main
actors, audio visual requirements, costumes and props, all of which cost money.
We estimate it will cost £28,000 to stage 5 performances and rehearse for 3
months. We hope the ticket sales will generate approximately £40,000 which we
would divide amongst the 3 cancer charities. Half will be equally shared
between the 2 big charities Macmillan Cancer and Breakthrough Breast Cancer. The
other half will go to MBrace - a 12 week exercise programme designed
specifically for breast cancer patients which operates within the Greater Glasgow
and Clyde Health Board. The programme is run entirely from donations and is
in desperate need of funding to continue; it is a popular
programme and already has a waiting list of patients.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p>
</p><p>Our dream is that by showcasing this
musical, professional producers will want to stage it elsewhere on the
condition that they donate a generous portion of the profits to cancer
charities. The more we can raise, the more professional a performance we can
stage and the bigger the opportunity for professional producers wanting it for
bigger theatres.  Broadway, Movie – who knows? You can always say you were

<p>Hi Everybody!</p>
<p>My name is Omer Lavie, I am a 17-year-old dancer, a proud gay, originally from the north of Israel.</p>
<p>When I was 14, I fell in love with theatre dance, and started working very hard in order to succeed in this world, which I found enchanting. My passion and devotion to dance have led me to Thelma Yellin High School of the Art, which I was good enough to be accepted to.</p>
<p>And so, at the age of 15, I found myself leave my home, family and friends in northern Israel to a rented apartment next to Tel Aviv – just like a mature student.</p>
<p>Upon arriving to my new school, I met Shaked, a most charming person, who helped me to be absorbed in my new surroundings. Shaked is a year and a half older than me, and just like me, he is a dancer who left his home to a rented apartment near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>As time went by, we both fell deeply in love, and our relationship started blossoming. We both are extremely grateful for having each other's love, which grew stronger and stronger in the recent year.</p>
<p>We have learned together, danced together, and as time went by – we moved in together. Living together only strengthened our relationship and love. We are everything for each other.</p>
<p>Approximately six months ago, Shaked got a scholarship to study at The Academy Ballet of Washington, a once in a lifetime opportunity. Four months ago he left to DC, yet we never gave up our love, and although all the difficulties there are in a long distance relationship, we know we can make through all of them. There is nothing that can defeat our unbreakable love.</p>
<p>I miss my boyfriend a lot, and really want to visit him in Washington. Unfortunately, the expensive tuition fee and rent is a heavy burden on my parents, and they can't help me with financing a flight ticket (approximately $1,700). As I study every day from 8am to 9pm, I can't find any time to work, in order to save the needed money. Shaked doesn't have a working visa, so he also can't work.</p>
<p>Of course, our love is strong enough, even if we will see each other only in one year. But please, help us making this precious dream come true, help us raise the money for a flight ticket, so we could meet each other this year, even if it's for a short period. Please help us ease, even slightly, on our longings.</p>
<p>We shall never forget you, and will always be thankful for your kindness.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely, Omer</p>

<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">At the age of fifteen, I was out of school due to severe mental health problems, and with a lot of time on my hands and a lot of teenage angst in my heart, I decided to write a Catcher-in-the-Rye-style story about what happens to people who get lost in the school system.  A few months later, I had written Winter of Our Discotheque, a play which has since been described as ""St Trinians crossed with Lord of the Flies"". </span><br/>
</h3>
<div>Putting on a play when you're fifteen is very difficult, so while I kept on trying, unreliable teenage actors and lack of funds kept letting me down.</div>
<div>Then, years later at university, I met the redoubtable Laura, and we decided that with her as producer and me as director, we could put the play on a professional stage, and Tambourgi Productions was born.</div>
<div>After a small but well-received run, we are now taking this same play up to the Edinburgh Fringe 2014!  Winter of Our Discotheque explores the fringes of teenage society, and the isolation of mental illness in children, and asks what we can do to help troubled friends when our best intentions just aren't enough.</div>
<div>The actors are cast, the theatre is booked, the poster is designed, and we have been running fundraisers all year.  As a group aged between 19-22, we have very little money to back this ourselves, but we are working tirelessly to make this happen, for the great difference it could make in our careers and to get our best work out there for hundreds of people to see.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b>Where is the money going?</b></span></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Of course, the ultimate goal of our campaign is to stage a piece of work that we love, and we think you will too!  Here's what your contributions will be going towards...</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div><ul>
<li>£2100 for the hire of the theatre (this is actually a very good deal for Edinburgh!)</li>
<li>£200 to build a set, complete with beds and costumes</li>
<li>£100 for transport of set from York to Edinburgh</li>
<li>£195 for 10,000 flyers so we can pull in as many crowds as possible</li>
</ul></div><div>
<p></p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","The Idea

At the age of fifteen, I was out of school due to severe mental health problems, and with a lot of time on my hands and a lot of teenage angst in my heart, I decided to write a Catcher-in-the-Rye-style story about what happens to people who get lost in the school system.  A few months later, I had written Winter of Our Discotheque, a play which has since been described as ""St Trinians crossed with Lord of the Flies"". 

Putting on a play when you're fifteen is very difficult, so while I kept on trying, unreliable teenage actors and lack of funds kept letting me down.
Then, years later at university, I met the redoubtable Laura, and we decided that with her as producer and me as director, we could put the play on a professional stage, and Tambourgi Productions was born.
After a small but well-received run, we are now taking this same play up to the Edinburgh Fringe 2014!  Winter of Our Discotheque explores the fringes of teenage society, and the isolation of mental illness in children, and asks what we can do to help troubled friends when our best intentions just aren't enough.
The actors are cast, the theatre is booked, the poster is designed, and we have been running fundraisers all year.  As a group aged between 19-22, we have very little money to back this ourselves, but we are working tirelessly to make this happen, for the great difference it could make in our careers and to get our best work out there for hundreds of people to see.
Where is the money going?

Of course, the ultimate goal of our campaign is to stage a piece of work that we love, and we think you will too!  Here's what your contributions will be going towards...


£2100 for the hire of the theatre (this is actually a very good deal for Edinburgh!)
£200 to build a set, complete with beds and costumes
£100 for transport of set from York to Edinburgh
£195 for 10,000 flyers so we can pull in as many crowds as possible

<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Perlizbeth De Leon and I am a choreographer and artist based out of Atlanta, GA. My style is a unique fusion of hip hop, contemporary, jazz, popping, house, and waacking. I am slowly finding my own community of dancers here in Atlanta.</p>
<p>(In terms of COVID-19, we will be properly masked during rehearsals and during filming. At no point in time, except to consume water and food, will we remove our masks.)</p>
<p>This project: ""Us"" uses the song ""Us"" by Ruby Ibarra, Rocky Rivera, Klassy, and Faith Santilla in it's entirety, creating something akin to a music video. This video concept seeks to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empower mga pinay everywhere.</li>
<li>Inspire people to seek their own culture and roots.</li>
<li>Cultivate the pinay dance community in Atlanta, GA.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Budgeting Needs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compensation for eight dancers for their talent and hard work.</li>
<li>Studio rental for rehearsals for the entire month of October.</li>
<li>Costuming for four different shots and three different styles of dance: contemporary, hip hop, and heels.</li>
<li>Compensation for videographer, production, and editing team.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Donor Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inside look into creative process and rehearsals. You get to see exactly what you're funding and actual progress of the video project.</li>
<li>Access to behind the scenes footage of interviews, teasers, snippets of footage.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, I will be cutting some shots and costuming and paying dancers slightly less for their time.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I tried my hardest to find every female Filipino dancer in Atlanta and came up with nine dancers, including myself. </p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivating a presence for mga Pinay and the community around us.</li>
<li>Creating cultural awareness for those who may not know about Filipino culture.</li>
<li>Giving Pinay dancers a voice to express.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div><p> </p></div>","My name is Perlizbeth De Leon and I am a choreographer and artist based out of Atlanta, GA. My style is a unique fusion of hip hop, contemporary, jazz, popping, house, and waacking. I am slowly finding my own community of dancers here in Atlanta.
(In terms of COVID-19, we will be properly masked during rehearsals and during filming. At no point in time, except to consume water and food, will we remove our masks.)
This project: ""Us"" uses the song ""Us"" by Ruby Ibarra, Rocky Rivera, Klassy, and Faith Santilla in it's entirety, creating something akin to a music video. This video concept seeks to do the following:

Empower mga pinay everywhere.
Inspire people to seek their own culture and roots.
Cultivate the pinay dance community in Atlanta, GA.


Budgeting Needs

Compensation for eight dancers for their talent and hard work.
Studio rental for rehearsals for the entire month of October.
Costuming for four different shots and three different styles of dance: contemporary, hip hop, and heels.
Compensation for videographer, production, and editing team.

Donor Benefits

Inside look into creative process and rehearsals. You get to see exactly what you're funding and actual progress of the video project.
Access to behind the scenes footage of interviews, teasers, snippets of footage.
If we don't reach our goal, I will be cutting some shots and costuming and paying dancers slightly less for their time.


The Impact
I tried my hardest to find every female Filipino dancer in Atlanta and came up with nine dancers, including myself. 

Cultivating a presence for mga Pinay and the community around us.
Creating cultural awareness for those who may not know about Filipino culture.
Giving Pinay dancers a voice to express.

The most popular is a version rooted in patriarchy, where women are depicted as virtuous and pure with everlasting devotion for their husbands.

Hello, my name is Julie Rosier. Almost seven years ago I had a vision of how to bind together my burning passions for theater and social change.  In that moment, even before it had a name, Red Thread Theater was born.  According to Chinese legend, an invisible red thread connects all human beings together. It is said that though this magical cord may stretch or tangle it will never break.  

Here's how this unique theater-making process works: I assemble a small cast of Performer-Writers.  Then, working together as an ensemble, each individual mines through personal experience in search of a story that confronts and transcends a central point of internal conflict.  Finally, we weave these stories into a transformative multi-plot narrative, giving the audience an intimate and interconnected look at the fabric of individual and collective change.  

After an enthusiastic response to our inaugural production in Detroit, Red Thread Theater is very excited to introduce a new ensemble and a New York City premiere coming on June 3, 2011 to The Spoon Theater (38 W 38th Street, NYC). Since January, the NYC ensemble has gathered around the fertile soil of creation and recently five courageous stories came shooting out of the ground just in time for spring.  But we still need your support to ensure that this production is in glorious bloom by early summer.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"">My daughter, Sarvani Eloheimo, was born at International
Mission of Hope, an orphanage in Kolkata, India.<span style="""">  </span>She was 3-months-old when she came home to me in Olympia,
Washington. She is now 14.<span style=""""> </span>Fate
would have it that Olympia is also the home of Dr. Ratna Roy, Master Artist in
the female tradition of Odissi, one of the classical dance forms of India. Remarkably, Odissi originated less than three hundred miles from where Sarvani
was born! At the age of 5, here on the other side of the world, Sarvani began studying with Dr. Roy, known as the foremost proponent of this lineage in the world! Sarvani's first
performance, a solo, took place at the age of 8. Since then, Sarvani has
performed widely throughout the Puget Sound Region of Washington as well
as at the Third International Odissi Festival in Bhubaneswar, India when she
was 10. Notably, she and Dr. Roy have together received four Washington State Arts
Commission Master-Apprentice Awards between the ages of 9 and 14.<span style="""">  </span>Now, Dr. Roy has invited Sarvani to
perform with her company, Urvasi Dance Ensemble, in two international festivals
and one national festival in Bhubaneswar in December 2011. We are seeking help with travel expenses for this wonderful opportunity.  </span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"">In order for Sarvani’s training with Dr. Roy to continue,
along with performances in India, Sarvani will need new financial support. This
is due to the fact that, after receiving the Washington State Master-Apprentice
Awards four times (which is rare in itself), the likelihood of additional
awards, at least in the near future, is very slim.<span style="""">  </span>Additionally, the ability for Sarvani to perform in India
depends upon her ability to travel <i style="""">to</i>
India. The Master-Apprentice Award does not support such travel.<span style="""">  </span></span><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"">Realizing now that Sarvani’s long-term commitment to study,
practice and performance – and the support that I, as a single mother, am able to provide her – will
simply not be enough, I am reaching out in hopes that we may be able to find support for this opportunity, and perhaps beyond.<span style="""">  </span></span></p>

group dance took place in the summer of 2010 when Sarvani was 12.  It
was part of the Seattle Theater Group's ""Dance This!""
presented at Seattle's Paramount Theater.  This variation on a
traditional dance features Sarvani as a young girl ""waking"" into a
dream (she begins lying down on the far right) where she sees the
temple sculptures, from which much of the dance form has been
reconstructed, coming to life. <br/></span></span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;""><span style="""">What do we need at this time? Specifically,
we need assistance with costs involved in a three-week trip to
India in December 2011.  So far, being a part-time college teacher, I have
drawn upon family and community support in various ways:  I have
held garage/estate sales (offering belongings from Sarvani's
grandfather who had Alzheimer's and lived with us for six years until he
passed last year); I have held Zumba benefits (as a Zumba
instructor myself); and I have produced an evening of community music,
food, and silent auction.  While these events have raised nearly $2500
- along with lots of moral support! - they have reached
one-third of the overall travel costs. The costs are so high because
this includes myself and  Sarvani's 11-year-old sister, Meena, who
came home from Mumbai at the age of 5 and will, on this trip, be returning to India
for the very first time!  In this campaign, however, we are only seeking specific help with Sarvani's own international ticket that will cost nearly $1900 ($1870 to be precise).<br/></span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;""><span style=""""></span></span></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
My daughter, Sarvani Eloheimo, was born at International
Mission of Hope, an orphanage in Kolkata, India.  She was 3-months-old when she came home to me in Olympia,
Washington. She is now 14. Fate
would have it that Olympia is also the home of Dr. Ratna Roy, Master Artist in
the female tradition of Odissi, one of the classical dance forms of India. Remarkably, Odissi originated less than three hundred miles from where Sarvani
was born! At the age of 5, here on the other side of the world, Sarvani began studying with Dr. Roy, known as the foremost proponent of this lineage in the world! Sarvani's first
performance, a solo, took place at the age of 8. Since then, Sarvani has
performed widely throughout the Puget Sound Region of Washington as well
as at the Third International Odissi Festival in Bhubaneswar, India when she
was 10. Notably, she and Dr. Roy have together received four Washington State Arts
Commission Master-Apprentice Awards between the ages of 9 and 14.  Now, Dr. Roy has invited Sarvani to
perform with her company, Urvasi Dance Ensemble, in two international festivals
and one national festival in Bhubaneswar in December 2011. We are seeking help with travel expenses for this wonderful opportunity.  




The Impact


 
In order for Sarvani’s training with Dr. Roy to continue,
along with performances in India, Sarvani will need new financial support. This
is due to the fact that, after receiving the Washington State Master-Apprentice
Awards four times (which is rare in itself), the likelihood of additional
awards, at least in the near future, is very slim.  Additionally, the ability for Sarvani to perform in India
depends upon her ability to travel to
India. The Master-Apprentice Award does not support such travel.  Realizing now that Sarvani’s long-term commitment to study,
practice and performance – and the support that I, as a single mother, am able to provide her – will
simply not be enough, I am reaching out in hopes that we may be able to find support for this opportunity, and perhaps beyond.  

You can see Sarvani performing in the following YouTube videos:



http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nbrkX1yxO0
This is an acting dance about Krishna as a young child.  In it, Sarvani dances multiple parts including young mischievous Krishna, his mother, and Krishna's playmates.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZce0JmPXFc

This
group dance took place in the summer of 2010 when Sarvani was 12.  It
was part of the Seattle Theater Group's ""Dance This!""
presented at Seattle's Paramount Theater.  This variation on a
traditional dance features Sarvani as a young girl ""waking"" into a
dream (she begins lying down on the far right) where she sees the
temple sculptures, from which much of the dance form has been
reconstructed, coming to life. 







What We Need & What You Get
What do we need at this time? Specifically,
we need assistance with costs involved in a three-week trip to
India in December 2011.  So far, being a part-time college teacher, I have
drawn upon family and community support in various ways:  I have
held garage/estate sales (offering belongings from Sarvani's
grandfather who had Alzheimer's and lived with us for six years until he
passed last year); I have held Zumba benefits (as a Zumba
instructor myself); and I have produced an evening of community music,
food, and silent auction.  While these events have raised nearly $2500
- along with lots of moral support! - they have reached
one-third of the overall travel costs. The costs are so high because
this includes myself and  Sarvani's 11-year-old sister, Meena, who
came home from Mumbai at the age of 5 and will, on this trip, be returning to India
for the very first time!  In this campaign, however, we are only seeking specific help with Sarvani's own international ticket that will cost nearly $1900 ($1870 to be precise).

What will you receive? During the trip, to the extent possible, we wish to share our experiences with all of Sarvani's supporters by maintaining a blog.  Back home, I plan to produce a performance of Odissi dance that includes some of the dances performed at the festivals in India.  All local contributors of $10 or more (past and future) will receive a complimentary ticket to the performance. All contributors of $20 or more, near or far, will also receive a signed photograph of Sarvani performing.  Beyond that, I hope all will feel the rich satisfaction of knowing they are supporting a young talent as she transitions through her teen years as well as of knowing they are helping her share with others the joy her dancing can bring.  

A most sincere ""thank you.""

 sent away to a School for Arktoi (unruly children) in the wake of great

<p>This exciting World Premiere production of <em>Us &amp; Everything We Own </em>will appear on stage at Vancouver's PAL Studio Theatre, 581 Cardero Street, from April 5-13, 2013 (Preview performance on April 4 for $12!)</p>

<p>NY Times says '<span>A big cat is actually on the prowl in “Tigers Be Still,” an endearing new play by Kim Rosenstock, but nobody’s paying much attention to this alarming problem.

The possibility of being eaten by a wild animal might be greeted with indifference, if not actually welcomed, by the benumbed, bewildered and bedridden characters in this quirk-addicted but heartfelt comedy.'</span></p>

<h3>Parallel Universe Theater Resources is premiering its large ensemble decadently spiritual verse play FREEFALL FROSTBITE at the historic Ellen Stewart Theater as part of the New York Fringe Festival in August, 2013.</h3>
<p>Written by Michael Fixel (Salamander Stew, Fringe 2011), scored by Fixel and Broadway veteran musical director Marc Irwin, assistant musical director and piano conductor Adele Dinerstein, and directed and choreographed by Juliet Fixel, it is Shakespeare as if he had hung out with William S. Burroughs.  It has songs, but it's sure not Lerner and Lowe.</p>
<p>The mission of  Parallel Universe is to provide meaningful artistic opportunities for early career performers.  That's part of the reason we favor large-cast productions- that and the fact that we just love specatcle.  We are really looking forward to whirlpooling around the vast mystical space of the Ellen Stewart Theater on 4th Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side.</p>
<p>Large ensemble means relatively high costs.  We believe in featuring the skills of the performers over scenery and effects, and that keeps production costs low, but we still wind up spending plenty on big rehearsal halls, costumes, incidentals like programs, and invisibles like insurance.</p>
<p>We feel really privileged to have been selected by Fringe.  Only one of five applicants makes it to the stage.  Fringe does an excellent job of making it possible to produce a show in New York at moderate cost.  It's still New York, though.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise about $300 for each of the thirty-three or so members of the troupe (it's hard to tell exactly how many- they keep moving).  Even if we are successful in this drive, we still have to sell alot of tickets, so please help spread the word. </p>
<p>You can hear some of the score and read an excerpt from the play on our website. </p>
<p>Juliet Fixel's realization of the prequel at Fringe in 2011, earned accolades such as this from nytheater.com:</p>
<p>""Salamander Stew is a refreshingly unique experience with a confident sense of itself, performed virtuosically by a talented and committed ensemble.""</p>
<p>Freefall Frostbite is, if anything, a much more ambitious play.  Perhaps an important play.  Where it will go from here is anybody's guess.  With your help though it will have already succeeded in its most important goal, that of providing a significant opportunity to these dedicated young actors and techs and gifting them with an experience they will remember the rest of their lives and be proud to have on their resumes.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">“A Map of the Ocean’s Floor” (formerly known as ""A Jazz Sweet for Poets"") is a new play by Jessica Lewis. Based in New York City in the late 1970s, at the end of the bohemia that had been created in the previous years by the Beat Generation. The play, set at the end of a social and artistic era discusses themes of disillusionment and the changing times, and how that was affecting the practices of musicians, writers, and artists, who had been involved with, or inspired by the Beat Generation. The play itself uses the multi-disciplinary approach of the Beat Generation by combining music, theater, spoken word, and movement to create a new work of theater that is experimental, while remaining heavily grounded in the traditions of realism, naturalism, and the collaborative works that came out of the Beat Generation itself. “A Map of the Ocean’s Floor” for Poets pays homage to the Beat Generation, while depicting the end of an era.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Jessica Lewis, writes a play heavily influenced by the music and poetry of the Beat Generation, by combining all of these genres to create a work that attempts to defy classical genres of theater. By combining jazz music, spoken word poetry, live theater, history, and dance, she tells the story of a young girl who looses her sense of ""reality,"" while getting swept up in the romanticism and nostalgia of the end of Bohemia as it had previously been known.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Through this play we see how the music and words of the Beat Generation moved and inspired so many around it, but also how it enabled a whole generation after to get lost in a world of excess and unrealistic views of what it meant to be an artist.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A love of the music and the language of poetry, as an expression of what jazz musicians were doing with their music at the time was what the Beat Generation was attempting to do. “A Map of the Ocean’s Floor”, we see how those ideas and objectives got easily misconstrued by many who were in search of something ""real,"" and of a ""real artists life,"" and how this distance from reality has impacted youth from all generations since.</p>

<h3>The campaign: </h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Hi!! My name is Alysha Higgins and I am a U.S. Fulbright scholar, studying and documenting dance of the Indian and African diaspora in the culturally rich and diverse Trinidad and Tobago. My work is to promote mutual understanding between international borders and create cultural exchange. I am organizing, in collaboration with the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) to bring Rosangela Silvestre of Brazil, creator of the world-renowned Silvestre Technique, to Trinidad and Tobago to teach a four-day, intensive Silvestre Technique and Orixa dance movement workshop culminating in a performance of her ongoing choreographic work, Faces of Nature. The proposed dates of her stay are October 23rd to the 28th, 2013. The proposed workshops would be open to the public. The workshop and performance is proposed to take place at UTT’s dance room at the National Academy of Performing Arts (NAPA). The performance will take place at The Little Carib Theatre.</p>
<h3>The Impact: </h3>
<p>I have been a student of Rosangela for the past year and truly believe in her work. She is an amazing, inspiring artist and teacher. Rosangela's work is a strong force in the cultural arts and international dance world, while at the same time, Trinidad is becoming a leader in the Caribbean dance community- with a legacy of dance icons like Beryl McBurnie and Pearl Primus, as well as a contemporary dance community of present including the Coco Dance Festival and the New Waves Institute that is skyrocketing Trinidad into the global dance arena. Because of this, I believe bringing Rosangela to Trinidad is a great opportunity to spark international ties and strengthen Trinidad’s role as a Caribbean mecca for contemporary and world dance. The Silvestre Technique, which is a fusion of modern techniques with energetic principles of the natural world, along with the dance expression of Orixa, is complementary to the strong Modern, African, and Indian dance cultures of Trinidad. Experiencing Orixa movement from the African diaspora in Brazil would be a one-of-a-kind experience for participants, providing them with a comparison to the Orisha religion practiced in Trinidad and studied by students in the country, and allowing them to expand their scope of what dance of the African diaspora means on a global scale. I guarantee that what Rosangela will offer the people of Trinidad will greatly inspire, enrich, and enhance their experience as dancers, artists, and people. </p>
<p>The workshop will be a true exchange because there will be Orisha dance movement classes given by Trinidad and Tobago natives as well, as well as performances by Trinidad and Tobagonians, highlighting their specific Orisha dance and dance expressions. I believe that this building of ties in the international community is extremely powerful and healing for African diasporic communities in TnT!! </p>
<h3>The money will go towards:</h3>
<p>1) Rosangela's round-trip plane ticket along with one drummer</p>
<p>2) Renting of the space of the Little Carib Theatre for the culminating performace</p>

<h3>AOJ: Fact or Fiction </h3>
<p>A show 6 years in the making-literally!   Very dear to our hearts, and based off a true story, comes a show that gives you an inside look at the cut-throat mentality of the Los Angeles Theatre Scene.  As the play opens, Scott and Sam are having a grand old time, when Scott announces that he is starting a theatre company.  The wild success of his first two-shows lead him down a dark path.   The prideful always tend to fall.  In a real coming-of-age story off true life, Scott must confess and deal with  Sexual addiction, backstabbing and deceit, and even enter hibernation to one-day re-emerge on top. Does he succeed?   Only time will tell. The facts presented in the story are undisputed, the controversy this is sure to to spark some among some and hot debates and topics with others.  The show is different every-time you see it as Audience suggestion will dictate how each scene of facts is presented through an improv-style format, intertwined with Dialogue of Facts.   </p>

<p></p>
<p>3... 2.. 1. ON FIRE! is our signature, bread and butter event. A high energy, high-octane hybrid Improv and Burlesque extravaganza.   Our female and male burlesque dancers are ready to spark your imagination and desires, while our improv troupe is ready to ignite your laughter.  Who ever dreamed that these two will play out in such a way that they will always go together as peanut butter and jelly? We did; and you would not believe how good it tastes!   This particular version of 3... 2.. 1. ON FIRE while be 30-45 minutes, and is meant to give you a taste of our full length shows, which is our signature show for the collective, performing every 2nd and 4th Friday at TU Studios in North Hollywood..  </p>

AOJ: Fact or Fiction 
A show 6 years in the making-literally!   Very dear to our hearts, and based off a true story, comes a show that gives you an inside look at the cut-throat mentality of the Los Angeles Theatre Scene.  As the play opens, Scott and Sam are having a grand old time, when Scott announces that he is starting a theatre company.  The wild success of his first two-shows lead him down a dark path.   The prideful always tend to fall.  In a real coming-of-age story off true life, Scott must confess and deal with  Sexual addiction, backstabbing and deceit, and even enter hibernation to one-day re-emerge on top. Does he succeed?   Only time will tell. The facts presented in the story are undisputed, the controversy this is sure to to spark some among some and hot debates and topics with others.  The show is different every-time you see it as Audience suggestion will dictate how each scene of facts is presented through an improv-style format, intertwined with Dialogue of Facts.   

3... 2.. 1. ON FIRE!

3... 2.. 1. ON FIRE! is our signature, bread and butter event. A high energy, high-octane hybrid Improv and Burlesque extravaganza.   Our female and male burlesque dancers are ready to spark your imagination and desires, while our improv troupe is ready to ignite your laughter.  Who ever dreamed that these two will play out in such a way that they will always go together as peanut butter and jelly? We did; and you would not believe how good it tastes!   This particular version of 3... 2.. 1. ON FIRE while be 30-45 minutes, and is meant to give you a taste of our full length shows, which is our signature show for the collective, performing every 2nd and 4th Friday at TU Studios in North Hollywood..  
What Your Love-Donation will Represent
We are hoping to raise $1500 in hopes that we can bring two projects we are very passionate about to the Hollywood Fringe, Here is where the money will be allocated:

$250 will be for our Fringe application fee.
$1200 will be going to our theatre rental for the Fringe Festival at our two locations: The Asylum & Studio-Stage.
$50 will go to a special event night we are hosting for all of our donors.





Can't Spread the Love Today?


Please know even just $1 will go a long way towards reaching our goal, we would be grateful for even that!  We know some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Now in it's 7th year BelTheatre now has over 80 members aged from 7 to 19 years of age. As part of our commitment to our young people's artistic, educational and personal development we have organised a visit for 11 of our young members to visit the Theatre Royal in Bath's Egg Youth theatre in order to spend time together with their members sharing their experiences, opinions and experiences through a series of creative workshops. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have been working very hard over the last three months to raise the money required for this exciting opportunity. Through a number of generous actions donations from a wide range of people we have raised to date almost 3000 pounds towards the 3500 pounds required to make this trip a reality.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, until our departure on the 23rd of May, we will be doing everything we can to raise the final 500 pounds and this is where any help you can offer would be gratefully appreciated.</p>
<p>The money raised will go straight to paying for our accommodation in Bath, which in itself totals over 1800 pounds. If we are lucky enough exceed our goal we will put the money towards arranging another excursion or two for the group while they are in the UK.  <br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>For young people living anywhere in the world, one of the greatest opportunities they can be offered for learning and development is travel and the chance to meet and interact with people from other cultures.</p>
<p>For many different reasons many young people will never be given the opportunity to compare there own understandings of the world with others in a meaningful way, and we wish to change that for a handful of young people from Belgrade, Serbia.</p>
<p>This project is the fourth time that BelTheatre has organised such a trip (following trips to Croatia, Italy and the Czech Republic) and on each occasion we would not have been able to do so without the generosity and fundraising efforts of members and friends.</p>
<p>Organising a trip to the UK is extra complicated and expensive due to the fact that each young person must secure a visa, which in itself costs 90 pounds (with no guarantee of it being awarded). But we are determined that despite the financial and  bureaucratic challenges we will make this opportunity a reality.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The most challenging aspect of this project is undoubtedly the  bureaucracy involved with the visa system. Unlike all other European countries, the UK and Ireland still require people from Serbia to go through a humiliating and stressful procedure in order to enter the UK, even if these people are below the age of 18 and involved in a creative/educational programme.  <br/><br/>BelTheatre is a very active but relatively small organisation with only one full-time member of staff supported by 3 other dedicated part-timers. We are proud of our track record of opening up educational and creative opportunities to local young people and doing so without making the costs of such initiatives prohibitive.<br/><br/>We continue to do this because we see the benefit that such activities have on young people's lives (both our own members and those we visit).  <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Even if you cannot support this project financially, we would ask you to share this information to as wide a group of people as you can , because believe us when we tell you, every pound raised makes a huge difference to our efforts and will encourage us to continue our efforts both now and in the future.<br/>

<p>MATERIALIZE is a full puppet production having it's world premiere this August at the<a href=""http://www.marylandensemble.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Maryland Ensemble Theatre</a> in Frederick, MD.</p>
<p><b>Who are we? </b>We are a team of 14 artists putting together an 
original show that delves into our human need to figure out who we 
really are and understand the masks we wear to hide ourselves.
</p><p>This show originated in the need to create a theatre piece that 
responded to current social events in a universal way. Through 
conversations and collecting stories both personal and public, the piece
 has become an exploration on themes of invisibility, identity, 
dehumanization and objectification.  These collected stories will be 
adapted into a series of puppet scenes into a more simplified, visual 
language that speaks to universal human emotions and behaviors.</p>
<b>What's most exciting for us</b> is to see what audiences will take
 away from this show, viewers can project their own ​experience​ onto 
what's ​happen​ing onstage. Our hope is through these pieces, audiences 
will recognize their own hopes, fears, and ultimately see that the story
 unfolding onstage is their own.​<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FndkevVBpI3U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DndkevVBpI3U%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FndkevVBpI3U%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>

When the original run of the show finished last April, we knew that closing night could not mark its final performance. Anyone who saw it can attest: this piece needs to be performed again.

<h3>Future</h3>
<p>We are hoping that Capital Fringe and our other performances in the Northeast this summer will serve as stepping stones for further development and presentation of the piece. As the climate of our country changes, as well as our own experiences, grow and change, we find the need to continue to delve deeper into this material and develop these narratives that feel relevant today more than ever. We also aim to present this piece to different audiences in different cities across the country in hopes to develop a pointed yet accessible piece of theater.</p>

Every dollar donated will be stretched to the fullest to provide audiences with well produced, thoughtful, and evocative theater.
Your donation will go towards:


artist stipends to aid in the financial burden of touring

fees that are required for participating in Capital Fringe 2018

getting the word out there through our marketing campaign


costumes to clothe us, a set for us to play on, props for us to engage with, and lights so you can see our smiling faces

transportation for us and our production elements
a space to rehearse our show


Future
We are hoping that Capital Fringe and our other performances in the Northeast this summer will serve as stepping stones for further development and presentation of the piece. As the climate of our country changes, as well as our own experiences, grow and change, we find the need to continue to delve deeper into this material and develop these narratives that feel relevant today more than ever. We also aim to present this piece to different audiences in different cities across the country in hopes to develop a pointed yet accessible piece of theater.

<p>Each donation goes directly into the Funhouse III budget and is spit right back out at ya in the form of experimental live theatre. Your contribution allows the us to provide you, the audience, with a high-quality theatrical experience unlike any other, while also providing a safe environment for theatre artists from all backgrounds to experiment and dismantle traditional notions of what theatre can be.</p>
<p>The more money we raise, the higher quality costumes, makeup, sets, props, and overall experience we can provide. By supporting Funhouse, you are supporting art, artists, creativity, innovation, and iconoclasm. Also, you get a cool t-shirt!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Your Donation Goes:</h3>
<p><strong>Space</strong>: It costs a whole heck of a lot of money to rent out a theatre for a weekend, not to mention rehearsal space. That rehearsal space really adds up.<br/><strong>Stipends</strong>: Call us entitled millennials, but we think artists deserve to be paid for their work. <br/><strong>Costumes/Hair/Makeup</strong>: Our costume/hair/makeup designer is named Erika and she is an actual witch whose primary power is doing incredible things with limited resources, which means that if we're able to expand her resources HOLY MOLY IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES.<br/><strong>Sets/Props</strong>: We want this show to look good for you. You deserve a good-looking show. Let us give you that.<br/><strong>Future Funhouses</strong>: We operate on a non-profit business model, which means that all donations and ticket proceeds not used for Funhouse III will be used for Funhouse IV, V, VI, and BEYOND!! We have a lot of spreadsheets and graphs we can show you to illustrate Funhouse's upward trajectory throughout the first three shows, if you're interested. Let us know. We'll send you the documents.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We get it. Theatre is a dying art form. Why go see a live show when you could binge-watch the new season of Narcos from the comfort of your couch? BECAUSE LIFE IS ABOUT EXPERIENCES, THAT'S WHY. And because this isn't just some boring Edward Albee play (full disclosure: we love Edward Albee, but you get the point). We guarantee you're going to walk away from Funhouse feeling different. In a good way. Like when you tried schnapps for the first time. But without the puke. There actually might be some puke, but it will be on-stage. And it will be fake puke. You will not come into contact with any actual puke. Let's see Narcos make you feel like THAT.</p>

<p>First and foremost come to see <i>Great Kills </i>during its New York run (<a href=""https://tix.smarttix.com/Modules/Sales/SalesMainTabsPage.aspx?ControlState=1&amp;DiscountCode=&amp;SalesEventId=3836&amp;DC="" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tickets available here</a>).  That's the reason we're doing this in the first place, for our audience, and nothing would make us happier than to see you sitting out there!</p>
<p>Another way to help would be to tell all your friends about the show.  We're hoping to sell out as many dates as possible, so if you could spread the word that there's a chance to see the legendary Joey Pants in a small intimate theater for only $20, please don't hesitate to do so! <br/></p>
<p>Lastly, please share our indiegogo campaign to your friends, either through email or on social media (please like our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/greatkillstheplay"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">facebook page</a>).  We live in an age of the Viral sensation, and if you could help us spread the word about <i>Great Kills </i>and everything else we're trying to do at PRIME it would be an enormous boost!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p style="""">As Umberto Eco said: ""To survive, you must tell stories.""  Self-reflection is at the heart of our humanity.  It is how we remember the past, consider the present, and move toward the future.  The artist assumes this challenge for society, examining life, and presenting it for your entertainment.  The independent artist gives voice to personal and variant stories that might not otherwise be heard.  This is a burden that comes with great effort, and personal sacrifice.  Those involved in <i>Great Kills</i> will see no profit for their efforts, instead, they are motivated by passion, and find their satisfaction in telling this story.    </p>
<p style="""">This is why we founded PRIME Stage to Screen, and why we hope you'll find it necessary to support us in anyway you can.<br/></p>

Great Kills is an original play by
Tom Diriwachter running March 26th to April 12th, 2015 in New York City (tickets available here).  Reflecting the big-time aspirations of small-timers in Staten Island, this darkly comic play tells the tale of a get-rich-quick scheme gone awry, and has as its themes, family, addiction, mental health, and the dissolution of the working class.  
The production will be directed by Jonathan Weber and stars Joe Pantoliano, Peter
Welch, and Robert Homeyer.  It is
being produced by Obie Award and Pulitzer Prize winning Theater for the New City, and brought to you by PRIME Stage
to Screen- a newly formed theatrical company, whose mission is to bring new American plays to the stage, as well as high quality, independent screen adaptations of these plays to the screen soon after.  Bearing the play's theme of working class dissolution in mind, another major aspect of PRIME'S mission is to bring its productions to audiences for a price the working class can afford- something that is often missing in the American Theater today.


Why Support GREAT KILLS 

As Great Kills marks PRIME'S first production, it is essential we raise appropriate capital for its success.  We've already been successful at attracting the Emmy Award winning actor Joe Pantoliano (The Sopranos, Memento, The Matrix) to be in our very first production (no small feat even for a veteran theater company).  Now we need your support to meet the our maiden production's financial needs.  


 While we are grateful to Theater for the New City for producing Great Kills, there is still a significant expense, including set design, marketing, promotion, support staff, and artists' salaries, that falls to the production team.  Your contribution shows your appreciation, helps to lessen the burden, and assures that there will be more stories from PRIME Stage to Screen in the future.
Starting something from scratch is always the most challenging undertaking in the arts, but when launched successfully, it's also the most rewarding.  Your support will make you an integral part of this brand new undertaking, and will also make you part of something that you'll be able to look back on five or ten years from now and say ""I helped make that happen!""

for our Great Kills' funding campaign is extremely simple, and yet, extremely ambitious.  We seek to raise
$10,000 in 10 days, through contributions of $10, $100, and $1000.  Not only that, we are starting this campaign 10 days before our official opening date on March 28th (with previews on the 26th & 27th).  In other words this campaign will close on the very night we open!

However, if we don't reach our funding goal of $10,000, your contributions will still be an enormous help.  By taking at least some of the burden off our shoulders, your funds will free us to make this inaugural production the success we know it can be, and ensure a future for our company.  



    Other Ways YOU  Can Help Us



 We know not everyone can afford the $10 donation.  But please don't worry, as there are other ways you can help.  
First and foremost come to see Great Kills during its New York run (tickets available here).  That's the reason we're doing this in the first place, for our audience, and nothing would make us happier than to see you sitting out there!
Another way to help would be to tell all your friends about the show.  We're hoping to sell out as many dates as possible, so if you could spread the word that there's a chance to see the legendary Joey Pants in a small intimate theater for only $20, please don't hesitate to do so! 
Lastly, please share our indiegogo campaign to your friends, either through email or on social media (please like our facebook page).  We live in an age of the Viral sensation, and if you could help us spread the word about Great Kills and everything else we're trying to do at PRIME it would be an enormous boost!

As Umberto Eco said: ""To survive, you must tell stories.""  Self-reflection is at the heart of our humanity.  It is how we remember the past, consider the present, and move toward the future.  The artist assumes this challenge for society, examining life, and presenting it for your entertainment.  The independent artist gives voice to personal and variant stories that might not otherwise be heard.  This is a burden that comes with great effort, and personal sacrifice.  Those involved in Great Kills will see no profit for their efforts, instead, they are motivated by passion, and find their satisfaction in telling this story.    
This is why we founded PRIME Stage to Screen, and why we hope you'll find it necessary to support us in anyway you can.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<i>Fragments</i> is a play in development, written by Geraldine Inoa, about three African American mental patients in a psychiatric ward. Each character reveals the anguish and devastation that brought them to the hospital. The stories they share are<br/>desperate attempts to reclaim their existence and cope with their suffering. The characters question the value of psychiatric care and engage in discussions that provide insight into the lives of those who suffer from mental illness.<br/><br/>The play was first conceived as a one act in 2013, during Geraldine's studies at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study. Since then it has been produced as a full length play at the inaugural New Works festival at HUB-BUB in South Carolina. This reading marks a return to New York City for <i>Fragments</i> after the expansion of the piece.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>The goal of this campaign is to raise $500 for the reading. 40 to 50 percent of this goal will go directly towards the performance space of the reading.

<p>Hi. We're Goodly Rotten Apple Productions. Our production company aims to take the talents of all the different artists we know of all mediums and utilize their talents to create a work of art. As we are most familiar with the theatre, our first project is a play. We are thrilled to be reviving the play The Water Children by Wendy MacLeod in NYC this fall. While this play was written in 1997, it is very timely today as it deals with the hot button issue of abortion. We even have permission from the playwright to update the references and set it in 2012, so it will be even more relevant to anyone who comes to see it (like you?)! This is an important piece of theatre, and we need your help to get it up.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise $15,000 to cover the cost of costumes, lights, set, sound, advertising, cast and crew salaries and rehearsal and performance space for our 16 performance run in NYC. Currently, Mary is funding this show from her day job paycheck and she has covered a lot, but can't cover it all. The more money we raise, the better production values we can have and the more likely it will be that this important work can sell out and perhaps get extended for a longer run Off-Broadway. In order to be prepared to deal with this potential success, we need the funds to back it up. So we're turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're offering several perks at different levels of giving. Your contribution will help us create a brilliant production that can help remind people that art does indeed have the power to change the world and further to help support your local theatre artists here in NYC.

Our goal is to expand our various studies by attending Juste Debout, an international streetdance festival in Paris, France, from March 4 through March 10. This festival will help us in our future career paths and allow us to experience a multicultural event attended by dancers from all over the world. Melissa Britt, a Clinical Professor at ASU, is conducting research on the topic of Urban Movement on a global scale. Our experience at Juste Debout will help feed her research through looking at our experiences and interactions at the festival. Our trip to Juste Debout, besides acting as a means to conduct research, will also help enrich our individual growth as we transition from the University to the professional field. While attending Juste Debout we will be taking a series of classes and participating in the urban movement culture in France. Our goal is to gain an understanding of values and practices from urban movement communities all over the world and how they relate to our own communities. Our wish is to bring our newfound awareness and understanding back to not only ASU but the pre-existing movement culture in Arizona in order to enhance our developing movement community with this global experience.<br/><br/><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong><br/><br/>There are a lot of costs when traveling to a foreign country but your contributions will be put towards our class fees. It’s $500 for class registration and if we reach our goal, these funds would cover that cost.

These perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personalized postcard from France</li>

<p>You think you know the classic Dickens’ <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. But what if the story was set in SE Ohio and old Eb Scrooge owned the local mine? What if Bob Cratchit organized the mine workers, and Fezziwig’s holiday party took place at historic Stuart’s Opera House with local favorites Rattletrap Stringband playing live onstage?</p>
<p>Brick Monkey Theater Ensemble (BMTE), Southeast Ohio’s professional theater company, is proud to announce the world premiere of <em>An Appalachian Christmas Carol </em>and the inauguration of a local Holiday Tradition. The production of this new – and newly relevant to our region – adaptation of the Charles Dickens’ Christmas classic will run Thursday through Sunday, December 13 - 16, 2012 at Stuart’s Opera House in Nelsonville, Ohio.</p>
<p>This production is the culmination of two years of development and research that has included extensive input from community storytellers, historians, and musicians. Spinning the traditional ghost story and tale of redemption, <em>An Appalachian Christmas Carol</em> honors Southeast Ohio’s rich coal mining and labor union heritage, while simultaneously celebrating the spirit of the season.  This is a joyful story of redemption, rooted in rural storytelling and intertwined with regional traditional music.</p>
<p>BMTE is proud to be supported by the Ohio Arts Council, the Athens Foundation, the Athens County Convention and Visitors Bureau, the O’Bleness Foundation, the Bernard and Judy Cornwell Foundation, and Kleinpenny Rentals.</p>

<p>The Monkeys want to see the Nelsonville Public Square filled with visitors every Christmas. They’ll be coming to see the production of <em>An Appalachian Christmas Carol</em>, eating a Cratchit family Christmas dinner, buying gifts on the Square, staying in local hotels, ice skating at the North Pole Rink, riding the North Pole Express, connecting with groups like Little Cities of Black Diamonds, and telling their friends to visit Nelsonville for a family holiday event they can’t find anywhere else. But we need your help to make this vision a reality.</p>

Here is a nifty pie chart showing how our budget will be used to produce the new show.






We have a funding gap of $7K and your donation will support our production costs: theater rental, lighting designer, audio engineer, props, sets and costumes. We are a scrappy and resourceful organization and each dollar you donate will be stretched as far as possible to produce a great show!



Don’t forget to check out the great perks at the various donation levels; you can show your Tango 21 Dance Theater pride and immerse yourself in our tango community!




Help us spread the word! Share via word of mouth and social media about this campaign and the new show (see the links on this page to share)!

With your help, we will continue to make an impact on the world by sharing our original stories that connect diverse communities through the language of Argentine tango.


Your support is the wind beneath our wings.
Thank you!

For years I have been dealing with this illness, and had no idea. I never considered the idea of therapy, and it cost me. It cost me friendships, relationships, and opportunities. All around me, I see others like me. Others who show the same signs of turmoil and internal agony that plagued my life. I also see the people who shame them into avoiding the fact that they have a <strong>VERY TREATABLE ILLNESS.</strong></p>
<p>I know I can't fix this problem alone, but with your help we can definitely help many others to know that they don't have to suffer in silence and they can be helped. I have crafted the message. I need your help to spread it.</p>
<p>One amazing aspect of entertainment, is the power to help others overcome their personal struggles, by sharing the struggles of another. In my new show ""Wendell Tucker Hates the World"", I share my struggles, insights and weaknesses to be that example. The message is a simple one:<strong> Depression is not a White thing, or a Woman thing, or a show of weakness. It is an illness, it can be treated, and it can be overcome. </strong></p>
<p>My goal is to raise $25,000 for a National Tour of ""Wendell Tucker Hates the World"" and to film the accompanying DVD ""The Face of Depression"". We want to encourage others to share their story, and help bring to light how people from different backgrounds took control of their life. </p>
<p>To show my dedication to this very important endeavor, I am embarking on a 40 day fast beginning midnight, July 29, 2012 and ending midnight September 7, 2012. For these 40 days I will abstain from all solid and processed food, living only on water and 1 8oz glass of juice per day. My hope is to inspire others to sacrifice for the betterment of our communities, through my own sacrifice. I will be posting daily updates of my progress and my experiences during this time. I sincerely hope you will join the cause and help me shine a light on MDD.</p>

By raising funds we will be able to give the children and young dancers the chance to perform on stage at the amazing Pallas theatre, in the centre of Athens, on the 26<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup> of November 2016!</p>
<p>The main goal of ACB is to give the opportunity to talented young ballet dancers to perform in a professional ballet under the guidance of experienced teachers as well as to give them a life transforming experience! This year <strong>we are especially thankful and grateful that our choreographer is Erico Montes, </strong>the first ballet dancer of the Royal Ballet of London. Erico has created just for us an original choreography in a new ballet called “Persephone: The Secret of the Seasons”. In order to continue our goals we ask for your support! Furthermore your contribution will give the opportunity to the young dancers to attend a summer course abroad and to further blossom!</p>
<p>A few words about ACB:</p>
<p>The Athens Children’s Ballet is a non-profit organization founded in 2013 amid the difficulties of the Greek economy.  We were willing to take the risk, however, as we believe that Art has a healing power and is the noblest reaction in times of crisis.</p>
<p>We aspire to motivate our youngsters and encourage them to set high goals, to be creative and to enrich their artistic expression. The group was formed by auditioning 300 young dancers (9 to 22 years old), from all over Greece; those selected are rigorously trained and well-prepared by highly skilled professionals and are ready to participate in a classic repertoire ballet performance.</p>
<p>“Snow White” (2013), “Cinderella” (2014) and “Beauty and the Beast” (2015) are the three productions we have already created and which have been attended by more than 5.000 spectators.</p>

We've decided to take a risk unlike anything we've seen in Atlanta: produce five fully mounted productions in one year that are free to our audiences, and to keep scientific records of what we learn along the way.  It's like your high school science lab where you planted beans, if the beans were free plays, and you actually wrote stuff down in your composition notebook.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Each one of the Seedling Members has agreed to donate $100 towards each production (Which gives us $800 per show), but we expect each production to cost us between $1500 to $2000. We need to raise $5000 to fill in that gap so that we can offer free admission to shows that are worth seeing. The dollars you give go to venues, sets, costumes, props, advertising, and rights. If we exceed our fundraising goals, we will also be able to compensate the artists who have donated their time to our projects.</p>
<p>In gratitude for your donations, we have a range of perks from plants signed by the company members to Limited Edition Seedling Project trucker hats, to our soon to be famous autographs.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
</div>The long and the short of it is that your money is buying tickets for people who can't afford them. You are taking away one of the largest impediments to people accessing art. <div>You are also contributing to a truly unique science experiment. What discoveries could Galileo made without the Medici Family? You are our Medici Family. (Hopefully with fewer political murders).</div><div>
<br/><div><div><div>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are lots of reasons this could crash and burn.</p>
<p>We are going into this financially handicapped. $800 is simply not enough money to put on a show (in some cases, it doesn't even cover the cost of licensing the play). Fortunately, the generous Atlanta theatre community has been incredibly supportive of us thus far, and so some amazing commodities like venues and costumes have already been donated for some of our shows, so we are off to a good start.</p>
<p>But, even with free tickets, it can be hard to get people in the seats. We have to find a way to speak to our community. We can say confidently after our inaugural project of ""Serial Killers"", that we have this capability. We packed the back room at Manuel's Tavern for 4 weeks running with 5 bizarre 10 minute serial plays. It was a trial by fire, but it has already given us so much knowledge about what the people of Atlanta want to see, and we are ready to use that information to create a sell out season.</p>
<p>So yes, this all may go up in flames, but we think that is exactly where good art is made. It's only with great risk we can reap great reward.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We are starving artists. We get it if you can't financially contribute. Truly, the best way you can help us is by attending our productions and talking with us about what you liked, what you didn't like, and what you want to see more of. That is the kind of data we need to fulfill the scientific aspect of our mission.</p>
<p>Also, if you are in possession of a venue, costumes, cool props, lighting instruments or any other theatrical devices that you'd like to share we would be exceptionally grateful! Or maybe you have a few pesky community service hours to do- come volunteer as an usher or come work the box office, and we will attest that you are a contributing member of society.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why Antigone?</span></h3>
<h3><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'>My name is Abraham Benson-Goldberg, and I am directing a site-responsive outdoor movement-informed, 4-person adaptation of Antigone because I love this play. Simple as that. For the political intrigue and metaphor; for the emotional (non)catharsis of watching everything go horribly, horribly wrong.</span></h3>
<p>Although on the surface this is an outdoor production, with minimal production design and ""value,"" this is a production that believes in paying actors a decent wage, and paying off what it owes (rehearsal spaces, printing costs, etc). Your help helps us, even more importantly, create a piece of free theatre for our audience--no tickets, and no ticket prices.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are a working group of five: one director and four amazing actors. Noa, Shalhevet, and the (two) Tomers have gone above and beyond to create something from nothing, and tell this incredibly relevant tale of political shortsightedness and folly; which is also a tale of female approaches to the wielding of power in the public realm.</p>
<p>I'm asking for $1500, because I believe in paying my actors, and in paying them a fair wage for their labours. As each dollar is roughly 3.85 shekel, and I pay my actors in shekels, you can rest assured knowing that every dollar you donate is really making headway. Our largest cost is, of course, reimbursing actors for their time and travels (roughly 750-1000 shekel each). After this, your monies will go to paying for our rehearsal spaces; costuming and make-up; design and printing fees.</p>
<p>Our perks include copies of our working script; handwritten thank you post-cards from all of us; a skype conversation with one or more of us; and much, much more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This play is a chance for us to do several things. Firstly, to show the kids of this neighborhood that theatre can be done anywhere, any time. Second, to put on an amazing type of theatrical experience that normally isn't available to us, especially in Jerusalem. Finally, we get to tell a story about politics and politicking in the capital city of Israel!</p>
<p>For Noa, this play is a return to acting after half-a-year of maternity leave. For Shalhevet, this play is an incredible theatrical challenge. For Tomer Einav, this play is an opportunity to embrace a different style of play. Tomer Jacovchak is looking at this play as a chance to interrogate the ancients. And for me, it's an opportunity to yawp barbarically at Jerusalem.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have previously directed two other site-specific outdoor productions for little or no budget. SONG of SONGS for Camp Ramah in Wisconsin, and the ILIAD for Lovers &amp; Madmen at Northwestern University. I am a champion of directing outdoors for little to no money. But this time, let's try having cash!</p>
<p>There are, to be honest, very few risks: we have the cast, we have the text, we have the blocking. We do go up very shortly, and that is always challenging; and as outdoor performers we do have the specter of hecklers or having the police called upon us. Our approach to both has been thus far to be friendly and open about our process with our neighbors to the park and playground, and so far, we only have fans!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Just because you can't contribute financially doesn't mean you can't help! Any share you can make, anyone you feel like telling that ""they're doing an outdoors movement-y production of Antigone in the heart of Jerusalem,"" that's doing so much.</p>
<p>Get the word out, pay some actors, be the artistic change you want to see in the world.</p>

<h2>Prepare for a beast, at least a category four. <i>Hurricane Jimmy</i>, a steamy present-day musical noir is approaching!!</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About The Musical</h3>
<p>Set amongst an antebellum estate undergoing renovations deep within a Gulf Coast Bayou, <i>Hurricane Jimmy</i> is a steamy present-day musical noir, influenced by the Southern Gothic plays of Tenessee Williams and James M. Cain's <i>Double Indemnity</i>. We witness the tragic resurrection of entanglements between the wrong guy and a married femme fatale. Side by side, they know it will be impossible to stop themselves from an adulterous affair that will surely end in disaster. Told in stylistic detail with a deeply energetic score, <i>Hurricane Jimmy</i> begs us to reconcile with our pasts, while confronting our futures.    </p>
<p><i>Hurricane Jimmy</i> is a new musical featuring Book and Lyrics written by Lawrence Alexander and Music written by William Linster. </p>
<p>This project is being produced by John Bracken and Alana Roberts, Executive Producers, and Emilee Wermenchuk, Producer and Video Curator. </p>
<h3>About The Project</h3>
<p>We are working to design, implement, and secure a strong digital presence for <i>Hurricane Jimmy</i> through the creation of an official website, social media platforms, and a live-streamed musical event. Our live-stream event will feature a reading of <i>Hurricane Jimmy </i>followed by a talkback with members of the Creative Team and Producers.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>Like all good musicals, it takes financial backing from people like you to bring this show to fruition. </p>
<ul>
<li>We have a fundraising goal of $3000 to make <i>Hurricane Jimmy</i> into the musical we know it can be. Most importantly, this money will allow us to pay our artists. It will also ensure that we can cover all of the fees that we incur from the technology needed to design and implement the musical's digital presence. </li>
<li>This goal also gives us the opportunity to reward donors like you with some pretty unique opportunities! While we accept donations of any amount, we've created six recommended donation increments, each with unique perks. Highlights include official <i>Hurricane Jimmy </i>Merchandise, early access to promotional music videos, access to the official <i>Hurricane Jimmy</i> Cast Recording, and even your name featured as a Supporter or Investor on the Live Steam Event. </li>
<li>Please know that any remaining funds we do not use on the project will not benefit the Producers. Rather, these funds will go directly to Safe Horizons, a shelter for people fleeing domestic abuse situations as well as youth facing housing insecurity in the New York City area, as a donation on behalf of <i>Hurricane Jimmy</i>. </li>

<h3>About The Agency</h3>
<p>The Agency Theatre Collective is a non-profit theater company whose mission is to produce new and under-produced plays in Chicago. Since 2011, we have produced five world premieres, including the acclaimed <i>I Wish To Apologize To The People of Illinois</i> and the Jeff nominated <i>Truth in Context. </i>Our most recent production of <i>Chagrin Falls </i>by Mia McCullough was called “… intelligent, probing and compassionate” by Kerry Reid of the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<h3>About The Play</h3>
<p><i>Skin for Skin</i> depicts the biblical Job as a Muslim-American contractor in Baghdad who is suspected of aiding Al-Qaeda. He is imprisoned in an Abu Ghraib-type 'black site' and subjected to 'enhanced interrogation' as supervised by an American psychologist. The play explores the unintended consequences of torture in the name of God, country and money. <i>Skin for Skin</i>, originally read at Chicago Dramatists, features choreography from members of Chicago Danztheatre Ensemble and Actors Gymnasium.</p>
<h3>About The Playwright</h3>
<p>Paul Pasulka is a Chicago playwright and a clinical psychologist in private practice and on faculty at Northwestern University School of Medicine. His plays have been produced and read throughout Chicago and in New York. <i>La Maestra</i>, the story of Renaissance painter Artemisia Gentileschi, received a staged reading with dance, movement and song at Chicago DanzTheatre Ensemble in June 2016 and is scheduled for production in its 2017-18 season. <i>Gruoch, or Lady Macbeth</i> was produced by Death and Pretzels in 2015. <i>When the Levee Breaks</i> was produced as part of The Best of the 10's at Chicago Dramatists and Second City Theatre and was selected as a finalist and for publication at Secret Theatre in New York. <i>Dark Angels</i> was performed at the American Theatre Company (ATC) and Roberto Clemente High School in ATC's Bridge Program. He has worked with Adventure Stage Theatre in assisting middle school students in writing plays for Young Playwrights for Change.</p>
<p>He presented ""Neuropsychology, Creativity, and Storytelling"" at the Steel Pen Creative Writers' Conference in 2015.</p>
<p>He has presented autobiographical stories throughout Chicago, including at Rhinofest and with the GenNarrations Project of The Goodman Theatre, and was invited to read at The International Storytelling Festival in San Miguel Allende, Mexico in 2014.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing a play of any size is a major undertaking. Your contribution will help in offsetting those costs and allow us to bring the granular realism from the page to stage. Specifically, your donation will help us pay for: theater rental, costumes, set construction, lighting equipment, sound equipment, marketing costs, and paying our artists and crew. </p>
<p>Not only is your donation tax-deductible, we also have a few perks to say Thank You for your contrinition. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are sincerely grateful for any donation you can make to support our project. In addition to a donation, you can also help by sharing this campaign with your friends, family and co-workers. Also, we hope you'll come see our show!</p>

<p>From November 5th-14th, we
are presenting my two act play, <i>Devotion</i>
at Mad Lab Theater in Columbus, Ohio.  It
is set in the early 1990s in New York City, where a young,
female visual artist shares her loft with her current boyfriend, a
videographer, and, initially, with her ex-boyfriend, an actor. The actor wants
to reignite their relationship, but he is thwarted by his own previous
misbehavior as well as the new boyfriend’s zealous interference. The play
examines the pressures of making art and maintaining basic relationships under
the high pressure conditions of life in New York, and it is about the demands
that makes and the sacrifices it requires. In the end, it is the woman who gets
the first break, but at a cost to all of the characters.  You’ll wonder: what does devotion mean?  And to whom or what? </p>
<p>If the idea of supporting world
premiere new work is exciting to you, you like the idea of adding substantively
to the local theater scene, or you just like the concept of the play, please
support us financially.  We’ve got lots
of incentives for you at all levels and are grateful for any contribution you
can make.  </p>

<p>We feel it is important for <i>someone</i>
in the community to do original plays, because it offers a venue for those who
are interested in seeing new, unique work, and allows actors to stretch in
roles unfamiliar to them. Original work, especially original work performed where it is written, speaks to its particular time and place, as all art
inevitably does. So original plays come from a common context with their
audiences. They are the plays that can most disrupt and transform perceptions
precisely because they offer unknown texts, visions that are not pre-digested
or mediated by anyone else. It is the experience of play going in its rawest
form. </p>
<p>We also hope to nurture a
repertory company with a steady ensemble of paid actors, directors, and writers
that we work with on a regular basis. Our goal is not only to produce as many
world premieres as possible but to run all of them as long as possible and to
show them to as many people as possible. It is essential to have the talent
available to accomplish this, which means paying fair wages to artists who
contribute to the success of A&amp;B Theatricals. It is ultimately the <i>performance</i>
of a show that not only makes it a financial success but also completes the
play in the way it was intended.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>How do we guarantee an audience? That's where you come in!

Ka'iulani would have gone on to become queen of Hawai'i but for the annexation of her country by the United States. Ka'iulani, who is little known in the UK, was talented and beautiful. She was proud of her dual Scottish and Kanaka Maoli ancestry, and became a Victorian royal who could both surf - she was reputed to be quite skilled in wave riding - and play croquet.

<br/><p>I want the film to be very much rooted in the streets of Hove where she lived and must have spent her time.

<br/>The project includes:<br/><br/>1. A short film - a creative interpretation of the life of the Hawaiian princess Ka'iulani and her time in Hove.

</p><p><b><i>Mother, Mother </i></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> is a journalistic theater piece about contemporary parenthood, based
on interviews with a diverse group of mothers.  <b><i>Mother, Mother</i></b> examines the issues of gender equity, economic disparity, and cultural pressure that disproportionately impact many of today's mothers.  We are collecting interviews in a variety of locations throughout the United States, as well as in Sweden.  Through examining the daily lives of mothers in these very different cultures, we ask: <b>""Whose responsibility is it to respond to the changing needs of mothers and families?""</b></span></p>
<p>This piece is being developed by a
group of theater artists who are also currently mothers to young children. Part
of our process has been to examine the specific
challenges of creating family forward workplace flexibility in the theater. One
outcome of this project will be a comprehensive body of research on improving conditions
for parents who work in the theater.</p><p><b>Who we are: </b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><i>Mother, Mother </i></b>is directed and written by PETE co-founder Kate Sanderson Holly, who has created over ten full-length original, ensemble-devised theatre productions, and specializes in Contemporary Performance practice.  She has teamed up with Sojourn Theatre's Hannah Treuhaft, who brings to the project an expertise in combining artistic innovation with theater for social change and community dialogue.  Other key collaborators include </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Catherine Ming T'ien Duffly

Mother, Mother  is a journalistic theater piece about contemporary parenthood, based
on interviews with a diverse group of mothers.  Mother, Mother examines the issues of gender equity, economic disparity, and cultural pressure that disproportionately impact many of today's mothers.  We are collecting interviews in a variety of locations throughout the United States, as well as in Sweden.  Through examining the daily lives of mothers in these very different cultures, we ask: ""Whose responsibility is it to respond to the changing needs of mothers and families?""
This piece is being developed by a
group of theater artists who are also currently mothers to young children. Part
of our process has been to examine the specific
challenges of creating family forward workplace flexibility in the theater. One
outcome of this project will be a comprehensive body of research on improving conditions
for parents who work in the theater.Who we are: Mother, Mother is directed and written by PETE co-founder Kate Sanderson Holly, who has created over ten full-length original, ensemble-devised theatre productions, and specializes in Contemporary Performance practice.  She has teamed up with Sojourn Theatre's Hannah Treuhaft, who brings to the project an expertise in combining artistic innovation with theater for social change and community dialogue.  Other key collaborators include Catherine Ming T'ien Duffly
(Assistant Professor of Theater at Reed College); and ensemble members Aiyana
Cunningham, Sofia Dubrawsky, and Nikki Weaver (Co-Founder of Portland
Playhouse).  Mother, Mother is produced by PETE (www.petensemble.org) , in collaboration with Sojourn Theatre (http://www.sojourntheatre.com).  Where we are now: We are currently at the end of our first year of research and development.  In this time, we have held workshops with groups of mothers to facilitate conversation and generate key ideas, we have conducted interviews with dozens of mothers from a variety of locations, and we have built an extensive body of research from non-fiction sources, including media representation and statistical data.  We are now in the process of transforming this content into a compelling live theatrical event. We are still at the beginning stages of our rehearsal process, but we will be marking the end of this first phase of development with a work-in-progress showing for the public on March 22nd and 23rd, 2014. In the next phase of work, we will expand our research to include interviews with mothers from throughout the United States, as well as in Sweden.  We will craft this content into a full production of the piece, scheduled to premiere in 2015.  Why we need you:  We were very fortunate to receive support from a learning exchange grant through the Network of Ensemble Theaters.  This grant helped us to launch the project, but does not completely cover the costs of our work-in-progress showing.  Your contribution will allow us to compensate the artists for their time and childcare expenses.  In addition, your support will enable us to carry the project forward into our next stage of development, where we move toward a full production.  This is the most vital time for you to contribute to the project, as meeting our goal will ensure that we can continue this work.  What are you helping us to do?  Mother, Mother is facilitating meaningful public discourse around the most pressing issues facing today's mothers and families.  The mother stories we have collected so far point to some significant gaps in public policy, infrastructural support, and cultural change when it comes to ensuring a sustainable future for families.  These stories highlight and complement the statistical data that so many social scientists and political advocacy groups have compiled:  -The wage gap disproportionately impacts mothers: Mothers earn 60 cents for every dollar a father makes, while women without children earn 94 cents for every dollar childless men are paid.-Motherhood is the leading indicator of poverty in old age-Single motherhood is the leading indicator of poverty at any age-The United States is one of only 4 countries in the world that does not guarantee paid maternity leave to its mothers.  The outcomes of this can be seen in many of the stories we have collected, from the single mom who ended up in a homeless shelter with her newborn, to the mom who lost her place in a prestigious Phd program.  We believe this is a conversation that everybody should be participating in, and the stories we are sharing get to the heart of these issues in ways that will both entertain and educate you.  What We Need & What You GetAt this time, we need $5000 to get through our work-in-progress showing and launch the next phase of development.  Your money will go to:  -Artist compensation.  We are all theater professionals who have been working in this field for a decade or more.  Adequate compensation is a fundamental part of sustaining high-quality performance.  -Child care costs.  As mothers to young children, it can be very expensive just to make time to work.  An ongoing goal of this process is to raise enough funding to partially cover the cost of the child care that is making this show possible.  -Boost into the future.  The financial support that launched this project will be gone by the end of March, but our project is far from finished.  Help us keep moving it forward!  Perks:  As an investor in this piece, you should get some of the returns!  We offer some great perks, and because we are a 501 (c) 3, all of your donations are tax deductible (minus the market value of the perk that you choose).

Started by Bob Linebarger and Denver Little in 2012, Different Choices have put on two productions so far: ""The Bottom of Everything"", an original play written by Denver Little, in 2012 and ""Danny and the Deep Blue Sea"" in 2014, usually presented as a heavy drama, but interpreted more as a romantic dark comedy under the direction of Bob Linebarger. </p>
<h3><i>Matt and Ben</i></h3>
</div><p>Now, Different Choices is BACK with another production in mind. This one is a wonderfully hilarious play called <i>Matt and Ben</i>. Written by Mindy Kaling (Kelly from ""The Office"", ""The Mindy Project"") and Brenda Withers, this play is about a young Matt Damon and Ben Affleck writing their Academy Award winning script of <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, but approaches it as if the script literally just fell from the sky. </p><h3>Why <i>Matt and Ben</i>?</h3><p><i>Matt and Ben</i> is a play close to the hearts of Bob and Denver, for many reasons. One, it is a play about two long-time friends creating art together, and the successes and failures that come with. Bob and Denver have known each other for longer than they can remember, so they feel this play represents a good portrait of their lives and their long-time friendship. Also, Bob and Denver did high school forensics together and presented a 10 minute cutting of <i>Matt and Ben</i>, and ended up getting 16th at a national forensics competition. So producing the full production of this play is a ""bucket-list"" choice and what a better time to cross it off our bucket lists while we are still young!</p><h3>What is the Different Choice?</h3><div>Our different choice is not necessarily in the interpretation of this play, but more in the production of it. In forensics, Denver and I collaborated to put together many pieces. For <i>Matt and Ben</i>, we are going to approach it just like one of those pieces, and play almost every part in the production process. This means we are going to be producing, directing, acting and designing this play together. If there was a tagline to what we are doing, it would be: ""Just two guys puttin' on a show"". We at Different Choices enjoy and support those who produce their own work, and we want to play a part in making producing look simpler. Not easier, as producing will always be a difficult and tedious task, but if producing can be made simpler, maybe more artists will feel more confident in producing. There are so many great artists in KC and Different Choices wants to see all of them working!!</div><h3>How Will Your Donation Help?</h3><p>Although Different Choices operates on a ""no-budget theater"" mindset, there are things we have to pay for that are outside of our ability to pay for ourselves. For example, the venue cost to produce at The Buffalo Room for a two-week run is $1500. Also, the rights to this play are around $700. We also want to pay for the few people we do bring in to help, including a stage manager. So your donation will not only help us put on this great production, but is essential to the life of this production. </p><h3>Anything Else?</h3><div>Yes, actually! Every show we produce from this show forward will donate part of the proceeds made to a charity that fits the show. The charity we chose for <i>Matt and Ben</i> is WATER.ORG. We chose water.org because it is the main charity Matt Damon and Ben Affleck advocate for, and after reading everything that water.org does for the world, providing water to those far less fortunate than us in Kansas City, we are ecstatic to donate to such a great cause.

</p><p><b>ABOUT
THE PLAY AND THE TEAM </b></p>
<p><i>Down the Road</i> by Lee Blessing is a crime drama about a
crime writing couple, a serial killer and how far they will go to write a book. </p>
<p>Husband and wife, Dan
and Iris Henniman travel to an isolated town with only a couple gas stations,
McDonalds, a motel and a prison. They have been hired to write an
account on William Reach's crimes, specifically nineteen women he has murdered.
Throughout the play we learn that there may have been more than the nineteen
victims. As Iris tries to get into Reach's head more and more, she soon ponders
the ethics of what she and Dan are doing and wonders are they, in fact,
glorifying a serial killer? Is there even a way to resolve this twisted
controversy?  </p>
<p>The play is Gretchen

<p>This is more of a risk for us than it is for

<br/></div>","ABOUT
THE PLAY AND THE TEAM 
Down the Road by Lee Blessing is a crime drama about a
crime writing couple, a serial killer and how far they will go to write a book. 
Husband and wife, Dan
and Iris Henniman travel to an isolated town with only a couple gas stations,
McDonalds, a motel and a prison. They have been hired to write an
account on William Reach's crimes, specifically nineteen women he has murdered.
Throughout the play we learn that there may have been more than the nineteen
victims. As Iris tries to get into Reach's head more and more, she soon ponders
the ethics of what she and Dan are doing and wonders are they, in fact,
glorifying a serial killer? Is there even a way to resolve this twisted
controversy?  
The play is Gretchen
Hannah Burke and Claire Buckley's senior project. They are each students in the Theatre and Performance
program at SUNY Purchase College. 
Down the Road will be presented in the Humanities Theatre in
the Durst Humanities Building at SUNY Purchase College on February 18th -
20th.

<p><span>Hello, my name is Victoria Bourne and I am the artistic director of the Bristol based production company And Then We Danced. We aim to inspire people of all backgrounds to experience and participate in music, whether engaging them with live performances of original music theatre or providing them with access to workshops, choirs and individual tuition.</span></p>
<p><span>Our campaign is to raise funds to help us take our show 'Rouse Ye Women' to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2013. We have already been successfully offered a performance slot and are fully registered for the fringe as part of </span><span>C</span><span> venues in </span><span>C </span><span>venue Aquila on the Royal Mile.

<p><span>Rouse Ye Women’ tells the story of the chain-making women from the Black Country once known as the ʻwhite slaves of Englandʼ. Small chains - known as 'hand-hammered' or 'country-work' chains - were often hand-worked by women or children in small cramped forges in outbuildings next to their homes. An example of the 'sweated trade', the work was hot, physically demanding and very poorly paid. In 1910, after a ten week strike, the women won a landmark victory that established the first minimum wage in this country.</span></p>
<p><span>Our interpretation of this dramatic story is an enthralling and surprising piece of music theatre and takes its name from the principle song - ʻRouse ye Womenʼ. The story is being told through a mix of music, movement and lyrics with female singers simultaneously playing metallic percussion to create an appropriate sonic landscape for the story. </span></p>

<p>Support OWLS (Outreach With Lacrosse &amp; Schools), a Chicago-based volunteer organization dedicated to starting transformative lacrosse programs for inner-city schools and communities. OWLS has a dynamic, sustainable approach to sport development for at-risk inner-city youth based on:</p>
<p>● Teambuilding</p>
<p>● Healthy lifestyles</p>
<p>● Academic achievement</p>
<p><span>Sam Angelotta, Founder and Program Director for OWLS is leading the effort to improve and expand our programming to reach more inner-city kids. Originally from Ohio, he is a graduate and lacrosse alum of Indiana University and DePaul University. Following graduation from Indiana, he went on to coach, teach, and play lacrosse in Manchester, England as a Local Development Officer for the English Lacrosse Association. During his time there he helped organize and develop programs for schools in Manchester, as well as a local club team. Following the completion of the program he earned his Masters in Elementary Education from DePaul University. During this period of hands-on research in Chicago schools he established the OWLS organization as a response to the need for quality after-school/healthy lifestyle programs for at-risk youth. The pilot program for OWLS was launched two years ago at St. Malachy School (West Side, Chicago) where he currently works as a full-time elementary teacher, coach, and program director.  </span></p>
<p>Over the last two years, hundreds of our student-athletes have experienced quality lacrosse instruction, courses in team-building, and first hand exposure to top-tier high schools and universities.</p>
<p>Our School-2-School Initiative has successfully connected established high school and college lacrosse programs with OWLS inner city school sites. This initiative has helped our boys and girls gain exposure to top-level programs through sport and academic enrichment. Through School-2-School we have been able to connect with elite NCAA programs in the country, including Northwestern University Women’s Lacrosse and University of Notre Dame Men’s Lacrosse, and local teams, including St. Ignatius College Prep, Loyola Academy, New Trier High School, Naperville North HS, Whitney Young HS, Neaqua Valley HS, and Benet Academy.</p>
<p><br/>Our success has created demand for OWLS in more inner-city schools. We are currently improving four school-based OWLS Inner-City Development Projects:</p>
<p>● St. Anns School</p>
<p>● St. Malachy School</p>
<p>● Chicago Jesuit Academy</p>
<p>● John Marshall Metropolitan High School</p>
<p>These new programs will be the foundation for our vision of an Urban Scholastic Lacrosse League (USLL), scheduled for launch this spring. As all of our students play for FREE, we are seeking to raise $15,000 to support this vision. We are asking the greater community to help this holiday season.</p>
<p>From December 18th to February 5th we will be featuring a fundraising video highlighting our recent lacrosse development projects through the OWLS School-2-School Program. This short video will give you an exclusive look into our program and the student-athletes that make it thrive. Give the gift of lacrosse this season, help us build inner-city student-athletes!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where will the $15,000 Go?</h3>
<p>To give you a sense of our programming costs here's a breakdown:</p>
<p>$25 provides insurance and US Lacrosse membership (Lacrosse Magazine subscription) for one student</p>
<p>$50 provides uniform, shorts, and supplemental equipment (mouthguard, cup, water bottle etc.) for one student.</p>
<p>$100 provides team bus transportation for one event/game</p>
<p>$250 provides lacrosse equipment for one student</p>
<p>$500 allows one participant to attend summer camp</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Marlo Berberian. I am the treasurer of Denver School of the Art's Thespian Officer Board. Denver School of the Arts is a magnet middle and high school that specializes in enriching kid's passions for the arts. We have ten majors including: theatre, dance, band, orchestra, guitar, piano, visual arts, cinema, tech, and creative writing. The thespian society is an international high school honors society focusing on all things related to theatre. This year, we have had more national qualifiers than ever before. This is a huge triumph for our school because it gives kids from all majors the opportunity to perform in front of an international audience and connect with theatre lovers from all over the world. The only problem is we don't have sufficient funds to get there. In order to perform at nationals we need to raise $5000 dollars. It would be such a blessing if we could pay for transportation to and from nationals for our entire troupe.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we are able to get to nationals our students will not only be able to watch and learn by seeing performances from all over the nation, but they will also have the chance to audition for several colleges and scholarships. Because colleges from all over the US attend nationals, students who would usually not have the opportunity to visit and audition for schools outside of the state can and earn scholarships. If we can't get to nationals this incredible experience would not be possible. Students could not audition for their colleges of choice or get to perform and receive feedback from theatre aficionados from all over the country. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $5000 in order to have full transportation to and from nationals. It is about $2500 each way. If this goal is met we will be able to safely get to nationals without having to put stress on families to drive their children for 10-12 hours each way. If our goal is not met, whatever we have will go into the transportation budget and we will request a small check from each family to contribute towards the bus. Asking for a small check of $25 is a lot less than asking for $200 which most of our families can't afford. Any donation would help us come closer to our goal and towards an exciting and educational trip. <br/></p>

Any donation would help us come closer to our goal and towards an exciting and educational trip.

have enough ‘physical evidence’ of her sexuality and thus had to be sent home.

and trawling through cases. The deeper he dug into the issue, the crueler and

<p>Bob Dylan? Check. Allen Ginsberg? Check. David Mamet, Flannery O’Connor, The Ronettes, Charles Schulz, Rod Serling, Strunk &amp; White, August Wilson, &amp; Warren Zevon? Check - all down the line.</p>
<p>In two years and twenty-seven unique productions, First Person Singular has presented the American voice at its most compelling and essential. Character plus language equals voice, and it’s our mission to provide a routine reckoning with the glorious and terrifying noise this nation has made. </p>
<p>We serve the voices that define us. And now it’s time to speak for ourselves.</p>
<h2><span>Ahem</span></h2>
<p>On December 3rd, 2012, First Person Singular will present it’s first program of original material: <em>Hear Me Now:</em> Cell Phone Monologues. We’re going to take the unsolicited public theater you witness on a daily basis, and put it in a proper context. </p>
<p>We’re calling on the strongest writer-performers of the Bay Area to demonstrate what this relatively new form of exhibitionism can inadvertently, and entertainingly, reveal.</p>
<p>Our Cast:</p>
<p><strong>Trevor Allen</strong>, playwright and solo theater performer (<em>49 Miles; The Creature; Working for the Mouse</em>)</p>
<p><span><strong>Kim Addonizio</strong>, poet &amp; novelist (<em>Jimmy &amp; Rita; Lucifer at the Starlite; Tell Me</em>)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alicia Dattner</strong>, comedian &amp; solo theater writer-performer (<em>Eat, Pray, Laugh; The Punchline; The Oy of Sex)</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Marga Gomez</strong>, comedian (HBO; Showtime) &amp; solo theater writer-performer (<em>Long Island Iced Latina; Marga Gomez is Pretty, Witty &amp; Gay; Not Getting Any Younger</em>)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Christopher Kuckenbaker</strong>, actor &amp; playwright (<em>The Burroughs and Kookie Show</em>)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Eddie Muller</strong>, writer (<em>The Distance; Grindhouse; Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir</em>), founder of The Film Noir Foundation and The Noir City Film Festival</span></p>
<p><span><strong>April Sinclair</strong>, novelist (<em>I Left My Back Door Open; Coffee Will Make You Black; Ain't Gonna Be the Same Fool Twice)</em></span></p>
<p>Note:<strong> IanShoales</strong> (Merle Kessler), writer, humorist (<em>NPR's All Things Considered; Morning Edition; ABC's Nightline</em>), &amp; founding member of Duck's Breath Mystery Theater, was part of our original lineup, but he is recuperating from a recent traffic mishap. We wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
<h2><span>How You Can Help</span></h2>
<p>Our costs for the production are more than twice what ticket revenue can cover. This is a one-night-only performance, and we’re asking a host of top talent to both write and perform original material for it.

Bringing dynamic performers to timeless material in original programs, the series places special emphasis on the richness, variety, and vitality of the American voice. From August Wilson to Warren Zevon, from a 60's girl-group song recital to an all-female reading of <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>, First Person Singular showcases the best of our culture in unique and unexpected ways. <span>The series has been presented by </span>Pegasus Books, </span><span>The Museum of the African Diaspora<span>, </span></span><span><span><span>The Shotgun Players, </span></span>and Litquake.

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","American Classics, Served Fresh
Bob Dylan? Check. Allen Ginsberg? Check. David Mamet, Flannery O’Connor, The Ronettes, Charles Schulz, Rod Serling, Strunk & White, August Wilson, & Warren Zevon? Check - all down the line.
In two years and twenty-seven unique productions, First Person Singular has presented the American voice at its most compelling and essential. Character plus language equals voice, and it’s our mission to provide a routine reckoning with the glorious and terrifying noise this nation has made. 
We serve the voices that define us. And now it’s time to speak for ourselves.
Ahem
On December 3rd, 2012, First Person Singular will present it’s first program of original material: Hear Me Now: Cell Phone Monologues. We’re going to take the unsolicited public theater you witness on a daily basis, and put it in a proper context. 
We’re calling on the strongest writer-performers of the Bay Area to demonstrate what this relatively new form of exhibitionism can inadvertently, and entertainingly, reveal.
Our Cast:
Trevor Allen, playwright and solo theater performer (49 Miles; The Creature; Working for the Mouse)
Kim Addonizio, poet & novelist (Jimmy & Rita; Lucifer at the Starlite; Tell Me)
Alicia Dattner, comedian & solo theater writer-performer (Eat, Pray, Laugh; The Punchline; The Oy of Sex)
Marga Gomez, comedian (HBO; Showtime) & solo theater writer-performer (Long Island Iced Latina; Marga Gomez is Pretty, Witty & Gay; Not Getting Any Younger)
Christopher Kuckenbaker, actor & playwright (The Burroughs and Kookie Show)
Eddie Muller, writer (The Distance; Grindhouse; Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir), founder of The Film Noir Foundation and The Noir City Film Festival
April Sinclair, novelist (I Left My Back Door Open; Coffee Will Make You Black; Ain't Gonna Be the Same Fool Twice)
Note: IanShoales (Merle Kessler), writer, humorist (NPR's All Things Considered; Morning Edition; ABC's Nightline), & founding member of Duck's Breath Mystery Theater, was part of our original lineup, but he is recuperating from a recent traffic mishap. We wish him a speedy recovery.
How You Can Help
Our costs for the production are more than twice what ticket revenue can cover. This is a one-night-only performance, and we’re asking a host of top talent to both write and perform original material for it. We’re also commissioning a series of ringtone-based musical interstitials from pianist Joshua Raoul Brody. We have a stage manager and co-director whom we’d like to offer more than dinner. In addition, we have printing costs for posters, programs, and scripts. But ninety percent of your contributions will help pay artists. 
We want our first original program to stand with the work that has come before it. So, we’re going for broke.
This campaign goes live on Thanksgiving (our favorite holiday) for a twelve-day funding blitz. Our goal is modest, and tailored to this production, but the future of the series would greatly benefit from contributions above our stated goal.

<p>Topsy-Turvy is a labor of love for us (India Davis &amp; Indi McCasey). We wanted to see something that we had never seen before: an explicitely all-queer circus performance that highlighted circus artists of color and created safe space for trans and gender variant performers. We also wanted to connect queers to the magic of circus and ultimately to each other.</p>
<p>With this in mind we created Topsy-Turvy, a one-of-a-kind performance that will spin your world upside-down! As part of the 2013 National Queer Arts Festival, Topsy-Turvy reinvents circus arts with acts that defy traditional ideals of strength and beauty, integrate multiple disciplines of dance and performance, and tell a distinctly queer narrative.</p>
<p>Topsy-Turvy will feature circus artists from New York, Colorado, New Mexico, Vermont, Portland, and the Bay Area performing circus disciplines including trapeze, lyra, stilts, acro, juggling, and more!</p>
<div>
<h2>Why are we asking for money?</h2>
<p>In order to bring circus artists from across the country to the Bay Area, these performers have had to dig into their own pockets to front travel costs. Additionally, circus is an artform that can require long hours of training and expensive gear. We want to fully appreciate the time and energy these artists have put into creating their acts and that's why we're asking for support from our community.</p>
<p><strong>With $2,500 we will pay a portion of travel expenses for out-of-town artists as well as contribute to the general pot for performers. The more that we raise, the more we can give back to these incredible artists!</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Mechanical</strong> is an original post-apocalyptic musical following the journey of a humanoid robot as he ventures onto the surface of the earth for the very first time. What does he find there? Well, we could tell you, but that wouldn't be very fun, would it? Follow our journey and maybe you'll find out! </p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical</strong> is co-written by Marcus Bagala, Megan Dorn, and Kelsey Hercs. Marcus is a recent graduate of The Berklee College of Music, and Megan and Kelsey are recent graduates of The Boston Conservatory of Music. Since its conception, the show has undergone major surgery - characters were added and taken away, scenes were cut, edited and re-written, and readings were held. But we need your help taking the show from the page to the stage. </p>
<p>Our first scheduled performance will be at the <strong>2013 </strong><strong>PortFringe Festival</strong>, happening this June. We are relying on your contributions to bring our show to life! </p>

<p>I'm Katie Stahl-Kovell, a 2nd year PHD Critical Dance Studies and MA Southeast Asian Studies student at the University of California, Riverside. My dissertation work focuses on Cambodian Classical dance, a dance that is very much alive today in Cambodia and around the world.</p>
<p>Khmer Classical dance dates back to arguably the 6th century CE. It was a royal court dance and was viably threatened during the Khmer Rouge Genocide from 1975-1979. Over 2 million people were killed.  Over 90% of dance artisans were murdered during this era.  Many dancers who managed to survive, such as Sophiline Cheam Shapiro--a famous dance choreographer and performer who started Khmer Arts--have dedicated their lives to the preservation of this beautiful and ancient dance.</p>
<p>I have conducted ethnographic fieldwork with the Cambodian community in Long Beach, CA USA for almost three years, now.  I learn Khmer Classical dance from Prumsodun Ok, who is the student of Sophiline Cheam Shapiro, at Khmer Arts Academy in Long Beach, CA.  The Academy is the community based sister-school to the professional organization in Cambodia--where I will be photo documenting dance. </p>
<p>For the past three years I have photographed dancers in Long Beach.  This project's focus in on Khmer Arts Ensemble--the professional troupe in Cambodia.</p>

<li>Intensively study the Khmer language, the language of Cambodia, at the Center for Khmer Studies in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  This six-week intensive language and culture program will train me to speak, read, and write Khmer at a conversational level.</li>
<li>Photo document Cambodian Classical dancers in professional ensembles such as Khmer Arts Ensemble.</li>
</ol><p>In Fall 2013 or early 2014 the photographs I take in Cambodia will be published into a full color print book to buy!</p>
<h2>Why Do We Need this Photo-Book?</h2>
<p>There is a <em>great lack</em> of accurate information and current photography of Cambodian Classical dance and dancers. The <strong>GOAL</strong> for this project is to publish my photographic work into a photo-book that is affordable and informative. The intended audiences for the photo-book are 1) Cambodian Community members including Khmer Classical dancers, 2) Cambodian Elementary Educators and Students, &amp; 3) United States Elementary Educators and Students. </p>
<p>I hope to have enough funding to provide several elementary schools and orphanages within Cambodian and within the United States with free copies of this book.</p>
<p>The captions of the photos will be in English. If funding allows, I will hire a translator to translate descriptions of the photos into Khmer and possibly French.</p>
<h2><strong>Fund this Community Based Project!</strong></h2>
<p>I have asked for $3500 to cover my air travel to Cambodia, part of my room &amp; board, and extracurricular costs (such as donations to the dance associations I work with). </p>
<p>My air travel: $1900 + my accomodations: $1200 for three months + estimated extracurricular costs associated with the dancers: $400.  Indiegogo takes 4% of the total funds raised.</p>
<p>My camera equipment is funded by me, without the aid of Indiegogo. The funding will be strictly used for travel, room &amp; board, and costs associated with working with the dancers.</p>
<p>There are MANY perks for funding this community based project! Check it out to the right--do not hesitate to e-mail me at <a href=""mailto:kstah001@ucr.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">kstah001@ucr.edu</a> if you have any queries.</p>
<h3><strong>***Each person who donates will have their name written in the acknowledgements of the book!</strong></h3>
<h2><strong>Who Gets the Proceeds?</strong></h2>
<p>Upon publishing this book, the proceeds will <strong>go back to help fund the dancers and dance associations/professional organizations such as Khmer Arts Ensemble.  I will not keep any of the proceeds.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help!</strong></h2>
<p>Please spread the word about this project! I am very excited to not only have the privilege to travel to Cambodia, but also to have the wonderful Cambodian Community in Long Beach, California supporting me.</p>

I'm Katie Stahl-Kovell, a 2nd year PHD Critical Dance Studies and MA Southeast Asian Studies student at the University of California, Riverside. My dissertation work focuses on Cambodian Classical dance, a dance that is very much alive today in Cambodia and around the world.
Khmer Classical dance dates back to arguably the 6th century CE. It was a royal court dance and was viably threatened during the Khmer Rouge Genocide from 1975-1979. Over 2 million people were killed.  Over 90% of dance artisans were murdered during this era.  Many dancers who managed to survive, such as Sophiline Cheam Shapiro--a famous dance choreographer and performer who started Khmer Arts--have dedicated their lives to the preservation of this beautiful and ancient dance.
I have conducted ethnographic fieldwork with the Cambodian community in Long Beach, CA USA for almost three years, now.  I learn Khmer Classical dance from Prumsodun Ok, who is the student of Sophiline Cheam Shapiro, at Khmer Arts Academy in Long Beach, CA.  The Academy is the community based sister-school to the professional organization in Cambodia--where I will be photo documenting dance. 
For the past three years I have photographed dancers in Long Beach.  This project's focus in on Khmer Arts Ensemble--the professional troupe in Cambodia.
The Project: A Self-Published Photo-Book!
This Summer I'm headed to Phnom Penh to:

Intensively study the Khmer language, the language of Cambodia, at the Center for Khmer Studies in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  This six-week intensive language and culture program will train me to speak, read, and write Khmer at a conversational level.
Photo document Cambodian Classical dancers in professional ensembles such as Khmer Arts Ensemble.
In Fall 2013 or early 2014 the photographs I take in Cambodia will be published into a full color print book to buy!

<h3>More About MARRIED SEX, the Play</h3>
<p>My name is Laura Zam and for the last 20 years I've been creating one-person pieces for the stage that deal with social issues. I've performed my work in many well-known venues, including the Kennedy Center, the National Theatre, and Off-Broadway. MARRIED SEX is the culmination of all this work. It is my life's work!  <strong>In MARRIED SEX, I portray 30 people who have questions about sex.</strong> This play was commissioned by a professional theater in DC, Theater J, directed by Shirley Serotsky. After sold-out shows in DC and a stop in Minneapolis, this play is opening in the New York International Fringe Festival. (This festival is very difficult to get into, and I am honored to be a part of it.) MARRIED SEX was also was a semi-finalist for a very prestigious honor: <a href=""http://www.theoneill.org/summer-conferences/npc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The O'Neill National Playwrights Conference</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why I Wrote This Play</strong></h3>
<p>When I was very young I experienced sexual abuse perpetrated by two neighbors. In the years since, I have asked many questions about sex, relationships and sexual trauma. Luckily, I have found some answers. I wrote MARRIED SEX not just to entertain (the show is audaciously funny), but also to help people who have experienced trauma. MARRIED SEX is equally for people who just have questions about sex. Let's face it: sex and relationships are confusing... and absurdly funny.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>This project answers questions about sex -- and it does so with humor! </strong><a href=""http://www.fringenyc.org/basic_page.php?ltr=M"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here is a link to a listing in the New York International Fringe Festival!</a></em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What if I'm Not Married? </h3>
<p>MARRIED SEX, true to its name, is about long-term relationships. However, it's also about pleasure, intimacy and love, especially in relationship with ourselves!  The play is about all the things we are married to--our baggage, our hope, our ability to transform ourselves and each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is the Larger Project?</h3>
<p>The project built around this play combines theater with innovative outreach that includes informational e-books, a published memoir, and brunches that provide sex ed for adults--often with mimosas! </p>
<p><strong><em>My mission is to Tame the Shame associated with discussions around sex.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3>More About Me</h3>
<p>Over the past two decades I've won many awards and honors, including a Tennesse Williams Fellowship, an Open Society Fund grant and an Artist Fellowship from the DC Commmission on the Arts and Humanities.  I've been featured on NPR, in the Huffington Post, and have had my work filmed for ABC-TV. Also, for the past 15 years, I have worked directly with trauma survivors, urban teens, and regular ol' folks, using writing and performance as expressive/healing modalities.
